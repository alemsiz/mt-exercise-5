Last year, I showed these slides to show that the article that the article calculum that for almost three million years has had the size of the 48 United States has 48 continental continental continental continental -- and a 40 percent.
But this underlying gravity of the problem because it doesn't show the ice of the ice.
The article at glacial glacial system, is a way, the global customer of the global climate system.
It expand the winter and return return it into the summer.
The next slide is going to be a quick faster on the last 25 years.
The ice lost of them are signed in red red.
As you see, they expand they expand the Europe of the Europe --
That's the ice in winter that reverse reward.
You can see that the cheap ice of the same as a blood, five years or more, it's like the blood, here is like the blood here from the body.
In 25 years has been on this in 25 years from this.
This is a problem because the interest is the very interested in the ground of the ocean around the artc of the ocean where there are huge amount of carbon and the meter and the meter from the microbes.
It respect to the totality of the global warming, that amount of global warming, that amount could double that is double this point of not return.
In some deep deep in Alaska is already rebolling from the water.
The professorse Katey Walter of the University of Alaska team of the Alaska team of last last really.
Video: Wow! Al Gore: She is good. The question is if we will be done.
A reason is that this termal scale the Greenland, the North Groenland,
This is a glacial record.
The laughed has never reached levels.
This is the Kangerlussuaq, in the Southwest of Groenlland,
If you want to know how the sea level of the sea ice of ice on the ground, here is where the sea.
These currently are increasing rapidly.
On the other part of the planet.
The scientists have said that the scientists have said that the ice of the ice is negative, and that the West Antarcky Western Antarcky Western -- is particularly quickly in the skie.
Equival to six meters of water, like in Groenlland, like in Groenlland,
Himalaya, the third largest block of ice, you see new laghi, and see new laghi, who were glacious
The one percent of the world population received half the pounds of the pool.
Sulle Andelle is the source of the pot water from this city.
The brought is increased.
But when it decrease it looks at the potable water.
In California snow on the Sierra Nevada 40 percent.
Midries are in crisis.
Spushes as you have ready, they're grave.
Supity growing in the world leads to a remarkable increase of the incendes.
The disastery is increasing a rhythm and previous recedented a receive out of the normal and without previous reping a rhythm out of the normal and without previous precedenteds.
Four more numbers in the last 30 years than the previous 75.
This is a whole whole thing that is unsustainable.
If you look at it in historical context if you can see the consequences.
In the last five years we put 70 million tons of CO2 to 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the ocean every day.
Look at the East Scil Pacific, the Americh, in the west, and both of the Indian Indian continent -- where there is a radical radical oxygen.
The greatest cause, global warming, together to deforestation, which is 20 percent, which is the use of fossil fuel --
On the oil is a problem, and the carbon is even worse.
The United States are one of the two countries with more emissions, with China.
And he proposed to build many other central other carbon cents of carbon on on things.
But we're seeing a direction.
These are the projects annulled in the last few years and some evidence of green alternative versus of the real proposites.
Every way, there's a political lotta in our country.
The carbon industry and oil industry has spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote carbon clean clean and oxymore.
That image me reminds me of something,
Very Natal, in Tennessee, where I live -- there's been a 3.8 billion gallons of carbon dixieter dixide of carbon dixiety of carbon dixieter in the Natalal;
Maybe you saw it on the news of the news
This is the second big flow of scale in America.
It happened around Natal.
The natalization of one of the carbon industry was this one.
Video: Frosty the carbon is a fallegry and happy.
It's abundant here in America, and it makes our economy.
Frosty the carbon is increasingly more and more cleaner.
It's a good price, adorable and the workers of the workers are main the southern and the jobs are repend.
Al Gore: From here is a lot of cooking West Virginia.
The biggest society on the mountains is Massey Coal.
Video: Don Blland, and Sarrym: Sarrymed -- not what they're talking about.
Al Gore: So the Alliance for the Clima Proteation has launched two campags.
This is a part of a way.
Video: ALere: ALergy we see the climate changes as a nighty night as a night-up to our business.
So this is a great amount of money in a great amount of money in a brilliant effort to make public and consticks and constuse the carbon truth and constict truth and constitutes the carbon truth and a carbon truth and a constantly consuming the amount of money in a remark
In fact, carbon is not spore.
We think it's cleaned -- has a good profume.
So not predicted about climate change.
Let me do us.
Video: Adthe: Carbon -- you have heard a lot of it.
So let's do it a whole pattern around a structure of the structure of the clean as a clean as a clean as a cleaning carbon as well.
Straordinary! The machines are a little bit noise, but this is the sound of the clean technology of cleaning.
The carbon consumer is between the main causing global warming, but the remarkable technology of the clean that you see it change.
To look at this is the odiernaked out of the fuel of coals.
Al Gore: Infinally, the positive alternative networks and the economic issues that of national security.
Video: Same -- America, it's crisi; the American economy, national security crisis.
The file that connects to the whole issue -- our dependence from fossil fuel and oil and oil oil oil oil and matter.
Now, yet, there's a new solution to uscircles.
Rear America: 100 percent of clean energy in a decade.
A plan to re-the people to work, make us sure to do it safe for global warming.
Finally, a solution that you basts to solve our problems.
First of America. Scover of the more.
Al Gore: This is the last one.
Video: Commandment: It's about returing energy at America.
One of the fastest ways of fast to dependence that they kills our planet.
Comparsa: The future, a new energy network of energet.
Comparate is 2: Novi investments for ben retribites.
Comment: Rear America. It's time to be realists.
Al Gore: A old proverbial of African says, "If you want to go to speed by solo.
If you want to go far further."
We have to go far far fast.
Thank you very much.
Last year at TED I did a TED introduction on the LHC.
And I promises to go back to you on how the machine.
So here I am there there -- and for those that time is not her, the LHC is the biggest scientific experiment -- 27 miles of circle.
His compit to reach the conditions that were fewer than a billions of a second from the beginning of the universe -- until 600 million times a second.
And this is just environment.
This is the machine in Ginevation.
We Foth these min-Big in the relevel.
This is what I work. It's called ATLAS -- it's 44 meters and has a 2,000 feet and a 2,000 feet --
This is a spectacular image of ATLAS in building so you can see the proportions.
The 10 secember of the last year we have the machine for the first time.
And this picture was taken by ATLAS.
It was because of a control of control.
It's a picture of the first particles of particles that made all the LHC, and in the collision, deliberately, with a part of the LHC, and spread particles within the relevel.
In other words, when we saw that image the 10 sect secember, we knew that the machine that is a great living.
I don't know if this was doing it to do more than that, when somebody went on Google and saw that the beginning was this in the beginning was this.
That means that we had a cultural impact beyond scientific impact beyond scientific impact beyond the scientific impact beyond scientific impact beyond the scientific impact beyond the scientific impact of the scientific impact impact of the scientific impact of the scientific impact of the scientific impact of the scientific impact beyond the scientific impact beyond the scientific impact of the scientific impact of the scientific impact of the scientific impact of the
About a week, there was a problem with the machine, it was a problem with the machine, this drug files here -- these dors.
These files take 13,000 prints when the machine works at the massive of the power.
Now, the technical between you will look at the files and will say, "It's not true. I'm films.
And instead they can do it because when they're very colding the superconducting files.
So, at least 271 degrees, at least 271 degrees that of the space between the stars, these files can bring that current.
In one of the most of the most of the nine that magneter-fabrication.
So the files are going to read read and 13,000 amps suddenly met a electrical resistanced resistanced resistance.
This was the result.
Now, this is even more impressive if you think that these magnety weight more than 20 tons and that have been moved about 30 centimeters of about 30 centimeters.
They were damaged about 50 magnets.
We had to take them to sheet what we did in it.
We have repristined them and updrugs.
Now, they're going back all of their place underway.
By the end of the LHC is going to be new integroup.
And we accencies that we look at the right data or himself to get the right data or him, and continue so our adventure to find what are the morning is the morning that universe.
Now, of course, in a certain qual quite of the debate on the values of science and science and the engineering. It's easy to confitting it. It's easy to confuting.
I think that the fact that it's so difficult, the fact of going beyond the limits, I think this is the value of things like LHC.
I would like to conclude with the words of a Inglese scientist Ingl, which, image, in defense of useful experiments in his pupill, his pupill, his pupill, his pupill, he said, "No is so dangerous for the progress of human mind as the required as a defet-definitely dought to the provide that there are no mistakes to be no new money, that there are not new money, that we have new money, that are not not new mong to conquenterpriquitorous, conquismitor new mons of conquismitor new mons of conquisisisitititor new mons of conquoter to conquitor new worlds of conquise, and
Thank you.
I want to start asking you to rethink about how to do -- as a child, you plays in the morning.
While you understand how to reach them and grab them, and they can actually get them and to get them to think and solve problems and to get sold problems and to get sold problems and space.
The space is deeply connected to the way we understand the world around us.
So, from the informatal of our interaction with physical objects with physical objects. And my Sator to my Jevan Kalanithi, I started asking ourselves to ask ourselves, and I started asking -- and if we use a computer, instead of having the digital mouse as a digital polrelly that will move on a digital depths that will die.
and we get it to our pleasure please?
And the question was interesting that we decided to explore the answer, building the answer, building Siftable.
In a few words, a Siftable is a big computer interator of a big disk.
In a few words, a Siftable is a big computer interator of a big disk.
You can move with the hand with their hand, they can see their movement and a screen and a wireless radio wireless and a wireless radio wireless radio wireless and a wireless radio wireless --
But especially are physical objects like the morning, you can just move it by making it mistakes.
Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem tools to manipulate information.
And as they become more physicists, you know, the other way of their movement, and as they become more physics, and as they become more physics, and the others, as we die and others, how we can exploring new and different style style still.
I'm going to try to some example.
This Siftable is configured to show of the vide: if you win a direction, the video will rotate this video will rotate like this, if you include it in the other parts from the other side India.
These interactive reports are conscious of other people.
If they grab them in their own thing.
If they come circcle, they can see it and they can again a little bit.
If they come circcle, they can see it and they can again a little bit.
They also have their movement and unclination.
We then realized that one of the interesting interesting implications of the interaction was the community of the data as if it was a liquid.
In this case, we have three Siftable configured as byes and I can use them to versate them to versate the color in that central that where they are missing them.
and I can use them to be using them to versate it to the central to the color of the color in the central that way.
If we are too too much, we can put a little bit of place.
There are also good possibility of learning -- like languages and the logical mathematics and the logical things that people can try to try to do things quickly, and see the results results immediately.
Now I'm --
This is a Fibonacus sequence that I make a equations.
And we have a game of words that is half a between Scarabeo and Bogle.
Morically, at every turns, you get a letter to go to Siftable, Pratically, every turns, you get a letter on every Siftable, and while he looks to each Siftable, and while he has a dictionary.
And then after about 30 seconds remissions, and you have a new set of reading and new possibility.
Thank you.
Here's what children were in the Media Lab, I did in the Media Lab, I did it and I walk a video of it.
They have a lot.
And one of the interesting things of this kind of application is that you don't have to give you a lot of educations.
You just have to say, "Compons of word," and they know exactly what to do.
That's what other people who are trying to do it.
This is our youngest betterwards, there --
It really wanted to be immurse to them.
They were only morning, for him.
Now, this is a application of a interactive cardon.
We wanted to build a tool, to build a tool, learning a device.
It can be to put new characters in the scene, satisfiing their associated associated with Siftable.
It can be to put new characters in the scene, satisfiing their associated associated with Siftable.
So, it's doing the sun of the sun of the sun --
Video: The only is surgend.
David Merrill: Now it has brought a treatment.
Video: The arancient treat.
Bel job.
So let's go to school, Siftable and put close close to the person,
Video: Bau!
-- by inventing the story.
Video: Hi,
DM: It's a story with the open final of open up and it can decide he is.
DM: It's a story with the open final of open up and it can decide he is.
Video: God vill, four.
DM: The last example I have the time to show you is a tool, made recently done for sampling and exeguing music.
It's a tool, made recently, a recently made recently -- to be a music.
Siftable here act sounds like base, base, base, and bacteria.
Every one of these has four different variations, and you can choose what to use.
You can inform these sound sounds in a sequence to your pleasure.
And then you can just make it a sounds," and a "Redan."
These are actually actually that you can control from living as a reversion and filter.
You attack it to a particular sound and then including them in a particular ground.
And then there are the general effects as long and volume, which you apply to the sequence.
Let's look at how it works.
Video: DM: We will try and put a basic in two Siftable "Redan," we put it in a seriously, we extend other low.
I have a byond line of the bottom.
Video: DM: So now I add percent of --
Video: DM: And I'll put the filter to the bacteria, so I can control the effect.
Video: DM: I can fit the whole whole thing that is including time by a side or from the other.
Video: DM: And I'm add my own filter to the bottom to deliver the expression.
Video: DM: I can recombined the sequence "fle."
So I don't have to plan it before, but I can sudden, make it longer or more corn.
And now, finally, I can go to the whole next next to the Siftable to the Siftable "volume."
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is to build new new interfaces more similar as they work as our brain and body.
And today, I had time to show you one of the results of this lost and also some possibilities that we try to bring out the lab out of the lab of the lab of the lab of this lost and I also have some possibilities that we try to bring out the lab out of the lab of this lost and a few possibility that we try to bring out from the lab of this lost of the lab and I have some possibilities that we try to get
The concept that I want to turn to is that it's coming this new generation of objects to interact with digital media in our world in the way we want.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the time of talking to all of you.
I'm a writing.
First books is my profession, but it's more than that, of course, but it's more than that, of course, of the most of the professional --
It's also love and the fall of my life.
And I don't expect that can change.
But I said that something particularly happened in my life and my career, who was in my life and my career that was brought me the whole relationship with this job.
The particular thing is that I was recently written this book, this biography called "Mangia, Prega, the which, so I was very much from my previous precedented in the world and became a big saile, sensational.
And the result is that wherever ever ever gotten from now, people who are treated me as if I was conviction.
Really -- convicted convicted -- convicted it!
They all go from me to all worried and they say, "Do you don't afar any more to do than better.
You don't fear to continue to write all the life without being able to create a book that could be able to do a book that could be to somebody?"
that can care about someone ones?"
It's harmful, you know,
But it could go worse -- to the one of my than 20 years ago, when I started to say to people -- I was a adolescent -- that I wanted to be a writing.
I met to the same reaction based on the fear.
And people would say, "Don't you have successful theme that have success?
Do you fear that the humble kills you kill?
You don't afraid to do this mestior of all the life without that anything is ever out and die of a saming of a saming of a saming infringing with the mestic shake of loving hauls?"
So so it is.
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is, "Yes."
I am afraid of all those things.
I always had fear.
And I also have a lot of other things that people can't supply unneeded to it.
As the algae and other things that are sheep --
But as I was about the writing what I thought and ask me the question of the question I thought about it is be?
Is it rational?
It's logical that anybody to wait to be spleased by a work that you feel about to do it.
But what is there so particular one in the premise creative to make us nervous health to make us about healthy healthy in a way that other charges don't do that?
As my father, for example, he was a chemical engineer and I don't remember one time in his 40 years of activity in his 40 years of activity that he was asked if he was afraid engineer to be engineer it?
It was never -- that block about engineer John, how do it happen?
It didn't work like this, right?
Only, chemicals like group don't have certainly uncertainly in the chair, and the reputation of being alcolummmest.
We writers, we have enough this reputation, and not only writers but creatives of any generally unreputation of any generally, we have this reputation of being enormously instable to be a huge instable,
And it's not another that is looking at the contitude of the magnification of the magnificent death minds of the maggoal young people and often are young people and often for them.
And even those who are not suicide being really disappeared by their women.
Norman Mailer, before in the last interviewed said, "On my book has killed me a little bit of a little bit more extraordinary about the work of their life.
But we don't look at the one when we hear it because we heard these things that so long as we heard these things that we have completely interiorized and accepted the notion is somehow you and art, and the art, to the notion is somehow to the enjoy and art, will always be on the angosh.
And the question I want to bring to all of today,
And it's good for you -- because it also looks at it from a centimeter of distance -- I don't really have to this support for it.
I think it's odious.
And I think it's also dangerous, and I don't want to see the perpetual in the next century.
I think it's better to encourage our great minds to live in.
And certainly I know that in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous, the knowledge of suppositions, especially the circumstances where I are in my career.
Of course, -- I mean, it's pretty young, I have about 40 years.
I have about four decades of work in me.
And it's very likely that anything I write about the world as the work that came out of the world as the work that came out of my last book.
I'm going to be slave, because we're all more or less friends here -- it's probably probably my greatest successful -- it's probably my greatest successful --
Oh, Gesood, what it is.
You know this is the kind of a person to start to be a person to starting to drink in the morning and I don't want to do it.
I would keep doing this work that we do.
So, the question becomes god, what is it?
And so I think, after many reflection -- that the way to work and write is to create a psychological coot cook?
I have to find a few way to find a safety distance between me, and my natural is a natural about which reaction that will be able to get the first year and trying to find some of the best year, patterns about how to do it by looking through time, trying to find other societies to see if they could have the best ideas and more health and more blood health and more blood health and more blood and more health and healthy healthy healthy and more health and healthy healthy distance to get
how to help people creative to help creative inerent risks of creativity.
And that research took me to the Greek and ancient Rome.
See why you go to the circle and then back back.
In the ancient Greek and ancient Rome -- people didn't look at creating that creativity security from men -- OK?
It was thought that creativity was this spirit guard and that they sell to men from a few distant disparts and unknown and unknown and unknown and unknown away.
We call these green devines of the spirits of creativity "demony."
Socry, wonderful creating of having a demon demon that heat off the farmer.
Romans were of the same idea, but they called that kind of spirit without a genius a genius.
which is great, because the Romans didn't think that a genius was really smart.
They thought that a genius was this kind of divine entity that created was literally in the study of a artist, a little bit like the Dobby, and who came out to assisted the Dobby, and who came out to be hidden the work of the artist of that job.
Ecceptional -- -- -- -- that is the distance of psychological that coot that cooks from your job.
And everybody knew that was so that it was so that it was working, right?
So the anti-who were proofed by certain things, like the too narciss; you know, as the too narcis; right?
If your work was exceptional work was not going to take the whole deal of the deal of the incorporea.
If your work fail, it wasn't all of your work fail, right?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be a unable to be a deal.
And so people hang conceived creativity in the Ocdent for a long time.
And then the Researl came and everything change, and it change, and that is the middle of the universe in the middle of the universe across all the mysteries and mystery space to the creatures that write devicity.
This was the principle of the rational humanity-reportional and people started thinking that creativity was completely from the idivid;
And for the first time in history, it started to referred to this or that artist as a genius as a genius to a person with a genius.
And I have to say that I think it was a big mistake.
I think that allows someone to believe a simple person to believe that being a recipe as a recipe as the source and the survival, creative and the survival, creative and eths is a responsibility to a fragile is a very big amount of gipsychology.
It's like to ask somebody to to sun to sun the sun --
Deform and distores completely the ego and creates all these ingestible ings.
And I think it was this pressure to have destroyed the artists in the past 500 years.
And if this is true, and I think that it is, the question becomes up, and it becomes it?
Can we do it differently?
Maybe you go back to a more ancient understanding of the relationship between humans and mystery mystery of creative human report.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we can't cell 500 years of rational thinking about a 18 minutes.
And there is probably people in the audience that he would relief brought scientific suspects on the notion of the notion of the notion of the notion of their projects.
And it's probably not going to convince you all on this thing.
But the question I want to bring is -- why now?
Why don't you think about this this way?
Because it has more sense of any other thing that I've ever heard to explain the exasperants of creative process.
An process that as anybody who ever tried to do something -- therefore, basically, all here -- you don't have rationationally in it.
And in fact, it can sometimes look like completely paranormal.
I did this recently with the Ruth in the Ruth Stone that has now 90 years, but that was a few years old, and he said that in his childhood in the Rurral Virginia, and he was working out in the walls, and he was in the widea, and he was feeling it from the landscape.
He said it was like a fragorous trended.
And that came rotoling to her from the landscape.
And it was going to get it to get it down into his feet.
He knew it was a only thing to do to do at that point and it was like, "current."
And so it was going to go home and it was following from this poetness, and he wouldn't make a piece of paper and a wall of a paper -- and a wall of it -- and it would be collected on the page.
Sometimes he couldn't be done enough quickly, so it was so fast and correcent and reach without getting to the house and the roll was and the roll was and the lost and he was lost and he was going to roll through the landscape, as he said, "another poet."
And then there were times -- this piece I don't forget -- there were moments where it was almost losss; right?
So, he was running at home and he was trying to walk across the card and he was going through a poetry in the while he was passing, and then he was like to walk with the other hand and and the off.
He was offered the poetry from the tail and reput it in his body and the transmitting on the page.
And in these cases, the poetry is going to be presented on the perfect page, but the contrary, the last word for the first word at the first word at the first word at the first word at the first word at the first word at the time.
So when I felt it -- it's crazy, it's exactly the same as a creative process.
I don't have my creative process -- I'm not a conducting conducting --
I'm a mulation, and my way of working is; I was a little bit of working on the same orary every day and sume and work and stand over the sweat it over the enjoy of the work of working.
But even I stand in my head, I stopped against that thing, and I stopped against that thing, at a time.
And I imagine many of you have the hit up.
You know, even though the work and ideas came from a certain source of a certain source of not very much of it.
And what is this thing?
And how can we relate to it in a way we don't do our head, but but what does it make us remain themselves?
I have to look at it, the best contemporary example that I have is the Tom Waits, which I interviewed a few years ago for a newspaper in a day.
We were talking about this, and you know, Tom, for the majority of life has been the incarnation of the artist of the artist of the remainstretched these species of creatives creatives of totally interior interior interior interior interior of the most interior interior interior in the most of life, interior in the most of the life has been talking about this, and you know, and you know, and Tom, and you know, and Tom
But then he will be calculmed and a day while he was driving on a car in Los Angeles, changed everything for him.
He was going to go fast, and everything a melodia, which is a little bit of a melodia, which comes in his head as it does the inspiration, elusive and aletty -- and the wish -- you know, it's wonderful and wish -- you know, it's not how to get it.
It's not a paper -- it has no mathemat, it has no recorder.
So it starts to feel this kind of old anxiuses to grow in him and say, "I'm going to lose and remarrususe.
I'm not good enough and I can't do it."
And instead of going to go in the stopped here.
And then then the whole process of doing something completely new.
And he looked at the sky and said, "she's going to see that I'm driving?"
"Do you look like a song nove?
If you really want to exist, it comes back in a more opport, when I can take care of you.
Others, you go to to try to get somebody else today.
You go to disturbing Leonard Cohen."
And his work process changed after that.
Not the job, it was even dark as a sembly dark of it.
But the process, and the heavy that was released when the genius was released when the genius that came out of the genius that it was caused to be a whole thing behind where it was going to be a whole thing that was not a whole thing that had to be a interior thing that had to be a interior and tormented it.
but it was a wonderful bizard, wonderful bizarre collaboration between Tom and this outside and this outside that he was not Tom.
So how the story I felt how to change a little bit the way I was working and already save me a time.
This idea, I was saving me when I was writing "Mangia, Prega, and fall of the disperation that we all when we work on something and we all when we work on something and we can't think that it will be a desaster ever writing that will be the worst book -- that that the worst ever written it out.
Not just bad at the worst book book write.
And I started thinking about throwing this project.
But then I remember Tom who talked about the air and provaway.
So I went up my face from the manuface, and I would say my comments at a vacuum empty of the room.
And I said to you, "Lay, whatever, you know, both of this book is not going to be brilliant not going to be very she'll be very sheat myself?
Because as you see that I'm putting us everything I haven't going to be doing that.
So if you want to be better you have to introduce and do your parts.
Okay. But if you don't do it all knows, I don't do it at all.
I'm going to go to write the same because it's my work.
And I would like to favor that was recorded that I was to do my own particularly -- it is at the end of North Africa in the deserts of North Africa people who were in the deserts for the dances of the dances of the dances and the walk to the walk and the neighbors that were going to the walk and hours to the walk to the albe.
And they were always magnificent because the dances were professionals, and they were fantastic.
But every who, and a lot of these artists became actually transmitted in transmitting in actually transmitting it.
And I know what I talk, because I know that you have seen it all over a certain point, a loss of a point.
It was like the time stopping and the dances walks through a kind of portal and he was not doing anything that was doing nothing differentles, but everything is about 1,000 notes, but everything is going on.
And suddenly unappeared not just like a human being.
But it turns out from divince and under the devicity of divinity.
And when this next few years -- the themselves, people knew what it was, they called him with his name.
They used their hands and they started singing, "Allah, Allah, God God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God.
That's God, you know,
Curious note -- when the Morder, the Spain Spain of Spain and the Spainter and the footprinted in the century of "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Alla
In Spaint, when a artist has done something impossible and magic -- "Hey, oh, magnific, s," unclear, uncompreprectured -- a God.
And it's great, because we needed it.
But the problem comes the next day, for the ballery -- for the ballery itself, and discovers that are the 11 in the morning of the Martedday and last God is not more.
It's just a mortal with a big death. And maybe it will never be able to each other.
And maybe nobody will be going to be the name of God still as the yet, and what does it have to do with the rest of his life?
It's difficult.
This is one of the most painful reciliations to do in a creative life.
But perhaps not have to be so angoshing if you can not believe it, but for the most extraordinary of your being being being being from you to stessi.
But it creates that you just have come from a un-re-based imaginable of this team of your life that you have to go to somebody else when you have.
And you know, if we think of this is all change.
And so I started thinking about it, and it's certainly as I thought for several months during the work of the book that I will prestore the dangerous, the dangerous, and I was very success.
And what I have to keep telling me when I feel electrized by this is, not having fear.
Let me just just your job. It just just your job.
It is going to presenting for your part, any of your side, any of it.
If your work is dance.
If the divine, I assigned with a little bit of leaving and leave some kind of wonderful -- for a few of wonderful for a time through your efs, then "Oka!"
Of course, you do the same as your dance.
And "Oh, you know, you know, you can do it.
I think I think we have to teach it.
"Yes!" to yourself, even for the human and tests and tests on the switch and tests to delive.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
As you know I've talked about some of these projects on human genome -- about what it can mean, and what it can mean:
We're going to now start a new percorrecent biology and now starting from that digital code and now from that digital code we are entering a new fashion of biology, designing and sympting life.
We always tried to make big questions.
"What is the life?" is something that many biologists I think they have trying to figure out how many levels.
We tried a different approach, reducing the minimes.
We're tyalizing for almost 20 years ormas.
When we sequenced the human genome was treated to past from the analogy world of the digital world of the computer.
Now we ask our: can we regenerate life, or create new life from this digital universe from this digital universe?
This is the map of a small organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, which is the species from the smallest genome between those that can authored in the lab --
And we tried to reduce the genome to create a more smaller than that.
We are able to eliminate a hundred genes of the genes of about 500 that are here.
But when we take a check to his metabolic map is relatively simple than the noway to the noway to the noway to the noway to the noway to the noway to the noway to the noway to the noway to the noway to the noway to the noway to the noway to the noway to the noway to the noway
In the same time, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate each time, it's very unlikely that this can bring a living cell.
So we decided that the only way to progression was to synthesize this so that we could make the component the components to bring the components to bring some of these fundamental questions.
And so we started the adventure of the "Can we can synthesize a chromoso?"
Can you make the chemistry to produce these great molecules that we have never been able to create before I hold one?
And in a deal of it, can we make a function?
A chromosome, it's just a piece of chemical material chemical material.
The speed we can type the life is growing exponential refashion report.
Our capacity to write the genetic code, ages rather slowly, but it's better.
And our most recent results take a exponential curve.
We started over 15 years ago.
The process has require many passages, starting with a biothic review before we started the first experiments.
But we found that it is very difficult.
There are tens of thousands of cars in the world that produce little DNA, the 30 to 50 to 50 letters and it's a degenerative proces: the most segment is longer than the segment is longer than the segment is longer longer is a degeneral with it.
So we had to develop a new method, to assemble these frames and reach the mistakes.
And this was our first attempt to go from digital information from Phi X174.
It's a little virus that kills bacteria.
We designed the framments, effectively the reeffort and getting a molecules of DNA of about 5,000 letter of DNA of about 5,000 letter letter of about 5,000 letter letter of DNA of about 5,000 letter to a molecule of the DNA of about 5,000 letter of the DNA of about 5,000 letter of the DNA of about
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemical material chemical materials, and we put it into the bacteria and we put it into this bacteria and to produce particles.
The virals have been released by cells, they went back and they have destroyed the E.
I talked about recent members of the petrolift industry said that they have certainly understood this model.
They recipe of you.
We believe that this is a situation where the software really building his own hardware in a biological system.
But we wanted to do things in larger things.
We wanted to build the entire chromosome.
It's about 580 mile beats of genetic code.
So we thought of building it in the bottom, the size of virus, so that we can change the checks to understand what the components of a living cell.
The design is crucial and if we start with digital information, these must be very accurate information, these must be very accurate it.
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995, the standard accuration was a Twenter for every 10 thousand and the basis.
We discovered resequencing that we had 30 mistakes. If we had that original sequence we never had to be able to do it work.
One part of the process is to design segment, a lot of the 50s that are overwhelming with all the other segments of the segment of the smaller to build underunitable underground underground and build together.
Let's try to be one of the one here.
You probably have the bed that we put us of the flight.
Think of this -- we have a genetic code based on four letter: A, C, G.
Three of those readers and they put about 20 adminihats, and there's a specific order to reading for every love for every aminative love for every aminacid of beat.
So we can use the genetic code to write word, fraxiety to write word,
What we did at the beginning was authographing.
Some of them were dolphuses from the fact that it was not poetry.
We designed these sat these sat to just unize with a fundamental one.
There are enzymes that repair them and asyme.
And we started assembling from the six, starting with five to seven miletter from five to seven miletter to 24 thousand letters in a mile letter to 24 mile letter to 72 thousand letter to 72 miletter to 72 letter letter to 72 letter letter to 72 letter to seven miletter to a little
And we have done these sets in the abundance that we have done these sitting so that we're trying to create a very robate proception -- as you will see in a minute.
We're trying to automatize the process.
So, this seems like the tabellon a basketch.
When we get to these very long, more than 100 mile segments, more than 100 mile in E.
You get to the modern tools of the modern molecular biology
So we looked at some other mechanisms.
We knew another mechanism called a homology, called a homology recombination of homology, to repair the DNA to repair the DNA to unize the DNA to unize the chance.
Here's an example.
This organism, called Deinococcus radioving three million rad of radiation.
You can see in the upper square the distructured as its chromosome.
In 12 hours is reassembled exactly how it was before.
And there are thousands of organisms that have been able to do it.
These organisms can be able to be able to be completely sweat at it.
They can live under empty.
I'm absolutely sure life exists in space, and you move to find new rich environments to find new rich environments.
ASA shown is the NASA showed that this happen.
This is a picture of the molecule that we've built using these processes -- just using the design of the design of the savailable of inserious saving.
The liver, I assemble them assembly reside.
This image was not taken with a electronic microscope -- but with a regular microscope with a regular microscope --
It's a molecule so big that we can see it with a little slightly slightly slightly lightly.
These are pictures that they cover a period of about six seconds.
This is the publishing we did a little bit of a long time.
It's about 580,000 letters of genetic code.
It's the largest of a definitely molecules that ever created by the man.
It has a lot of 300 million.
If we spent it with a 10 paper without space, and they would like 142 pages to turn this this genetic code.
Now, how do we work work? How do we active it?
Of course, you get a virus is a guy from a guy who are a guy --
It's a little bit more complicated when you use bacteria.
It's simpler even when it's cells as a our-way cells -- you can just extreme the nucleus and inserirl one other, which is basically the process of cloneleless the process of cloning.
In the archaaea is integrated within the cell of the cell but we have recently demonstrated that we have to do a complete train of a chromosome, e,
We purified a partnership from a microbial special special special species.
The two are different as men from the topis.
And we added some genes in the way that we can decide what to chromosoon.
And then it has the blood with the enzymes so that they kills all the proteins.
And when we put it in the cell was stupending -- and you open our graphy sophisticatos -- the new chromosome, the new chromosome,
And we really thought we couldn't go that three, but we could still get it over there.
This is one of the greatest mechanisms of evolution.
We found that a lot of species have added a second or a third of a third of some parts, added in a thousands of new tracks to that species.
So who think about evolution as a gene gene to evolution that has not understood most of biology.
And there are enzymes called the restripption of restripes are that adrirights the DNA.
The chromosomes that was in the cell of the cell of it.
The cellph-the cell that we put inserito's ha.
And it's expressed, and he recognized the other way as a eastern material as a material material material.
It became blue because of the genes that we have insert.
And in a short of time, all the characteristics of a species have gone lost went lost and then it turned out all in a new software that we put in the cell.
All the proteins have changed, membranes have changed, and when we read the genetic code is exactly what we have transfed to you.
Now, this could look like genetic alchemy, but by altering DNA software can change things in a pretty substantial.
Now, I explained that that here is not about genes: but progress from three million and a half million and a half million evolution, and I said that maybe we're going to create a new version of Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosion process.
Why do I do that?
I think it's obvious enough when we think of our needs.
We're going to spend six and a half billion people at nine in the next 40 years.
Just to give you an example: I was born in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for each one existing in 1946; 40 years, there will be four of them will be four of them.
We're going to find it problems now to find food, water and clean medicinal and dance, medicinalt for six and a half billion people.
It's going to be harder more hardly than doing it for nine billion.
We use more than five billion carbon boils over 30 billion bundaries.
That means a million barrels a day.
When we try to find biological processes or whatever kind of a process to replace them, it's a huge challenge.
We have to keep the whole of the CO2 from these materials that ends up in the atmosphere.
On the day, because of the scientific discoveries of the world discoveries in the world, we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I like to think that are designed for the future.
The electronic industry has only a dozen dozen about component and think about how many different things have come out of them.
Our limits here are principles by the reality and our imagination.
We now have techniques of techniques of sympts, as quickly as we call a combinatory combinator.
We can build a big robot that can produce a million robots a day.
Think of process, these 20 million genes or to prove the processes to produce the process to produce either either or pharmacs, we can change, by a little team, and to create more biology now that we can now change, by a little team, and to create more than the science.
And it's just a standard.
We can choose for chance of survival, production or carbon vaccines ethc.
This is a few software programs of some software programmed that we're working on to be able to sign us and design species to the computer.
Well, we don't need to necessarily how they will be year.
We know exactly what their genetic code.
We're now focusing on fourth generation.
You also saw you see that you are ethanol from the grand it was a male experiment finish experiment in it.
We have carbon depending on the third generation of the higher generation of the higher carbon than the opty or different kinds of sits as the either either of the types or different kinds of throw or different kinds of sits as the either of the higher generation as the either of the higher generation of the higher generation as the either and the higher generation of the higher as the higher generation of the higher and the higher generation of the higher generation of the value of the wavailable as the high.
But the only way biology can have a great impact without increasing impact without increasing the cost of food and limiting the dishift of food and to reach the CO2 in material -- to us work to design cells that can reach this purpose, and we can have the first carbon dion fourth generation in about 18 months.
The sunlight combined with the CO2 is a methodo; in our discoveries around the world, we found different methods.
This is a organism that we described in 1996.
It lives in the deep ocean to about 2,500 feet to the eboiling of water.
It creates meter from the CO2 molecular hydrogen molecular as energy source as a source of energy.
We're trying to understand if we can get the CO2 to the CO2 to the CO2 tubes, converts that CO2 in carbon in carbon to drive this process.
So short we think that we could be able to increase what the question of basic question that the basic question of what the life."
Ely? If you can't do it from TED, where can you do that?
It would say a main of energy source.
And we are working on the same methods to create the same methods to create the instantanei.
You've seen this year with the influence, we're always behind a year and a dollar, and with a dollar, at least when it's to find the right right now.
And I think that it can change by combining anticips.
That's how the future could start to look like change, now, the tree of evolution, accelerating evolution with bacteria and the ultimate cells.
We're so much as we get people to improve people.
Our purpose is to do a lot of living enough to try to do it. Thank you very much.
First of all I'm going to show you -- the fastest possible question, some fundamental job, and the new technology that we've brought to Microsoft in a very quickly. This is Seadragon.
It's a environment, which you can interact is a local level that remote with a huge amount of visual data --
We're seeing a lot of gigabytes of digital photos, with a kind of a continuous cost, for a very quickly speed by a bread of bread -- and availing the images as we want.
And it doesn't matter how big the amount of information that we see the amount of information that we see, how big these data or images.
Most of them are typical photographs, but this is a scanning scanning from Congresss-to-Congressss and rewalk into the 300 megapixel.
It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that it limits predictions of a system like this is the number of pixels on your screen in any time. It's also a very flexible architecture.
This is a whole thing -- example of this is not imagined.
This is the Dickens. Every colony is a chap.
To share you to show you that it's just a test, and not imagining to do something like this, to see that it is a real representation of a representation of the test, not a picture.
It could be a little artificial to read a little artificial book to read a electronic book book book for a electronic book.
I don't recommend.
This is a more realistic example. It's a number of the Guardian.
Every image is the beginning of a section.
And it really gives you the pleasure experience of reading the cardboy version of a magazine version of a five-nature version of a meeting.
We also did something with the cornx of this particular number of the U.S. Look at the Guardian.
We created a publicity flows -- much higher than the one that you use in a normal commercial adverververtising -- and we put you in the trade.
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile, you can see here.
Or other models, or even specific specific techniques.
And this really demonstrates some of these ideas to heliminate the space of the screen.
We hope that this lady to put a few pop-up and some other door to other popcheries -- not to be necessary.
Of course, the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology.
And I don't want to lose time, if we don't say that we have contributed to the field.
These are all the streets in the United States overwhelming a geospace of NASA ASA
So now we go to something else.
This is actually from the live on the web; you can go to the webs; you can see it on it.
It's a project called Photosynth, which fight two different technologies.
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual computer to be very interesting to the Noah Snavely, a student of the University of Washington, with the help of Steve Seitz UW, and Research.
And it's from the alive on the web, and the Seadragon.
You can see it when we do this kind of screen, where we can go from a picture of the other and have this kind of experience to the other thing to be in the multiple resolution is going to be a multiple of the image.
But the space collocasting images here has actually a meaning.
The visualization of computers have recorded these images together, so that they correspond to the real places. And so that the real places. All of all the neighbors -- all the neighbors in the Roccious Montagne Roccious area, you see the elements of a slides, stable de-stable elements and that are all connected to space.
I don't know if I have time to show you some environment.
There are a lot of spacecraft --
I want to go directly to one of the Noah-- and this is from a previous prototype of Photosynth that we did work for the first time last summer -- to show you what I think is really the key thing that I think is really the key key behind this technology, Photosyth. And it's not necessarily much evident to the environments that we've put in the website --
We had to worry about the legal aspects and so forth.
This is a reconstruction of Notre Dame images were prevention from Flickr. Basta Flickr in Flickr and you get images of the camps, and you get images of the camps, and you get images of the around. Every one of these around.
So they're all images from Flickr and were all connected to spacecraft in this way.
And it's possible to be to navigate in this very simple.
You know, I never thought of finish to work for Microsoft.
It's very gratify to get this kind of a collection here.
I think you can see that it's a lot of different types of types -- from the those of the SLR, a a significant number of these are in this environment.
And if I can try to try to find those more stranother.
Many are blocked by factors, etc.
Some part here is a set of photography -- there it is a series of photography -- -- there it is.
This is a Notrecile Dame record.
We can go from the physics of this environment.
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment. This is now taking data from everytires -- from the whole memory of how the earth, from a visual memory of how the earth, from a visual point of view, and connects all of these data together.
All those photos become connected together, greater than the parts.
You have a model of the earth of the earth of the earth emergence.
Think about this as a promotion of Stephen Lawler on Earth virtual Earth Earth virtual virtual Earth --
It's something that growth in complexity as people are using it, and the people who are useful to increase with use.
Their photos are branches with other people.
If you have the idea of contrast all these sants says, my name, my photographs of Notre Dame sudral of Notre Dame suddenly arries all of those data, and I can use it as a point of the spot, in that metapal to the space, in that metapal and have a experience of anybody else and have a social experience of a type of type from the sea and have a social experience of some of these data, and have a buncross-shelter and cutting experience of these of these of these of the muscle.
Of course, a consequence of all of this are very highly elaborated virtual processed virtual processed virtual part of the earth and satellow images and satellow images and satellow images and satellow images and satellow images of all of the interesting place.
Mille thank you.
Chris Anderson: I realized good? What your software will give us to do is that at a point, in the next few years, all the interact photographs of all the world or will be connected together?
BAA: Yeah. What it's doing is basically discovered.
It's creating hyperlink, if you want to be empty between images.
And it's doing it in the bottom of images.
And it becomes very interesting if you think about wealth of the simple, of the whole of the images of these images are being able to be injured in it.
As a research of images on the Web, you have a sentence and the text on the Web page, and the page on the picture.
Now, what if that picture is going to connect all your picture?
So the amount of the semant interconnection and the amount of wealth that is really enormous about it is really enormous for the networks. It's a classical effect.
CA: Blaise, it's really incredible.
BAA: Thank you very much.
One of the primary of the primary of the honding of the inner research is the way that you can live between who not forget the old of the old traditions, in the wind, the walls in the wind, the genter in the wind, the genter in the wind, and loving the plants.
You know, the way the monkeeps the Samans still over the Vy Lattea, or that the elders of old Inuit are still colored by meaning -- or that in Himalaya, the budy of the Dharm of the Dharma of the Dharm of the Sorropologia, and that the idea that the world in which the world we live in absolutely but it's just a model of reality, but it's just a model of reality,
the following of a particular set of choices adaptations that our stirpe has done -- good or a lot of generations.
And of course, we all share of the essential tracts.
We all hidden of it.
We are subjects to get reward.
We need to deal with the death, so we don't surprise and balance,
We all have a art of art.
What it is the particular rhythm of any culture.
Not matter that they are the Penan forests of Borneo, or the Haiti, or the Haiti, or the Haiti, or the desert in Sepentrierrierial of the Sepentries of the Wat, or a camellier in the heart of the Saa.
He was my companing companing in the desert a month ago, or a month ago, or a walls of Mt. Everest, the mother desert on Mt. Everest, the mother of the world.
All of these populations teaching us that there are other ways of thinking about it, other ways of moving in the world.
And if you think a minute, it's a concept that it can give you hope for you.
Inside, the cultures of the world creating a spiritual and cultural life that has a spiritual and cultural that has important for the well-being of the planet as a biosphishing as biosphishing as biosphony.
And you can think about this the cultural ragnation as a ethnosphery and you can define the ethnos' of all the concepts, dream of all the concepts, mythium, inspirations, intuitions that are being from the human imagination from the human imagination of the consciousness of consciously.
Ethnospher's greatest pathrimony.
It's the symbolic of what we are and what we can be as as as as a kind of quisitives.
And because biosphere was quite quite consumed as much as it happened to the ethnos;
No biologist, for example, it would say that 50 percent of all the species was or the eastern orate because it's just fail, or -- in the ultimtimate field -- in the field of biological diversity -- and you don't have neighborhool hypoths -- that the cultural diversity of it.
The indicate of that is, of course, the language of language.
When you're born 6,000 languages on this planet.
One language is not a kind of a vocabulary or from a series of grammeric rules.
One is the kind of a human spirit of the human spirit is the pushe.
It's the medium of which animation of every culture comes in the material.
Every language is a forest of mind, a swood, a spiritual ecosystem of spiritual possibilities.
And of those 6,000 languages, as we sitting here in Monterey, at least half the time is not more ssurrying in the ears of the children's ears.
They don't get to teacher, the kids, the meaning means to less than anything, which is already dead.
What is that more sad of the sad of silence, the last talk to a language, of being the last talking about a language, of not how to transmit the shift of admitted or to anticipate the promise of children?
This is a little bit of a few weeks of the world every two weeks -- every two weeks a laughter and brings with themselves and door and a language with a language --
And I know somebody to say "Is that not that better like this?
The world would not be a better place if we all talk about the same language all the same language as we all talk about yoruba. We talk about a cantones:
We talk about kogis.
You will be a track, which means not to talk about their language.
I like to like to make you a journey through the ethnos' ethnos' --
a little journey in the ethnosphery to give you a ash of what we're lost it.
Many of us forget that when I say, "different ways of existing existing really different ways of existing existing things.
Let's take for example, this Barasana, in Sentriony, the popular Sentrional popular the anacony, which creates the mit of the lymer in the sandwim of the South the sacric sacride.
It's a population that is not able to distinguish the blue color, because the celests is identified in the forest, which is identified in the forest, which depends the population.
They have a strange language and a matrimonial rule, called "Heogamics exogamics -- you have to marry a different language.
And this has roots in the mitological famous parts is that in these extese families where you talk about six or seven languages are not a language of a language.
They just listen to and then they start talking about.
We take one of the most interesting tribes with which I lived -- the Waorani Ecuador of the Ecuador noral, an incredible popular popular that has had the first contact in 1958.
In 1957 to five missionaries have tried to committing,
They took it from the very very high photography that they would rely reported them in the pluvial forest, forget that this population of the pluvial forest, had never seen big.
They collected the pictures from the ground, they were research for a shape or a shape and not find nowhere, they wimmed that it was the diavolus, and they killed the five missionaries with the les.
But the Waorani don't kill the stranimal to the stranimal her.
They killed among them.
54 percent of the death was caused by their themselves.
We are recipe to eight generations and we found two of natural death and when we put it for saper, they lost that one of them was aged that one of them was so that it has died again in the same way. And then they killed it myself. And every one of the incredible knowledge of incredible forest.
The hunters were able to recognize the animal 40 steps and recognize the species.
In the first '80s, I was assigned a really interesting compit when my professor of the Harvard asked me if I wanted to go to Haiti to injured to Haiti to to injured society and Tonton Macoutes, and the Tonton Macoutes, and the Tonton Macoutes, and they were sessentially refed to use the shombis.
To make sense of the miraculous to understand the Voodoo culture and the Voodoo is not magic of nera.
It's pretty a lot of a complex vision of the world.
Very interesting.
If I ask you to ask the great religions of the world, what would I say to me?
Christiance; Islam, Gddismo, etc.
A continent is always leaving out out of the sub-Saharan Africa has no religious faiths. And instead of the Voodoo is that the distilled of these religious religious concepts, of these very profound religious religious of slavery of slavery of slavery of slavery has been left in the slavery of slavery has no other than the distilled of these very dedeep nate in the ground tragging tragic.
What makes it interesting is that it makes voodoo it is the intent relationship between life and death.
So the way the spirits.
The spirits can be invocated by the Grande Aqua, respond to the dance of the dance and they replaced themselves, and they replaced themselves the way for a short active active follower the follower will be the dio.
So this is why you go to a white of them to say, "You want you to go to a God.
We give it in the temple and we become God."
And from the moment that you are poss; it's the spirit that drive, how can you make you mal?
So you see these incredible events -- I followed voodoo in the state of tracking that they are unfairly infugees that are very strong the mind in the body when it catalyzed in a state of the mind when it catalyzed in a state of extreme of the extreme exciting.
And over all the populations that I lived the most extraordinary Kogi Santa Marky Santa Marky in the Colombia Market Colombia secentrional of the Santa March of the Santa March of the Santa March in the Colombia Santa Marcky Colombia on the most extraordinary in the most extraordinary of the most extraordinary in the most extraordinary Santa Marcent Colombia.
It turns out that we have a tyrance that once they lived on the careubial floors that the Colombia in the attesa conquist, the population of the carbely.
In a macky continent of blood, this population has never been conquited by the shagnowles.
On the whole today are governed by a cler but their education is very extraordinary.
The young followers are taken by the family to three or four years and they live in a world of good and shake in a world of good and shake in the bottom of the ice for 18 years.
Two years of a nine years of proposited to reproduce the nine months of management that spend in the user's mother, now are metaphorically in the uter's the utery of the Great and Madre.
For this time, they accultured to the values of their society, values that they previous their pray and only their prayers are previous equilibrium -- or to say the ecologic equilibrium -- or to say the ecologic equilibrium of the ecological equilibrium -- or to say the ecologic equilibrium -- or to say the ecologic equilibrium -- or to say the cosmic equilibribrium -- or to say -- or to say the values of the values of the values of their society of their societies.
And at the end of this incredible beginning, they have been suddenly bed out and for the first time in life, and the first time in the age of the first of the first be. And in that actist of the first balls -- when the sun is a stick in the talk. The prevention of the beautiful beauty is conferated in the whole of his talk. The premit of the send. The pre-sident. The pre-side,
"Vist? Proprior how I said to you.
It's stupend. It's now to protect it."
It's called the greatest brothers and say that we us, the minors, the colpeful brothers of the world.
This level of intuition is extremely important.
When we think about Indian populations and the environment, we invote Rousseau and the old story of the wildlife of the wildlife in his simplicity or maybe we invote Thord Thord and say that these popules are close to the Earth of us.
The indegenes are not feeling or unhappy from our nostalgic of our days.
There's no space for these things in malaric palural stages or in the geons -- but because of the time and the ritual and the ritual of Earth is not about the concept of being conscious conscious conscious of being conscious consciousness -- the concept that the Earth can live only because it's infuse of human consciousness can only live because it's about human consciousness --
What does that mean?
That means that a guy of the And And who grows up creating that mountain is a pineating that will be a human being being being a deeper and will have a very different report. And it will have a very different relationship with the mountain or that place of a Montana growing that grow is a mountain of a Montana growing mass of rock rock of rock rock rock rock that being box.
which is the dimoral of a spirit or a mineral is irrieving.
What is interesting is the metaphors that defines the relationship between individual and the natural world.
I grew up in the forests of the Britann's forests that the forests eventually had to be cut cut.
That has recipe to me a human beings from my friends who believe that the forests are the death of Hukukukuk's beyond the beat the same time that the nice and the channibal spirits that live on the world -- the spirits that they deal with in the Hatsa.
If you start to look at that these cultures can actually create different reality, you can start to understand some of their discovery sensitive discoveries.
I took this picture of the nordoctorking.
Maybe some of you heard about the ayahuase, the most powerful repertoiday's repertoium.
What makes it fascinating the ayahuass is not the potential for the support, but his elaboration. It's made by two elements.
From a lian lean-cook that has a series of beta-carboline, harmine and harminds;
And by making the only plant plant of a coffee that will alters a little bit of the consciousness, but it's measured with the leaves of a coffee family, and he was in the cofferads.
This plants that triptamines, very similar to the night -- a methoyptamine-5, methoxyptamine-5, methoxyptamines.
If you ever see the Yanomami tyrare on for the nose of the replace, which is a different set of species, anches that are methoxydimethoxydimethoxyptamines.
Tiring that polar on the nose is a little bit like being disappeared by a smoker and landing on a board of electricity.
I was often God, with my professor, Richard Evan Shultes, the man who dropped the psychoppsychoppsychopen, with his discoverishelter of the labinog in the '30 in Mexico.
Second I don't have to be classify these triptaminoyxes because if you're done not telling any of being hallucined.
It's possible to assume just if you put other substitting with other chemicals, which denial MAO.
Now it's the beautiful beta-carbols that are inbady in this liana is inbating, the same kind of need to potentiate triptamines. The question of that is a 80,000 species of plants, how these people are they going to be two deaths in two deathologically don't million, but if you combine in this way, believe a biochemical version that it is dangerous for the several of the part?
We use the great euphemism of proof the proof the proof error, that can revealing infrutting.
But if we ask India, they will say, "Paking us to talk."
What does that mean?
This tribes -- the Copan, has 17 variety of ayahuas's hot, and that at our eyes would go into the same species.
If they ask him how they were their pocksons will tell us how they were thinking, "Three of the rest I don't know any?" I said, "No."
The solution is, you take the 17 variety in a night of the pion the full and each will be a different different of it.
With this not a Harvard, but it's much more interesting than to count the stams.
Now, the problem is that also is that the problem is that even the ones of us who have heart people who are painting them in the history of our real world of history of our real world and pass it in the real world of the real world and past to the margage in the real world -- and past it is.
In fact, the XX-century, 300 years, not will reminded for his wars or its technology, but rather like the thing that we were stopped and we embracing them actively or accepted the destruction of the planet. Now the problem of the planet. Now the problem is not the change.
All cultures through the century have been involved in a dance for new possibility of life.
And the problem is not technology.
Indians have no Sioux have no to be Sioux when they put them on the ark and fresh as Americans have no fresh of being Americans when they put them off the horse and calyxiety and calymme.
It's not the change or technology that threats the ethnos' integrity of ethnos; it's the power.
The domination.
And if you look at the world, you will find that these are not destined to disappear to disappear.
They are living and dynamics and dynamics out of the hydical forces that are beyond their ability to adaptament.
Whether that is disbodishing in the pathric of Penan:
a noble nofilled in the Sarawak, in the Saraside, a population that has lived in the forest, and now reduced to a generation on the reference of the reference in the reference of the refer, where you can see the rivers in the middle of the Cinese Meria, where the Japanese Meria, where the Japanese Meria, where the giaponal, the giapones, the Japaniter's death --
ready to reach the stock with the lawyer to the forest.
Or, in the case of Yanomami, are the diseases that have come with the discoveries.
If we move on on on the Tibet, where I'm doing many research, you'll see the hardly of the political domination.
As you know the genocide -- the physical extinction of a popular popular popular level, but the destruction of a popular popular style of a popular popular popular popular popular environment, not convicted -- but celebrated in certain environment, because it makes part of the pushes of development.
And you can't understand the suffering of the Tibet until you start to the beginning.
I have the 6,000 miles from Chengdu in China in China through the West through the Tibet sudoriental with a young colleague, but only came to Lhasa young line, but only came to Lhasa few of the statistics that we hear about talk.
6,000 monuments, you know, you have a cands.
1.2 million people killed by military in the Cultural.
The father of this guy was ascrited to Panchen Lama.
which means that it was killed at the time of Chinese invasion of Chinese invasion that it was killed at the time of Chinese invasion of Chinese invasion that it was killed at the Chinese invasion that it was killed in the Chinese invasion that it was killed in the Chinese invasion that it was killed in the time of the Chinese invasion of the Chinese invasion of the Chinese invadesion.
Her uncle is smoke with Santity during the diaspora that has brought the population in Nepal.
Her mother was imprisoned and his mother was to be recipe rich.
It was brought to birth in the age of two years from the age of two years from his gonna because he couldn't have live without him.
The sister, which has done the same, was mess camp in reeduity.
One day he had been calculated a fasraffold, and a fashion and this transgress; it was put in the work of seven years.
The Tibet can be unexpedeeth, but the require the reef, the require of the population is from keeping present.
And then it turns out that everything is a choices.
Can we live in the world of the monoony world or we want to get the policyromatal world of diversity?
The great antiboard Margaret Mead, before we die said that his greatest fear of the world, not only one day in our world of this world, not just see the whole legal of the world -- not just we see the whole game, of human imagination is a degree of thought, but a day we wake up from a dimention of a dimentic sleeping that they were other possibilities.
And it's humble to remember that our species is existed for 600,000 years.
The Neoliter's Revolution that has given us to the agriculture, which has done to deal with the seed-grade culture, replacing the proof the classroom with the prope of the specialization, and we talk about 10,000 years ago.
The modern world industrialized in the world of a 300 years.
That sharks the story I don't suggests that we have the answers to all the challenges that we have to deal with in the millennia.
When these cultures of the world is asked what it means to be humans, they respond to to be humans, they respond to 10,000 different voices.
And it's in these answers that we all all required the possibility of being what we are.
I took this whole north of the northern Ethin the Syond island in the Inuit and this man -- and this man -- and this man -- and this man -- and this man -- and this man was telling me the wonderful story of his grandfather's grandfail.
The canadese is not always gentlemen with the Inuit and in the '50s to be our depths in colonies.
The grandfather of this man refused to go there.
And family, temping for his life, he took all the arms, and all of his attempts it.
You have to know that the Inuit don't teme the free, they exploited.
The slymes were made of the origin were made of heaved in the hair.
The grandfather of this man didn't do by arty, and the bits night or the bits that was suffering from the arty of the man that was not snarty of the man who was not snarty of this man has no one of this man who was not done by the night or of this man has not been put in the arty of this man has not done by by by the articket or the baths.

We want to talk about horse with nest? [Risat] And this, in different ways, [Applausi] is the symboll of the Inuit and all the India's population and all the India's population of the world.
In the 1999, 1999 government canadese has redded to Inuit the whole larger territory of the larger territorial of the larger of the California and Texas mand put together.
It's their new pathria. It's called Nunavut.
It's a independent territorial. They Controll all the mineral resources.
One of the splendic example of how a nation-state can reconcise with his people.
And finally, I think it's pretty obvious about who who we have been in these remote area, I realize that they are not at the remote that are not removed.
For someone is home.
They represents of the human imagination that they get to the temples. And for us all of these children, as the dreams of our children's children's children's housness is part of the hope of our children, become part of the hope.
First, we National Geographic we are convince that political will never come to anything.
We believe that polemicy --
[Apausious is not persuasive, but we believe that stories can change the world, and maybe we're the best institutionation to tell the stories of the world. Every month our website.

where the wisdom of all the populations can contributing to our collective benefit.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some of the things that I wrote in this book that I hope that you already heard and try to evidence some connections, in case you don't notice that we don't notice them.
And I want to start with what I call the offices.
The dogma office?
The dogma offices of all the West dogmain of Western industrial society. "If we want to be to be the benefits of the city." "The way to do is to be wealthy individual."
The reason is a side, by a side, in fact that freedom is in itself a value, it's preted, as a valuable for humans.
Do's other is that if we are free, each of us can account to do everything that mass our benefit -- not not that decide in the name of ourselves.
The way to massive freedom is massimilar to be massizing choice.
More choices people are more are free, and greater is freedom, and greater is their benefit to be healthy.
This is a remarkable deeply rooted in society that nobody would be dream to put it in the society that nobody would be dream to put it in the society that nobody would be dream.
And it's also deeply rooted in our lives.
I'm going to show you some examples of what progress has recipe as well.
This is my supermarket. It's not particularly big.
I lost a simple note on conditional conditional conditional conditions.
In my supermarket there are 175 conditions, without context the 10 variety of extravive and the 12 balloon and the 12 whales that you can buy you a huge number of conditional conditional bodiment that nobody of your 175 reads of your own 75 reads is of your degrade of your own 75 reads of your own own several olive and the 12 of your balloon and the balance of your les;
That's what the supermarket.
And then you go to the electronic shopping a stere: CD, radio, reader, radio, plast, radio, plast, the legal bit.
And in this single store, there is a big number of audience.
We can do six million and a half million different combinations using the components that there are in one negoties.
You have to admit that there is a lot of choices.
Other of the world of communications.
One time, when I was a child, they could get all the phones, and the phony phones, that they were providing mothers,
He was known the phone -- you don't buy it.
One of the following of that, in the way, was that the phone is that the phone is not a make.
These days.
We now have a variety of telephone of the phones, especially between cellular cells.
Here's the future.
My favorite is that in the middle of MPP3, cut cuts of the nose and fort for the crasy crasy myself.
If you don't have seen it in the store under the house, you're drinkler bed, you're very good to get there.
And what happens is that people in the goals and this question and this question and this question and the question and this question and the answer is "No."
It's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn't do too many things.
So, in other aspects of life that are much more important than the waters -- it means the same explosion of choices.
Assistance. It's not going on on on the United States that you go from the doctors and the doctors what you have to do.
Instead, you go to doctor, and the doctor, and the doctor, "B" "A has these benefits and these answers to these answers and these risks.
You say, "Doctor, what would I do to do with that?"
And the doctor, says, "A has these benefits and these risks, and Be's got these risk."
"What do you want to do that?"
And you rebe, "Dr. if she was me, what do you do to do that?"
And the doctor: "But I'm not leight."
The result of the result of malat," expression that makes it look like a good thing.
But it's not that one to move the weight and the responsibility of decisions, which is a doctor, to somebody else who knows that that not -- and it's not not in the ideal condition, and so it is not in the ideal condition, to make the patient.
There's a huge marketing of drurugs products -- direct to people like me and you, if you think of it doesn't have any send sense, because we can't buy them.
But if we can't buy them, why are they public them, why are they they do that?
The answer is that they want to do that domorning, we call the doctor.
Something of so fundamental as it is our ority now. It's a question of choice, as you see in this journey -- "We don't want to force the children.
And we can reinvention ourselves how many times we can reinvent.
which means that every morning -- to the risky, you have to decide that kind of person wants to be.
And it was to the family and the matrimonia -- a time perspective perspective, almost for anybody anybody else was that he was married the most preme possible and then we can make the most premived.
The only real choice was with while, not when that yeah, and even what to do later.
Over the day, it's really to play.
I think of very smart, and I do their 20 percent of work than a time.
And because they're not less diligents, because they're less diligents.
but why are they implemented to ask ourselves, "Would I marry or no?
"Would I marry back to me late? I have to think before the kids or care?"
They're interrogatives now.
And they try to answer these questions, even though this implement, not completing the company and not to get a good vote to my exame.
And they really have to do that. I'm very important.
Now, the job: we're lucky, like Carl underlym; because technology allows us to work every day, from the Hotel Randolph.
And in parents, there's a corner, and I don't say anybody and not to anybody where the WiFi works.
I don't say that that because I want to use it.
What is that meaning, this incredible freedom of choice that we have to work on the work? Is it that we have to work or not.
We can go to see our son play, with the cell phone in a pocket in a pocking; and the notebook, typically on the knee.
And even though they're all sheep that we see our son rovince the headline, we're also asking the headline, we're also asking this call?"
"Do I have to answer this email? I have to emasize this literally ly?
And even when the answer is "no," this makes the experience of your games of your son, very different than what it would be in other conditions.
So, we look at any part of we look at the little big, things and style -- -- -- life is a question of choices.
Of the world was this: Ovo, there were some possibilities, but it was not a question of choice.
The world of today, the world today is the dilemma is, "Is it a positive thing, or negative thing?"
The answer is St.
The positive of the good side, so I will talk about the negative of the negative of the negative side.
All this choice behavior two negative effects about people.
The primarily paradoxyyly, is that produces instead of freation.
With many options between the bowl that choods, it becomes very hard to do it.
I give you an example of a significant example: a study of volunteer pensionation.
A colleague has had access to the data of Vanguard, the giant society of pension, with about a millions of customers in 2,000 different companies.
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are offered in the more, the percentage of adedession of the percentage of the flow.
With 50 funds of offeres, there's 10 percent in less than deaths when they're available only only 5. Why?
Because with 50 founds of the fingerties, it's maledededed, and choice comes to the inman.
And to questions, and more, questions, questions, and of course, questions, and of course, questions don't get it.
You know that it doesn't just mean that means that these old workers will be going to be giving for the can, because they don't have enough money, to say that the decision is so obsticle fundamental foundation of the workers of work.
Not participator, they're losing until 5,000 dollars from the work, which would be drinkling.
So the paralysis is a consequence of having too many choices.
And I think that makes the world like this.
"And finally, for the ethchup, walls or a maine?"
You should be taking the right decision if it's for the eternity, right?
You don't want to choose the wrong and the wrong condition of the wrong condition of it.
So this is the first effect. The second is that even though we can avoid paralyside, and make a choice, we are less religion from the result of how we would have been with less options between which we would choose to what they choose to them.
And this is for different reasons.
One of these is that with a lot of conditional conditional bodies -- if you buy one and it's not perfect, it's easy to imagine that you could make a better choice. And what happens is that the alternative imagined us to be better. And what happens is that the alternative imagined us to be between, and the rempiant defflit of the decision of the decision --
even when it was a good decision.
More choices us are very easy to do any detail, that is unsound of any option.
And yeah, there's what economists call cost-opportunity.
Dan Gilbert has very well stamattine as the values that we give things to the value,
Del rest, when there are many options as options as possible, is easy to represent the alternative shooting and being less reliable of option that is choice.
Here's an example. I have all the ones that are not New York.
But it's what you probably think about it.
There's this pairy couples to Hamptons.
A place of the sluxury.
Spilas a spleny. It's all for them.
Not laugh. But what he thinks he is, "Well, malediblind."
"All my neighbors in Manhattan is alive.
"I could park just parking in front of the home."
And he spent two weeks that the idea that it's losing -- every day -- the chance of parking where it wants.
The expensive opportunity is decreasing for what we have, even when the choice was excellent for what we have,
And the more than the options we have to be considered, more the characteristic characteristics return us against opportunity.
Here's another example.
This is a lot of things.
It talks about the time -- and maybe of the living slowly.
But the most important point is that anything you choice, you can choose to not do others.
The things that we don't choose to a lot of attractive active what we do.
Third point: the spiral growth of waiting.
I tried it on my skin buying a new couple of jeans.
I was almost always going to go to jeans.
Onnce the jeans were just like, they bought and they were swing them and they were swinged a life and work and work and work and work and work and work and lots of times, starting to go well.
So, I went to buy a couple of jewans, when the old people had go, and said, "I'm a couple of jeans, this is my cutt."
The committed me to say, "Li wants to fit, rexed fashion --
Do you want to do a cernier or with the bottonies? "Wed" or "acid" or "acid" or "hed?
"Do you want to be a lot.
"Would you like a bunch or close? Ble -- he was he was he was elencars.
I was smart, and after a little bit of a little bit of a little -- that was the only one guy -- that was the only one guy who was so so I tried to all "male," and I went out from the negotis; I went out of the negoti, and I was out of the best in the last couple of jeans that I had ever had.
It was the male of it. With all that choice had gotten the bit.
But I felt worse.
Why? I wrote a book to understand it.
The reason I was worst that I was worst with all that choice were altising.
And I was waiting. I didn't expect about exceptional when I was just a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a perfect.
What I had watched was good, but not perfect it.
After I had paragoned to what I tried I was inherated in confront.
The add of options in life of people don't make it increased the expectations that these have respect to the options of options in the same time.
And this will be less reliable to do unddisfation, even when the results are good for it.
Nobody in the marketing world of marketing if it makes it content.
Because if you know that I am not going to be talking about.
The truty looks more like this.
"It was better when it was worse when the worst is better when it was better when it was worst that when it was worst that was still possible to meet some of pleasure.
Over the world we live -- opulplants, industrialized citizens with the expectation of perfeation -- the maxiety that we can hope is that things are at the expectancy of waiting.
You're not going to be surprise to because your expectations -- my expectations are ingigantites.
The secret of happiness -- what you're here -- is, "Basit waity."
I mean -- little little bit of authographic moment, which are really married and my wife is really sture.
I couldn't have better, I didn't have to do better, I didn't have to do better.
But it is not always a good thing.
And finally, a consequence of buying a couple of jeans -- when you have only that jeans is that when you're not satisfacts, and ask you "Why?
"Who is responsible?" The answer is clear.
The world is the responsible. What would I do about that?
When there are hundreds of jeans, and you buy a insoddisfact, and you ask you who is responsible to you, it's the responsible that the responsible you're you.
You could have better better than that.
With hundreds of variety of available variety of unsuccess.
So when people get decisions, even though the result is valive, they feel insodden and they give the same.
In the last few years depression is exploded in the industrialized world
I think a significant factor, not the only one of this depression -- of this depression is that people have deludent to because standards are too high.
And when they need to explain this situation thinking, that the guys is them.
So the final result is that we are better, objectively, but we feel more worse.
Let me say that.
This is the official dogmaybe, what we all take for good and it's completely fail.
There's no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than a little bit better than a few choice is better than a little bit better than a little bit.
There's a critical value.
But I'm sure we have overcome from a piece of the level that the choices better.
Now, from the political point -- I almost finished -- from policy, nock point of view, the nock is the following.
What it allows all this choice in industrial society is the material wealth is the material.
There are many places in the world, and you know about the problem is not that they have too much choice.
The problem is that they have too much of it.
So the factory that I'm talking about is a malasive, that I'm talking about the moderns, rich societies.
And what it makes to depress and angry is this: Steve Levitt talked about how the cost and seats seats are useful.
I mean that these choices, complicated and dispended on it, it's not just inuseless.
I'm just delets up.
They make worse again.
If a little bit of what in our societies societies allowed to choice was reverse in those where people have too much possibility, not just their life to improve but the noway, the noway,
This is what economists call a paretyan improvement between.
It's a redistributation of the redition is good at all -- not just to the poor -- because of this choice in a very extend that it up.
And to conclude --
Voic: How do you think about it -- "What does that believe that fish?"
"It's obvious that you can't make anything in a mess of wet."
"An imagination, a limited vision of the world --
and I was also interpreted it like this, at the beginning.
But then, I realized that that fish the long time.
Because the reality of the fact is that if you send the bocky of the bought -- so that "everything is possible."
If you break the mouse in a way that everything becomes possible diminds the satisfation.
Wait to get paralyside, and you reduce the benefit to be benefit to be good.
They all need a sphere.
This is almost certainly too closed, maybe even weight for fish, and certainly for us.
But the abasence of some symbolic symbolic symbolic symbolic and themselves.
Thank you very much.
