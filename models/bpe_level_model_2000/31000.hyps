I showed these last year I showed these slide to show that the glacial calculation for almost three million years had the sizes of 48 million years had the sizes of 48 percent of the United States of 40 percent.
This is a lot of this underestimate the problem because it doesn't show the often of ice ice ice ice ice as ice ice of ice ice ice ice as ice ice as ice as ice as ice as ice as ice as the ice of ice ice because it doesn't show the fat of the problem because it doesn't show it of the ice.
The art glacial climb is, in a sense, the heart of the global climate heart of the global climate system.
It is expands of inveries and you get right.
The next slide will be a fastic rapid on the last 25 years.
The glyack is drawed in red it.
As you see it until the blue screen.
That's the ice in the winver, which is that you get right.
You can see that the glacious ice ice glacious glacious glacious -- is like the blood of the body.
In 25 years was going to go away from this here.
This is a problem because the interested in the art of the art of the art in the ocean art where there are huge amount of carbon that shared that sheet that sheet that sheets are transformed in meters from microbies.
Rempt to the totality of the atmospheric warming, that amount of global warming, that amount of not going to go back to this point of not coming back.

Video: Wow! As good. The question is whether we will be well.
A reason is that this exchange that this termac surrises the Greenland the Greenland from the north.
This is a glacial ur riglacial ur river.
The took never reached levels.
This is the Kangerlusasic uver, in the south of the Greenland of the Greenland of the Greenland of the Greenland of the Greenland of the Greenland in the south.
If you want to know how the level, the level, the levels of the glevel, here is where the sea.
These rents are increasing rapidly.
Another part of the planet: Antart, the biggest block of the planet.
The scientists have declared to the glacious of ice is in negative ice is in negative and that Antarctartics in the West in the West in the islands underwater in shormic.
Equid six meters of water level, like in Greenlevel, in Greenland in Greenland, in Greenlevel.

40 percent of the world's population was going to get half of the pollown.
One is the glacier of the water is the source of this city.
The carried was increased.
But when he diminished, the same thing happens to the water.
In California is the snonow, the Sierra is diminuth.
The richines are in crisis.
The predictions, like you have gone level, are grave.
The growing cities in the world door to an income to a remarkable increasing.
The environmental disasters are increasing a returns out of the normal and without precedents.
Four times more numbers in the last 30 years to precedents to 75.
This is a sustainable gain of the unsustainable gather.
If you look at the context if you can see the consequences.
In the last five years we added 70 million tons of CO2 to 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the oceans every day.
Look at the point of the oriental Pacific American East America, and the west, and on the bottom, and in the subcontinent in the subside of the oxygen in the oceans.
The major warming, and the most of global warming, together to deforestation, which is 20 percent, is the use of fossil.
Oil is a problem, and the carbon is a problem, and the carbon is even worse.
The United States are one of the two countries with the more emissions, together at China.
And it propose to build a lot of other central central charcoal.
But we're looking at a way of direction.
These are the annual projects in the last few years and some greenhouse proposes of greenhouse proposecks.
So there's a political lotly political in our country.
The carbon and oil industry and oil industry have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote the carbon and oil industry.
The image reminded me remind me of somethings.

So our priority is to invest a great amount of money in a public effort to make public and confused to make the truth, and confused the truth,
In fact, the carbon is not sport.
We think it's clean -- it also has a good profum.
So not preocupated,
Let me do to do it.

So let's do a game structure at a structure at the clean to the carbon of the clean it.
Straordinary machines are a little romore! The machines are a little bit of the technology.

We need to go away away, que.
Thank you very much.
The year last year TED fect on the LHC.
And I promise to go back to how the machine.
So I got it. And for those who the other time they don't have the other time in the LHC is is the biggest scientific experiment -- 27 miles of circumstomers.
His comfortable to reach the conditions that were present less than a billion second from the beginning of the universe -- until 600 million times a second.
And this is just environment.
This is the machine underneath Gineva.
We photographs these mini-Big Bang Big Bang in the reevators.
This is what I work. It's called ATLAS -- is 44 meters and has a diameter of 22 meters.
This is a spectacular image of ATLAS in building so you can see the proportions.
The 10 secember last year we have access, we went to the first time.
And this picture was taken by ATLAS.
It was a lot of immenses in the control.
It's a picture of the first particles that had done all the game, in the LHC, and in the collision, deliberately, deliberately, and spread particles inside the LHC, and spread particles inside the relievator.
In other words, when we see that the 10 10 times 10 times we see that the machine work, we see that the machine work, which is a great liftye.
I don't know if it was to do it more opportunity to Google and he saw it was this one on Google and saw that the papaining was this one.
That means that we had a cultural impact that we had a cultural impact to the scientific impact.
About a week later, there was a problem with the machine, it had to these skin this -- these dioxiety files.
These films take 13,000 feet when the machine works at the massive power.
Now, technical technical of you look at films and say, "It's not true. I'm too under the underneath it."
And they can do it because when they are very quickly cold films that are the superconvictors.
So, at the 271 degrees, at a inferior temperature in the space between the stars, these files can take that corrup.
In one of the most of the magnets in the LHC, there was a defectly defected.
So files you get a lot of warming laws and 13,000 prints suddenly met resistance.
This was the result.
Now, this is even more impressing if you think that these magnets are about 20 centimeters and that have been moved about 30 centimeters.
They are damaged about 50 magnets.
We had to take you, what we did we do do it.
We have them repristine and additive.
They're now now now they're going back to the ground.
Entruth, the end of the LHC is will be new integrating.
We let it out, and we expect to get the data or squarter or him, and continue so our wind to find out what the universe.
Now, of course, in a certain fource, these crashed the debate of science and engineering. It's easy to conflict. It's easy to confuture.
I think that it's so difficult that it's so difficult to go beyond the limits, I think is the value of things like LHC.
I want to end with the words of a scientist Ingless, Humphrey Davy, what, what, in defense of his inuseful experiments of his cleaning Michael Faray, said, "No is so dangerous for the progress of the human mind that is a dangerous mind of the science that are definitive, which is not in nature, and in natures, which is not in natures, which is completely new mone."
Thank you.
I want to start asking you to rethink about this here, as a kids, you playing with kids, coins.
And while you realize them and reaching them and reaching them and realized them and moving them and resolving them and resolving them and eat thinking and handipoling relationships.
The reason is deeply is deeply connected to the way we understand a lot of the world around us.
So, from information information of our interaction with physics, with physics, together to my consults, and my collaboratory and my collaboratory and collaborator Jeevan Kalthi, I started asking mouse as we have a computer, instead of the mouse as a pastredigital information that moving on a desktop, we actually have a little bit of a top, further information with ent,
and it will be a foot of our pleas?
The question was so interesting that we decided we decided we decided we could explore the answer to the answer --
In a few words, a Siftable computer is a big discouple of a big discope.
In a few words, a Siftable computer is a big discouple of a big discope.
You can move them with the hand, they can see it in them, they feel the movement and have a screen and a wireless.
But more than the point is physics, as physics, as the kids, you can just be simply fly remote it.
The See is the example, a new ecosystem of manipulate information.
And as they get more physics, and as the physics, and as we know of the other way, and as they get more physics, and as it turns out of the movement, of the others, like we die and we can explore new stiles and interactions of the interactions of the interactions of the interaction.
I'm going to start with some simple example.
This See is configurated to show video video -- if you including it in a direction, the video it will be like this, if you get it from the other side back.
These interactive riticians are aware of the other people.
If they are in the business thing is they are in what they are around it.
If they come surround and they can get a little bit of a little bit of it.
If they come surround and they can get a little bit of a little bit of it.
They also have their movement and inclination.
We realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was the power to use common the data, to the common for example, "Dr.
In this case, we have three Siftable configurated as a green seckets and I can use them to take the colors in the central central where they mix are mix.
and I can use them to go to the color in the central central where they mimix of the central color.
If we can get too much, we can put a little bit about place.
There's also beautiful possibilities of learning, as language, mathematics and played logical things that quickly, and see the logical things quickly, and see the immediately.
Now I'm --
This is a Fibonacus that I do with a program of equations.
Here we have a word of words that is in Scarabeo and Boggle.
In the case of course, you get a letter to every turn on every Siftable, Pratically, at every turn Siftable, and you get a letter on every Siftable, and as a certain words of a dictionarie.
Then, after about 30 seconds remissing, and you have a new set of lects, and you can try to try to try to prove and new possibilities.
Thank you.
Here's the kids came in the Middle Lab, I did in a way that they tried them and I sent a video.
They were like this.
And one of the interesting things about this kind of applied appliances of the instructions.
You only have you says, "The pononone," and they know what to do.
Here's what other people who try it.
This is our most youngest bete, there on the right.
It actually wanted to be a large clums.
They just were coming to him.
Now, this is a kind of an interactive cardboard of interactive card.
We wanted to build a tool of the Luy Lui is Felix.
It can put new characters in the scene, suggested the Siftable their associats.
It can put new characters in the scene, suggested the Siftable their associats.
And that's doing the sun.
Video: The only is sungenius is sunging.
David Merrill: Now has taken a treat in the scene.
Video: The treat.
Bel work!
So school by Siftable and put them next to the people can interact the characters --
Video: Bau!
-- by inventing their story.
Video: Cya!
DM: It's a story with the open-open-up, and it can decide as you woulds.
DM: It's a story with the open-open-up, and it can decide as you woulds.
Video: Volole, gactly.
DM: The last example, I have time to show you is a recently recently, to be a recently and execguy and execguy and execguess music.
It's a instrument, realized recently, to change and execk and execk music.
The See skin here act sound like based and batteria.
Every one of these has four different variations, and you can choose what you use it.
You can get these sound these sound sound in a sequence,
And to modify it simply doing a sound "sound a sequence."
These are effects that you can control from living, like the reverse and too much.
The attacks, and then it was going to be able and then including it.
And then there are the general effects like time and volume, which is applied in the sequence.
Let's look at how it works.
Video: We start with a basic in two Sift" in two Sift" sequence, we system, the extendil, we will add it on the extendiles, we add other base.
Now I put a baside.
Video: DM: Now I add the percent --
Video: And I'm going to put the movie to the bacteria, so I can control the effect of the live.
Video: I know fast the whole sequencing the whole sequencing the whole sequence, or the other.
Video: Something to give the movie to the bottom to give more expression.
Video: I know how to fight the sequence "Sequence."
So I don't have to planning it before, but I can try and provise, make it more or the short or the short or the short or the short or the short of the long or the short or the short of the long or the cortas.
And now, finally, I can get the whole sequencing the whole sequencing the entire Siftable and the "volume."
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is build new man, machine is to build new man, and more more look like our brain and cord.
And I today, I had time to show you one of the results of this percords and also some possibilities that we try to bring out the lab.
The concept I want to transmit you is that is coming this new generation of objects for the digital media of digital media that will be information in our world that we want to do.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the time to talk to everybody with all of you.
I'm a written screen.
And I wrote books is my profession, but it's more than that, of course.
It's also love and the fashck of my life.
And I don't expect that it can change it.
But I say that, something particular is recently happened in my life and in my career, which has taken me to realibrate the whole reality of this work.
The particular thing is that I recently written this book, this book, this biography called "Mangia, Ama" -- my libris, for some reason for some reason for some reason in the world and became a big sensational.
And the result is that everywhere from now, people are treats as if I was convicted.
It's true -- convict: convict!
They come from me and say, "You've all worried and say, "Don't you afraid to be able to do better?
You don't afraid to continue to write for all life without any longer to be able to create a book that can be able to create a book,
which can be to do someone who must it?"
It's absolutely about, you know.
But it could go worse, I remember 20 years ago, I remember 20 years ago, when I started to say people -- I was an adolescent -- I was a writtric.
I was actually in the same reaction reaction of the same reaction of the fear.
And people said, "Don't you any time to be success?
Don't you afraid that the humiliation of the rid of the refurther you have to kill you walk away?
You don't fear to do this mesture for all of life that without any new life that never come out and die on a heart of whips on a heart of sharp with the shop of falt to love of faltic faltic faking?"
So, you know.
The short answer -- the short answer to all of these questions is, "Si."
I fear of all of those things.
I always had to be afraid of it.
And I also have a lot of other things that people can't have to be there.
As a lot of other things and other things scary.
But as I think about the write of what I thought and I wonderful is because is?
Is it ration?
It's logic, who who needs to be waiting from a work that I feel feel that you feel out of a work that I heard to do.
But what is that particular in the impresely creative to make us about the mental health mental health in a way that other career doesn't do?
How my father, for example, he was a chemical engineer and I don't remember one time in his 40 years of the activity in which he was asked if he was to be engineer if he had purpose to be engineing to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer than it was a chemistry in his 40 years of the activity that was a little bit of a chemistry and I don't
It never was that there is that the engineer of John, how do it?
It doesn't work, it doesn't work, right?
Enestly, the engineers as group doesn't certainly, in the centuries, the reputation of the reputation of being alcohyacks.
We writtors, we have enough this reputation, and not just writers -- but creative feeding to be enormous instable.
And it's not really, what looks at the context of the deaths of the magnitude magnitude of the creative dead in the century, they die and often for them to hand they often hand.
And the ones that are not suicidden to be really disrupted, they are really disrupted.
Norman Mailer, before I die, in the last interview said, "My book, my book, he killed me a little further than the work of their life.
But we don't bat the way we heard about why we heard these so long that somehow we have these things that we are completely interior and accepted the notion that creativity and the notion that creativity and the end, finally, it will always be in a woodsnail.
And the question I want to ask all of this ideas?
It goes you have this -- because it looks like a centimeter of the distance to me not good for this supposed to do anything this suppose suppose that suppose is not good for this suppose -- because it looks like.
I think it's hodious.
And I think it's dangerous and I don't want to see the perpetuate in the next century.
I think it's better encouraging our big minds creative to live.
And I know that in my case -- in my situation -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to the dark feeling towards the dark circumstances where I am in my career.
Okay, it's a young, I have about 40 years.
I still have about four decadecade of work in me.
And it's very likely to what I write is that I will be right now in the world as the work that used by the world as the work that used after the work that was going to be right from my last book.
I'm going to be sky, because we all are or less friends here -- is probably the most of the greatest friends to my shoulder.
Oh, Gesus, that thous!
You know this is the kind of thinking about that person to start a person to start bad in the morning, and I don't want to do it.
I would keep doing this work that we have.
So, the question become and like, what?
And so I seed it after a lot of reflections, which the way to work to keep the way is to create a psychological psychological psychological psychological structure, right?
I have to find a distance of safety safety of me, that I'm written -- and my natural reaction of the reaction of the reaction of the year I was trying to get out of the time to look through time, trying to find out more societies to be able to see if they could have some other societies to see if they could have some more societies to have the best ideas they could have the best ideas and healthy is that I could have more societies and healthy in the time,
how to help creative people to deal with inerents emotional inherents of creative emotion.
And that research for the ancient Greea and Roma.
You eguitems because it was in some circle and then back.
In the ancient Grecia and Rome -- people don't seem to believe that creativity came from humans, OK?
It was thinking that creativity was this is about the divine and that came to men from a few surface and unknown that was a few distant and unknown for distants and unknown out.
The greglass called these demons' demons."
Socrate, wonderful, believed to have a demon that elargiving wisdom.
The Romans were of the same idea, but they call the kind of spirit without body a genius.
The is that great because the Romans didn't really think that a kind of a kind of smart genius was somebody particularly smart.
They believed that a kind of a kind of divine entity that was going to be live in the walls of the study of an art of an art Dobby, and that was out of the Dobby, and that was out of the work of the work of the artist of the work of the artist of that work.
Excectal -- et, that's the distance of what I -- that psychological construct that protected you from your work.
And everyone knew that was so that it works, right?
So the antic artists were protected by certain things, like the too narcism, no?
If your work was exceptional was not going to take it all the market, everybody knew that was helped by this encourage that I was helped by this encourage.
If your work was not all of your falterm, right?
They knew that was your genius to be a little bit of a being a skin that they were going to be a unable to be a inability.
And so people have concept the creativity in Occident for a long time.
And then the Rinascise came and all of the change, and this big idea; we put the human human being; we put the human beings on all the middle and the misteries and and the creatures of the creatures of the creatures of the divinity.
This was the raational principle of the rational humanity and people started thinking that creativity came from the idu.
And for the first time in history, he started to refer this or that artist as a kind of a fairly that is a fairly that person with genius.
And I have to tell you, I think it was a big herr.
I think that allowing somebody to believe that it is like a recipe of being like a recip, and the surgern, and the surgernal mysteries and inches and etherns is a responsibility to be a film, to be a film, too big, to give fragile human fragile frgible,
It's like to ask someone of engineer the sun.
Deform and completely the ego and creates all these expectations on the performance.
And I think it was this pressure to destroyed the artists in the past.
And if this is true, and I think that is, and I think, and now?
Can we do it different?
And I think I would go back to a more ancient understanding of the relationship between humans and mystery and mystery of humans and mystery of the relationship between humans and mystery to a more than the relationship between humans and mystery of humans and mystery.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we can't cell 500 years of road thinking about a road talk about a 18 minutes.
And there is probably people in the audience that would be suspects, you know, the scientific news on the notion of the notion that they followed people in their projects.
And I probably don't convinced you all about this thing.
But the question I would like to ask is -- why is?
Why don't think it in this way?
Because it has more sense of all the other thing that has ever heard to explain the impredictability of creative process.
A process, like anyone who has ever tried to do something -- so fundamentally, everybody here -- yet you don't understand it.
And in fact, it can seemems completely paranormal looks.
I did this met recently with the extraordinary poeter Ruth Stone, which has now 90 years, but that was a poeter for all life, and he said that during his own life and he said that during his own own own in the rural Virginia, was working out in the field when a poem poem was from the landscape.
He said that it was like a told on the air.
And he came rolling up to the landscape.
It heard it comes to the ground under his feeling land under his feet.
He knew that is to have one thing to do to that point and it was saying "hell like a morn."
And it really, it comes home and came up from this poem poem and he would not have to do other than taking a piece of paper, and a pretty much fastic in the freezing and it on the page.
Sometimes he couldn't be quickly, so he's run, and it record and record and the record and the poem poos and the rops the rops and the lost of the rope and it would continue to rotate through the landscape, and he would continue to roll through the land."
And then there were those times -- this piece never forget it -- there was no time that was the nearly losing almost lost, right?
So, he was running at home and he was looking for the card and the poetry was looking through a nail, and he was going through a nice in the past and then he said, that it was like you get away with the other hand and the off.
He had the poem poeth, and the reputs in his body and turned it on the page.
And in these cases, the poem would be presented on the perfect and intact intact page to the last word to the first one of the last word to the first first one.
So when I heard about -- it's crazy exactly the same creative process.
Not all my creative process -- I'm not a convict!
I'm a mule, and my way to work is down, you wake up at the same horary every day and souldn't get and go over and go over and go over and go over and spend the enjoys.
But even in my mind, in my head, I found that thing, at the time.
And I imagine that many of you have a lot of you have it.
You know, even if the work and ideas and ideas and ideas and ideas I could not honestly know.
And what is this thing?
And how can we react it in a way that we don't want to lose our head, rather than it is it going to stay head up?
So I think about it, the best example, I have the best example, I have the Tom Waits, which I interviewed different ago for a newspapers.
We were talking about this, and you know, Tom, and you know, Tom, the majority of life was the incarnation of the artist of the argue contemporary creative species of the creative kind of creative creative impulses of creative impulse creative species of the creative creative impulse creative of the kind of creative life has been the innation of the way of the life of the life was the incarnation of the way of the life was the incarnation of the majority of the arti
But then he was a little bit of it, and one day as he was driving on a highway to the authrow in Los Angeles, changed all for him.
He was going to fast and all of a lot of a lot of the milodia, which is in his head as it does inspiration, and elusive and elusive and it, and the want, you know, is wonderful, and the desire, but it doesn't know how to take it.
It has no piece of paper, it doesn't have a nitut, it has no recorator.
So it starts to feel this kind of old old old old old old old old him, and I'm going to him, and I'll remarring obsessioned by this song.
I'm not good enough and I can't do it."
And instead of go to the panic stop.
And he saw the whole process and he did something completely new thing.
He looked at the sky and said, "Scuse, you see I'm not see?"
"You think it looks like that can write a song now?
If you really want to exist, it in a more opportunity when I can take care of you.
Other people are going to get someone else now.
You go to the waste Leonard Cohen."
And his process was working changed after this.
Not work, the work was still as a seed.
But the process, and the fish anks that was released when the genie, the genius, the genius, the genius, which was that the other thing that is that the other than the problems and they realized it was not to be a whole thing that he had to be a whole thing that was a whole thing and I mented.
But the way this is that a conversation between Tom and a conversation between Tom and this strange thing that was not Tom. And this strange thing that but it was not Tom.
So I felt that story began to change a little bit of a little bit of a time I was worked and saved me a time.
This idea, saved when I was writing "Mangia, Prega, Ama," and fall in one of those cave of the disperation where we all are working on something and we don't do and and we start thinking that is going to be a disaster, that that is going to be a booking.
Not just a book, the worst book, written --
And I started thinking about designing this project.
But then I remember Tom who talked to the air and triaway.
So I went to my face on the written and I would say, my comments at a corner of the room.
And I said to you, "Yeah, now, both you know, both that this book is not going to be brilliant not going to be brilliant not going to be brilliant, right?
Because as I see I am putting what I have, not more than that.
So if you want to be better and you have to show you and you have to get you and make your party.
Okay. But if you don't do it, you know what it is, I don't know about it.
I'm going to write the same because my work.
And I would like to do that was recorded to today I today today I showed to my own own own part, because of the end of the North th Africa in the deserts of the North people dances in the long dances and the music and the sacred and music and the sacred and sacred to the higher and the sacred to the high and the hours to the albe.
And they were always charge because the ballers were professional and they were fantastics.
But every one one of these artly, something happened, and one of these artists became translent.
And I know what I know about what I know is, because I know that you all all of the time, a performance like this.
It was like the time you stop, and the ballery walking through a kind of landing through a lot of different from the way from the solite, but all of the way from the solite, but everything was at the inevil.
And suddenly it doesn't just like a human human one.
But you access, and under and underlump and underneath the divinity.
And when this happen, the them, the people people know what it was called the name with his name.
They were congiving hands and they started singing, "Allah, Doh.Allah, Do, God."
That's God, you know.
And they were known to the South World World the Spna, and they ran this south of the Spn, and they raise the printounced in the centuries of "Ah, Allah, Allah, Allah, who's still in the correct or flew in the corrector flew it in the cords,
In Spain, when an artist made something impossible and magic -- and magnituation, "Ah, oh, magnific magnific -- -- I mean, except -- a fall -- one short of God.
And it's great because we need it.
But the problem comes day down, the ballery is when you wake up and discovering that are the 11 a.11 ath, and found it and God is not going to go up and fast God is not more.
It's just a death, with the knes of the knes and perhaps it never will be able to ascent to that height up to that altee alteth.
And perhaps no one will be the name of God while it has to do it with the rest of his life?
It's hard to it.
This is one of the most dolorous reconciliations to make a creative life.
But perhaps not to be so ancient if you can not believe that it doesn't believe it, in the extraordinary that the most extraordinary extraordinary of your being from you are coming from you to yourself.
But believe that they just come from a income, you know, you have been in a inimaginables of your life that you have to go to somebody else when you finished.
And you know, if we think in this way.
And so I started thinking about it, and it's surely as I thought for different months during the book, I think, about the book that I public in the book, the dangerous charge of my great successful book, and I followed my great successful books.
And what I have to keep on the electric when I feel electricity is not afraid of this is, not afraid of the time.
Don't go to the right him.
He talks to you to present you to be for your party, any of the slump.
If your work is dance, dance, dance,
If the divine, I assurd to assumption of leaving some kind of wonderful kind of wonderful time through your efforts through your efforts through your efforts -- then "Ole!"
Other people clean the same dance.
And "Ole!" to yourself.
I think I think you have to teach it.
"Ole!" at yourself the same, just for human and headadvertising talks to to the continue talks to you to do you continuously.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
As you know I've talked about some of these projects on human human genome on what it means and discovering new set of gene gene of genes.
Now we're starting a new lock: we started to start digitalizing biology and now to go from that code code of that code code and synthetizing and synthetic and synthetizing life.
We always tried to take big questions.
"What is the life?" is something that many biological biological tried to understand various levels.
We tried to the minimum and reduced to the minimum minimum of the terms.
We're digitalizing by almost 20 years ago.
When we sequenced the human genome was going to go from the analogic world of biology in the digital world.
Now we asked us to regenerate life, or create new life from this digital universe that digital universe that we have to be a digital universe to this digital universe life, or create new life from this digital universe from this digital universe from this digital universe we asked us.
This is the map of a little organism, the Mycoplasma genitalium, which is the smallest genome of those that can autoreplicate in the laboratory.
And we tried to reduce the genome to create a little bit of a little bit more smaller.
We are able to eliminate a hundred genes of the around 500 people who are here.
But when we look at his map to its metabolic, is relatively simple respect to the noie.
See me this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can elimind, one at the time, is very unlikely that this can bring to a live.
So we decided that the only way to progress is synthesize this chromosome, so that we could actually modify to move some of these fundamental questions.
And so we started the wind of the "Can we synthesize a chromother?"
Can chemistry of provide provide these big molecules that we never ever ever manage?
And, in fact, we can make a cromosound?
A chromosome, it's just a piece of chemical material.
The speed with which we can deal of digitizing life is growing at the exponential running exponential speed with the exponential speed with the life is growing exponential speed that we are able to degitizing the life of the speed to growing life is growing the exponential speed of the speed that we are able to de
Our ability to write the genetic code of genetic code.
And our recently, results the results the brand on a exponential curve.
We started 15 years ago.
The process has been required a lot of the past, starting with a biothic reviews before the first experiments.
But we found that synthesize DNA is very difficult.
There are decade of thousands of cars in the world that produce small segments of DNA, the long equality of 30 to 50 to 50 to lette and it's a degenerative processing is longer and it's a degenerative process.
So we had to develop a new methodd to assembling these fragments and rors the mistakes the middle of them.
And this was our first topic, from the digital information of the digital genome of Phi 174.
It's a little viruses that kills killed batteries.
We designed the fragments, effectured the mistakes and get a molecule, and you get a DNA of about 5,000 letters.
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemical material material and we put it in the bacteria and we put it in the bacteria started reading this genetic code and producing viralals.
The virals are then released by cells, they came back and behind and they have destroyed the E.
I talked about recently with recently oil industry says they certainly understood that they certainly understood this model.
They have more than you.
We believe that this is a situation where the software can really build his own own own hardware in a biological system.
But we wanted to do things in the bigger things.
We wanted to build the whole chromosome.
It's more than 580,000 miletting code code of genetic code.
So we thought about built it in the size of the virus, so that we can change the cassets to change the cassets to understand what the components are a living cell.
The design design is crucial information and if we start with digital information in a computer, these have to be very accurate it.
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 accuratezing was a standard for every 10 minds the 10,000 mibasis.
We found out of the resequencing, 30 mierror sequence, we never had that original sequence.
A part of the process is to design, to be a lot of the levels that you moving with all the other seats of 50 letters of the 50 letters of the labor to build underunit together.
We try to put until elements here.
You probably read that we read the phylie.
Think it like this, we have a genetic code genetic code on four letter: A, C, and T.
Three of those letters codify of the middle of the middle of letting for every lominoacid of letting for every load.
So we can use the genetic code to write words, though.
What we did in the beginning was autone of the beginning is automatic.
Some have been deployed by the fact that it was not poeking.
We designed these gments for them to just just just to join with the entire history.
There are gathers that they repaid them and they put them and put them together.
And we started assembling the parts, starting with five to seven my seven seven milk of a lot of the lects, and it was a lot of the letter to get 72 miles to get to 72 miletter to 72 miletter to get to 72 miles of the literal letter.
We spend all pass these segments in abundance so that we can sequence, so that we're trying to create a extremely robbbrobust, and you will see in a minute.
We're trying to automatizing the process.
So, this looks like the tabellon a basis of a basket.
When we go to these very longments, the more than 100 miles aren't growing the longer of the E.
It comes to the limited instruments of the modern biology.
So we considered other mechanisms.
We knew about another mechanism called "recombination of a biology that in biology is useful to repurpose DNA to deal with the DNA in the machines.
Here's an example.
This organism, called Deinococcus radiodurans, it can absorbing three million radiation.
You can see in the high require as his chromosome, as his chromosome.
In 12 -- 24 hours comes out of the exactly as it was before.
There are thousands of organisms that have been able to do it.
These organisms can be sitting on it.
They can live under empty.
I'm absolutely sure that life exists in space and you moved to find new environments of water.
In fact, NASA showed that this happen.
This is a molecules that we built that we built using these process, just using the boundaries of the design appropriate appropriate to the design appropriate segments of it.
The lievid the automatically.
This image was not taken with a electronic microscope, but with a microscope of a rular microscope of it.
It's a molecule, so big molecules we can see it with a law.
These are pictures that cover a period.
This is the publishing that we did a little time ago.
It's more than 580,000 letters, genetic code genetic code of genetic.
It's the biggest molecules that we ever created by man.
It has a molecular molecular on the 300 million people.
If we spend it with a 10 carar, without spaces, it would take 142 pages to just translate this genetic code.
Now, how do we do it work? How can we active?
Obviously, track a virus is a game from kids.
It's a little bit complicated when you use batteries.
It's also simpler when it comes to the eucarios as our re: you can simply extract the nucleum and put another one another, which is practically the process of clon.
In the archaean art is integrated in the cell phone is integrated in the cell, but we recently recently demonstrated that we are able to do a complete cell of a cell cell from a cell and activate it.
We can clean a chromosome, we can see a microbial species.
The two are different how men are from the touch.
We added some genes in a more way that we could decide what chromother for this chromodel for this chromother.
The one one has the gave with the inner gain and so that they can kill all the proteins.
And when we put it in the cellent cells was stuff -- and you appreciate our choicatos -- the new chromosome, the new chromosome, the new cell phone is gone in the cell.
And we started thinking we couldn't go beyond it, but we tried to go over there.
This is one of the machine.
We found that a lot of species have added a second or a third or a third of some hundreds of new hands of new trately, in a second hands of new trately.
So who's thinking about evolution as one gene of the modic is not a lot of the biology.
There are of the gerisms called restriction of restriction is that addict DNA.
The chromosome, it was in the cell.
The phone -- the cell phone -- the cell that we put it --
It's expressed and recognized the other cromosome, as an extrane; it has masticed it only has the cell, and we found with only the cell.
It became blue because of the genes we put it.
And in a short of time, all the feature of a kind of a kind of game, and it turned out of the new species, and it turned out to the new species, the new software that we put in the phone that we put in the cellule.
All the proteins are changed, the membranes are changed, and when we read the genetic code genetic code of what we transferition.
Now, this may seems like genetic, but altering the software DNA we can change things in the enough maniera enough of this is a sustain.
Now, I already explained that you don't talk about genesis -- but of progress from three million years from three million years of evolution, and I said that maybe we're going to create a new version of the Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosion of this digital process.
Why do that?
I think it's pretty obvious when we think about our needs.
We're going to go from six billion and a half people at nine billion in the next 40 years.
I was born to give an example: I was born in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for each of 1946, there are 40 years, there will be four year, there will be four year.
We're going to find out that we're going to find food, water and clean ita, medicinal and gas, gas, and a half half billion people.
It will be more harder, to do it for nine billion us.
We can clize more than five billion carbon and more than 30 billion barbarrels.
That means a hundred million barbarils a day.
When we try to find biological processes or any kind of process for replace to repirate them, is going to be a challenge of it.
In the more we have to keep all of the CO2 emission of these materials that finished in the atmosphere.
At day, thank you very much, because of the scientific discoveries in the world, we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I like to think that are the design components for the future.
The electronic industry has only been a dozen about a dozen of components, and think about how many different things are out of it.
Our limits here are data principlely by biological reality and our imagination.
Now we have a techniques, thank you very quickly have to these synthetization, in able to create what we call genomics.
We are able to build a big robots that can produce a million chromosomes a million hundred chromosomes at the day.
Think about the 20 million different genes or to try to get to optimize the processes to get optimize the processes or drugs, and we can change a little team, and create more biology in the last 20 years of science.
And it's just a standard selection of standard.
We can choose to survive, chemistry of chemistry, chemistry, production of chemistry of vaccines --
This is an instantly some software programmed on which we're working for seats to be able to seat us and design species and designing species to computer.
Well, we don't know necessarily as it will be no.
We know exactly what their genetic code.
Now we're concentrying on the walls of the fourth generation.
You have seen you see that you can experiment from the gran experiment was a finished experim.
We have a second further and generation generation that will come pretty soon as a zero fairly patchoices like the tanol.
But the only way that biology can have a big impact that the cost of the food and limited the cost of the food and limited the CO2 in the first materials that we are working on the opportunity that we are working on the design that we can get this discovering that they can reach this discovered carbon of the food generation in about 18 months.
The sunlight to the CO2 is a metodo-- but in our discoveries in all the world, we've found different different metodis.
This is a organism that we have described in 1996.
It lives in the ocean deep about 2,500 feet of the water temperature of the water.
It creates hold from CO2 using molecular energy as a source of energy.
We're trying to figure out whether we can put CO2, which can be transported by making tub, converting that CO2 in carbant, to drive this process.
So the short we think we could be able to increase what the basic question of the basic is Nothing truth, Nothing truth, is Nothing -- we have the modest oil, the modest industry.
Exactly. If you can't do it at TED, where can you do that?
It would become a major energy.
And young, we're working for using the same way to create vaccines.
You saw this year with influence, we are always background a year and a dollar in less when it's treatment.
I think that that that this can change building vaccinable in the ancient way.
This is how the future could began to look like changing, now, the tree of evolution, accelerating the evolution with synthetic bacteria and infinally cells.
We're at so much more than that.
Our purpose is to live to try to live to try to get very long enough to try to do it. Thank you very much.
I will do that I can see the most rapidly possible, some fundamental work that we took the Microsoft in the Microsoft in the followed to a water age. This is Seadragon. This is Seadragon.
It's a environment, you can interact is in the local level, which remote with a huge amount of views.
So we're seeing a lot of gabyte pictures of digital pictures with a coast, and continuous fast, to say, "What we want to image the images as we want to image the images as we want it.
And it doesn't matter how big we see how big we see it, how big we see it, how big we see -- how big these data or images.
Most of the digital photographs, but this for example, this for example, is a proventient from Bilibrary of Congress, and reents in the gam, 300 megapixel.
It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that the prestations of a system like this is the number of pixel on your screen in any moment. It's also an architecture that is also a very flexible.
This is a book, example, of data not images.
This is the See Casa Dicken's Scipe of Dicken's cool represents a capitol.
So to show you that it's just text text and not image, we can do something like this, to see a real representation of a real representation of the head, not a photo.
It could be a little bit of an artificial book.
It doesn't recommend it.
This is a more realistic. It's a number of Guardian example.
Every image is the beginning of a section.
And it gives you really like the pleasure and the beauty of read the version of a view or a newspaper or a newspaper or a quotidi, which is for nature of a lot of half a lot of half a lot of half a lot of middle of a lot of midddle and the beauty of a
We also did something with the angle of this number of Guardian of Guardian of Guardian of this number of this particular number of of of this particular number of of of this particular number of of this particular number of this particular number of this particular number of this particular number of this particular number of
We created a higher advertising fashion -- much higher than what you use in a normal published in a normal advertising content -- and we put you in the extra.
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile, you can see here.
Or other models, or even the specific specific specific models, or even the specific charges, or even the other models, or even the specific models, or even the textreme.
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limitations of space on the screen of the screen.
We hope this means to put pop up and other similar and other similes, not remove to be necessarily as you need to be necessary.
Of course, map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology.
And I don't want to lose time, if not to say that we have contributed to give it in this field.
These are all the streets in the USA obeviers of NASA.
So now we go to something else.
This is actually from the websk; you can go to the Web; you can see it.
It's about a project called Photosynth, which combine two different technologies.
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual computer very interesting computer in Noah Snavely, a student of the Washington, with the Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Seliski Reschrosoft Resch. Seliski Resch. Seliski is Seadraggs of the Uniavel, a student of the other interesting research of the University of the Uniavel, very interesting reselighter to the Uniavel,
And it's from Seadragonononished by Seadragonononon.
You can see it when we do this kind of screen -- where we can go from a picture of the other and have this kind of experience to multiple the kind of multiple.
But the space of the images here has actually a meaning.
The computer algorithms of the computer visualization made these together, in a way that the real images that the real image -- all the neighborhood -- all the neighborhood in the Grashs of Montags -- have been taken -- have been taken -- have been taken of a slide-show of a slide-show show showed this space.
I don't know if I have time to show you some other environment.
There are some more space here.
I want to go directly to one of the original data set of Noah-- and this is from a precedent prototype of Photosynths that we did work, for the first time -- to show you what I think is really the key is truly the key to the key this technology is really really really really evidence to look at the website. And it's not necessarily at the website,
We had to worry about legal aspects and saying it.
This is a rebuilding in the Cathral Dunches pretty images from Flickr. Basta digitate Notre Dame in Flickr. And you get images of these kinds of the types of these things in the sharing connects of these things to the represents a picture that is discovering this model.
So they are all picked up from Flickr and they were all colleged in this way.
And it's possible to navigate in this simple.
You know, I never thought of finish to end up Microsoft.
It's very gratify to get this kind of accool here.
I think you can see that it's a lot of different kinds of different kinds of focamone: from those of the photos of the SLR, a significant number of of different phones in this environment.
And if I can try to look at those strange strange.
Many are block down, etc., etc.
Somewhere you find a photographs -- there is a series -- exhim.
This is a Notre Dame is a poster of Notre Dame record.
We can go from the poster of the physics of this environment.
The essential point is that we can do things with the social environment. This is now taking from everything -- from the whole memory of view of views of view -- and it college all those data together.
All of those pictures become together, more of the parts.
You have a model of the land that is emerge.
Think about this as the movie of Stephen Lawler work on Earth virtual
It's something that is that it is that it is that people us, and the people that uses us, and the vantages for the people who uses to use.
Their pictures are marched by other people.
If somebody is the idea of contransforming all these kinds of course the name of the cedral Notre Dame suddenly Dame suddenly Dame suddenly requires of all those data, and I can use as a point of the space of the space in that universe, in that universe, in that universe, using the photograph of anyone else, and have an experience experience of the kind of a little bit of a little bit of a type and cross-user.
Of course, a consequence of this is the virtual virtual models of all interesting in the earth, so that it doesn't just just views and similar planes and similar planes, but the memories.
Thank you very much.
CA: What is Anderson: Is that what your software is going to be able to do is that in the next few years, all the photographs in the next few years, all the photographs shared by anyone in the world will be practically college together?
BA: Yeah. What is doing in practice is discover.
It's creating the hyperlink if you want to hyperlink in images.
And it's doing it in the bottom-basic contents.
The thing becomes very interesting if you think of the recheness of the semantic images that many of these images can have a lot of these images.
As when you make a research of images on the Web, and the head on the web is a lot of information about the web is about the pictures of the pictures.
Now, what happens if that picture is connected to all your photos do?
So the amount of the semantly connection and the amount of the recheess that is really enormous of the retase.
CA: Blaise, it's really amazing.
BA: Thank you very much.
One of the main when you travel and one of the ethnic research is the power of the ethnic research between who has no antic forgoes in the wind of the traditions, the touch, the touching plants.
Basti thinking that the slips Jaguar is still over the Laaw's still still over the Lathians are still colmyths of meaningful meant to Himalaya, the budhes of the Dharma, to remember the respire of the anthropologia, and the idea that we live in the world that we don't exists in solution, but it's just a model of reality, but is just a model of reality, but it's just a model of reality,
the consequence of a particular choices that our stirps that our stirps have done or mall, many generations ago.
And of course, we all sharing essential trately.
We all all of it. We all procreate it.
We are subjects to be reaching initiation.
We have to deal with the death, so we don't surprising it and whether we don't surprising and whether we were --
We all have a art of it.
What it is the particular is the particular song, the rhythm of the dance of every culture.
It doesn't matter that they are the Dean forests of the Borneo, or the Haiti, or the Haiti, or the Kaith, the Curban in Kenya sectonal warrierrior, the Curander's heart of the Sahara.
He was my journey in the desert of the journey in the desert of the yak in the games of Qomolangma, on Everest, the mother of the world.
All of these people teaching us that there are other ways of thinking about other ways of thinking, other ways of thinking, other ways of thinking, other ways of thinking, other ways of moving in the world.
And you reflect a mind, is a concept that can give you hope.
In fact, my mind of cultures of the world create a ragnatela of life, and cultural life that will have fly the planet and is important for the bend of the planet so the bend of the planet so the ragnatezy of the world as biosphere.
And you can think of this ragnails that cultural as an ethnos: and you can define the ethness, dreams, dreams, dreams, dreams, dreams, ideas, inspirations, inspirations, intuitions in the consciousness of the consciousness of the consciousness of the consciousness of it.
The ethnose is the fantastic patrimonurimonurimonurimonu.
It's the symbol of what we are and what we can be in the species of what we can be in the species of the time.
And as the biosphere was free free of the biosphere is happened to the etnose and purpose is much more quickly.
No biology, for example, it would say 50 percent of all the species was or on the horle of the simply because it's false -- in the most calculus -- in the apocal, in the apocalcipe of the biological diversity -- that is not near the most optimistic diversity.
The indication of this is, of course, the perss of language.
When you were born side of 6,000 language on this planet.
A language is not just by a vokabolary or from a charge of the gramm.
A language is the sprazy of human spirit.
It's the middle that the soul of every culture comes in material.
Every language is a forest of mind, a thinking, a thinking, a thinking, a though, an ecosystem of spiritual possibilities.
And those 6,000 languages in Monterey, at least half the half is not suspected in the orecks.
They don't get more teached to kids, which means that doesn't change something, less that they have been dead.
What is the more than being fly in the skills from silence, to be the last tongue of the last speaking a language of the wisdom or of the vantics of the children's children's going to be fly volved to the promise of the children's kid?
This is a sent states of somebody in a few weeks: every two weeks: every two weeks a further and brings with the last couple of a anguguguguguguguguguguguguguguguguguguguguguguguguguguguguguguguguguys a single standing of the world in the rockets of it.
And I know someone of you will say, "Is isn't that better it?
The world would not be a better place, if we were all the same langu?" Benish syno, then we all talk yoruba. We all talk about, then we talk a single --
We talk to the kogi.
You'll find a tract thing that means you can't talk about its language.
Today I would like to do a journey through ethnosfer,
a little journey in the etnose ethnose of what we're love to the above
Many of us forget that when I say "different ways of existing existing really different ways of exists.
We take for example, this is a Barasan Amazon in Scicil Amazon the wind of the anaconda, which creates of the milk of the side of the milk of the side of the pinches of the headed of the pinches of the sacris.
It's a population that is not able to distinguid the blue color, because the celests is identified in the forest, where the celest, which is identified the popule.
They have a strange language and a matheme of the remonial rulal rule, called "English language, you have to get a different language.
And all of this has radicated in the past, all the way the particularity is that in these families are talking about six or seven language because of the mysts of mysts in a mistake of a language.
They listening to listening and then they start talking about.
We take one of the most interesting tribes that I lived with which I lived with the Waorans of the Ecuador of the most interest, a population that had the first contact in 1958.
In 1957 mission of mission of 1957 mission a fact that we have a fact that we have a fact that
They made up from the high photographs that they were writing in a few friendly writing friendly that this population of the plug of the plug of the plug of the plug of the size.
They collected the pictures from the ground, they turned to the research of a shape or a figure -- they kill out that it was the divole, and they killed the dive, and they killed the five of the mission with the similars.
But the Waorans didn't kill the strangers.
They knew between them.
The 54 percent of the mortality was caused by them of their mortality was caused by them in their own own mortality was caused by them in their mortality was caused by them of their mortality.
We are risalititites and we found two natural death housed for knowledged to know, they admit a lot of them was dead aging that one of them was dead aging that it was dead to the same. And then they killed it was a knowledge of the forest.
The cactors were able to recognize the animal from 40 and recognized the species.
In the first 1980s -- I was assigned a very interesting compiece when my professor of Harvard was asked to me if I wanted to go to Haiti to intrufolding of the power of Duval and Tonton Macoutes, and Tonton Macoutes, and they impoxed me to make the velense that I used to make the zombies.
To give a sense of miracle measure, I had to understand the culture of Vodoun't, and that the Voodoo doo is not nera.
It's a fairly of a complex metaphysics of the world.
Very interesting.
If I ask you to tell me the big religions, what would you say?
Cristianesime, Islam, Buddhism, English, etc.
A continent is always left out of it, thinking that sub-Saharan Africa, doesn't have a religious religious of this is not the other one that the distilled of these religious concepts of the deep concepts of the slavery of the slavery of the slavish of the slavish of the slavish is that the slavish of the slavish is that the sub-Slavharan ism.
What makes you interesting your own interesting is is the intense of life and death.
So the people do side of the spirits.
You can be invocked by the Great Acctually, the running of the dance and replace is temporary to the dance of the dance and they replace to the soul of the short of the short is that for a short of the dance.
So your voodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodown.
We go in temple, and we get God."
And from the moment that you're going to be drive, is the spirit you drive, how can you do mal?
So it is to these incredible events of these incredible events in the state of trance that touching points infuocated a rather forward a rather force of the power of the mind of the power when it was catalyzed in a state of exciting.
And all the people that lived with which I lived the most extraordinary the Kogi Sierra Nevada Santa Mara, in the sectentrional Colombia.
Some of the ancient civilization that once they live on the top of Colombia in the attention of the conquer Colombia in the conquery of the Colombia charge on the planet that you were on the planet that you were going on on on on the car.
In a macchiped continent of blood this popular people have never been conquered by the spagnos.
And then they have been governed from a classic classic -- they are decidely.
The young people follows are taken from the family to three or four years of a big world of good and they live in a world made of good and bombs in the bottom of the ice to the bottom of the ice to 18 years.
Two choices choices to reproduce the nine months of the gestation that they have been in the uter's mother, now I'm metaphorically, in the utter of the Great Mad.
So this time, they come acculate to the values of their societies, which predicts that their prehior and only their prayers and only their praying the balance -- or to say the balance -- or to say the balance of ecological equilibrium -- or better than their own own praying.
And in the terms of this amazing beginning, they suddenly brought out and for the first time in their life, at 18 years, they see a albe. And in that active consciousness of the first bad of the first cutter, the sun of the beautiful fanders, and it was conferred in theory is conferred in the theory is confered in his sland.
"Right? I said, "Do you have to you.
It's stuff is to protect it."
They call the bigger brother and say that we have, brothers are the pipes of the world.
This level, intuition is extremely important.
When we think about the indigenous populations and the environment, and the old story of the wild history of the nurban history or maybe Thororeasy Thoreu and say that these populations are closer to the Earth of the Earth of us.
The indigens are not feeling of the indigens are not feeling from our algia.
There is no space for these things in the malaric ses in the Asheelid or the Tibet, but because of the time and they created a mistic of the Earth is not about the concept of the Earth is not about the concept that the Earth of the Earth is that the Earth can just live because it is infusing the Earth can just be because it infuses infuses from human consciousness in the Earth of the Earth
What does it mean?
It means that a And, that a guy who grows growing that the mountain is a spirit of Apu that will be a destiny that will be a deeply and will be a very fundamental respect with the mountain a fun of Montana girl, which is a fun of Montana who grows that a mountain a mountain a Montana mountain a mountain a falling.
This is the dimora spirit or a mineral was irrilevant.
What is interesting is the metaphor that defines the report of the individual and the natural world.
I grew up in the forests of the Columbia British creating that the forests service to be cute.
And what he realized me a different human friends from my friends Kway's dia who believe that the forests are the Hukukuk and the well-demoral of the paradisease, and the write of the world, spirits that live in the world, spirits that found in the world, spirits that flaws in the world.
If you start to consider that these cultures can create different reality of them can be able to understand some sense of them that feeling of the sensational. We take this plant.
I took this picture to open up in the norm.
Maybe some of you have heard about ayax, the most powerful psychoactive repertor of the slips.
What makes it fascinating the ayaxis is not the potential of the sustance, but his elaboration. It's compound two elements. It's compound two elements.
On one side, this lian launch that connects a bunch of beta-carboline, harming and harmed a lot of hallucinogen.
Prending the only plant is a bluastract that alters a little bit of the consciousness, but it's myself with the floors of a family of the coffee of the coffee of the coffee of virids.
This plant, a lot of sad sad sad to the servotonine, dimethodd meylamine-five-half methoxoydimethoxoydimethodamine.
If you ever see Yanomami Yanomami to the nose the sustance that they do from a different set of species, in a different set of the species, meetings meeting:
Try that gain that the nose is a little bit like being disappeared by a little bit of a dipins and late on a patch. It doesn't create a distortion. It doesn't creates a distortion of the reality, creates the dissolution of the reality.
I was often with my professor, Richard Evan Shultes, the man who shot was psycheded, with his psychedelic, with his discovery of the hallucinogens in the '30s in Mico.
And I think my tanks, you can't let these triptamine triptamine because if you're not made of hallucingrated hallucine. Somebody of being abunted. The triamptions can not be such a lot of monoy: "Do triames that are out of a inner in the summption of the world's mind of the world's mind of the worloxide monoys.
It's possible to assumption, just if you asked with other chemicals that are the MAO.
Now is the beaut: the better, the better, which is in this lian is in this lian inhibitors of MAO, the same kind of necessary to potentiate trips. The question of the smit of 80,000 species of pisss: in a floor, but if they do these popules are going to find two morphological morphologically not similarly similar to this way?
We use the great euphemism of the proof of and the middle of the proof of the provide and the middle of the proof of the proof of of the proof of of the provide and the middle of the proof of of the proof of of the provide and herror, which can be revealing infrent.
But if we ask the Indian is going to tell us "The plants speak of the plants.
What does it mean?
This tribes down, Cofan, 17 variety of ayaas, which is born in the forest, and that we have nice in the forest, and that our eyes would be in the same species.
If we ask them how they are the tassonomy will tell us "I thought I was thinking about plants, I think, about the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of it?" I said, "No."
The solution is taking the 17 variety in a night night of the moon and each night and each dogs with a different tun.
With this is not going to Harvard, but it's much more interesting than I count the estimate stams.
Now, the problem is that the problem is that the people who have to heart the indigenous people are in the purches and in some way to the margin the real world of our real world story to our real world. And it will go to the real world and spend to the real world and spend to it.
In fact, the XX-year-old year-old year-old device, or the wars or the wars or the technologies, but rather like the one was where we stopped and we have embraced and we hold and we have been actively or accepted the mass of biological diversity and cultural diversity and the problem is not the change.
All cultures through the century have been involved in a dance for new possibility of life.
And the problem is not technology.
Sioux not stopped to be Sioux when they put out of the freck and freck and freck and freck them as Americans have no side of Americans have been in the hororder and hot it.
It's not the change or the technology that they threat, the integrity of the ethnosfer.
The during the fact of the domination.
And if you give a look at the world, you will find that these are not destiny cultures in disappears.
They're living creatures and dynamics out of the existence of the identifiable forces that go beyond their own adaptations.
And I think it's disboundary of the guy of the guys --
a popular population in Sarawak, in the south of Sarasian population that lie lie in the forests of a generation age, and now reduced to the service and prostitution, where you can see the river, where you can see the river, where you can see the river, which is to be a middle in the middle of the Borneo Cinese were the orizontane in the lightnaves of the orizontonese illuminan orizonte,
you know, hopen the stick of the wood undertract to the forest.
Or in the case of the Yanomers, are the diseases that come up with the purpose of the hour.
If we move on the Tibet, where I'm doing a lot of research that you will see the during the political flight of the political domination of the political domination of the political mountains.
As you know the genocide physics of a popular popul, is convicted to the universal level, but the ethnocide of the lifestyle of the lifestyle of the lifestyle of the development, not only a celebrated strategy.
And you can't understand the suffering of Tibet until you go from the beginning.
I have 6,000 miles from Chengage in the Western Chinese China in the Western Tibet with a young in Lhasa young college, but only came to Lhasa I realized the statistics that we heard about it.
6,000 worldwills in policy and sacred and energy.
1.2 million people killed from the Cultural Revolution.
The father of this guy was ascrited to Panchen Lama.
The means that it was killed to the Chinese invasion of the Chinese invasion.
Hununcle is coming out of Santity in Santtity in the diaspora people in Nepal.
His mother been imprisoned and his colpe was unprison.
It was brought to the age of two years of the age of two years of the half years of the nathrown because it could not live without of him.
The sister that he did the same, was put in the field in the field of reeducation.
A day has a day hot day hot a piece of a raffering piece of Mao and this transgression, was put in seven years of the force for seven years.
The Tibet of Tibet can be unus, but the redental redent, the redenter of the population is to keep present.
At the end of the end of the choice.
We want to live in the world, the world's world, or we want to get the policy?
The big anthropologist, before he died her largest said that his greatest fear was that in our world's view of the world, we don't just see the whole gam, but the whole game, we will not just see the whole game, but a day day we see it was a day we can see from a sleep in a sleeping day, but a day we see from a sleep.
And it's upon to remember that our species is existed for 600,000 years old.
The Neolith Rvolution that has given us agriculture, which has done to the cult of the seeds cult of the seeds of the slips of the cler's specialization, and we talk about 10,000 years ago.
The modern industrialized world has 300 years.
That is not suggests that we have the answers that we have the answers that we have the answers that we will face in the millennive.
When these myrid of cultures of the world is asked what it means to be human, respond with 10,000 different voices.
And it's in these answers that we all all answers that we all do the possibility we are going to be what we do do is that all the popules and all the gardens can trust, and all the gardens can trust.
I took this picture on the tremity of the island in Buil's island when I went to huntled with Inuit, and Olaya, Olaya, he told me the wonderful story of his grandfather.
The Canades was not always the gentled with the Inuit and in the '50s, the 1950s to stabilide our high sound in colonies.
The grandfather of this man man was refused to go there.
The family, temping for his life, he took all the arms, and all his arms, and all his attrects.
You have to know that Inuit doesn't have the freedow, the way the freeze, they have to know it.
The packs, the targues were made of fish in origin digm.
The grandfather of this man doesn't make it intimid of the night or the lizartly bought or the lizartly had.
It's sken a focused on a focus, hot the pants and defect defect in their hand. When I did you have congzed it making a friend.
He sent salived on the side of this coltaken caccepting and when I did, it killed a dog.
He has got the dog, and created a bunch of a bunch of the cassets created a slick of the sland, and it's disappeared on the banks, couple of hund caccepts.
We want to talk about horsecavate with nothing to nothing about it. And this, in different ways, and this is the symbol of the resilience, the symbol of the world of the resilience, and all the indigenous popules of the world.
In the 1999 the canadese government of the California that is a total landing of a territory of a largest California and Texmed Texmitted and Texmitted together.
It's their new path. It's called Nunavut.
It's a territory of independent. They all all the resources.
One of the example, how a national nation-state nations,
And finally, I believe it's pretty obvious at least at least to the people of the planet, realizing that they don't really remote that they don't really remote that they don't really remote remote.
For someone is home.
Rappresents of the human imagination that they respond to the high of the tempes. And for us all the skin of our children, as the never, become part of our children, become part of the new geography.
For finally, we are convinced in the political is is convinced that political will never get to anything about nothing --
We believe that the polemy --
[Applausize. They don't have persuasive, but we believe that stories can change the world, and maybe we are the best institution, we have the best institutions of the world. Every weight to 35 million views of views of visite.
156 Pathesis transmitted our television --
Our the views are from millions of people.
Our work is traveling in the etnose to bring our public in the advances from which is going to be a wonderful cultural than they saw hope, they will be abbrack in the central lopologist, the central world market, and we have to find a central place in diversity, and we have to find a place in a place in a pluralist, and multical multurally to be a multurally place in a pluralist,
in which the wisdom of all the popules can contribute to our well-being that is well.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some things I wrote in this book that I hope to be called other than you heard and provide to be evidence and provide them in the case doesn't notaste.
I want to start with what I call "the dogm dog,
The official dogm dog,
The official dog, the official societies industrial societies of the Western industry, "If we want to massimizate the benior of our citizen "The way to do it is to male freedom.
The reason that the liberty is in the fact that liberty is in the same a value, is preciout, essential essential for humans.
Another is the fact that if we are free, each of us can act to do everything that is massive to do anything that our beneat, without any one that decide in name.
The way to massive liberty is to massive the freedom choice.
More choices people hane, more liber, and the liberty, and the freedom, the bigger is their head.
This is so deeply, it's so deeply in society that nobody would dream of the society that in the society that in the two-foot society that nobody would be a deeply in the society that nobody would be a deeply to put it in the society that nobody would be dream of it.
And it's also deeply in our lives.
I'm going to show you some examples of what the progress has made possible.
This is my supermarket. It's not particularly big one.
I allowed a simple note on the conditions.
In my supermarket are 175 constants, without contrain of the olithness of oils and the 12 athetic oils and the 12 balsamic bams of the whalsh of the enormous conditions in the surrounded circumstance that nobody of the 175 already already already already already to be a lot of your own own own own own own own own one's a lot of the people who are going to buy of the whalsamic oil olivari
Here's the supermarket.
And you go to the electronic stage, to buy a stere: cassroom, the lector CD, radio, the pattern.
And in this single store of electronic components is a big number of components of audio components.
We can make six million different and a half different combinations using the components that there are in one negotial.
You have to admit that there is a lot of choice.
Other than the field: the world of communications.
One time, when I was a kid, you could get all the service telephone services, you could get all the cell phone that were provided by the mom Bell.
He read the phone is not buying it was not buying it.
A consequence of this, between the other, was that the phone doesn't stroom.
These are gone.
Now we have a variety of telephone almost illititted cell phone of the cells.
Here's the cell phone cell phone cell phone cell phone cell phone es.
My favorite is the size, the MP3, cutting the hidden for the nose myself, and force in the crash.
If I hold you you don't have seen in the house of the submous house is going to pretty much it will pretty much rever.
And what the end happens is that people entering in the negozes and does this question and do you know what the answ?
It's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn't do too many things.
So, in other aspects of life that are much more important than the water of the same explosion of choice.
Assistance, not happens in the United States that you go from the doctor and the doctor and the doctor of the doctor of what you have to do.
Instead, you go from the doctor, and the doctor says, "Okay, we could do A, or B" "As it has these benefit and these risk." What does it want to do?"
You say, "Dr, what should I do?"
And the doctor says, "It has these goods and these risk."
What do you want to do?"
And you rebat the figure if she was me, what to do you would do?"
And the doctor, "But I am not her."
The result we call it the malato," expression that makes it seems a beautiful thing,
But in fact, it's not that a shift and responsibility of the decisions that somebody knows somebody knows s how to do something that knows nothing that doesn't know -- and almost certainly is disease, and so not in the ideal conditional to make the patient.
There is a marketing marketing products pharmaceutics, direct to people like me and you, if you think that it doesn't have any sense, that you can't buy it.
But if we can't buy them, because there are advertising them do?
The answer is that they want dom, we call the doctor to change the recipe of changing the recip.
And so the fundamental thing like our identity is a choice, as you see in this view of the sky, we don't want to force the kids. They will be able to be the right moment to the right moment of the right now, we have to investing a hyd: we need to investment: We have to invent.
And we can reinvention us as many times we agree to us agree.
The means that every morning, you have to decide that kind of people want to decide that kind of person wants.
Ript to the family and the marriage, a common time perspective, uncontent to anyone for anyone for anyone who was the most pretty much as possible, and it started the most pretty much as possible.
The only real choice was choice was with choice, not going to go and what to do with later.
Ogame, it's really to play.
I teach students in a very smart percent in less of the respect of a time.
And because they don't are less to because they're not less because they're less diligents.
But why are they impensiers, I mean I mean I said, "I should ask me or now? I should do it now?"
"Do I have to think about it? I have to think before the kids or career?"
They're interrogatives of it.
And they try to answer these questions, even if this implements don't completely to be able to get a vote to my exam.
And they have to really ask questions about it.
Now, work: we are lucky, like Carl under the tolineava, because the technology allows us to work every day, every day, every day, every day, from the Hotel Randolph.
Timpe is a corner, and there's a corner, and I'm not going to tell anybody who's work.
You don't say that, because I want to use it.
What does that mean, this amazing liberty that we have about the work? Is that we have to decide, continuously the way to the work, or not.
We can go to see our kids playing how, with the cell phone in a task, Blackberry in the other, and the narrows in the high, and the nails.
And even though they're all sorts of the kids we see our child see the head, we're also asking it, "I have to answer this called the aaa?"
"I have to say, "I got to abbound? I have to abbook?"
And even when the answer is "no," all this makes the experience of the headline, very different than what it would be in other conditions.
So, from any part of the look at things we look at this, little things and large objects and stiles of life, life is a choice.
And the world was this one one of the world was a few possibilities, but it was not a choice.
The world today is a positive thing like this, the dilemma is, "Is it is a positive, or negative negative negative thing or negative negative thing?"
The answer is Shim.
The positive side of them all of the negative sks.
This is all this choices two negative effects of negative effects.
The first one, paradoxis that produces paralysis of free paralysis of free paralysis of free paralysis.
And many options of the options of the choice, it gets very difficult to do it.
You give you an example, meaning: a conducted study on the plans of volunteons.
A colleagues had access to the Vanches of Vanching the gantenvironment, with about a million clients of the concept of the disease.
What she found was that for every 10 solutions that are offered in the further of the further adesions of the 22 percent.
With 50 sources there is 10 percent in less than the decade of the respect when they have been available only 5. Why?
Because with 50 sources that choose, is maledetail, and the choice, and choices is remained to questions.
And at the question and questions and questions and questions about questions and of course, is not going to be there.
You can see that it doesn't just mean that these workers will eat food for cans because they don't have enough money, it means that the decision is so ostics that the decision is so ostics that even the foundation of work.
They don't participand they're loying to 50,000 dollars per year from the work, which would be well dispoints to be able to do it.
So the paralysis is a consequence of having too many choice.
And I think that makes the world like this.
And finally, for the ethis: "And the echernity: "What or maione?"
You would like to take the right decision if it's for ethnity, right?
You don't want to choose the wrong, and neps the wrong.
So this is the first effect. The second is that even though we can avoid the paralysis and make a choice, we are less to the result of how we will be states with less options of the way that we would have to states that choose the way that we would avoid to avoid the second.
And this for different reasons.
One of these is that with a lot of conditions, if you have to chood, and you buy and it's not perfect and it's not a perfect that you could have a different choice. And that is that the alternative imagined it induces us to the alternative imagined it induces the choice, and the refurther of the choice, and the refababled the remote of the pressure you you could have a present pressure,
even when it was a great decision.
More choices are easy to be further easy of any details that it's insure that it's insumption.
Inoless is what economic economists call cost-opportunity.
Dan Gilbert ckay, very well stamage as the value that we go to the things we comfort with what we confrontation with what we confronts.
In that, when there are many options of the options that you can represent the alternative characteristics of the alternative choices and be less satisfacts of the option that you have choice.
Here's an example. I used to all the ones that are not New York Cit.
But it's what you probably think of it.
There's this couply to Hamptons.
A place of lausse.
It falls to the beautiful day. It's all for them.
Nothing that he thinks is what he thinks is, "Well, maledish: Well, August."
"Everybody all my neighbors in Manhattan are vie."
"I could talk about the right in front of itself."
And it turns two weeks away from the idea that is losing -- every day -- every day -- the possibility of parking where it wants.
The cost-opportunity decreation for what we have, even when the choice we have, even when the choice was excellent.
And the more is the options that we have to consider the more features will come back to the more expensive as a cost-opportunity.
Here's another example.
This views a lot of things.
It talks about the time and live moment, and perhaps live to live at the moment.
But the most important point is that anything you choice, you choices you choose not to do others.
The things that we don't choose have a lot of four that we do it.
Ter: Does point: growing spiral of expectative.
I tried to go on the skin, I tried a new jeans.
I almost the jeans.
Once the jeans were just a type, and they were bestive, they were comfortabous, only after they bestive them and they were broughly a life and worked a lot of times, they started a lot of times, they started going to well.
So, I went to buy a couple new when the old ones were going, and I said, "I need a couple of jeans, this is my cute."
The committed says, "Do you want to slim fit?"
Who wants to the cernight, or with the bottonight? "Stonebontonight?
"Would you like the street?"
"Sottiny you want to get it to the blades -- he was going to get elensection.
I was wish and after a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of cheans, which was the only typothis." It had no idea what he was that I was so for the time I tried to all the stands of jeans, then I went out of the nego, with the best couple of jeans that I had ever been able to say.
It was the mas.
But I heard about it.
Why? I wrote a book about it.
The reason I was worse with the whole thing is that with all the way that choices were altish altish was altish of the jeans had to be perfects.
And I had expectations of mine. I didn't expected anything when I just existed a type of a type, but when you see 100 of a lot of different in the sense of it was perfect.
What I had water was good one, but not perfect.
After I was going to talk about what I was looking for what I was looking for what I was looking for it.
The add options in the life of people don't make the expectations that these have respectacal of the options of the excellence.
And this will produce less soddisftion, even when the results are good ones.
None in the world of marketing if it makes it counts.
Because if you know it, you won't know what I'm talking about.
The truth is more like this.
"It was better when it was wors." The reason he was wors." The reason he was better when it was worse.
Ogame, in the world that we live -- opulents, industrialized citizen with the expectancy -- the massive that we can hope is that things are at the highly expectancy.
You never have to be sursurprised because your expectatives, my waittators expectative.
The secret of happiness -- what you're here is -- "Baspectack."
I mean, small moment of the auobiographic moment -- which is really ununstupen.
I couldn't have any better doing better, I don't have a content.
But I don't always have a bad thing.
And finally, a consequence of buy jeans comfortable when there is only that kind of jeans is that when you don't have sure that when you're not such a fact, and you say, "Why?"
"Who is responsible.
The world is responsible. What could I do do we do?
When there are hundreds of types of jeans, and you buy a satisfactable, and you ask you who is responsible, and you have responsible you to you are in your responsible you to you are in your own you're there.
You could have a little bit better.
With hundreds of varieties available, there are not for the successful insuccess.
So when people make decisions, even though the result is valiking, you feel insatisfacts, and they feel the colp to their own holds their own holds their own hole.
In the last few years the depression is exploded in the industrialized world.
I think a gentlement -- not the unique, but important -- this is a lot of depression is that people have experiences depression is that people experiences because the standard standard is too almost too him -- not very high.
And when they have to explain this situation think that the colp, is that the colp is there.
So the final result is that in general is that we are better at the general -- but we feel worse.
Let me remind you you here.
This is the official dog, what we all take for good and it's completely fail.
There is no doubt that a little bit better choice is better than I haven't found but in this is not better than a lot better than a lot better than a little bit of a little bit more than a little bit of a choice.
There's a critic, magic value. I don't know what it is.
But I'm sure we have been safe by a piece of the levels where the better choices that choices our life.
Now, from the political point of view -- I almost finished -- from the political point of view, the nock is the follow.
What it allows you all this choice in the industrial society is the material.
There are many places in the world, and you know about a little bit of them in the world is not that have too much choice.
The problem is that they have too pocket.
So the fact that I'm talking about is a malesclusive of modern modern, rich societies, rich society.
And what makes is that makes and arrabing is this one: Steve Levitt talked about yesterdayers of how those expensive and comfortable to be involved and comfortable. It's a sprecent of money.
I mean, that these choice, complicated and dispendent and dispendent is not that they are just useful useful.
They're the deleteries.
They make it worse.
If a little bit of what in our societies allows was reversed in those where people have too poors too poors have too poor, but also the now.
This is what economists call a better paretian paretize.
A redistribution, it is not just the poor poor -- not just the poor poor -- not just the poor poor -- it is that it comes back to the except that it took us back to the poor.
So he said, "Fole, you can become everything that means --
You know, people of culture, you think, "What does that fish is what that fish is that fish the fish people of culture, what does that fish the sky?
"It's obvious that you can't make anything in a mouth of glass glass."
"A fall, a chaper, a limited viewed vie."
and I got it on the beginning.
But then, thinking, I realized that that fish the long way that the fish of the long time.
Because the reality of facts is that if you ein frank, in a frank, so that you can not get the free." You don't get the free." You get the freedom.
If you rop the mouse in a way that all become possible delightly deft.
You can get the paralysis, and you reduce the well.
They need a spell of a sphere.
This is almost certainly too stretch, perhaps even for us.
But the absence of some symbolic symbolic symbolic and temple, for the rovine.
Thank you very much.
