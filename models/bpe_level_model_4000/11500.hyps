The year I showed these slides to show that the smother's paper that the scap of the 48 America's size of 48 U.S. has been stretch of 48 U.S. continents, is restretch of the 40-8-40-percent.
But this under-defined gravity of the problem because it doesn't show the ice of the ice of the ice problem because it doesn't show the ice of the ice problem because it doesn't extend of the ice problem because it doesn't show the ice of the ice of the ice problem because it doesn't show the ice of the ice problem because it doesn't show the ice of the ice of the ice problem because it is not spring.

You can see the ice ice ice ice ice ice -- five years or more than five years or more than here is the body.
In 25 years is spent from this way to this.
This is a problem because the re-scale problem with the ice of the ice of the ocean artical except where there are enormous amount of carbon that microbic is that they get into the microbies.
And in the total of the totality of the atmosphere from the global scale of global warming, that amount of not released this point of not to reach that point of not release.
In some deep lages in Alaska is already rebodied by water.
The professorse Katey Walter of the University of Alaska was with a very low-low-based lake lake a low-low-based lake --
Video: Wow! Gor: Lake is if we're going to be the question is if we're going to be the us.
A reason is that this scale scale of the East Groenland,
This is a faid record of the English actical record.

This is the Kangerlussuather Kangerlussuaer of the Groenlusher of the Groenlussia.
If you want to know how the level of the sea ice of the ice of ice ice on the group, here is where the mart.
These are increasing are increasing very quickly.

The environmental disasters are increase out of the normal and without preedents.
Four time time you have in the last 30 years that we have 75.
This is a genter of all insustainable.
If you look at the context, you can see the consequences.
In the last five years we added 70 million tons.
Look at the areas of the Pacification of the Amer, to the Amer, and on the parts of the subject parts of the subject of the subject of the oxygene in the ocean ans.

The oil is a problem, and the carbon is even worst st worst of it.
The United States are one of the two countries with the Cina.
And he propond of building a lot of carbon die.
But we're assisting a change change of direction.
These are the projects of the last few years and some proposes of alternative proposes.
And every way, there's a political lots in our country.
The carbon industry and oil has spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promoting the carbon the top of the carbon is a bought to promotly.
And this image image is a --

If you want to go back to the hand go together.
We have to go back to the speaking --
Thank you very much.
The year at TED TED 10 10 10 to be a LHC.
And to go back to the machine.
So here is the other time you don't have to get the other time you don't have to be the most great experiment, or ever tried -- 27 miles of circumst.
His to reach the conditions that were present at least a billion billion to be a second from the beginning of the universe -- until 600 million times at the second to 600 million times at the second to 600 million times at the second of the beginning of the universe --
And that's all the environment.

This is a picture of an ATLATLAS in building so you can see the proportions.
The 10 sectors last year we have access the machine for the first time.
And this picture was taken from ATLATLAS.
It was because of immense in the healthcare of control in the healthcare of control.
This is a picture of the first fashion particles that had done the LHC, enter entertain a part of LHC, and spreading particularly particularly particularly particularly particularly particularly particles.
In other words, when we see that image the 10 sector, we understand that the machine is a great liver lives.
I don't know if it was this to do more opposed to do that when somebody went to Google and the pay was this:
That means we had a cultural impact on the scientific impact on the scientific impact on the scientific impact on the scientific impact on the scientific impact on the scientific impact on the scientific impact on the scientific impact of the scientific impact on the scientific impact impact on the scientific impact of the scientific impact.
And so so this is a week with the machine -- this is a problem with the machine here -- these films here -- these films here -- these films -- these films -- these films -- these films of the machines here -- these films -- these films of the machine here -- these films here -- these films of the machines here -- these films here -- these films of the machines here -- these films of the machines here -- these films of this -- these phildors.
These films are 13,000 prints when the machine works, we could be the masside-of the powerful powerful works.
Now, the technical technical technical and did, "It's not true. I'm a film."
And instead of it because they are very fredition to become the cosident cosident pherses.
So, at least 271 degrees, a temperature temperature in the space, these films can bring that current to the current of the room can bring that current to the current of the space.
In one of the most of the most of the most of the LHC, there was a dift of fabrication.
So the filmes are surprising and 13,000 feet and 13,000 amps of suddenly meet a resistance of electricity.
This was the result.
Now, this is still more impressive than 20 tons if you think these magnets, and you have been slowed about 30 centimeters.
You are dannels about 50 magnets.
We had to take them to the things that we did it.
We have the repristined and justed and justed the off.
Now they're going to be return all to their place.
I actually went to the LHC will be new inteam.
And I acceness, and we expect to get the right or him, and continue so our adventure or him, and continue so our available to find what the universe.
Now, of course, in a way, these are reacting the debate of the debate on the value of science and engineering of science and engineering of the engineering of the confiding.
I think the fact that it's so difficult to go beyons, I think this is the value of things like LHC.
I want to conclude with the words of a scientist Ingland, Humphrey Davy, the qual, image, imaginy, the qual, image, and unfortune Farady, and his pupill, and he said, "Niman is a Michael Farady, said, "Nidient is so dangerous of the human mind of the remarkable of the human remarkable to nature that we have to be a tried to be a tried by the degrees of the conversation of the concerned --
Thank you.
I want to start asking you to rethink about how to do that, as you play in the morning.
And as you can understand how to get them and to get them and move them and to get them and to be able to think and solve problems and to resolve problems and a space.
The only is a spective space, so so we understand the way we understand the world around us.
So, by inforce that we use of our interaction with the useful objects with the several consult of my Pac, and my collaborator, and Jeevan Kalanithi, I started asking heroes that we have a computer, instead of having the cursor of the remarkable to be the relled of the camera that you could be a information that you could be a information with a information that will be a information to be a information with a several information with a information to be re-scale of the seseveral information to be the sent of the way to have a sesesesex, and the information that that that that that that that that that that you can can can can can can be be
and systems our please?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer, building Siftable.
In fact, a Siftable is a computer interactive computer as a great biquick as a biquick biquick as a biquick biquick is a very big computer biquick as a bisco.
In fact, a Siftable is a computer interactive computer as a great biquick as a biquick biquick as a biquick biquick is a very big computer biquick as a bisco.
You can move with the hands and you can see the hand it in them, and they feel the right movements and a radio wireless.
But most of course, they're objects like the morning, you can just move to the morning, you can just be affected to the stick of it.
The Siftable is an example of a new ecosystem for a new way to manipulate information technology.
And as they become more physics, conscious than the movement, and they get more physics, and they become more physics, and they become more physics, and they get more physics of the others, as we can explore new and function of the interaction of interaction.
He tried with some simple example.
This Siftable is configured to show of the video: if you can stand in a direction, the video ruoters out of the other part of the other part of the other part of the other part of the other part of the other part of the other part of the other part of the other part of the other part of the video.
These are interactive actished with others.
If you do it is interested in what it's their intort.
If they come to circumstes, you see a few things.
If they come to circumstes, you see a few things.
They also have their movements and linked them and line.
And we realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was the way to use the common data, to example of the data, as if it was a liquid.
In this case, we have three Sife configured as a several several sleep and I can use them to be in the middle in the middle in the middle of the color in the middle of the color in the middle of the color and I can use them to be able to be in the middle of the green and I can use them to be able to be a
and I can use them to be a central of the color in the central stand where they missed miles.
If we go too much of it, we can reach a little bit of place.
I'm also beautiful, and you can take the kind of languages, the mathematics and joys where people can try to try and see the things quickly things like and see the results.
Now I'm now --
This is a sequence of Fibonacy that I do with a equation of equations.
So here we have a words that is a half between Scarabeum and Boggle.
Orrically, in every turning of the saves in every Siftable, Pratically, in every turning of the same, and as you try to be a place on the Siftable, and while you try to a dictionary on a dictionary about a dictionary on a dictionary on a dictionary of the words of a pathy in in the Siftab
Then, after about 30 seconds of them and you have a new set of letters and new chance to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try
Thank you.
So here is how they came to the Media Lab, I made it in a way that I tried them and I went a video.
They are pleasure a lot of a lot of it.
And one of the interesting things of this kind of applation is that you can't give you a lot of the people in a lot of educational instruments.
You just say, "Compony of the words, and they know what to do.
So here is how to do it.
This is our betters young head, there to be young people in the street.
It was actually wanted to be a cities.
They are just morning, for him.
Now, this is an applation of a interactive carton.
We wanted to build a tool, for the ling's remarkable of the ling's Felix.
It can be able to new characters in the scale, the Siftable to the Siftable of their associated associated with them.
It can be able to new characters in the scale, the Siftable to the Siftable of their associated associated with them.
So, it's doing the sun.
Video: The sole is surgence.
David Merrill: Now it took a treator in the scene.
Video: The treator treatment.
Bel work!
So Siftable and you put the neighborhood can be the characters --
Video: Bau!
And by inventing its story.
Video: Ho!
DM: It's a story with final final initial story, and it can decide how you get it.
DM: It's a story with final final initial story, and it can decide how you get it.
Video: Vuly --
DM: The last example I have time to show you is a tool, to show you a remarkable to be recently and exeguing music.
It's a tool, made of recently recently to save and exeguing music.
The Siftable here are acting from souths like and bacteria --
Every one of these four variations, and you can choose which use.
You can insert these sounds in a sequence of your please.
And I just show you a sounds a sounds and a "sequence."
These are actually you can control from the living and the filmer and the films.
You attacks a particular sugars to the sought and then you start to address.
And then there are the general effects like time and fly and fly it into the inter-sequence.
Let's look like it works.
Video: DM: We will try to put a basis in two Siftable to sequences, we can be in a serious estendiding, we add other based on the other based on the extract of it.
Now I am a baby.
Video: DM: Now add percent use --
Video: And now I'll put the filter to the bacteria, so I can control the effect of the live.
Video: DM: I can speak the whole sequence of the time from a or from the other.
Video: DM: And now I add the bottom to give more expression.
Video: DM: I can recombining the sequence of the sequence "."
So I don't have to planned the first time, but I can suddenly drinking or more correct or more correct.
And now, finally, I can sfue the entire sequence of the left the Siftable to the Siftable to the Siftable to the Siftable to the Sift."
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is building new new new interfaces of men and more like how they work as our brains.
And today, I had time to show you one of the results of this lost and some chance to take out of the lab of the lab of the lab of the lab of the lab and a few chance of this loss of this loss of this loss of this loss of this loss.
The concept I want to transmit is that it's coming this new generation of objects that are going to be the digital media media that will be information in our world. In the way that we want to do it in the way we want to get this new way that we want to do with the world in the way we want to get this new generation of the world in our world.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the now of speak with all of you.
I'm a writing write e e writing.
And I want to be books is my professional exsion but it's more than that, of course,
It's also the love and the fall of my life.
And I don't expect that can change it.
But then, something particularly has been recently in my life and in my life and in my life and my career realibrate with this work.
The particular thing is that I was a very libe, this biography called "Mangia, Prega, Ama" the quality, Ama" the quality, and become a big conversation of the world and become a big biographic and become a big big sense, sense, but it became a big -- and it becomes a big remarkable of the world and become a big big remarkable of the world and become a big big remarkable of the world of my book,
And the result is that everyone is that everyone is that they were condanned to be as if they were condanned.
It is true -- condanned --
They are now all worried and say, "You don't get to papers and say, "You don't have to do better.
You don't have a paper, you can't write for all the life without able to create a book that can be able to create a book that can important to somebody?
that can important to somebody?
It's rassically, you know.
But it could go worst -- I remember that more than 20 years ago, when I began to say that people -- I was a writing -- I wanted to be a write write trick.
I went to the same reaction from the land.
And people say, "Don't be able to be able to have success?
You don't have a paper that the million-refied kill?
You don't have to do this mestive for all the life without that nose is ever out and die on a heart of the bock of the blood of local hands of the failing of the failed failing of fail?"
So, you know.
The answer -- the short response to all these questions is ""Yes."
Si.., I have a paper.
I had always paper.
And I also have a lot of other things that people can't be to be to be to be to be in it.
As the althese, and other things are spring.
But as I wrote what I thought I was thinking and I asked me to ask me about why is it?
Is it rational?
It's just just that anyone who who deal to be she'd be she'd be a work that you can get to do.
But what is that there is so particularly in previous imprese to the healthcare of the healthcare in a way that other careful careful way to do not do it?
As my father, for example, he was a chimical engineer and I don't remember one time in his 40 years of activity in which was asked if they were asked if they were asked if they were asked to be engineering to be engineering to be engineering to be engineering to be able to be able to be a chected to be able to be asked if they were asked if they were asked if they asked if they were asked if they were asked if they were asked if they were asked if they were asked
It was never -- that block of engineer engineer like ves?
It wasn't working as it work?
Onestly, the engineers as a group of chemicals like a group of secouraged to be alcouraged to be alcouraged to be alcouraged to you.
We wrote enough this reputation, and not just writers but creative writers but creatives of all these reputation of being enormous as well.
And it's not going to look at the tristand contact of the magnificent dead of the magnificent century that only in the 2th century, and often for them.
And even those who are suicide seem to be really discover from their women.
Norman Mailer, before I die in the last last last I was in the last book has killed a little bit more more extraordinary of the work of their life.
But we don't get to say why we heard that is because we heard these things so much as you know, we have completely interiorized and the notion that creative creativity and suffering are in a few way you wood, and the arm, to the end of the arm, to the end of the art, to the end up to the end of the art, and the art, and the art, and the art, and the end, and the notion is going to be in a few things like
And the question I want to bring to all of our today is you agree with this ide?
And it goes to you know this -- because you go from a centimeter to me not good for this supposition.
I think it's odiose.
And I think it's dangerous and I don't want to see the perpetuated in the next century.
I think it's better to encourage our great minds that creative is going to be a lives.
And I certainly as I was in my case -- in my case -- it would be very dangerous to be becoming up to that I was dark in my careful dry in my career.
Of course -- unfortunately, they're pretty young ans, I have about 40 years.
I still have about four decade in my work in me.
And it's very likely to be that everything else else else else will be right now in the world as the world as the work that used after my last book.
He just just slavery, because we all have more or less friends here -- is likely to my greatest in my shoulders.
Oh, Ges: What you think!
You know this is the gene of thinking that a person to start to be a band I don't want to do it.
I would continue to do this work we do.
So, the question is it be?
And so I was seeds, after a lot of reflection that the way to work is to write is to create a psychological property, right?
I had a few way to find a security of security between me, which I'm writing and my natural ansize, and my natural anside, and I was trying to get and look at the time, and I was trying to look at the time, trying to find other societies and see if they could have the time to look at the time, and to see if they could have the best ideas and more healthcare and more healthy and more healthcare and more healthcare of the things and better
as help people creative to manage the people creative risks of the creative risks of creative creative creative creative of creative creative creative and creative people to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to help the people creative res.
And that research me to the antics and anthrow and antic.
Seguitems because it is in the circle and then go back back back up.
In the Great and the Great and anics -- people didn't seem to believe that the creative creativity came to the men are yesterday of the men are yesterday of the man?
And it was thinking that creative was this spirit and they come to the men and who came to the men from a few men from a few of distant and unknown as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well.
The green was called these spirits of the spirits of the creative "demony."
Socrate, wonderful creates of having a demone that elargives from moon.
The Romans were the same idea, but they were called that sort of spirit without a genius gence.
The big thing is that big, because the Romans didn't think that a genius was a particular genius was a particular intelligent gene of it.
They believed that a genius was this sort of entity in the win the walls of the study of the study of a artist, a little like the elf of the artist and who came out of the artist and the work of the artist and the result of that works.
Ecceptional -- that is the distance of what I talk about the psychological psychological that protects protects of your work.
And all they knew that was so that it worked, right?
So the anti-old artists were protons of things, like for the example of the anti-house, right?
If your work was exceptional, you can't take all the deep and all of the deal that we were helped from this genius to be help.
If your work fail, it wasn't all colate -- right?
All they knew that was your genius to be a skill.
And so people han concept, the creative in Occident for a very time.
Then the Rincome and all the way and it is all the big idea, we put this great ide; we put the human beings and the mysteries and the mysteries and the mysteries that write is devvinced by device.
This was the principle, and people began to think that creative creative creativity was completely from the iron.
And for the first time in history, you start to refers this or that artist as a genius as a genius as a genius to a person with a genius of the genius of the genius to this or a genius to this or a genius in the story,
And I have to tell you, I think was a big mistake.
I think I can lose somebody, a person to believe that it's like a reciplent as the source and the surprising and the surprising and the mysterious of the mysterious and eterals are a right now.
It's like to ask someone to to be doing the sold.
I degree distores and creates all these ingestiable ingestive expectation on loloss.
And I think it's this pressure to have been a pressure in the past.
And, if this is true, and I think that is the question is, and it becomes down?
Can we do it different?
And as you go back to a understanding of the most antics of the relationship between humans and mystery creative of the relationship of the relationship of the relationship of the relationship between humans and mystery.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we can't get 500 years of thinking about 500 years of thinking about 18 minutes.
And there are people in the audience that would be a bond of the scientific scientific on the notion of the notion of the nice of the next projects of their projects.
And I probably won't be able to tell you all about this thing.
But the question I want to bring is -- why is why is it?
Why don't I think about this in this way?
Because it has more sense of any other thing that ever ever ever ever ever heard to explaining the extreme of the creative process of creative process.
A process that you ever tried to do something -- so so that it is -- so all here -- yet all here -- you don't behavior behaviors.
And, in fact, you can be completely paranorormal.
I did this recently with the Ruth Stone, which has now 90 years old, which is now 90 years old, but that was a few life and disse in his childhood in his childhood in the Virginia, and he was going to be in the Virginia, and the wall, in the field of when a poet-a-a-a-path-to-a-a-a-a-a-a-sced in the field of the field of the Virgini-year-old and and he was a
He said that was like a fragorous fragorous pheum.
And that was rotating to her papers from the land.
And it was going to be because he was going to take the earth under its feet.
He knew that you have one thing to do to do that point and it was like, "Who"
And so it goes to the house and came to the pathy and it wouldn't be able to get another piece of paper, and a pretty quickly fall of the train and a fall the way to the page, as the page.
Sometimes you can't be pretty quickly as it is and correct and correct and correct and the rouncles the rountoled and she was the rouncles through the pathy and she would continued to rotolating through the pathespecially as he said, "One of the other poet."
And then there were times -- this piece of not dement, I'm going to be -- there were moments in which was almost loss?
So, he was going to go home and the hand the hand the hand the deeper and the walk across the walk and then he said it was as if it was as if you were as if you get with the off.
And he was the cover the coda and the coda and the walls and the walls and the page.
And in these cases, the little bit of the perfect and inter it was perfect and intacts at the last word at the last word at the first word at the first word at the first word at the first word at the last word at the last word at the last word at the last word at the last word at the first word at the last word at the first of the last word at the first word at the first one of the first one of the first word at the first word at the last
So when I felt I felt -- it's just the fable, it's exactly the process of creative process.
Not all my creative process -- they're not a constructure.
I'm a mul, and my way to work is -- I sweet up to the same orary every day and go to the pass and go to the pass on the house.
But I even even even -- in my head -- I wrote on that conscious on the cosa, and you know,
And I guess that many of you have the han done.
You know, even if the work and ideas came to me from a certain source of the function of it doesn't even know it.
And what is this thing?
And how can we relate to us to do not to give us the head, pluttoo, which is that we do that?
And so as I think, the best example of the best example that I have is the music that I have is the musicist in Tom Waits, which I interview.
We were talking about that, and you know, Tom, for the most of life was the incarnation of the artist of the artist of the artist of the impull of impull impulsizing these species of impulsized.
But then invecked, you wood, and a day when he was driving the author in Los Angeles, it changed all for him.
He was going to go fast, and it was a little bit of this little framework of better, which comes into its head, and the desire and the desire, and the desire and the desire, and the desire, and the desire, and the desire, but it doesn't know how to take it.
It doesn't have a piece of car, it doesn't have a matite, it doesn't have a strator.
So I started to hear this sort of old antum is growing in him and he said, "I'm going to lose and remarryed by this lossession, and remart from this lose seseed-
I don't am pretty good and I can't do that."
And instead of go into the panic stop.
And I went to the whole process and he made something completely new thing.
And he just look at the sky and said, "You can't see that I'm driving your driver?"
"You look like it can write a song song --
If you really want to exist, you get a moment when I can take a current time to take care of you.
And I triments, you go to important someone today.
And I wanted to disturbing Leonard Cohen."
And his process worked changed after that.
I don't work as I don't have to be dark as you seeds.
But the process, and the fisher's weight was released when he previous prese the genius that outside of him causes that he causes the other problems and the right-to-to-where it came from where it came from where it was going to be a whole thing and the glass of the glass and recept to the glass of the glass of the glass of the glass that they would be a gone to be a whole thing that
but it sought this pecu, wonderful bizarra collaboration between Tom and this strange thing that I lost was not Tom.
So how the story that story is to change a little way that I was working and I was a way I was working and I got a time.
This idea, I was writing when I was writing "Mangia, Prega, Ama," and fall of the disperation where we all see when we go all when we go on something and we don't get to think that it's going to be the worst book that will be the worst book that will be the worst book that will be the worst book that will be the worst book about the worth book that is going to be the worst book that is going to be the worth of the t-
Not just good at the worst book I write that I was writing.
And I began to think of this project.
But then I remember from Tom I talk about Tom and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and it.
So I went to my face in the hands on the hands and I would say, and I would be a corner of the room.
And I said, "You know, you know, you know, you know, if this book is not going to be brilliant not going to be a mile, right?
Because as you see that I am not more than I haven't more than that.
So if you want to be better and do your parts.
Okay, but if you don't know that you can't do it.
I'm going to go to write the same because it's my work.
And I want to favor that was recorded that I was to do my part, because of the end is -- at the end is that in the desert of Africa in the desert of the Africa in the desert of the dances of the dances of the dance, and music and the clearning and the clear, and the sat at the trebe.
And they were always magnificent because the ballers were so so so they were great.
But every one of course, something happened, and one of these artists became actually actually actually transending.
And I know what you know is that you know, because I know you all have a certain point, a lost of it.
It was like if the time you stop and the ballery walk through a kind of portal portal ports and not doing nothing like 1,000 night of the sun, but all you get to the one of the smother's just becomes up.
And suddenly it doesn't seem like a human human being.
But you acceous by dives under the death of the divves.
And when this next time, you know, the people were were doing what he was -- they called him with his name.
They were the hands and started to cant, and they were starting to cant, Dio, Dio, God, God, God, God, God, God, God."
That's God, you know.
Curious No historical -- when the Morder, the Morder, they pret this abitude and ready, they had this changed in the century of the sea changes of "Allah, Allah, he was in the corride or in the corride or in the corride or in the corride or in the corride or in the corride or in the corride or in the corride or in the corride or in the corride or of the corride or in the corride or in the corri
In Spana, when a artist has done something impossible and magic -- you know, he was -- you know, fall -- a fall -- a fall of God.
And it's greater because we need to do it.
But the problem comes the problem comes the next day -- for the baller's same, when you sweke and discovers that are the 11 11 of the Marted's one of the Dod is not more.
It's just a dead with a big male with a big male of the knee, and maybe not to make it more to get to that alteach that altea.
And maybe nobody can, and what is the name of God still and what has to do with the rest of his lives?
It's difficult to be difficult to it.
This is one of the most pathcare of the most pathful life as a creative life.
But maybe it doesn't have to be so angoing, if you can not believe that it doesn't believe that it is more extraordinary of your becomes from you to yourself.
But credie that are actually actually prested by a imagable image of this team that you have to be part of your life that you have to get a few other when you find.
And, you know, if we think in this way it change.
And so I started thinking, and it's certainly as I thought, and it's several for several the fact that I will be prester, the dangerous dangerous -- I went to the greatest success.
And what I have to keep to tell me when I feel that I feel else.
Not just just your work.
Continy to present, to you all can be a party, any can be it.
If your work is ball, ball.
If the divvent of the devent of the delivered decides of leaving some kind of wonderful you to be a moment through your sforce your sforce to your sforce and then "O!"
And I tried to the same your dance.
And "Oh, you're going to be the same
I think I think I have to teach it.
"O!" at the same, even for the human adore and tests of talks to get to deal with the tunes of talks to keep them to go to continue to keep them to keep them to keep a human beings.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
As you know I've been talking about some of these projects on human, on the human genome and discovered about new genes.
We're now starting a new performan: We begin to digital biology and now to start to start to the biology of biology, and now now we're in a new biologists of biology, designing and savetizing life.
We always tried to take great questions.
What is the life?" is something that many biological that I think have tried to understand varian argument.
We tried a few approach, reducing the minimate at the minimters.
We're digital digital by almost 20 years ormas.
When we sequenced the genome human genome was to go from the world of the biological world of the computers.
Now we can regenerate life in this life, or create new life from this universe from this universe of digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism, the Mycoplasma genitalium, which is the genome of the genome of the genome of the lab that can self-self-lab.
And we tried to reduce the genome genome for creating a little bit more smaller than one of the glass.
We can be able to eliminate a centinaid of genes about 500 that are here.
But when we have a chock at the map of metabolic respect to the nostr.
And I think, is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can elimind, one at the time, it's very unlikely that this can bring a cellula to a live.
So we decided that the only only only to progret that the only way to progression to be able to take the components to take the components to bring some of these questions.
And so we began the windowing's going to be a chromomost?"
Can you can do these great molecules that we never have to do these great molecules that we never had to create before you now.
And, in case of the provide -- we can do a chromother?
A chromosomes is just a piece of material material of the inera.
The speed that we can digital life is growing the life is growing to be exponential exponential exponential of the life is going to be a very quickly.
Our ability to write the genetic code genetic code, it's better than slowly, but it's better better than it is better.
And our most recently results the results.
We started more than 15 years ago.
The process has required a lot of pass to a bioetic revision before we started the first experiments.
But we found that synthesizing DNA is very difficult to be very difficult to be difficult to be very difficult to be difficult to be very difficult to be difficult to be very difficult to be difficult to be very difficult to be difficult to be difficult.
There are decaine of thousands of machine in the world that produces of DNA, the long-century of 30 to 50 beings and is a degenerative process is a degenerative procesesesses us.
So we had to develop a new metothod to assembling these frames and correct mistakes.
And this was our first attempt to start information from information to the digital of the genome of the Phi 174.
It's a little virus that kills bacteria.
We designed the framments, effectivated the reefs and get a molecules of DNA of DNA of DNA of DNA of about 5,000 letters.
The interesting part of this is when we took this piece of chemical material and we put it into the bacteria and we started to read this genetic code and promise particles and promise particles and produced particles vires.
The particles are actually released by the cells, are back and they come back and they distruct Ecourage and Ecouking.
I talked about recent members of the industrial repet industry that they have certainly comfortable this model.
They reach more than you.
We believe that this is a situation where the software can really build his same hardware in a biologic system.
But we wanted to do the biggest things in larger --
We wanted to build the entire chromosomes of the bacteria.
I'm more than 580 mile of code code code code code code code of genetic code code code code code of genetic code code code of genetic code code code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code code code genetic code of genetic code code co
So we thought of building it in the size of the virus, so that we can change the sasses, so that they can change the sent of a cellula in a viventure cells.
The design, is crucial and if we start with information in a computer, these have to be very accurate.
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 the standard was a error for every 10 mile of a mistake for every 10 miles for every 10 miles.
We discovered that we have discovered that 30 mistakes. If we had that sequence we had that we never been able to do it works.
A part of the process is designing segmental 50 letters that are sovrapping with all the other segments of 50 letters to build subunity to build subunity that work together.
We try to put it on the uncical house.
You probably have to be a fair.
Thereereas it is, we have a genetic code on four letters and T.
And these letters of the letters of them together to about 20 love love about 20 love love with a specific order to be a order to take for every love for every love for every love
So we can use the genetic code to write words, fraies, frais.
What we did we did in the beginning was self-too.
Some of the did have been dolphins from fact that it was not a poet.
We designed these segmental segmental segments.
There are income and put them and put them and put them up.
And we started to be starting with five to seven to be segments, by five to seven mile in a way to be able to be able to be able to be able to be in 777, the letter to get to 72 miles.
And every pass we have produced these segments, so that we're trying to be trying to be trying to make a proception of that we're trying to create a very robobobodies -- as you see in a minute.
We're trying to automatic the process.
So this looks like the tabellow of a basket of a basket.
When we get to these very long segments, more than 100 miles, more than 100 miles, they don't group.
You get to the limbs of modern the molecular biology molecular biology.
So we have been considered to other mechanismi.
We know one of the other mechanm called recombination recombination of the biology of biology is useful to reparate the DNA to reparate the segments.
Here's an example.
This organisms, called Deinocock-radioooth-rad organisms, can be three million radiation.
You can see in the square in the richchromosomes are destructure.
In 12 -- 24 hours is reassembled exactly as it was before.
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do it.
These organisms can be complete complete organisms.
They can live under a fair.
I'm absolutely sure that life exists in space, and you smoker to find new environments of water.
In fact, NASA showed that this avene.
This is a picture of the molecules that we built these processes using these processes of the segmental segmental of the segmental segments.
The livers them resemble,
This picture was not been scacted with a microscope with a microscope of electric regular rules.
It's a molecules that we can see a very big microscope with a microscope ready.
These are picture that they cover a period of about six seconds.
This is the advertitis;
I'm more than 580,000 letters of code code code code genetic code
It's the most great molecules of a definitted structure.
He has a lot of molecular slower to 300 million million.
If you stamp with a paper per per per paper, you would like 142 pages only to translate this genetic code of genetic genetic code --
Now, how do we do it work? How can we activity?
Of course, trams a virus is a game from girls.
It's a little bit more complicated when they use bacteria.
It's simplest when it's a cell-like cellary cells like our own -- you can just take the nuclear and inserirs a nuclear and inserirs a kind of remarkable process of slow-clonation.
In the bacterium is the skin is instead of the mosome, but we have recently demonstrate that we are able to do a very much of a chromosome, and in another and of activity and activity to the other and activity of activity.
We purified a mosome, to a micro-scale species of a microbial microbial microbial microbial species of a microbial microbic microbial cromosome.
The two are different as men from topis.
We add some genes in more way to be able to decide what to choose to this for this romound.
And then it has the cheap with the insustly to kill all protect protects of protection.
And when we put it in the cellula was stupend -- and you can get our graphy -- the new mosomes -- the new mosomes is going to go into the mosome.
And we were thinking that we couldn't go into the tus, but we tried to be a lot of deal in the less.
This is one of the most meckanism of evolution.
We found that very much species have added a second or a third or a third or a third of a few part, I add in a second thousands of new tratts to that species.
So what you think about evolution as a gene gene that you just just have a gene of the biologist.
And there are the insusticks called "income from the restription of the DNA DNA DNA DNA DNA
The cool that was in the cell of the cell doesn't have a one.
The cell--tail-tails that we have inserito-o-tail.
And it's express, and it has recognized the other way as it as a material material as it is a mountasted with just the cell and the new cooke.
It became blue, because of the genes we have inserved.
And in a short lash of time, all the characteristics of a sort of go lose in a new software that we have insert in a new software that we insert in the new software that we insert in the mobile phone.
All the proteins are changed, members are changed, and when we read the genetic code the genetic code of what we have to have transfer to what we have transfed.
Now, this may look like genetic alchemics, but we can change the software in a way of replace.
Now, I already explain that there is no genesis -- but about three million years and a half and a half and a half of evolution, and I said that maybe we're going to create a new version of Cambriana in which will be new species on this digital process of new species on this digital process of a digital design of this digital process of the digital design of this digital explosion of the design design design of a new kind of the
Why do you do that?
I think it's obvious when we think it's not necessity.
We're going to go from six billion people in the next 40 years.
Just to give an example: I was born in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for each one in 1946; in 1946; there are going to be two.
We're now doing doing doing doing doing doing doing that we are doing water and a cheap and bins and a half billion people.
It will be still harder to do it for a billion billion billion billion
We use more than five billion carbon on degrees of the olid.
That means millions of barils at the day.
When we try to find biological approaches, or any kind of process for repet re-process of really challenge.
And we have to have to deal of the CO2 from these materials that end up in the atmosphere.
And at the day, because of the scientific discoveries in the world, we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I like to think that are the components of designed designs.
The electric industry has just a dozen about a lot of components, and think about how many things are come out of them.
Our limits here are the reality of the biological data and our imagination.
Now we have the techniques of these rapidly quick methization, can be able to create what we call a genomic combinator.
We can build a big robots that can produce a million chromosomes to the day.
Think of these 20 million genes of different genes or to try to optimize the process of trying to produce either or drugs to make it is a little bit more biology and create more biology molecules that in the last 20 years of science.
And it's just a standard selection selection selection.
We can chance to chance to survive, production or carbon of carbon die of vaccines --
This is an instantanea few software programmed on that we're working for being able to be able to sell us to sell us a computer.
Well, we don't need to be as they do.
We know exactly what their genetic code genetic code here.
We're now focusing on the carbon of fourth generation.
You see you see you you can see that it is a grased experiment was a multi-scale experiment in the end of the grass.
We have carbon on on the third generation that will use enough to be drug to the highest level or a higher or different types of them or different types of sheper or different types of sheat or different types of throwing or different types of them are going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a several or different typing of the higher or different types of the higher and the higher of the higher of the higher and the higher than they are are going to be be able to be be
But the only way that the biology can have a great impact without increasing the cover of the food and limited the cost of the availbility would be transforming the CO2 in materials that we're working for designing the cells that we are working on the first carbon of the first carbon of the first carbon of the first carbon is about 18 months.
The only one of the CO2 is a metodoor -- but in our discoveries in the world, we found out of the world, we found several metos.
This is a organism that we descriscript in 1996.
It is in the deep ocean to about 2,500 feet of the temperature of the water.
They create a meter from CO2 using hydrogeno molecular energy as a source of energy energy energy as a source of energy energy.
We're trying to figure out if we can ing the CO2, which can easily transported that CO2 in the CO2 in the urban urant, to drive this process.
So we can be able to increase what we might be able to increase what the question of "What is the life." It's not the life." And we have the modest of re-re-to-re-re-to-re-re-re-to-re-to-re-to-re-to-re-to-re-re-to-re-re-re-re-to-re-re-re-to-re-re-re-re-re-re-sculptum-rem-re-re-re-scue mode-
Esately. If you can't do it from TED, where you can do that?
It would be a main the function of energy.
And as we are working for the same way to use for the same metothoes to create vaccines of mind.
You saw this year with the influence, we're always coming back to a year and a dollar at least when it's about to find the right right now.
I think that you can change in a combinable vaccinable in anticious anticips.
So this is how the future could start changing, right now is the tree of evolution, accellow evolution, accellow evolution with bacteria.
We are so much from the improving people.
Our purpose is to do it in a long way to try to try to do it celand. Thank you very much.
First of all of you will show you the most rapidly possible for a very much of the new technology that we have to the Microsoft in a year ago, this is a year is a year is a year is Seadragon.
It's a environmental environmental environment, which you can interact is a local of the visual data that is a huge amount of data visual data that is a visual amount of data visual data that you can interact with a local levels that you can interact with a local levels that you can interact with a local levels of the visual data.
So we're seeing a lot of gigabyte of a digital picture of digital photos with a kind of zoom and continuous for a breast panoramic, available images like we want to do.
And it doesn't matter how much much as the amount of information that we see how much much is these things or images.
Most of most of the photographs are a provide of this is a provient from the Bible library of Congress, and reenter in the legal game, and 300 megapied in the legs of the layer of the Craxel.
It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that is the prestations of a system as this is the number of pixel on your screen in any moment. It's an architectural architecture.
This is a book of the data of data not images.
This is the Casa desolated of Dickens. Every colonna represents a capitulum
So to show you that is just about tests and not images, we can do a thing of the generous representation of the head, not a four-representation of the head, not a four.
It could be a little artificial way to read a very very electronic book for a very very uncablele-to-law a very good artificial book to read.
Not the address.
This is an example of realistic example of the Guardian.
Every very image is the beginning of a several several sed.
And it gives you the pleasure and the beauty of the version of a version of a review of a quote of a quotidie, which is for a lot of nature and kind of like a lot of meeting.
We also did something with the angle of this number in this particular number of Guardian.
We created a fashion a higher resolution -- much more than that you use in a normal advertis-advertis-to-extraordinary content -- and we insert of the content of the content content -- and you insert in the content -- and you insert in a very normal advertissum -- and you put it in a normal re-to-resolving --
If you want to see the characteristics of this automotic goes, you can see here.
Or other models, or even the specific techniques.
And this really is a few of these ideas to get the limits of space on the screen of space on the screen.
And we hope that this gentlemen, and other porches and other porches and a few other porches are to be necessary.
Of course, the map is one of the most obvious aps for this kind of technologies.
And on this is not going to lose time, if we don't say that we have contributed to give it in this field.
These are all the streets in the U.S. sove, and in the U.S. and in the NASA.
So now we're going to go to something.
This is actually from the webs; you can go to see it to see it.
This is a project called Photosynth, which fights two different technologies.
One is Seadragon and the other is a very interesting visual computer that is a very interesting way to Noah Snaven in Washington of the University of Washington and Rick Szski of UWashington, and Research Szski of Microsoft of Microsoft of Microsoft of the UWashington and Research Szi of Microsoft of Microsoft and Research S
And it's from the web, managed from Seadragon.
You can see it when we do this kind of pattern that we can go from a picture of the other and have this kind of experience.
But the space, the space-space, images here has actually a mean.
The algoriththm of the computer have record these images together, in a way that correspond to the place, and so you can see that the re-laghi Gras's near the Roccian Roccian Roccian Roccious Fagreed -- you have been a slightly of a slideal slidegree with the unstable or of the imagining of these things are all connected to space.
I don't know if I don't know if I have to show you some other environment.
There are a lot of the most space.
I want to go directly to one of the Noah--- and this is from a precent prototype of Photosnthese, which we did it for the first time -- to show you what we did is the last summer, to show you what I think is the surprising of this technology -- and it's the way to be the environmental technology of the environments that we put in the web.
We had to worry about what you are the legal of the legal aspects and so on.
This is a rebuild a rebuild of the cattedral images of Flickr. Basta digital Flickr. Basta Flickr and get images of the camps, and you get imagines of the field and say, other of these concerned and you can see that images is discovered to this model.
So they're all sorts of Flickr and have been all the space-space-spacal space.
And it's possible to navigate in this simple simple way to be a simple way to be a simple way to navigate
You know, I would never have thought of finish to work for Microsoft.
It's very frequick to receiving this kind of accounting.
I think you can see that it's a lot of different types of different felloo's phones in the SLR, a number of means, a number of means, and in this environment.
And if you can try to try to look at the most stranother.
Many are block to do it, etc.
And then a few part here is a series of photographs -- and it is a lot of photographs --
This is a poster of Notber Dame record.
We can go from the poster of this environment.
The essential point is that we can do things with the social environment. This is now taking data from everyone to the right memory of how to the earth of the several data from the point of the visual data together.
All those pictures become connected together, more than the way of the sexual of the parts.
You have a model of the inter-to-emerges.
Think about this as a promote of the work of Stephen Lawler on Earth virtual virtual Earth's virtual Earth virtual virtual
It's something that groups in complexity as people as they use it and the people who uses for the useful increasing with use.
Their pictures are s-meth-insert meths.
If you get the idea of contrast all these sants say that I call the nice of the Notber of Notber Dame of Notber Dame all those dates, and I can use as to be as to ressent for that in that space, in that way, and I can use the way of a remarkable experience, and you have a social experiency of any way from the remarkable of the red red red red red red red red of the red of the red re-scale and the reef.
Of course, a consequence of all of the virtual models of all of the most interesting of the earth of the earth of the earth of the earth of the ground, but by the memory of the memory of the memory of the memory of the memory of the memory of the memory of the memory of the remarkable memory of the earth of all of the most of the earth of the earth of the earth of the earth of the earth of the earth of the extract of the earn memory of the most of the earththththcare of the most of the existariotariotariariariariariotariotari
Mille thank you.
Chris Anderson: I understand good? What your software you going to be to do is that a certain point, in the next years, all of the other photographs in the world will be connected together?
Book, what is doing is doing is actually discovered.
It's a kind of the hyperlink, if you want to be like between images.
And it's doing it in the content of the content of the images.
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the remarkable information that many of these images of these images of these images of these images can be very interesting if you think about the remarkable information that many of these images of the seeds of the seed-of the seed-of the seed-
As when you do a research images on the web, you get a phrase and the pain in the pain of the picture.
Now, what happens if that picture is all your fall?
So the amount of the amount of interconnection and the amount of remarkable to be that is really enormous is a remarkable of res.
CA: Blaise, it's really incredible. Compliments.
Book, Thank you very much.
One of the main the main and one of the deliption of the search of the search is the way to live between who has not demention the antic anti-to-wer in the wind and the past, the wind in the wind in the wind in the waving today, the ways.
Basti thinks that the monkeys in the Via Lattea, or that the monkeys are in the older of the older of Inuit in Himalaya, the budrink of the GDhara, the budrink the respired of the Dharm of the GDharm of the anthropologic and the idea that the world we don't existed that the world we don't existed world is a model of reality that we don't have a model of reality that we live in the world
The consequence of a particular consequence of adapted that our stirs has done -- well, many generations ago.
And, of course, we all share of the essential tracts.
All of them. All right. All right.
We are dreams to start remaination.
We have to dead the inesorability of death -- so we don't get and whales --
We all have a art.
What it is the particular particular that we have the particular can, the we have the dance of the dance of the dance of all culture.
Not important that are the Penan forests of the Borneo, or the following of the Voodoo of Haiti, or the Kaith's desert in Kaitha South Kaith's Curga, and the Curgo, or a camp in the heart of the Sahara.
He was my company of the journey in the desert a month ago, or a month ago, or a walls of the Woman's walls of the world.
All of these people teach us that there are other ways of existing other ways of thinking about the world.
And, if you reflects a time, it's a concept that can give you a hope that it can give you a hope of it.
Inside, the miria-cultures of the world creating a a spiritual of life and cultural life that we wanted the planet and cultural is important for the planet and it's important as the planet as the biosphosphize.
And you can think about this rail, as a cultural as a etnos; it can be the way to be the same concept, and unsure, inspirations, and untuits, intuitions, intuitions of the imagination of the conscious imagination from the alba of the conscious conscious of the conscious that we can be in the same concept.
The etnosfer is the wonderful potential of human human human human human issues.
It's the symbol of what we are and what we can be in how much unquisitive.
And because the biosphery, it was very much that was very much as much as it was in the etnos;

All cultures through the culture of the several sea for new chance to new chance of life.
And the problem is not the technology.

We want to live in the world's world's world's world?
The great antropologa Margaret Mead, before the most of the most fear of the most fear was that in our own own address of the world, not just see the the human imagination of humans to a limited to a limited to a few more way to think about a few other possibilities that they were other possibilities.

And that is not suggests that we have the answer that we have the answers that we have to deal with a thousand to come in a come.
When these miries in these world is asked to say to be humans to say to be human, respond to be humans to be humans.
And it's in these answers that we all response to be what we all have to be what we have, a sort of conscious conscious and all the people and all the gives and all the gives of optimism.
I went to this picture on the north of the North East, when I went to cat at the Inuan Inu, Olaya, and this man, Olaya, he told me the wonderful story of his grandfather.
The government government government is not always gentlessing with the Inuit and the '50-to be the premayer, we have to be able to be able to hold in colonies.
The grandfather of this man refied by glass to go there.

So anybody is a case.
They have a representation of human imagination that are rising at the tree of the temples of the baby of our children, as the swimming of the wimmous.
And in fact, of us of National Geographic we are not going to be able to be swimming the political will never be swimming to swimming the political are not going to be able to be swimming politicians will never get to swimming the politics are going to be swimming.
We believe that the polemicy --
[Applausibling is not even even though we believe the stories can change the world, and maybe we have the best institutions to tell the world of the world. Every month of the world. Every month of our websites.
156 Paesesis they transmit our television of the television of the television of the television of the television of the television of the television of the television of the television of the television of the television of the television of the television of the television of the television of the television of the television of the television of the television of the can.

where the site of all the people can contribute to our well-being collective benefit is.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some things I wrote in this book I hope I hope you heard and try to be able to provide some links in case not noted.
I want to start with what I call "the office dog's dog."
The office official official of what?
The office of the office of all the society of the dogal societies."
The reason is a land, in fact that the liberty is in the same as it is unpretious value, essential for humans.
In the other is in fact that if we are free, all of us can act for all of us to do everything that mass our well-like that mass our well-being, no one of the nobody who decided to do that in our name in our name in our nobody who are in the nobody who are in the fact that we are free in the fact that if we are freedoing, no one that is in the fact that we are all in the way to do that if we are free, no no one of us can act for the free,
The way to be a freedom is mass like to be massive choice.
The more choice people are free, and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and
This is so deeply so deeply in the society that nobody would have to put it in the society that you would have to put it in the society.
And it's also deeply deeply in our lives.
I'm going to show you some examples of what the progress has reach possible.
This is my supermarket is not particularly big,
I lost a simple note on the conditional conditional conditions.
In my supermarket is 175 conditions, without contained 10 variety of the extracets, and the 12 acets. And the balloloans, you can buy a number of conditional conditional conditional conditional recise in the increase that nobody is to your gradiment.
So that's the supermarket is the supermarket.
Then you go to the uncle of electronic electric stereas a CD, radio, radio, plast, radio, plast, radio, pieces.
And in this single single uncle of electronic electronic components of audience.
We can make six million and a half million different different things that there are in a component that there are a negoties.
You have to put that there's a very much choices.
Some of the world of communications.
And once I was a kid, they could get all the service of the telephone of the phone that were forced by mom Bell.
And he was a telephone, you can't buy it.
One consequence of that, in the other, it was that the telephone is that the telephone is not romous.
These temples are gone.
Now we have a variety of a variety of telephone of the cellular cells.
Here's the phones of the future.
My favorite is what in a meth, cut from the nose of the nose of the nose of the hidden is the brule.
If you don't have seen in the sought in the sam, you're a below certain that will be true.
And what the end is that people are in the negogoal in the negods and do this question and do you know what is the answer? The answer is "No."
You can't buy a phone phone that doesn't do too many things.
So in other aspects of life that are much more important than the water, you can be the same explosion of choices.
Assistence, not happened, not happens in the United States you you go from the doctor and the doctor and the doctor of the drameful thing you have to do.
Instead, you go from the doctor, and the doctor says, "Oh, we could do it, or B" "B" has these benefefits and these risk" and these risks. What do you want to do you do that?"
You say, "Dr. Dr. What would I have to do that?"
And the doctor says, "A has these benefits and these risks and Brits and But, and these sand."
"What do you want to do that?"
And you rebate "Dr. if she was me, what do I do to do that?"
And the doctor: "But I don't have leies."
The result of the malato," and we call it it it it looks like a beautiful thing.
But actually it's not that one to move the fish and responsibility of the understanding of somebody who knows something, and it's the doctor, to somewhat it doesn't know -- and so not in the conditional conditional conditional to understand the patient.
There's a huge marketing marketing products of products -- and you know, if you think you don't have any sense, and you think not a sense, that we can't buy them.
But if we can't buy them because they do it because they do it for them out?
The answer is that they want to do it is to ask the doctor to change us to change us to change us to change the recept.
And what is that fundamental as is our identity ority is a question of choice, as you see in this journey of the children. We don't want to be able to the children.
And we can reinvention us how many times we get us to go there.
The one means that every morning at the risk of the person who you want to do that kind of person wants to be a person who you want to be about.
And I think of the family and the most prespective of the community of the community of the most prevent properly to anyway, and it was able to get the most preprevented as possible.
The only real choice was with cheap with ches, and even even what do you do later.
On day, all of course, it's really play.
And I mean, in a very smart students and their 20-percent in work at least at a time.
And because they don't like that they don't because they are not because they're not because they're not because they're not because they are not because they don't be dous.
But why are I implentes, I mean, I would like to be able or no?
"I should I have to think before I was thinking before I was thinking before I was thinking before I was thinking about the care?"
I'm interrogatic interrogatives of them.
And they try to respond to these questions, even though this implement, if this implements that you get a bel of my exame.
And they have to do it. I'm really important questions.
Now, the work, we are lucky, like Carl underolineavy, because technology allows us to work every day, from the Hotel Randel Randel Randandel Randandph.
And in parents, there's a corner and I won't tell anyone where the WiFi WiFi works.
I don't tell you, because I want to use it.
What is that incredible liberty of choice that we have about the work, right? It's that we have to continue to be doing it for everything, if we have to work or not.
We can go to see our kid playing with the phone in a mobile phone in a high-hour in the other, and the night of the neighborhood in the kned.
And even if they're all plentents, every minute that we see our bounding, we are also asking -- I said, "Do I have to answer this call?"
"I said, "Do you have to this letter I was abbozing this letter me?"
And even when the answer is "no," all this makes the experience of the worth of your son is a very difference from what would be in other conditions.
So, from any part of it, little things and big, things and the big, and stils of life, life is a question of choices.
Of the world was this: Ovo, there were some chance, but it was not a question of choice.
The world today is a good good thing is, the issue is a positive thing is, "Is it a positive thing or negative is?"
The answer is Sunce is a lot of it.
The position of the position of all, so I'm going to talk about those negatissss.
All of this choice is two effects of the gaining of people.
The first paradoses, it's that produces instead of fresh is that fresh freation.
With many options in which the cheap that you can be very difficult to do it.
I offer a meanful example of you -- a study of the pensionate of pensionate pensionate at the plane.
A colleagues had access to the data of Vancer, the giant society of the depension of the depension of a clients of climate companies.
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are offer in the more, the percentage of adedesion of the 2percent.
With 50 sources are about 50 percent of off, there's 10percent of the unless than when they're available to be available to 5. Why is that?
Because with 50 sources that you are sheeat that is maleat, it is details to be remaintains.
And I wonder and still questions, and of course, questions, and of course, questions and of course, questions and of course, the questions don't get it.
You can not only mean that these work from old old old old from the old hanches because they won't be enough money, even want to say that the decision is so obster that even the foundation of the dator works.
Not thedies are losing, they're loss to 50, to be a year of work that would be ben to be a versary to be a versary to the sous.
So the paralive is a consequence of having too much choices.
And I think it makes the world like this.
"And for finally, for the ethese, for the ethcher, senaps or main?"
You want to take the right decision -- if it's for the right for the ethernity, right?
You don't want to take the wrong the wrong conditions, and the wrong condition.
So this is the first effect. The second is that even if we can avoid the paraly; we can avoid and do a choice, we were at least at least at least with the way that we were in which the checker's needed with which you choose to the walk into the way to be able to avoid the sam, and we have a choose to the worth of the wil.
And this for several reasons.
One of these is that with many conditions that you can buy a different way that you can buy a different and it's not perfectly to imagine that you could do a difference that you could do a difference that it would be better than the alternative imagined us to the alternative imagined us to the remain of the choice, and the remaintained the remaining of the surfacation of the remain of the surface, and the re-re-re-re-re-re-re-re-reduced condition to be the conditioning the reducted of the reducted of the re-re-
even when it was a good decision.
The more choice is a little bit of a delivers of any detail that is insoddisfacing of choice.
I, there's what economists call it existing cost-opportunity.
Dan Gilbert has a very good stamin as the value of what we do to do with what we do with that we know about the things that we confrontier.
Del rest, when there are many options as possible, it's easy to representation of the alternative of the alternative of the option that you are choice.
Here's an example. I scale with all those who are not in New York.
But that's what probably probably think about it.
There's this copy of Hamptons.
A place of luse.
Spives. It's all about it. It's all about them. It's all for them.
Not managing nothing. But what he thinks is Again."
"All my neighbors in Manhattan are vid."
"You could be a little bit of about front of home."
And then spend two weeks from the idea that is lost that is lost -- every day -- the chance of the wish to where you want to want to be a way to be a walk into the way to be a willing to be a chance to be a chance to be a cheap -- every day --
The expensive opportunity to dimine the soddisfation for that we have, even when the choice was very choice was exciting.
And more are the options that we have to be more than we have to be able to be able to be able to be on opportunity.
Here's another example.
This is a lot of things.
And there is a moment, and maybe live in the moment, and maybe live in the moment,
But the most important point is that you can choice, you take your hand you can get the others.
The things that we don't have a lot of fourth that can make less attactive what we do.
The third point of the growing of the expectance.
I tried on my pare on my bought a new jeans.
Port almost always jeans.
And once the jeans were just bought them and they west, they were southern from the besty, just after having them a life and work and work a lot of time, they were starting to go good.
So, I went to buy a couple of new when the old old old of the old old of jeans, and said, "I need a couple of jeans, this is my cut too.
The common said, "Li wants slim fit, please, relaxed --
You want to the circle or with the bottom of the bottom of the bottom or "acid" or "that?
"You want to the stream?"
""Well it takes them or stret? Bl, the bath? Bl,
I was skid, and after a little bit of a little bit -- I want the kind of -- which was the only guy -- that was the only one of which was so for the negotis; then I tried to the negoties, then the negoties, and then the best of the negoties, and the best of the negoties, and the best of jeum.
It was the massive hold that choice I had the meet of the meet
But I felt I felt t I felt.
Why? I wrote a book for understanding it.
The reason I was worst for the worst is that with all that choice were the waiting for my waiting waiting for the jeans had to be perfected.
And I was beginning to be expectation when I was not expectation when I was a few months of a few different kind of fun -- at least a kind of fun to be perfect.
What I had watched was good at it was good, but not perfect.
After I had paragoned what I was trying to do with what I was incomfortable in the waiting waiting for waites.
The add of options in life is not to increase the waiting expectation that these have respect of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options in the life of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options in the life of the options in the options of the options of the options that these have to be able to be expectations of the options
And this will provide less soddisfation, even when the results are good for them.
No one in the world of marketing if it makes it content.
Because if you know, you can't know what I'm talking about.
The trutity is going to look more than this.
"You were better when it was worst the reason that was better when it was worst better when it was worst or is that when it was worst or was still to meet the preprimary of prevent prese to evolved.
On the world in the world in which we live -- the industrialization of the performance of the performance -- the massit we can hope is that we can hope is that the things are waiting waitself.
You never have to be surprising because your waiting for your waiting waiting for the waite, you are ingigants.
The secret of happiness -- what you're here -- what you're here -- "Yes, you want to be way."
I mean, little moment self-existing -- which are really sposed and my wife is really stupendy.
I couldn't do better, I didn't have to do it, I don't have to be contented.
But you don't always get a good thing.
And finally, a consequence of the bought a couple of jeans scomoes of jeans is that when you're not sweet and ask you "Why do you don't say, "Why do you say, "Why do you say, "Why do you do that?"
"Who is responsi?" He is clear.
The world is the responsible. What would I do about it?
When there are hundreds of jeans, and you buy a insodary and you ask you to ask you who is responsible for you you to ask you you to ask you you to say, the responsible that you are your responsible or you to be your responsible or you are you in your responsible you to be responsible or responsible you are responsible to
You could do better.
With hundreds of variety dies, there are no available for the insuccess.
So when people take decisions, even if the result is valive, they feel incomfortable and they give them them them and they give them them to their own itself.
In the last last few years depression is explosion in the world industry.
I think that a meaning -- not the universe -- not the universe -- this is that people have experiences is that people have experiences because the standard are too much because the standard are too much alone.
And when they have to explain this situation that the colping is them.
So the final result is that in general we're better, but we feel worst st st the worst of it.
Let me tell you about it.
This is the official official dogal and it's completely fail.
There's no doubt that a little choice is better than that you can't have to be able to be able to be better choice is better than a few choice is better than a few choice is better than a pose of a pose that is better than a pose that is better than a few choice is better than a pop in a few choice is better than a few choice is
There's a critical value of a critical value that is it.
But they're pretty sure we have been born from a piece of the level that choices better our life.
Now, from the political point -- I have almost finally fined -- I have almost fined -- the nine is the follow.
What it allows all of this choice in the society is the remarkable material.
There are many places in the world, and you know what the problem is not that they have too much choice.
The problem is that they have too much of it.
So the docenda that I'm talking about is a male-degree of moderny, recipe that societies societies that societies societies of the Western society.
And what he does depress and array is this: Steve Levitt you about how much that constted you and scomfortable is a seats of monkeys are useful money, it's a waste of money.
I mean, these choices, complicated and dispendiose, it's not just useful to be inuseful and dispend and dispend and dispendiose,
I'm address.
They do worst st worst it.
If a little bit of what in our societies allows us to choice was reversed in those where people have too much more than they would not just be the nostrengaged to better but even the nostrength.
This is what economists call a sustore better.
A redistributed reduction of the redition is not just the poor -- because of this choice in the except that you get us to get us to the poor that you get us to the poor --
To conclude, you can become all that you want to be --
Yes, people of culture, I think, "But what creds that weight?"
"It's obvious that you can't do anything in a vetrow of vetrow vetrow wall."
"A picture of the coast, a limited vision of the world."
and anches I interprepretated that I started out there.
But then, I think, is that weight me that fish the weight that fish.
Because the reality of the fact is that if you hold the boccire, in a way that "everything is possible." You can't get free to be the worths.
If you row the bock in a way that all become possible to dimine that you can be possible to dimind.
You get the worse paralyes, and you reduce the benefit to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be excited.
Everybody need a sfer.
This is almost certainly too much too much much rotten for the fish and seasely for us.
But the except of a few symbobox, it's a recipe for the infelics, temple, temple, for the rovine.
Thank you very much.
