The last year I showed these slide to show that the tears that the tears of artical artical hot for almost three million years has had the size of 48 percent has had four to have 40 percent of the 40 percent of the 40 percent of the United 40 percent.
But this is the falling gravity of the problem because it doesn't show the ice of ice because of the ice ice ice --
The artical climb is in a sense, the clean heart of the global climate system.
You expand it out, and you get right.
The next slide is going to be a fasty carlled on the last 25 years.
The gaus lost of the red board.
You see it as you see it expand the blue swoman down.
This is the ice in the winter winter of summer --
You can see that the glacior glacious glacious glacious or sket, is like the blood smoke.
In 25 years has passed from like this, I got to do that.
This is a problem because the interests interested in the lands of the art in the art ocean that there are huge amount of carbon that sheets that sheets are coming in meters -- they come from the microbies.
Remember to the totality of the atmospheric inquuggling, that four of global warming, that four pollution may not come back.
In some laka little deep deeply in Alaska ha's already basis from water.
The professored professored Katey Walter has made with a team has made a team was recated team at a team in the winter.
Video: Wow! At Gore: She is good. The question is if we are the question is if we are the well.
The reason is that this is that this termic swample is surrises the Greenland from the northermal Greenland from the northermal Greenland is that this is surrise surrises the Greenland is that this swample is that this swimmic.
This is a river.
The taken had never reached levels.
This is the Kangerlusaaq, in the south Greenland of the Greenland of the Greenland
If you want to know how the salalm of the gather's level, here is where the sea level of the garrafermal level.
These corrups are increasing rapidling.
On the other side of the planet: Antart, the biggest block of the planet.
The scientists have dichied the scientists have decrazy of the ice is in negative and that the Antarcticcrows on some of the islands on some islands on some islands.
And it's worth six feet of water in Greenlevel, like Greenland in Greenland in Greenlevel.
On Himalaya, the third block of ice block ice block of gather, who were a few years ago were ice in there.
The 40 percent of the world's population required half the potail from the shoot.
One is the source of the water is the source of water this city.
The doored is increased.
But when he diminishes, the same acks at the same potablind water.
In California in the Sierra Nevada is diminated by 40 percent of the four percent
The ride of the rips are in crisis.
The previsions, like you have read.
The growing security in the world leads to an incended,
The environmental disasters are increasing a rettless of the normal and without precedented precedented by the normal and without precedent.
Four times more number in the last 30 years of the last 30 years of the previous previous to previous about 75.
This is a unsustainable gain of unsustainable.
If you look at it in the hististorical context of it.
In the last five years we put 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the oceans every day.
Look at the oriental area of oriental Pacific Pacific and the west, and the west, and the western continent in the oceans.
The major of global warming, together with deforestation, together to the deforestation, which is the use of fuel.
The oil is a problem, and the carbon is even worse as a bad bad of the oil is even worse than the oil is even worse than the oil is even worse than the oil is even worse than the oil is even worse than the oil is even worse than the oil is even worse than it is even worse even worse --
The United States are one of the two countries with more emissions, together to China.
And it proposed to build a lot of other carbon disease.
But we're seeing to a change.
These are the annual projects in the last few years and some alternative proposites.
Everyway, there is a lot of politics in our country.
The carbon dibones and oil have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote the carbon carbon promote charcoal, which is a oxxymore.
The picture reminded me remind me me a --
Natmal Natma, in Tennessee, where I live, there was a loss of 3.8 billion ger chargers of carbon dioxipition.
Maybe you saw it on the news of the news.
This is the second biggest flow of dioxiety flower in America.
It happened around Natmakes Natal.
The natalizes of one carbon industries was this one.
Video: She would be a carbon is a type and happy --
It's abundant here in America, and it makes our economy.
Frosty the carbon is increasingly cleaner.
It's a good price, adorables and workers are kept the stick stick.
Al Gore: She here is a lot of the West Virginia.
The biggest society on mountains is Massey Coal. This is the administrator.
Video: Don Blland: I'm going to be clearly clearly -- Al Gore, Nancy Peloi, Harry Reid -- they don't know what they're talking about.
Al Gore: So the Alleance for the Clim of Clim has launched two nesses of the Clim has launched two campaigns.
This is one of it.
Video: Attor: At the COALery see the climate changes like a threat to our business.
So our priority is invest a great amount of money, in a public effort to make public and confuses the charcoal.
In fact, the carbon is not sport.
We think it's cleaned -- it also has a good fum.
So not preocupatents of climate change
Let me do that.
Video: Accorble-cleaned -- you have heard a lot of talking about a lot of it.
So let's take a game in a framework for the cleaning charcoals.
Straordinary cars are a little noise while, but this is the sound of the clean.
The consumption is between the main scaling causal warming, but the notice technology of carbon that you see it changes everything.
You look at a eye: this is the technology of carbon dioxide technology.
Al Gore: Finally, the positive alternative positive is connecting to the economic security.
Video: She is in America, is in the economy, the economy, the economy, security climatics.
The fabulous connects all the ones of the combustible, as the carbon dirty and the important.
Now, there's a new audge, a new audition for the cirn.
Repower America: 100th of cleaning diecital energy in 10 years.
They stay to put America on work, to make it safer than global warming.
Finally, a solution that is bastonishing our problems.
Repower America. Scopractice more.
Al Gore: This is the ultim.
Video: He's about re-re-energy energy in America.
One of the fastest ways to bring the dependence on the combustible combusts our planet.
I started with the future is here. I just goe, a new network, a new network.
She brought 2: Noves investment for places of well-retribits.
Christ: Lik: time to be realists.
Al Gore: A old African proverbbe, you get right now, you want to go to him.
If you want to go away away, you go away."
We have to go away, quickly.
Thank you very much.
The year at TED fect at TED fect on LHC.
And I promise to return to go back to how the machine.
So here I got it. And for those of the other time there didn't her, the LHC is the biggest scientific experiment -- 27 kilometers of circumsters of circumm.
Her compiece is to reach the conditions that were present less than a billion second from the beginning of the universe -- until 600 million times a second.
All of this is just environment.
This is the Gineva.
We photographs these Big Big Big Bang inside the reevators.
This is what I work. It's called ATLAS -- it's largely 44 feet and has a diameter of 22 feet --
This is a spectacular image of ATLAS in building so you can see the proportion of it.
The 10 seeptember of the last year we have access, the first time,
And this picture was taken by ATLAS.
It was because of immenses in the control.
It's a picture of the first particles of particles that had all the game of the LHC, and and it was done all the way around the LHC, and spread particles.
In other words, when we see that pictures the 10 of the 10 10 sects, we understand that the machine, which is a great liftop.
I don't know if it was to do it exult us more opposition, when somebody went on Google and saw that the page, he saw that the beginning was this.
That means we have an extremely cultural impact on the scientific impact.
About a week later, there was a problem with the car, had to these movies here -- these clips.
These files bring 13,000 feet when the machines works at the massive power.
Now, technicians between you look at files and say, "It's not true. I'm not true. I'm files too underly."
And they can do it because when they're very cold, they become the superconvictors.
So, at least 271 degree, to a inferior to the space of space, these movies can bring that corring.
In one of the most of the magnets in the LHC, there was a fabrication.
So the files were surrises that they resurrect up and 13,000 prints met a resistance of electrical resistance.
This was the result.
Now, this is even more impression, if you think that these magnets fish over 20 tons of 20 tons -- and that have been moved about 30 centimeters.
They are damage of about 50 magnets.
We had to take it up, what we have done to do it.
We have repristined and repristine repristine them and require it.
They're going back to their place up to their place underground.
I walked the end of the LHC is is going to be new integrated in the beautiful.
We accenenable it, and we expect data to get data or slue, and keep it and keep so our adventure to discover what the universe is the matts that are the universe.
Now, of course, in a way, these region the way these crashes the debate of science and engineering in frontiery. It's easy to confit to be conflict.
I think that the fact that it is so hard to go beyond the limits, I think is the value of things like LHC.
I'd like to conclude with the words of a Inglese, Humphrey Davy, what, I imagine, in defense of his pupll, his clear hpill, his clear Michael Faray, said, "No he's so dangerous for progress of the human mind as the science is definitive as the science that are definitive in nature, and that are not in nature -- and that are not in nature, and so that we don't know what."
Thank you.
I want to start asking you to rethink about it, as a children, you play with the morning.
And as you realize them and realized and they get them and move them and move it, and learn in fact, learning about the problems and hands and and handling relationships.
The space is deeply connected, the way we understand a lot of the world around us.
So, as inspired by inspired by using the usal usual objects, together to my consultent objects, together my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi, I started asking myself, I started asking mouse the mouse of the mouse as a policy that moves on a desktop, we can deal with an information with an information information with an entrameworks,
and we ensumption to our please?
The question was so interesting that we decided we decided we decided we decided to explore the answer, building Siftable.
In a few words, a Siftable computer is a very interactive computer --
In a few words, a Siftable computer is a very interactive computer --
You can move them with hand-a-hand and they can see it in their hands and have a screen and they have a wireless and they have a radio wireless.
But above all, I am physical objects, as the battons, you can just move it.
Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem of toolds to manipulal information.
And as they become more physics, and as they get more physics, and as they get more physics, and as they get more physics, and as we get more physics, and as we motion, we can explore new styyiles.
I'm going to start with some simple example.
This Siftable is configured to show video -- if you including it in a direction, the video will go back to the other side back.
These interactive riticals are aware of the others.
If you are in the what's interesting to what they are around it.
If they come circumstom, and they can get a little bit.
If they come circumstom, and they can get a little bit.
They also have their movement and inclination.
We realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was the power to use the data, for example "vers" -- a color as if it was a liquid.
In this case, we have three Siftable Siftable configurated as seckets and I can use them to do it to the colored colors in the mix of the color.
and I can use them to drop them in the midle in the central set.
If we true, we can put it a little bit of it up.
These are beautiful chance of learning, like the mathematics and games of logical and games of logical things that are very quickly, and see the resulted.
I'm going to --
This is a sequence of Fibonacus, I do with a program of equations.
Here we have a game game is half between Scarabeo and Boggle.
Oh, at every turn I got a letter to every turn home on every Siftable, Pratically, at every turn house on every Siftable, and you try to get words of words on a ditionary.
Then, after about 30 seconds remissing, and you have a new set of reading and new chance to try and new chance to try it.
Thank you.
Here is the children came to the Mid's Mid's Lab, I did it and I turned them and I turned a video.
They have a lot of them are please.
And one of the interesting things about this kind of application is that you don't have to give people a lot of educations.
You just have to say, "Componone," and they know exactly what to do.
Here is other people who try it.
This is our most youngest bete, there right there right there.
It actually wanted to be the biger them.
They just were the bricks, for him.
Now, this is a application of a interactive cardboard.
We wanted to build a tool appreciation of the Lui is Felix.
It can put new characters in the scene, skets in the scene, and it can be slighting.
It can put new characters in the scene, skets in the scene, and it can be slighting.
Well, it's doing the sun.
Video: The sunis sun.
David Merrill: He has taken a treat the scene in the scene in the scene in the scene.
Video: The aranancient treat.
Good goo!
So you get Siftable Siftable and put it together can interact the characters --
Video: Bau!
-- by inventing their story.
Video: Have it!
DM: It's a story with open-open-up, and it can decide him.
DM: It's a story with open-open-up, and it can decide him.
Video: Video: I live it.
DM: The last example I have time to show you is a toold, recently to shot and execkay and exective and execks and execk music.
it's a toold, realized recently recently to sample and execk and execk music.
The Siftable here are sleeping sound like the batteria.
Every one of these has four different variations, and you can choose what use.
You can put these sound sounds in a sequence to your experience to your feet to your please.
And it just making it just making a "sound sound and a "sequence."
These are the effects that you can control from living, like reverse and the filter.
The attacks to a particular sound and then including it to be in advanced it.
And then there are the general effects like time and volume, which is apply in the sequence.
Let's look at how it works.
DM: We're going to start put a base in two Sift," "sequence" -- we put the extend to be a serious, extending the sky; we put it into a serious.
Now I put a lower of the bottom.
Video: DM: Now on the fact --
Video: And I'm going to put the movie to the bacteria, so I can control the effect of living.
Video: I can faster the entire sequence the entire sequencing time from one or the other side of the side or on the other side of the side or on the side of the side of the entire sequence.
Video: And I'm going to add the movie to the lowest to the basic to give more expression.
Video: I can recombining the sequence of the volevidence "S."
I didn't have to plan before, but I can try and provising, making it a longer or more corty.
And now, finally, I can smoke the entire sequence inclining the entire sequencing the volumme."
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is building new interfaces that are all kinds of man-like machine our brain and more look like our brain and body.
And I have time to show you one of the outcommodities of this garms and also some possibilities that we try to bring out of the lab.
The concept I want to transmit you is coming this new generation of things that are coming in digital objects with digital media that will lead information in our world we want.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the hour of talking to all of you.
I'm a write write of it.
Scraving books is my professional is but it's more than that, of course --
It's also the love and the fashind of my life.
And I don't expect me that it can change
But I said that, something particular happened in my life and the career in my career, which he brought me to realibrating the whole realm with this work.
The particular thing is that I recently recently this book, this biography called "Mangia, Prega, Ama" -- whatever, in my previous -- for some reason for some reason that was a big sensational.
And the result is that everywhere is people are all the people who are me as if I convicted me as if I convicted me --
By -- convicty, convict!
They come from me and they all worried and they say, "Don't you afraid not be able to do this?
Don't stopping to continue to write all of life without being able to create a book that can be able to make somebody that can important,
that can be able to somebody who can me?"
It's reassure -- you know.
But it could go to the worse that I remember over 20 years ago, when I started to say people -- I was an adolescent -- I was an adolescent -- I wanted to be a write write to the write -- I wanted to be a write write -- I was a write of the most than 20 years ago, I began to say that I was a write write -- I was an adolescent to the people -- I was a writ
I met it against the same reaction of the fear.
And people said, "Don't be successful I can't have success?
Don't you fear the fear that the hollion reject you?
Don't afraid to do this mester all of life without that nothing is going to die on a heart of saving a sharp of shared skin with the mouth of suns to love care of falt?"
So you know, you know.
The wind answer -- the short answer to all these questions is, "S."
I fear of all those things.
I always had fear.
And I also have a lot of other things that people can't have to be there.
As a algae and other things --
But as I think about it is writing the one I thought and ask me is it the ultimously is why is?
Is it rational?
It's logical that anybody who needs to be scared by a job that you feel to do it.
But what is so particular in the imprecise creative impresely about mental healthy health half about the mental healthy not fannoy?
How do my father, for example, he was a chemical engineer and I don't remember one of her 40 years of activity where the asked if it was to engineer if he had to be engineer to be engineer engineer to be engineer with having capit?
It never was -- that block of the John, how do you know?
Don't work?
Enestly, the engineers as group not have certainly in the centuries, driven the reputation of being alcohyacks.
We have enough writers -- we have enough this reputation, and not just creative writers but creative all the reputation of all the reputation of being enormously instable.
And it doesn't look at the tristers of the disease of the magnific dies of magnific creative magnificent in the 2th century, and they are often and often for them.
And the ones who are not suicidata seems to be really disdded by their womens.
Norman Mailer, before I did, in the last interview said, "Ogns my book a little bit more than it was a little bit more about your life.
But we don't bat the time we have these things that because we have these things so we have these things so we somehow we have completely interior and accepted the notion that creativity and the suffering that art, and the art are going to get a woodse.
And the question I want to ask all of this is -- you know, I'm going to take this idea?
It goes you have this thing -- because it looks like it from a centimeter of me -- it doesn't have to do anything that supposed to do this supposition.
I think it's hodious.
And I think it's dangerous and I don't want to see it in the next century.
I think it's better to encourage our great minds creative lives.
And I know that in my case -- in my case -- in my case -- it would be dangerous to begin to that they had a bunch of the supposed I would have in my career.
which is a very young, you know, I'm pretty young, I have about 40 years.
I have about four work in me.
And it's very likely to be write that anything I would be writing from the world as the work that he came out of my last book.
I'll be skky, because we're all about the sket, it's probably probably the most greatest friendly success is to my shoulders.
Oh, Good down, that thought.
You know this is the kind of though I think that it leads a person begin to nine and I don't want to do it.
I would keep it to do this work, I love with this work,
So, the question become?
And so it seems me after a lot of reflections, which the way to work to keep is to create a psychological costruck struck structive psychological cool, OK?
I have to find a distance of security between me, I am I'm writing, and my natural reaction that I wrote pose that I wrote pose the reaction of the way I started looking through the time in how to do it began to look through the time when I started looking through the other societies to see if they could have the best ideas and healthy healthy more healthy ideas and healthy healthier and healthy healthy
how to help people creative people to help creative emotions.
And that research has brought me to the ancient Greea and the ancient Greeat.
Seguitems because it turns out to go back and then back.
In the ancient Grecia and the ancient -- people didn't think that creativity came from humans, OK?
And it was thought that creativity was this is a divine and that came up and selling a few surface, and unknown, for some distant surface, for distant distant distant and unknown.
The greglass called these divines of creativity of creativity "demoni."
Socrate, wonderful, believed that he was a demon a demon that elargiving wisdom.
The Romans were the same idea, but they were called the kind of spirit without the body a genius.
Which is great because the Romans didn't think that a genius was somebody particularly smart as a kind of smart.
They believed that a genius is this kind of diving entity that you believed in the walls of the study of an artist, a little bit like the Dobby, and that came out of the non-cost and modeling the around, and modeling the outcome.
Exional -- here is the distance of which I talk about -- that copsychological construction that you protect you from your work.
And everybody knew that was so that he worked, right?
So the anties were protected by certain things, like the too narcissm, right?
If your work was exceptional was that you can't get all the market, everybody knew that I had been helped by this encourage that I was helped by this incorpore.
If your work failure, it wasn't all copy, right?
They knew that was the top, you know, your genius to be a inable to be a inable inability.
And so people have conceived the creativity in Occident for a long time.
And then the Rinaascise came and all of changed and all of the big idea; we put the human being; we put the human beings and left space, and left space, and without and left space, and without and left space,
This was the principle of the rational humanmanital and people began to think that creativity came completely from the ispspring.
And for the first time in history, you began to referred this or art as a pretty much that a pretty person with genius.
And I have to tell you, I think it was a big error.
I think that allow somebody to believe that a simple person to believe that it is like a source, the beautiful and the smistakes, creatives and the surface, unknown, inknowledge or is a movie of a movie or is a movie of human being.
It's like to ask somebody to enjoy the sun.
Deform and the completely and creates all these ingestible ingestilization on the performance.
And I think it was this pressure to have distroy distroken in the pasts in the past.
And if this is true, and I think that is, the question becomes and now?
Can we do it different?
Maybe go back to a more ancient understanding of the relationship between humans and mystery creative understanding.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we can't cell about 500 years of rational thought in a rational talk.
And there is probably people in the audience that would suddenly suspects, you know, you have a woods, you know, you follow people who follow their projects.
I probably don't have to convince you all about this thing.
But the question I want to ask is -- why do I do?
Why don't you think it in this way?
Because it has more sense than any other thing that I've ever heard to explain the exxaperant,
One process like anybody who has ever heard to do something -- so fundamentally, everybody here -- yet, you don't get rational.
And, in fact, it can sometimes completely paranormal paranormal paranormal seems completely paranormal seems completely paranormal paranormal paranormal paranormal paranormal paranormal.
I did this meeting recently with the extraordinary poeter Ruth Stone, but it was a poeter for all life on the whole life and he said that during her her survey in the Virginia, and I felt it out in the camps, and I felt it in the wind when a poety poemed poety of the landscape.
He said it was like a fragorous fragorous fragorotion told me that it was like a fragorous fragorom told me that it was like a fragorous fragorom told me that he was like a fragorous fragorous fragorous fragorous fragorom fragorous fragoreous f.
And that came rolling towards her landscape.
It feels to get there, because he had to get the land under her feet.
He knew to have one thing to do to that point and it was like, "Do it would run as a morn."
And so it was going to home and it was followed by this poem, and it wouldn't get to get a piece of paper and a pretty fastic paper and and a pretty fastic paper and she would tell it and the pastic on the page.
Sometimes he couldn't be enough fast, so corrective and the recorded and sheffort and poems it was going through and poems through and she would kept through the landscape, and she would kept through the landscape, and he said, "another poet."
And then there were the time -- this piece never forget it -- I will never forget -- there were some time that the time was almost perdend, OK?
So, he was running home and he was looking at the card and poetry the poemed through and he was going through the wimming and he said, and then he said, he was like it was like if you get aware and the off.
And he came up with the poems from the tail and the reputting it in his body and transcrowing on the page.
And in these cases, the poems would be presented on the perfect and intact page and intact at the last word at the first one.
So when I felt -- it's crazy, it's exactly the same equal to my creative process to my creative process.
I don't do all my creative process -- I'm not a convict!
I'm a mule, and my way to work is it -- wake up at the same holding every day and southern and southern it up.
But even in my wind in my knews against that thing, I broke it against it.
And I guess that even many of you have handed it to be done.
You know, even if the work and ideas and ideas and ideas they were made me not honestly knowledge it.
And what is this thing?
And how can we relate to this in a way that we don't have the head -- but rather, rather do it to stay health?
And as I reck me, the best example I have is Tom I have the Tom Waits, which I interviewed different years ago for a day.
We were talking about this, and you know, Tom, and you know, Tom, the major of life has been the incarnation of contemporary artist, trying to control, managing these kind of impulses that are totally interior of the totally interior of the cleaning crazy.
But then he was hot and then he was driving on a highway in Los Angeles, he changed everything for him.
He was going to fast, and all of a bunch of a lodia, which is a fragtion of the melodia, which is inspiration, elusive and althcare and and the want, you know, it's wonderful, and you know, it's wonderful, but it doesn't know how to get it.
It has not a piece of paper is not a mathematician has no mathematic.
So it begins to feel this kind of old old old old old old old that the type, and I'll remarry obsessioned by this song.
I'm not quite good enough and I can't do it."
And instead of going to the panic stop.
And he put the whole process and he did something completely new thing.
And he just looked at the sky and said, "Scuse, you can't see I'm driving?"
"You seems to write a song hour?
If you really want to exist, back in a more opportunity when I can get treat yourself when I can get treat you.
Other you have to get somebody else today.
You go to the Leonard Cohen."
And his working process changed after this.
Not the work, the work was still the way as you seed.
But the process, and the fish processing, and the fish released when the genius, the genius that came out of him, and the freedom that would be and freedoms and remaining it was a interior that he had no thing and realizing it was an interior and reminded it was a interior.
but well this piece of work, wonderful bizarre collaboration a conversation between Tom and this strange and external thing that but didn't lose Tom.
So I felt that story began to change a little bit of the way I was working and I was already worked on a time.
This idea, he saved me when I was writing "Mangia, Prega, Ama," and falls of the dispertion that we all have when we're working on something and we began to think that it's going to be a disaster, which is going to be a disaster, which is going to be a disaster book never write.
Not only bad written just written --
And I began to think about design.
But then I remember Tom that I was talking to the air and tried us.
I put my face on my face on the written and I would say, my comments to a corner of the room.
And I told you then, "Yes, what, both both both that if this book not be brilliant not be brilliant not be brilliant not just shouldn't be brilliant, right?
Because as I see I'm going to put all of what I haven't more about that.
So if you want it to be better and improve, you have to give you your party.
Okay. But if you don't do it, I don't know anything about it.
I'm going to write the same because it's my work.
And I'd like to do that was recorded that I today is I presented to me to do my own own own part, because -- the end is so there, OK, and it is so so there, and they were sacred for the long, and sacred and musics that were sacred for the long, and sacred hours and until hours and until hours to the high and the hours to the high of the moon, and the hours of the hours of the moon, and the hours of the moons of the moon, and
And they were always magnific because the ballers, ballers, and they were fantastic and they were fantastic and they were fantastic and they were fantastic.
But every time, rary, really, something happened, and one of these artists became in translent.
And I know you know what I know I know that you have all seen everyone, a performance like that.
It was as if the time stopping and walking through a kind of landscape and walking through a kind of lady and was not several of different from the unus, but everything was alleny.
And suddenly it doesn't just as a human being.
But you access to the diest and under the diest enlight.
And when this happened when this happened, the people who knew what he was, they were they called him her name.
They were the hands and they started sant, "Ah, God God, God, God, God."
That's God, you know.
And they had nice name -- when the Mororian Spaper south of Spana, they took this habitude with them and pronounced centuries from "Ah, Allah, even though him on "Oole, which you can still feel in the correct or flew in the corride or flew in the correct of the bodies or flew this historic.
In Spana, when an artist made something of impossible and magic -- "Oh, oh, oh, hole, hole, and I mean an you have a foot of God.
And it's great because we need it.
But the problem goes the day down, the dancers of the ballery stay and discovers that are the 111 morning, and the last morning, and the God is not there.
It's just a death-bad bad to the knews and maybe it won't be able to get to that altealth.
And perhaps no one cancer the name of God while and it has to do with the rest of her life?
It's hard to it.
This is one of the most painful reconciliations to do in a creative life.
But maybe not to be so ancient to be so angood, if you can not believe, in fact, that the most extraordinary expects of your being from you to yourself.
But beliests just you have data from a incommodata from a indeed, unimaginable, you have to get somebody else when you get somebody else when you find.
And, you know, if we think about it all changes.
And so I started thinking about it, and it's sure as I thought for different months during the book working on the book working on the book that I'm going to public book -- -- the dangerous, the dangerous success.
And what I have to keep on the electric when I feel electric fear that is, not fear.
Don't courage you. It's just your work.
He represents you to you in your parts, whatever it can be.
If your work is ball, dancing, ball.
If the dive, you measure genius to leave some kind of beautiful type of the beautiful time through your effort through your effort through your effort --
Other you do the same dance.
And "Ole!" to yourself.
I think I think it is and I think it out,
"Ole!" to yourself, even for yourself in human love and test talks to to show you continue to do you keep in the way.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
And as you know I've already already talked about some of these projects on human genome, what can meaning and the discovery of genes.
We're now starting a new path and we started digitalizing biology and now started to go from that digital code and now we're going to come into a new phase of biology, designing and synthesizing and synthesizing and synthetic and synthetizing and synthetizing and now to start a new phase of biology and now now
We have always tried to ask questions.
"What is life is something that many biology I think a lot of biology have tried to understand various levels.
We have a different approach, reducing it to the minimum of the terms.
We're digitalizing by almost 20 years old.
When we sequenced the human genome is treated to go from the world world of biology in the digital world.
Now we asked us, can we regenerate the life, or creating new life from this digital?
This is the map of a little organism, the Mycoplasma genitalium, which is the species from the smallest genome of the smallest genome in the lab of the lab.
And we tried to reduce the genome to create a little bit of a smaller to create a smaller even smaller.
We are able to eliminate a hundred genes of the around 500 that are here.
But when we look at a metabolic map, it's relatively easy to us, it's relatively easy respect to us.
I think of them, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminating, one at the time, it's very unlikely that this can bring to a living cell.
So we decided that the only visual to progress was synthesize this chromosomes so that we could modifit to bring some of these fundamental questions.
And so we started the wind of "Can we synthesize a cromoun?"
Can chemistry to produce these big molecules that we have never been able to create before?
And in case business that we can do a cromosound?
A chromosome, is just a piece of chemical material material in chemical material
The speedity we are able to digitalizing life is growing rhythm.
Our capacity of write the genetic code, rather progregreen-to-lenslowly, but it's improving.
And our most recent results the result of the exponential curve.
We started over 15 years ago.
The process has required, many passages, began with a biothic review before the first experiments.
But we found that synthesize DNA is very difficult.
There are decade of thousands of cars in the world that small segments of DNA, of the longer than 30 to 50 to 50 to 50 letters and it's a degenerating process is a degenerative process is that there are longer and herrors there are are one.
So we had to develop a new method to assemble these fragments and rors and rors the mistakes.
And this was our first attempt to go from the digital information of the genome of Phi X 174.
It's a little virus that batteries killed batteries.
We have designed the errors and made the correction of the errors and got a molecule, and I had a DNA molecule.
The interesting is when we have taken this piece of inert material chemical material and we put it in the bacteria have started reading this genetic code and producing virals.
The virals are then released by cells, they have been back back and they have destroy back and have destroy the E.
I talked about recent members of oil industry that they have certainly understanding that they certainly have this model.
They have more than you have a more voice than you.
We believe that this is a situation where software can actually build the same hardware in a biological system.
But we wanted to do things in bigger things in big.
We wanted to build the whole chromosome.
I'm over 580 thousand led code code.
So we thought of built it in the scale of the viruses, so that we could change the cassets to understand what the cassets are a living cell.
The project is crucial and if we start with digital information in a computer, these are must be very accurated.
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 the accuratezing standards, was a mistake for every 10 thousand basis.
We found it, resequencing it, 30 mierrors. If we used that original sequencence. We never have been able to do it work.
One part of the process is designing along the 50 letters that you get out with all the other seats of the other seats that are going to build underunit together to be a little working together.
We do things like a unique elements here.
You probably read that we read the boat.
Think of this: we have a genetic code on four letter: A, C, Green and T.
Three of the tops together in the codifying about 20 women of lectures for every admino-lecture for every adminoid of the lecture for every winding.
So we can use the genetic code to write words, fraise --
What we did in the beginning was automous authorder.
Some of the fact that it wasn't poem.
We have designed these segments for a term of them to be able to just just just with a personal people.
There are gang with them and they put them and put them together.
And we started assembling seed with set seat, starting with segments of five to seven a letter to make 24 miles of lects, and they get to 72 miles to letter to 72 miles a letter to 72 miletter to 72 miles a liters.
And we have produced these drug sequences in abundance so that we can sequence, and we are trying to create a test robbasic proceeded -- how you'll see in a minute.
We're trying to automatize the process.
So it seems to be the tabellons of a basic playland of basket.
When we come back to these very long-basic segments, more than 100 thousand basic will not grow it in E. cooles.
You get to the limited toolds of modern biology biology
So we have other mechanisms.
We knew about another mechanism called omology recombination of biology that in biology is useful to repair the DNA to repair the segments.
Here is an example.
This organism, called Deinococcus radiodurans, can absorbing three million rad rad of rad rad of rad rad of radication.
You can see in the high school require the high school is coming destroy distroken destroy is destroy in the high school is coming destroy in the high school require the high school is going on the high school gally.
In 12 -- 24 hours comes out exactly as it was before.
They have thousands of organisms that have been able to do it.
These organisms can be driven completely several
They can live under empty.
I'm absolutely certain life exists in space, and you move to find new environments of water.
In fact, NASA showed that this available to have this view that this available to say that this avail.
This is a picture of the molecules we built using these process, just using the lievil, by using the design appropriate design.
The lievim that alsembs the automatically.
This picture was not taken with a electronic microscopic microscope microscope microscope microscope was not taken with a regular microscopic microscope with a regular microscopic microscopie.
It's a very big molecule, so that we can see it with a law microscopic microscopie.
These are pictures that cover a period of about six seconds.
This is the published that we did a little time ago.
I'm over 580,000 lectures of genetic code code.
It's the biggest molecules that have ever created by man.
It has a weight molecular on a 300 millions.
If we spend it with a type 10 without spaces, there would be 142 pages just to get this genetic code.
Now, how do we do it work? How can we active,
Of course, you can travel is a game play from kids.
It's a little bit more complicated when they use the bacteria.
It's even as much as it is a cell as well as our eucar cells as our real is: you just extract the other one that is basically the clon.
In the archaea the chromosome, is integrated in the cells, but we recently have shown that we are able to do a complete transplant trapiant trapier of a cell cromosome.
We put a micromosome, a microbial species from a species of microbial species.
The two are different than the men of men tough.
We put some genes in more way that we decide what choosing to chromosom for this chromoom --
And then the sken with the ginger-up and myself in a way that they were killing all the proteins.
And when we put it in the cells in the cells was stuff -- and you appreciate our sophisticatos -- the new crowing in the cell.
And we started thinking we couldn't go beyond it, but we have a common to him.
This is one of the majority mechanisms of evolution.
We found that a lot of the species have added a second or a third of a few hundreds of new hand, a second hands of new tracts to that species.
So who think of evolution as a gene and when you have no lot of the biology has not understood a lot of the biology.
There are glacking glasses, we have DNA.
The chromosome, he didn't have one of it.
The cell phona-is the cromosome we have inserito-ha-good.
You have it expressed and recognized the other chromosome, and it has masticked it with only the cells and we have recognize and the new cromoso.
has become blue because of the genes we have inserved.
And in a short time, all the characteristics of a species are gone in a new species, and it turned from all over a new species, and it turned into the new skin the cell.
all the proteins have changed, the membranes have changed, and when we read the genetic code of what we have transfer to you transfer you.
Now, this may seems alteria, but altering the software DNA we can change things in the things in the enough sustain.
Now, I've already explained that this is not about genesis -- but progress from three million years from evolution, and I said that maybe we're going to create a new version of the Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosion of which you will make new species of digital process.
Why do that?
I think it's enough obvious when we think about our necessities.
We're going to spend six billion and a half billion in the next 40 billion in the next 40 years.
Just to give example, I was born in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for each of the planet for the 1946; there are are going to be four.
We're having problems now to find food and cleanth, water and cleanth, and medicinal and gasoline for six billion people.
It's going to be harder for nine billion.
We can clize more than five billion carbon -- more than 30 billion barrels.
That means millions of barrels to a day.
When we try to find biological processes or any kind of process for replace to replace them, it's going to be a huge challenge.
And the most of the CO2 emission of all CO2 emission of these materials that ended up in the atmosphere.
At the day of the today, because of the scientific discoveries in the world, we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I like to think that are designed for the future.
The electronic industry has only only a dozen about a dozen of components, and think about how many different things have come out.
Our limited is data from biological reality and our imagination.
We now have a technical land of these technical methods of synthesization, in order to create what we call combinatories.
We are able to build a big robots that can produce a million chromosomes a million chromosomes a day.
Think of processing these 20 million different genes or to try to get the processing processes to produce optimize the processes or drugs, we can change and a little team, and creating biology now that in the last 20 years, and create biology now that in the last 20 years.
And it's just a standard selection seleas.
We can choose for chance chemistry of survival, chemistry production of chemistry production of vaccines.
This is a few software programmed with some software programmed to be able to seat, and designing species to the computer.
Well, we don't know necessarily as they will be it.
We know exactly how their genetic code.
We're focusing on the fourth generation.
You see you also see you who extract the eanol of the sky's been a matter experiment experiment experiment experiment experiment of the sky.
We have a second carbon and third generation that will come up pretty soon as a sugar carbon carbon and the highest value of the butans.
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without making a big impact with the cost of the food and limited the disponibility would be transform the CO2 in the material that we're working on designing for cells that we're working on this discopy, and we think we could reach this discover, and we think we could have the first carbons carbonon-half months.
The sunlight combined with CO2 is a methodom -- but in our discoveries all over the world, we found different methods.
This is a organism we described in 1996.
He lives in the deep ocean deep about 2500 feet of water deep eply water temperature of water.
It creates from CO2 using molecular using molecular energy.
We're trying to figure out whether we can put CO2, which can easily be transported to be transported by major carbon carbon in carbon in carbant, to guide this process.
So short we think that we could be able to increase what the basic questions of the basic question, "Well, truly is Now, truly -- we have the goal of otial oil is not about oil industry.
Exactly. If you can't do it from TED, where can I that?
It would become a main source of energy.
And also, we're working for using the same methods to create vaccines --
You saw this year with the influence, we're always behind a year and a dollar, and a dollar, when you treat the right time when you treat the right time.
I think you can change build vaccinable in advances in ancient vaccinable in ancient an.
This is how the future could begin to change it, the evolution, the evolution, accelerating evolution, acceling evolution with synthetical bacteria and then then then then the cell phoneucarots.
We're so so much as much as to improve people.
Our purpose is to live enough to try to do it. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
First of all I'm going to show you the most quickly possible, a fundamental work that we have brought to Microsoft in the Microsoft in a year ago.
This is a environment that you can interact is in the local level, which remote with a huge amount of visual data --
So we're seeing a lot of gabyty photo a very zoom with a kind of zoom and continuous skets and keeping a bread, and I answer the pictures like we want it.
And it doesn't matter how big information is the amount of information that we see -- how big these data data data or images.
Most is communicatal photographs, but this for example is a scanning from the Bilibrary of Congresss, and he comes in the gamount of 300 megapixel.
It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that the prestations of a system as a system of place in your screen on your screen in any moment. It's also a very flexible.
This is a book inter, example of data not images.
This is the Shodesolated Dickens. Every colonn represents a capitole.
And so to show you that it's just a test and I don't have image, we can do something like that, to see that it's a real representation of a real representation of the textbook, not a picture.
It could be a little bit of an artificial book a book electronic book electronic book --
You don't get it up.
This is a more realistic. It's about a number of The Guardian.
Every image is the beginning of a section.
And it really gives you the pleasure and beauty to read the true version of a view or a newspaper of a view or a newspaper of a half half a lot of meeting.
We also did something with the angle of this particular number of the Guardian.
We created a high-resolution advertising higher -- much higher than what you use in a normal advertising content -- and we put you in the extra.
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile, you can see here.
Or other models, or even the specific specific models, or even the specific charges.
And this really shown some of these ideas to eliminate the limites of space on the screen.
We hope that this means to put a pop-up and other porkeries and other porkeries like to be necessary.
Of course, the maping is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology.
And I don't want to lose time, if we don't have a rebutes that we have contributes to give it in this camp.
These are all the streets in the U.S. reposes on a NASA repound image of NASA.
So now we go to something else.
This is actually actually from living on the webs; you can go and see it.
This is a project called Photosynth, which combines two different technologies.
One is Seadragononight and the other is a very interesting research, a student of the University of Washington, with See aid of Washington, with Seliski and of Rick Seliski Research. She has been collaboration.
And it's from living on the web, gestrange.
You can see it when we do this kind of screen that we can go from one picture and have this kind of experience and have this kind of multiply resolution to multiple.
But the space collocaon the image has actually actually a meaning.
The algorithms of visualization have made these pictures together, so that they put the real imagine, so that the real imaginine, where the real imagininject -- all close to the Grashs on Montags -- have been taken down. The chanaist -- you know, whatever see a slides of stable panic, and these things have been college in space.
I don't know if I have time to show you some other environment.
There's a lot more spacal space.
I want to go directly to one of the original data set of the original data from a previous protype of Photosynth that we did work. And this is just to show you what I think is really the key is really the key -- I'm going to show you what I think is -- Photosynth. And it's not necessarily looking at the website. And it's not necessarily in the website.
We had to worry about legal aspects and so on the wind of legal aspects and so on it.
This is a rebuilding in the Cail, the Notre Dame pictures made from Flickr. Basta digitate Notare Dame in Flickr and and you get pictures of the camp, other of the camp, and so on the shake of a picture that you have found a picture that you have found this model.
So they're all pictures from Flickr and have been colleged at the space in this way.
And it's possible to navigate in this simple.
You know, I would never think about finish Microsoft.
It's very gratify to get this kind of engineer here.
I think you can see that it's a lot of different kinds of different kinds of photos in the skets of the SLR, a significant number meaningful number of meaningful set.
And if you can try to get those strange.
Many of them are blocked by doing, etc.
She got a few of photographs -- execcold.
This is a Notre poster of Notre Dame recortly.
We can go from the poster to the view physical poster of this environment.
The essential point is that we can do things with the social environment. This is now taking from all of the memory of view -- from the entire perspective, and college from the point of view -- and it connects together.
All those pictures become together, more of the sames.
You've got a model of the land emerge.
Think of this as a move in Stephen Lawler on the virtual Earth
It's something that grows in complexity as people us, and the people us, and which vantages for who uses to use it with use.
Their pictures are marced with other people.
If somebody is the idea of contransfitting all these spread all these spreads of Notre Dame improven Dame immersed in the name of all those data -- and I can use it as a point of the ingress of the ingress in the universe in that universe, using the space, using the households of anybody else, and have a smooth experience of a cross-s-type experience of the cross-like s-s-cross-s-red experience and cross-s-up and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and cross-s-s-s
In of course, a consequence of all the things are extremely elaborated by any interesting in the land and crawling satellitaries and from satellitaries, but the memories and similar of the collective satellitaries, but by the memories of collective and similar gard, but the memories of the Earth, which is a collective models and and satellitaries, but the memories of the collective models and and and and satellite collective sh and and and and and and and and by the similes,
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I understood OK? What your software will be able to do is that at some point, in the next years, all over the world are shared in the world that everybody in the world are going to be practically connected together?
BA: Yeah. That's what I'm doing is doing is actually discovered.
It's creating hyperline, if you want to hyperline, in images.
And it's doing it in the bottom-content of the images.
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the rich of the seed information of these images can have a lot of these images.
And as you do a research of images on the web, and you degt a sentence and the head on the web has a lot of information about the picture.
Now, what happens if that picture is connected to all of your photos yourself in the wing?
So the amount of interconnection, and the amount of reches that are really enormous -- it's really huge classical effect of the network.
CA: Blaise, it's really incredible.
BA: Thank you very much.
One of the main of the main when you travel and one of the ethopen research is the power that the power that the power of the traditions, between who has no anti-traditions, between who you the pastones in the wind, it takes in the lefavor of the leashion.
By think that the sciamans Jaguar is traveling still beyond the Way, or that the myths of the ancient Dharmad myth, or that in Himalaya, and that in Himalaya, to remember the remind of the anthropoloy of the anthropologie, and that the world we are not exists in sense of the world we are not in sense.
the consequence of a particular choices of adapaptops that our stirps has done one or mal, many generations fout.
And, of course, we all sharing essential trately.
We all have to born it. We all produce.
We're subjected to the beginning.
We have to deal with the death, so we don't surprised us to draw and dallim --
We have a art art.
What it is the rhymm, the rhythm's rhythm's rhythm's range of every culture.
It doesn't matter that they are the Greator of the Boroo, or the followers, or the Warriors of the Kenya sectenterriors, the Curban in Kenya seter's heart in the Sahara.
He was my journey company in the desert of journey in the desert of yak in the Ims of Qomolangma, on Everest, the demother of the world.
All these people teach us that there are other ways of thinking about existing other ways of thinking, other ways of thinking, other ways of moving around the world.
And if you reflect a moment, it's a concept that can give you hope.
Insidle cultures of the world create a ragnaction of the world create a ragnacial and cultural life that has been the planet and is important for the becoming of the planet so as the raise of biological raise biophers.
And you can think about this regnailed cultural ethnose as an ethnose and you can define the ethness of all conceptive ethos of all conceptied, inspirations, intuitions have been from human imagination from the human imagination of the consciousness of consciouse.
The ethnos: The fantastic smokyrimonum of humanity.
It's the symbold-we are and what we can be in as inquisist species.
And because the biosphere was freezing higher on ethnose has been so much more quickly than the ethodly.
No biology, for example, it would say that 50-instance, is about the half the hundred of the biological extinction -- in the most calculus, in the most half of biological diversity -- and you don't even near the most optimistic diversity.
The indden thing is, of course, the persmans of language.
When you were borns there had 6,000 language on this planet.
One is not just composes of a vocabolary or a series of rular rules.
One is the should-hand is the human spirit of human spirit spirit of human spirit spirit spirit of human spirit spirit of human spirit spirit.
It's the meet that the animation of every culture is in the material in the material.
Every lingua is a forest of mind, a wind, a thinking, a thinking, a thinking, a writual ecosystem of spiritual possibilities.
And of those 6,000 languages, as we sat at Monterey, at least half the half is not ssurfaced in the ears of children.
They don't get more teached than children, which means you don't get something, which is already not something that they have died.
What is more than the sad than being flew from the silent to be the last me talking to a language of the tonguage of the avails or of the advances of the children's bad,
And this is a state of a foot in some part of the world every two weeks: every two weeks a faster and leads with standing in the last one tombs of a ancient language.
And I know somebody is going to tell "Is it it is?
The world isn't a better place if we all let the same language?" Benissyn, then we are all yoruba. We all talk about the yoruba.
We talk to kogi.
Scovered of a tract thing means not to talk about your language.
I would like to give you a journey through ethnossphere --
a little journey in ethnose to give you a little journey of what we're lolost.
Many of us forget when I say, "different different ways of exists" inting exists of existers.
We take for example, this Barasy's be, in the setto-like broken population population of the anaconda, which creates to the milar sky's west bread.
It's a population that is not able to distinguishing the blue color, because the blue line is identified in the forest, where the popular is identified in the forest, where it depends on the wind of the popular population.
They have a strange language and a mathematical rule, called "English exopen language -- you must a person who talks about a different language of English language.
All of this has roots in the mythological past, is that in these family extra these extended family are or seven languages because of the mystocks of a language.
They listen to listen and then they start talking about.
We take one of the most interesting tribes I lived with which I lived it, the Waorananciental population that had the first contact in 1958.
In 1957 five mission mission in 195, they had a fact that a fact that was a fact that
They made up from the top of the photographs that they were retled that a locket that population of the plugly population has never seen anything about the biggest has never seen anything about bi-dimensional population had never seen any of the biggest shopping of the photographs that they would forget them in a few of the plug that they would be done that the popular of the plugly maintains of the plug, which was going to be wought
They sat the ground photograph of a shape or a shape or a figura -- not finding anything, they have killed that it was the diable, and they killed the five of the five mission with the lances.
But the Waoranan not just the strangers.
They kill them between them.
The 50 percent of mortality was because of their mortality was caused by them to be there.
We're risalitites and we found two natural death homes and when we insisted for knowledge and when we insisted that one of them was so that one of them was dead, and then they killed it himself.
The cactors were able to recognize the animal from 40 and recognize the animal of the species.
In the first years '80s, I was assigned a very interesting comfortable when my professor of Harvard was asked if I wanted to go to Haiti to intrupholarcing the power of the power of Duvalier and Tonton Macoutes, and I impossessary; and I impossessary's used velenses of the poised velenses of the elenses of the poise.
To give a sense to miraculous, I should understand Vodoubling culture, and that the Vodouldn't understand the Vodddn is not nera.
It's a pretty much of a complex metahasic vision of the world.
Very interesting.
If I ask you to tell me the great religions, what do would you say,
Cristianity, Islam, Buddhism, Enibrush, Enibran.
A continent is always left out, and when you think that Africa is not religious that Africa is not religious that Africa is not religious about these religious concepts of these religious concepts very profound none of the slave of the slave slave of the slavigic slavith.
What makes you interesting the intense is the intense of life and death.
So the vivive him.
The spirits can be invocked by the Great the dance of the dance and dance replacing the dance of the dance and they replace in the way that a short that a short of a short that a short becomes the dio.
For this is the white love to say, "You white love to talk about God.
We dample, and we become God."
And since you are the time you have, is the spirit that you drive, how can you do it with you of male?
So you see this incredible events of these incredible events that you have been charged by tankytizes infurefurection of the mind when it's catalyzed in the body of the body when it's catalyzed in a state of extremely exciting.
I lived with the most peoples I lived in the most extraordinary Kogi is the Kogi Sierra de Santa Marta, in the Santa Marta, in sectentrional Colombia.
Feef of the ancient civilization that once they live on the floor of Colombia in attention of the conquery, the population was reirded on the massive vulcanic planurchase that you were on the massive plan.
In a balanced continent of blood that population has never been conquered by the spagnow.
At all of the today, but their shape is decided, but their shape is decided.
The young people have been taken from the family and three or four years, and they live in a world of good and they live in a world made of good and shadow in the glaciers for 18 years.
Two nine years choices of proposed to reproduce nine months that they turn into the half the mother, now I'm metaphorically in the user of the mother.
For all this time, they come acculated with their society, values that they predict that their prayers and only their prayers and only their prayers -- or to say the balance of equilibrium -- or to say the equilibriucological ecological equilibriucological ecological equilibrium --
And the term of this incredible beginning, they are suddenly taken out and for the first time in life in them, at the age of 18 years, they see a albe. And in that we'll have a albe. And in that sun aware of the first wrony of the beautiful balloons of the beautiful ling in his own spend. The pretty well it comes back and say,
"Do you see how I said, "I detail.
It's just stuff out. It's going to protect it."

This tribe, Cof, Cof, has 17 variety of ayaasca, which are nectly in the forest, and that in our eyes would come in the same species.
If you ask them how stablish their tassonomy will tell us "I thought I was a plant, I didn't know everything?" I didn't know everything?" I didn't know everything?" I said, "No."
The solution is taking 17 variety is taking a filled and each night and each other.

Now, the problem is that also the problems is that the ones of us who have to the indigenes are pitches and they find some way in the margines of the history of the real world and it goes to our real world and spends further.
In fact, the 20th century, in 300 years, it won't be remember for his technologiical innovations, but rather like it was where we stopped and we have embraced and we have embraced to the distruction of biological diversity and the problem of biological diversity and the problem is not change.
all the cultures through the centuries have been involved in a dance for new life.
And the problem is not technology.
The Sioux Indians didn't stopped to be Sioux when they put them out of Americans and freces like Americans have not stopped to be Americans when they put a part of the horder.

Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some things I wrote in this book that I hope I hope I hope and I will try to get some other college college in the case doesn't have born now.
I'd like to start with what I call "the official dog,
The official dog, official dog,
The official dog, the official societies of Western industrial societies "If we want to massimizing the well-being of our citizen."
The reason is from a side side, in the fact that freedom is in the same value, is precious, it's precious, human beings.
On the other is that if we are free, each of us can act to do everything that is to do everything that we have to do everything that our well-being, without any of our well-decided in our name of our well-being,
The way to massimize freedom is to massimizing choice.
More people choice people hanno, more freedom, and greater is their freedom, and more freedom, is their well.
And this is so deeply is so deeply in society that no one would be dream of doubt.
And it's also deeply in our lives.
I'll show you some examples of what the progress has made possible.
This is my supermarket. It's not particularly large.
I put a simple named just on the condiments for insaves.
In my supermarket there are 175 conditions, without contact 10 varietes of oil and 12 acets of oil and 12 acets you can buy for a huge number of of samic conditions, and the 175 already already is in the circumstances of your degree.
Here is the supermarket.
And then you go to the electronics to buy a stere: casses, lector CD, radio, plastonishing.
And in this single negotiates of electronics, there's a big number of audio of audio components.
We can do six million different and a half million different combinations of different combinations that there are just a negotial.
You have a lot of choice that there is a lot of choice.
Other camp: the world of communications.
One time, when I was a child, you could get all the service of the cell phones wish cell phone that they were myth, packly.
He read the phone; you didn't buy it out.
One consequence of that, in the other one was that the telephone don't break out.
These are the time I went to it.
We've got a variety of phones, especially between cellphones, especially between cellphones in the cellphones --
Here is the mobile phones of the future.
My favorite is in the middle of the MP3, sket, and the holds in the hundred for the crash myself.
If you have not seen it in the house store in the home, you're beautiful, you know, you're going to get it to pretty much --
And what the end happens is that people come into the negozurezation and does this question and do this question. And you know what the answer?
It's not possible to buy a cell phone;
So in other aspects of life that are much more important than the waters, you will be the same explosion of choices.
Science healthy not happens in the United States that you go from doctor and the doctor and the doctor and the doctor and the doctor and the doctor you have to do.
Instead, you go from the doctor says, "Oh, we could do A, we could do A, or B." "As it has these benefit and these answers and these risks. And what do you want to do?"
You say, "Doc, what should I do?"
And the doctor says, "It has these goods, and Bs has these answers."
"What do you want to do?"
And you rebat it, "Dottor if she was me, what to do?"
And the doctor: "But I am I'm not lei."
The result we call it the malato," expression that it makes it seems a beautiful thing.
But it is not that one is that a weight and responsibility to take decisions from somebody who knows somebody who knows nothing to somebody else -- and so that doesn't know -- and so in the ideal conditional conditional to take the patient decient.
There's a huge marketing products drugs, I direct people like me and you, if you think about people like me and you know, if you think it has no sense, because we can't buy it have no sensed by drugs.
But if we can't buy them, why do you public them?
The answer is that they want doms doctor we call the doctor to change the recipe of the recipe.
Something of so fundamental is our identity has has been choice, as you see in this vignet. We don't want to force the children. We don't want to force their sex sex to the right moment.
And we can reinvented us how many times we aggreat.
The means that every morning you have to decide that every morning, you have to decide that kind of person wants to be.
Rispace, a family and the marriage, a common perspective -- unfound almost for anyone for anyone, it was that you could get the most pretty soon as possible, and it started the pretty much as possible,
The only real choice was with choice was with it, not the one -- and not even what to do later.
Ogay, everything is really play.
I teach them very smart students, and I think about 20 percent less than a time.
And because they're not less brilliant, because they're not less diligents.
but why I'm impensiers, I mean I mean I mean, "I should want to do it now?"
"Do I have to get a little bit of a tardie?
They're interrupt interrupt of logorients.
And they try to answer these questions, even though that imply don't completely get a tasset and not get a well with my exam.
And they really have to do that. They're really important.
Now, the work: we have lucky, like Carl technology allows us because technology allows us to work every day, from every single of the planet, trans that from Hotel Randolph.
Twentess, there's a corn, and I'll tell anybody where, where WiFi works.
I don't say that, because I want to use it ye.
What does this mean, this incredible freedom of choice that we have to work on the work? Is that we have to decide, if we have to work or not.
We can go to the hot our boy play hot with the mobile phones in the task, and the news and the news and the kneedly.
And even though they're all pushing on the baby's boy that we see our boy walking the game, we're also asking this called the away?"
"I have to answer this email? I have to ablead this letter?"
And even when the answer is "us," all this makes the experience of your child lots of different tures from what it would be in other conditions.
So, from any part of it, little things and we have small and large objects and big, life is a matter of choices.
Once the world was this: Obe, there were some possibilities, but it wasn't all a choice.
The world today, is like this: The dilemma is, "I’m a good thing -- "It's a good thing -- or negative negative now?"
The answer is Shim.
The positive sides we know all of the negative negatives of the negatives of the negatives of the negatives of the negatives of the babys.
All this choice has two negative effects two negative effects on people.
The first one, paradoxiety is producing paralsaving instead of liberation.
And so many options that you choose the choose, it becomes very hard to do it.
I give you an example meaning: a study of mean on planets on plans of volunteers.
One of my colleagues had access to the Vancers, the gigants of the sources of though, with about a million clients in 2,000 different companies.
What she found is that for every 10 10 solutions that are offered by each 10 solutions that are offered over 2-year-old adesion.
With 50 sources there is 10 percent less than when they have been available to when they have available only 5. Why?
Because with 50 sources that choose, is maledetailly hard decide, and choice is remained to the inomors.
And at the questions, and asking questions, questions, and questions, questions, and of course questions, and of course won't doing.
You know, it doesn't just mean that these workers are going to be able to have food for canoes because they don't have enough money, it also means that decision is so ostick the hostic sources of work.
Don't participand they're losing to 50, a year from the data of work, which would be well disposed.
So the paralysis is a consequence of having choice to have choices.
And I think it makes the world like that.
"And finally, for ethoketicch, or whatever?"
You would just take the right decision, if it's for ethnity, right?
You don't want to choose the wrong source, and you can't get the wrong condition
So this is the first effect. The second is that even if we can avoid the paralysis, and we do a choice, and we are less with less options of how we would have been with less options that you have been with less options that you choose the choices.
And this for different reasons.
One of these is that with a lot of conditional fingered that if you buy one and it's not perfect, it's easy to imagine that you could have a different choice that you could have been better and better than it would be be better than it was going on in the choice, and the top, and the top, and the tops of the choice, and the recognized the pressure of the pressure that you could have a pressure decision
even when it was a good decision.
More choices us -- the more choice than anyone details that it's insoddispieces of choice.
But also, there's what economists are called the cost-opportunity.
Dan G: Do asked a very well stamacine as the value that we are with what we confrontive things we confrontive it.
In the rest of that, when there are many options of the options of the alternative options of the alternative options of the option that you have choice.
Here is an example. I suspect with all the ones that are not New York.
But it's what you probably thought.
There's this couply to Hamptons.
A place of luxish.
It walks beautiful spleny. It's all about them.
Not nothing. But what he thinks is "Well, the maledition, is Augosto."
"Everybody in Manhattan are alized."
"I could talk to the right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right front of my front of home."
And it turns two weeks away from the idea that persing -- every day -- every day is that it perhaps to be floating where it wants to be losing where it wants.
The expensive opportunity diminises the soddisfation for what we have, even when the choice was excellent.
And the more is the options we have to consider it, the more characteristics will be background against how expensive it against how expensive is the opportunity.
Here is another example.
This vignets says a lot of things.
It talks about the live moment, and maybe living slowly.
But the most important point is that any choice, you choice, you choose not do others.
The things that we don't choose have a lot of four that can make less attention, what we do.
I mean, it is growing to growing expectations.
I tried on my skin my skin bought a new jeans.
I have almost jeans.
Once the jeans were one guys of the bestive and clothes and clothes were bestive and a best, they were just brought a life and worked on a lot of times, they began to go good.
So I went to buy a couple of new when the old old old ones were going, and I said, "I myself a couple of jeans, this is my cute."
The comfort told me to me, "Li wants to them to be slim fit?"
Would you like to do it or with the bottons or the bottons or "Stonebond," or "Is it it?
"Liken you want it to the street?"
"Sotbulken you or stretty? Bla blail?
I was standing up and after a little I was able to say, "I want the type -- I mean, "I want to have a single -- I was so so for a time I was so so I was a jeans, and then I went out of the jeans, and then I went out of the best jeans, I was the best jeans, I had ever happened.
He was the male one. I had the choice had the best I had the best hand.
But I felt worse --
Why? I wrote a book for understand it.
The reason I was worse with the worse is that with all the choice was that choice were altitism altism was perfects.
And I started expectations I didn't expectations that I was expectations when you existed only one guys there was a perfect. But when you see 100 different in the same waiting as a perfect.
What I had water was good -- but not perfect.
After the choice I was choice with what I was trying to put what I was looking for it.
The add options in life of people don't have to increase expectations that these have respects.
And this will be less sodsatisfied when the results are good ones.
None in the world of marketing it in the world of the marketing world of it.
Because if you know it, you won't know what I'm talking about.
The truth is a more like this.
"She was better when he was worse when it was worse." The reason he was worse when it was worse when it was worse when it was worse there was still possible to meet the surprising surprising the surprised.
Today, in the world that we live -- opulws, industrialized citizens with the expectancy -- the male that we can hope is that we can hope is that things are at the height.
You never have to be sursurprised because your voices expects, my expectancy expectancy --
The secret of happiness -- what you're here -- "Basses expectancy -- "Yeah, h."
I mean, little bit of a half at the cartoon -- which is really married and my wife is really wondered.
I didn't have a better him, I didn't have any better, I didn't accounted it.
But I don't always have a bad thing.
And finally, a consequence of buy jeans comfortable when there is only that kind of jeans is that when you're not satisfact, and you wonder, and you say, "Why?"
"Who is responsible?" "What's clearly.
The world is responsible. What could I do about that?
When there are hundreds of jeans, and you buy a insodded, and you ask you who is responsible for you who is responsible that you are responsible to you like the responsible you to be there.
You could have to do better.
With hundreds of variety of variety -- there are not for insuccess.
So when people take decisions, even if the outcome, you feel that result is valike, you feel in their own and they give them a hit the colpe to themselves.
In the last few years the depression is exploded in the industrialized world industrialized world.
I think a matter -- not the univer, but it's important -- not the unique, but it's important -- of this depression is that people have depression experiences because the standards are too high.
And when they explain this situation think that the colpe is them --
So the final result is that in general is that we're worth better, objectively, but we feel worse we feel at it.
Let me remind you you --
This is the official dog, what we all take for good and it's completely falso.
There's no doubt that a little bit of choice is better that haven't been a lot of choice is a lot better than a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of choice that you don't have a lot of choice that you don't have a lot of choice that it doesn't have
There's a critical value, magic value. I don't know what it is.
But I'm sure we have overcome from a piece of the piece that choices are the choices that choices our lives.
Now, from the political point -- I have almost finished -- from the political point of view is the following point.
What it allows all this choice in the industrial society is the material society is the material society.
There are many places in the world, and you know that there is not a lot of places that have not choice.
The problem is that they have too population.
So the fact that I'm talking about is a malesclusive modern, which is a western exclusive societies.
And what it makes and arrabbing is this -- Steve Levitt has talked about yesterday about how those expensive and seats are inuseful. It's a spreadless of money.
I mean, complicated and dispendful, complicated and dispendous, it's not just useful.
They are deleted deleters.
They have to be worse with worse --
If a little bit of what in our societies allows us was reversed in those where people have too poors have too poors that they have too chance to be improve but also now.
This is what economists are called a paretian paretian paretian paretian
One red-redistribution, not just to the poor -- not just the poor -- because of this choice that it comes back to the poor --
And he said, "Fole, you can become all you want, you can become all I mean,
And I mean, you know, people of culture, you know, what that weight is that weight fis?"
"It's obvious that you can't do anything in a glass of glass glass."
"As imagination, a couple of the world."
and I had it recovered it to the beginning.
But then, I think about it, aging I realized that that weigh weight down the long.
Because the reality of the fact is that if you keep in the franks, so that "everything is possible." You don't get freedom. You get the freedom.
If you break the mouth so that all becomes possible diminusely decreation.
You can get the paralysis, and you reduce the well-being.
They all need a sphere.
This is almost certainly too stret; perhaps even for us.
But the absence of some symbolic symbolic symbolic symbolic pattern, for the roll.
Thank you very much.
