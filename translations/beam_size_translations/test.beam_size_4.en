Part years ago, here at TED, Peter Skillman introduced a challenge of design called the marshmallow.
And the idea is very simple.
The four people have to build the most people have to build the highest possible that you can reduce it alone, using 20 spaghang meter.
The marshmallow needs to be stuck in the top.
And even though it looks very simple, because it's quite difficult because they covers people to collaborate very quickly.
So I thought it was an interesting, and I incorporated it in a laboratory about design.
And it was a huge success.
And since then I organized about 70 labs designs of this kind of around the world with students, designers and architects, designers and architects and development companies Fortune of the companies of Fortune 50.
There's something in this exercise that reveals reveals on the nature of collaboration, and I'd like to share some of these lessons.
But, most people start with the orienting to orienting towards the compit.
They talk about, you know, you imagine what it might expect, they spend the power, then they spend the planning time planning, organizing.
They make sketches and prices.
They run a majority of the time devices assembling the spaghetti in structures and growing and the end, just when the time is to scader, some of the marshmallow, and they fly the marshmallow, and Ta-da!
They love the job.
But what happens is, most of the time, most of the times, is that the "Ta-day," because the marshed of a Uh," because the marshmallow makes the whole structure.
There is a number of people who have many more moments of the huh-oh moment, and the worst there are neolaureated businesses.
Mentono, cheat, you distragge, and they create absolutely transbal structurely transballs.
And there are naturally groups that have much more structure-to-days, by the miles of childhood schools.
And it's incredible.
As Peter says Peter, not just create higher structures, but they're also the most interesting structures.
And your question will be possible? What's possible? What do they have particular?
And Peter love to say, "No one of the kids spent time trying to become the Spage of Spage Spage A."
They don't spend time competing for the power.
But there is another reason.
And the reason is that the economy students are formed to find the single best project.
And then I get it.
And after that, what happens is that when they put the marshmallow in the top, they have no longer, and what happened?
crisis.
It's familiar? Right.
What children are doing differently, is that they start from the marshmallow, and they build prototypes, one after the other, keeping the marshmallow, they have different chances to add prototypes.
The designers recognize that this kind of collaboration is the essence of the Iterative process.
And with any version, children have a feedback of what works.
So the ability to work on prototypes, but we see how they work different groups.
The average for most people are about 50 hundred feet, for the economic students about economics, about the met, and a little bit better, but not much, children, better than many adults.
Who does better than everything?
Architd and engineers, thank you to the sky.
9/nine is the highest structure that I've ever seen.
And why? Because they understand that triangles and geometric models are the key to build structure.
Then we have the general directors, a little better than the average.
But here's where it becomes interesting.
If you include an administrated, the group can make a lot better.
It's incredible.
Because they have particularly more in accomplishing the altrure.
They understand it.
And all the groups that are running and pay attention to work improving the result of the theam.
Too special and acagulation, and their combination bringing a safe success.
If you have 10 groups that are usually working well, you will perhaps six that will have structures.
And I tried an interesting experiment.
I thought, let's stopped.
I put it on 10,000 dollars in software prizing.
What do you think about design?
What was the result?
This is what happened.
None of the team has created a stable structure.
If one of them made a framework from 2.5 cm, it would brought back homely.
Isn't that interesting is that an impact so string?
We tried again, the exercise with the same students.
What do you think this happened?
Now they got the value of a prototype.
The same team, from the worst has become the best one.
They created the highest structure in the minor time.
So they're important lessons on the nature of incentives and the success could you ask the time to write a marshmallow?
The reason is this: help create digital tools and make digital tools to help groups build cars, video games and visual effective.
And what a marshmallow is to help to identify the nose assumption of the nose assumption.
Because, honestly, every project has his marshmallow, isn't it?
The challenge is a shared language, a common language, a common to build a prototype.
And so, this is the value of the experience of this simple exercise.
And those of you who were interested in, it can go to marshmallower challenge.com.
It's a blog where you can take a look at how to the marshmallow.
There are past educations.
There are crazy examples from all over the world on how people correct and upside the system.
There's also the world record of the world.
And the most importantly, I think, is that design is that design is really a sport.
It requires the footage of all the sense, and the useful of reasons, the feeling and manuality to run the challenge that has in your hand.
And sometimes a little prototype of this experience is everything that is necessary necessary to transform a "huh-day."
And that can actually make the difference.
Thank you very much.
We are finally going to have here a machine, beautiful car, in the TED stys at TED, is a time machine.
Everyone in this room have to get it.
You can go back, you can go a; you can't stay where you are.
And I would be curious to know what you would choose because I asked my friends in the last time, and they all want to go back.
I don't know. They want to come back before they were Twitter or Twitter or "Idol."
I don't know.
I am convinced that there is a kind of return to our algia, to the likeep.
I understand it.
But I'm not part of that group, I have to admit it.
I don't want to go back, and because I'm not going to come back and why it is because the chance on this planet don't go back.
So I want to go into the car and I want to go on.
This is the best time that there was on this planet in every field that we can measure, wealth, mobility, mobility, mobilized, chance of disease.
There has never been a period like this.
My great-grandfathers die -- everybody, first 60 years.
My grandparents spent that number of 70.
My parents are to touch the 80.
So it's better than there is a nine at the beginning of my death.
But it's not just about people like us, is a much bigger than that.
A child in New Delhi today can be expected to live as much as the richest man in the world of 100 years ago.
Think about it. It's an incredible.
How does it be it?
smallpox. The smallpox killed billions of people on this planet.
He changed the demography of the global war has been done.
If you were born gone.
We have concern it can be same.
In the rich world threatening millions of people only one generation does not exist.
Difterite, rusoly --
someone still knows what they are it?
Faccines, medicine, our capacity to feeding billions of people, these are triumples of the scientific method.
And the second me, the scientific method, trying to things, see if they work, change when they don't work, is one of the great results of humanity.
These were the good news.
Unfortunately, they were the uniques because there are other problems, and they have been quoted a lot of times one of them is that, although everything that we've got, a billion people on this planet, every day.
This number is growing, with incredible rapidly, and it's very quickly true.
And not only we used our creativity to fill the planet.
Wather pockle, land far, rainforests and pluvial: they're disappeared, and they are disappeared, and they are disappeared, and if we don't met our actions to pull us out from this guy.
So the question is: can we do it? I believe yes.
I think it's clear that you can make food for feeding billions of people without violent the earth that they living.
I think it's possible to revive this world of energy without that this destroy.
I really believe it, and it's not an illusion.
But here is the thing that holds me in the night -- one of the things that tend me up the night,
We never had so need scientific progress as we need right now, but we need now, and we have never been in the position of how we might today.
We are at an incredible event, really, in many ambites.
But despite this, I think we should go to side, 300 years, before the Illuminism, to find a time that we fighting the progression that we fighting the progression that we are fighting the most fronts, than we do.
People are trapping in what I believe, and they do with a lot of force that we can't free.
It can be able to liberate it.
Listen, everyone have right; they have right; they also have righted to the opinion about progress, but you know what you haven't righted?
You've got no right to your facts.
I put a little bit to understand it.
A decade years ago, I wrote a story about vaccines for "The New Yorker," a short article.
And I was stupid that some opposing that it was contrary to what it is, after all, the most effective public health of all human history.
I didn't know what to do, so I did as usual, I wrote the story and I went to other.
Not much later, I wrote a story about genetically modified.
Same thing, just bigger.
People were crazy.
So I wrote a story about that, and I couldn't understand why people considered the GM as "mostrok" because they thought that to move the molecule in specific ways, instead of case, instead of case, instead of case, instead of case, it was to invade the field of nature.
But, as I do my job. I wrote the story and I went on.
I mean, I'm a journalist, we wrote a cend, let's go and cended up there.
But these stories were tortured and I couldn't understand why, but I did.
The problem was that those fanatics that they were doing crazy not fanatic.
They were consciousness, educates, people for good.
They were exactly how people in this room.
And the thing was disturbing me --
But then I thought, ways, we have to be honest on this planet, where we don't have the same relationship with the progress that there was one time.
We talk about the environment.
We talk about the ironic terms of using these virgolds: "Progress," "Progress" OK, there are reasons to do that, and I think we know what they are.
We have lost confidence in institutions, and sometimes in the science itself, and it is understood that it has happened.
You just do just some names and people understand it.
Cnobyl, Bhopal, Challenger, Viox, the Challenger, Viox.
I mean, each one has his list.
We have questions and problems with the people that were thinking about it.
So you sit skeptics.
Wake question, pretend answers, pretend to try it.
Don't give anything to that.
But here is the fundamental point: when the evidence to accept it, and we're not very good at this.
And I think that the reason is that we are in a fear epidemic of that I had never seen and hope I don't share it.
About 12 years ago was published a story, a story, a story, a story between autism and the bond vaccines of autism and vaccines against death, parotite vaccines.
Very frightening.
Those of studies were made to see if it was true.
And they had to do hundreds of studies; it's a important.
And they came up with the data.
They came from the United States, from England, from the Canada, from the Canada, and all of them were equal, no correlation, no correlation, no correlation of nothing.
He didn't make it difference. Not because we think about anecdos, to what we see -- -- what we think we can see, to what we think about real feel.
We don't think of an documents from the government that show us numbers from the government that show us numbers, and I realized, I think we all understand it.
But you know what?
The results have been devastanted --
Now devastating because here's a face: The United States are one of the few countries in the world where the number of vaccines against the death.
It's horrible, and we should be revergone of us ourselves.
It's terrible.
What's happened that it took us to do something like that?
Now, I understand it.
Think of it, somebody here has the death?
Anyone in the audience has ever seen a death?
It doesn't happen.
In this country doesn't happen, but it happened 160,000 times in the world last year.
I'm a great deaths for a death.
But since it did not success here, we can take it from my head, and people like Jenny McCarthy can go around and ignorance and ignorance from palcoscenes like Oprah Larry King Live.
And they can do it because they don't understand the difference between causality.
They don't understand that these two things seem to be hugual, but I don't know.
But it's something that we need to learn, and we need to learn it fast.
This man was a hero, Jonas Salk.
It has liberated the humanity from one of his flags.
No fear, no fear, no sufferings -- the polyer -- disappeared.
The man at the center, not higher.
It's called Paul Offit.
It's just created a vaccine against the rotabus together to other people.
He saved 400, 500 mile mile in the developing countries in the developing world.
But, right?
It's either, if it wasn't that Paul goes around to talk about vaccines, it says how praying and that people should just stop.
And it tells it in these terms.
So Paul is considered a terrorist.
When Paul talks about an audience can't testimonce.
They call it to the house because I want to remind that they know where his children go to school.
Why? Because Paul has created a vaccine.
I wouldn't need to say that, but the vaccines are fundamental.
If we stopping them, terrible disease, and it's going on.
We have the death.
And it's going to be worse and not a lot of the children will begin to die again, because it's just a lot of number.
And they're not going to die of death.
Can poly? Right. Why do we do that?
A colleague of the college was written about a couple of weeks ago, and he told me that it was a little bit of except to it.
No one had said before.
She wouldn't vaccinated his son against the polyo.
No.
OK.
Why? Because there's no polio from us. But you know what?
Yesterday, we didn't have the polio in the United States.
Today I don't know -- maybe a guy is salion an aircraft on an airplane in Lagos and is coming to Los Angeles, now is on the Ohio.
And maybe it's going to be going to read a couple of hours, it's going to get here in Long Beach and stasage to one of these fantastic cene organized from TED.
He didn't know it was infected by a paralyzing disease, and we don't know it because it's how the world.
This is the planet in which we live in. We don't do it until it is.
We address surround. We love it.
Are you all the livamin?
Echinacea, a little bit of antiossiants to start the day.
I know you did it because the half of the Americans do it every day.
They take that stuff, as they affect the alternative medicine, and no matter how often we demonstrate that they are useless.
The data will always show it.
They have the smaller urine. The smaller of this won't do itself.
But it's good, you want to spend 28 billion dollars per urbin school, are with you.
Urina school.
Why do we do that? Why?
I think I can figure out, housing the great drugs.
We have the great government machine. We don't trust it.
And we do good. Our healthcare system.
It's cruel to millions of people.
It's absolutely, incredibly cold and death for those of us who can afford it.
And so we get away and away from who we refugee?
We stand in the big placebel.
It's cool. We love the great placeb.
You know, it's a serious problem because this is a slavery, and we spend billions of dollars.
I have a whole series of examples here.
No one of this -- a from, echinacechinacea -- a from. And I don't know what it is but we spend billions of dollars, and it's a from.
You know what? When I say these things, people stand I say, "What do you interesting?
It makes them way."
You know, you have a little bit.
Because I'm not interested in whether it's the secretary of the Department for the Salute and the Uhm,
When we immouse that leads to to replace science and evidence with magic and tradition, we end up in a place where we wouldn't be.
Let's do it as Thabo Mbeki in South Africa.
He killed 400 miles of his boundaries continuing to say that barbabetes, celines work better than some of the anti-retroviral drugs.
There was hundreds of thousands of inutilized deaths in a country that has been brought over every other than this disease.
Please don't come to tell me that there are no consequences for these actions.
There are seed: There are always there.
Now, the most stupid epidemic that we are in the middle of the sustainers of genetically modified foot and the elite of the genetically modified food.
This is an idiot. It has got to end.
It's a diatridge on the metaphor.
It's ideology, it's not science.
Every single thing that we eat every chick, every chick, every leaves of the Bruxelles was modified by man.
You see, there were no handle in the garden.
There were no melance.
There were not even the Christmas.
We did it over the last 11,000 years.
Something worked and something else.
And we have eliminated what I didn't work.
Now we can do it more precisey.
And there are some of the risk of that they are.
But we can put things like vitamin A in the rise, and it would help millions of people, promoting their lives.
And we don't want to do it?
I have to tell you, I don't understand it.
We are contrary to the OGM.
Why?
The things that I feel always like chemicals, pesticides, pesticides, pesticides, we don't want to the enormous camps with the same thing, it's wrong.
We don't want the companies to put short on life.
We don't want the companies are unique.
You know what my answer to this?
It's yes. You've got right. Let's do something.
It's true, we have a huge food problem, but it's not science.
It has nothing to do with science.
It's light, morality, lines on the short of the shortvessels.
You know that science is not a corporation.
It's not a country.
It's not even an idea; it's a process.
It's a process, sometimes gives sometimes positive results sometimes no, but the idea that we should not allow the science of doing because we fear is actually very lab, and it's really very lab, and it's getting millions of people to prosperate.
You know, in the next 50 years, we're going to produce 70 percent of food in more than we produce 70 percent.
These are investments in Africa of the last 30 years.
Vergoically.
They need and need us and we don't do it.
Why? Can genetically modified.
We don't want to encourage people to eat slavery.
A billion people eat.
It looks like a little path.
But, it's just calculories.
It has no nutrient, it has no proteins, but scientists are finding the way of inserircelles right now.
So many people could eat and run less the risk of becoming blind.
They won't they famine, and you know what?
It would be very beautiful. It wouldn't be a restaurant, but it would be very beautiful.
I'm going to ask just to ask myself, why are we count?
I mean, let's kick this thing? Why are we obstacking this thing?
Just why don't we want to move the genes and there?
It's about to move genes. It's not about chemicals.
It's not about our obsession for the ormons, or our desire to have greater food, better food.
There is no Rice Krispies.
It's about rescue of people, and it would be now that we start to understand what it wants.
Why do you know? -- if we don't understand it? -- if we don't understand it, and we continue to change how we put it right now, we're going to be clear, colonialism technology.
There's no way to describe what is going on.
It's egoist, it's horrible in front of us, and we have to stop it.
So, after this very fun conversation conversation, you could ask myself, "You still want to go into this redistrong and go to the future?
Yeah! Of course I want.
It's blocked on the present right now, but we have an incredible opportunity.
We can get the machine of time as we want.
We have a chance to go where we want, and we're going to really where we want.
We have to do these conversations, and we have to think, but when we go to the car and we go to be happy to do it.
I know that we can say, as much as I think that the world needs to be.
Thank you.
Thank you.
On one day, the chronist from the Los Angeles Steve Lopez was walking for the streets of Los Angeles when he heared a great music.
It was from a man, a man, a human-American man, fascinating, fascinating, with the marcats, without dimore, that she had two cors.

Nathaniel left the Juilliard, had a terrible exhauriment of nervous, and 30 years later, she lived in the middle of the streets of Skid Row in the middle of Los Angeles.
I reached all of you read Steve the book of Steve or look at the movie to understand not just the beautiful link that created in these two mans.
My name is Jane McGonigal. I'm a video game.
To games from 10 years and my obbietary for the next decade for the next decade is trying to make the world the world in the real life:
To do that I have a plan, and consists in convincing more people, including you, you spend all more time playing games and interesting.
So we spend three billion hours a week playing online.
Some of you might think, "It's a good time passed to play it."
maybe too long time, considering how many problems we have to solve we have to solve in the real world.
Actually, in my research, I pressed for the Futuro, actually is the contrary.
Three billion hours a week are not enough.
In fact, I think that if we want to survive the next century on this planet we have to increase remarkable.
I have calculated that the total we need is 21 billion hours of play every week.
It's probably an idea a very counterintuitive, so the repeat, so the repeat, to repeat.
If we want to solve problem, poverty, climate change, global climate change, global warming, obesity, I think we need to have the environment of playing online, for at least 21 billion hours at least at the end of the next decade.
This is why. This image reassume because I think to play is so important for the survival of the human species --
This is a rate of the Phil photographer Phil Toldan, wanted to catch the emotion.
So he photographed of the players as they were playing.
And this is an emotion.
If you are not used to be players of this picture.
You can probably notice the sense of urgence, a little fear, a little fear, but also a very deep, a very deep attention, a very difficult.
If you are used to play some details, you notice the details around the eyes, and around the eyes, and around at the eye are optimism.
And the skulls sarrate show.
This is an abitual player at a step from something called a "Victorial Vittoria Epic."
Ah, it's a term that you've already heard.
So we have the abitual players between us.
A victory is an extraordinarily positive that you don't seem to be able to when you don't get it to you when you don't get it.
It's almost beyond the shock of the imagination, and when you get is a shock to find what you're really about.
This player is at a step from an epical victory.
And this is the expressure we need to see about millions of resolutions of problems in the world as we deal with the next hundreds of the next hundreds of annininights, it's a step from a torial torepic.
Unfortunately this is the expression that we see in the life of all the days as we deal with the urban problems.
This is the expression that I call "I'm not Bram." And I'm going to do it.
I am with the "I'm not Brently Realtyalty."
This is a graffh in my old neighborhood of Berkeley, in California, where I did the PhD in the real life.
And this is a lot of the players that we actually feel that at the fact we are not good at the games.
And I don't mean "bravi" just as "success" -- even though the success is particularly, we get more results in the online.
But I also mean "braves" in the sense of motivated to do something important, inspired to collaborate and cooperating.
And when we are in a world honline, I think a lot of us becomes the best versions of ourselves, the best versions of helping without prediction, more capable of focusing on a problem for all the time.
And in the real life when we face a failure, when we deal with an obstacle, we often don't feel like this: we feel anxiod, we feel anxiod, perhaps depressed.
We never provide these feelings, while I call, just not exist in a game.
So this is what I wanted to study at university.
What is that in a game we can not get any result?
How can we transport those feelings from games and apply them in the world.
So I studied games like World of Warcraft, which is really the ideal environment to solve problems.
And I began to notice some things that make the epic that so possible in the online.
The first is that, when you looked in one of these games of online, especially in World of Warcraft, there are a lot of different characters that provide to save a mission to save a mission to save the world.
But not qualsia: a perfect mission, a perfect mission in your game. Right?
So you can complete.
They never give you an impossibly possible.
But it's at your skills. So you have to try and seriously.
But there's no disock in World of Warcraft, you don't spend the time to turn on the chickens, there's always something specific and important to do.
And there are many collaborators.
Anyway, hundreds of thousands of people, ready to joining your whole epical mission of your epic.
It's not so common in life in the real life, this feeling that we have a lot of collaborators.
And there is this epic, this narrative, this narrative that inspire, because we're there, and what we're doing.
And then we get this feedback positive --
You've heard about increasing levels of force, and one in intelligence.
We don't get that kind of feedback in real life.
When I leave this stage is not going to have a talk about the audience, and you have a bizarre in bizarre ideas.
I don't get that kind of feedback in life.
Now, the problem of collaborative environments like World of Warcrafty is that gives so much soddisfation to a step from a liver liver lives, that we decide to move all of our time in these games.
It's better than reality.
That's why of the World of Warcrafting all players from Warcraft have spent 5,93 million years to solve the virtual problems of Azeroth.
This is not necessarily a negative thing.
But let's put it in perspective: 5.93 million years ago was the time in which one of our ancestors.
That was the first primary.
OK, so when we talk about how long we are investing in play, the only way we are investing in the playing, the only way we are designed with human evolution, which is an extraordinary thing -- because we found that we're changing all this time playing, we're changing what we're able to play, we're changing what we're able to play more and more heart.
This is true, I believe that.
Think of all this interesting statistics.
It was published by a researcher to college Mellon.
The typical young average today in a very strong culture, it will have spent 10,000 hours play online, will have spent 10,000 hours play online, at the age of 21 years.
10,000 hours is an interesting number for two reasons.
First of all, for the children in the United States 10,080 hours is the exact number of hours that I spent from the fifth if you're present all of the day.
So we have an entire parallel of parallel education in which the young people learn how to be bad.
And some of you have probably read the new book of Malcolm Gladwell, "Fuorlasse."
If you have done it by his theory, the theory of 10,000 hours for success.
It's founded on a very good research in the cognion, that if we are dedicating 10,000 hours of the fruiting at 10,000 hours in that field.
We'll be good at that something as the best people in the world.
So, what we now have now to have a whole generation of young people who are the genes.
So, the question is: "Hey, in what they become good at these toys.
because if we could figure out what this is going to have a amount of human resources without previous precedentented.
This is the number of people in the world spending an hour to play online.
These are our genes.
500 million people who are extraordinary,
And in the next decade we will have another billion players that are extraordinarily good at that are extraordinarily good at that something.
If you didn't know it, this is what it expect: the video game industry is developing platforms developing platforms that will grow power and work with the cellular network instead of players all over the world, particularly in India, China, Brazils can be wonline.
The estimate is a billion players in the next decade.
This will bring us to 1.5 billion acabitual players.
So I started thinking about what these games are transforming us into genes.
These are four aspects that I have individual. The first is a very good urgent urgy.
Okay. Think about it as a remarkable form of self-motivation.
A optimism is the desire to act immediately to deal with an obstacle, with the conviction of having a reasonable hope of success.
The abitual players believe that a life; it is always worth that a liver is worth to try and try it.
The abitual players are not with hands.
The abitual players.
There is a lot of interesting interesting research, how we find more people after played with them, even though they brought us.
And the reason is that it takes a lot of people to play with someone, we truly their time with us, that they will game.
So, playing together with the legames of the cooperation.
The result that we really have more robust social relationships.
I love.
You know, there's one reason for the World of Warcraft player in the World of Warcraft play 22 hours.
It's why we know, as we are playing, that we actually are happier working soon, rather than relaxing or losing time.
We know that we are optimized, as humans to work something that has meaning.
And the abitual players are willing to work soon -- if it has a trade.
Finally, a meaning.
The abitual players adorange to be associated with wonderful mission, to human stories on the planetary.
For example, an information to help create a context.
You know all Wikipedia, the greatest wiki Wikipedia,
The second wiki largest wiki wiki is about 80,000 articles are the wiki of Warcraft Cin' people use it every month.
They have more information on the World of Warcraft in the Internet, that on any other argument in any other wiki wiki.
They're building an epick.
They are building a source of Warcraft.
OK, these are the four superpowers that together together constituting one thing.
The abitual players are individuals of great super-power.
These are people who believe that they are individually capable to change the world.
The only problem is they believe that they are capable of changes but not real.
This is the problem I'm trying to solve.
There is an economic named Edward Castrona.
Her studies are brilliant. It's just studiing the reason that people invest so much time, energy and money in the online.
He said, "We are looking at what constitutes nothing less than an exode mass and online."
And it's an economy, so it's rational, and he says, -- I am not like me, I am a joke project.
But he says that this is a perfect thing that this is a perfectly sense, because abitual players can get more in the world's online than in the real life.
They can have more solid in a game that not in real life.
They have a better feedback and feel more rewarded in a game that not in real life.
So, in the real world for now, it's perfectly reasonable for actors, spending more time in the virtual world in the real world of virtual world that this is reasonable for now but not -- in any way, a situation for now but not -- in any ideal situation, we need to start making the real world more similar to a game.
Here is an inspiration from something that happened 2,500 years ago.
These are given antiches, facts of the peaking of a joysticks and cleaning wonderful, wonderful wonderful, we had hair. And they represent the first tools from humanity.
If you know the writers of the ancient Greek, Erodoon, perhaps you know this story.
It's the story of the people invented and why.
And it turns out that the games in particular, particularly the games of did, were invented in the Lidia, during one period.
So that caresty was so severe, that the Lide of the Lidia decided to do something impended.
People suffering, the population was in revoltly, it was a revolution.
So, second Erodoon, invented games and they had a validged law a valida for all of the rule.
One day, everyone would eat.
The next day everyone would be played.
And they diving so deeply in the games of too, from the moment that playing is so involved, and they diving us in a state of game, that ignored the fact that they ignored the fact that they have nothing to eat.
And so one day they did, and one day they eat.
And secondly, they spent so 18 years old, surviving the carestia eating one day and playing that following.
I think this is exactly the way we use games at the day.
We use games to get the suffering.
We use games to move away from everything that doesn't work in our real environment, from everything that doesn't work in our real environmental environment, and we get what we need from games.
But we don't need to stop here.
This is just interesting: Secondly, after 18 years after 18 years, the caresty was not going to improve, so the decise that they would play a last game.
They gave the whole gives in the middle of it, they played a dy; and the winner winers of that participate at a little adventure.
The Lidia and they went to search for a new land where you live, leave you behind the number of people to survive with the resources available to survive their civilization from some other hand, where it could come from.
It's a little bizard, right?
But Recently in the DNA have revealed that the Epusks that they would then brought the same DNA of the Lidia.
And so scientists have suggested that history suggested that history was a real story.
And geologists have found out of a cooling global cooling that almost 20 years and that could explain the caresty.
So this incredible story, it could be true. It could be true. They could be rescued their own culture in games for 18 years and then to be so inspired and know how to come up with the game to the point to save so much civilization.
Okay, we can do it.
I call to World of Warcraft from 1994.
It was the first strategy in real time of the World of Warcraft. This 16 years ago.
They played it for 18 years, we played in Warcraft for 16. We played in Warcraft for 16.
I say, we are ready for our epic game.
They would have half of the population in a new world.
This is where the idea of 21 billion hours of play a week.
Let's do it that half of us agree to go to play a day to play a day to play a day to play, until we solve the real world.
Istitute what you're asking, "How do we solve the real world problems in a game. Well, this is what I dedicated my work during the last last few years, I took the Istitute for the Futur.
In our Palo offices. We have this stending that express our idea of how we should relate with the future.
We don't want to try to predict the future.
What we want to do is -- the future.
We want to figure out from the best results and then we want to take the chance to transform them actually concret.
We want to imagine victories for epic to then give people the tools to make them.
I'm going to show you a very short three games that I realized and I'm an attempt to give people the tools to create victors in their future.
This is "Midd."
We did this game in 2007.
It's a online in which you try to survive an oil.
The charge is not real, but we published enough material honline to believe that it is, and to make real life life as if we were in the game. So, when you enter into the game, records in the game, and domindies that are in the game, and dopodies that show exactly the oil, the things that are not available, the things that are not available, the things that are available impact on the food,
The impact on the transportation, if there are clockets if there are revolved, and you have to think about how you liver your life if this was real. Topodiches to ask you to have a blog about it, to publishing video, to publish --
We had this game with 1,700 players in 200700 players in 2007, and we looked at them from then for three years, and what I can tell you is that it's a transform.
Nobody wants to change the way they live only because it's a good thing for the world or because it's a good thing for the world or because that's where to do that.
But if you dive them in an adventure and says, "We don't have more oil.
This is an amazing story. This is an amazing story.
You're just going to see how you survived."
Most of our players got the habits that has learned in the game.
So, for the next games to save the world, we decided to measure the world, we decided to measure higher, a biggest problem of oil.
We did a game called Superstruct, at the Istitute for the Futuro, and the premise was a supercomputed that humanity has only another 23 years on this planet.
The supercomputing was called "Sistema of Allerta Estination.
We asked people to reach wonline almost like a Jerry Bruckheimer's.
You're familiar with Jerry Bruckheimer, forming a team from the dream. There is the astronauty, scientist, the galeot, and they all have something to do to save the world, but in our game, but in our game, but in our game, the future of resources -- everyone does the future of the energy, the future of resources and the future of resources of health, the future of healthy, the future of security.
8,000 people have played for eight weeks, they've generated 500 generated solutions that you can find if you go online and try to Google "Superstruct."
And finally, the last game, the last game, it will start the three of the marze. This is a game Istitute of the World Bank.
If you completed the game of the Istitute from the Istitute of the Bank, like 2010.
Laving with university shooted for sub-Saharan Africaa, we're inviting them to learn the social techniques.
There's a comic story of comics, it increases through local ability, collaboration, sustainability and collaboration, sustainability and invented.
I want to invite all of you to share this game with young people, wherever in the world, particularly in the developing areas of the developing benefit from one to the developing benefit from one to the world to save the world to save the world.
It's now to end up.
I want to ask a question.
What do you think is going to happen?
We all have these incredible players, we have these games that are the pilot of projects that we could do it, but no one of these has saved the real world.
Well, I hope that you will agree with me that the abitual players are a human resource that we can use to do work in the real world that games are a powerful platform for change, that we have these incredible superpounds, a joy productivity, a joyful productivity, the ability to be a social trama, the capacity of meaning.
I really hope that we can come up with playing games that have important, to survive on this planet to survive on this planet for another century, and my hope is that you joined to me in and participate to games like this.
When I look at at the next decade, of two things are so so that we can make any future, and that we can imagine whatever we want, and we can play anything.
So, I say, we start to games that will change the world.
Thank you.
For a few time I've been interested in the placebo, it may seem something that a magic that a magician if you don't consider from my point of view of that is not to be considered at the point to become something that is failed to become something real." In other words, the way, the words of sugar. In other words, the effect, just because the person thinks the person thinks the person thinks about it, just because the person thinks the person thinks
that what is happening is had to a drug or something like --
The pain of pain, for instance, if you believe that they have a measurable effect.
Something about it becomes something true for perception that if it ha.
I want to show you a magic rodimental, very simple.
And I'm going to show you how it works. This is a trick that is present in all of the books for children in the '50.
I learned it from only Cub Scout Magic in the years.
I'm going to pick it up for you and so I'm going to explain it.
And so I'm going to explain why I'm going to tell you.
Here's what happens.
The colcholer; you can examined; my hand, that you can examinated.
I'm just going to leave the knife in my clean;
I go to my hand.
To be safe or wave from my hand.
Now I weight my wall.
And so you can see that you can ever go on.
And the purpose of this is simple.
I go to open my hand, and if it was all all right, my southern magnetism.
Actually, remains so save that I can school, and the narrow.
Nothing goes on or down from my hand.
There's no trical. You can examinate anything else.
Ta-day!
This is a trick, which often often often is to babies.
that they are interested in the magic because you can learn a lot about English this trick, even though metodologists is very simple.
Many of you in this room knowing this trick.
This is what happens to Tengo into my hand.
I say I'm saving my wrist.
to make sure that nothing hand or coming from my man, this is a good thing.
The reason I'm holding is because it's because that's because that's the secret of illusion.
In the moment my hand is moving away away from you, this dit here, my indically, you move away from where I was in a position where it was so Bello!
There's somebody who's not had an childhood here.
It's like here, right.
And when I walk around me.
We can talk about why it's English, because you don't notice that there are only three fingers down because the mind, and the way that you don't mate, two, three. Three.
But that's not the point. Right? And when I open my hand, Of course, remaintaining not through the magnetism, but through their own indict.
And when I clock my finger, this movement, this movement, this movement covers the dit that come back.
Let my hand.
It's a trick that you can do with your friends and near. Thank you.
Now, what has to do with the placebow?
I read one studio, one year ago, a year ago that I brought me the mind.
I'm not a doctor or a researcher, where it was an amazing thing.
It seems that if you give a placebo in the shape of a white pill, made like an aspill, just a white pill, just a white pill, it has a measurable.
But if you change the shape and you give placebo, under the shape of a smaller, and blue color and blue color, blue color, and you printed a letter is visible.
Even though no one of the drug has a drug pills.
But a white pill, it's not actually as a blue.
You know?
But anyway, it's not here that you end up.
The capsule are more effective than any forms.
A capsule capsule, which is the yellow from one and red on the other is better than a white capsule.
The dosage has a role.
A pill, two times a day is not so effectively as three pills -- I don't remember the statistics.
But the thing is,
that these dosages have a role.
And the shape has a role.
And if you want the definitive placebond you have to use a needle.
Right? A syringe with something -- a couple of hundred of something inert.
you start it in a patient --
This is an image so strong in their mind, much stronger than the white pill.
This is real, this graphs -- I'm going to show you another time when we're going to have some slides.
The point is that the white pill, it's not as effective as that blue of the blue -- it's not as a doctor.
And no one of these has a drug quality.
It's just your belief that makes them in your copro and the effect.
I wanted to see if I could take this idea and apply it at a magic trical.
And to do something that is a final trick.
And we know from the study that when you want a effect you have to use the needle.
This is a seven chicken chicken.
The sterilip a little bit.
This is my carne. This is not Damian of Damian.
This is my skin. This is not a special effect.
I'm going to hole my skin and make this skin.
If you try to nausea -- if you get easy -- I did it for some friends in the tree, the other night, and for some that I didn't know -- and a woman is almost seven.
So if you try to be easy, I suggest that you don't look for the next 30s -- actually, you know, I'm going to do the first part of here -- you know, I'll do the first part of here.
You could see, you can look at another side.
This is what happens here, the beginning of my cardle at the bottom of my arm on the bottom.
Sorry. I'm impressing you?
And now a little bit through my skin, and out of the other hand, like that.
Now, we're in the same position that we were with the knife.
More or not, but you can't count my finger, right?
So I'm showing up here. Here's one, two three, four, five, five.
I know what people when they see this.
Three of them, "I'm not going to be so stupid by hole just to make a few minutes."
So, let me leave you leave a buck.
How do you seed? Abast.
Yes, I know that "OK, I'm not going to see "OK, I don't have seen it good."
People in the rooms are entrance.
Let me show it from neighborhood.
This is really my skin. It's not a special effect of Hollywood.
This is my carne, and I can turn it around.
Sorry, if you hear it from another side, not watching it.
People in the bottom or that will be going to say, "B, it's clear to some effect, but if it was true --
You can see a hole here and a hole here, if it was the blood."
Well, I'm going to get a little blood for you.
This is here.
I normally now levers the needle.
I can see that there are no arm, and I would show you that there are no stops.
But I think in this context, and with the idea of getting something truth, and I turn it into something true, I would leave it in something really, I should go from the stage.
We're going to see a lot of times in the next days I hope you don't see the time. Thank you very much.
So, in my life I met a lot of fish.
I just loved two.
The first one was a passionate story.
It was a beautiful fish weird, carnoous, consistent one of the most vending on menu.
Which weight.
What's even better than it was from a training standards of environmental sustainability.
So, you feel like the consciousness in selling it.
I was involved in a relationship with this beauty for different months.
And one day, the head of the company called me and asked me to talk to a dedicated event to a dedicated event to sustainability of the environmental sustainability.
"Yeah."
This was a company that was trying to resolve what has became an unimaginable problem for our chefs.
How do we continue to have the fish in our menu?
During over the last 50 years we've taken in the marks in the same way we have raso on the forests.
The destroyed was tremendous.
90 percent of the big fish -- the people that like so much the tuns, the halikes, the halikes, the fish are reduced by dramatically reducts of number.
There's no remainly swimming.
So it turns out to us or less water, the water, the weight, the weight, will be part of our future.
There are lots of argument.
The fish heavy heavy, for least the greatest part of it, and they are inefficiently.
A big problem is that there is that there is a 15 conversation rate.
That means that it takes 15 books of wild fish to get a book.
It's not very sustainable.
And it's not a big thing.
So here is there there was a company that was trying to do it in the right way.
I wanted to help them.
The first day of the event I reached to the audience of the company.
Camolar Don.
"Woman," I said, "long to understand you are famous to get so far in the waiting so far, in the open sea that doesn't inat."
"Eitt," he said, "We're so far away from the coast that our shoes are diluits, not focused it."
And then you add a world to particularly a world to particular."
"The conversation? 2.5 to on."
"The best in the sector."
2.5 to one, fantastic.
"2.5 to one thing? What do you are you to eat fish?"
"Proteam.
"Grande," I did. And I got the telephone.
The night, I was at bed, I thought, what the hell is a sustainable protein sustainable?
So the next day later, short before the event, I called Don.
I said, "Doon, do you make some examples of sustainable proteins.
He said he didn't know it, and he would have asked him.
Well, I talked to a few people of the company.
Finally, until I talked to the biology.
We also call him Don.
"Don," I said, "Do you do some examples of sustainable protein sustainable proteins?
Well he mentioned some of the heavy of fish and then he said, "People of the chicken."
I said, "Cood?"
He said, "Yes, skin, pelles, sweat, sat and sat and processed to eat."
I said, "Which percentage your eat me is made of chicken?"
I thought, you know, two percent.
"Well, that's about 30 percent."
I said, "What's the one of sustainable in giving you the chicken?"
There was a long pause, and then he said, "There are just too many chickens on the world."
I told me about this fish.
No, not because they're one of the virtuosis of the good food.
Well, I mean, the truth.
No, I actually told me about this fish because, I'll go after that after the conversation, the fish knew about chicken.
The second fish is a different love story.
It's a romantic history that kind of story that you know the fish and more you know.
You eat it for the first time in a restaurant in the Spain.
My journalistic friend had talked about the fish of this fish.
It basically had us met it.
He went to the table color, he had a brilliant white color, almost scintilling.
The chef was cotten too much.
It basically had to be cotted.
It was still deliptious.
Who is able to make a fish so good after you get it after the stream?
I'm no, but this guy yes.
Miguel.
It's actually called Miguel.
No, she had no cotten the fish, and it's not a chef.
For the less, not in the sense that we intense alone.
This is a biologist in Veta Palma that is a fish of fish in the groundary corner of the Spain the Western Western the War.
And at the '80s was managed by the 1980s.
They were boven on what first was essentially a stage.
They were given the earth building a serious series of channel, so the water in the river.
Well, they couldn't make it work.
And from ecologic view, was a disaster.
He killed something like 90 percent of the birds, considering the place, it's a lot of birds.
So, in 1982, a company with an environmental company.
What do you do?
They reverse the flow of water.
And thirdly, inverse the whole ruttor.
Instead of consuming the water from the grounding, they used the channel.
They teach all canals.
They created a 27 mile wallevening from 27 mile mile diggs and in this process, Miguel and Miguel and this process, Miguel company.
It's incredible.
I mean, you never saw something like this.
Look at the horizon that it seems to be far a million miles and everything that you see are the unlike canals.
I was there very little time ago with Miguel.
It's an amazing three quarters Charles Darwin and a quarter Crocodile Dundes.
Okay? We were doing it in the middle and I anxiety -- I had the kneeded the knee. I had the knee.
First indicates a white rare.
Then he explains the minerals of the fitoplankton then you see a type of fish bunch of the Tanzania.
It turns out that Miguel has spending great part of his career at at Mikume in Africa.
I asked him how he became an expert of fish.
He said, "Pestop? I don't know anything.
I'm an expert in relationship."
And the sounds after he still stuck on the rares, algae and algaes water.
Don't get me very fascinated, this was very fascinating, that is, that is the natural community.
It's interesting, but I was in love in love.
And my head was continuing to rethink that delighty fish fish that I had eaten the previous evening.
So I got him and I said, "Miguel, what makes you your fish so good?"
He indicated algae.
"I know, also, I know, algaes, the fitoplankton, the relationships.
But your fish what they eat it?
What's your conversation?
Well, I'm telling me how their is a wealthy that the fish is going to eat exactly what they would send in a wild environment.
The biomass of plants, the fitoplankton, is the whole zooplancton, is all that feeds fish.
The system is so in the healthy that it's completely.
There are no eat.
Have you ever heard about an enlievent that it doesn't give to his animal?
Miguel later, I was driving around the ground with Miguel and I said, "In a place like this that seems so different from any evening that you have ever seen, as do you measuring succeed?"
In that time, it was as if the record of a movie had ordered the change of the set.
We had the corner, and we saw a scene between the most incredible thousands of fenicotters and thousands of fenicotters of a rose rose that was lost at all.
"That was the succeed."
"Look at their pange.
They are banking."
Banchecking? I was completely confused.
Dissi: "Miguel, but are they not banchecking with your fis?"
"Yes."
"We lose about 20 percent of the fish and the eggs of fishing birds.
Last year on this property there were 600,000 birds over 250 species.
It has become the biggest and one of the most important private health private for the birds in all the Europe."
Dissi: "Miguel, but a releaving population is not the last thing that you want to be in a fish of fish?"
He would have the head of it.
He said, "We try to extensive way I don't mean that I mean.
This is an ecologic network.
The fenicotters eat eating of the legbers.
The range are eating phitoplankton.
So much more is rose the bread of fenicotters that the system."
Okay, so we reassume that doesn't give to eat to eat to his animals and that measure its success in his predators of his predators.
A heaving of fish, but also a bird healthcare for birds.
Ah, by the way, those phenicotters don't even have to be.
They do the nest in a 150 miles where the conditions of the soil conditions.
Every morning, they fly for 150 miles and every night, they do another 150 miles a miles for the back.
They do it because they are able to follow the white line of the A92.
On it seriously.
I thought something like Miguels so I looked at Miguel.
And I said, ""Miguel, fly for 150 miles to the evening and then fly 150 miles of night for you?
They do it for their little ones?"
I looked like I had just quoted a song of Whitney Houston.
He said, "No, they do it because the food."
I didn't tell you about the skin of my loved load that was delighted, and I usually don't like the skin fish.
I don't like embrity; I don't like the rock.
It's that knowing acre, as you asphalt.
Not cooking.
And yet, when I hired it in the southern of the Spain of the Spain of the Spain.
He had a sweet and clean was like giving a dead to the ocean.
And I said to Miguel, and I would.
He said, "The skin is like a city.
It's the last defense that whatever you enter in the fish.
It has evolved to hurity."
And then he said, "But our water has no impurity."
Okay.
A leaving that measures the success of his predators.
And then I realizing that when he says that the halling has not minimization very the way because the water that flows into that fluid is from the River Guadalquir that is a river that it leads with all the things that flume to get today, contaminers tend to bring today, contaminants today, contaminants of pesticides.
And when it flows along the way the water is more than when it's entrane.
The system is so healthy, that clean water.
So, not just a training that doesn't feeds its animals not just a training that measures his predaters but a lead to his predatory of the water and not just for those fish and not only for those fish and not only for those fish and not only for those fish and not only for those fish and for you.
Because when the water, it goes in Atlantic water.
It's a drop in the ocean, I know but I know the wealth, and so you would have to do that because this story of love, because this story of love.
You could say that it's a recipe for the future of the food is that you talk about fish bovins.
So what we need is a radically new conception of agriculture in which the food has a very good knowledge.
But for many people, this is a little too radical.
We are not really passionate about food.
We are friends.
We love the marketing little farmers.
I love little familiar.
We talk about local food.
I love biologist.
And when you say that these are the things that will make sure the future of the good food's future of the good food, somebody els and says, "Hey, even to me accions, but how do you can feeds the red world.
How do you think I can feed the world?"
Can I be syn?
It's a question that I don't like that.
No, not because we produce already have more than enough calories to be able to feed the world.
A billion people suffer the fame today.
A billion -- the most of how many people have ever been -- because of the enormous amount of die in distribution.
You see, I don't like this question because it was determined the logic of our system for the last 50 years.
To look at the pesticks to the monoculture, chemicals, chemicals to the fish terrain fish and all this time the fish industry, and all this time, the agricultural industry just ask, "If we can feed more people in the economic way that we would do that?"
This was the motivation.
It was the justify.
It was the bunch of American agriculture.
We should call it for what it is, a liquid industry in a liquid industry that is fast ecological capital that makes the same amount of possible.
This is not agriculture.
Our panies today is not because of the forners in decreasing but for the resources of resources not for the last mechanics, but not for the last mechanics, but for the ground, not motors, but for the fresh water, but for the rainforests and not to fish, but for the rainforests in the several fish and the nets, but for the fish in the sea.
Do you want to feed?
Let's start ask, how are we going to feed ourselves?
Or better, how can we create the conditions that conditions that conditions to feed itself?
To do that, we don't look at the agricultural model.
This is an old model.
It's all about capital, chemistry and cars, and it has never really produced nothing good to eat.
We look at the ecologic model.
This is what matters on two billion years of experience.
We look at Miguel as Miguel as Miguel at Miguel at Miguel and farm that are not only producers.
If I really have to be the best of them to be chef than I have.
You know, it's going to be good, because if that will be the future of the good food, will be delighted.
Thank you.
I grew up with an injunk diet.
I have to take a school, I have to take a school, an hour and back every day.
And I was always diving in a book, a book of phantant, which was brought to my mind in other money, and sativity, in narrative form, that unknowable sense of curiosity that I had.
And that curiosity was also in the fact that whenever I was in school that whenever I was out in school in the woods of samples, or snakes, or snakes, nipping them at the microscope, I was looking at at the microscope.
I was a real geek of science.
But it always was trying to figure out the world, understand the limits of the possible.
And my love. And my love, it actually seemed to reflect the world around me, because what was happening in the late '60s -- we were going on on the moon, we were going on on the moon, we were going on on the moon, Jacques Couau was in our walls with his fantastic documentary that showed us animals and places that we would not even image.
So, everything seemed to be giving my passion for the phenomenon.
And I was an artist.
I knew drawing.
And because there were no video games in my mindsaturation of movie generated films in the average, I had to create these pictures in my head.
From children, when we read a book, we all had to go through the description of the author, put something on the screen of our head.
And so, my answer was painting was painting creatures, alienes, aliens, robots, all this stuff.
At the mathematics lessons I was always stuck at behind the book.
This is why creativity had to find a way that you have to find a way in some way.
And this happened a very interesting thing about this: Jacques Cousteau programs very engaged for the fact that there was a alien world.
I would not go to a alien world on an alien world on a space.
It was very unlikely to be very unlikely.
But that was a world where I could go to really, right here on the ground, right here on the Earth, the richer and exotic of what I could have read these books.
So, I decided I would become a 15-year-old.
And the only problem was that I was living in a little country of the Canada, at 600 miles from the closer to the close close.
But I didn't leave to go up.
I put together my dad until he found a immersion school in Buffalo, New York, just passed the confine where we live in.
And so I got to take the certified in a bunch of YMCA in the winter in Buffalo, New York.
And I wouldn't have seen the ocean, for two years until we spent in California.
From then, in the last 40 years, I spent about 3,000 of the underwater, and 500 of these hours in the submergies.
And I learned that the depth of the ocean, even deep oceans, even the oceans of life that really are in the way of our imagination.
The imagination of nature is without boundaried to our human imagination.
Again, I'm intimate from what I see when I do the dives.
And my love history with the ocean history continue, stronger than never state.
But when I choose a career, I picked up a career, I picked film.
And it seemed to be the best way to concile this smany, to tell stories with the smania to create pictures.
And as a boy, I would draw constantly comic and so on.
So it was the only way to put together pictures and stories.
Everything came back.
And of course the stories I pick up telling was a phantom stories of "Earth" and "The Abys" and "The Abys."
And with "The Abys" I joined my love for depth and the diving with a film.
So, I make the two passions.
From Abys" came out of something interesting that was to solve a specific narrative problem in that film, which is to create that kind of liquid water creature.
And so it was born the first character to the dead and animated to the computers that had ever seen in a movie.
And even if the movie didn't have a lot of money, I would say to malachievement, I've been testimony of something extraordinary, all the audience was ipated from this magia.
You know, it's Arthur Clarke law for that every technology is very advanced in the magia.
They were seeing something magic --
And this was excited to me.
And I thought, "Fantastic, this is something that has to be adopted in the Chinographic art art.
So, with "Thinator 2," my movie movies, we went very far.
Lavoring with the Industrial Light and Magic, we created the methal metal in that movie.
And it worked. And we have a new piga.
And we got the same result with an audience.
But we gained a little bit more with that movie.
So, by making a line between these two points of experience, I've come to the conclusion that this would have been a whole new world of creativity for the movie artists.
And I put a company with Stan Winston, my friend Stan Winston, who was the main Stan Winston, who was the main truch and designers in that period, and we called Digital Domain.
And the principle of the society was to leave the past, the analogic processes and so on. And so on, and you go directly to the digital production.
And so we did and gave us a competitive advantage for a while.
But we were behind the mid-'90s in the part of the design of creatures and characters, which is what we had the society.
So, I wrote this text called "Daar" with the intension of the visual effects of the visual effects of the visual effects and realistic realistic characterists, and realistic realistic characters and realistic realistic world at the computer.
And the whole thing was given to the mythy.
The kids of the society told me that we wouldn't be able to do it for a bit.
So, I have accanted it, and I did this movie of a big ship.
And I study I throw it like a "Romeo and Juliit on a ship."
It would have been a story of epica, a passionate story.
Segretly, what I wanted to do was to do was to see the back of the "Titanic."
That's why I made that film.
And it's true. The studio didn't know it.
But I convinced them. I said, "We're going to dive back to the back of the living.
We will use it for the beginning of the movie.
It's going to be very important. It's going to be a great marketing ganut.
And I convinced them to fund a expedition.
It seems crazy. But this brings us back to the imagination that creates the reality.
Because we really created a reality and six months later, I found on a submersible Russian and a half of deep in the North Atlantic of North, to look at the true Titanic from an obunch -- not in a movie, not in a film, not in a high-definition.
I stays stop.
And it took a lot of preparation, we had to build Chinepredent and a lot of other things.
But I was remained by those dives, it was like a space.
Where everything was highly technical, and they were require enormous planning.
You put in this hair, you go down in this hairly environment, where there aren't hoping to be saved, that you can't go back behind it.
And I thought, "Fantastic. It's like to live in a phantom film.
It's really great."
And therefore I was affected by the deep of the deep ocean.
Of course, curiosity, the scientific components.
It was it. It was everything.
It was curiosity. It was imagination.
And it was an experience that Hollywood didn't have to offer it.
Of course, I could imagine a creature and create a visual effect. But I couldn't imagine what I would see out of the oblame.
In our next speections I have seen creatures with hydrothermal creatures and times, sometimes, things I had never seen before, things that nobody had ever seen before, that actually wasn't even described by the time we saw and imagined.
So I was all from this and I had to do more.
So I took a curious decision.
After the success of "Titanic," I said, "OK, I put away from my work of Hollywood, Hollywood, and I do the explorer for a little bit.
So, we started to planning these expeditions.
We found ourselves to Bismark and exploring it with tized.
We went back to the back of Titanic.
We took little robots that we had created with the optical fiber.
And the idea was to go inside and make a smart inside of the ship, which had never been done.
No one had ever been watched in the inside of the inner of doing it, so we created the technology to do it.
So here I are here on the bridge of Titanic, sitting in a submergible, looking at the assumption that seemed to be like this, where I knew that they played the violinists.
And I'm driving a little vehicle through the corridge,
When I say, I'm driving, but my mind is in the vehicle.
I think it seemed to be physically present within the back of the Titanic.
And it was the most surrecent experience that I've ever lived -- because I had before, because before you turn the angle I knew what it would have been for, before the lights of the vehicle, because I had the reveals, because I had the revehicle for months around the film.
And the set was based on a repleasure of the model of the ship.
So it was an absolutely extraordinary.
And it really made me realizing that in the experience of the telepresence that you can experiment that you can experiment with these laws, the mind is injected in this other form of existence.
It was very profound.
And it may be a small above what could happen in some decade when we start to start having cybags for explorations or explorations or some other kinds of post-human futures that I can imagine, from a lover.
So, we did these expeditions, and we actually start to appreciate what there was there like in the ocean open of the depth of the ocean.
And basically, they're aliens right here on the Earth.
They live in a chemosynthesis.
They don't surviving in a system based on the sunlight, how we do.
So, you see animals that live nearly in the water at 500 degrees.
It seems even impossible to be impossible to exist.
At the same time I was interested in space, again, a lot of time to the space, again, is the flu.
And I ended up in space environment, really engaged with NASA, sitting in the board of NASASA, planning missions, go to Russia, go to Russia, go to Russia, go to Russia, and all these things to fly at the international space, with all these things to fly to fly the international spacecraft with our 3D.
It was fascinating.
But what I finished to do is to bring the space scientists with us in the able,
And bring them down because they could have access -- astrobiologists -- astrobiologists, people interested in these extreme environments, bring them down and allow them down and allow them to see, take samples, testing tools and so on.
So, we were walking from documentars, but we actually made the science, the space.
I closely closed the narrow of the phanteboy, to do those things for true.
And you know, during this way, I learned a lot.
I learned a lot about science. But I also learned a lot about leadership.
Everybody think that a recorder should be a leader, the chapter of the ship, or something like that.
I didn't know anything about leadership before I had to do all of those speditions.
Why at some point I had to say, "What am I doing here is it?
Why am I doing that? What are you going for?"
You don't make anything to do all these spectacle.
There is malachieving. There is no famy.
People are thinking about that I went to the "Titanic" and "Didar," and I was walking out of the chicken on some beach.
I did all these films, all these documentary for an audience.
No famy, no glorious, no money. What am I doing?
I'm doing it for the compit in itself, for the challenge -- and the ocean is the biggest challenge that exists, for the bridge of discovery, and the layer that you instaura when a small group of shape a team deep form.
Because we were all with 10-12 people, working together for years.
Sometimes in the sea for 2-three months of file.
And in that legame, you realize that the important thing is the respect that you have for them and that they have for you, when you finished a compit that you can't explain to no another.
And when you work on the earth and you said, "We had to do this, and the fiber eith, and the careful, and that all technology, and the whole technology, the whole technology, the whole technology, the most human aspects of the perfomance when you work in multiple -- you can't explain it. It's what perhaps they have lived something together and know that they never explain.
Create a bond to create a bond of respect.
When I came back to do my next movie movie that was "You tried to apply the same principle of leadership to be able to respect the same principle the team and changed their respect.
It's really changed the dynamic.
And so here I was still once with a small group, in an inexplored territory to do "He's not before.
Thirreably emotional.
Tremendously engaging.
And we became a family, in four years and a half.
And it changed my own way to make film.
People started saying that I took the organisms from the ocean and I put them on the planet.
For me, it was the essence of the way to do business.
What can we track it?
What are the lessons that we learned about?
I think the first is curiosity.
It's the most powerful thing that we can.
The imagination is a force that can actually manifest a reality.
And the respect of the group is more important than all the people in the world.
Jupites come from me and they say, "Damme some of the boy to do this."
And I say, "Don't limitation."
Other people will do it for you, you don't just do it by yourself.
And you'll be risk."
On NASA has always this sentence: "The errr is not contemplated."
But the mistake has to be an option in art and exploration, because it's how to make a vacuum.
And no important attempt that has been done without risking.
You've got to run these risks.
This is the thought that I want to leave you, which is that in whatever you do, the mistake is an option, but it's a fear option.
If I wanted to understand one of the great idea that it would be the together of the data that we consume is bigger than the sum of its parts, and that instead of thinking about too many information to emerging new relationships so that you can see new relationships so that you can see new train new trains.
This is the statistics of death.
This instrument that use is an experiment.
It's called Pivot, and with Pivot I can pick up one cause of death, let's say the accidents.
And as we see emerging new relationships.
The reason is that there in the central part of the people are more active.
We can do a step back and reorganize the data because of death, we see that circulating diseases and cancers are the greatest cancer, but not for all.
If we go forward and filming for age, let's say under 40, we see that accidents are the cause of deaths that you worry about it.
All the closer to close close to humans.
So you will understand that visualize information and data in this is a little bit like swimming in a graphic information.
And if we can do it with green data because we don't do it with the content.
So here we have the cover of every Sports Illustrated every Sports Illustrated
All over here.
You can go into your rooms and try and try to try to get into your rooms.
You can see a decade a decade.
Or a specific year,
You can isolate one number.
So let's take the athletes that bee in this number, their sports.
I'm a Lance Armstrong, so I click here and I see all of the numbers where I applying Lance Armstrong.
Now, if I want to give us a look at all of the cycling all the cycles?"
I do a step back and I get the visual.
And now I see Greg Lemond.
I mean, you will understand that when you navigate between information in this kind of closer or far away from a closer or far, it's not only a research, it's not only a research, it's not just browser.
But do something to read something different.
It's a half that second that will change how we can use information.
We still deep this idea that it can seem a little crazy.
We took any single page of Wikipedia and we reduced it to a short reduced a short that consists in a small left-synthetic area.
I'm just going to show you just the first 500 of the most visited on Wikipedia.
Even in this limitation screen we can do a lot.
You understand how tematic areas are the most visited on Wikipedia.
Again, the government point.
We see this option we see that the Wikipedia categories of Wikipedia are the "Person" of the Anno" of Time Magazine.
This is significant because it's emerging something that in the Wikipedia is not there.
And you see it just by making a step behind the together.
If I take one of these resources I can then zoomate on the "Person" from the Time Magazine.
and see them.
Again, I see most of the most of the government from the world of the world in the world of the business.
This is my body.
One is from the music.
And rather interesting, they also have a TED.
So we're going to see all the winning of my TED.
The first time we're really navigating in the network as if it was a network, not from page to a higher level.
I want to show you another thing that could surprise you.
This is the New York Times.
Pivot, this application -- I don't call it browser, because it's not a browser, but it's not a browser, we add this technology for zoom at every webpage, like this.
I can do a step back and I can come back to a specific selection. This is important because the only to see the pages web pages so I can see my navigation in the Internet.
I can zoom on what I did in specific moments.
So here you see the state of the demo that I just presented.
I can somewhat I've seen in a sense of other things I've seen in day.
If I want to do a step back and see everything I can do with pieces my history or historic of my research.
And I was trying to neither the Bing, I tried the Bing, here for Live Labs Pivot.
And from here I can zoom on my page Web and just releasing from here.
A metaphor reused many times, and in every case the result of the parts.
Today, in the world are seen as a sort of a kind of sick.
It's about the overwhelming of information.
It's about analysis on the data.
And if we put it all underneath if we put the web subject instead of going from one thing to go from one thing to the other, we would be able to go from many other things to the structures that otherwise will re?
And then instead of being trapped in the data we can actually extract information.
Instead of doing it just about information, we can pull out of knowledge.
And from knowledge of knowledge.
And with this thank you.
Those are all talking about happiness.
I asked to count the number of books, the word "happinity" in the title and published in the last five years, they have reached to a 40, and there was a lot of more.
There's an enormous wave of happiness, between researchers.
There is very coaching in happiness.
Everybody wants to make people happy.
But despite all of this flow of work, there are a series of "cognitive" that somehow make it impossible to elaborate ideas to happiness.
My talk about today is going to be about these cognitive traps, "cognitive."
And it's about people who think about their happiness, and it's about their own happiness, because they do happiness, because it turns out that we are confused, because we are confused.
The first of these trails is the reluttance to admit complexity.
It turns out that the word happiness is no longer a word as we apply to too many camps.
I think that you can get to a particular meaning, particularly, but in the massive line, but in the massive line of the massive vision of what is the most complicated vision of what is the "well."
The second trails is the confusion between experience and memoria: basically is to choose between being happy in life and being happy of your life and being happy about your life or happy about their lives.
And these are two different concepts of the concept of happiness.
And the third is the illusion of the focus is the illusion that we can't think of any circumstance that we can't think of any circumstance.
I mean, it's a cognitive traps.
and there's no way to do the right thing.
I'd like to start with an example of one person which, after a session of questions and answers, after my lesson, telling a story.
It doesn't clearly -- Disse that while listening a synthetic music at the end of the recording of the record; you felt a terribly strike.
And then he would add it very excited about the experience.
But it wasn't true.
What was broadly the reminding of the experience.
He had lived the experience.
And she had heard for 20 minutes of the wonderful music.
But that I didn't know that because he remained with a certain remind; the remind; the memory was everything that remained it.
What this episode tells us is, in the bottom, is that we could think about ourselves and other people in terms of two themselves.
There is a discover of the experiences, that lives in the present and knows the present, and it's able to revive the past, but that basically has the present.
This is that it is that lives the experiences and what the doctor is coming up -- you know when the doctor ask -- you when I touch her, when I touch here?
And then there is that it remainly remember, this is that it reminds the dots of the history of our life, and it's the story of the history of our life and is that the doctor to ask: "How are you heard in the last them?"
or whatever it was your journey in Albania?"
Those are two different entities of different entities, the thing that if you remember, and what if you remember, and the two is part of the confusion of happiness.
The theme is that remember, it's a dinner.
And this process begins with a fundamental response of our memorial response -- it immediately.
We don't only tell stories when we decide to tell them.
Our memory tells us stories, oxyety of our experiences is a story.
Let me start with an example.
This is an old studio.
Which leads to the experience of two patients during a painful procedure.
I'm not going to flip in details. It's not very painful in today, but it was painful when this study was conducted in the '90s.
You asked the patients to get their pain every 60 seconds.
And here's the results for two patients.
Those are their result.
If you ask you Chho she's suffering.
It's a very simple question.
Carely, Patient B has suffered.
his colonic colony wise, and for every minute of pain from the patient A's patient BB has suffered at least as A or more.
But now there is another question: "How about these patients think they are suffering?"
and here's the surprise: The Patient was the Patient of the Blady of the most of the Patient of the B.
The colonic stories of colons, they were different given that one part of the procedure of the procedure is the way -- no one of these stories is particularly positive -- but one of the two is particularly the worst of the other.
And the worst is that where the pain was the final time.
It's a negative story.
How do you know?
Because we asked these people after the colonpia, and even at the time, and even at the time, there’s been the experience, all of considered?"
and a lot of much worse to A long worse for B, I remember.
So this is a conflict between the effort is that lives the experiences and the theme is that remember.
From the view of it is that lives the experience, is clear that B has been suffered most of it.
So, what you could do for the patient A, and we actually have clinical experiments, and it was really done, and it could extract the colony of the Patient A maintails without moving.
This is going to have a little bit of pain in in the patient, but just a little bit less than before.
And by doing this for a couple of minutes -- the thing that lives the Patient experience, will be worse, and the theme of the Patient of the Patient will be very better, because now the Patile Patient has a better remember.
How do you call a story?
And this is true for the stories that are from the memories that we invent what we call a story, are the changes of meaning and final.
The final are very, very important, and in this case, the final has dominated.
So, the sand that lives the experience lives lives his life in a continue.
Do you have a moments where you live experienced and question: What happens to these moments?
And the answer is simple.
They are performed to say that most of the moments of our life -- for how I calculated them -- I mean the psychological present is about three seconds of the second about three seconds that means in a life, we count about 600 millions. In one month, if we count about 600,000 the most of which they don't leave it out.
Most of them are completely ignored by the side.
And yet in some way, you have the feeling that what happens in these moments of experience is our life.
It's the limited resources that we're spending as we are in this world.
And how to spend it, it seems to be relevant, but it's not the story that reminds for us.
So we have a bunch that reminds and a theme that live experiences that are fun enough,
The biggest difference between the two is how to treat the time.
From the view of the sand that lives the experiences, if you go in vacation and the second week is fun as much as the first one, then the vacation of a week.
But this is not the way that it works.
The sand that is that remember, one vacation of a two-week vages because there are no new memories.
You didn't change the story.
And in this way, the time is the critical variable, the critical variable, the idea that it reminds from the theme that lives the experiences.
The time has an limited impact on this story.
Well, the idea that it reminds the experiences is more than remembering and tell stories.
It's actually the thing that makes decision-because, if we look at a patient that has gotten, for example, two different doctors and is deciding which one of the two different doctors -- what he thinks about the two different doctors is what the doctor, and that will be the least "negative."
The thing is that lives the experience has no voice in these choices.
In fact, we don't choose between experiences, but among the memories of those experiences.
And even when we think about our future, we don't think about our future.
We think about the future as a memories.
So you can take this situation, like a tyranny, like a tyranny, and you can think of the theme that you can think about as if it flies the experiences through the experiences of the qualizes that lives the experiences, doesn't need it.
I have the feeling that when we go to the vacation is often the case that you get in vacation in good at the service of our mind is that remember.
And this is a little hard to justify.
Now, how much do we consume our memories?
This is one of the explanations that is given for the predomination.
When I think about that, I get a vacation in the Antarctican Antarctica, a few years ago, which is one of the best vacation of my life, and I think relatively relatively about other vacuances.
And I probably spent to think about that trip of that trip of three weeks to say, 25 minutes in the last four years.
If I ever opened the billboard with the 600 photographs of the journey, I would turn it into another three weeks of the journey that you translates an hour and a half an hour and a half an hour and a half.
Well, I could be a little bit later, I could be a little bit in my shoe consumption, but even if you made more more than that, one question.
Why do we take a lot of weight respect at the fish that we have experience?
I want you to think about an experiment with thinking.
Imagine that during the next vacation that at the end of the vacation of the vacation of all the pictures will be destroyed, and that you take a medicine for the amnesthesia so you won't remember nothing.
Would you wake the same vacuance? And if you could choose a vacation between the two is and you have to think about how to solve a conflict and you have to think about how to solve it and actually not so obvious, because if you think in terms of time you have a answer.
And if you think in terms of remember, you could get another answer.
Because we choose the vacation that we do, is a problem that puts us in front of them.
The two are brings of happiness.
There are actually two concepts of happiness that we can use, one for every themselves.
So you can ask. How much is it does the experience?
And then you can ask, how happy are the moments in life of the switch that lives the experience?
And it's about -- happiness for moment.
What are emotions that we can measure it?
And by the way, we are now able to make us a good idea of the sand that experiences over time.
If you ask about happiness is that remember, it's a completely different thing.
It's not how happy.
It's about how it satisssy or comfortable is the person when she thinks about his life.
It's a very different idea.
Anyone is not able to distinguishing these two notions, it will not be able to create confusions in happiness, and I look at a bunch of student well-being, and I brought a bunch of happiness for a long time in this way.
The difference between happiness is that lives the experiences and the satisfaction of the shere that reminds has been recognized in the last years, and there are now to measure the two separately, the Gallup has an institute to measure the two separately, institute of their life and on their experiences.
And there were other studies in this direction.
So in the last few years, we started to learn about happiness.
And the biggest lesson that we learned is that they're very different.
You could know how a person is satissssy with your own life, and still this doesn't tell you much how happinly I'm living your liver and neighborhood.
To give you an idea of the correlation is about 0.5.
What does it mean if you meet somebody and you say, "oh, his father is 1.80 month" as you know of her alteen?
Well, you would know something about his height, but with a lot of uncertainty.
You'd always have a little bit of uncertainty.
If I tell you that somebody thinks his life is at eight in a scale from one to 10 10 you will be very uncertainly uncertainly uncertainly about how happy they are with their own experiences.
So the correlation is low.
We have a certain knowledge of what you control satisfaction.
We know that money is very important, the goals are very important.
We know that being happy is to be satisssssatisfacfacfacts of time with the people that full us.
There are some pleasure, but these are the mains.
So if you want to massize happiness of the two, you will end up very different things.
The conclusion of what I said is that we should not think about happiness as a substitute of well-being.
It's two completely different ideas.
In the more, very quickly, another reason why we can't think about happiness is that we're not paying attention to the same things when we think about life, and when we live life.
So if you do the simple question about how happy it is how happy people in California, you can't get the correct response.
When you ask this question, you should be happier in California, that in Ohio.
What happens is that when you think about life in California, you're thinking about the contradiction of California and other places, for example, that comparison is about climate.
Well, it turns out that the climate is not so important for the session for the lives that lives the experiences and it's not very important for the reflects that is what happy is going to decide how happy.
But because it is that reflects is in charge, you could end -- some pottery, you could finally -- some pottery people in California.
And it's interesting to true what will happen to happen to people who transfer in California, in the hope of being happily happy.
Well, the issue is that lives the experiences is not going to become happy.
We know it.
But something going to happen. They think of being happier, because when they think they are going to remember how terrible it was time in the Ohio.
And they will think they're going to take the right decision.
It's very hard to think clearly about well-being and I think I gave you the idea of how hard it is.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: Thank you. I have a question for Lei.
Thank you very much.
When we were at the phone a couple of weeks ago, he mentioned me that a interesting result that a result of the Gallup.
Is it something that thinks that we still have a few minutes?
Daniel Kahennan: Yeah.
I think the most interesting result we found in the Gallup in the Gallup is a number, that we didn't expect.
We found that, with reference to happiness of the effort.
When we looked at how the feelings feeling with income, we discovered that at a 60,000 dollars a year of 60,000 dollars a year, for Americans, on a study conducted campon a very vast conduction of about 600,000 Americans, it's about 600,000 Americans, it's about a representative of 600,000 dollars a nose --
CA: 60,000 DK: 60,000 thousand dollars a year, people are infelic, and they become stronger progressively stronger than the poor Al above than that, we find a line.
I mean, I actually saw the lines of the lines so it was plated.
Clearly, what happens is that the money doesn't buy happiness happiness of the experience, but the lack of money. And we can measure that misery, and we can measure that misery misery that misery misery that misery miseria,
In terms of the other thing is, is that remember, it's all another story.
More money gans, more content you know.
This talk is not going to be on emotions.
CA: But Danny, all the efforts of Americans are about life, freedom, the pursuit of happiness.
If people get seriously this discovery, basically you have this discovery, basically you get all the things that we have created, for instance, the politics and so on.
Is it the chance that politicians and the nation in general, can they take a discovery as that seriously, and bring a public political political political political politic?
DK: You know that I think you recognize the role of happiness in public politics.
The press of consideration will be slowly in the United States is not doubt, but in the U.K., it's becoming reality, and in other people.
People are starting to recognize that they should think about happiness when they think about public politics.
You will put a little bit and people will start to talk about if you want to study the experience of happiness or if they want to study the valutation of life that we need to start this debate.
As you think of happiness, it takes different directions to how you think about how you think about them, and you think about the theme of the things that you think about the experiences.
All this influence is the political, I think, in the 190s.
In the United States, they are making efforts to measure the experience of the population.
And this, I think, will come in part of the next decade, maybe two of the national statistics.
CA: Well, it seems to me that this argument will be there, or for less it should be, the most interesting political discussion to follow in the next years.
Thank you very much for the behavioral economy.
Thank you Danny Kahnemeks
I'm going to talk about energy.
It may seem strange, seen that in my work at my work at the vaccines and seeds, things to invent and give the world to help the world the world for helping two billion poor better lives.
But the climate and the energy, actually, are extremely important for this people, are most important for them that people, are more important for them that for everyone else in the world.
A worse means, for many years, loss.
It's going to get too much please.
The things will change in ways that their fragile can just not replacement.
Which leads to famy.
So the climate camps, so they're going to be awful.
Even the cost of energy is, for them, important.
In fact, if you could leave the price of one thing, to reduce poverty, you would choose poverty, you would choose poverty, you would choose very long energy.
The price of energy.
And a progreded civilization of progression of energy progress.
The carbon revolution.
And even in the 19th century we have a quick decline in the price of electricity, the explain why we have refrigerators, conditioners, we can create modern and do so many things.
So in the rich world is about electricity in an excellent situation.
But as the price scenes, for example of the half, we have to respect a new wine, the windle of CO2.
The CO2 is scaling the planet, and its equation is very simple.
CO2 emit causes a increase of temperature, which induces very negative.
I was on the climate, perhaps even worse effect, in the sense that natural ecosystems can't go to these rapid changes and then collapse.
The valuation of how much car temperature is because of a CO2, and like each of the two worst things the other, is uncertainly, but not a lot.
And there is certainly uncertainty about how denial negative, but they will be extremely negative.
But I often asked the best scientists -- we have we really need to reduce emission?
We can't just reduce half or a quart?
And the answer is that, until we get to zero, the temperature will continue.
It's a great challenge.
It's not like I say, "Let's go through a high-3.5 truck.
It's not about "absend it a little bit.
It's about a zero.
Now, we put a lot of CO2 every year, over 26 billion tons.
About 20 tons for every American.
For the poor countries, it's less than a tons bony.
The mondial average is about five tons.
And somehow, we have to make progress that bringing that amount of a zero.
Cemissions are constantly increased.
Only some economic changes have changed this tendency, so we have to go from increasing rapidly to zero.
This equation has four factors.
It's a series of multiplies.
We have the amount of the left, the CO2, which must be broaded, and the factors on the right are the population, the services that in every average, the average, the average, the average request from each of the service and CO2 emitition.
We are looking at each factor and we see how we can get it.
Probably, one of these numbers must be able to get it in almost zero.
It's a wisdom.
We see a little bit.
The first factor is population.
The world has now 6.8 billion people.
We go to the nine billion.
If we do a good job with new vaccines, health reproductive health, we can decrease it perhaps one of the 10, 15 percent, 15 percent, but here we record a increase of about 30 percent.
The second factor is services that we use it.
The understanding of all, the food that we eat the clothe, the TV, the TV.
They are wishing, and free poverty is to provide these services for nearly all over the world.
And it's a positive thing that this number increases.
In the rich world in the rich, we probably could save and use men, but in average, every year, this will be saliry.
And therefore, complex, the amount of services are going to be more than doubling.
This is a very simple example.
You have the illumination in your house to make the company, but these guys, so they come out and read their bests.
How much of the efficiency -- the energy for service unit of service -- there are good news.
This factor is not increasing.
Thank you very different inventions, new ways of enlightening, automotive construction can be differently, for a lot of services you can decrease considerate energy.
In some services you can reduce 90 percent.
There are other serving services, like fertilizers, or the aerial transportation where the margins of improvements are very, very nurse.
So, complex, in the best of the cases, the energy consumed in three to maybe six times.
But these first three factors reduce emissions from 26 -- in the best of the cases, maybe 13 billion tons.
It's not enough.
We look at the fourth factor, the far, the amount of CO2 emitition.
The question is, can we reduce zer?
If you burn the coal, no.
If you burn the natural gasases, no.
Not all the ways to produce today the electricity, to part of the renewables and nuclear -- they emit CO2.
So what we're going to have to do is to create a new system.
And we need "miracle."
Which is miracle I don't mean something impossible.
The microprocessor is a miracle.
The Internet, and his services, are a miracle.
People today have participated in the creation of a lot of measure.
We usually don't have a scadence, a given within which to deliver the miracle.
Again, you are at the window and something else.
In this case, we need to drive to all fast, and make a miracle in a very remarkable time
I said, how do you illustrate this concept?
Is there some natural example -- some kind of demonstration that you catch the imagination of gent?
I thought about a year ago, when I brought to the mosquitoes and people found it fun.
They were participate that in the world, there are people who live with mosquitoes.
This is my idea for energy.
I decided that to fly lights would have been this year my contribute to the environment.
Here is the lights.
I think they don't stop, they could not come out of the board.
-- now, we can invent it like this, but they're not help.
We need solutions, one or a lot that they are, that work on the great scale and very religion and very reliable, and although it is exploring in many directions, I think only five of them may surprising effects.
I claim to die -- geotermic fusion, biofusion, biofuels.
They could also have some contribute, and if they can do more than I expect, but I'm interested in that I'm going to have to work on each of these guys, and not reaching to anything, and not reaching to nobody, because all the challenges challenges.
We are looking for the first fuel of fossil fueling fossil fuels.
And here our task looks simple, but not is, and it is, and it's not is, and it's capture the CO2, after combustion, at the camp from the camp to the room, and hoping that it remains, and hope that it remaining it.
There are the experimental technologies that catch 60 -- 80 percent of CO2 percent of CO2, but reaching 100 percent will be very complicated and it's going to be hard to conserving all this CO2.
The most spinful issue is still the long term.
Who's going to stop?
Who will give something that is literally billions of times more voluminous than any other kind of reframeful, like nuclear or else?
It's an enormous volume.
So it's a difficult problem.
Another source would be nuclear one.
But the nuclear is three big problems.
The cost, especially in the very regulated, is high.
The question of security of security, the feeling that nothing can go wrong with the human operators, and that the fuel of combuster is not used to use.
And how do you run the scorial?
It will be able to reduce it, the concerns are so much of it.
People need to be switch.
Three very much problems, so that you could solve and what you should work.
The last three of the bottom of the five sources.
These are often what people often call "renewable."
And to say the true, the great advantage of not to require a combustible comburible,
The first is that density density with these technologies is definitely inferior at that of an electrical power
It's about energy, and so many kilometers of square kilometers, of areas of areas of thousands of times more extending than a normal electrical electric electrics.
And also these sources are intermitted.
The sun is not all the day -- not all of the days, and even the wind wind soundaries.
So, if you depends on these sources, you have to find an electrical energy even when the source doesn't make any electrical energy even when the source doesn't produce.
Grosses challenges us on the costs.
And on the distribution.
For instance, let's say this source is outside.
So not only you need technology, but you also have to do the boundaries with the outside.
And finally, the problem of accumulating it.
To estimate the size of the problem, I analyzed all sorts of bacteria in the car, computer, telephones, any type of them -- I compared with the amount of electrical energy.
So we need a big step forward, a 100 times than the approach.
This is not impossible, but it isn't very simple.
This problem is already when the sources of intermitting when the source sources, we say, 20 or 30 percent of the energy consuming energy.
If you take it to those sources for 100 percent, you need a miracle.
But how are we going on on this road? What is the right approach?
Is it a Manhattan? What could we solve the problem?
Many company, a hundred company, they need to work.
We need at at least hundred people in each of these five sectors.
Most of them, observing them, you would call it crazy.
And I think here, in the group of TED, many people are already working in these camps.
Bill Gross has several company, by which an eSolar, which a great technologies in the sun technologies.
Vinod Khosla is investing in dozens of companies that are doing great things and they have interesting, and I'm giving my support to all this.
Nathan Myhrvold and I are finding an company, following you will follow and the road of the nuclear way.
There were some innovations in branch the nuclear module, the nuclear nuclear nuclear liquid.
But from a good time, the sector is stop, that there are some good ideas around not so amazing.
The idea of Three is that, instead of burning just part of the uranium, U235, the one percent of the uranio available, we decided to burn U238, 99 percent of the urban idea, in a sense.
The truth is about it for a long time, but it never had been adequately tried if it would work or not, because of modern supercomputers today, you can do a simulation and see that yes, with the right materials, it seems to work.
And because it gives the 99 percent of the uranium, the structure of the urban costs.
They burn the scories, and they use as a combuster of the reactors of the reactors of today, that they become the problem that they become a exploitable resource.
This is the uranio as the combustation. It's a kind of chandela.
It's like a bond that burns.
From the view of the fuel is solved.
This is a picture of a place in Kentucky.
This is the show, 99 percent of the uranium, which was toldly now used as a combusty, and so it is called uranupon urban impoor.
Those are going to be energy in the United States to the United States.
And by filing the sea water, with a economic process, there would be enough for the rest of life of this planet.
So, a lot of challenges us -- but this is an example of the hundreds of ideas that we need to make progression of ideas that we need to make progression for progression --
How should we measure our progres?
What would they have to have the pagellies?
And then we provide the goal and then we value of the intermedia.
You've heard a lot of people talk about an 80 percent reduction for 2050, it's really important to get it.
20 percent will be produced by the poor and some of agriculture.
At that point, you hope -- we'll have solved the deforestation and the production.
To get to 80 percent, so the developed countries, including nations, including nations like China, will have to replace their electrical production.
The other question is, are we making this technology emission?
Can we practice in nation?
Are we spread?
It's an important aspect.
It's a key element.
Again, what would expect should have the pay of 20?
Even that should have the same two ways.
We should be implementing of efficiency to start getting reducing reductions.
As we empainting will be the total amount of CO2, and so the temperature.
But the vote in this material, do things that they don't really do large reductions, has only part, or along, the other, which is the speed of innovation of new inventions.
We need to push these progress, and we can measure the speed from the number of companies, designs -- modifies of regulations.
Many very good books have been written about this.
The Al Gore, "The Gore, "The choice, and that David McKay, "Sustainable Energy Without the Hot Air."
And these books approaching the problem and create a context in which I want to do the debate because these things need to have a substantial.
Most things have to have to be contemporary for.
So I have a wish,
A very concrete desire that we invent the technology needle.
If I had to choose one desire for the next 50 years, translate the president of the country, the president of a vaccine, which is a vaccine, which is not CO2.
It would be with the greatest impact.
If this wish, you won't make the sentence between thinking about short-term of the United States and the United States and China, between the United States and China, between those two billions of those two billion people will be much worse.
What do we have to do, right?
What am I inviting you take the initiative and proceder?
We need a greater support.
When nations reunate in places like Copenhagen, they should not have to talk about CO2.
They should talk about the innovation program, and you would stupid of how much short we invent in these innovative approaches.
We need incentive in the CO2, the chap and traded, instruments that evidence of the pollution.
We have to spread the message.
We have to make this more rational dialogue, and it must include the choices of the government.
It's a commitative wish, but I think realizable.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: Thank you.
Thank you. Just to know more on Earth's Earth.
first of all, can you give us an idea of the scale of investment?
Bill Gates: Realize the software, to buy the supercomputer, assuming all great scientists, what we've been done, it requires only tens of millions, and even when we tested the materials in a reactor, to be safe to be sure that they work to dover, we're only going to talk about hundreds of millions.
The hard thing is to build the plug reactor, find a number of billions, the place in which will be built the first example.
Once I built the spring, if it works, it will be the eggo of Colombo, because the density density of energy, they're completely different from the nuclear that we know today.
CA: So, if I understand, this implementug the construction of a vertical serbatoio filled with nuclear fuel fuel.
Then the process starts from the high and progregression to the bottom?
BG: Right. The reactors, today, are reformed, many people, many controls that can not work, open and so many people can not work.
Not good!
If the fuel is very inexpensive is very economic and you can spend 60 years and forgoats in and forgotten all those complexity.
He brings up there, burning for sex sex, and then you end up.
CA: A nuclear plant for itself.
BG: Yeah. Well we can leave them, then you can put them in another reactor, put them in another reactor and burn them.
And we're going to start with the existing rewarding, now conserved by cooling or the container of the container or container in the container to the reactors.
They're going to be our first combusty.
So what was a problem of conventional reactors is going to be the fuel of the name, and the volume of the reflight will be reduced.
CA: But when I speak around the world of the potential of this technologies, where most interest in the world of rescued to his realization?
BG: Well, there's no place in particular, and there are all these interesting rules of transparency of everything that is called nuclear rescure.
Our staff was in Russia, India, China.
I just met the Energia.
We talked about how this idea comes to the current at program.
They're optimistic. France, Japanese and Japanese made of work in this field.
It's a variation about something that has already been done.
This is a reactor but it's a kind of reactor but it's a kind of reactor, so many countries have already built a speed reactor.
CA: Again, what are the time and the probability that something of the kind of do you do that?
BG: Well, for one of these projects scale -- producing energy, that doesn't cost, much energy, we talk about 20 years to design it and 20 years to design it.
This is the scadence that the environmental models.
Thirree if all of the way, that doesn't ask is a little bit of a very easy deal with this goal.
And now, fortunately, dozens of companies in the sector, that analogy, if their research works, if the function of their plants.
And it's better if many solutions will have succeed, because at that points will be able to reminate a set of solutions.
We need to have at least one success.
CA: Again, this is the largest you revolutionary, this is the biggest you know?
BG: A revolution is the most important.
It would be even without the environmental wine, but the environmental wines, but the environmental wines make it much more important.
There are other innovators.
We don't know their job like this, but one is the modulare; a different approach.
There is a liquid reactor at me. It seems hard to do it, but perhaps they say the same thing.
So, there are funny fun, but the good is that a molecules of urania, a million times more energy than a molecules of a molecule -- we say, coal, if you can run the negative aspects of the potential, in terms of the environmental war, in terms of the environment, and it makes it a classroom and other.
CA: And if it works, what do we do?
Wouldn't we be able to get emergency to try to send the Earth's temperature to keep the Earth?
BG: If you find you in that situation, it's a little bit like when you eat too much, and you are to have a heart attack.
Where do you go to that point? You could need a surgeon or something like this.
There is all the research line, in geoengineering, that are various techniques that are various techniques that they would slow us 20 or 30 years in which to coordinate the action.
It's like to clear a polystage polish.
I hope you don't need it.
Some of them say that you should not even work in the polize, because you can stop, you're going to keep eating because the surgeon.
I don't think it's a choice, the importance of the problem, but now in the geoengineering of the geoengineering, you ask if you want to take the solutions in the case where the event event -- or innovations come later.
CA: Clima-skeptically, if I had a phrase, as you could persuaderle persuaderons that they have tortow?
BG: Well, unfortunately, there are different kinds of skeptical skeptics are very few scientific skeptics.
Some people say there's a negative feedback because of clouds from the clouds of the clouds of warming.
There are very, very few things that you can only tell us that there is one probability on a million that you will have a million that you have the main problem looks like AIDS.
You put a mistake now and you pay the consequences only later.
And therefore when you're taken out of a thousand emergings, the idea to make sacrifices that you can just see the results of --
I sacrifice junce.
In fact, the relationship of the IPC doesn't make the word; there are people in the rich; there are people in the rich world that looks at IPC and says, "OK, it's not the bad.
The fact is that that uncertainty should get us to action.
But my dream is that, if we can make it economically, and to respect the wins on the CO2, then the skeptical skeptical skeptics, I don't care about CO2, almost I would like an emittate because it's more economic technologies.
CA: You're going to be this response to the Bjorn Lomborg, that if you invent all the energy and try to solve the CO2, your other goals, your other goals, your goals, will be sacrificated, will you be sacrificated?
BG: Well, the effect in research and developing --
We say that U.S.A should spend 10 billion in more than they do now is not so ingal.
It shouldn't be destinate resource resources.
The things that behaviors are very much money, and they also have people reasoning, are funded to have anti-economic solutions.
For me it's overwhelming that.
Unless you are finding the curve of learning the curve of learning at the point where it will become very economic efforts are focused in technologies that have focused in technological technologies that have the potential to absence the costs.
If the alternative, "We make the expensive energy, so that only the rich can afford," all of the present can afford the power five times as much of life.
The disaster would be for those two billion.
And Lombor: Lomborg has reviewed his positions.
His now "Why don't you talk about Rember more than Research and Sviluppo?"
For his past again collects between the "skeptical," but I understood that is a bunch bunch of the Ricer's and Switch.
And it's a question that I think it's appropriate.
It's incredible how little investing you investigate in research and development.
CA: Well Bill, I think just about the most of the audience by saying that I hope to see your desire to become reality. Thank you.
BG: Thank you.
I want to share with you one discovered I made a few months ago when I was writing an article for Italiana Wireview Wired.
I always have my own dictionary about my hand every time I write something, but I had already finished the article and I realized that I haven't ever in my life tried the word "disable" to see what I was going to find.
Let me read the result.
"Disable," age: damamamaged, adjustical, indifenious, rated, consumed by stop, stop, stop, died Indebold, died, consumed, consumed by the circulation, died, consumed by the circulation, splple.
Contrari: In form, strongly enough.
I was reading this high-voice list at a friend and at the begins to reed, it was so ridiculous, but I had the word mutiled my voice, and I had to stop, and I had to stop, and the impact that the upper shock and the impact that the top of these words have left me.
You know, we're talking about one of my old dictionary.
I'm thinking, it's going to be an old away.
But, since the early 80s.
when I was starting in school, and I was forming and learning what there was out of my family and learning what there was my family and the world around me.
And I was useful, thank God I wasn't using using the dictionary.
I mean, from this explanation seems that I was born in a world that sees like one that has nothing positive in any way for them, when they are celebrate today, they are celebrated for the opportunities and the adventure that my life has approached.
So, I'm immediately going to see about 2009 in the back of the 2009, waiting me to find a revision without value.
This is the update version.
Unfortunately, it's not very better.
I find the last two words under "contrary." And in particularly uncomfortable and "health" and "health." So, it's not just about the words.
is what we think when we meant with these words.
is about the values behind these words, and how we build these values.
Our language influence our thinking and our vision of the world and how we see other people.
In fact, most powerful civilizations, including that Great and that Romana, they believed that offer was more powerful, because it was more powerful.
So, what do we actually want to exist, one person who is limited, or an force?
So, casually doing something simple as to nominate a person, a child, we could put the taps and throw on their strength.
Would we don't like to open pores for them?
One person who opened me the doctors, was the doctor of where I was the Dupton, Dupont in Wilmington, Delaware.
His name is Dr. Pizzle.
Italy, the U.S. which, which was too difficult to be able to take for most of the Americans, so it has become Dr. P.
And the doctors had always fears papillon colored and had a perfect clink to work with children.
I was basically anything about the time that I spent in the hospital, with the exception of physicians of physicist.
I had to do what they seem infinite repetitions of exercise with these big elastic fases, in different colors -- you know, to help me build the muscles of legs.
And I hate these elastic elastics.
I hate them, I got sick, really odid.
And you know, I knew already about, like a five years, with the Dr. P to try to get from these exercizes, Inudge, clear.
And one day, one of my seat, Stanananang and inesorables, these sites.
and he said, wow, Aimee, you're a child, I think you're a little girl, I think I would go to break one of those phans.
"When the pull, I'm going to give you 100 dollar."
Now, clearly it was just a little manufactor to make me exercises that I didn't want to do with the perspective of being the richest child in the second plane, what he did did -- it was a different form of a routines to a different form to an horrible routines.
and I turn it into an interesting experience for me.
And I'm asking today, the entity of his vision, and his deployation about me as a girl, she redefined my vision of myself in a stronger and athletic athletics to person the future.
This is an example of how adults.
But, in the example of the vocabulary of the vocabulary of the synones, our language doesn't have the ability to evolve towards the reality of an individual.
Our language, it wasn't in the past of changing our society, many of which have been created by the technology.
And of course, from a doctor, my legs, the operations to leave with their own left-of titanies and also retrouble for the bodies that are helping people to cooperate with their skills, and you move over there of the skills that nature has imposing the implatforming of social networks, allow the people to be able to description of the networkers to identify of social networks.
So, perhaps the technology will be revealing now clear what has always been a truth, that each one has something to rare and afford to our society, and the human ability to adapt is our greatest quality.
The human skill, is something interesting, is something interesting, because people have always wanted to talk about difficulty of trouble, and I have to love it.
This sentence has never gone, and I always felt in the response to people about this -- and I think I'm starting to understand why.
is underneath this sentence in this sentence, insorty, is the idea that the success, or happiness, is the idea that succeed or happiness, is reemerging from a challenge of this experience, if my life in life has come from an ability to a life that it is to skill, or what the present people as my disability as my disability.
However, we have changed, we were marcats, logically, from a challenge, physically or mentally both of them.
And I would suggest that it's a good thing.
The advertise is not an obstacle that we need to get to start our life.
is part of our life.
And I get to think it's like my shadow.
From a lot of time -- and sometimes nearly for nothing, but it's always with me.
And, of course, I'm not trying to decrease the impact, the weight of a person.
There are adversities, and the challenges in life, and it's true and relative to every single person, but the question is not if you had to deal with it.
So, our responsibility is not just to protect people to us from the adversity, but to prepare them in the right way.
And we do a damage to our children when we feel that they're not ready to adapt.
There is an important important difference between the objective medical action of being an printed and the subjective opinion of the society that will see me or not.
And in fact, the only disability consistent that I had to deal with is if the world has ever thought I could be described by those words.
In our wishing desire to protect those that we love by giving them a free truty truth on their prognoysis, really, the prognoysis of their life expectancy of their life expectancy, we have to not put the first morning.
Maybe the existing model of looking only at what there is roof in and how to put it in the place, it can address more the subject that disease itself.
Not one person in the complete, not to understand his potentiality, we are creating another disease in the natural suffering.
We are actually giving a vote to the value of one person in our community.
So we have to see through disease and human capacity.
and, much more importantly, there is a relationship between those insufficide and our great creativity.
So, it's not to proposition, or negative, or denies, these numbers as something that we want to avoid or find under the tiles, but rather to find those opportunities to rack in an accident.
So, perhaps the idea that I want to explain is that there is no thing that we can get an adversity, as you open it, to use a term of free, perhaps even by using a term of free, maybe even giving us together.
And perhaps if we look at an accident like a natural thing and useful, we are less overwhelmed by his presence.
This year we celebrate the two-birthday of Charles Darwin, and it was 150 years ago, when I writing about evolution, that Darwin has illustrated, I think, the truth of the human character.
To tell it in another way, it's not the most strong of the speech that survives, and it's not even the smart, is that the more you adapted to change.
The conflict is the genes:
Darwin, between other things, we can recognize that the human ability to survive and development is driven by the human spirit of the spirit human spirit through conflicts in transformation.
So, again, transformation, adapting, is our greatest quality.
And perhaps finally, we don't know what we are doed.
Maybe this is what it gives us. A sense of possess, a sense of its force.
So we can do a gift here.
We can re-imagined adversity as something more than the harder.
We may see it as a change.
The adversity is a change where we haven't still adapted.
I think the biggest adversity that we have created is this idea of normal. Now, who is normal. Now, who is normal?
There is no normal, there's a type. There is a typical.
And would you want to meet those very gray people if there be?
I don't think about it.
If we changed this paradigm from one on how to get the normality to one on the possibility, or potential, we can understand the so many children, we can understand the so many kids, and inviting them to joining their preptious capacities with community.
The anthropologists teach us that what we we, as humans, we always wanted for the members of our community is to help, that they can contribute.
There is an evidence that in the Oland, 60 years ago, they brought the old and the subjects with gravity; perhaps thank you from the experience and survival of these people was the value of the community of the community of the community; they were seen this people like round and value.
A few years ago, I was in a city market where I grew up in the north of Pennsylvania.
and I was stuck in front of a little bit of a pound.
And I had extended and I had pants.
I heard this guy, his voice behind myself, it's not Aimee Mullins" and Mullins." And I wrote -- and there is this man of a half.
And I said, "I'm sorry, you know, I am I not remember? I don't remember, I met him." He said, "You don't remember having me.
I mean, when we met when we met you were borrowing out of your mother."
Risate Oh, that guy.
And, of course, in fact, I was playing a camping.
That gentleman was the Dr. Kean, a man that I had only known by the stories of my mother on that day, because of my mother on that day, because of the typically, I got into two weeks.
And so, the knee knee of my mother had gone in vacance, so the man who made me was born an extranecolor for my parents.
And because I was born without the lost and I had the paper, some fingers in this feet, and some in that time, he had to be the messaggere, that I had to deliver the bad news.
I said, "I've had to give this prognote to your parents that you wouldn't walk and you wouldn't walk and that you wouldn't have the kind of mobility that they have other children, or no liver than any living, and I gave me some of life, and you gave me the extraordinary thing that I had the extraordinary articles during all my childhood, an extraordinary ary,
that I had brought with the Girl Scout, you know, Hallowe'd won my studio, which I won my study, or all my sporate lives, and he used them, and he used them to use, and he used them and Hahenmic medicine schools of Hahnemey.
And he called this part of the Grow; the potential of the human volunty of the human volunteer.
No prognosis can tend in account of how pose it can be and determining the quality of life in a person.
And the doctor, Kean went to explain and he said, "Not my experience, unless you repeated, and even though it is gives us a bunch of support, if you just leave to itself, one child came to it."
You see, Dr. Kean changed his opinion.
I understood there's a difference between a medical condition, and what each one can do with it.
And there's been a change in my thinking about the years, in this if you were asked me when I was about 15 years, if I had exchanged prosthesis with the carne rying and boss I wouldn't exitate a second.
I was all that kind of normality at that time.
If you ask it today, I'm not safe.
And it's because of the experiences I had with them, not for the experiences that I had with them.
And the change in me came because I was exposed to the people who opened me the door of the people who opened me.
You see, everything that you need is a person that you need is a person that shows you the epiphania, and you're started. If you can give somebody somebody your kles of their forces, the human spirit is so wealthy, if you can do it, and open a door for someone in a crucial moment, the education of the fundamental ways.
You're teaching them to open the doors.
In fact, the exact meaning of the word educate is from the roots "to exten" that means, to pull the potential.
So again, what is the potential that we want to pull out of it?
There was a study in the '60s in Grand short when they were walking from the schools elementary schools.
This is called "prove in continuity," we call it "ling" here in the United States.
It means to separate students dependently by their you.
And the students with the best voters have a longer program -- and teachers a better teachers -- they did it for a three months, and they did it for one period of insuffering, they were smart. And they said they were bad, that they were smart.
And at the end of this period of three months, they were given the results of the optime." And clearly, clearly, the sad of this studio, and that they took students from "Ot." And this studio, "That's what happened at the end of three months.
The ones that were remained to school, beyond the ones I had leaved.
The crucial part of this study was that the teachers were also trained.
The teachers didn't know that it was done this change.
The state said simple. These are the very good students.
And that's how they started to teach them.
So, I think the real disability is to have a damaged spirit and a damaged spirit doesn't have hope.
You don't see the beauty.
It has no natural, infantile curiosity and our innate capacity.
if we can support the human spirit to maintain hope, to see the beauty of beauty in if you are using our correct and others, to be imaginative and we are using our correctly.
When the spirit has these quality, we can create new realities and new ways of it.
I want to leave you with a poem written by a poet-lost poet-300 Hafiz who gave me my friend Jacques Dembois Dembois Dembo:
and the poem is called the dio that knows only four words and you know, God of God, not the God of NO, not the NO, but the God dio of NO, but the God knows four words and continues to repeat with me.
Thank you.
