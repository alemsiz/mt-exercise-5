The year I showed these slide to demonstrate that the calculates that for almost three million years has had the three million years has had the size of 48 percent.
This is a source of the problem because it doesn't show it because it doesn't show it of the glacight.
The climbed arty is in a sense, the heart of the climate climate system of the climate system of the climate system of the climate system of the climate system of the climate climate system.

That's the ice in invery, which is the windly right.
You can see the cosid-glacior perenne, five years or flies, is like the ske, which is like the sket, which is like the body.
In 25 years is spent from this, like this.
This is a problem because the tough of the lacior glaciated to the ocean arty where there are enormous amount of carbon and food, they are going to get into meters in meters of microbs.

If you look at the context of the context of the follow.
In the last five years we add 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the oceans in every day.
Look at the area of Pacific area of Pacific America, and on the bottom of the continent, where there is a very poor in the ocean.
Most of global warming global deforestation, and deforestation, which is the 20, is using 20, is the usually usually usually use.
The oil is a problem, and the carbon is persy.
The United States are one of the most emissions, together with the Cina.
And they proposed to build a lot of other hrun.
But we're assisting a change or direction.
These are the projects of annothing in the last years, and some of the revers.
As every way, there is a lot of political in our Paese.
The charbon and the oil industry have been expect in the last year to promote the charbon to promote the carbon of charbon and the charge of the charge of the charbon and the charge of the charge of the charbon and the charbon and the charbon and the last year
This image is recovered me something,
I know Natal, in Tennesse, where we live in the Tenness, and a 3.8 billion charge of charb.
Maybe you seen it on the news.
This is the second largest flexies in America.
It was happened in Natal.
The published natalization of a carbon of carbon was this thing.
Vide: I was going to be the charbay is a kind of a and happine.
It's a good here in America, and it makes our economy.
Froy the carbon is always more and more and more and more and more and more and more big.
It's a good price, and the workers and worked and workers are hypen.
Al Gore: Does here is the best Virginia.
The biggest society is Massey of the mountains is Massey Coal.
Vide: Don Blankenship -- Al Gore, Nancy Pelos, Harry Pelogo, they don't know what they are talking about what they are talking about what they are talking about.
Al Gore: So the At for the Proteon of Clim has launched two campaign.
This is a essentially of it.
Video: All ll right. ALer's see the changes like a myself as a myself to our business.
So our priority is investing a great amount of money in a public sforce to make a public and confusing the true of the remarkable of the carbon on the carbon of the carbon of the carbon of the carbon of the carbon of the bon.
In fact, the carbon is not sporal.
We think it's a good -- it has a good properfumy.
So not precupated.
Let me do now.
Video: All right, I can heard -- you heard about a lot of it.
So we do a game in a framework to be about the carbon to the carbon to the carbon to the carbon of the carbon of the charge of the balance.

If you want to go to the way together, you go to this."
We have to go to the fast, quickly.
Thank you very much.
The year to TED phecks on the LHC.
And I promise to reach it on how machine.
So the other four. And for those who don't have the other time -- the LHC is the biggest experiment of the most experiment of conference.
Here's a compiece of rection that were less than a billion of a second of the beginning of the beginning of the second.
All of this is simply of it.
This is the windest Gineve.
We have these mini-Big Big Big Bang Bang Bang Bang Big Bang Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Biig Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Biig Biol.
This is what I work. It's called ATLAS -- is a 444 meters and has a four meters and has a diameter of 22 meters and has a diamet.
This is a picture of ATLAS in ASSAS in building.
The 10 settember of the year we have accesor the first time.
And this photograph was told ATLAS.
It was a lot of immense festors in the health.
It's a picture of the first phascious physical image of the HC, ring in the LHC, and deliberately with a part of LHC, and hondropped the relevel.
In other words, when we see that the picture of the picture 10 settemployees that machine, which is a great life.
I don't know if it was to do it out of the more opening of Google and vide that the pages and vide that beginning was this thing.
What we had a cultural impact of cultural impact in scientific impact.
About a week of a week with the machine, just to have these files here -- these files here -- these files here -- these files here are the files.
These are 13,000 printing when the machine works in the powerful works of powerful powerful powerful as we could be a powerful of powerful when the machine works in the machine works on the machine works in the machine works in the machine works in the powers.
Now, the technical technical film and say, "It's not really really right."
And instead of it because when they are very freedom becomes covered the surfaces of the surfaces.
So, at less 271 degrees, a perature of the space between the stellow between the star of the stellow between the stellow of the stellow between the star of the stellow between the stellow of the star of the space between the stellow space between the star star of the star star star space.
In one of the most of the most of emnovels in the LHC, there was a fabor of fabrication.
So the files that rescale is to read a resister and 13,000 printed and 13,000 printed to a resistance of electric.
This was the resulted.
Now, this is still more impressionate if you think that these magnets are about 30 centimets of 20 centimeters.
They're dannegs about 50 magnets.
We had to be able to lot, what we did we done.
We have repristinated and add just.
These are they are ranging all of their below place to their place in the ground.
Entruth, the end of the LHC will be new integry.
We will accepty to keep the girls or or himself or him, and then our wind to find how our wind to find what are the matter is the matter of the universe.
Now, of course, in a certain the way, these gentless of the science of the science of science and eeria and eeria and evidence of the science and eeria to conconnect.
I think that the fact that it's so difficult to go to the sun, I think is this the value of things like LHC.
I want to share with the words of a scientist, Humphrey Davy, Humphrey Davy, which is a fense of his inus, and the experiments of his hundred was dangael Faray, he said, "No Michael Faraaday, and the human human beings of human minds, that are not the writing of the ideas that our own own own own ideas that our own own own own own own own own own ininness of the new ideas of the windangerouldn't conctly writing of our of the worldition of the worldence,
Thank you.
I want to start asking to ask you to rethink about how to go to the children, play with the characters.
And as you understand how to do them and to make them and further them and mother, learn them and mother, learn and to think and resolve problems and to think and the relationship to the space of space.
The reason is is propertive to the way we understand that we understand the part of the world around us.
So, by informatical informatical information of our interaction with physics, and my consults, and my consult of Pac, and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanith, I started to asked the winformation of the mouse of the mouse as a computer and degital to the winformation that you can actually move a gather, and then the information of the information of the information of the boman, and a charge, with the winformation of the sentence,
and we can get our pleasy?
The question was so interesting that we decided we decided to exploring the answer to the Siftable.
In pocke, a Siftable computer is a great interactive as a birth of a bird as a big brows.
In pocke, a Siftable computer is a great interactive as a birth of a bird as a big brows.
You can move with the hands" between them, they can see the right and they have a slightly and a radio wireless.
But of course, are objects of physics, as the matter can move move to be able to be going to be going to be going to be going to move on on on it.
The Sifty is the example of a new ecosystem of information.
And they become more physics, consciousness, consciousness, and other people, and the mand they become more physics, and they have more than the ways, as we can explorate new and fun and fun new standing new and fun and fun new stily and fun to interaction.
I'm going to start with some simple example.
This is the Sifty is configured to show video -- if you including a direction, if you including the other hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand.
These are interactive interactive of the others.
If they are interesting them in what they were interested in what they intor.
If they are the circumps and they can get a po.
If they are the circumps and they can get a po.
They also also also their motion, and inclination.
We realize that one of the interesting of the interaction was the power of the interview of the interest in the sune of the sune as a book.
In this case, we have three Siftconfigured like secks of the color, and I can use them to be in the central in the central and I can use them in the central of the color.
and I can use them to be able to the color, where they mix clear, where they mix they mix clear.
If we can actually get too much of it, we can reput a little bit of place.
These are also beautiful of appears like the language, as as the languages where people can try to try to try to try to try to try to make things that are going to be the results.
Now I'm --
This is a Fibonact of Fibonact with a equations.
So we have a game of words that is meters between Scarabeo and Boggle.
Prically, to every turn in the militerle, Proratic, Pratically, Pratically, Pratically, a letter or on every brother, and as a letter or on the Siftable, and as a rectable, and as a detection.
Then, after about 30 second-second-records a new set of lects, and new characters of trying to do.
Thank you.
Here's the children came in the Lab, I did it in Lab, I did it and I did a video.
They are placid molecure.
And one of the things interesting things about this kind of application is that not to give you a lot of instruments.
You know, "Would you have to do it -- and they were going to do.
Here's some people who tried it.
This is our best head of younger than the younger of game.
It was actually just implants.
They just were only mattons, for him.
Now, this is an interactive application of a interactive.
We wanted to build a tool of the English language Luui is Felix.
It can inserve new characters in the scene, and they were associated with Siftable their associates.
It can inserve new characters in the scene, and they were associated with Siftable their associates.
And that's doing it using the sun.
Vide: The sun.
David Merrill: On a he's hand.
Vide: The treatment arancie.
Bel work!
So I can get the Siftable and put it out of the nears can interact --
Vide: Bau!
and it inventing their stories.
Vide: Cao!
DM: It's a story with engine, and it can decide how you feel the same.
DM: It's a story with engine, and it can decide how you feel the same.
Video: Voly, you know,
DM: The last example I have the time to show you is a tool, realized and exeside and exeside of music.
It's a tool, realized recently to five and exeguy and exeguy music.
The Siftable here is a basic basic and the battery.
Every different of these has four variations, and you can choose what you use to use to use what us.
You can inserve these sounds in a comport from a comport of the food.
And modifiardle to be a touch of his so."
These are actually that you can control from live and the film and the film.
And what they were to take a particular and then include to be able to add it.
And then there are the general effects like time and flight to intersequence.
Look at how it works.
Video: D: We can try to put a base in two Sifty in two Sift," we start in a serious sequence, we add the other bas.
Now in a bunch line.
Video: D: One of the percent of the percents --
Video: D: And I'll put the film to the bacteria, so I can control the effect of the live of the live of the live of the live of the live to the bacteria.
Video: D: I can quite the interinterinterinterinterinterin the time from the time from the other side of the other sket.
Video: D: And now I'm going to add the film to the bottom to the most expression.
Video: D: I can recombinate the sequence of the flight."
So I don't have to planning the first time, but I can try to make it more longer or more longer or more ger or more gart.
And finally, I can see the interinterin the whole sequence of the squency of the squence.
Thank you.
So, as you can see my passion is build new interface more always always like our brain and more more like our brain and body.
And I had time to show you one of the result of this percord of this percord of this percorner that we try to take out of the labor.
The concept that I want to transmit is that is that is that is coming this new generation of the design of digital objects in our world that will be information in our world that we want to do.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the time to talk to all of you.
They're a writish writing.
Scritical books is my profession, but it's more of this is more of course,
It's also the love and the fashcine of my life.
And I don't expect that can change it.
But I said, something that was happened to be succeeed in my life, and my careera, which has takes me to realibring the whole thing with this was to work with this work.
The particularly thing I recently written this book, this biography called "Mangia, Prrry, Prry, and the qual, and it becomes a great dest of the world and becomes a great sense, and becomes a great sense of interaction, best, and a great sensational.
And the result is that everywherever they were like to be as if they were like they were like to food.
Dave, condence, condence, and condence.
They are now all worried and saying, "You don't have to be able to do you can't do it better?
You don't have to keep writing to writing all of life without more power to create somebody can create somebody can make somebody to be able to do you can have somebody to be able to do you can have somebody to be able to write somebody can you have to write somebody can be able to writing somebody can can actually do somebody to write somebody can be able to write somebody can you can actually have somebody to do you can actually have to be able to
that can important somebody to somebody else that you can have somebody else that can we have somebody can we have to somebody can we have to somebody can you have to somebody that can we have to somebody that can you can have somebody els?"
It's rasicall, you know, you know.
But it could go to the worse of the reminds that I remember 20 years ago, when I started to say to the people -- I was a write of the -- I wanted to be a writing.
I met against the same reaction of the bottom of the country.
And people said, "I don't have the time I couldn't have success?
You don't have the billion of the refires of the refires of the ref?
You don't have to do this mestyid to do this mestyself and never get out and myself and myself on a heart of sources with the bouth of lock of the care of the sking?"
So we know it.
The walking -- the short of all these questions is, "Si."
I am country.
I always had to be country.
And I also country, many other things that people could not be to ine.
As the algain and other things of.
But as I was going to writing what I thought and I was asked me and I asked me because I was like?
Is it?
And so that everybody debate to be often to be oftened by a job that you feel that they feel to do.
But what is so particular in the prese creative creative to make it about the health save the salth of the involved in a way that other than you don't have to do you don't have to do it?
How my father, for example, he was a engineer and not recognize if you were going to be able to get the 40 years, which was asked to be engineer if it was asked to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be able to be going to be to be to woul?
And there was never -- that block of the engineer John, how they wis?
It didn't work?
Enestly, the engineers like group like group as they don't have certain in the selight of the reputation of being alcoped in the reputation of the reputation of the reputation of the reputation of the reputation of the reputation of course,
We have a reputation, we have this reputation, and not only writers but creative creative of every generates of all of the generation of being enormous instable.
And not the other thing to look at the tristes of the death of the deates of the magnific creative and often in the windns and often to hand and often to hundreds of gay.
And that doesn't have the sounds that they don't seem to be really, they were made by their woms.
Norman Mailer, before the last view of the interview of my book to my book me a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a remarkable to the work of the work of the work of the work of their life.
But we don't have the way to feel that we heard these things that are so much about the way we have a different way we had a very interiority and the soft that creative creativity and the soft of the soft and soft to the angoes to the angood.
And the question I want to take all of the today, you have to do with this ide?
It goes on this -- because it looks like a himeter of a distance of the hyet that is not good for this supposed to this pox.
I think it's odiose.
And I think it's dangerous and I don't want to see the perpetuated in the next several sector.
I think it's better to incord our great creative creative creative creative creative creative creative creative creative of lives.
And I was really really in my case -- in my home -- it would be very dangerous to be a very dangerous rectype of the rest of the circumstances that are in my careera.
Obbbe, but looks like, I'm very young, I have about 40 years.
I still have about four decade of work in me.
And it's very likely to write what it will be writing from the world as the work that was going to be able to be able to the last book.
I will be skket, because we are all of friends here -- it's probable, that my biggest is to my ball.
Oh, Gese, and you think,
You know, this is the gene of thinking about a person to start to start to begin to be able to get it to the battina and I don't want to do it.
I would talk about this work that we have to do this work that we lot.
So, the question becomes to the question becomes to the question becomes to the question becomes to the question becomes to the question becomes to the question.
And so seemed after a lot of reflections, which the way to keep is to try to keep a psychological copsychological copsychological copsychological copsychological copsychological psychological of reflections, which is to work to keep the way to work to keep the way to work is to create a psychchchological copsychological costruction,
I was in some way to find a distance of me, I am writing, and my natural bunch of me, and my natural is on what it was going to get to get out of the year to be able to look at the time to look at the time to look at the time, trying to look at the time, trying to find other society to see if they could have the more sane and more sane and more sane and more sane and and more sane and more sane and more sane and more sane and more sane and the writing of the way to have to be able to see if if they could could could
how to help people creative people to make inerent inherent inerents of creative creative creative creative creative creative creative creative people.
And that researching to the Grecia and Roma.
Seguitems because it was in certain and then back.
In the ancient Grecia and Rome and Rome -- people don't believe that the creative creative creativity came from many, OK?
It was thinking that creative creative was about the diving and that was seen by a few people who came to be able and food, and they were able to die and fits.
They were called these dives of creativity of creative creativity.
Socrate, wonderful of course, it was to have a charge that was swish saged by the sage.
The Rome was the same idea, but they were called the kind of a kind of spirit without a genie.
The big is great because Roman, because Romans were not a particularly intelligenior intelligenigenie.
They have to be a kind of a kind of divine that created in the murses of the study of a study of a study of a study of a Dobby, and and that came out to the nassister of the work of the work of work of the work of work and model.
Exighborhoods, that is the distance of which is the distance of the psychological and the results of your work.
And they knew that was so that it works, right?
So the artists were protypes were protype of things, like for example too narcis?
If your work was exceptional was exceptional powerful and all the market, all of the market, all of this geniuum that incorpore."
If your work is not the phally, it was not all of your bad?
They all knew that was the ture, the genies of being a inability.
So people have a conceived creative creative creative in Occident for a long time.
And then Rinasciment came and all changed it and all changed this great idea; we put it in the center of the universe of the universe of the grounds and without left space, and without left space, and even more than the creature of the creature that they writing from the divinity.
This was the main of humans and people start thinking about the raational and people start thinking that creative creative and began from ished.
And for the first time in history, you know, it is a kind of a kind of like a piuttoo that is like a plutting with genie.
And I have to dirvely, I think was a big error.
I think about somebody, a simple of creating a very simple of creating as a recipy and the sources of all my own own own own bones and the people and the people and they were indecar and hates a is a responsibility to the fragible or too much of the human fragile of human.
It's like to ask someone of the sun.
Deform and distores of the ego and creates all these expectative expectative on the performance.
And I think it was this pression to have the argues in the past 500 years.
And, if this is true, and I think that is the question.
We can do it different?
Magaary to a more than the relationship of the relationship.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we can't cannot cannot to chang 500 years of a rectal talks about 18 minutes.
And probably people have the audience that solled would be ready to sush the scientific notion of the notion of the name of the needs of their further of their projects.
I don't know you know, I don't know about this thing.
But the question I would like to take is -- because we have -- why we know?
Why don't I think about this way?
Because it has more sense of every other thing I ever heard to explain the process of the creative process.
A process of what I ever have ever tented to do something -- so fundamentally, all of -- yet, you don't understand it -- they don't understand it is not coming uption.
And, it can be completely to be completely paranormal paranormal looks like to be completely paranorm.
I did this instead of the extraordinary poety of the poet, which has been a poet, but it was a poet, which was a little bit of the life and he was a little bit about the Virginia, and I was working out in the walking in the walking out in the walking in the walked from the country.
He said it was like a phone.
And that was coming round to lei the country.
And it goes to get the ground to the ground under the ground of his building.
It was going to have a solve thing to do to that point and he was talking about the point and they said, "corrink."
And so it goes to the house and it was going to be able to be able to take a little bit of a character, and it would be in a freshed and a mathem, as the trained and fast, as the past, and they would go to the page.
Other than three times could be able to be quickly and recorree and recorree and recorres and the recorres and the southern and it would have to get through and it to get through and it to get through the country, and it would continued to row through the country, and and he would keep the other poet."
Then there were the times -- this piece of -- that they were never -- there were never lots of the moments that was almost perdly, they were almost perding, right?
So, he was running to home and he was trying to get it and the poethesy and the poeth, and then he was going to go to the walked with the other hand and then he was like it with the other hand and the offere.
He was the poeded the poem of the hune and the read and the reality and transcities.
And in these half today, it would be on the perfect and intact of the word to the first word to the first word to the first one of the word to the first one of the word of the word to the first word of the perfect of the word of the word and the first word of the perfect of the word of the last part.
So when I heard the thinkingers, it's exactly exactly the process.
I don't have my creative process -- they're not a condition -- they're not a condrute.
They're a muly, and my way to work is to work and I see it in every day, and to go and go to work and go to work and go to work and go to the food.
But even in my head, in my head, I was set against that was against what I was going to be in the time.
And I also image a lot of you have the han han han han han han han han that you can also have a hand.
You know, if the work and ideas and ideas and ideas I wouldn't be able to be able to extly it.
And what this is what this thing?
And how we can relationship to do not do the head, but took the head, mapiles, which we do do you can make it reman?
So I was looking at the best example of the best example of the Tom Waits, which I interviewed in a day.
We were talking about this, and you know, Tom, and you know, Tom, for the major life, and the argument of life, trying to control of control, to try and control these species of a kind of creative kind of creatives to the innation of creative creatic creative extinct of life.
But then instead of that, and a day, and a day, and a day, and he was driving on the Los Angeles, changed it all for him.
It was going to go and fast, and all of this little fram, which is to get it in his head, which is a hundred of a lodiration, and the sun, and the sun, and the wonderful, and the wish of the sun, and wish of the sun.
It has no put, it doesn't have a mathematic, it doesn't have a recorator.
So I started to feel this kind of wind a growing rote in him, and I will remarried by this song and remarried by this song perhaps
I'm not enough enough and I can't do it --
And instead of go into the panic panic panic --
I'm going to be the whole process and fold-new process.
I just just just the choice and said, "Scus, and he said, "Scus, I don't see that I'm dy?
"To seems that can writing a canzon to writing?
If you really want to be back to a more opportunity when I can take current when I can take care of you.
One of course, you know, to the other other today.
You go to disturbing Leonard Cohen."
And his process to work on this was going to change after that.
Not the work, the work was still as a seems.
But the process is that the fishing of the ancient was released when the genie, the genie, the genie, the genies that would be a sent to be a hundred and it was going to be a whole thing that was not to be a whole thing to be a whole thing to be a whole thing and it was a whole thing and back.
but well, it was a very good bbity, wonderful bizar, a conversation between Tom and this thing that was not not Tom and exercial thing that was not Tom.
So as the story that became up to change a little bit about the way I was working and I already and save me a fly time.
This idea, I was writing when I was writing "Mangia, Prule, and he goes in a of those care of the disperation of the disperation that we were working on something and we can start thinking about it and start thinking that is going to be a book, which is going to be the pig.
It's not just good but, the pigggently writing.
And I started thinking about this project.
But then I remember reors that works on the air and try to get us to the air and try and try and try and try and try to get me to the air and try to me to the air and try to remind.
So I was going to do my face in the hands and I direct my face to a tangle of the room.
And I said, "Well, I mean, "I mean, I mean, what this book if this book that if this book not not be brilliant to be brilliant not be but, right?
Because as I see that I'm going to put all all of that.
So if you want to be better to presents and you have to be able and do your parts.
Okay, if you don't know what I don't know about it.
I'm going to write the same because my work.
And I would like to favor that was recorner that I today, I was presented to my te," because I was so so that I was like Okay, the people who were in the people who were going to get to the sack of the people who were going to go to the long of the sacross and walking and walong to the be.
And they were always magnific because the ballers, because the ballers.
But every tantly, something happened to something happen, and one of these arts becomes up in reality becomes to transly.
And I know what I know about what I know you have the view of course, a performance of a performance like that.
And as the time you stop time and the walerin's walerind through a kind of bring and wouldn't do it in a different sun, but it was all of the sun, but all of the night of the sun.
And in suddenly not just like a human.
But you get to the dident, and the below of the divinity of divinity.
And when this happen, I knew people people know what they were in the way, they call it it with his name.
They were going to be able and started to cant, "Aah.A. Aah.A.
That's God, you know.
And I was notice -- when Mororor, the sound of Spagna, and the sune of Spayna, and they were going to change in the sections of "Aah." "Oole, and "Oole, and "Oole," which you can feel in the flash."
In Spage, when a was something impossible and magic -- and a magnize, "Aah, magnific -- a shoe, and a shared -- a chart -- a chart of God.
And it's great because we have to have it.
But the problem is the day to the wind states the ballery and found that are the 11 of Martedy of Martedy and the sket.
It's just a mortal death, and maybe it will never be able to be able to ask that we never have to be able to the treat that thely.
And maybe no one will be the name of Dod still as well, and what do is to do with the rest of his life?
It's difficults.
This is one of the most of the most dolors of a creative life.
But maybe not to be so angood, so scientist, and it doesn't believe it wouldn't believe that the most extraordinary of your being coming to yourself in the same.
But I just believe that they have to be in prested by a foundation of this squist of your life that you have to spend somebody else when you have to spend somebody else when you have to spend somebody else when you have to spend somebody else when you finite the square that you have to spend somebody else when you have to go to be a past when you finished by the
And, you know, if we think about this whole whole change.
And so I started thinking about the way, and it's sure as I was a different months in the book in the book that public book that public book -- and it was prestly fasying, the dangerous of my great deox, and it was going to followed my great deoddddrious to be able to be in my book.
And that I have to continue to demonstrated me when I feel elected by this is, not well, I wouldn't have the country.
It's not to add it.
Continua presents to your own own butter, whatever can be it.
If your work is ball, ball, bally.
If the divine, I mean an to save a few of skilled to be some of a wonderful moment, to just a moment in the wells of your own own shapes, "Ole."
Someefs, you know, the same ture.
And "Ole!"
I think and I think and I debbbe.
"Ole!" to be able to have the samp and head, even to have love and head, and head.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
You know I already about some of these projects on the human, on what can meaning and the discovered of new set of genes.
Now we're starting a new percorporate and the biology of biology and now now we started to degitalizing in a new fashion.
We always set of the big questions.
"What's the lifes?" is something that many biology have telling you to understand how much levels.
We have a different approach, reduced in terms.
We are digitalizing from almost 20 years ago.
When we sequenced the genome of the world was to past from the world of the world of the biology of the computer.
Now we asked to ask the life, or create new life, or create this new digital?
This is the map of a little organism, Mycoplasure of the genitalium, which is the kind of a little between those that can autoreplicated in the laboratory.
And we tried to reduce the genome of create a little bit of smaller and a little bit of smaller.
We are able to eliminate a centination of about 500 of genes of about 500 that are here.
But when we look at his map to his map in metabolic map to the now.
There's simple of that.
But when we look at all the genes that we can elimine, a is very improbable, it's very improbable, that can bring a vidence of the vivent.
So we decided that the only view of progrese was sintetics to progreatest this cromosome.
And so we started the window? We were going to be setic.
It can the chemics to be able to produce these great molecules that we never have been able to create before we have never been able to create before?
And, in case of them, we can make a cromosom to make a cromoso?
A cromosome, it's just a a piece of inerts.
The quickly fast with digitalizing life is growing to the life is growing exponential exponential exponential.
Our capacity of writing the genetic, progress of the genetic, but it's better than hand.
And our results of results, the left of a exponential curve.
We started more than 15 years ago.
The process has requires a lot of puts, began to the revision that beginning the first experiments.
But we found that sintetics of DNA is very difficult.
There are decade of thousands of the world that are producing little segments of DNA lectly 30 to 50 lect and it's a degenerative process of the world is a long erroad, more than than the set is longer than than the same.
So we had to develop a new metom to assembling these framments and recorrects.
And this was our first tentative information of the information of the genome of the genome of Phi 174.
It's a little bit of small virus that killed batters.
We designed the framments, effectured the correction of the errors and kept a lot of DNA of about 5,000 letter.
The interesting part of this is when we took this piece of inert and we have it in the batters and we have begin to read this genetic code of the particles of the viral particles of viral particles of viral chemics.
The virals are are then released by the cells, are background.
I was talking about recent industry of oil industry was saying that they are certainly comprecious that they certainly comprecial model.
They have more than you.
We think this is a situation that the software can actually build its same situation system in a biological system in a biological system that is a gic system that is a girl.
But we wanted to do things more in big things in big things.
We wanted to build the interor cromosome.
These are more than 580 miles of code of genetic code of genetic.
So we thought of building it in cassets of virus, so that we could change the cassets to understand what the cassets are a living cells of a cell physical cells.
The design is crucial crucial information in a computer, these are going to be very accurated.
When we sequency this genome for the first time in 1995 accuratey, the standard-was a error,
We found it resequence, 30 errors. If we were used to use that sequency not be going to be able to do it work.
One of the process is to design set to the 50 lect that you feel that you feel with all other segments of 50 lect to build under 50 lect lect together.
We can be a little bit of a lots of here.
You probably have you read that we inserve in the physical physical phys.
Think of the thing: we have a genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic code and T.
Three those lects together with about 20 friends about 20 friends and there's a specific minutes to every mine of the lectly of the lect of the lect of the gam.
So we can use the genetic code for writers.
What we did we have it in the beginning was autograph.
Some are states from the fact that it was not poethesia.
We designed these segments for a very simply of the uniquely with the entire of the unique.
There are improving them and put them and put them and put them and put them them and put them them out and put them and put them them and put them them and put them and put them them and put them and put them and put them and put them and put them and put them them and put them them and put them them and put them them and put them and put them them them and put them them and put them them out and put them and put them and put them them
And we started to assembling of the particularly beginning to five to five to five to seven the lect of 24 miles of the lectly lect to their half the lect lects.
We have product we product these set of these sequency so that we can actually actually actually actually found that we're going to try to create a proceive in a minute.
We are trying to automatizing the process.
So, this looks like the tabellon a tabellon of a basket.
When we go to these segments very long as a long time of 100 miles of the basis, not growing in in Ecoal.
It was to the limbs of the biology of biology biology of molecular tools.
So we have to be more months.
We knew about another mecker mecker called reparent, which in biology, which in biology, which is used to reparate DNA gram of the universe of the universe of the segments.
Here's a example.
This organism, called Deinococcus radiococs can three million radiation.
You can see in the requarter as his cromosome.
In 12 -- 24 hours is reassembled as was before.
They were thousands of organisms that are in fact,
These organisms can be completely to completely completely slow.
They can live to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to live under it.
They're assumption, and life exists in space and they were to find new environment.
In the trtrue, NASA showed that this was living that this was going to be living
This is a a picture of molecule that we have built using these simply using the design approaching with the design approach.
The book them axed them automatically.
This is not been took with a microscopy electronic microscope of a microscopy microscope of the ske.
It's a very big molecule that we can see the with a microscopy read with a microscopy read it.
These are photographer that they were a seconds.
This is the published that we did a little time ago.
These are more than 58,000 lectly code of genetic.
It's the most of a largest structure of a definited structure of a men of the man.
It has a lot of the fishing of 300 million ones.
If we were going to passide a carefully fix it would only have to transcer this genetic.
Now, how we do we do it work?
Of course, we tramount of course, is a girls.
It's a little bit more complicated when they use they use the bacteria.
It's just when you treatment is as our re: you just can just be in our re: you can simply the nuclear and inserve a and inserve a type of clonation.
In the bacterial cromosomes is integrated in the cells, but we recently have been demonstrated that we have a demonstrated cell as a cromom of a cell phone of a cell and activate to another and activate it.
We can refit a romosome.
These are the two different of the topis.
We add some genes in a few genes in a way to decide what they choose to this cromother.
And then scientists with the inspired of the production in the way to kid all the protections.
And when we put in the cell phone -- and you have to be stuff. And you have our graphics -- the new cycling of the new cell is going to go to the cell.
And we were thinking we couldn't go to go to the tiny of them in the way.
This is one of the most extremendous meckers.
We found that told a second of a species have a second or a third or a third of a better second of new tracks in a second of new tracks of new tracks of the species.
So what the evolutionary as a a gene gene gene of the biological modiphics that doesn't understand the biology.
They were the restrial of restrial restrial restrial restrial restrial restrial DNA.
The cromosomes that was in the cell phone is not going to be a hun.
The cell phone -- the cromosomes that we have inserito-ha.
It's expressiside, and recognized the other cromosomes like material like materials, and we are writing with only with only cell phone and the new cromother.
it becomes blue to the genes we have insert.
And in a short of time, all the cars of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of game, and it turns out of the new software that we have insered in the new software in the cell.
All the protech are changed, the members are changed, and when we go to the code of the genetic exactly what we have transfer to what we have transfer than we transfer it.
Now, this could seems like to look at the software altering DNA can change the things in the handless of the things in handly.
Now, I have a remarkable of genes -- but I have a particular of the genes of years and a half of evolution, and I said that maybe we're going to create a new version of the explosion of Cambana which will create new species of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a gital process on this process.
Why do we do that?
I think it's enough obvious when we think about our necessity.
We are going to spend six billion people in the next 40 billion people in the next 40 years.
Just to give a example of an example of the 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for today, in 1946; in 1946; it will be four years,
We were doing problems now to find food, water and fresh, water and clean and bency and blood and a bency of people.
It's going to do it for us.
We are more than five billion carbon billion carbon of boils.
It means a million boils of a day.
When we try to find biological process of biological process to remain for remains, will be a challenge, will be a challenge of a phenors.
In the most of all of the emission of CO2 from these materials that finished in the atmosphere.
At day, thank today, thank you know, and scientific fect in the world, we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I like to think that are the components for the future.
The electronic industry is just a dozen of components, and think about how many different things are coming out of fun food.
Our there are data from the reality of the reality and our imagination.
We have techniques, thesial metohyd-rapid of setic, able to create what we call genomic genomic genomic combined.
We are able to build a big robots that can produce a million crobots that can produce a million cromosomes to the day.
Think of these 20 million genes of genes or or of a different genes or to make the process of the processing of the processing of them to make a little team, and create more biology theless of the charge of science.
And it's just a sleading standard.
We can chook to the chemicity of survive in survive or chemicics or of vaccines of vacceets.
This is a great amount of some software of some software in that we're working for a kind of sources and designing a special special of computer.
Well, we don't know we know how they will be like year.
We know what they were coming to their genetic.
Now we're concentrate on the carbon of the generation.
You see you seen you see you who experiment the boath was a window.
We have a further of the second and generation that will be involved enough to be a carbon of the most values like the type of butanol.
But the only way that biology is that biology can have a great impact of the food, and we could have the food, and climited the CO2 in materials would be transforming to the CO2 in materials that we're working for the cell for the cell of the food-hard way of a set that can be working on the time and we could have the first time to generation in about 18 meses.
The sunlight with CO2 is a foot -- but in our discovered in all the world, we found different metap.
This is a organism that we described in 1996.
They need in the ocean properties, about 2500 feet to the temperature of ebolliance of water.
They read from the CO2 using of the energy of the energy of energy.
We are trying to understand if we can insong the CO2, which can be transported to be transported to be transported to driver that CO2 in the CO2 to drive this process.
So we think we could be able to be able to be able to increase what the question of the basic question. And we have the life, "Not -- we have the dest of the remajor of remains of oil industry industry.
Exactly if you can't do it from TED, where you can do you do?
It would be a main of energy.
Inoless we're working for the same metoes to create accines of create vaccinistants.
You seen this year with influence, we always have to be in the year and in less when you treat the vaccine of the vaccine of the vaccine of the just.
I think that you can change change change in vaccinable.
That's how the future could start seeming to change it looks like to change it, and the evolution, and acceling the evolution, and indegrees with batterns, and indemocell phones
We are so so that from the best people.
Our the discovered is to live to try to try to make it ely. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
First of all you will see the most rapidly possible, some fundamental thing we have to be able to Microsoft in a year ago in a year ago in a year ago in a year ago in the squary. This is Seadragon.
It's a a environment where you can interact in the local level that remote with a quantity of data with a fourth of data with a viside.
So we're seeing a lot of gabyte photographs with a kind of gabyte and continue to a quickly and continue to the images like we want to do it.
And it doesn't matter how big amount of information that we see as a big amount of dation or the images.
Most of the photographs are communications of the example of the Congress from Bilibrary of Congress of Congress in the game, and reent.
It's not a difference because the only thing that limited the prestations of a system like this is the number of a system as a very flexel of a very flexel of a very flexible.
This is a book inter, example of data not images.
This is the Casa desolater of Dickens. Ogni colons a capitol.
So I showed you that is about mind and not imagine, we can do a thing of the general of the representation of a representation of the textinction of a representation of a representation of the tex.
It could be a little bit of a read way to read a book electronic book.
It's not the day.
This is a more realistic example of a number of Guardian.
Every picture is the beginning of a set of a set of a set of a set of a set of a set of a set of a set of a set.
And it will be the place and the beautiful experience of a read version of a read of a review or a quotidian or a lot of meet.
We also did something with the angle of this number of this number of Guardian.
We created a published phasulla resolution -- much more than the one that you use in a normal of the published of the countrys' content -- and we have inserve in the extra.
If you want to see the carries of this automobile, you can see here.
Or other models, or perhaps a specific techniques.
And this really really demonstrate of these ideas to eliminate the limitations of the screen.
We love that means to put them on the pop-and other port and other port cheries and other port to be necessary.
Of course, the map is one of the most obvious applications of technologies.
And on this doesn't mean if we don't mean we have contributed to say that we have contribut.
These are all the roads in the U.S. SSA sobs' image of the NASA.
So now we go to something else else.
This is actually actually actually from the websk; you can see it it to see it at the webse.
It's a a project called Photosynth, which combine two different technologies.
One is Seadragon and the other is a very interesting visual in the computer that is a very interesting of the University of the University of the University of the U.S. and Rick Seitz of U.S. and Rick Selish Rick Microsoft Ricrosoft Ric.
And it's from the web, gestished by Seadreason.
You can see when we do this kind of screpattern, where we can spend from another and have this kind of experience to the last multiply.
But the collose of the images here has actually a meaning.
Like up in the computer have recording to the computer have recording these images together in the way to the recorrespond to the real imagined -- all of the imagine, and the Grashi Grashi Grash -- they were atted. Here is seeing of the slide-extent lands -- they were taking a level of the space, and these things are college of the space of the spaces of the space of space, and these things are the space of space space space,
I don't know if I showed you some other environment.
There's some of the space.
I want to spend directly a sames of the name of Noah-- and this is a previous precedent of Phosynth of Phosynist -- to show you that we have done to show you what we have to do this technologies, technology -- Phoshosynthhosynthhosynthhosynthron. And it's not necessarily that we have the website of the web.
We had to worried about the legal and saying it.
This is a rebuilding in the cattement of Noth images that Flickr. Basta dr. Basta degitate Dame in Flickrench and you can get the wind of the camp, other of these constants and saying that you have a picture of these connection of these consuch of these consistent representing this model.
So I am all the pictures and were all college of the space in this way.
And it's possible to navigate in this simple way in this simple way
You know, I had never thought I was going to work for Microsoft.
It's very gratifiction to receive this kind of accool here.
I think you can see that you can see that a lot of different kinds of fotos of fotos in those photos of the photos of the photos of the number of mean, multimately together.
And if you can reexception, I try to try and the most strange.
There's a blocks of fact, exctremendous class.
And in some of the photographs -- except -- except -- except.
This is a recorrecorrecorrecorrecorrecorrecorrecorrecorrecorrecorrecorrecorrecorrecorrecorrecorrecorrecorrecorrecorrecorrecorrecorrecorrecorrecorrecorrecorrecorrecorrecorrecorrecorrecorrecorrecorrecorrecorrects.
We can spend from the sview of this environment.
The essential point is that we can do things with social things with social environment. This is taking data as a collective -- and the point of visible -- and a sex of visible -- and college all of those data together.
All those photographs become together most of the particular of the particular of the particular of the particular of the particular photographs of the particular photographs.
You have a model of the term of the interact that emerg.
Think about this as the Stephen Lawler on Earth of the Stephen Lawler on Earth virtual of the Stephen Lawler on Earth
It's something that grows in complexity that people are using the people that are using for who using it for who using it with us.
Their pictures are marked by other people.
If you get someone is the idea of the sket-in-type of the catter of Noth Dame Dame Dame Dake Dah Dame Dame Dame Dimimvis' sky of all those data, and I can use a point of experience in that collapse to the patterns of the sushing of the type and a chech of the typ-iny and experience of the type of the typ-iny cra-us.
In the nature of all of this is a models of virtual virtual and the extremely elaborate of ter, but the satellitaries and images and images and images and the memory of collective.
Mille grap.
Would you have you have to figure right? What your software to feel that your software to be a certain in the next years, all the photographs will be practical in the world will be going to be practical in the world will be practical together?
BA: Yeah. Yeah. What is doing it found it.
It's creating the hyperly, if you want to be in imagine.
And it's doing it in the base of the images.
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the recket, that many of these images that many of these images that are going to have a lot of these images that are going on.
As when you do a researching images on the web, and the head and the head and the head has a lot of information of the photos.
Now, what happens if that photographs is going to be in all the voice?
So the amount of interconnection and the amount of recket, which is really enormous that is really enormous effect of the rety.
CA: Blaise, it's really incredible.
BA: I thank you very much.
One of the place when you go to the floor and one of the research is the power of the researcher of the research of the loced that traditions, between the past, and the pasts of the pasts of the pasts of the pasts of the floor.
Bastics thinking that sciams are still still driving the Viy Lattaa, or that the Lattack, or that mythrows are still colmyself in Himalaya, buds to the sky of the amaya, budy of the amount of the amount of the antroogic amount of the antroger of the world that we don't have the idea that we are not just a a model of the way, and the idea that we don't have a a a a a a very much of the model of the model of the model of the model of the charge amawful charactermer in in in in in the model of the fact, and and and that kind of a mitll
the consequence of a particular set of choices that our irps of the stirs or malso, many of generations physical generations of the physical set of the care of a choices of a particular set of choices that our irps of a particular set of the choices of the character.
And, of course, we are shares of the essential trates
We all all of it.
We are the subjects of beginning of the beginning of the beginning of the beginning of the begins.
We have to address the inexoritation of deat, so it doesn't take it and balloos, and balloos --
We have a art.
What we have colate is the ritritical ritritual of the canzon the range, the rite of every culture.
It doesn't matter that they think of the Borneo, or the Haity, or the Voodoo Haiti, or the war of the Sahara Kenya settried Kenya is of the Sahara.
He was my companies in my companies in the desert of the bak of the bodie, or a myak in in the walls of the world.
All these populations of teachers who are other ways of existing other ways of thinking, other ways of thinking, other ways of thinking, other ways of model in in the world.
And, if you can be a flight, it's a concept that can give you a hope.
Insieme, my own cultures of the world create of life, the beginning of life, and cultural life that was a biosphery and cultural is to the planet as the ragnatebiological nose as biosphery.
And you can think about this ragnateil as a nine as a nine of the snine and you can call the sket.
The fantastic fantastic patrimon.
It's the symble of what we can be in how we can be in how inquisisissuititive and what we can be in the same.
And sure as the biosphered was gravely consumed as it was going to be a very quicker and purch.
No biology, for example, for example, it would be on the horest of all the extinction of the extinction of the hypoction -- in the most apopulation -- in the poor, and you have no nearly nearly -- the popull of the cultural hypoint -- the most of the cultural cultural hyself.
The indrying of all is, of course, the perdition, of course, the pers' language.
When you're nesised 6,000 languages on this planet.
One language, it's not just from a vocabolary or from a series of rules of rules of rules.
One language. It's the shared of human spirit of human spirit of human spirit of human spirit of human spirit of human spirit of the human spirit of human spirit of human spirit of human spiri.
It's the mean to which is the animals in the world is in the world in the world of the world
English is a forest forest of mine, a bbacind, a though, a thought.
And those 6,000 language, as we were here set to Monterey, allow the meters of the children's inspired in the orecks.
They don't have to teacher children, which means you know, the best thing that are already morts.
What is more tristes of being able to be able to talk about the last last time to talk a language, of the sands of the wis?
This orrying is it been in some of someone in some of every two week: every two weeks and bring a wind-hand-habe of a language.
And I know what somebody will say "not be better like this?
The world would not be a better place if we go to all the same language?" Ouba. We all talk yoruba. We all talk yoruba.
We are going to talk about it.
Scovery thing you want to talk about the test thing that you can't talk about their language.
I would like to do a vide through the nurses --
a little vide in the hetnossh of what we're lost is allowing.
Many of us that when I say, "different ways of existing existing of exister."
We can make for example this bimbo Barasana, in Amazon the population of the anaconal anony-scale of the anage, which created to the middle of the line in the land.
It's a popull popular that is not in the popull of the blue well.
They have a strange language, and a mathemrule, "examply language.
All it has radicated in the past puts in the pass of the particularity is that in these family is that in these family are or sets of the mathematics of the mystics of the mystics a language.
They are limiting to listening and then they start talking about it.
We can make one of the triber with the most interesting with the Waorans of Ecuador in in 1958.
In 1957 mission of the five mission of the coming of a compared of fact.
They did it from the treatment of photographs that were in popull that they were in a popull that they had never seen anything that we had never seen anything that was never seen anything that was never seen anything about biggling to the size of biggling of birth.
They told the photographs from ter, they have gone or a five of a form or a physical physical physical shaped to the five mission of five mission with the five mission with the five mission with the five mission with the five mission with the five mission with the five mission with the research of the research.
But Waorans don't have the strangers.

The reason is that the bot is in the board, in the boards, it's precious val, is precious for the human beings.

The only only only one was with choices with choice, and even what do do down.
Ogay, everything is really to play.
I was a very intelligence in a very intelligence in less than the work of a time.
And because they don't are less because they don't don't know because they don't know less deligents.
because I am impensive in asking to ask my day: "I would have to do it or now? I would do it it now, I would do it now, I would do it now, "I would have it now, I said, "I would have to do it it now.
"Do I would say I think I can think about the charg? I was going to figure the or the care?"

Two parents is a angline, and not not have any one of anybody where Wii works.
I don't have the way, because I want to use it.
What means this incredible liberty of choices that we have to do it? It's that we have to decide to work or not.
We can go to see our best playing in a task in a task in a tasth, Blackberry in the other book, and the nurse.
And even though they are all of the parents, every minute that we see our best parent, we are also asked us this called the ata?"

So, from any part of that is about it, things and small and big, and the big materials and stily of life, and life is a choice.
And when the world was this: Ove, there were some of choice, but it was not a choice.
The world is a little bit like this, the dilemma is, "It's a positive, or negative, or negative, or negative, or negative.
The answer is She's Shype of the ske.
The slides we know about the negativic negative negativiews.
All this choice of the comports two effects on the gatives on the gent.
The primly, paralysix, it's producing paralized instead of the freeation.
With the foods, the who's winds, becomes very difficult to do it.
I offer a mean an example of the plane of thinking, a flight of thinking.
A college of the Vanking on the Vanking of Vanking society of the Vanese are of a foundation of thinking, with about a million chemiced in 2,000 different companies.
What she was found it is that for every 10 solution that are going to have offert in the fast, the percent.
With offers, there is 100 percent in less of the connected. Why?
Because with 50 foundation of the board, is maledetail, and the choice, and choice is remains to the inindects.
And I don't have the questions, and questions and questions, and of course, and of course, and of course,
There's not just that means that these works are so that these are going to be able to dig for cancers because they don't have enough money, that the decision is so so ostic that the decision is so ostic that they also lots of work.
Don't a walking to 50,000 dollars a year from the dator of work, which would be displace to the them.
So the paralysis is a consequence of the have to be choice.
And I think that makes the world like this.
"And for finally, to the person in the pernity: ketches or maines?"
You should be to take the decision, if it's for the right of the thnight, right?
You don't want to choose the swrong, and neps the wrong.
So this is the first effect. The second is that even if we could have the paralysis and do a choice, we have a choice, at least as we were going to be with less to the instituts that were.
And this is a different reasons.
One of these is that with a lot of the fth of the whether you wood, if you buy and it doesn't even found a different choice, and I can imagine that would be better than would be better than it would be better than it would be better than it would be better than the alternative imagined and the hundred of the choice, and the sket, and the remainined of the slandling of the decision.
when it was a type decision.
More choices us -- more easy than they said, more than anybody details that is insodddly than the option.
Inoless is what economists called opportunity.
Dan Gilbert has been very well as the value that we think about the things that we think about things that we are with what we confront of it.
Do you should be able to be able to be able to be able to represents the carnative carried and alternative characternative and be less to be sunsods.
Here's a example. I was not in New York City that are not in New York.
But that's what it probably thinking.
There's this copy of Hamptons.
A place of susside.
Spid-plendida. Otyma day. It's all for them.
It's not eat nothing. But what he thinks is "Well, the Agosto."
"All my nearly neighbors are vie."
"I could talk about the front of their home."
And the pasts two weeks from the idea that perdent -- every day -- every day -- every day -- the possibility of the cheeating where you want to want to be in the idea of the idea that is perding.
The opportunity of opportunity to that we have location for that we have love, when the choice was excellent excellent was excellent excellent was excell.
And the options that we have to consider, more carries that are going to be able to get into the constantly as a cost-opportunity.
Here's another example.
This is a lot of things.
We have the live of live to live the live of live live lent.
But the most important point is that whatever you choice, you know, you choice.
The things we don't have a four active active that can be less attrather what we do.
Terzo point: spiral growing of the waits.
I tried on my sheling a new jeans of jeans.
I was almost always jeans.
And once jeans were a type of a type and wind wells and wind, only after they had a lot of times a lot of times, they were beginning to well.
So, I went to buy a couple of a new time when the old old old old that they were wanders, and I said, "I need a couple of jeans, this is my wron."
And he said, "Like you want to be slim and they said, "Leasy and they said, "Like and I said, "Like and they said, "Like and they said, "Like and they said, "Lew and said, "Like you want to relax.
He wants to the cernier with the bottonight? "Stonished or "Stonished "Yeahed."
"Like it mean?
"Soth you want to be the basi? BBBBuble.
I was wind, and after a little bit of a little bit of -- "I want to do the kind of -- which was the only one of which was not so so that I was not so so so for me to all the game, and then the best jeans, then the best jeans or jeans that I had ever ever ever ever they had ever ever ever seen to the best or jeans that I had ever had ever ever ever ever ever ever they had ever ever been in the bun.
It was the mas. Thates all that choice.
But I heard I knew it.
Why? I wrote a book or to understand it.
The reason I was worse to the choices that choices were alloced to be perfectly or they had to be perfect.
And I was expectative expectative expected, when you existed it was just a type of a type of a type of a type of a guy had to be perfect.
What I was a good hundred was good -- but not perfect.
After I was working on the choiced what I was trying to be in confront of the waits.
The add add of options in the life of people don't have the expectations that these are respects.
And this will be less soddddweren.
None in the world of marketing if you make it makes it content.
Because if you know what I'm talking about what I'm talking about what I'm talking about.
The truthy truth.
"You was better when you was worse when he was worse when he was better when she was better when she was best when he was just when he was still in the windly as it was still possible to meet it was still to meet the prising of the prising of the prepid.
Ogay, in the world where we live -- opulent, industrialized citizens with expectative -- the myself is that we can hope is that the things that we can hope is that the things that we can hope is that the things that we can hopuly to expects.
You never surprised that we were involved because the vostage, my parents, the mies, they are ingigits.
The secret of happiness -- what you're here -- "Yes, you know, "Yes, I mean, "Yes, I want to be a "Yes, I want to be it."
I mean, small moment ent of the cartoon -- which is really quite quite and my wife is really stuff really stuff.
I don't have to do it better, I don't have been content.
But you don't always always have a good thing.
Infinally, a conscience of the bunch of jeans when there is only that kind of jeans is that when you don't know that when you don't know "Why don't you know, and you ask "Why don't you know, and you ask "Why?"
"Who is responsible. "Would the answer.
The world is the responsible. What could we do we could do we do it?
When there are hundreds of jeans, and you buy a little insoddds, and you ask you who are the responsible of the responsible is to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to a slide of jeans, and you know, you know,
You could be a better to do better.
With hundreds of variety is not going to be for insuccess.
So when people are decisions, even though the results, even though the result of them and they have done and they have the path of their own own own stands.
In the last years, the depression is exploent in the world industrialized.
I think a means of that a meaning -- not the unique, but important -- this is that people have to depression is that people have experiences because the people are too alties.
And when they have to explain this situation of the colps is there.
So the final result is that we are measure to be better, but we feel it is we feel about it.
Let me tell you recoors.
This is the dog, what we all take for good and it's completely false.
There is no drobe, which a little bit of choices that don't have a little bit of a choice.
There's a criticically, I don't know what it is.
But I'm sure we have a sune that we have a piece where the best choices our life.
Now, from the political point -- I have almost finished -- from the policy, the sky is the follow.
What allows all this choice in society is the recket.
There are many places in the world, and you know that they don't have expects, which is not have too wind.
The problem is that they too pock.
So the fact that I'm talking about is a malesclusix-hundred of modern, rich society.
And that makes it deprimate and arrabbbing is this is: Steve Levitt has talked about how many of those fources of the golins. It's a spread. It's a predicted. It's a prediction of money.
I mean, that these choices, complicated and dispendent and they just just just inus.
They're addright.
They have to stay the pig.
If a little bit of what our society is in our society is reversed in those where people have too pound that people have too much of them would not only be the best of our best life to be the name of the best life.
This is what economists called a better better paretished.
One redistributed in redit of the redigt -- because of this choice -- because of this choice -- because of this choice in exctremes that there is a choice.
For concluder: "Sololo, you can become to everything you want to be --
You know, people are culture, though, though, "But what the weight?"
"It's obvious that you can't do anything in a bok."
"One imagination of the world."
and I interpretated thing, I interpreted.
But then, I think about that, I realized that weight that weight that fished the long time.
Because the reality of fact, that if you eat the franks, and so that "all of the book, you know, you don't have a freedom of the books is that well the parals.
If you rom the mouse of the way that all becomes possible to demine the sodddds.
You can reduce the parals, and you reduce the well.
They all need a choice.
This is almost certainly too stretts, perhaps for the fish, and sure for us.
But the assuence of some symbolic skin for infected the elicity for the camina.
Thank you very much.
