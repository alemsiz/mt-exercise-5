The last year I've got these <unk> for <unk> that the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, which is <unk> the <unk> <unk>, <unk> the <unk> of the United States, <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> percent.
And we <unk> this <unk> of the problem because it doesn't <unk> the <unk> of the ice.
The <unk> <unk> is, in a sense, the heart of the <unk> <unk> of the global <unk>.
It's <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The next <unk> will be a <unk> <unk> on the last last 25 years.
<unk> <unk> are <unk>.
As you see, you see, <unk> to the blue <unk>.
That's the ice in <unk>, which you <unk> <unk> in the summer.
You can see that the <unk> ice, of five or more, it's like the <unk>, which here is how your <unk> <unk>.
In 25 years, it's past, so it's in this.
This is a problem because the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> around the ocean <unk> <unk>, where there are very much of <unk> <unk> that, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> are <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> at the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk>, that might <unk>, <unk> this point of <unk>, <unk> this point of not.
In some <unk> <unk> <unk> is already <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> with a <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>! <unk>: <unk> <unk>. The question is good. The question is if you <unk> it.
A reason is that this <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> from the <unk>.
This is a river in <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> never had to <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This is the river <unk>, in <unk> <unk>.
If you want to know how you <unk> <unk> the level of the sea level of the sea level.
These <unk> are <unk>.
<unk> other part of the planet: <unk>, the most <unk> of the ice of the planet.
The last month, the last month, the <unk> of the ice is in <unk>, and that <unk> <unk> <unk>, and that <unk> <unk> on some <unk> <unk>, <unk> in the <unk>.
<unk> to six feet of the <unk> level, like <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, the third third <unk> of ice, you see new <unk>, which you see new <unk>,
The <unk> percent of the world population <unk> <unk> from <unk> <unk> from what <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>: This is the <unk> of water <unk> <unk> of this city.
The <unk> is <unk>.
But when you <unk>, the same thing is <unk>.
In the <unk> <unk> on <unk> <unk> is <unk> percent.
<unk> <unk> are in crisis.
<unk>, as you have read, they're <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> in the world <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> are <unk> to a <unk> out of the normal and without <unk>.
<unk> times <unk> in the last 30 years of the <unk> <unk>.
This is a <unk> of the <unk>.
If you look at the context of the context of the <unk>.
In the last five years we've <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> every day -- 25 million <unk> in every day.
Look at the <unk> area of the <unk> <unk>, <unk>, and on both <unk> <unk>, and on both the <unk> <unk>, where there's a <unk> <unk> of oxygen.
The most <unk> of the global global global global warming, and <unk>, which is 20 percent, is the use of <unk> <unk>.
The oil is a problem, and the <unk> is even even even even.
The United States are one of the two countries with more <unk> <unk> <unk> in China.
And they're going to build many other <unk>.
But we're <unk> to a <unk> <unk> of direction.
These are the <unk> projects in the last years and some <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And so, there's a <unk> <unk> <unk> in our country.
The <unk> of the oil and the oil <unk> million dollars in the last year to <unk> the last year to <unk> the <unk> <unk>, which is a <unk>.
I'm going to <unk> me --
<unk> <unk>, where I live, where I live, there was a <unk> of <unk> billion <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Maybe you've seen it on the <unk>.
This is the second <unk> of <unk> in America.
It's happened around <unk>.
The <unk> of one of the <unk> of <unk> was this.
<unk>: <unk> ♫ ♫ <unk> <unk> <unk> is a <unk> <unk> and happy.
It's <unk> here in America, and it's going to <unk> our economy.
<unk> the <unk> is always more <unk>.
It's good price, <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> it.
<unk>: <unk> here is much of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The biggest <unk> society on the <unk> is <unk>. This is his <unk>. This is his <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> <unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk> -- <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> -- not know what they're talking about.
<unk>: So the <unk> for the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> two <unk>.
This is one of them, a part.
<unk>: <unk>: <unk> <unk> see the changes like a <unk> <unk> <unk> to our business.
For this <unk> our <unk> is a big amount of money in a big amount of money in a <unk> <unk> for the <unk>.
In fact, the <unk> is not <unk>.
We think it's <unk> -- it's also a good <unk>.
So we don't have <unk> change.
We're going to do us.
<unk>: <unk> <unk>: <unk> <unk> -- you've heard very much.
So I <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> as <unk> <unk> to <unk> as <unk> <unk>.
<unk>! The cars are a little <unk>, but this is the sound of the technology of the technology of <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> of <unk> is between the <unk> of the global global global global global global <unk>, but the technology of <unk> that you see everything.
<unk> <unk>: This is the <unk> technology of <unk> <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to the question of the <unk> <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk>, the economy, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, the <unk> crisis.
The <unk> that <unk> all: our <unk> <unk> by <unk> <unk> <unk>, like the <unk> <unk> and oil <unk>.
Now, there's a new <unk>, <unk> solution to <unk>.
<unk> America: 100 percent of energy energy <unk>, in 10 years.
A <unk> for <unk> America to work, more <unk> <unk>, and help to <unk> the global global global global <unk>.
<unk>, a solution that we're going to solve our problems.
<unk> America.
<unk>: This is the last.
<unk>: <unk>: <unk> is <unk> energy to America.
One of the most <unk> ways of <unk> <unk> from <unk> <unk> that we <unk> our planet.
<unk>: The future is here. <unk>, <unk>, a new network network.
<unk> <unk>: <unk> <unk> for places.
<unk>: <unk> America. It's time to be <unk>.
<unk>: A old old <unk> says, "If you want to go to <unk>, you go to <unk>, you go to go to <unk>.
If you want to go to the <unk>, you. "
We have to go to a long time.
Thank you very much.
<unk> year at TED, I did an <unk> on <unk>.
And I'm going to <unk> to <unk> on how it works.
So, I <unk> it. And for those that the other time, they were the <unk> is the most <unk> of the <unk> <unk>.
<unk> is <unk> of <unk> the <unk> that were less than a <unk> of a second <unk> of the universe -- to <unk> million times a second.
All of that's just <unk>.
This is the car <unk>.
We're <unk> these <unk> <unk> in the <unk>.
This is what I work. It's called <unk> -- it's <unk> <unk> <unk> feet and it's a <unk> of <unk> feet.
This is a <unk> image of <unk> in this is <unk>.
The 10 <unk> of the last year we've <unk> the first time.
And this picture was <unk> by <unk>.
It was because of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of control.
It's a image of the first <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, with a part of <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk>.
In other words, when I <unk> that the <unk> <unk>, <unk> that the <unk> <unk>, which is a great <unk>.
I don't know if I was this to <unk> us to <unk> us to <unk>, when somebody on Google and <unk> that the <unk> <unk> was this.
What means we had a <unk> impact on the <unk>.
<unk> a week later, there was a problem with the machine, they had to these <unk> here -- these <unk> <unk>.
These <unk> <unk> <unk> when the machine works to the <unk> of <unk>.
Now, <unk> between you <unk> <unk> <unk>, "It's not true." It's not true. "
And instead can do that because when they're very <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
So, less <unk> degrees, to a <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> of space between the stars, these <unk> can bring that.
In one of the <unk> between the most of the <unk> <unk> in <unk>, there was a <unk> of <unk>.
So, the <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk>.
This was the result.
Now, this is more <unk> if you think that these <unk> <unk> <unk> more than 20 <unk>, and that you have <unk> of about 30 <unk>.
They have <unk> about 50 <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, what then we have done.
We have them <unk> and <unk>.
Now, they're <unk> all at their place.
<unk> the end of <unk> <unk> will be <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, and we <unk> to get to <unk> data to <unk> or <unk>, and we can go to what our <unk> to find out what the <unk> is the <unk> that <unk> the universe.
Now, of course, in a way, these <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> of science and <unk> <unk> the <unk> of science and <unk> <unk>.
I think the fact that is so hard, the fact of the fact, I think that's the value of things like <unk>.
I want to end with the words of one <unk> <unk>, which, which, <unk>, which, <unk>, his <unk> <unk> <unk>, his <unk> <unk> <unk>, he said, "<unk> is <unk> for the human mind as <unk> as <unk> as <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk>,
Thank you.
I want to start to <unk> <unk> when, <unk>, <unk> with children, <unk> with <unk>.
As we could <unk> and <unk>, and <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> in fact, and we <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> <unk> to the way that we've got much of the world around us.
So, by <unk> <unk> <unk> of our <unk> <unk> with objects, and <unk> my <unk> <unk> <unk>, and my <unk> <unk> <unk>, and I started <unk>, and I started <unk>, and then, when we use a computer, instead of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>,
and we <unk> our <unk>?
The question was so interesting that we <unk> to explore the answer, you can actually actually <unk> the <unk>.
In words, a <unk> is a computer computer <unk> like a <unk>.
In words, a <unk> is a computer computer <unk> like a <unk>.
You can <unk> them with your hand, they can <unk> to <unk> them, and they're a screen and they have a screen and a <unk> <unk>.
But <unk>, they're <unk> objects, like <unk>, you can just <unk>.
The <unk> is the example of a new <unk> of <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> the <unk> information.
And I <unk> as they're more <unk>, <unk> of the movement, and other, and then hand that hand, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, and other <unk>, we can explore them, and we can <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> with some simple example.
This <unk> is <unk> to show you video of video: if you <unk> it in a <unk>, the video so, if you <unk> the other <unk>.
These <unk> <unk> are <unk> <unk> of other other.
If you <unk> them, you know what they <unk> around.
If they're <unk>, you can <unk> and they can <unk> a little.
If they're <unk>, you can <unk> and they can <unk> a little.
We also also have their movement and <unk>.
We've got <unk> that one of the interesting <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on data, "<unk>" a color like a <unk>.
In this case, we have three <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and I can <unk> to <unk> the color of the color in the <unk>, where you <unk>.
and I can <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> in the color of the color of the color in the <unk>.
If you're too, we can <unk> a little place.
I'm also going to give you a chance to <unk>, the <unk>, and <unk> <unk> where people can try to make things things things, and <unk> <unk>.
I'm --
This is a <unk> <unk> of <unk> that I do with a <unk> program.
So, we have a game of words that is in half <unk> and <unk>.
<unk>, at every <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk>.
Then, then you know, about 30 seconds, and you have a new <unk> <unk> and new chance to try.
Thank you.
Here's here, the children <unk> in <unk> <unk>, I did them in the way that I've got a video.
They're <unk> very.
And one of the interesting things of this <unk> is that you have to <unk> people.
<unk> only, "<unk> of words," and they know what to do.
Here's here, people who's <unk>.
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk>, there's the <unk>.
In fact, he wanted to <unk>.
They were just <unk>, for him.
Now, this is an <unk> of a <unk> <unk>.
<unk> to build a <unk> for the <unk> of <unk>.
It can <unk> new <unk>, <unk> their <unk>,
It can <unk> new <unk>, <unk> their <unk>,
So, that's doing it.
<unk>: The sun is <unk>.
David <unk>: Now, he <unk> a <unk> in the <unk>.
<unk>: The <unk> <unk>.
<unk> work!
So, <unk> the <unk> and <unk> can make the <unk> <unk> the <unk> --
<unk>: <unk>!
<unk> your story.
<unk>: <unk>!
<unk>: It's a story with the end, and you can understand him how you <unk> you know.
<unk>: It's a story with the end, and you can understand him how you <unk> you know.
<unk>: <unk>, <unk>.
<unk>: The last example I've got the time to show you is one <unk>, <unk> <unk>, and <unk> music.
It's a <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> music.
The <unk> here <unk> from <unk> as the <unk>, and the <unk>.
<unk> of these has four <unk> <unk>, and you can <unk> what to use.
You can also <unk> these <unk> <unk> in a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And I just just <unk> a sound "sound and a <unk> <unk> <unk>."
These are actually that you can control from the <unk>, like <unk> and the <unk>.
I <unk> it to a particular sound and then <unk> to <unk>.
And then there are the fact, they're <unk> to <unk> the whole <unk> <unk>.
<unk> as it works.
<unk>: <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> in two <unk> <unk>, "<unk> <unk>," <unk> <unk>, <unk>, the other <unk>.
Now, let's go to a <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> <unk>: Now <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk>: <unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk>, so I can <unk> the <unk> <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>: <unk> the whole <unk> <unk> the whole <unk> <unk> of a side of side or the other.
<unk>: <unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> to the <unk> to <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>: I can <unk> the <unk> <unk>. "
So I don't have to <unk> before, but I can <unk>, <unk> or more <unk>.
And now, I can <unk> the whole <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> "<unk>" <unk>. "
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is to build new <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> always <unk> to how to work work and <unk>.
And today, I had time to show you one of the <unk> of this <unk> <unk>, and also some chance that we're going to find out of the lab.
The concept I want to <unk> is that is <unk> this new generation of objects to <unk> with the media <unk>, which we're going to be <unk> in our world that we want.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the now of you.
I'm a <unk>.
<unk> books is my <unk>, but it's more than this, of course.
It's also love and my <unk> of my life.
And I don't know that you can change.
But, I said, this, something particular is happened in my career, and my career, I <unk> to <unk> the whole whole <unk> with this work.
The particular thing is that I <unk> this book, this book called "<unk>," <unk>, "which," which, "which, <unk>," which <unk>, and <unk> a big <unk>, and <unk> a big <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
And the result is that <unk> <unk> now, people like I was <unk>.
<unk> -- <unk>, <unk>!
<unk> to me now, I'm <unk> to me to me, "You don't know that you're not going to do better?
You don't think about it to write to write to write to write more than being able to create a book that can <unk> to someone? "
What can you <unk>? "
It's <unk>, you know.
But it might be <unk>, I remember the <unk> me that more than 20 years ago, when I was a <unk> -- I was a <unk> -- I was a <unk>.
<unk> <unk> to <unk> the same <unk>.
And people said, "Don't <unk> to be <unk>?
You don't think the <unk> of <unk> you?
You don't think about this <unk> to do this <unk> to do all the life without anything is going to be out and <unk> <unk> with your <unk> <unk> <unk>? "
<unk> so, you know.
The answer -- the little answer to all these questions is, "You know."
Well, I think of all those things.
I've always had <unk>.
And I also have <unk> of other things that people don't have <unk>.
As the <unk> and other things.
But, as I'm going to write what I thought and I thought I thought I thought and I thought I thought I thought and I thought I thought I thought I thought and I thought I thought I thought and <unk> me?
Is it <unk>?
It's <unk> that anybody who <unk> <unk> to be <unk> by a job that you're going to do.
But what's so particular in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in a way that other <unk> don't do?
How my father, for example, he was a <unk> <unk> <unk> and I don't remember one time in his <unk>, and I don't remember?
There was never -- that <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of John <unk>, how do you go?
<unk>'t <unk> so, <unk>?
<unk>, the <unk> <unk>, like group, they don't have any <unk>, <unk> the <unk> of being <unk> <unk>.
We <unk>, we have enough this <unk>, and not only <unk> <unk>, but we have this <unk> of being <unk> <unk>.
And they don't know that other that look at the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, young and often often for their own.
And even the those who don't have <unk> to be <unk> by their <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, first of <unk>, <unk> said, "Every book," Every book, "<unk> me a little bit of" <unk> <unk> about the work of their work.
But I don't <unk> when we've heard these things so much like we've heard these things so much <unk> and <unk> the <unk> that <unk> and <unk> the <unk> that <unk> is in some way and <unk> that art and <unk> the art, and the art, <unk>, <unk> to the <unk>.
And the question I want to <unk> you to <unk> all here today is, you're going to <unk> this idea?
I'm going to show this -- because also <unk> by a <unk> <unk> of a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
I think it's <unk>.
And I think it's also <unk> and I don't want to <unk> <unk> in the next century.
I think it's better <unk> our big <unk> to live.
And I know, in my case -- in my case -- it would be very <unk> to start to <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in my career.
<unk> -- I look at, I'm pretty young, I've been young,
I've still been working about four <unk> of work in me.
And it's very <unk> that any <unk> now in the world like the <unk> <unk> from the world like the work that <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, because we all all more or less than the -- is that my <unk> <unk>.
Oh, <unk>, <unk>, which thought!
You know, this is the kind of thought that <unk> a person to start to <unk> <unk> at the <unk>, and I don't want to to do that.
I'm going to do this work that I love.
So, the question is, how?
And so so much, after many <unk>, which the way to work to write what I'm going to write to write what I'm going to write, OK?
I have to find a <unk> <unk> <unk> in me, and my <unk> <unk> <unk>, and my natural <unk> on what I'm <unk> to <unk>, and my <unk> <unk> to go to the last year on how to look at the last year, and then then you have to find more <unk> and <unk> in the ideas to see the best ideas.
about how to help people <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> of creativity.
And that <unk> me to <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
<unk> because they <unk> to <unk> and then <unk> back.
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> -- people don't believe that <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>, OK?
It <unk> that creativity was this <unk> <unk> <unk> and that <unk> to the men from a few <unk> <unk> and <unk>, for <unk> and <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> these <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> creativity "<unk>."
<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> from <unk>.
<unk> were the same idea, but <unk> that species of the species of the <unk>.
The <unk> is <unk>, because the <unk> doesn't really really really <unk> that a <unk> <unk>.
<unk> that a <unk> <unk> was this species of <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of a artist, a <unk> artist, and that <unk> <unk> out of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> here, that's the <unk> <unk> that I talk about -- that <unk> you <unk> you <unk> you <unk> that you <unk> you <unk> you <unk> you can work from your work.
And all they all <unk> that was so that you know, right?
So, <unk> artists were <unk> by <unk> things, like for example, not?
If your work was <unk> <unk> <unk> all the <unk>, all that <unk> <unk>, all that <unk> <unk> <unk>.
If your work, it wasn't all all your work, right?
<unk> that was your <unk> to be a <unk>.
And so people <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity in <unk> for very time.
Then the <unk> <unk> and all <unk>, and we <unk> this idea, we put the human idea of the universe on the center of the universe, and the <unk> and <unk> without <unk> space and <unk> and <unk> without <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk>.
This was the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and people <unk> to think that <unk> creativity.
And the first time, you know, in the history, and that <unk> to this artist or that artist to a person with the <unk>.
And I have to <unk>, I think that was a big <unk>.
I think I think you know, a person person to believe that that I would like to be a <unk> like a <unk>, and the <unk> of all the <unk> of all the <unk>, <unk> and <unk> <unk> is a <unk> <unk> to the human <unk>.
It's like to somebody of someone to <unk> the sun.
<unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> all these <unk> <unk> on the <unk>.
And I think it was this <unk> <unk> to <unk> the <unk> <unk> 500 years.
And if this is true, and I think it's, the question is, and now?
Can we we do it?
<unk> to go to a more <unk> <unk> of the relationship between human relationship between human relationship between human relationship between human relationship.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we can't <unk> 500 years of thinking in a <unk> of 18 minutes.
And there's probably people in the audience that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of <unk>, you know, you know, people <unk> to <unk> on their projects.
You know, you don't know that you all about this.
But the question that I'd like to <unk> is -- why don't don't you?
Why don't you like this?
Because it's more than any other thing that has ever heard for the <unk> <unk> of the process of the <unk> process.
One process that you know, how anybody who has ever <unk> to do something -- so, so all here -- so, you know, you know, you know, you know, a process of <unk>.
And, in fact, it can <unk> <unk>.
I've done this <unk> with the <unk> <unk> <unk>, which has been a <unk> for the <unk>, but that was a <unk> for all the life and said that in his <unk> <unk> in his <unk> <unk> <unk>, and then he <unk> it, if you <unk> it in the <unk>, and then <unk> <unk>, if you <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
I said that was like a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And that <unk> <unk> to her from her <unk>.
I <unk> it to <unk>, because he was <unk> the land on the land.
<unk> of have one thing to have one thing to do that point and was, his <unk>, "<unk> like a <unk>."
And so I was <unk> to home and it was <unk> by this <unk>, and it didn't have another piece of paper and a <unk> enough <unk>, and a <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> on the page.
<unk> times times, they don't have enough, so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> without able to be <unk> and <unk> without able to be able to <unk> through the <unk> and she would <unk> to <unk> through the <unk>, and she said, "he said," I mean, "he said," I'm going to be enough. "
Then there were those times -- this piece of the never <unk> -- there were <unk>. And there were <unk>, OK?
So, he was <unk> to home and he was trying to paper paper and <unk> the <unk> <unk> through, and <unk> a <unk> <unk> in the while he was <unk>, and then he was how if you <unk> with the other hand and then he was trying to <unk>.
<unk> the <unk> <unk>.
And in these cases, the <unk> would be <unk> on the page and <unk> <unk>, but the last last last last last last last last <unk>.
So when I <unk> <unk> -- it's <unk>, it's just <unk> to my <unk> process.
I don't all my process -- I'm not a <unk>!
I'm a <unk>, and my way of way to the same <unk> every day and work on the same <unk> every day and work on the <unk>.
But even I even, I've <unk> against that what, sometimes, sometimes.
And I think that also <unk> many of you have <unk>.
You know, if the work and ideas I could <unk> me to <unk> <unk> by a <unk> <unk>.
And what is this?
And how can we <unk> to it in it way to do your head, but it's a lot, but that <unk> us?
For how I'm going to me, the best example, which I've got a different <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk>, and you know, <unk>, for the <unk> of life is the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk>, trying to <unk> <unk>, <unk> these species of <unk> <unk>.
But then I <unk>, you know, and a day as he was <unk> on a <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> all for him.
<unk> <unk>, and all of a <unk> <unk> this little <unk> of <unk>, which is <unk> <unk>, which is, <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, you know, it's wonderful, but not how <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It doesn't have a piece of paper, it doesn't have a <unk>.
So I can see this sort of <unk> of <unk> to <unk> in him, "I'm going to <unk>, and I'm going to <unk>, and I'm going to see this song.
I'm not enough and I can't <unk>. "
And instead of the <unk>, you're <unk>.
<unk> the whole process of <unk> and he did something new process.
<unk> just the sky and said, "<unk>, you don't see that I'm <unk>?"
"You know, you can write a song now?
If you really want to <unk>, you know, you can <unk> to <unk> <unk> to you.
<unk>, <unk> to <unk> <unk> else today.
<unk> <unk> <unk>. "
And his process <unk> <unk> after this.
I don't work, the work was still <unk> like always.
But the process, and the <unk> that <unk> was <unk> when he was <unk> when he was <unk> when he was <unk> when he <unk> the <unk> that <unk> and <unk> it was not to be a <unk> thing.
But I'm going to <unk> this <unk>, and this <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> and that <unk> it was <unk>.
So how I <unk> that story to change a little bit of the way that I <unk> it's going to be <unk> and I've been <unk> me and I <unk> me to <unk> a time.
This idea, I was <unk> when I was <unk>, "<unk>," and <unk> in a <unk> of those <unk> in which we're working on something that we're working on something and not not working on something that is going to be a <unk>, and it's going to be a <unk>,
It doesn't just <unk>, just the <unk> book.
And I think about <unk> this project.
But then then I <unk> to <unk> <unk> air and <unk> us.
So I <unk> my <unk> <unk> on the <unk> and <unk> my <unk> <unk> to a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And I said, "<unk>," <unk>, what I think if this book, I don't be <unk> <unk> my <unk>, no?
Because you see I'm <unk> all that I've got to do that that.
So if you want to <unk> and you want to do your part.
OK. But if you don't do it, you know what you know, you know, you don't know.
I'm going to write the same because it's my work.
And I'd like to say that I'd like to me today to do my part of "because I'm going to do my part of the <unk> of the <unk> Africa of the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> to <unk> hours and <unk>.
And they were always <unk>, because the <unk> were <unk> and <unk>.
But every much, <unk>, something <unk>, and one of these <unk> artists in fact, actually <unk>.
And I know, I know know what I know, because I know you all have a <unk>, a <unk> <unk> so.
It was like if the time you know, and the <unk> <unk> through a species of <unk> and he wasn't doing anything different from <unk>, but it was <unk>.
And it's not just like a human human.
But it <unk> from <unk> and <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk>.
And when this <unk>, people <unk> what was, people <unk> what was, I <unk> it with his name.
<unk> your hands and <unk> to <unk>, "<unk>, God," God, God, "God," God. "
That's God, you know.
<unk> <unk> -- when the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> this <unk> <unk> <unk>, and their <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk>, "<unk>," <unk>, "<unk>," <unk>, "<unk>," <unk>, "<unk>," <unk>, "<unk>," <unk>, "<unk>," <unk>, "<unk>," <unk>, "<unk>," <unk>, "<unk>,
In <unk>, when a artist has done something impossible and <unk>, "<unk>," <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, "<unk>," <unk>, "<unk>, <unk> -- a <unk> <unk> of God.
And it's <unk> because we need.
But, the problem is the day after, for the <unk>, when you <unk> and <unk> that are 11 <unk> and <unk> that are the 11 of God, and <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's just a <unk> with great <unk> with <unk>, and maybe you never <unk> to <unk> that <unk> <unk>.
And maybe one one <unk> name of God, as you know, and what's going to do with the rest of his life?
It's difficult.
This is one of the most <unk> <unk> to do in a life.
But maybe it doesn't have to be so <unk> if you're going to be so <unk>, <unk>, which the <unk> of your <unk>.
But I just just just that you can get data in <unk> from a <unk> <unk> of your life that you have to go to <unk> another when you get another when you're going to <unk> that you've got to <unk> it.
And, you know, if we think in this way.
And so I started to <unk>, and it's <unk> as I've been <unk> for different months in the book that <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And that I have to <unk> when I feel <unk> to <unk> when I feel that I feel like this is, I think I'm going to be <unk>.
<unk>'t <unk>. <unk>'t just your work.
<unk> to <unk> your part, any, any of any, can be.
If your work is <unk>, <unk>.
If you have <unk>, <unk> <unk> to you <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> some kind of <unk>, to a moment through your <unk>, and your <unk>! "
<unk>, you do that same same <unk>.
And "<unk>!" <unk> to you.
I think it's <unk>.
"<unk>!" <unk> to you the same, even for the same, even for the human <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk>: <unk>!
As you know, I've already talked about some of these projects on what we can <unk> and <unk> <unk> of new <unk> of genes.
Now we're going to <unk> a new way: we started <unk> to <unk> the <unk> of that <unk> <unk> in a new <unk> of our biology, and <unk> life.
We've always tried to <unk> <unk> questions.
"<unk> is that life?" It's something that many <unk> I think we have <unk> to understand <unk> <unk>.
We've tried different <unk>, <unk> to the <unk> in terms.
We're <unk> by 20 years.
When we have <unk> the human genome is <unk> to <unk> the world of our <unk> world of the <unk> of our <unk>.
Now, we can <unk> the life, or create new life from this universe?
This is the map of a little <unk>, <unk> <unk>, which is the species from the <unk> genome between those that can <unk> in the lab.
And we tried to <unk> the genome to <unk> a <unk>.
We're able to <unk> a <unk> of genes of <unk> <unk> that are here.
But when we have a look at his <unk> map, it's <unk> to our <unk>.
<unk>, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can <unk>, one time, it's very <unk> that can bring a <unk> <unk>.
So I thought the only <unk> that the only <unk> to <unk> this <unk> <unk> to <unk> the <unk> for some of these questions.
So we started the <unk> <unk> of "we can <unk> a <unk>?"
Is the <unk> <unk> of <unk> to produce these big molecules that we never had to create before we've never been doing before?
And, in case, we can make a <unk>?
A <unk> is just a piece of <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The speed with that we're able to <unk> life is <unk> to <unk> <unk>.
Our ability to write the code, instead of the code, but it's <unk>, it's <unk>.
And our <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We've got more 15 years ago.
The process has <unk> many <unk>, with a <unk> <unk> before <unk>, <unk> <unk> the first <unk>.
But we found that <unk> of DNA is very difficult.
There are <unk> of thousands of machines at the world that <unk> <unk> <unk> of DNA, <unk> <unk> of DNA, and it's a <unk> process: the most <unk> is a <unk> process: the <unk> is a <unk> process.
So we had to develop a new <unk> to <unk> these <unk> and <unk> <unk> the <unk>.
And this was our first first <unk>, to the first <unk> of the <unk> of the genome of the genome of <unk> <unk>.
It's a little virus that we're <unk>.
We have <unk> <unk>, <unk> the <unk> of DNA <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The interesting is when we've got this piece of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and we have <unk> in the bacteria, the bacteria have <unk> to read this code and <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> are <unk> by <unk> cells, they're <unk> by cells, and they <unk> <unk> <unk>.
I've talked about the <unk> of the <unk> industry that they have <unk> this model.
They have more than you.
So, what this is a situation that software can actually build his same <unk> in a <unk> system.
But I <unk> to do the most things in big.
<unk> to build the whole <unk> of the <unk>.
I'm more <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
So we thought we thought in <unk> <unk> of the size of the <unk>, so that we can change the <unk> to understand what the <unk> are the <unk> of a <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> is <unk>, and if you <unk> information in a computer, these have to be very <unk>.
When I <unk> this genome for the first time in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We found, <unk>, 30, <unk>, if you're going to be able to work.
One of the process is <unk> <unk> 50 <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with all other <unk> of 50 <unk> <unk> to build more <unk> that <unk> together.
<unk> <unk> here.
You know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you
<unk> <unk>: we have a <unk> code <unk> <unk>: <unk>, <unk>, <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
<unk> of those <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> about 20 <unk>, and there's a <unk> <unk> of <unk> to <unk> every <unk>.
So we can use the code for words, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
What we've done in the beginning was <unk>.
Some of the fact that it wasn't <unk>.
We've been <unk> these <unk> to just <unk> with <unk> <unk>.
There are <unk> that we have <unk> them and <unk> them.
And we started <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> by five <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
In every step, we have these <unk> in <unk> so that we're <unk> to create a <unk> <unk> as you can see in a minute.
We're trying to <unk> the process.
So, this seems to <unk> the <unk> of a <unk> of a <unk> of <unk>.
When we <unk> these <unk> very <unk>, more than 100 <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, not more <unk> to the <unk>.
It's <unk> <unk> of the tools of <unk> biology.
So we've <unk> other other <unk>.
<unk> of another <unk> called <unk> <unk>, which is <unk> <unk> for <unk> DNA <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Here's a example.
This <unk>, called <unk> <unk>, it can <unk> three million <unk> of <unk>.
You can see in the <unk> <unk> like his <unk> <unk>.
In 12 -- hours is <unk> as it was before.
<unk> thousands of organisms that are able to do that.
These organisms can <unk>.
<unk> live in <unk>.
I'm sure that life life <unk> in space, and you're going to find new <unk> <unk> of water.
And he <unk> the true, the <unk> has <unk>.
This is a image of <unk> that we built these <unk>, using these <unk> <unk>, using these <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> them.
This image was not <unk> with a <unk> <unk>, but with a <unk> <unk>.
It's a <unk> so big that we can see with a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
These are <unk> that <unk> a period of about six seconds.
This is the <unk> that we've done a long time ago.
I'm more <unk> <unk> of code.
It's the most <unk> of a <unk> <unk> <unk> from the man.
It has a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
If you <unk> with a <unk> <unk> <unk>, we <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Now, how do we do it? How can we <unk>?
<unk>, <unk>, a <unk> <unk> game.
It's a little bit more <unk> when you use.
It's more simple when it's about cells as our: you can just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> another, and <unk> another, which is <unk> the <unk> of <unk>.
In <unk> <unk> <unk> is instead of <unk> <unk> in the cell, but we've <unk> that we're able to do a <unk> <unk> of a <unk> <unk> from a <unk> <unk>.
We've got a <unk> <unk> <unk> from a species.
<unk> are how they're different than men from <unk>.
We have <unk> some <unk> in the more way to decide what you can want to <unk> to <unk> that.
The <unk> has <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And when we put it in the <unk> in the <unk>, and <unk> our <unk> <unk> <unk> the new <unk> <unk>.
And I <unk> that we didn't go to the <unk>, but we tried to <unk> in there.
This is one of the <unk> of evolution.
We found that <unk> species have a second or a third <unk> <unk> from some <unk>, <unk> in a second of new <unk>, <unk> in a second of new <unk>.
So who think about evolution, like a <unk> <unk> to the time you know, it's not <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> DNA.
The <unk> that was in the cell cell.
The <unk> <unk> we have <unk> it.
It's <unk>, and it <unk> the other <unk> like <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, and it's <unk> with only the <unk> and the new <unk>.
It's <unk> <unk>.
And in a little <unk> of time, all the <unk> of a species of a species, and you get <unk> in the all of all in a new <unk>, we have <unk> in the <unk>.
All the <unk> are <unk>, <unk> are <unk>, and when you <unk> the <unk> <unk>.
Now, this might be <unk> <unk>, but we can change the DNA can change the things in a <unk>.
Now, I've already <unk> that here is not about <unk> -- but it's <unk> -- but of the <unk> of the evolution of evolution, and a half million years and a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in which is a new <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> new <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Why do what?
I think it's enough enough when we think about our <unk> <unk>.
We're going to go to six billion and a half of people to <unk> billion people in the next years.
So, to give a example: I've been <unk> in <unk>.
Now, there are three people on the planet to <unk> <unk> in <unk>; there's going to be four.
We're <unk> problems now, <unk>, water <unk> and <unk>, <unk> and <unk> for six billion and a half people.
<unk> still, <unk> it to do it for nine billion.
<unk> <unk> billion <unk>, <unk> billion <unk>, <unk> billion billion <unk> <unk>.
That means percent of <unk> million <unk>.
When we're trying to find <unk> <unk>, or any kind of process for <unk>, it will be a huge challenge.
In the most <unk> we have to <unk> all of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> by these materials that <unk> in the atmosphere.
And in the day of today, because of the world, we have a <unk> with 20 million genes, and I like that that <unk> are <unk> for the future.
The <unk> industry only <unk> <unk> about <unk> <unk>, and think about how many things are <unk>.
Our <unk> here are data from <unk> <unk> from the fact.
Now we have <unk>, because of these <unk> <unk> <unk>, able to create what we call <unk> <unk>.
We're able to build a big robot that can produce a big robot that can produce a day.
Think about these 20 million genes of genes or <unk> to <unk> the <unk> <unk> to produce <unk> or <unk>, new <unk>, we can change, and create a small team, and create more <unk>, and create more <unk> <unk>, and create more <unk> <unk>.
And it's just a <unk> <unk>.
We can have to <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
This is a <unk> of some software software <unk> that we're working working to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to <unk> and design and <unk> a <unk> of software software.
Well, we don't know how to be.
We know what they know is their code.
Now we're <unk> on the <unk> of <unk> generation.
You've seen you who <unk> <unk> from <unk> <unk> was a <unk> experiment.
We have <unk> of the second and the third generation that <unk> <unk> enough from <unk>, and the third of <unk> as the <unk> or different kinds of <unk>.
But the only way that we're working with biology can have a big impact without <unk> the <unk> food. And the <unk> would be <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that we're working working working for <unk> cells in the <unk> that we're working working working in the next generation of the next generation of <unk>.
The solar <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> is a <unk> <unk>, but in our <unk> in our <unk>.
This is a <unk> that we've <unk> in in <unk>.
<unk> in the ocean, in <unk>, <unk> <unk> feet of <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> by <unk> using <unk> <unk> <unk> of energy.
We're trying to understand if we can <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk>, that can be <unk> by <unk> <unk>, <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk>, to <unk> this process.
So, we think a little think that we could be able to be able to <unk> what the question "that the <unk> of" that's life is, "We have the whole <unk> <unk> industry.
<unk>. If you can't do that TED, where you can't you?
It's <unk> a <unk> of energy.
<unk>, we're working working working for using <unk> <unk> to create <unk> <unk>.
You saw this year with <unk> <unk>, we're always back to a year and a dollar dollar dollar in less when it's going to find the <unk>.
I think what you can change in <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Here is how the future might start to <unk>, now, the tree of evolution, <unk> the tree, <unk> evolution, <unk> the <unk>, and <unk> cells.
We're like so <unk> to <unk> people.
Our goal is to do in a way to live enough to try to try to try to try to try to try.
So, I'm going to show you, the <unk> possible, some <unk> work, some <unk> <unk> technology we have to <unk> in <unk> <unk> a year ago. This is <unk>. This is <unk>. This is <unk>. This is <unk>.
It's a environment that you can <unk> it is a local environment that you can <unk> to <unk> a huge amount of data.
So, we're seeing <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with a kind of <unk> <unk> and <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> the images like we want.
And that's not how much much of information information that we see, how much much much of data or <unk>.
Most of the <unk> <unk>, but this for example is a <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, and <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It doesn't do any difference because the only thing that <unk> <unk> the <unk> of a system like this is the number of <unk> on your <unk>.
This is a whole book, example of data, <unk> of <unk>.
This is <unk> <unk>. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
So, it's just about the <unk> and not images, we can do a thing thing about that, to see that it's about a real <unk> of the real <unk>.
It could be a way to read a little bit of <unk> to read a book.
I don't want to <unk> it.
This is a example example. It's a number of a number of the <unk>.
Every image is the beginning of a <unk>.
And it's really really <unk> to read the <unk> of the real experience of a <unk> <unk> or a <unk>, which is for nature for nature.
We also have something with the <unk> of this number in this number of the <unk>.
We've created a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. It's <unk> <unk> that you <unk> in a normal <unk> and we have <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk>.
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk>, you can see here.
Or other models, or even <unk> <unk>.
And this really <unk> some of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of space in space.
So, we have this <unk> <unk> to <unk> and other <unk> like that, not more to be <unk>.
And of course, the <unk> is one of the most <unk> of technology.
And on this doesn't want to <unk> time, if you don't want to say that we have <unk> to <unk> that we've <unk> to <unk> this <unk>.
These are all the streets in the U.S. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
So now I'm going to say else.
This is actually the <unk> in the <unk>; you can see it to see.
It's a project called <unk>, which is <unk> two different technologies.
One is <unk> and the other is a <unk> <unk> to the computer very interesting <unk> from <unk>, one of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And it's <unk> in the <unk>, <unk> from <unk>.
You can <unk> when we do this kind of <unk>, and we can go to another image to another image of experience to <unk>.
But the <unk> <unk> of images here has actually a meaning.
<unk> <unk> of the computer <unk> have these images together, and so that <unk> <unk> to places that <unk> all the <unk> of the <unk> that all <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk>. So you see that you can see the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> or <unk>, and these things are <unk> <unk>, and these are <unk> <unk> <unk>.
I don't know if I've got to show you some other environment.
There's some more <unk>.
I want to go to one of the <unk> of data <unk> <unk> <unk> and this <unk> <unk> from a <unk> <unk> that we have done for the first time to show you what it's really <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> that we're going to show you that <unk> is <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>.
We had to <unk> <unk> <unk> and on him.
This is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>. And he <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
So, so I'm <unk> by <unk> and you're all <unk> <unk> at the level in this way.
And it's possible to this way.
You know, I would never be able to work to work to work for <unk>.
It's very <unk> <unk> this kind of <unk> here.
I think you can see that it's about a lot of different kinds of <unk>: from those <unk> <unk>: from those <unk> <unk>, a <unk> number, a <unk> number, <unk>, <unk> together in this environment.
And if I can <unk>, I can try to <unk> those <unk> <unk>.
<unk> are <unk> by <unk>, <unk>.
So, the <unk> here is a series of <unk> -- <unk>.
This is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We can go from the <unk> <unk> of this environment.
The <unk> is that we can do about things with the environment. This is now <unk> data from the whole <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> as the <unk>, and we all all all of the data.
All those pictures are <unk> together, more than the <unk>.
You have a <unk> model of the the land that you have to <unk>.
Think about this as a <unk> of the work of the work of <unk> <unk> on Earth.
It's something that <unk> in the <unk> of hand that people <unk> <unk> <unk>, and the <unk> that they <unk> with the <unk>.
<unk> are <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> from other people.
If somebody is the idea of <unk> all these <unk> <unk> <unk> the name, my <unk> picture of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and I can use how to use the <unk> in that <unk>, and they have a <unk> experience, and they have a social experience.
And of course, a <unk> of all, that are <unk> <unk> <unk> of every interesting interesting <unk> of the land, <unk> not only from <unk> and <unk> <unk>, but <unk> by <unk> <unk> and <unk>, but <unk> by <unk> <unk>.
<unk>.
Chris Anderson: I've been good? What do your software <unk> <unk> us to do is that that your <unk> <unk> <unk>, in the next years,, all the <unk> of anybody in the world's <unk>?
<unk>: Yes. What is doing in fact,
It's <unk> of <unk>, if you want to, <unk>, <unk>.
And it's doing in the <unk> of images.
The thing is very interesting if you think about <unk> <unk> of information that many of these images <unk>.
As you can <unk> a <unk> of images on the Web, you have a <unk> and the <unk> on the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the images.
Now, what happens if that picture you can <unk> all your picture?
So the amount of <unk> <unk> and the amount of <unk> that we're really <unk>. It's a <unk> <unk> of the network.
CA: <unk>, it's really incredible.
<unk>: I'm very much.
One of the <unk> when you <unk> and one of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> is the way to live in the <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk> the past, the <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> think that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, or <unk> <unk> <unk>, or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> are still <unk> <unk> <unk>, or <unk> <unk> <unk>, or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, or <unk> <unk> <unk>, and the idea that the idea that the idea that we have <unk> in the idea that we have <unk> in the idea that is <unk>, but it's <unk>, but it's <unk>, but it's <unk>,
<unk> of a particular <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> that our <unk> <unk> has done, or <unk>, many <unk> <unk>.
And, of course, all of <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> all. <unk>. <unk>.
We're <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We have to <unk> the <unk> of death, so they don't <unk> <unk> if you <unk> and <unk> --
We all have a art.
What <unk> is the <unk> <unk> of the song, the <unk> of every culture.
It doesn't matter that the <unk> of the <unk>, or <unk> <unk> <unk>, or <unk> <unk> <unk>, or <unk> <unk> <unk>, or <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk>, or a <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk>.
He was my <unk> of journey in <unk> a month ago, or a month ago, or a <unk> of <unk> in <unk>, on the <unk> mother.
All of these <unk> <unk> that are other ways of <unk> to other ways of <unk> other ways of <unk>, other ways to <unk> in the world.
And if you're going to <unk> a moment, it's a moment that you can give you hope.
<unk>, <unk> <unk> of the world of the world of the world and <unk> that <unk> the planet and it's important for the <unk> of the planet like <unk>.
And you can think about this <unk> <unk> as an <unk> <unk> and you can <unk> the <unk> <unk> of all the <unk> of all the <unk> of all the <unk> of all the <unk> of the human <unk>.
<unk> is the great <unk> of humanity.
It's the <unk> of what we're and what we can be in how we can we be in how <unk> <unk>.
And <unk> <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is success.
<unk> <unk>, for example, <unk> that 50 percent of all the species is, or the <unk> of the <unk>, because it's <unk>, or -- <unk>, or -- in the <unk> <unk> <unk> -- and you don't even even even even <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> -- and you don't even even even even even <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> of all that is, of course, <unk> <unk> <unk>.
When you're <unk> <unk> <unk> on this planet.
One language is not just by a <unk> or a series of rules.
A <unk> is the <unk> of human human human human <unk>.
It's the half with which <unk> of every culture is in the world.
Every language is a <unk> of the mind, a <unk>, a <unk> thought, a <unk> of <unk>.
And of those <unk> <unk>, as we're <unk> here, at least the half the half the <unk> of children.
They're not more <unk> to children, which means, less than <unk>, <unk> that they're already <unk>.
What's more <unk> of the <unk> of being <unk> from the <unk>, to talk about the last <unk>, the last <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> of the children?
This <unk> <unk> was the <unk> of someone in some of the world's been <unk>. And every two weeks, a <unk> <unk> and <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And I know that somebody of you <unk>. "It's not better?
The world doesn't be better than if you <unk> all the same language language? "<unk>, then we're going to all <unk>.
<unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> what means to say, you can't talk about their language.
I'd like to give you a journey through the <unk> --
a little journey in <unk> to give you a <unk> of what we're <unk>.
And many of us that when I say, "different ways of <unk> <unk>." I mean, "I mean, we're really going to say," We're really really really really really <unk> different ways of us.
<unk> for example, this <unk> <unk>, <unk>, the <unk> of <unk>, which <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's a <unk> that is not able to <unk> the color of the blue <unk> because the <unk> <unk> <unk> is <unk> in the time of the <unk>, which <unk> the <unk>.
They have a <unk> language and a <unk> <unk>, "<unk> <unk> <unk>," <unk> <unk> <unk>, "You have to a person that's <unk>.
All of that has <unk> in the past, <unk> is that <unk> is that in these families in which you're going to talk about seven or seven <unk>, because of <unk> nobody language.
It's going to talk and then you can talk about.
<unk> one of the most interesting <unk> with which I've been <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, a incredible <unk> that had the first <unk> in <unk>.
In <unk> five <unk> have a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
They've done by the <unk> <unk> that <unk> them in <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk>, <unk> that this <unk> of the <unk> <unk> had never seen anything of <unk>.
They have <unk> the <unk> picture of the land, they have <unk> to <unk> a form or a <unk> and, not <unk>, they have <unk> <unk>, and they have <unk> <unk> the five <unk>.
But the <unk> don't only <unk> <unk>.
They're <unk> in their own.
<unk> percent of the <unk> <unk> was <unk> by their own.
We're <unk> to eight <unk> and we found two <unk> of death and when we've <unk> to know, they have <unk> that one of them was so that it's <unk> <unk>, and then they have <unk> the same. And then they have <unk> it.
<unk> were able to <unk> the animal from 40 <unk> from 40 <unk> and <unk> the species.
<unk> years, I was <unk> <unk> a really interesting <unk> when my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> me if I wanted to go to <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk>.
For a sense of <unk>, I would have to understand culture and that the <unk> is not <unk> <unk>.
It's pretty much of a <unk> <unk> <unk> of the world.
<unk> interesting.
If you're going to <unk> to <unk> the big <unk> of the world, what would you like to me?
<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>,
A continent is always always always <unk> out, thinking that Africa has <unk> <unk>. And instead of course, and it's not another is that the <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
What makes the interesting <unk> is the <unk> <unk> between the life and <unk> <unk>.
So, <unk> do <unk>.
<unk> can be <unk> by <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>.
So, the <unk> <unk> to say, "<unk> <unk> to talk about God.
We <unk> in <unk> and God. "
And from the moment you're <unk>, it's the spirit that you can <unk> you can <unk> <unk>?
So you know, these incredible <unk>: <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> all the <unk> with the <unk> that I've been <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
In a continent of <unk>, this <unk> never been <unk> by <unk>.
And I'm <unk> to <unk> today, but their <unk> is <unk>.
The young young <unk> are <unk> from families or four years, and they live in a world world, and they live in a world of <unk> and <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> to 18 years.
Two <unk> of nine years of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of the mother, now, <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk>.
So, so so they're <unk> to values of their own society, <unk> that they <unk> their <unk> and only their <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or to say, <unk> <unk> <unk>.
In the <unk> of this incredible <unk>, they're <unk> out and for the first time in their <unk>, at the age of 18 years,, see a moment of the first <unk>, when the <unk> <unk> <unk>, when the the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in his <unk> theory.
"<unk>? I said," <unk>?
It's <unk>. Now it's to you. "
They call <unk> more and they say that we, <unk> <unk>, we're <unk> <unk>, we're <unk> <unk>,
This level of <unk> is extremely important.
When we think of <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> history of the <unk> <unk>, which is a <unk> <unk> in his <unk> or maybe <unk> and we say that these <unk> are more <unk> to us.
<unk> <unk> are not <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> by <unk>.
There's not space to these things in <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, but because of the <unk> of the <unk>, but because of the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> <unk>, but on the <unk> <unk> <unk>, but it's <unk> <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk>: the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
What does it?
<unk> that one of the <unk> of the <unk> that the <unk> is a <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk>. And it will be a human <unk> <unk> and it's going to be a different <unk> <unk> of the <unk>, or that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And that's <unk> of one of a <unk> or a <unk> <unk> <unk> is <unk>.
What is interesting is the <unk> that <unk> the <unk> <unk> the <unk> between the natural world.
I've been <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> to be <unk>.
And that I've got a human human <unk> from my friends who believe that the <unk> are <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that live in the <unk> <unk>, and the <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of the world, <unk> that they're going to be different than my friends.
If you can <unk> that these <unk> can create different, <unk>, we start to understand some <unk> of them.
I've got this picture of <unk> in <unk> <unk>.
Maybe some of you have heard about <unk> <unk>, the most powerful <unk> <unk> <unk>.
What makes it <unk> the <unk> is not the potential to <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk>. It's <unk> from two <unk>.
So, the side, this <unk> <unk> that <unk> a series of <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, <unk>.
<unk> the only <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> a little <unk> that <unk> <unk>, but it's <unk> with the <unk> of a family <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This <unk> <unk> <unk>, very like <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
If you've ever <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> that they do a different <unk> of species, <unk> <unk>.
<unk> that <unk> on the <unk> is a little like to be <unk> by a <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a <unk> of <unk>. It doesn't make a <unk> of the fact.
<unk> <unk> with my <unk>, <unk> Richard <unk> <unk>, the man who <unk> was <unk>, with his <unk> <unk> was <unk>, with his <unk> <unk> in the <unk>.
My <unk> is not <unk> these <unk> <unk> as you can't tell these <unk> as you can't tell you to say, you can't tell you, because they're not <unk> by <unk> because they're <unk> by <unk> <unk>, because they're <unk> by <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
It's possible to <unk> if you can only <unk> with other <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Now, the good: <unk> <unk> that are <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, the same thing to <unk> <unk> <unk>, the same thing for <unk>. The question is <unk> <unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk>: <unk> in a <unk> of <unk> species, but if they do <unk> two <unk>, but if you're not like this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, but <unk> <unk>?
We use the big <unk> of <unk> and <unk>, which can <unk> <unk>.
But if you <unk> to <unk>, we're going to <unk>, "The plants."
What does it?
This <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and that <unk> <unk> in the the <unk>, and that our eyes in the same species.
If you know, they <unk> their <unk> <unk> us "<unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> of plants, the rest of plants, the rest of the <unk>, I said," No. "
The solution is: You have <unk> <unk> in a night of night and <unk> <unk> with a different <unk>.
And so, you don't have to <unk>, but it's much more interesting that <unk> <unk>.
Now, <unk> the problem is that also the problem that also have to the heart <unk> <unk> them, but they're <unk> them to the <unk> of the history of the history of the history of the history of the history of the history of the history of <unk>.
In fact, the <unk> century, <unk> <unk> for his <unk> or <unk> <unk> for his <unk> or his <unk> <unk>, but like the <unk> was in which we <unk> and we <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk>, and we <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and the <unk> of the planet. Now the <unk> of the planet. Now, it's not the the change. Now the change. Now,
All the <unk> through the <unk> have been <unk> in a <unk> to new <unk> to new <unk> to a chance of life.
And the problem is not technology.
<unk> <unk> don't have <unk> to be <unk> when they put out of <unk> and <unk> as <unk> <unk>, and they have <unk> to be <unk> when they put out and <unk>.
It's not the change or technology that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. It's the power of the power.
The <unk> <unk> of <unk>.
And if you <unk> a <unk> <unk>, you know, they're not <unk> to <unk>.
I'm <unk> and <unk> out of the <unk> <unk> out of <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> their ability to <unk>.
<unk> that <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> of <unk> --
<unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, a <unk> that has been <unk> in the the <unk> of the <unk> and now <unk> to a generation ago, and now <unk> to the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, where you can see the <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> with the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Or, in case of <unk>, are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with the <unk> of <unk>.
If you <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk>, where I'm doing a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk>.
As <unk> the <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, but <unk> <unk> <unk>, it's <unk> to <unk> level, but the <unk> <unk>, the <unk> of a <unk>, but it's not only <unk>, but <unk> <unk> in some <unk>, but <unk> <unk> in some <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the development.
And you can't understand the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> to the <unk>.
I have the <unk> miles from <unk> in China through the <unk> <unk> <unk>, but it <unk> with a young <unk>, but only <unk> to <unk> with a young <unk> that I've been <unk> in the <unk> that's <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> million people <unk> from <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The father was <unk> to the <unk> <unk>.
The that means that it was <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk>.
<unk> <unk> is <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> mother was <unk> and his <unk> was <unk>.
It was <unk> of <unk> in <unk> age of two years <unk>, because he didn't have to live without him.
The <unk>, <unk>, he did the same, it was <unk> in the <unk> of <unk>.
A day has <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> and, for this <unk>, <unk>, it was <unk> to the seven years.
The <unk> can be <unk>, but the <unk> <unk>.
And then, all it <unk> to a choice.
<unk> live in the world of the <unk> or we want to <unk> the world of the <unk> of the diversity of the <unk> of the world?
The big <unk> <unk> <unk>, before he said that his most great <unk> was that that his <unk> <unk> was that, in our <unk> <unk> of the world, not only <unk> the whole <unk> of the human <unk> of the human <unk> of the human <unk> <unk> of the human <unk> that they were <unk>.
And it's <unk> to remember that our species is <unk> for <unk> years.
The <unk> <unk>, which has <unk> us to <unk>, which has done <unk> to the <unk> <unk>, <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk>, and we talk about <unk> <unk> <unk>, and we talk about <unk>, and we talk about <unk> years ago.
The <unk> world has been <unk> <unk>.
And that <unk> <unk> me that we have the <unk> to all the challenges that we have to come in in <unk>.
When these <unk> of the world's <unk> <unk> to say what you might say to be human, <unk> with <unk> different <unk>.
And it's in these <unk> that all of the chance to be what we're: a species, that we're going to make it in that all the <unk> and all the <unk> can <unk>. And there are very very <unk> <unk>. And there are there.
I've got this picture of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, and this man, and this man, and this man, he <unk> the wonderful story of his <unk>.
The government <unk> was not always <unk> with the <unk> <unk> <unk> and in the years to <unk> our <unk>, we have <unk> them in <unk>.
The <unk> of this man <unk> <unk>.
The family, <unk> for his life, <unk> all the <unk> <unk> all of his <unk>.
We know that <unk> <unk> doesn't <unk> the <unk>, <unk> it.
The <unk> of the <unk> <unk> were <unk> in <unk> of fish in <unk>.
The <unk> of this man doesn't <unk> by night or <unk> by the night or <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's <unk> on, you know, you know, <unk> <unk> <unk> in your hand. When I did the <unk> <unk>, and <unk> in their hand.
He has <unk> <unk> on <unk> of this <unk> of <unk> and when <unk> <unk> <unk>, he <unk> a dog.
He's <unk> the dog and <unk> a <unk>, with the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk>, <unk> another <unk>, and it's <unk> on the <unk>, and it's <unk> on the <unk>, <unk> <unk> in <unk>.
<unk> to talk about anything? <unk> <unk>? <unk> <unk>. And this, in different ways, <unk> is the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and all the <unk> of the world.
<unk> <unk> the government government <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of a area of <unk> area of a <unk> area of the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> together.
It's their new <unk>. It's called <unk>.
It's a <unk> <unk>. <unk> all the <unk> resources.
One example of how a <unk> can <unk> with his <unk> <unk>.
And, to end, I think it's pretty <unk> at least who's been in these <unk> <unk>, and that they <unk> that they're not not not all all <unk>.
For somebody is home.
<unk> <unk> of the human <unk> that <unk> at the <unk> of the time. And for all, <unk> of these children, like our children, they're <unk> of the <unk> of the hope.
For, we <unk> <unk> we're <unk> that <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> never <unk>.
<unk> that <unk> --
<unk> <unk> are not <unk>, but we think the stories can change the world, and maybe we're the best <unk> to tell the best <unk> for the world.
<unk> <unk> our <unk> <unk>.
Our <unk> are <unk> by million people.
Our work is <unk> in <unk> to bring our audience in places of <unk> <unk> from <unk> that <unk> <unk> from how they have <unk> and <unk> <unk>, and they have seen <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and we have to find a <unk> world, and we have to find a world in the world of <unk> in the world, and we have to find a world of <unk> and <unk> world.
where the <unk> of all the <unk> can <unk> our <unk> <unk> can <unk> our <unk> <unk>.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some things that I've been talking about other that I hope you've heard and <unk> to <unk> some <unk>, in the case, in the case, in the <unk>, in the case, in the <unk>, in the <unk>, in the case that I've heard of <unk> that I'm going to talk about some things that I'm going to talk about some things that I've heard and I I I've've've heard heard heard heard
I want to start with what I call "<unk> <unk>."
The <unk> <unk> of what?
The <unk> <unk> of all the <unk> society <unk> <unk> <unk>: "If we want to <unk> the <unk> of our <unk> <unk>."
The reason is, from a side side, in fact that the <unk> is <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> for human beings.
<unk> else is that if we're <unk>, all of us can <unk>, all that we can <unk> our <unk> to do that that we <unk> our <unk>, without no no no no no one that we're going to be <unk> in our <unk>.
The way to <unk> the <unk> is <unk> choice.
The most choices have, more choices are <unk>, and it's their <unk>, most of the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>.
This is so <unk>, it's so <unk> <unk> in society that nobody <unk> <unk> in <unk>.
And it's also <unk> <unk> in our lives.
I'm going to show you some examples of what the <unk> is possible.
This is my <unk>. It's not very big.
I was a simple <unk> <unk> on <unk>.
In my <unk> <unk>, there are <unk>, without <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that you can buy for a huge number of <unk> <unk> that you can buy for a huge number of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Here's what <unk> is the <unk>.
Then you go to the <unk> <unk> for a <unk> <unk>: <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
And in this single <unk> <unk>, there's a big number of <unk>.
We can make six million different <unk> using the <unk> that there are in a <unk>.
<unk> <unk> that there is <unk> choice.
<unk> <unk>: The world of the <unk>.
And once, I was a child, they could <unk> all the <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> that they were <unk> by <unk> <unk>.
They <unk> the phone, you don't have it.
One of what's what the phone, the phone, it was that the phone never <unk>.
These days are <unk>.
We have a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, especially between the <unk>.
Here's the future of the future.
My <unk> is what I <unk> in a half, <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
If you have no <unk>, you've seen in the <unk> <unk>, you're going to be <unk>.
And what's going to end is that people <unk> to the <unk> and it does this question. And you know, the answer is the answer? The answer is "
It's not possible to buy a phone that doesn't <unk> things.
So, in other other other things that are much more important than the <unk> <unk>, you know, you know, the same <unk> of choices.
<unk> <unk>: <unk> in the United States that you're going to <unk> from <unk> and the <unk> you have to do.
Instead, <unk> from <unk>, and the <unk> says, "OK, we could do you know," <unk>, "<unk>," <unk>, "" "<unk> <unk>, and these <unk> <unk> and these <unk> <unk>. What you want to do?"
You know, "<unk>, what do you do?"
And the <unk> says, "<unk>, and these <unk> <unk> and these <unk> <unk>, and they <unk> these <unk> and these <unk>."
"What do you want to do?"
And you say, "<unk> if she was, what you would you say?"
And the <unk>: I'm not going to her. "
The <unk> <unk> "<unk> <unk> <unk>," <unk> that <unk> it does a big thing.
But in fact, it's not that one <unk> the weight and the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk>.
There's a huge <unk> of <unk> <unk>, <unk> people like me and you, and you, you know, if you think you don't have any sense, because we can't <unk>.
But if we can't <unk>, why do we can't <unk> them?
The answer is that they want to <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> of so much as the <unk> is our <unk> <unk>. It's a question of choice, "<unk>," We don't want to <unk> the children. "It's not more <unk>:" <unk>'t <unk> <unk>. "It's not <unk>.
And we can <unk> how many times we can <unk>.
The that means that every <unk>, you have to <unk> that kind of person to be.
<unk> the family and <unk>, a time the common <unk>, <unk> <unk>, almost almost for anyone, and they <unk> to anyone, and you can <unk> the <unk> to make your children.
The only choice was with who, when, and that we don't know what they could do after.
<unk>, all is really to play.
<unk> to students very <unk>, and they <unk> their 20 percent in less than work.
And because they're not less <unk>, because they're not less <unk>.
but why I'm <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, "<unk> <unk> or not?"
"<unk> <unk> later? I have to think before or <unk>?"
I'm <unk> <unk>.
And they're trying to <unk> these questions, even if this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> doesn't get a <unk> <unk> to my <unk>.
And they have to do that. I'm important questions.
Now, the work: we're <unk>, like <unk> <unk>, because technology technology <unk> us to work every day, every day, every day, from every day of the <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, there's a <unk>, and I don't say that nobody, where the <unk> works.
I don't say, because I want to use it.
What means, this incredible <unk> of choice that we have about the work? It's we have to <unk>, if we have to work, if we have to work or not.
We can go to our son to <unk>, with the phone in a <unk>, the <unk> in the other, and the <unk>, and the <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> on the <unk>.
And if I'm <unk> all, every minute that we see our <unk> <unk>, we're also <unk>, "I have to be <unk>,"
"" I have to <unk> this <unk>? "
And when the answer is "no," No, this makes the experience of your <unk> experience of your <unk> <unk>.
So, from any part of any look, and <unk>, and <unk> objects, and <unk> <unk>, life is a question of choices.
And once the world was this: <unk>, but it was some chance, but it was a whole thing.
The world of today today, <unk> is, "<unk> is," What is a <unk> thing, or <unk>? "
The answer is <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> them all, so we all know, so I'm going to talk about the <unk>.
So, this choice two two fact, actually, <unk> people.
The first, <unk>, it's that <unk> <unk>.
And so so we're going to do that, it's very difficult to do it.
I'm going to give you a example of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
A <unk> my <unk> has access to data of the <unk>, <unk> society <unk>, with a million <unk> <unk> <unk>, with a million <unk> <unk>.
What she found it was that for every 10, the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> of two percent.
With 50 <unk>, there's 10 percent in less than <unk> when they're just going to be able to five. Why?
Because with 50 <unk> <unk>, which is <unk> to <unk>, and the choice is <unk> to <unk>.
And at <unk>, and again, and it <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and of course, you can't ever.
<unk> that doesn't just mean that these <unk> <unk> food for <unk> <unk> <unk> for <unk> because they don't say that the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of <unk>.
<unk>'t <unk>, they're <unk> to five <unk> <unk> to the year of work, which would be <unk> to <unk>.
So the <unk> is a <unk> of <unk> to have <unk> <unk>.
And I think that <unk> the world so.
"And to end, to the <unk> <unk>, or <unk>?"
<unk> just to take the right, if it's the right, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you're going to take the right?
You don't want to have the bottom of the <unk> <unk>.
So this is the first <unk>. The first <unk> is that even if we can <unk> the <unk> and make a choice, the end of how <unk> <unk> <unk>, and we're less <unk> in the <unk> of how to <unk>.
And this for different reasons.
One of these is that with many <unk> in which you have, if you <unk> a lot of <unk>, is easy to imagine that you could do a different choice that would be better. And that's what happens is that it would be better. And that's what what happens to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>,
I also also also also, you know, they were a <unk> <unk>.
The most choices are, there's easy easy to any <unk> of any <unk> of any <unk> of <unk> choice.
<unk>, there is what the <unk> called <unk>.
Dan <unk> has <unk> very well well as the value that we call things things from what we have to <unk> things from.
<unk>, when there are many <unk> <unk>, it's easy to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> that is <unk>.
So, this is a example. I'm not about the New York.
But it's what you probably <unk>.
There's this <unk> to <unk>.
A place of <unk>.
<unk> <unk>. <unk> day. It's all to them.
<unk>'t <unk>. But that he think he says, "Well, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, is <unk>."
"All my <unk> <unk> are on my <unk>."
"<unk> <unk> <unk>."
And it's two weeks, <unk> from the idea that's <unk> -- every day -- the chance to <unk> where you want.
The <unk> <unk> for that we have, when the choice was <unk>.
And more <unk> that we have from <unk>, more <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Here's another example.
This <unk> <unk> tells us us.
It's about the time, and maybe in the live in a moment.
But the most important thing is that any thing you're going to do that.
The things that they don't have many <unk> that can make less <unk> what we do.
<unk> <unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk>.
I've tried to my skin <unk> a new couple of <unk>.
<unk> almost always <unk>.
And once the <unk> were a <unk>, and they <unk> them from <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, <unk>, just after <unk> a lot of <unk> and <unk> a lot of times, and <unk> a lot of times, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> to go to the good.
So, I <unk> a couple of new when they were <unk>, and I said, "I need a couple of <unk>, this is my <unk>."
The <unk> said, "<unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>?"
<unk> them to <unk> or <unk>? "<unk> or <unk>?" or "<unk>?"
"Do you want to <unk>?"
"<unk> them to <unk> or <unk>? <unk> <unk> <unk>.
I was <unk>, and after a little bit of <unk>, I want to say, "which was the only thing -- which was the only thing." It was the only thing that was, so for a <unk>. I've got <unk> <unk> <unk>, and then the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, I've ever ever <unk>.
It was the <unk>.
But I'm going to be <unk>.
Why? I've got a whole book for <unk>.
The reason I was that even even even even with all that choice my <unk> were <unk>, <unk> <unk> to be <unk>.
I had <unk> <unk>. I had not <unk> to me when they're going to be a kind of <unk>, but when they were <unk>, at least, at least, at least, at least, a great <unk>.
What I had <unk> was good, but not a good.
After <unk> what I <unk> <unk> with what I was <unk> in <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> of <unk> in life of people don't do that <unk> the <unk> that they have these <unk> <unk>.
And this <unk> less <unk>, even when the <unk> are good.
<unk> in the world of the <unk> if you know.
Because if you <unk>, I don't <unk> what I'm talking about.
The truth is more to this.
"It was better when he was <unk>," The reason for that you know, when he was better when he was <unk>.
<unk>, in the world we live in -- <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> that we can <unk> is that things are the <unk> that we can <unk> is that things that we can <unk> <unk>.
You've never never <unk> because your <unk>, because your <unk>, my <unk>, you're <unk>.
The <unk> of happiness -- what you're here -- is, "<unk> <unk>" <unk> "<unk>". "
I mean, small moment -- I'm really <unk> -- I'm really <unk>.
I couldn't have better, I had to me.
But I don't always always always, it's going to be a <unk> thing.
<unk>, a <unk> of your <unk> <unk> when there's just that kind of <unk> is that when you're not just that when you're not <unk>, and you say you? "
"Who is <unk>?" "" "" ""
The world is the <unk>. What I could you do I'm going to do?
When I'm hundreds of kinds of <unk>, and they <unk> a <unk> <unk>, and I <unk> you who is <unk> that the <unk> <unk>, is <unk> that the <unk> you.
I could be better.
And we have hundreds of <unk>, there are not <unk> for <unk>.
So when people do, they do, even if you have the result is <unk>, you know, you know, and they <unk> their same.
In the last years, the <unk> is <unk> in the world.
I think a <unk> <unk> -- not the only, but important -- of this <unk> <unk> is that people have been <unk> because the <unk> are too <unk>.
And when they have to <unk> this thing think that <unk> is to them.
So the end of the end is that we're better, but we're going to be better.
I think you know, you know.
This is the <unk> <unk>, what we all take for good. And it's completely <unk>. It's not true.
There's no <unk> that a little bit of choice is better than choice is that we don't have any <unk> that much choice is better than a little bit.
There's a <unk> <unk>, <unk>. I don't know what it's.
But I'm sure we've <unk> from a piece of the level of the <unk> level of our life.
Now, from the point of <unk> <unk> -- I've almost almost <unk> -- from the <unk> <unk>, <unk> is the <unk>.
What you can <unk> this choice in society is the <unk> material.
There are many places in the world, and you have <unk> <unk> <unk>, which the problem is not that <unk> choice.
The problem is that they have too <unk>.
So the <unk> I'm talking about is a <unk> <unk> of <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> society.
And that does <unk> and <unk> is this: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> you talked about how those <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk>. It's a <unk> of money. It's a <unk> of money.
I mean, these choices, <unk> and <unk>, it's not that they're just <unk>.
I'm <unk> <unk>.
They do it <unk>.
If a little bit of what in our society is <unk> <unk> choice.
This is what the <unk> called a <unk> <unk>.
A <unk> of the <unk> <unk>. I don't only like to the poor -- because of this choice in <unk> that <unk> us.
So, I said, "<unk>, you can become everything you want to --"
<unk>, people, <unk>, "But what <unk> <unk>?"
"It's <unk> that you can't make anything in a <unk> of <unk>."
"<unk>, a <unk> <unk> <unk>, a <unk> <unk> of the world --"
and I <unk> I've <unk> so, at the beginning.
But then, I <unk>, instead, I've got me that fish is the long <unk> knows.
Because the fact of the fact that if you <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk>, in the way that "you can't <unk> the <unk>." You can't <unk> the <unk>.
If you <unk> the <unk> in way that you could <unk> the <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, and <unk> the <unk>.
<unk> need a <unk>.
This is almost <unk> too much <unk>, maybe for the fish, and they <unk> for us.
But the <unk> of some <unk> <unk> is a <unk> for <unk> <unk> and, <unk>, <unk>, for <unk>.
Thank you.
