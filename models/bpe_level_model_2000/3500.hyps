And I got this one of these two billion to show the sexies that the segland that is about three million years ago for three million years ago, which is the 25 million years ago, the United States of the U....., which is 40 percent.
And this is the most of the problem of the problem of the problem of the hand.
The gygland the glevels is a sense of the clistics of the clilistic.
And the wopen and they get the writies of the women.
The next next next is going to be a very charruned to be realized the last 25 years.
The other slistened in the sket.
You see the sket, you can see the sources.
This is the write in the write of the writies of the gest.
You can see the couple of the basic five years ago, the five years ago, is the woman is that the woman of the extremremendous of the woman from the wind of the sources.
In 25 years ago is --
This is a problem because the problem of the wind of the rooms of the ocean where are extrement where are very fantantants are very connected to connect that they have been connected to the wroom of the wrows are the wrows of the round of the wind of the butts.
And I know the total of the information of the information of the global fourselves that could be realized that that could be rectly not going to be able to this is not not about this point of the same six of the same way.
And some of some of the Arkety of Arkety the wrolling of water.
The same same same Kater Water of the Universation of the Uniniversation is a very slightly a type of a type of the wind of the U..,
Wi: Al Wor: Let's say, "Like is what you're going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to the question:
A type is that this is that the Groom Groom the Groom of the Grows of the Grows from the the Grorows of the Grows.
This is a broom to me me me me me to the gar.
The first time was never seen a billion of billion billion billion billion billion billion billion
This is the Groo-Kanglerly-half of Groo-Groo-Grows
If you know how to know how to know how to do to the point of the point of the sources of the walks, where is where the sunder is where the sources.
These are the range are extremely realized.
And the other planet: The planet, the most most of the planets of the planet.
The fources the scientific scientific chart of the woman is in the woman and the games that the games of the games of a few people and the games of the gart of the garger is the connected to the conceight.
And the sources of the water of the water of the Grows of the Grow.
The Hayy-walya, the most of the most of the most of the women of the new years ago, who are the women years ago.
The 25 percent of the world's read of the water of the water of the best of the connected.
All the gawwer is the water of the water of this is the water of this sources.
The sleading is exted.
But when you get the same same same way the same way to water the water of water.
In the Siven the Siid Sized by the She was 40 percent.
The basic are in the right.
And the visions, like you know, they are very much.
The recent in the world in the world is a handsing of the recty of the reclu.
The results are the writing are the first time to a myself and the sources.
And the last 10,000 number the last 30 years ago you have been going to be recccritical sand.
This is a little bit of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the information.
If you look at the test est extremely conference.
In the last last 12 years ago we have 70 million tones of COOOne -- 25 million dollars in the ocean -- every years.
Let's take a Pack of the Pack Pack of the Packet, and the women and the other sources of the other years ago, where there is where there is where there is a billional of the ocean.
The other of the most of the global of the reality of the forestion, which is the 25 percent of a birds of buts.
The room is a problems and the broom is a broom of baway.
The StStStates are two of the most of the most of the most of the Cina.
And then they have been a lot of other kids of other basic basis.
But we are doing a change a change of realization.
These are the last year the last two years agalmost of the last year and some of the same sources.
And every one one is a lot of political political trics.
The points of the broom and they have been 250 million dollars in the last million dollars in the last year-year-room to be a buttotally is a butts.
What I imagined me me is something that I think --
And I was in Tenness, where there was a lot of billion dollars a billion of billion of chards.
He seen you seen you seen the right.
This is the second more than the most of America.
It's happened to the Nat.
The recition of a recty of the industries of brobed this.
Som: I know ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫
It's a very fast, and you have to make our economy.
She was actually actually actually the bones is more than that.
It's a totally realized and the working and they were working and they get the wind.
Al God is is in the West GGGreawer of the West West West West West West West West West West West West West West West West West Wor.
The most most most concentrate in the world's Masy Casy Coooy?
G: Don BB: She said, "All God is Greews -- North Peews -- -- not about what are about what are about what are talking about what are about what happening.
Al God is the EEurope for the Prorote of Clililization of the Prows of the Prows.
This is a story of a type.
O: ALike a CAALLike the ALer's see how the slistay of our minight.
So this is our our our own own own explace to a very much of the sources of the slight-food and connected to connectttotal connectted.
In fact, the brobbbbasic is not not him.
We have a little bit of -- it was a very good good hand.
So I don't know that the crisive of the climate change the climate change
Let me do that.
L: L: All you can talk about you -- you know, you know, you know, you know about it.
So we do a little bit in a building in a structure of the brobed how to do it is a brobe.
She see! She is a little bit of the machines of the technology of the technology of the technology of the technology of the technology of the technology of the technology.
The rest of brobed is the country and the machines of the global technology of technology of technology of technology of the technology of the technology that we see that the face.
You can take a little bit of basic technology of the technology of the broom of the broom of the technology of the technology of the technology of the broo.
Al God is the Ennnglish is a converty of the Internetworks and the problem of the most of the reality.
B: The first first is in the fact is in the economy, the economy, the recrights, the recrisis.
The reason the collect of the women is our hands of the best best broom and the best and the broom and the wroom and the flistrop of the broom of the best of the type of the best of the gol.
Now, there is a new new way to be to be to usution for us.
Reer 2: 1,555,000 of energy of the last years.
And they have to realized the next next next year, and it will help us to help the sources and help the global of global global global realization.
Freally, a recently really, the best of our problems of our problems.
Reer Shor.
Al Gor: It's the point.
G: I mean, it's a lot of the America.
One of the most of the most of the slistands of the best that the buckets that are our planet.
All of the future is the future is a new technology.
All the 2: No the most of the other people are rector of the rectypes.
By Reaser is a lot of time to be realist.
Al Gor: And you know, I said, "If you want to go to to go to to go to to the sourources.
If you can go to go to to go to the best of them to go to to go to to to go to to go to to go to to go to to to go to to go to to go to to go to you.
We have to go to to go to the type.
Thank you very much.
And they have a lot of a type of Like the Let's go to the Let.
And the point of rors to you to you get to the machine.
And the other thing that the other people that the other people don't know that there is the Hero-Here is the most experiment.
And he was realized the conditions that were expectations that the connections of the universe -- in the universe -- 600 million years of the universe of the second.
And that's just just simple of simple the recent.
This is the choice Ginine.
We have these these are these fources of the Big Bang well.
This is what I working on the AAAAAAAAAA, is 40 and a lot of 25 dollars and 22 years.
This is a imagine of ASSAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAll the write of the same time.
The first sources of the room of the machines for the first time to the first time to the first time to the first time
And this was a typed ASSSSSSSSSS.
And it is going to be extremely in the sources.
It's a image of the first first of the Grruns that he was the Let's Let, and the Hished in the Hones of the Hondddynames and the Honddype and the Hondly.
In other things, when we see the first time that this imagine that we have been going to understand that we do the maybe the wind that is a great great story.
I didn't know that this is to do you to do you can do this one of this is what someone one of the one of the wind of this is this this one of this is this this was going to be this thing.
It was going to be a lot of a lot of interesting culture.
And I was a sket, then he was a problem with the machine, I was a films -- these are the mother.
These are 13,000 dollars when the machines the machines of the wind.
Now, the next next to you have a lot of you are the mother, "Well well is not a lot of you are very much.
And then can do it because they can do it become to be very very music connected.
So, 25 percent of the 112, a perperhaps of spaces of spaces the movie of these are going to the movie that can search that can the sources that you can see that the slights.
In one of the most of the most most most of the most most of the Wignet's CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC,
So the next next next to be realized and 1,000 sources and 1,000 sources of a result of a critical sources.
This was the resulted.
Now, this is more than the most extremely think that these are about 20 years, and the most of 20 years.
They are about 50 years.
We have a lot of what we have been done that we have this thing.
We have been been been done and we have been hands.
And we are the writing of their own own best to the best of the best of the best of the wom.
And the first of the HHHHHHHHHHHHe's going to be a new new new charright.
And I can see what we have expectotally filling the game of the gasic and so we have our our own own to our first first to the first of the first thing that the first thing that the next point of the problem of the problem of the reality of the problem of the realized of the realizing that the result.
Now, of course, in a half of the world, these are the world, these are the best of the science of the science of the science of the science of the science of the future of the future.
I think the first thing that the first thing that is so that the first first of the first thing is the question of things like the HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH.
I would like to do with a lot of scientific scientific scientific connect of the first imagine, which is that the experiments, which is that the experiments of the experiments of the Michay, "Michay, Michay, the Europee."
Thank you.
I want to start to talk about you to think about what you can think about a children to be a children, and wind and wind the founds.
And what you can understand how to understand and and you can see the slisters, and you learn to learned to learn and learn and think about problems and the problems of the problems of the problems of spaces.
The problem is connected to the way to understand we understand we understand the world of the world of the world of the world of the world
So, the fastic food from the extremely of our our own own own with the games, and the connected to the connector and my own own own own of the walks, and I started the walks, when I started a name of the way of the wind of the wind of the recric resector and the rectype of the realized of the winstep of the reals, and and and the hands, and and and and and and the realizing of the resourcare are are are are the sh of the the fly --
and we are our flight our sear?
The question ion was interesting to do that we decided to be able to build the Stype Styet.
And the point of Stor is a computer computer computer in the computer and a great great totally a lot of a great total concept of a great connected.
And the point of Stor is a computer computer computer in the computer and a great great totally a lot of a great total concept of a great connected.
And you can see with the wind and you can see the wers, and you see the movie and one of the slightly and a very slightly and a very slights.
But the fast, are very much, how can be hones can simple simple simple simple fast.
The Stype are examples of a new systems of the information of information of information information.
And the women that you have been connected connecttotally the movie of the other people are going to be more than the most connecttremember of the conststates, as the explace of the explace of the examples of the examples of the international international international interview of the interviews.
I just just just a simplplply example.
This is a convertyyped to show the first time you to show the well in a totion, the same thing, if you are the other thing, if you are the other other thing, or the other other him.
These are the interact of the connecttype of the other things.
If you have a interest, you know, it's what they have been happen.
If you have been connectts, and can you can get a nice a him.
If you have been connectts, and can you can get a nice a him.
They also also also also their movie and they have been done and
We have a concept of the connections of the internation of the Internetworker of the women of the game, "Well, you know, a very example, "Oh, a very interesting --
In this case, we have three -- we have been convven as a gars of the gart of the point of the way to the well where the way to what is where you can be able to the totally butts.
And I can use them to the point of the same thing in the centry, where you can seeks.
If we have a little bit of we can be a little bit of this.
There is also also also possible to be able to be able to the totally realized the wind of the women where people are are to see the people are to see the things and you can see the things that you can see the extremely things that the extremely extremely exted.
And I'm going to be --
This is a charge of Fonbonbond with a lot of efources.
And we have a lot of words that is that that is that the Sewwerge.
And this is very slight a type of Stototally a Stype of the Stype of the wind of the Stype and then then the Stype of the hands of a totion.
And then after about 30 second and I would be a new new and a new new cruns of the slight and it can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to a new things.
Thank you.
And this is the MMy MMMMMMy Let's have been a way that I was a lot of the way and I was a well of the wod.
They have a lot of a lot of a lot of it.
And one of the things of this is that is not that it's not going to give you a lot of people in people to a lot of people in people in many people in the other people that is not about this thing.
I just just just said, "Well, I said, "Woley, and they do they do what they do do do what they do do do that.
That's what people are going to be done that they well.
This is the most of the water of the most of the swwell on the wom.
It was just just just just just to be exted.
They just just just just to be for me.
Now, this is a lot of a type of a connectted.
We have build one of the point of the Ludddone of Luuuur Luuu's g.
It was going to get the other people, the She was a hands of the Stotally realized.
It was going to get the other people, the She was a hands of the Stotally realized.
It is not going to be us.
H: The proble:
Do Mery Mer: One is a hand.
H: The ide:
Bo!
So he went to the Stold and then you can get the building can make the people can be able to the people --
B: Y: Yeah!
And I was recovered the story.
H: Hay!
DD: It's a story with a person can decided and can make how to do you get how to do you want to do how to do it.
DD: It's a story with a person can decided and can make how to do you get how to do you want to do how to do it.
G: G: I want to be a game.
DD: The last last example, I show you you you you to you a lot of recently for the recently, and realizing and well and you have to be very musi.
And one of a recently recently for the butes and recovered and wind to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be rected.
The gasic is going to be as a basic and the butted.
One of these four four four four sevariariation and you can do what you can do you get what you can do you get it.
And then then you can go to the four characters to a lot of the four hand.
And a simply simply simple of a very simple of "And a total cho."
These are the most of the point of the mother, how you can see the mother.
I have a lot of a very totally reals, and then you get it.
And then then then the most effects as you have been a connected to the interness of the interactly expected.
And we look like this.
M: DD: DD: I put a type and the Sttype of the gasic system, the women, the other other people.
And he was a brobe.
M: D: DDo the rest of the type --
And I said, "M: DD: I will be the wind of the but, so I can be a lot of the way of the well of the mach.
M: D: D: I was going to be explace the international one one of a time time on the one one of the one of the other.
And the M: D: I going to be the mother.
M: D: D: I said, "M: I want to read the point of what I want to read the s."
So I don't don't have a first first first first of the first first first time to realized the more than the most more than the most more than the more than the most of the most game of the most game of the first game is a more than the most gar.
And I can see, I can seen the connected to the connected to the She set of the She said, "Sut."
Thank you.
So, you can see my own own own is going to build this is a coo-wind well as the brain is what our brain and the brain.
And I was going to show you a time of the result of this rector that you can see some of a lot of hand.
The concluding is that you want to be that is that this new new technology of this new technology for the connected with the information of the information of the information of our information in our information in our information in our information of the information of the information of the information of the information of
Thank you very much.
I can talk about what I can talk about you to you all the you.
There's a lot of drop.
She relilililight my explace is the most of this is the most of this.
It's also also the ames and my life.
And I don't know that that that it can change it.
But he said, "I said, this is going to be recently in my own own own in my own own own own in my own own own own own and I was going to work with this kind of work.
The one thing is that I realized this is that I was a very choice called "A, Pana, Panan, A, the Act."
And the result is that the one is that people were going to be as a hands like if you have been done of the people who were well.
To -- I know -- conception.
And they have to be all all the pones and I don't know and I don't know what you don't have to do you to do you do you do what you do do that?
You don't have to get to read the way to be to be to be able to be able to be able to create a lot of create that you can make someone one that you can make someone that you can be a lot of the most important that you can't realiz?"
What is that you can see somebody in somebody are
It's very fantantantant.
But could be going to be able to the first time that I started to the last 20 years ago, when I started to say -- I was a holder -- I was a type -- I was a type of the hand.
And I was instead of the same bawind of the same bawind.
And people who said, "I don't know what you don't have to have to have to have happen?
You don't know that that that that the birds of the right?
I don't know that that to do this myself to do that the things that is that the things that was going to be a mulular of a mulular of a hand-handsing with the best of the by?
And this is what you know that.
The point -- the answer -- this is all these question: "She said, "She said, "She said, "She said, "She said, ""She said, ""She said, """""""She say."
I have been been going to all of all all of all of all things.
I was always always always been to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
And I also also also also people that don't know that people would have to be able to do.
And the other things and other things and other things like that.
My how I was going to think about what I thought I thought and I thought I thought about why I was really really really really really really in why is why why do do it is why why I was going to think about what I was going to think about what I was going to think about what I was going to do it
It's about what is it?
It's a game that is that you can be expectly to be a lot of a lot of a lot of what you do do to do for it.
But what is that is that this is going to be able to be able to be able to you know, you know, the sources of the other other people that is not a way of other work?
What I mean, for exexexexample, a nice was a horder and it doesn't be a time in the first time in the first of the time, in that the expectype of the explace of the explace of the examples of the examples of the expecty?
And it wasn't -- this is that he never seeing -- how how you do you do you know how you do you do you know, how you don't know how to do you know, how you don't know how to you didn't know how to you can't know how to you know,
It was not going to be able thing?
One of course, the fasterers, like the group, the results, the research of the research of the realistic research of the resesects.
We have been total fast, and this recently, and not just just just a lot of technology and we have a lot of every every every single of the rest of the recently extremely recently realized the recently recently recently extremely results.
And not the other thing to look at the types of the most of the magnized that the magnized that the extremely extremely extremely and they have the four and they don't know and they have the squared.
And that the only only that they don't have been done to be realized to be research.
No God first first of the last last year, but in the last fact of my last year, "One of my own own own own hype of the wod."
But we don't know when we think about what we know that these things we know that these things that we have a lot of the way we have a lot of connected to the crecreation of the create and the connection of the connection of the connection of the connection, and the connected to the connected to the connection of the connection, and the connection.
And the question ion ion ion ion is that you want to all the question of this ide?
It is that this is -- because it looked like a centimetimetic books to me to me me to me to this is a very very charry.
I think it's a hold.
And I think it's also also not to see the person perhaps the person to be in the fast.
I think it's a lot of the fact of our own own own own own create and create the connected.
And I really really really really in my hands -- my move -- it would be be very very quickly to the realized that the realized of the rest of the realized in the realized and the realized of the reality.
Of -- this is -- but look at the well.
I have about about about about about about me.
And it's very very very quickly that is going to be able to be able to be able to be able to the world that the world that the world that was going to be about the last years.
It is that we know because we are all the most of the most of the most of my mother is that the most thing is the most of the most of the sources.
Oh, God is the werer!
You want this is the genome that I was going to start to get a personal personal perhaps in the basic and I want to do that.
I would really really really really to do this thing.
So, the question question?
And I read the best of the works, which the way to work to work to work to do a connect of what you can create a connection?
I was going to be a lot of realized to me, I mean, and my own own own and my own own hopen what is what is what is to be going to be to be to be able to be able to do it for the source of the well as you can see how to look at the other thing, and I was going to see the other thing, and you can see the idea of the idea of the ideas as as as a handand-hand-hard of the ideas as as as as a lot of the hopeck of the problem, and and and and I was going to see that that that that that that that that is
how to help people have to help the gesters, the result of the create of create the create of create create the creature.
And that was going to be realized to the Greews and Roox.
Seeeass because they have been in and then then he said, and then he said, "And then he said, "And then he said,
In the Grererety and Romic Romic Romic and people don't have to realized the other people who are in the other people in the other people in the other people are in the other people who have to the face.
It was thinking about this connected to this is about this points and the wind that you know a few people who know a few people and connecttremember and connecttops and connectted.
The recttypes of the recritional rect."
Someas, I would have a lot of course, a myself of a mype of the walks.
The same were the same idea, but they were called "The same ideas a lot of recluding a gen.
The is the same thing because Romans were not think that I think a lot of one one one thing that one is a very different different different thing.
And they know that this is a lot of this kind of the beautiful connected in the wind of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit like a little bit like a little bit like the first of the gas, and the rest of the rest of the recent of the result of the rest of the works.
And the results, that's the point of what is the total of what is that the patterns of the wopen and the recty of the work.
And all the woman that was so that it was work?
So the stay were tots of the hands of things, like to explace for explace of thing?
If the first first first was not a lot of course, you could not have the other thing, and all the other people who have been help that the wind of this genes.
If the rororoom of the by?
All ll right.
And so people have a concept of the creative creature for a lot of a lot of time.
And the Riash of the first and then we change, and this idea, and this ideas we have the universe of the universe of the universe and the universe and the most of the universe and you can seven the seeing of the most of the most of the universe of the universe of the the universe that they can be the universe of the the the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe and the the the the universe of
This is the human exexexexexexexexextional and people to think about the idea of the creature of the creature of the realized of the human human beyound.
And the first time in the first time you know, what is that this is that this is that this is a lot of one of a person is a person that is a one of one of one of the genom.
And I was a bely, I think was a very much.
I think about one person to be a simply of create as a simple of a recent as the wind of all of all people of all the other people and the other people in the other people and the other connection, and the other connection, and the most of the human beginning of the human human begone of the human begame of the human him.
It's like to do somebody to somebody to somebody to do the sourney.
And the rest of the rest and create all these and create all these extremely extremely experiment.
And I think this was this expression of the building in the last 500 years.
And this is this is that I think that I think that the question, and you know, and what the question?
What we do we do it is that we do it is you do this.
And you can get a lot of the most most of human human beautiful human human human human beautiful recently rectly rectly rects.
One of course, if you do that.
And if we can not have 500 years ago I was a total realized a 15 minutes.
And there is there there there are the people who would be that would be a choice that would be a scientific scientific charth, the butting people who are about the saving people are in the saves of the skilling of their games of the best of the fish of their own own own own fects.
It probably not not not going to tell you all this thing.
But the question ion ion that I want to do -- because it is -- because it is -- because it is -- because it is --
Why don't think about this momo?
Because more than the other thing thing that is that he never seen to record to experiments to read the process.
A type as a horder -- you know, it's going to do something about -- all of this is -- all of all -- it's not going to be realization.
And in fact, can be a lot of seeing hormyself course,
I realize this is with the first time with the same time with the same time that 90 years, which is that 90 years, which was a first for the same time, which was a few years and he said, "The first first first of the She was working in the first of the first first first of the wind of the wind of the wind of the winnice of the hand.
I know how he was like a basic sources.
And he was going to be the sands of the country.
I would set me to go to the type the type the type.
He would have a lot of what is to do that is to do and he said, "I said, "I said, "I can go to a myself a my."
And he was going to be and he was in the wind of this expecty, and it would be able to be a lot of butting a butting and a lot of a butty and the wind and the wererero-hand.
And I would not be a very quickly to be very quickly so it was so much and it was to go to to to to go to to to the well and the wotype and the woman and the wind and the wind of the wroten to the extty."
And then then the people were -- this is not a hands: I never never set -- there were the other people in that was going to be quite perperhaps of the wod?
So, he was going to be and he was going to be able to be the best and the wind and he was a type in the woman was in the woman that he was as if he was as if you was as if you wind the well and then the wind and the wind and then he was the wind of the wind and then he was the other hand.
He was the experiments was the extremely of his saving and he was going to be a type and he was a hand.
And in these guys would be the experiments that it was the wind and the last year, but in the last last year.
And when I think the experiments -- it's experiment, is exactly the process.
I don't know my connecttype -- I don't have a concept of the concept of the process.
I'm a muly, and my working working about the same thing is to do you know, the same day and the same day and go and go and go and go and go and go and go to to work on and and we have to work on the same things.
But I wind my head, in my head, I was going to the thing, and I would set the things.
And imagine, many of you know, the one of you know,
You know, if you look and the ideas and I would be a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a well well well of it.
And what this is this thing?
And how we can make us to do it not to do it in the head, the way we do it in the head, and we do you do you to do you do you do?
For I look at the most example, example, I was the music that I was the Tom Wathaththet's been a different years ago of the first time that I was a different day.
We talking about this point and you know that the most of the most of the first first of the fact of the wind of the wind of the realized of the information of these connection, and the instep of these create connection.
But then then he said, "I was going to be a day, and a day was going to be on on the Let's Let's see that the Let's changes for the woket.
He was going to be able and all the slight of this little bit of a little bit of flolock of his head, and the experiments, and the him, and it is and the wind and you know, it's not the wind of the well, and you know, and you know, not know and you know, and you know, not know how to know and you know, and you know, it's not know that that that the wind of the woold.
It doesn't not a lot of charth, it doesn't have a realized clu.
So I started to the next kind of a kind of a kind of a lot of what the time, and he said, "I would be realized to the experimented this is this this is this kind of this this is a recently person to this kind of a recttype and the result of the women of this kind of a rects.
I don't know I don't have to do and I don't do it to do that.
And the point of the pype of the but.
I can be a connecttten and something that this new new thing.
I just just just just simple the telecty, "Sush us, I don't know that that is not going to be going to see that that is not going ?"
"I can seems that you can see a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a clu.
If you want to existion, you can seen you know, I can seen me to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get a moment.
One of my own own own to someone one of something.
I went to burbing Leononon."
And he was working king about this.
I don't know the working was going to be like that.
But the process, and the fish is that the wind was going to be when the wind when the women of the problems that the problems of the problems of the problems of the problems of the problems of the problems of the problems of the realized that I was not going to be a realized in the recentized that the hyself is that the the realized that the wwwell, and he was not going to be that the the wind of the sources of the same thing, and
And this is that this is going to be very much, and a connection of a connection of a connection and this is that this is not going to be in the Eom.
And I think that is that the way to change that it was a little bit of working and I was going to be a type.
This is a few years ago, when I was going to be able to be "A, A, and "All of these these these these are in the perperhaps of the other of the writing in the other thing we have been working about what we had to think about what we have a lot of the write of the write that I was going to be a few than the write of the han.
It is not just the game of the gar.
And I started to think about this kind of learn this extremely explace of what I started to think about this point
But then I read the Tom of the Tom and we have to the sources.
So I do my my own in my own own in the write and I would be a himes of my hand.
And then you know what you know if we know what if we know if we know if we know if we know if we know that if we know that if we know that that if we know what's going to be not going to be be able to the polly?
Because as I can do that I do you can see what I don't know that this is not more than that.
So if you want to be the most of the point and you do it and you can do it to do it.
But if you don't know that the one thing, I don't know what it is not a hand.
I'm going to be a little bit because this is the same thing is my work.
And I would like to do that that was that I was realized my own -- I do my own -- it's the hopen -- it's all the one of the first thing -- and the North of the North of the North of the North of the women and the walk-women and they were going to be able to be able to do and the walkay, and the wer of the walken of the walth.
And they were always always buts because they were well because they were fantantantants.
But every tot, and a lot of these are going to be able and one of these basic become to the slightly exttremely extted.
And I know what what happen, because you know that that you know that you know that you know that a person of thing, a perperhap.
And the time you know, the time and the best and the best burbed if you have a kind of different cities and it was a different different different different than the first first of different different as the first first first of different seared.
And the expectremember as human human human human human human human human human human human human human hand.
But it was going to be the best and the wind of the wind of the information of information.
And when you know what you happen, you know, the people who know what they know what they know what the women was a hand.
They were gah, they started and they started to the women and "Oh, I said, "Oh, I was Dah, "Dah, "I w."
That's the Get's Get.
And I was a read of the MMans -- the She was the She was in the She was in the She was in their own own and he changes the women in the fact of the Shohype "Oh, "Oh, you know, you know, you know, you can see the Shhhydriright."
In the point of a beype of something that we can be able and "Oh, I said, "Oh, I said, "Oh, I wwell, you know, it's a very winstep -- a but, and a horder --
And it's a lot of why we have to know about it.
My problem the problem day for the best best -- when you see the wind and the woman that is 11111, and the 11111, and there's no one of the first first of the first first day.
It's just a very simple with the room of the room of the women to the most of that we never set that it would never sex.
And if you do the reason the Do I do in Do as I do it in the read of his life?
It's very much.
This is a relililistations of the most results of life.
But if you don't know about the way to be so scientists and if you can't set and you know, the most extremremember of your himes of your hands of you have the most of you have to be the other things.
But I have a simple of simple in the him, a imaginy of this imagining of the sequite of your life, and then you have to tell you you you a few years ago.
And if you know if we know in this way we know that this is the way we know that this is the way we know that this is the way we know this thing.
And I started to think about the wind and I started to think about the found that the found of the working of the working of the works, the woman that the woks, the wooman was the wind of my own own own of my own own own own own of my work.
And what I think I think about when I was going to be a him.
It is not just the F.
And the recty of the way to the way that you can see that it can see it seee.
If the roroom is be.
If you get a lot of course, I said, "If I decided to do you go to a few thing, and a few thing, and a few years ago, and then you get a few years ago, "Oh, "Oh, "Oky."
She said, "The same same same is the same be.
And "One is it to the hy."
I think I think I think I think about it.
"One of the ho" -- not just for just for the leading and they would be going to do the sands of the wind of the sand.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Joh: Haho: Wah!
And you know, I know about some of these projects of these human human beautiful thing to the human experiments and the experiments of the genes.
We started a new new new new todays, we started to start to start to the gital technology and then we have to the women that we are in a new crype of a new stand the crunning of the garth.
We got to get to the question of the questions.
"What is something that many of the life that are that I think about the way that I think about the sources.
We have different different appears of the totally realized the terms.
We have gitselves on the last two years ago.
When we have been the genomomic genome of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world.
What we can do we can read the life, you can create this new life in this unigaly?
This is the map of a little little little little bit of a little bit of the Mype of the genomic genomic genomic genomic genomic genomic that can be in the gart that you can see the sources.
And we have to realized to the genomic genom.
We have about 500 mind of the genes of genes of genes of the genes that are about 500 dollars.
But when when when you look at the map of the map of the maybe it's a simply and simply rected.
Creally, this is simple simple simple
But when we look at all the genes that we can see the way to the way to the way that you can see that the climate that you can see a clum.
So we decided that we decided that we decided to be very squetic mocrockets to the way to be able to the compones of these questions of these questions and these questions are the questions of these questions.
And we started the working on the Pathetic Peetrom to a rocty?"
What we have been connected to connected to the most of these are not that we never never set that we never se?
And in the case we can do a lot of work?
A very simple is simple a simple of the tototal total chooots.
And we are going to be able to be able to be able to the create life is going to be a lot of the expectonton.
The point of the points of the genetic well well and recovered and recorner is more than the other hand.
And our recently, the recently realized the sources.
We started 15 years ago.
The realized many people in many of a recty with a recty first first of the first first first experiments.
But we have been a cognetic DNA is very very very much.
There are the most of the world of the world of the world that the world that the world are game of the DA,
We had developed a new new new -- I had to be able to be able to the rest of these realized and the realizing of the realized of the realized to be able to be able to be able to developing these red.
And this is the first first time in the first totally realizing of the information of the Phhh.
It's a little little bit that little bit of buts.
We have been found the results of the results of the results and the result of DA cover.
The interesting interesting is when we have this point of the patic choice and we have been in the butes of the butes of this wind and this is this wind and the other cities and the other other cities and the crips of the cities of the cities.
The world are the world are the crisis of the food of the fetic and they are wind and the Europears.
I talk about a lot of recent with the industrial of the ground of the connecttly that they know this is a very much.
They are the most of you to you know that.
We see this is a situation in which is a type can build the same same well in a system.
But we have to do things in the most more than the most more than the most of things we have to do the most of things we have to do things in the most of things
We have build the interction of the interction of the but.
They're more than 80 of the gamet.
So we have been going to build the cclimbing of the climate of the cities of the climate of the sources of a compones of the cities of the clusions of the clistones.
And the providation is to start with information with information and information in a computers are very very different to be very very much to be very very very different less of these cruger is a very much.
When we have been this is a genomome for the first time in 199, the first first of a bathy for every 10 years.
We have been realized 30 horder to realized that we have been going to be able to be able to be able to do it in the next next to do it in the work.
One of the process is to be able to be about 50 50 50 50 50 50 million people who can be able to be able to the other other other care in the other other sources of the most of the most most of the most most of the working on the most of the most of the most of the bones of the other sources.
We have a lot of emergs.
And you know, we know that that we have the but.
And the most thing: we have a type of the bathetic four four four and the Wor, and T.
And the those of the slightly found about 20 minutes about 20 minutes and there's one of the specificial fources of the amount of the samazing of the samound.
So we can use the coo-took for a lot of slistay,
What we have been been in the word was going to do that.
Some are the sket.
We have been able to be simply for simply to be very simply with it.
There are expectypes and they have a very simple of us.
And we started to start to the most of the most of the most of the figaway to the figure out of the way to the way to the way to the way to the most of the 25 of the 25 of the time, to the first time to the 12 of the wind of the wind of the 12 of the way to the next next years.
And every day, every protect these gases in the games of the sources that we are going to create a lot of create a creature of a rectotally resected.
We have been trying to get the process.
And this is that seems to the type of a type of a bype of a bype of a byes.
When we are going to these seen well, the most more than 30 bbest than the best of the most people in the Everyyes.
It is going to be to be to be a lot of biological moder.
So we have been him.
We have a few other other clummed by the bombbbbasic biology, which is to be to the DA for DNA in DNA in the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of a cities.
Here's a example.
This is called Dewind Deewing for the roos can ses that can frather three million of the birds of the room of the right.
You can see in the hands of his handroom and he was going to be a crows to the building.
In 12 -- 2, 22, the rest of the first first first --
They are more than than than four money that I do this.
These organisms can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able thing.
And I can be going to be going to be going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do.
I think about the life existed that the existed of space, and they find the new new new and the other people in the water of water of water water of water.
ASSA is the NASSSSA has been this is that this is that this is that this is that this is that this is that this is the NASSA
This is a little bit of a lot of the building that we build these simple are simple with the connected with the connected with the connected of the connected of the connect of the connection.
The gaxy-hods.
This imagine is not a micrope with a microps with a microm with a microp of a fast.
It's a very very much.
These are the best couple of about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about
This is the connection.
They're more than 80 to the game of the genetic genetic genet.
It's the most of a great great great connected to the building.
It is a lot of a lot of billion --
If we have a lot of a lot of charch to be able to be 12 years ago, you have a lot of charthetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic well with a coup.
Now, how do we do you do how we do we do do that?
Of course, course, a little bit of course, is a little bit of course,
It's a little bit more than when you do it was extremely expution.
It's more than simple when you have a lot of the food of the resector how you can see the simple of the room and a hard of the innuclear of the process of the process of the process of the process of the innucation of the point.
And I was going to be a crocketrom is a lot of charth, but we have been a lot of the fastic food that we have to do a lot of a clilistay of a crisic half of a crist.
We can be a rocketrocle of a kind of a crows of a crows.
The two two two two two day.
We have a few few and more than a way that could decided to do that you can make this room for this room room.
And then it was a sciences in the way in the way to all the protectiny.
And when we have the found in the crights, and we have been the found our hand-hod-hopen -- the room -- the room is the faster of the cities.
And I started thinking about that we could go to go to the type -- but we have a lot more than the most of the most of the most of the sources.
This is one of the most most existionionion.
We have been a lot of a lot of a second second a second brocketroom to a lot of one of a lot of the other side of the sand---second totally kind of the species.
So, what I think about how to think about how you have a gence of the way that you don't understand the one of the biology.
They are the point of the realists of the realition is that the realism.
The room is the food.
The cro-----hand-ho-ho-h-hand-ho-h-hand.
It's expectype and the other ccrocketic rocketic crows and we have been just with the critics and we have just just the flistrop and the flistrop and the broroction of the room of the broom of the brocks.
It was going to be a lot of genes that we have been done of the genes that we have been going to be be.
And in a best of years ago, all the same carbon the buttotally connect of the whole thing in a new species of the special species on the new new new new that we have to be the found in the fastic fectly in a new new new new that we have been done of the buly.
All the protect are the member, and when we changed the women and when we have the woman that we have to tell you what we have to tell you what we have to tell you what we have to tell you that we have a lot of the right.
Now, this could be seems to go to the DA food and the DNA food of the DA lot of things that we can change things in the things we can change things that we can change things that we can change the right right right right now.
Now, I was going to be that that is not the other of the genome -- but in the other years of years of years of years ago, and I know that if we have been a lot of the experiments, and I know if we have a new new new recttype of the game of this is a very species of this kind of this kind of the gaxy-year----year--year-----year-----year---year-------------year
Why do you do it to do it is?
I think it's really really really explace when we think about our our own own own own exactly explace in our own own own own own life.
We have to go to to five to the four of people in the next years.
Guuur for example, I was in 1966.
And there are three people on the planet, for for a national 1960s, in 1960 years.
And we were going to be able problems to be basic problems and well and well and bals, and basic for billion of people in the other people.
It is not going to do it for it.
We are going to be more than 30 billion of best 30 billion billion billion of diold.
It means a few million million million million day.
When we have to find a lot of processs, you know, the kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of connectarch a sand.
In the most of the most of all of all the first of the world.
And the day day day and the most of the most scientific scientific connected with a few million million million million million million dollars, and I think about about about about about about about about about about about the future.
The read of the electrony is just just a lot of compones about a different different things that are different different things that are different different different different things are about things about things that are different different different things.
And our own own modle of the most most of our imagination.
We have the point of these basic and these are of slistaype of setic technologies that we can create what we have a genomic of the genomic bind.
We have to build a lot of building a lot of a billion that can be a billion of the day.
And you think about these two million million million million million million dollars to be able to make a lot of different aptototally to do it to do the wind of the new new that we can change the found and a little bit of the last years, and a lot of the last two years ago of the last two years ago.
And it's simple a simple of the right.
We can be going to be to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be fantantant, and the crisis.
This is a lot of some of some of some of some of some charch that we're working to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
Well, we know that we know how to be like this.
We have extremely their hand.
We are we are concentrate the butes of the generation of the generation.
You seen you seen you seen the anthetic from the source.
We have been found and the second and the realization of the way that would be realized to be a lot of food of the most of the most of the buttotal of the buttototal of bute.
But the way we have a way to have a lot of the most of the most of the most of the women of the balf of the burgs of the next next next to be able to be able to the COOOO2 2 in the first first of the first first time to be able to be able to be about the way to be able to be about about the point of the first time of the first time and we can be about about the first time to be about the next to be about the first of the first of the way to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be about about about 12 sixxyyyoungarright?
The COOOOne is a COOOne is a little bit -- but we have been in our world, we have been different in the world's different different in different different different different in different totally different different in the world's different hind with the COOO.
This is a lot of the room we have in 1999.
They have 200 to 200 times about 200 dollars of the percent.
And the rest of COOOne of a lot of energy like a lot of energy.
And we can understand if we can understand if we can understand the COOOO, that can be very slight to the connect that this is to the COOOOOOOOOOne of this is to this process.
So what we can be able to be in the question of the question of what the questions that the questions that the question is that the question of the idea of the questions, we have the point of the first first point of the interrible of the interrible of the interactly exttremely realization of the international realization of the questions.
And you can do it not to do it to do it to TED, where you can do you do you can do you do you do you can do you do this.
It would would would be a cool of of energy.
And in the point we're working for the next next to create create to create create create to create create create to create create it.
You seen you seen with the fluding of the planet, we had a lot of a best when you get a lot of the way to be in the water of the water of the water.
I think what you can change it can change the building that they build the wind of it.
And how could we have to be going to change to change it to change the future of the evolution of the evolution of the evolution of the butions, and the wind of the digases and the most of the recently, and the rest of the future.
We have a lot of people to be able to the people are going to be able to be able to be able to be able to the other people.
And our own is to do to do to do it for a lot of sources to do it to do it to do you to do you.
And this is going to do you can see the most most extremely ely ely expect of the new technology, we have to the Microrom in the Microrom in the water of the Siish.
It's a read that you can see that the interview is a recty with a faster of a fastenority of ddata with a vidence that is a visic sources.
So we're going to see a lot of gyype with a kind of gity-hom with a kind of a lot of a lot of a lot of seems like a little bit like you want to imagine, as you want to do how you can you want to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to a kind of a kind of a
And not important as the most of information of information information as you see how how much much of these are all these images of these imagines.
The most of the most of the most of the gathization, but this is a protect of the Biizes of the Biizes of the Siiished in the games of 300 of 300 of the gasic gelectrics of the gelectrics of the gasic of the realth.
It's not a difference because the thing is that the realization of a numbers of a number of the number of your life, in your life, and we have a very very interested in the architecture.
This is a light exexexexexamples of imagine.
This is Cashhydle Den.
So I want to show you that is that is not about and you can do you can do a little bit of the general thing that can see a realization of a recently realization of a recently not a realization of a realization of a rectotion.
It could be a little bit bit of a little bit of a little bit of a clip.
It doesn't have to be it.
This is a more example, it's a number of Guuuuure.
And I means a big story is the beginning of a cution.
And you want to show you the experience and the slightly experience the rest of a rector a crisive of a crisic of a kind of a lot of course, and a very very simple of a very very very very simple of a lot of a very very very very simply of a relightly resultor the results of a very very very very
We have a lot of this number of this numbers in the Gar.
We have a lot of a lot of holds, and it was a more -- it's more -- it's more -- a little bit more than a mype -- and you have to tell you you you you have been in the texttremely extremely tremely reduced by the wind of the wind of the tttotion.
If you can see the buts of this is that this is the womo-him, you can see it.
One of other side the species that are very species of the species.
And this is really going to show some of these ideas for these ideas to be slight on the source.
We know this is that this means to the basic and other hands and other billion is not to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the the
In fact, the map is a lot of the most of the most of technology.
And this is not to say if we don't know if we know that we know that we know that that we have to be able to this thing.
These are all the U.SSSSSSSSSSAssh of the NASAASA.
And then we are going to be able things.
This is a very effectively of the bawwell, you can see it it into the water.
It's a project of a project called Phyype Physket.
One is Sebon the other is a very very interesting in the world is a very interesting thing in Seey, one of the Universation of the Universation of the Shytype of Seeery of Seeeery of Seeevidence of Seeeefy of Seeerery of Seeeech.
And it's one on the best of Sewerers.
You can see when we can do this kind of the kind of the imagine, we can have a imagines of the other experience of the other experience of the last monthy.
But the connection of the imagine of the imagine of the imagine of the imagine of the concept of the conception.
And the galathorital connected to the world are the connected these images that are the way to realized that the realized -- all the imagines -- all the type of the Mones of the Mones of the Mones of the Moneer and the gasic -- and the wind of the things that are the hand-hand-hands of the women things that are are the games of the games of the walaily of the the games of the world and and and and and and and and the ggames of the gggaawininind of the games are are are are are are are are are are are realawomen and and and and and and
I mean, I mean, I mean.
and I was very much more than the space of the space.
I want to get a lot of the slistay-dle of the Ahhhydle is a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of Poype of the first first time to the first time -- the first time to the first -- and the first thing that is not the technology, and it is that the technology, and this technology is that we have no technology is not the technology.

And if you look at the most of the most of the most of the most of the other hand.
My are a lot of cclimb.
And in the one of the way of a very very good and hor.
This is a lot of No Dres Dres of the rectted.
We can go to the way of the slightly realization of this is this vironment.
The point is that we can do with things with things that we can do this is what we learned in the connect -- the connect of the collect of the wind of the wind of the wind -- and the wind -- and the well of the wind of the other things that we can do with the things that that all the other things that we can do that the the the the the the wind of the other things that we have been been the the connectiontions of the connection.
All the best of the other of the most of the most of the most of the rest of the fact.
You can see a model of the interest of the interner of the intern.
And you think about how to the protect of Sawer Lawwer on the Terwwer's Earth.
It's something that is something that the people who are explace that people are going to get the people and the people who are in the extremremember with the realized with the information.

If one one is the idea of connect that these connect of the room of the room of the Soky-food of the No of the first of all the sources of all of all the games of all of all of the reals, and the him, and you can have a clummmmype of the hands of the hand-hard of the wook-hyd-himes of the hand-hands of the sand-half of the resect-hol of the sh of the resources of the ssources of the garm, and and and and and and and and and and and and and and rector
In fact, a connect of what are the movies of the world are the world of the connecttotally interesting in the most interesting of the most interesting and I don't have a tototally concept of the grows of the game of the wome of the collects.
My and much.
Well you know, I think about what I understand what the reason the room is the food is a he's going to do is a hand-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-too well, in the world that the wind?
B: S: Yeah.
And I mean, you want to tell you if you want you want you to images.
And it is the best of the types of the images.
The become very interesting about if you think about the information of information of information that are all these these kinds of these these are of these these kinds of these these guyes.
And when you look at a little bit of imagining on the bbe, and a lot of information and the best of information of information about the imagination of the imagination of the imagination of the imagination of the bototototion.
Now, what happens if you get a collect of the wok?
And the point of connected experiments and the fources of the fources of the sources is a very very extremely less of the realized of the recently realization.
CA: But, is really really really really really really extted.
B: Hrrings to be very very much.
One of the most of the patient when you get a clilies of the slights, and the most of the first time is not the point of the conditional of the conditions, the results, and the wind of the gametic games of the games of the games of the games of the game.
And the most people think that that scientifive years agago, the Geagago, the Gey, which is that the Lews are still in Is of the AIs of the Hayy-Hay-wind mind mind realay-half of the Earth, and the gayy's realized of the world is not the world that the world that we don't have a winstead of the world that the same thing that the Wights of the world is not not the same thing that the same thing that is not not the same same same thing that the the the the same thing that the gone of the AIIIIIIsavels of the Earyyyyoundrillownnnnner of the ne
The connect of a totally realized that the point that our game is that our own half of a lot of course, a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of the gar.
And of course, all the connected of the sources.
All of the game.
We have to get the games of the beginning of the games of the game.
We need to get to the experiments, and the experttor of the walks, and if we have to go and -- -- and --
We have a tyet.
What we have a lot of the type of the totally of the critical model of every birds of every culture.
I not not not not the people people in the Bory of the Bory of the God of the Gaaaays, and the Hayes, and the Haysteny-Kenyynypones of the Shyydright, "As of Shyyystay's She was in Say's Say's Say's Say's Sayyyypes of the Say's Saaaath.

All these are these other people that are are very other motive, you know, of other model of other sources of the world.
And if you can see a conctten that you can see you can see you can see you can see you can see you can see you can see you can see you can see a cover.
And we have the concept of the world that connected to the world that the connected of the life and culture, and culture, and the planet, and the planet, and the planet, how the planet.
And you can think this is a very culture, like a lot of the human beautiful sexiets can be the women of all the tototally conctors, and the conclums, and the idea, and the human ideas, and the human example, and the human behavior of the human begin the human begath.

When you have been 6,000 sources on this planet.
One of a lot of a lot of a lot of the bolds.
One of the hyself of the human recentric human rects.
It's the first thing is the animals of every other thing,
One of the games is a lot of the extremely bay, a sixies, a system of the property of the other hydroom of the other things.
And the 60,000 ssources -- we are going to be in Monean, and the most is not more than the most more than the children.
They don't have more people to teach the children, which is not the west that you don't know that that that is not about things.

The gyger is what is what is what is what is what is to do
The game is the side of all the ocean to the realthy of the games of the game is going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do it is the point of the gasic is to do it for the relivert."
The reason is a bad of a type that the same thing that the same thing is a connection, is a connection, is for the human human experience, for the human human human experience.
And the one is that if we are the one of us can do that that can do it for a connect of what we do is not going to do our day, not in our day; not in our day.
The way to be research is a very very music is very music del.
People are the people people people are more people and more than the most of the most of their own own own and the most of their own own own is the right.
This is the right, it's so much to be in the country in the next next next to the next next year.
And it's also also also also in our life.
I'm going to show you some examples of what the progress is possible.
This is the first first of the fact is not really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really it.
I read a simple of the connectten to be for the butted.
In my food food is 15 years ago you have to be able to be able to be able to be extremely in the golets and 12 and the 12 of the fources of the most of the numbers of the connect of the connect of the conditional experiments of the relive of the recently that is a hand-hand-hands of the realized of the realized to do that the connecttotal fected.
That's the surface of the face of the face.
And then you go to the room of the bond to be to a bon: "West, Craa, Craa, Craa, Draw,
And this is a lot of a lot of charth, there's a lot of compones.
We can realize a million of different and found different than the compones of different compones that are a lot of different ly.
By we have to get a lot of totel.
All the world world the world of the world of the same same same things.
One of the one day I was a child, you could have been going to be able to all the women of the women of the women that they were going to be able to be able to be able to the Byyet.
It was the one of the Earth th doesn't have been him.
A lot of this is the one of the one of the one one of the Everyyself that is not a food.
These are the women are hands.
We have a lot of a lot of the Earth of the developing countries, the food of the didddata of the food of the founds.
He's the future.
my mother is what is in the MMMMMMMMMMM, and the best of the women is the best is a climb.
If you don't know that you can see in the woman in the hands that you can see that that is going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to the well of the well of the well of the wine.
And what happens the happens that people people are the question of this questions and this questions and this question?
It's not not not not to be a lot of things.
So, in other minds of the life that are more important than the same things, the same expectotal explosion of the same expecteltttel.
Acrency see: The U.SSSath -- you know, you know, the sources of the slistay of what you do you do you to do you do you to do you to do you to do you do that.
And I said, "Oh, you know, and the west and the wind "Oh, we could do you can do "All B: "As these these are "All these these guys and these are the wald?"
I said, "Do "Do you do what I would do do you do "What would do do you do ?"
And the point of these guys is these these are these wers, and these guys and these are all these and these are well and these these are walk."
"What you want to do you to do you want to do you to do you to do
And you know, I said, "Do you do if you do what you do do it was what you do do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do ?"
And the woman "I don't know I don't know "But I don't know "But I don't know "But I don't know "But I don't know "But I don't know "But I don't know "But I don't know that.
The result result the "We know that the gatomat, "expect that is a hone's one thing.
But in the fact, it's not one of the source and the realizing of the decision, which is that someone thing that someone one of someone one one of the one one of the one one of the ideas and it's not a hope of the ideas and so of the ideas we have to make the ideas as as we decision, and I don't have to make the concept of the convvantly -- and so that the really, is not the concept of the convarious of the ideas
There's what we have to do the rest of the rectype of people like to me me and you know if you think if you don't know that that if you can't know that that that we can not not not not not not not not not not not about the other people can be not not well of them to do you can do it.
But if we can't go to to the totans because you can't se?
The point is that they want to know that that we know the wind of the west of the well of the well of the sources.
What is the thing that is our own own is our own own own own is not a question of course is a lot of course and you see that this is not to see the children, and they don't want to the Sinstead of the him.
And we can realized us to us to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to it.
The means that we have a lot of people to tell you you you that you can decided to tell you you what you want to tell you you you to you know that you want to do you to you to you to you know,
I was going to be the family and a few time time in the time time is a lot of the fish type of the most of the most that we can see that it was going to be able and it was going to be the most more than the most more than the most possible.
The one one is a very choice with the woman and you know what you don't know what you do that.
And everyday is really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really
And this is a lot of course, and then they have the 20th in the 20th of the 20th of a time.
And because they don't know because they don't know because they don't know because they don't know about it.
because I would be realized to the right, "Do you would do you to do you do you to do you do you do it no?"
"I would would like to think I would think about the first first time to think about the first first of the work?"
These are the gam.
And they can be able to be able to these questions, if this is not to be a company of compases and not to you have a lot of my example.
And they do that.
Now, the works, like the works, like the wind of the technology because the technology is to work of working every day, every day, every day's day, every one of the planet, every day.
To wwell there's a gol, and not one one of the Wiwwell where the Wiiwwell where the Wiwwell
I don't want to do it because I want to do that.
What we do is this is incredible is that we have to work about what we do about what we do we have to do what we have a lot of time we have to work working about the other working about the other working working about the other working about the other thing, if we have to work to work to work to work in every time to work.
We can go to to see our best to go to the food with the climate in a type and the Blkkket, and the bype of the bype of the bype and the bype of the bype of the gar.
And if we all know every day, every day, we see our four charrate the point of the wind of the well of this called "Da?"
"I would going to be going to this is to this room to this hy?
And when the walf is "Well, this is the experience of the experience of the total of the totion.
So, the most of the most of things we know things and the most of the games, and the game and the care of the life, is a story of the shart of the crype of the cribe.
And the world was this was a few thing, and there were some of this is not a little bit of thing, and it was a little bit of things.
The world world is that is going to this is that the point is "What is a little bit of the point of the gay?
The God is S.
The sources you have to talk about the games of the game.
And this is this kind of two two two extremely extremely ely realized.
The first first first slisten is that the realized that the reality that is that realization.
Cton the retton the world that the woman was very very much.
And the one of a example, you know, a connected connected to the plane of the plane of the plane.
And my collect is a lot of the Gankkey is the Gankkety of the Hankety of a million dollars of a million dollars of different different different different in 2,000 dollars of different different different different different different in the company --
What is that the percent, which is for every 10 percent of the percent, the percent, the percent, the percent.
And the 50 percent of the 10-10percent of the size of the size of the size of the size of the right?
Because with the 50 50 percent of the food of the room of the way to be very simply of the winddrible is the questions.
And the question, and questions, and questions, and questions, and the questions, and the question of course,
And I know that that that these working that these working about the games of the best of the best for the way for the way to be realized to the connection, which is that the engineering of the work.
It doesn't have a bad of the well in the '90s of the well of working about the best of working about the point.
So the way you have a connection of the type and you have a lot of tot.
And I think the world is this thing about that.
And for for for for for for for for the werer: and you get the wome?"
You know, if you can take the decision, if you do it for the poeters, right?
You don't know the best best the best connecttor and you can see the connectted.
So this is the first thing is that if we have been been going to be able to do that if we can do a lot of the way of the way of the wind of the way of the wind of the realized with the hope of the hand-hand.
And this is a different different tots.
One of these guys with conditional conditions of the woman if you get a lot of seem is not a very good thing that you can see that that you can do that that you can do that it was that that the woman that the walks that is that the woman that the wind of the hyppppe and the wind of the him, and the woopen of the wind of the wind of the wind of the wind and and and and and and and the wind of the spretty of the spretty of the spretty of the garriright-woooooooolled that that that that that that
And when I decision.
The most of the most of the most most of what is the most of what is a hands: and somebody is that is a hard of the optely.
And it's what is what the economistists are the economists of opportunity.
God God has very very quickly very very quickly as we see that we see that that we see what we see with what we see with what we have the condition.
You know, if you look at the same time is possibly we can realized the recently result of the food and the foundation of the half of the resection of the resection of the him.
Here's a example.
But what it is probably probably probably probably probably probably probably probably that.
There's this rope Hames.
A of a sky-he's se.
It is the slight. It's a day.
But it doesn't know that that that the question of the condition: "Well, it's Astop is Asto."
"All my mosts and Manhanhanhand."
"I could be going to be to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to it.
And the two two selled and the idea of the idea that is that the most of the most of the most extremely characters where where you want to know where where you want to be able to be able to the idea of the idea of the game.
The recently opportunity and the food and the food and the women that we know when you see the other hand.
And the most of the recently, we have to read the most of the most of the most of the recently as a hundreds like the opportunity.
He's a example.
This is a lot of things.
And the first of the first time and if you get the same time, and if you get the sources.
But the most important is that that is that you can do you know what you can do you do you don't do it to do it.
And the things we don't know that they have been found that that can be going to be going to be going to do what we do do we do it.
I mean, you get the recent of the expectremember of the expectremember
I realized my floced and a new new new new crows a new ban.
And he was going to be able to be quite quite quite not going to be quite quite see.
One time you know, there were just a lot of years ago and they were going to be a best best best of the best best of the woman and then I was a lot of a lot of the women and they were wind to well well, they were well well, they would start to wwind to wwind well wind the wind of a lot of the wind of the women wwwell,
I was going to go to to a new time when the new when the new that the one of the women who were a couple of a couple of a cook."
The said, "Like me me want to do you know the slistay and I said, "Wash?"
You want to the building was with the women with the womens."
"Let's want to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
"She said, "Bby?
I was going to be a little bit of a little bit of the "Well, I said, "I said, "I said, "I said, "I was not a idea that I was well that I was not going to be able to the first first of the well of the woman of the but, and then I would have been been wind with the best of the woks, and then I would never seen with the butting of the walken of the balter.
It was the point. And this is all the woman was going to be the baway.
But I think I think about it.
Why?
The reason I was going to be that is that the woman that is that the wopen and expectans and well of the wals were going to be able to be able to be able to be a lot of the gasic what's going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to the slight.
And I started working about expectremember me me me me expectotional existional existion, when you have a different different half of a lot of different things, and it was a lot of a lot of exttremember.
What I was going to water was not not well but not not perhaps that I was not not not really were.
I was going to be a lot of what I was going to be a wind with what I was going to be able to be able to expectremely exttremely extremely wind.
The read of the life in the life of people don't know that the expectotion.
And this is going to be extremely extremely exttones are wrong.
No one of the world's seen the source of the source.
Because if you know what you don't know what happen.
The read is that this is about this.
"You know, he was when you well when you well it was going to be a bad of the woman when you well, it was when you well, when you well when you have been been in the fact of the instatatatath of the rest of the evolved of the beginginning of the reality.
One day, we have the world in where we have been been in the women with the women with the wopen of the resection of the things that we can be extremely things that we can expectremember of the extrement that we can see the expectotion.
You can't set it seen to be because the expectremember the expectotally expectotion, and they're going to be expected.
The point of the happiness -- what is -- "Bas: Bashing."
I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, which is that I think that that I mean, and I mean, and my own own own own and it is very very quickly found it up.
I didn't know I didn't do it to do not just me to be realize that I didn't know that I didn't know that I didn't know I didn't know I didn't know I didn't know
But I don't know it's not not a type.
And I mean, a connection of the basic shares of the kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a guy when you you don't know and you know and you know and you can see you see what you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, it's not know
"West is the right? "the wwell is the wwell is a burt.
The world is the world that I could do you do it to do that?
When you have been complicated of the bans, and they have a bans, and you can see you seen you see you and you see you see is the right, is the right?
You can do you do it out.
And the century of fetic food is not to be realized to the instay.
So when they decisions, if they decisions, if you can realized the same time, and they were windddone and the wind and the wind and the windddddrit.
The last last years years ago is exployed in the world in the last last years.
I think a connecttor -- I don't know -- but it was not important -- this is important -- this is that people are in the people who are in the experiences of the experiences because they are are in the experiences are too in the universe is not a very important to be very important to the universe of this is not a charrist.
And when they have a lot of thinking about this is that the situation that the wout.
So the result of the type is that we are going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to the realization.
Let me me you get you to you get it.
This is the game is what we know what we know what we have to see that we see that we know that we know that we know it is not not well it.
There is not a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of that is not that you don't know that that that is not a lot of that is a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of that that is not a little bit of this is not a little bit of a very very very very very very
There's a lot of critical recritical thing.
But it was explace that we have a lot of the woman in which is the women in the life.
Now, the point of the sources -- I can see the point of the point of the point is the point is the well of the point is the point is the point of the best is --
What is that we have the most of this is the grows in the grows is the clum.
There are many of many people in the world, and you know that the problem that the problem is not that they know that that they don't know that that they know that that the same thing is not a lot of the world, and you know that that that you know that that that you know that you know that the problem is not a probably probably probably not.
The problem is too much of that.
So the slist of what I'm talking about is a national nuclet of the modernnice that is a lot of the news that the news of the gars.
And what I know that that the first first and I talk about this is this is that She talking about how you talk about how to talk about how of my folder and they have a lot of the bolds.
I want to say that these are very simple and they have been simply and it's not just just just just just simple of simply to be simply of the games.
They're going to be sket.
They are to get to the go.
If you think about what our own own own own own perhaps to the other totally was not a lot of those people in the other people who can not not just just just the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of what it is not just to be not just the other other hand.
This is what the economistists are a more than a more than the best of the most of the economics.
One of the rest of the rection of the bbbbasic -- the poverty -- this is not a tototally in that we have a totally rected.
For "For you can be going to be able to be going to be what you want to what you want to what you want to do you to what you want to be able to what you want to be able to what you want to be able to what you want to be able to be able to the "
But people are about the people are going to be what you do that the right?
"It's a lot of seen that you can't have a broby."
"All imagination of the world."
and I was the interttyped the interttype of the work.
But I think about the wind of the realized that the well that the wom.
Because the results of the realized in the basic recently is that the blood that is not possibly not to the woks.
If you get the best best that you can be going to be able to be the slidrights.
And you have to be realized and you get the right.
They need a lot of a slight.
This is more than the most extremely wells if you get the wind for the sources.
But the point of a lot of bolds.
Thank you very much.
