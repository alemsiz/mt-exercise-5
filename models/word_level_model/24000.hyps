<unk> year, I showed these <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, which for almost three million years had the size of the United States <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> of 40 percent.
I'm going to <unk> this <unk> of the problem because it doesn't show the <unk> of the ice <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> is, in a way, the heart of the <unk> of the climate system.
It's <unk> and <unk> in summer.
The next <unk> is going to be a <unk> <unk> <unk> on the last 25 years.
<unk> <unk> are <unk> in red.
You see, it <unk> up to the blue <unk>.
That's the ice in <unk>, which is <unk> in summer.
You can see that the <unk> ice <unk>, of five years or more, it's like the blood, which here <unk> from the body.
In 25 years it's been so.
This is a problem because the <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> ground around the ocean where there are enormous <unk> of <unk> that, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, are <unk> in <unk> by the <unk>.
<unk> to the <unk> of <unk> <unk> by global <unk>, that <unk> could <unk>, <unk> this point of not <unk>.
In some <unk> <unk>, it's already <unk> by <unk> <unk> is already <unk> by the water.
The <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>! <unk>: She's good. The question is if you <unk> it's also.
A reason is that this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from the north.
This is a river in <unk> <unk>.
<unk> had never <unk> at that similar.
This is the <unk> river, in the <unk> of <unk>.
If you want to know how the <unk> <unk> <unk> on the sea level, you know where the sea.
These <unk> are <unk> <unk>.
<unk> else on the planet: <unk>, the largest <unk> of ice on the planet.
<unk> month, <unk> scientists have <unk> that the <unk> of the ice is in <unk>, and that <unk> on some <unk> <unk>, is particularly <unk> in <unk>.
<unk> at six feet of the level of <unk>, like in <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, the largest <unk> <unk> of ice, you see new <unk>, which a few years ago.
<unk> percent of the world's population <unk> water from that <unk>.
<unk> <unk>: this <unk> is the source of water <unk> of this city.
The <unk> is <unk>.
But when you <unk>, the same happens to the water.
<unk> <unk> <unk> is 40 percent.
<unk> <unk> are in the crisis.
<unk>, as you read, are <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> in the world leads to a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> are <unk> out of the normal and <unk>.
<unk> times more <unk> in the last 30 years of <unk> <unk>.
This is a <unk> <unk>.
If you look in the <unk> context, you can see the <unk>.
In the last five years we have <unk> 70 million <unk> of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million <unk> in the ocean every day.
Look at the area of the <unk> <unk>, from <unk>, to <unk>, and both of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, where there's a <unk> <unk> of oxygen in the ocean.
The biggest <unk> of global warming, together with <unk>, which is 20 percent, is the use of <unk> <unk>.
The oil is a problem, and <unk> is even worse.
The United States is one of the most countries with <unk> <unk>, together.
And it <unk> to build a lot of other <unk> <unk>.
But we're going to <unk> a <unk> of direction.
These are the projects <unk> over the last few years and some <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
And so, there's a <unk> policy in our country.
<unk> <unk> and oil <unk> <unk> million dollars in the last year to <unk> <unk>, which is a <unk>.
I'm going to <unk> me something --
<unk> <unk>, where I live, there was a <unk> <unk> billion <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
Maybe you've seen it on the <unk>.
This is the largest flow of <unk> in America.
It's happened around <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> of one of the <unk> <unk> was this.
<unk>: <unk> â™« <unk> <unk> is a <unk> and happy.
It's <unk> here in America, and it makes our economy.
<unk> <unk> is <unk> and <unk>.
It's <unk>, <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk>: From here, from here is a lot of <unk> <unk>.
The largest <unk> society on the <unk> is <unk> <unk>. This is his <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> <unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk> -- Al <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> -- they don't know what they're talking about.
<unk>: So the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> two <unk>.
This is one of them, one part.
<unk>: <unk>: At <unk>, we see <unk> changes as a <unk> <unk> to our business.
And so our <unk> is <unk> a lot of money in a <unk> <unk> to make public and <unk> the truth in <unk>.
In fact, <unk> is not <unk>.
We think it's <unk> -- it's also a good <unk>.
So we don't understand about climate change.
You could do it.
<unk>: <unk> <unk>: <unk> <unk> -- you've heard a lot of it.
So I'm going to <unk> a <unk> <unk> for <unk>.
<unk>! <unk> machines. They're a little <unk>, but this is the sound of technology of <unk>.
<unk> <unk> is between the main <unk> of global warming, but <unk> technology technology <unk> that you see changes everything.
Let's look at this: this is the <unk> technology of <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to the economic security.
<unk>: <unk>: America is in the crisis; the <unk>, national security, the crisis <unk>.
The <unk> that <unk> all: our <unk> from the <unk> <unk>, like <unk> and oil <unk>.
Now, <unk>, there's a new <unk>, <unk> solution.
<unk> America: 100 percent of <unk> energy, in 10 years.
A <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> more <unk>, and help to help <unk> global warming.
<unk>, a solution that we could solve our problems.
<unk> America. <unk> more.
<unk>: This is the last one.
<unk>: It's about <unk> energy to America.
One of the most <unk> ways to <unk> <unk> from the <unk> that we <unk> our planet.
<unk>: The future is here. <unk>, sun, a new network.
<unk> <unk> two: <unk> <unk> for jobs <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> America. It's time to be <unk>.
<unk>: A <unk> <unk> <unk> says, "If you want to go to go from alone.
If you want to go far, go together. "
We have to go far, fast.
Thank you very much.
<unk> year at TED, I did an <unk> on <unk>.
And I'm going to try to <unk> how it works.
So I'm going to go. And for those who were not, the <unk> is the greatest scientific experiment ever <unk> -- <unk> miles of <unk>.
His task is to <unk> the conditions that were in less than a <unk> of the universe from the beginning of the universe -- to <unk> million times a second.
All right.
This is the <unk> machine.
They <unk> these <unk> <unk> inside the <unk>.
This is what I work on. It's called <unk> -- is <unk> feet and it's <unk> feet.
This is a <unk> picture of <unk> <unk> in building so you can see <unk>.
<unk> <unk> last year, we <unk> the car for the first time.
And this picture was <unk> by <unk>.
It was because of <unk> <unk> in control.
It's an image of the first <unk> of particles that he had made all the <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, with a part of the <unk>, and <unk> particles inside the <unk>.
In other words, when you take that picture the 10 <unk>, I would <unk> that machine, which is a great <unk>.
I don't know if it was to <unk> us more or this, when somebody <unk> on Google and I knew that the <unk> page was this.
And that means we've had a <unk> <unk> impact over to this scientific.
And I was a week later, there was a problem with the car, had to just these <unk> here -- these <unk> <unk>.
These <unk> <unk> <unk> when the car works at the <unk> of <unk>.
Now, the <unk> of you <unk> the <unk> and <unk>, "It's not true. I'm too <unk>."
And instead they can do it because when they're very <unk> <unk> <unk>.
So, <unk> degrees, at a temperature <unk> to the space of the stars, these <unk> can bring that <unk>.
In one of the <unk> of <unk> <unk>, there was a <unk> of <unk>.
So the <unk> <unk> <unk>, and the <unk> <unk> <unk> a electric electric <unk>.
This was the result.
Now, this is even more <unk> if you think that these <unk> <unk> more than 20 <unk>, and <unk> <unk> about 30 <unk>.
They <unk> about 50 <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, what we did.
We <unk> them and <unk>.
They're now <unk> to their <unk> place.
<unk> the end of <unk> <unk> is going to be again.
We <unk> it, and we try and get data <unk> or <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk> our <unk> to find out what the universe is.
Now, of course, in a way, these <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> of science and engineering engineering engineering of <unk>. It's easy to <unk>.
I think the fact that it's so hard, the fact that we're going to go beyond the <unk>, I think it's the value of things like <unk>.
I'd like to end with the words of a <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, which, <unk>, <unk> <unk> was Michael <unk>, he said, "No," No, so <unk> for the progress of the human mind as <unk> as the ideas of science are <unk>, that there are not <unk> in nature, that our <unk> are <unk>, and that there are no new <unk> from. "
Thank you.
I want to start <unk> to when, children, <unk> <unk>.
As I was <unk> and <unk>, <unk> and <unk> and <unk>, actually, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> relationships.
The <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> <unk> to how much <unk> the world around us.
So, as a <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of our <unk> with objects with <unk>, and my <unk> <unk> <unk>, and my <unk> <unk> <unk>, I started <unk>, "And if we use a computer, instead of having the only <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> information with a <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> information with a <unk>,
and <unk> to our <unk>?
The question was so interesting that I thought I was going to <unk> the answer, building.
In a few words, a <unk> is a computer <unk> like a <unk>.
In a few words, a <unk> is a computer <unk> like a <unk>.
You can <unk> them with your hand, they can hear their <unk> and <unk> their movement and have a screen and a <unk> <unk>.
But <unk>, they're <unk> objects, like <unk>, you can just <unk>.
<unk> are the example of a new tools to <unk> digital information.
And as they become more <unk>, <unk> of their movement, other, and as they become more <unk>, <unk> of their movement, <unk>, <unk> of its movement, other, of how we <unk> them, we can explore new and <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Let's start with some simple example.
This <unk> is <unk> to show you about video: if you put it in a direction, the other <unk>, you would have to show that if you put it in a direction, you'll go back.
These <unk> <unk> are <unk>.
If you <unk> them, you <unk> what it's around.
If they're <unk>, they can <unk> it and they can <unk> a little bit.
If they're <unk>, they can <unk> it and they can <unk> a little bit.
They also <unk> their movement and <unk>.
We have <unk> that one of the interesting <unk> of the <unk> was that we could use common on <unk> on data, for example, "<unk>" color "a <unk>."
In this case, we have three <unk> <unk> as a <unk> of <unk> and I can <unk> to <unk> color in the <unk>, where they <unk>.
and I can <unk> to <unk> color in <unk>, where you're <unk>.
If we can <unk> it, we can <unk> a little bit.
There are also <unk> <unk> <unk>, like <unk>, <unk> and games where people can try things, and <unk> where people can try things, and <unk> the results immediately.
Now I'm --
This is a <unk> sequence that I do with a <unk> program.
Here we have a word of words that is in half <unk> and <unk>.
<unk>, at every <unk> <unk> a letter on every <unk>, <unk>, to every <unk>, <unk> a letter on every <unk>, and while I was talking about <unk> words, he <unk> on a <unk>.
Then, about 30 seconds, you get <unk>, and you have a new chance of <unk>.
Thank you.
Here I have kids <unk> in <unk> at <unk> <unk>, I did so that I <unk> them and <unk> a video.
They're very much <unk>.
And one of the interesting things of this <unk> is that you don't have to give people many <unk>.
I just mean, "<unk> of words, and they know what to do.
Here we go to people who <unk> it.
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, right there.
It actually wanted to <unk>.
They were just <unk>, for him.
Now, this is a <unk> of a <unk> <unk>.
You could build a <unk> <unk> <unk>. He's <unk>.
It can <unk> new characters in the scene, <unk> <unk> their <unk>.
It can <unk> new characters in the scene, <unk> <unk> their <unk>.
So, it's <unk> out the sun.
<unk>: The sun is <unk>.
David <unk>: Now he brought a <unk> in the scene.
<unk>: The <unk> <unk>.
<unk>. Yeah! Yeah!
So <unk> <unk> and <unk> can <unk> the characters --
<unk>: <unk>!
<unk> your story.
<unk>: <unk>!
<unk>: It's a story with the <unk> <unk>, and it can decide how to <unk>.
<unk>: It's a story with the <unk> <unk>, and it can decide how to <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> away, <unk>.
<unk>: The last example I have time to show you is a tool, made of <unk> and <unk> music.
it's a tool, made of <unk>, to <unk> and <unk> music.
The <unk> here <unk> <unk> by <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> of these has four different <unk>, and you can choose what to use.
You can also <unk> these <unk> in a sequence <unk> <unk>.
And they just <unk> by making a <unk> and a sequence.
These are the effects that you can control of live, like <unk> and <unk>.
I'm going to <unk> it to a particular sound and then <unk> to <unk>.
And then there are the <unk> effects of time and <unk>, which <unk> to the entire sequence.
<unk> like it works.
<unk>: <unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> into a series, <unk>, <unk> into a series, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
Now I'm going to take a <unk> line.
<unk>: Now I'm going to <unk> <unk>...
<unk>: And now I'm going to <unk> the <unk> to the <unk>, so I can control the effect of live.
<unk>: <unk>: I can <unk> the entire sequence <unk> the <unk> <unk> on one, or on the other.
<unk>: And now I'm going to <unk> the <unk> <unk> to give you <unk>.
<unk>: I can <unk> the <unk> <unk> "<unk>"
So I don't have to <unk> before, but I can <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
And now, finally, I can <unk> the entire sequence <unk> <unk> the <unk> "<unk>."
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is to build new <unk> <unk> <unk> to how our brain work and body.
And today, I've had time to show you one of the results of this path, and also some chance we try to bring out of the lab.
The concept I want to <unk> is that it's <unk> this new generation of objects to <unk> the <unk>, which <unk> information in our world in the way we want.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the time I'm going to talk to all of you.
I'm a <unk>.
<unk> books is my <unk>, but it's more than this, of course.
It's also love and the <unk> of my life.
And I'm not <unk> what it can change.
But, this is a <unk> <unk> <unk> in my life and my career, who led me to <unk> the whole relationship with this work.
The particular thing is I wrote this book, this <unk> called "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
And the result is that <unk> <unk> now, people <unk> me as if I was <unk>.
<unk> -- <unk>, <unk>!
I'm going to <unk> me and they say, "You don't fear you don't have afraid to be able to do it?
You don't fear <unk> for all life without being able to be able to create a book that could <unk> to someone? "
What can it be? "
It's <unk>, you know.
But it could go worse, except for me that I remember over 20 years ago, when I started to tell people -- I was a <unk> -- I wanted to be a <unk>.
I'm going to <unk> the same <unk> by fear.
And people said, "Don't you know I don't know I'm not going to be able to be successful?
You don't get fear <unk> <unk> you?
You don't <unk> to do this <unk> for all life without anything to have anything to die on a <unk> of <unk>'s <unk> <unk>'s mouth? "
So, you know.
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is, "Yes."
Yeah, I'm afraid of all those things.
I've always had fear.
And I've also fear of many other things that people couldn't <unk>.
As <unk> and other things <unk>.
But, as I'm about writing what I thought and <unk> me is why?
Is it <unk>?
It's <unk> that anyone who <unk> <unk> to be <unk> by a job that you feel in order to do.
But what's about so particular in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> about health <unk> <unk> in a way that other <unk> do they don't do?
How about my father, for example, he was a <unk> <unk> and I don't remember one time in his <unk> <unk> to be asked if they were afraid to be <unk>?
There was never -- that <unk> of <unk> John, how do you go?
<unk>'t like that, <unk>?
<unk>, engineers as a group, engineers as a group, <unk>, <unk> the <unk> of being <unk> <unk>.
We <unk>, we have enough this <unk>, and not only <unk> but <unk> of all of all of these <unk>, we have this <unk> to be <unk> <unk>.
And I don't know, look at the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that, only in the <unk> century, <unk> young and <unk>.
And the ones that don't have <unk> to be really <unk> by their <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, before he died, in the last <unk> said, "Every book my book <unk> me a little bit more." And a little bit more <unk>. "And so, <unk> <unk> about the work of their own life.
But we don't know when we <unk> it to say because we've heard these things so long that we have completely <unk> and <unk> the <unk> that creativity and <unk> are in some way <unk> and the art, at the end, <unk>.
And the question I want to <unk> all here today is: Do you agree with this idea?
And I'm going to tell you this thing -- because it's also <unk> by a <unk> distance to me.
I think it's <unk>.
And I think it's also <unk> and I don't want to <unk> <unk> in the next century.
I think it's better to <unk> our great <unk> to live.
And I know that, in my case -- it would be very <unk> to start <unk> to that <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that I'm in my career.
<unk> -- <unk> look, I'm young, I've got about 40 years.
I still have about four <unk> of work in me.
And it's very <unk> that anything <unk> <unk>, and then it's going to be <unk> by the world like the work that I would <unk> after the last book book.
<unk> <unk>, because we're all <unk> or less friends here -- is <unk> that my greatest success is to my <unk>.
Oh, <unk>, what's thinking.
You know, this is the kind of thought that leads to a person to start <unk> at nine to the morning at nine of the morning and I don't want to do it.
I want to keep doing this work that I love.
So, the question is, how?
And so it seems to me, after many <unk>, that the way of work to do is to create a <unk> <unk> <unk>, OK?
I have to go to a few <unk> away between me, which I'm <unk>, and my natural <unk> on which wrote <unk>. And, as I'm going to go through the time, trying to find through time, trying to find other societies that if we have better ideas and more <unk>.
about how to help people <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity.
And that research led me to the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
It's because I was <unk> in <unk> and then <unk> back.
<unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> -- people don't believe that creativity <unk> creativity, OK?
And it was <unk> that creativity was this <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> to men from a few <unk> <unk> and <unk>, for reasons <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> <unk> these <unk> <unk> of creativity of <unk> "<unk>."
<unk>, <unk>, <unk> to have a <unk> that <unk> <unk> from far.
The <unk> were the same idea, but they would have that species of spirit without a <unk>.
And that's <unk>, because the <unk> <unk> didn't really understand that a <unk> was somebody particularly.
And I thought that a <unk> species of <unk> <unk> that <unk> literally <unk> <unk> up in the <unk> of a artist, a little bit like <unk> <unk>, and <unk> out of <unk> the artist's work. And I was <unk> out of the <unk> of that work.
<unk> <unk> <unk> you from that <unk>, the distance I'm talking -- that <unk> <unk> you from the results of your work.
And everybody thought it was so that I was <unk>, right?
So, artists were <unk> by <unk> things, like, for example, the too <unk>, right?
If your work work was <unk>, you don't <unk> to <unk> the <unk>, everybody <unk> that was <unk> by this <unk> <unk>.
If your work work <unk>, it wasn't all your <unk>, right?
<unk> that was your <unk> to be a <unk>.
And so people would <unk> <unk> creativity in <unk> for a long time.
Then the <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk>, and we <unk> this great idea; we put the human <unk> on the universe on top of the universe, and the <unk> and <unk> and no longer leave space to <unk> by <unk>.
This was the <unk> principle and people tend to think that creativity is <unk> by <unk>.
And for the first time in history, <unk> to <unk> this one or that artist as a rather than one person with <unk>.
And I have to <unk>, I think it was a big <unk>.
I think of somebody, a simple person to believe that they were like a <unk> like a source, <unk> and <unk> and <unk> of all the <unk> <unk>, <unk> and <unk> and <unk> is a responsibility for a <unk> <unk>.
It's like to ask someone to <unk> the sun.
<unk> and <unk> the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> all these <unk> <unk> on the <unk>.
And I think it was this pressure <unk> that artists in the <unk> 500 years.
And if that is true, and I think it's, and I think it's, the question now?
Can we do it?
I could go back to a more <unk> understanding of human relationship between human and <unk> <unk>.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we can't <unk> 500 years of thinking in a <unk> talk in a 18 minutes.
And there's probably people in the audience who <unk> <unk> <unk> on their <unk>, <unk>, do you know, you know, you know, <unk> people <unk> <unk> on their projects.
You probably don't like all about this.
But the question I'd like to <unk> you is -- why not?
Why don't we <unk> it in this way?
Because it's more sense of anything that I've ever heard to explain the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> process.
A process that, as anyone who ever <unk> to do something -- so, basically, everybody here -- knows, you know, you don't have to <unk>.
And in fact, it can look completely <unk>.
I did this meeting <unk> with an amazing <unk> <unk>, who has now 90 years old, but that was a <unk> for all life and said that during his <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk>, <unk> out in the <unk> <unk>, <unk> out of the <unk>.
And he said, like a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And that I was going to go to her from <unk>.
I could get it, because he was <unk> the ground below his feet.
I thought I had one thing to do to do to do at that point and was, he said, "<unk> as a <unk>."
And so he went to home and he was <unk> by this <unk>, and he would not have to take a piece of paper and a <unk> enough <unk>, and a <unk> <unk> <unk> on the page.
<unk> times I couldn't be enough, so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> the <unk> through the <unk>, and she would <unk> her <unk> and she would <unk> through the <unk>, looking, as she said, "another <unk>."
Then there were those times -- this piece would never <unk> it -- there was some moments when he was almost <unk>, OK?
So, he was coming home and was looking for paper and he <unk> the <unk> through, and he had a <unk> right in the while he was <unk> with the other hand and the <unk>.
I <unk> the <unk> from the tail and <unk> in his body and <unk> on the page.
And in these cases, the <unk> would be <unk> on the <unk> page, but <unk>, on the last word to the first word to the first word to the first.
So when I <unk> it -- it's <unk>, it's exactly <unk> to my <unk> process.
Not the whole process of my <unk> process -- I'm not a <unk>!
I'm a <unk>, and my way of <unk> is; I'm going to <unk> every day and <unk> and work on top of it.
But even me, in my <unk>, I <unk> against that thing, sometimes.
And I think that many of you have the <unk> <unk>.
You know, even if the work and ideas I would <unk> me from a source I couldn't have to be <unk>.
And what is this thing?
And how can we <unk> it so that we don't have to <unk> your head, but rather, what does it <unk> us?
As I'm <unk>, the best example I have is the <unk> <unk> <unk>, which I've been <unk> <unk>, which I've been <unk> a lot of years ago for a <unk>.
I'm talking about this, and you know, <unk>, for the <unk> of life was the <unk> of the <unk> artist <unk>, trying to control, <unk> these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
But then <unk>, he was <unk>, and one day while he was sitting on a <unk> <unk>, <unk> everything for him.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>, but it doesn't feel this little <unk> of <unk>, that comes into his head as <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, and you want, you know, it's wonderful, and the <unk>, but it doesn't know how to <unk>.
It's not a <unk>, it doesn't have a <unk>, it doesn't have a <unk>.
So he starts to hear this <unk> species of old <unk> growing in him, "I'm going to lose, and I'm going to <unk>, and I'm going to <unk> this song.
I'm not enough <unk> and I can't <unk>. "
And instead of going to go to the <unk>, they <unk>.
<unk> the whole process and made something completely new.
I just <unk> the sky and said, "<unk>, you don't see I'm <unk>?"
"<unk> you that can write a song now?"
If you really want to <unk>, you'll <unk> it, you'll be <unk> when I can take care of it.
<unk>, <unk> to <unk> <unk> else today.
I'm going to <unk> <unk>. "
And his process <unk> <unk> after this.
Not the work, it was still <unk> as always.
But the process, and the <unk> <unk> that <unk> was <unk> when he <unk>, the <unk> that came from him, and the <unk> that came from him, and I would <unk> it back where he was, and he was, and he thought it didn't have to be something that was <unk> and <unk>.
but I was <unk> this <unk>, wonderful <unk> <unk> <unk> a conversation between <unk> and this <unk> thing that but it wasn't <unk>.
So, how I was going to change a little bit of a way I'm going to <unk> you, and I'm going to <unk> me once.
This idea, I was <unk> when I was <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>," and I went to a <unk> <unk> when we're working on something and you can't think it's going to be a <unk>, that what's going to be the <unk> book.
Not just <unk>, just <unk>, right the book.
And I started thinking about <unk> this project.
But then I was <unk> to <unk> that <unk> to the air and I <unk>.
So I <unk> my face on the <unk> and I <unk> my <unk> to a <unk> corner of the room.
And I said to <unk>, "<unk>, what, we know, is, we know that if this book book is not going to be <unk>, right?
Because as you see, I'm <unk> everything I have, I don't have this.
So if you want it to be better, you have to <unk> and do your part.
OK. But if you don't do it, you know what, you don't like me.
I was writing the same because it's my work.
And I would like to be <unk> that I've been <unk> to do my <unk>. "Because at the end is so, OK -- <unk>, it's in the <unk> Africa of the North Africa, people <unk> to <unk> the <unk> of the moon, <unk> and <unk> music that would <unk> to <unk> hours and hours to <unk>.
And they were always <unk>, because the <unk> were <unk> and <unk>.
But every so much, <unk>, something <unk>, and one of these <unk> artists actually <unk>.
And I know what you know, because I know what you have seen, at a point, a <unk>.
It was like if time <unk>, and the <unk> <unk> through a kind of <unk> and it wasn't doing anything different from the <unk> <unk>, but everything <unk>.
And all of a sudden they don't just like a human.
But it <unk> by <unk> and under the <unk> of <unk>.
And when this <unk>, at the time, people <unk> what was, he <unk> with his name.
<unk> your hands and <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, God," God, "
That's God, you know.
<unk> <unk> -- when the <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> of <unk>, I <unk> this <unk> with them and <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, which you can hear in the <unk> or in <unk>.
In <unk>, when an artist has done something impossible and <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>," <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>," <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>,
And it's <unk> because we need it.
But the problem comes up to the next day, for <unk>, when you <unk> and <unk> that are 11 <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and <unk> of God.
It's simply a <unk> with <unk> <unk>, and maybe never <unk> to <unk> it.
And maybe nobody <unk> the name of God still <unk>, and what does it have to do with the rest of his life?
It's hard.
This is one of the most <unk> <unk> to do in a <unk> life.
But maybe it doesn't have to be so <unk> if you can't believe, that the most <unk> <unk> of your being being <unk> by you.
But I just <unk> you that data from a <unk> source of this <unk> part of your life that you have to have to go to <unk> when you're doing.
And, you know, if we think it's all changes.
And so I started <unk>, and it's certainly how I've <unk> it for several months during the <unk> of the book that I was soon, the <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> of my success.
And what I have to keep <unk> when I feel like this is, I don't feel afraid.
You don't <unk>. You just <unk> your work.
You can <unk> for your part, any could be.
If your work is <unk>, you're <unk>.
If you <unk>, you would <unk> to <unk> you would have some kind of <unk>, for one moment through your <unk>, then "<unk>!"
<unk>, you do the same your <unk>.
And "<unk>!" <unk>! "
I think it's <unk>.
"<unk>!" <unk>! "<unk>" <unk>! "<unk>"
Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk>: <unk>!
As you know, I've been talking about some of these projects on human genome, what can <unk> and the discovery of new genes.
Now we're going to <unk> a new path: we started <unk> biology and now from that digital code, we're <unk> into a new <unk> of biology, <unk> and <unk> life.
We always tried to <unk> <unk>.
"What is the life?" It's something that many <unk> have <unk> to understand at various levels.
We tried several <unk>, <unk> to <unk> terms.
We're <unk> for almost 20 years.
When we <unk> the human genome <unk> to go from the <unk> world of biology to the digital computer.
Now, what do we can <unk> life, or create new life from this digital universe?
This is a map of a small <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, which is the species from the <unk> genome between those that can <unk> into the lab.
And we tried to reduce the genome to <unk> one even smaller.
We can <unk> a <unk> of about 500 genes that are here.
But when we look at its <unk> map, it's <unk> simple than our.
<unk>, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can <unk>, one at one time, it's very <unk> that this can bring a <unk> cell.
So I thought the only way to <unk> was <unk> this <unk> so that we could <unk> <unk> the <unk> to <unk> some of these questions.
And so we started the <unk> of "We can <unk> a <unk>?"
Can the chemistry <unk> of <unk> these big molecules that we've never been able to create before?
And in case, can we <unk> a <unk>?
A <unk> is simply a piece of <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The speed we're able to <unk> life is <unk> <unk>.
Our ability to write the code, instead, <unk> rather slowly, but it's <unk>.
And our <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We've been <unk> over 15 years ago.
The process has <unk> a lot of <unk>, <unk> with a <unk> <unk> before <unk> experiments.
But we found that DNA <unk> is very difficult.
There are <unk> of thousands of cars in the world that <unk> small <unk> of DNA, <unk> <unk>, and it's a <unk> process: the <unk> is a <unk> process: the <unk> is long, <unk> there are.
So we had to develop a new <unk> to <unk> these <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
And this was our first <unk>, starting from information digital <unk> genome.
It's a little <unk> that <unk> bacteria.
We designed <unk>, <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> a <unk> of DNA about <unk> <unk>.
The interesting part is when we took this piece of <unk> <unk> <unk> and we <unk> it into the bacteria, the bacteria have <unk> to read this code and <unk> particles.
<unk> particles have been <unk> by cells, are <unk> back and <unk> <unk>.
I've been talking recently with members of the <unk> industry that they certainly <unk> this model.
They have more than you.
And I think this is a situation where software can actually build his <unk> in a <unk> system.
But we could do the biggest things in the <unk>.
You could build the entire <unk> of <unk>.
They're more than <unk> <unk> <unk> of code.
So we thought we could <unk> in the size of the virus, so that we can change the <unk> to understand what the <unk> of a <unk> cell.
The <unk> is <unk>, and if you <unk> information with information in a computer, they need to be very <unk>.
When we <unk> this genome for the first time in <unk> <unk>, it was a <unk> for every 10 <unk> <unk>.
We found, <unk>, 30 <unk>. If we were using that original sequence would never be able to do it work.
One part of the process is design <unk> <unk> 50 <unk> <unk> <unk> with all the other <unk> of 50 <unk> to build smaller than <unk> together.
<unk> elements here.
You've probably read that <unk> us of <unk>.
<unk>: We have a <unk> code on four <unk>: A, <unk>, <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> of those <unk> <unk> <unk> together about 20 <unk>, and there's a <unk> order to <unk> every <unk>.
So we can use the code for <unk> words, <unk>, <unk>.
What we did at the beginning was <unk>.
Some of them were <unk> by the fact that it wasn't <unk>.
We designed these <unk> to <unk> by <unk> by <unk>.
There are <unk> that <unk> them and <unk> them.
And we started <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
At every step, we have produced these <unk> <unk> so that we're trying to create a very <unk> <unk> <unk> that we're going to see a minute.
We're trying to <unk> the process.
So, this seems to <unk> of a <unk> <unk>.
When I started these very <unk>, much more than 100 <unk> <unk>, you don't get <unk> directly directly in the <unk> <unk>.
You get to the <unk> <unk> of <unk> biology.
So we have <unk> some other <unk>.
<unk> of another <unk> called <unk> <unk>, which in biology <unk> to <unk> DNA.
Here's one example.
This <unk>, called <unk> <unk>, can <unk> three million <unk> <unk>.
You can see in the <unk> <unk> like his <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> hours, it's <unk> exactly like it was before.
<unk> thousands of organisms that are able to do it.
These organisms can <unk> completely.
I could live under <unk>.
I'm absolutely sure that life <unk> in space, and you're going to find new <unk> of water <unk>.
Actually, NASA has shown that this is happening.
This is a picture of the <unk> we built by using these <unk>, just by by using <unk> with the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> <unk> them.
This is not <unk> with a <unk> <unk>, but with a <unk> <unk>.
It's so <unk> that we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk>.
These are pictures that <unk> a time of about six seconds.
This is the <unk> we've done a little time ago.
They're more than <unk> <unk> of code.
It's the largest <unk> of a <unk> structure ever <unk> by man.
It's got a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
If you <unk> it with a <unk> 10 <unk>, you would have to <unk> pages to <unk> this code.
Now, how do we make it work? How can we <unk>?
<unk>, of course, is a game from kids.
It's a little bit more <unk> when you use bacteria.
It's <unk> when it's about <unk> cells like our: you can just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> another, which is basically the process of <unk>.
In <unk>, <unk>, it's <unk> instead of <unk> in the cell, but we have <unk> <unk> that we can do a <unk> <unk> from a <unk> <unk> from one cell to another and <unk>.
We <unk> a <unk> <unk> by a <unk> species.
The two are as many men from <unk>.
We <unk> some <unk> <unk> in a way that we could decide which to choose for this <unk>.
And then he <unk> with <unk> so that we could <unk> all the <unk>.
And when we put it in the cell was <unk> and <unk> our <unk> <unk> the new <unk> went into the <unk> <unk>.
And I would say that we don't want to go beyond, but we tried to <unk> more in there.
This is one of the biggest <unk> of evolution.
We found that <unk> species have <unk> a second or a third <unk> <unk> somewhere, <unk> in a second thousands of new <unk> to that species.
So who thinks evolution as one <unk> at one time <unk> at the time it <unk> doesn't have a lot of biology.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> DNA.
The <unk> that was in the cell, you know,
The <unk> <unk> we have <unk> it.
It's <unk>, and it <unk> the other <unk> like <unk>, <unk> it, and we <unk> with only the cell cell and the new <unk>.
It's become blue because of the genes we've <unk>.
And in a short <unk> of time, all the <unk> of a species <unk> go <unk>, and <unk> of all in a new species, <unk> on the new software that we <unk> in the cell.
All the <unk> are <unk>, and the <unk> are <unk>, and when you <unk> the code <unk> <unk> to what we've <unk> you.
Now, this may seem <unk>, but we can <unk> the software, we can change things <unk>.
Now, I've already <unk> that's not talking about <unk> -- but of progress from progress from three million years and a half years and a half years of evolution, and I already said that maybe we're going to create a new species of <unk> on this digital process.
Why do that?
I think it's quite <unk> when we think of our <unk>.
We're going to go from six and a half billion people in the next 40 years.
Just to give one example: I was born in <unk>.
Now there are three people on the planet to <unk> <unk>; in 40 years, there will be four.
We're <unk> problems now to find food, water and <unk>, <unk> and <unk> and <unk> for six billion people.
I'm going to have to do it for nine billion.
<unk> more than five billion <unk>, more than 30 billion <unk> <unk>.
That means 100 million <unk> a day.
When we try to find <unk> <unk>, or any kind of process to <unk>, it will be a huge challenge.
<unk> we have to realize that all of CO2 from these materials that we <unk> into the atmosphere.
At the day, with the <unk> <unk> of the world, we have a <unk> with about 20 million genes, and I like to think are <unk> for the future.
The <unk> industry is only about a <unk> of <unk>, and think of how many different things are <unk> out.
Our <unk> here is <unk> data from reality and our imagination.
Now we have <unk>, <unk> to these <unk> <unk> <unk>, able to create what we call <unk> <unk>.
We can build a big robot that can produce a million <unk> a day.
Think of <unk> these 20 million genes or <unk> <unk> <unk> to produce <unk> or <unk>, new <unk>, new <unk>, we can change, with a small team, and create, we can change, with a small team, and create <unk> biology.
And it's simply a standard <unk>.
We can choose to <unk> <unk>, chemistry or <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
This is a <unk> of some software <unk> that we're working on to be able to <unk> and design species to computers.
Well, we don't know how they will be.
We know exactly how their code code.
Now we're going to <unk> on the <unk> generation.
You've seen that <unk> <unk> from the <unk> was a <unk> experiment.
We have <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> as soon as soon as we went from <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> like <unk> or different types of <unk>.
But the only way biology can have a big impact <unk> <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the <unk> would be <unk> CO2 in matter before we're working on to design cells that can achieve that purpose, and we think we can get the first <unk> of <unk> generation in about 18 months.
<unk> <unk> with CO2 is a <unk>, but in our <unk> of <unk>, in our <unk> of <unk>, we found different <unk>.
This is a <unk> that we <unk> in <unk>.
<unk> in the ocean, about <unk> feet of <unk> at the temperature of water.
<unk> <unk> by CO2 by <unk> hydrogen <unk> as source of energy.
We're trying to figure out if we can <unk> CO2, that can easily be <unk> by <unk>, <unk> that <unk> CO2 in <unk>, to drive this process.
So short, we think that we might be able to <unk> what life is, "We, we, we, we have the <unk> goal of <unk> the whole industry.
<unk>. If you can't do it from TED, where can you?
I want a source of energy.
<unk>, we're working for the same <unk> to create <unk>.
You saw this year with flu, we're always back a year and with a dollar in less when it's about <unk>.
I think that's going to be <unk> <unk> <unk>.
So, this is how the future could be <unk>, now, the tree of evolution, <unk> the tree with bacteria, <unk>, <unk> cells.
We are so <unk> people.
Our purpose is to make a way of living enough to try to <unk>. Thank you very much.
<unk> I'm going to show you, the <unk> <unk> possible, some <unk> work, some <unk>, new technology that we've taken on a <unk> <unk> almost a year ago. This is <unk>.
It's a environment where you can <unk> both <unk> at local level that you can <unk> with a huge amount of data.
Here we're seeing <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk>, for a quick <unk>, <unk> <unk>, for a fast <unk>, <unk> the images like we want.
And it doesn't matter how big the amount of information that we see, how big these <unk> of data <unk> or images.
Most of them are <unk> photographs, but this is a <unk> <unk> by the <unk> of <unk>, and <unk> in the <unk> <unk>.
It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that <unk> the <unk> of a system like this is the number of <unk> on your screen at any time. It's also a very <unk> architecture.
This is a whole book, example, data not of images.
This is the <unk> <unk> <unk>. Every <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk>.
And to <unk> that it's <unk> and not of images, we can do something like that, to actually show that it's a real <unk> of the text, not of a picture.
It could be a <unk> way to read a book.
I don't like it.
This is a more <unk> example. This is a number of 99.
Every image is the <unk> of a <unk>.
And it really gives you the <unk> and the beautiful experience of the real <unk> version of a <unk> or a <unk>, which is for nature, a <unk> kind of half a half a half a half a half a half a half a half a half a half half a half a half a half a half a half a half a half a half a half a half a half a half a half a half a half of half a half of half, which is, or a
We also did something with the corner of this particular number of 99.
We created a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> much than what you use in a normal <unk>, and we have <unk> you <unk>.
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk>, you can see it here.
Or other models, or even <unk> <unk>.
And this really <unk> some of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of space on the screen.
And I think this <unk> <unk> to <unk> and other <unk> like that, we don't have to be <unk>.
Of course, <unk> is one of the most <unk> <unk> <unk> for this kind of technology.
And I don't want to lose time, if not to say we have <unk> <unk> to give it in this field.
These are all the streets in the U.S. <unk> <unk> above a NASA <unk>.
So now I'm going to go to something else.
This is actually in live in live in the web; you can see it.
It's a project called <unk>, which <unk> two different technologies.
One is <unk> and the other is a <unk> <unk> computer, which is a <unk> <unk> <unk>, a <unk> student of the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And it's alive in the web, <unk> by <unk>.
You can see when we do this kind of <unk>, where we can go from an image to the other and have this kind of experience <unk> <unk>.
But the <unk> <unk> of images here has actually <unk>.
<unk> <unk> of the computer <unk> have <unk> these images together, so that we can <unk> to the <unk> <unk> all <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> have been <unk>. Here you see some <unk> of a <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk>, and these things have all <unk>.
I don't know if I've been to show you some other environment.
There are much more <unk>.
I want to go directly to one of the <unk> of the <unk> data and this <unk> from a <unk> <unk> of <unk> that we've done for the first time, I'm going to show you what <unk> is really the key behind this technology, the <unk> technology. And it's not so much <unk> by looking at the <unk> that we have in the website.
We had to <unk> some <unk> <unk> and out of it.
This is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> images from <unk>. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> of <unk> and <unk> and <unk> of <unk> and so on. And so on. <unk> <unk> <unk> a picture that's discovery.
So, they're all <unk> images and you're all <unk> at the <unk> level like this.
And you can <unk> it in this <unk> way.
You know, I would never have thought of <unk> to work.
It's very <unk> to <unk> this kind of <unk> here.
I think you can see that it's a lot of different <unk>: from those cell cell phones to <unk>, a number of <unk>, <unk>, a number of <unk>, <unk> together in this environment.
And if I can, I can try and look at those <unk>.
Many are <unk> by <unk>, etc.
<unk> here is a series of photographs -- <unk>.
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We can go from <unk> to the physical <unk> of this environment.
The <unk> point is that we can do things with social environment. This is now <unk> data from the <unk> memory of how to <unk> the earth, from the <unk> <unk> and <unk> all that data together.
All those pictures become <unk> together, more than the <unk> of the parts.
You have a <unk> model of the entire <unk>.
Think of this as <unk> of <unk>'s work on Earth.
It's something that <unk> <unk> as people <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, and the <unk> <unk> with the use.
They have pictures of <unk> with <unk> <unk> by other people.
If somebody comes to <unk> the idea of <unk> all these <unk> <unk> <unk>, my <unk> picture of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> all of that data, and I can use it as a <unk> point in that space, in that <unk>, using the pictures of anyone, and have a social experience of <unk> and <unk>.
Of course, a <unk> of all of that are <unk> <unk> of every interesting part of the earth, <unk> not only from <unk> <unk> and images and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> images and <unk> and <unk>.
Thank you very much.
CA: I understood? What's your software <unk> us to do is that software <unk> us to do is, at some point, in the next few years, all the <unk> <unk> to anyone in the world to anyone in the entire world will be <unk> together?
<unk>: Yeah. What's doing is <unk> to find.
It's creating <unk>, if you want, between images.
And it's doing it on the content of images.
The thing becomes very interesting if you think of <unk> information that many of these <unk> images.
As you do a <unk> <unk> and <unk> on the web, you <unk> a <unk> and the page on the page has a lot of information about the images.
Now, what happens if that picture <unk> all of your picture?
So the amount of <unk> <unk> and the amount of <unk> <unk> is really enormous. It's a <unk> <unk> of the network.
CA: <unk>, it's really amazing.
<unk>: I'm going to <unk> you.
One of the main <unk> when you <unk> and one of the <unk> research is that we can live in the <unk> <unk>, who has no <unk> <unk>, in the past <unk>, <unk> it into the <unk> <unk> of plants.
You might think that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, or that <unk> <unk> <unk>, or <unk>, <unk> <unk> are still <unk> <unk> <unk>, or <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and the idea that the world we live in in the <unk>, to <unk> the <unk> of <unk>, and that the idea that the world we live in in which we don't exist in any sense, but it's just a model of the world,
the <unk> of one particular <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> that our <unk> has done, <unk> or bad, a lot of <unk> it.
And, of course, all <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>. <unk>.
We're <unk> to <unk>.
We have to <unk> the <unk> of death <unk>, so we don't know if we could <unk> and <unk> --
We have a art.
What <unk> is the <unk> <unk> of the song, the <unk> of every culture.
It doesn't matter whether it's the <unk> of <unk>, or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk>, <unk> <unk>, or a <unk> in <unk> <unk>, or a <unk> in the heart of <unk>.
He was my <unk> <unk> <unk>, a month ago, or a <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk>, on <unk>, the <unk> mother of the world.
All of these <unk> <unk> us that are other ways of <unk> to think, other ways of to think, other ways of moving in the world.
And if you take a second, it's a concept that can give you hope.
<unk>, the <unk> of the world create a <unk> of life and <unk> that <unk> the planet and it's important for the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> note as <unk>.
And you can think of this <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and you can <unk> the <unk> of all the <unk>, the <unk> of all the <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, ideas, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> to be from from the human imagination of <unk>.
The <unk> is the <unk> <unk> of humanity.
It's the <unk> of what we are and what we can be as as as <unk> species.
And <unk> <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, for example, <unk> that 50 percent of all species has been or is on the <unk> of <unk>, because it's <unk>, or <unk> <unk> -- in the <unk> of <unk> diversity -- and you don't even have to the <unk> <unk> <unk> -- that of the <unk> diversity.
The <unk> of this is, of course, the <unk> <unk>.
When you're <unk> <unk> <unk> on this planet.
A language is not just a <unk> or from a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
A language is the <unk> of the human spirit.
It's the middle of which the <unk> of every culture comes into the world.
Every language is a forest of the mind, a <unk>, a <unk> of <unk>.
And of those <unk> <unk>, while we're sitting here at least, half half is not <unk> in the <unk> of children.
They're no longer <unk> to children, which means to say, unless you know something, which are already death.
What's more <unk> than the <unk> of being <unk> by the <unk>, to be the last one language, to <unk> the language of <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of <unk> <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of the children?
This <unk> <unk> was a <unk> of somebody in the world every two weeks: every two weeks a <unk> <unk> and <unk> with it, <unk> the <unk> <unk> of a language.
And I know that some of you know, "<unk>'t it better?
The world would not be a better place if we could all <unk>? "<unk>, then we talk about <unk>.
<unk> <unk>.
<unk> of a <unk> thing means that we can't speak their language.
I'd like to give you a journey of journey through the <unk> --
a small journey in the <unk> to give you a <unk> of what we're <unk>.
Many of us <unk> that when I say, "I mean," I really mean, "I really mean different ways of <unk>.
So, for example, this <unk> <unk>, in <unk> <unk>, which <unk> <unk> <unk> from the river <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
It's a <unk> that's not able to <unk> the blue color from green because the green <unk> is <unk> in the <unk> time in the forest, where the <unk>.
They have a <unk> language and a rule <unk>, <unk> <unk>. "You have to <unk> a person <unk> <unk> a different language.
And all that <unk> in the past <unk> is that in these <unk> families that they talk about six or seven <unk> because of the <unk> <unk> <unk> no <unk>.
They start to listen and then <unk> to talk.
I <unk> one of the most interesting <unk> I've lived with, the <unk> <unk> <unk>, an amazing <unk> that had the first <unk> in <unk>.
In <unk> five <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
They've made <unk> from the top photographs that <unk> them in <unk>, <unk> that this <unk> of the <unk> forest had never seen anything.
They <unk> the picture of the ground, they <unk> it to a <unk> or a <unk> and, not <unk>, no <unk>, no <unk>, they <unk> the five <unk> with the <unk>.
But <unk> don't just <unk> the <unk>.
They're <unk> to.
<unk> percent of the <unk> was <unk> by themselves.
We went to eight <unk> and we found two <unk> of death, and when we <unk> to know, they <unk> that one of them was so <unk> died, and then <unk> it. And then they <unk> it. And then they <unk> it. And then they <unk> it.
The <unk> were able to recognize the animal <unk> by 40 <unk> and <unk> species.
I first first, 80, I was <unk> a very interesting task when my <unk> <unk> <unk> me if I wanted to go to <unk> <unk> if I wanted to go to <unk> between society at the base of the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk>. And I was used to use <unk>.
And to give a sense of <unk>, I should understand <unk> culture and the <unk> is not <unk> <unk>.
It's kind of a <unk> view of the world.
<unk> interesting.
If you <unk> to <unk> the world's great <unk>, what would you like to me?
<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, etc.
A continent comes out of it, thinking that Africa doesn't have <unk> <unk>. And instead of the <unk> is not else that the <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
What makes interesting is the <unk> relationship between life and death.
So <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> can be <unk> by the <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the live <unk> and <unk> to the <unk> of the live in so that for a little bit of <unk> <unk>.
So, in the <unk> <unk> to say, "<unk> go to speak of God.
We <unk> in <unk> and <unk> God. "
And when you're <unk>, is the spirit that <unk> you, how do you can <unk> you <unk>?
So, you <unk> to these incredible events: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> a rather <unk> of the power of the mind when it's <unk> in a state of <unk> <unk>.
I've been <unk> with the <unk> that I've lived with the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, in <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that once <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk>.
In a <unk> continent of blood, this <unk> never been <unk> by <unk>.
In <unk> today, I'm <unk> by a <unk>, but their education is extraordinary <unk>.
The young <unk> are <unk> away from <unk> to <unk> <unk>, and live in a world <unk> and <unk> in a world <unk> and <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> for 18 years.
Two <unk> of nine years <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>.
For this time, they come up with the values of their society, values that their <unk> <unk> and only their <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or to say <unk> <unk>.
At the end of this incredible <unk>, they <unk> out and the first time in their life, at 18 years, they see a <unk>. And in that moment of the first <unk>, when the sun <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk>, everything that they have learned in the theory of his <unk>. The <unk> does a <unk> <unk> <unk>, everything that they have learned in <unk> theory. The <unk> does a step back and says.
"<unk>? I'm going to tell you.
It's <unk>. Now it's about you <unk>. "
They call <unk> <unk> and they say that we, <unk> <unk>, we are the <unk> of the world.
This <unk> level is extremely important.
When we think of <unk> <unk> and the <unk> environment and the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, which is a <unk> concept in its <unk> or maybe <unk> <unk> and say that these <unk> are <unk> <unk> to the Earth.
The <unk> <unk> are not <unk> or <unk> by <unk>.
There's no space for these things in the <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk>, but by the time and <unk>, have created a <unk> of Earth <unk>, not on the concept of <unk> <unk> <unk>. But on a <unk> <unk> <unk>, the concept of the Earth can only live because it is <unk> by the human consciousness.
What does that mean?
Let me say that a <unk> of the mountain <unk> that <unk> is a <unk> <unk> <unk> its <unk> will be <unk> <unk>. And it will be a human being <unk> <unk> different. And it will be <unk> different with the mountain or the <unk> of <unk> that <unk> <unk> that a mountain is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> to be <unk>.
<unk> is <unk> of a spirit or a <unk> <unk> is <unk>.
What's interesting is the <unk> that <unk> the relationship between <unk> and natural world.
I grew up in the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> to be <unk>.
That made me a human being <unk> by my friends who believe that <unk> are the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> that live in the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
If we start <unk> that these <unk> can actually create different <unk>, we start understanding some of their <unk> <unk>.
I <unk> this picture in <unk> in <unk> <unk>.
Maybe some of you have heard about <unk>, the most powerful <unk> <unk> of <unk>.
What makes <unk> is not the potential of <unk>, but its <unk>. It's <unk> by two elements.
On one side, this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
<unk> the <unk> is a <unk> <unk> that <unk> a little bit, <unk>, but it's <unk> with <unk> of a <unk> <unk>'s family <unk> <unk>.
This <unk> <unk> <unk>, very similar to <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
If you'll see <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> that <unk> on the <unk> is a bit of like being <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a sea of electricity. It doesn't make a <unk> of reality of reality.
I often was with my <unk>, Richard <unk> <unk>, the man who <unk> the <unk> was <unk>, with its discovery of the <unk> <unk> <unk> in the '<unk>.
And my <unk> you can't <unk> these <unk> as <unk> because if you can't tell anybody to be <unk>. <unk> <unk>, but they can't be <unk> because they're <unk> by a <unk> that's <unk>, of course in <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
It's possible to <unk> only if you could <unk> with other <unk> <unk> that <unk>.
Now, the <unk>: the <unk> that are in this <unk> are <unk>, <unk> <unk>, the same kind of necessary to <unk> <unk>. The question <unk> <unk>: in a <unk> of <unk> species of plants, how these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> two <unk>, not like this but that if they <unk> in this way, they create a <unk> that's <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk>?
We use the great <unk> of <unk> and <unk>, that can <unk> <unk>.
But if you go to the <unk>, we <unk> "The plants talk about it."
What does that mean?
This <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, who <unk> <unk> in the forest, and that our eyes <unk> in the same species.
If you know how they <unk> their <unk> <unk> us, "<unk> <unk> of plants, and you don't know everything?" I said, "No."
The solution is: you take <unk> <unk> into a night night and <unk> with a different <unk>.
And with this is not going to <unk>, but it's much more interesting than <unk> <unk>.
Now, the problem is that even those of us who have heart <unk> <unk> them, but somehow <unk> to the <unk> of history of history as much as our real world, and <unk> it.
In fact, the <unk> century, <unk>, not <unk> <unk> for its <unk> or its <unk> <unk>, but rather like the age of was that we <unk> and <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> diversity and <unk> and <unk> the <unk> of the planet. Now the problem is not the change.
All the <unk> through <unk> have been <unk> in a <unk> for new possibility of life.
And the problem is not technology.
<unk> <unk> have no <unk> to be <unk> when they put <unk> <unk> and <unk> as much as the <unk> have not <unk> to be <unk> when they put <unk> <unk> and <unk>.
It's not the change or technology that <unk> <unk>. It's the power.
The <unk> <unk> of <unk>.
And if you look at a look at the world, I would say that these are not <unk> <unk>.
They're <unk> creatures and <unk> out of the <unk> forces that go beyond their <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> --
a <unk> <unk> of <unk>, in <unk> <unk>, a <unk> who lived <unk> in the forest until a generation ago, and now we're going to <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk>, where you can see the <unk> <unk> from the <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk>,
I started <unk> with <unk> <unk> with the forest <unk> <unk>.
Or, in the case of <unk>, are the <unk> of the <unk> discovery.
If you take a <unk> of the <unk>, where I'm doing a lot of research, you'll see the <unk> of the political <unk>.
As a <unk>, <unk> physics of a <unk>, is <unk> at the <unk> of a <unk>, but the <unk>, the <unk> of life <unk>, not only is not <unk>, but but <unk> <unk> <unk> in certain <unk>, because it's part of the development of development.
And you can't understand the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> until you go from the beginning.
I've been <unk> miles from <unk> in the <unk> <unk>, <unk> to <unk> with a young <unk>, but only <unk> to <unk> it, I realized what's behind.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> million people <unk> from the <unk> <unk> during the <unk> <unk>.
The father of this guy was <unk> to the <unk> <unk>.
That means that it's been <unk> at the <unk> of Chinese <unk>.
<unk> <unk> is <unk> with <unk> <unk> during the <unk> that led the <unk> <unk>.
My mother was <unk> and his <unk> was to be <unk>.
It was taken by <unk> in <unk> at age two <unk> <unk> under his <unk> because he couldn't have to live without him.
The <unk>, who did the same, was <unk> in <unk>.
One day <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> and, for this <unk>, was <unk> to the <unk> jobs for seven years.
The <unk> pain can be <unk>, but the <unk> spirit of <unk> is from <unk> present.
At the end, all of it <unk> to a choice.
Do you live in the world's <unk> or we want to <unk> the world of diversity?
The great <unk> <unk> <unk>, before he died said that his greatest fear was was that, in our <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that we were other <unk>.
And it's <unk> to remember that our species is <unk> for <unk> years.
The <unk> <unk>, who gave us agriculture, which <unk> us, which <unk> us to <unk>, <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> with the <unk> of <unk>, and we talk about <unk> years ago.
The world <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And that <unk> story I don't like we have the answers to all the challenges that we could <unk> in the <unk> to come.
When these <unk> of <unk> <unk> world is what they want to be human, <unk> with <unk> <unk>.
And it's in these answers that we all <unk> the possibility of being what we are: a <unk> species, which has to <unk>, which has to <unk> all the <unk> and all the <unk> can <unk>. And there are great moments of <unk>.
I took this picture on the north <unk> of <unk>, when I went to <unk> with <unk>, and this man, <unk> me the wonderful story of his <unk>.
The <unk> government was not always <unk> with <unk> <unk> and in the '<unk> to <unk> our <unk>, we <unk> them.
The <unk> of this man <unk> <unk>.
The family, <unk> for his life, <unk> <unk> all the <unk>, and all his <unk>.
You want to know that <unk> don't <unk> the cold, we'll <unk> it.
The <unk> of <unk> <unk> fish were made <unk> fish <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> of this man didn't <unk> from night or <unk> <unk>.
It's <unk> away, it <unk> the <unk> <unk> into your hand. When I did it <unk>, they <unk> it into your hand. When I did it <unk>, he <unk> it up with a <unk>.
He <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk> of <unk> and when <unk>, <unk>, <unk> a dog.
He <unk> the dog and created a <unk>, with the <unk> <unk> created a <unk>, <unk> a <unk>, <unk> a <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
<unk> to talk about nothing? [<unk>] And this, in different ways, [<unk>] is the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and all the <unk> <unk> of the world.
<unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> government <unk> to <unk> the total of <unk> area of an area of bigger <unk> in California and <unk>.
It's their new <unk>. It's called <unk>.
It's a <unk> <unk>. <unk> all the resources <unk>.
One example of how a <unk> can <unk> with his <unk>.
And, finally, I think it's kind of <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> areas of the planet, <unk> that they don't have.
For somebody is home.
<unk> <unk> of human imagination that <unk> to <unk> <unk>. And for all of us, the dreams of these children, like our children of these children, they become part of the <unk> of hope.
And so, we <unk> <unk>, we are <unk> that <unk> never <unk> to anything.
I would say that <unk> --
[<unk>] They're not <unk>, but we believe that stories can change the world, and maybe we're the best <unk> to tell the stories of the world. Every month our website <unk> <unk> <unk> million <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> our <unk> <unk>.
Our <unk> are <unk> by millions of people.
Our work is <unk> in <unk> to bring our public to <unk> our public in places to <unk> <unk> from which <unk> <unk> from how they saw and, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> for time time time <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in diversity, and we have to find a <unk> <unk> world. And we have to find a <unk> <unk> <unk>. And we have to find a <unk> <unk> world.
where the <unk> of all <unk> can <unk> our <unk> <unk>.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some things I wrote in this book I hope to <unk> you've heard and <unk> some <unk>, in the case you don't <unk> them.
I'd like to start with what I call "the <unk> <unk>."
The <unk> <unk> of what?
The <unk> <unk> of all <unk> society. The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>: "If we want to <unk> the <unk> of our citizens" The way to do it is <unk> freedom to <unk>. "
The reason is, on one side, in fact that the freedom is in itself, is <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> for humans.
<unk> is the other one is that if we're <unk>, each of us can act to do everything that <unk> our <unk>, without any one of us in the name of our.
The way to <unk> the freedom is to <unk> choice.
More choices people, more <unk> are <unk>, and more and more and more and more their <unk>, is their <unk>.
This, <unk>, is so <unk> <unk> <unk> in society that nobody <unk> to <unk>.
And it's also <unk> <unk> in our lives.
I'm going to show you some examples of what progress made made.
This is my <unk>. It's not particularly big.
I'm going to <unk> a simple note on the <unk> to <unk>.
In my <unk>, there are <unk> <unk>, without <unk> the 10 <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that you can buy for you a huge number of <unk> in the <unk> <unk> that nobody of the <unk> already, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, which nobody of the <unk> already.
Here's what <unk> is.
Then you go to the <unk> <unk> to buy a <unk>: <unk>, <unk> <unk>, radio, <unk>, <unk>.
And in this single <unk> store, there's a lot of <unk> <unk>.
We can make six and a half million different <unk> using the <unk> that there are in one store.
<unk> <unk> that there is <unk> choice.
<unk>: the world of <unk>.
Once, when I was a child, you could get all the <unk> <unk>, to <unk> that were <unk> by <unk> <unk>.
You <unk> the phone, you don't <unk> it.
One of that, in the other, was that the phone would never <unk>.
These days, they went.
We have a <unk> <unk> <unk>, especially between <unk>. <unk> <unk>.
Here's cell phones in the future.
My <unk> is in the middle, <unk> <unk>, <unk>, and <unk> <unk>.
If you don't have it yet seen in the <unk> store, you're <unk> that soon you're going to be <unk>.
And what is at the end of it is that people <unk> to <unk> and <unk> this question. And you know, what about is the answer? The answer is, "No."
You can't buy a cell phone phone that doesn't make things.
So in other <unk> of life that are much more important than <unk>, <unk>, <unk> the same <unk> of choices.
<unk> <unk>: It doesn't happen in the United States you're going to <unk> you what you have to do.
Instead, I went from <unk>, and the <unk> tells you, "OK, we could do it." And he's got these <unk> and these <unk>. "" "" <unk> has these <unk> and these <unk>. "What do you want to do?"
You said, "<unk>, what do you want to do?"
And the <unk> says, "<unk> has these <unk> and these <unk>, and <unk> <unk>."
"What do you want to do?"
And you said, "<unk> if she was me, what would you like?"
And the <unk> said, "But I'm not her."
The <unk> we call it "<unk> <unk>," <unk> "," <unk> "," <unk> "," <unk> "."
But in fact, it's not a <unk> the weight and the responsibility of the <unk> of the <unk>, to <unk>, to <unk>, somebody who don't know -- and of course it's <unk> -- and so it doesn't have to make the patient.
There's a huge <unk> of <unk>, <unk> to people like me and you, that if you think about it has no sense, because we can't <unk>.
But if we can't <unk>, why do we <unk> them?
The answer is they want you to call the <unk> to <unk> <unk>.
<unk> so fundamental as it is our <unk> <unk> is a matter of choice, how you can see in this <unk>. "We don't want to <unk> kids. We don't want to <unk> the kids." We don't get any longer. We have to <unk>.
And we can <unk> how many times we <unk>.
That means that every <unk>, you have to decide that kind of person you want to be.
I went to the family and <unk>, a common time perspective, <unk> almost anyone, was that was that <unk> you as possible, and <unk> to <unk> to the kids as possible.
The only real choice was with who, not when, and they don't even know what to do after.
<unk>, it's really to play.
They start to very smart students, and they <unk> their 20 percent, <unk>,
And not because they're not <unk>, not because they're <unk>.
but why they're <unk>, <unk> <unk>, "<unk> <unk> or not?"
"<unk> I'm going to be later? I've got to think before or <unk>?"
I'm <unk> <unk>.
And they try to answer these questions, even if this <unk> doesn't <unk> the <unk> that <unk> and not get a <unk> <unk> to my <unk>.
And they need to do that. They're important questions.
Now, the work is we're <unk>, as <unk> <unk>, because technology <unk> us to work every minute, every day, on the planet, <unk> that from the <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, there's a <unk>, and I'm not going to tell anybody where it works.
I don't tell you, because I want to use it.
What does this mean, this incredible freedom of choice we have about the work? Is we need to decide, <unk> at any time, if we need to work or not.
We can go to see our son to play <unk>, with a cell phone, <unk> in a <unk>, the other, and the <unk>, <unk>.
And even if I'm all <unk>, every minute we see our son, I'm going to <unk>, "Do I have to <unk> this call?"
"I have to answer this <unk>? I have to <unk> this letter?"
And even when the answer is, "not," that makes the experience of your son very different from what would be in other conditions.
So, from any part of it, little, little objects and big objects, life is a matter of choices.
Once the world was this: <unk>, there were some chance, but it wasn't about choice.
The world today's <unk> to this: The <unk> is, "Is it going to be, or <unk>?"
The answer is <unk>.
So, <unk> <unk>, we know, so I'm going to talk about <unk>.
<unk> that choice would <unk> two effects of people.
The first, <unk>, is that it <unk> instead of <unk>.
With a lot of <unk> between which you choose, it becomes very difficult to do.
I'm going to give you one example, <unk> <unk> <unk>.
A <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, with about a million <unk> <unk>, with about a million <unk> <unk> in different companies.
What she discovered is that for every 10 <unk> that are <unk> in more, the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> two percent.
With 50 <unk> <unk>, there's 10 percent less than when they are available available. Why?
Because with 50 <unk> <unk> that you have to decide, and <unk> it's <unk> to decide and choice is <unk>.
And <unk>, and still <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and of course <unk>, and <unk> never <unk>.
<unk> that means that these <unk> <unk> <unk> food for <unk> because they don't have enough money, it means that the decision <unk> is so <unk> that they also <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
They're not going to be <unk> to <unk> <unk> for year from work, which would be <unk> to <unk>.
So <unk> is a <unk> of <unk> choice.
And I think that's going to be <unk> the world.
"And finally, for <unk>: <unk>, <unk> or <unk>?"
You want to take the right decision, if it's for <unk>, right?
You don't want to choose the wrong end, and <unk> the wrong <unk>.
So this is the first effect. The second is that even if we can <unk> <unk> and make a choice, at the end, we're less <unk> by the result of how we <unk> have been with less <unk> by the <unk> of how to <unk> <unk>.
And that's for different reasons.
One of them is that with many <unk> of which <unk>, if you <unk> one and it's not perfect, it's easy to imagine that they could have been a different choice. And what happens is that the <unk> <unk> <unk> us to <unk> of choice, and the <unk> <unk> by <unk> decision.
even when it was a <unk> decision.
More choices there are, <unk>, <unk> it's easier to <unk> than any <unk> <unk>.
<unk>, there's what <unk> call.
Dan <unk> has <unk> very well as the value that we give to things that we give things to what <unk>.
<unk>, when there are many <unk> of them, it's easy to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and being <unk> and <unk> <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> is.
Here's one example. I'm going to <unk> with everyone who are not in New York.
But that's what you probably know.
There's this <unk> to the <unk>.
A <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>. <unk> day. It's all about it.
I don't know anything. But what he thinks, "Well, <unk>, it's <unk>."
"All my <unk> <unk> are away."
"<unk> <unk> right in front of the house."
And it goes two weeks, I'm going to go out -- every day -- the chance of <unk> where it wants.
The <unk> <unk> <unk> for what we have, even when choice was <unk>.
And the <unk> we have from <unk>, the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> us to <unk>.
Here's another example.
This <unk> tells us a lot of things.
It's about living the moment, and maybe it's not going to live slowly.
But the most important thing is that anything you would like, you know, you're going to <unk>, you're going to be able to do other.
The things that don't have many <unk> that can make less <unk> what we do.
<unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk>.
I tried it on my skin <unk> a new couple of <unk>.
I'm going to be <unk>.
Once the <unk> were one, they were <unk>, and they were <unk>, only after <unk> <unk> a life <unk>, and they were <unk>, only after <unk> a life <unk> and <unk> a lot of times, I was going to go well.
So, I went to <unk> a couple of when the <unk> <unk>, and I said, "I need a couple of <unk>, this is my <unk>."
The <unk> said, "Do you want to <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>?"
You want them to <unk> or <unk>? "
"Do them want to <unk>?"
"<unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk>? <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>."
I was <unk>, and after a little bit of <unk>, and I was able to say, "I want the <unk> guy," He had no idea what was, so for one time, I <unk> it, and I got off the <unk>, <unk>, and then I was <unk> <unk>, and then I had ever <unk>.
It was the <unk>. With all that choice I had <unk> the best.
But it <unk> me worse.
Why? I wrote a whole book for <unk>.
The reason I was worse is that with all that choice my <unk> were <unk>, the <unk> <unk> to be <unk>.
I had <unk> <unk>. I didn't know anything about <unk> when I only had one guy, but when I had 100 different, it would have to be perfect.
What I was <unk> was good, but I didn't like perfect.
After I went on to the <unk> that I was <unk> in <unk>.
The <unk> of <unk> in life doesn't make <unk> <unk> that these <unk>, as they <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> themselves.
And this <unk> <unk>, even when the results are good.
<unk> in the world of <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Because if I <unk> it, I don't know what I'm talking about.
The truth is going to be more to this.
"It was better when you were worse when you were worse when you were worse, when you know, was worse, when you know, it was worse than when you were worse was <unk>.
<unk>, in the world that we live -- <unk>, <unk> citizens with the <unk> of <unk> -- the <unk> that we can <unk> is that things are at the <unk> of <unk>.
You never have to <unk> <unk> because your <unk>, my <unk>, <unk>.
The <unk> of happiness -- what you're here -- is, "<unk> <unk>" Yes, "<unk> <unk>" Yes, you want it. "
I mean -- little <unk> moment -- I'm really <unk> and my wife is really <unk>.
I couldn't do it, I couldn't <unk> it.
But <unk> doesn't always have a <unk> thing.
<unk>, a <unk> of <unk> <unk> when there's only that kind of <unk> is that when you're not <unk>, and you say, "Why?"
"Who is <unk>?" "<unk> is <unk>.
The world is <unk>. What could I do do?
When there are hundreds of types of <unk>, and I'm going to <unk> a <unk>, and I'm going to tell you who is the <unk>, it's clear that the <unk> you are.
They could have done better.
With hundreds of <unk> available, there are not <unk> for <unk>.
So when people make decisions, even if it's <unk>, you <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> the <unk> to them.
In the last few years, <unk> is <unk> in the world.
I think a <unk> <unk> -- not the only, but important -- of this <unk> of <unk> is that people have experiences because the standard are too <unk>.
And when they have to <unk> that they think that <unk> is they.
So the final result is that we're better, we're going to <unk>, but we <unk> worse.
Let me tell you.
This is the <unk> <unk>, what we take for all for for good and it's completely <unk>.
There's no <unk> that a little bit of choice is better than <unk>, but at all of this is not a lot of choice is a little bit better than that it is.
There's a <unk> value, I don't know what it is.
But I'm sure we've <unk> by a piece of the level in which the choices <unk> our life.
Now, from a <unk> <unk> -- I've almost finished -- from the <unk>'s point of view, <unk> is <unk>.
What it allows all this choice in society is the <unk> material.
There are many places in the world, and you know, <unk> <unk>, where the problem is not that they have <unk> choice.
The problem is they have too much <unk>.
So the <unk> I'm talking about is a <unk> <unk> of <unk>, <unk> society.
And what <unk> does and <unk> is this: <unk> <unk> <unk> talked to you yesterday about how much those <unk> and <unk> <unk> to <unk> are <unk>. It's a <unk> of money.
I mean that these choices, <unk> and <unk>, it's not that they're just <unk>.
I'm <unk> <unk>.
They're doing it.
If a little bit of what we could have <unk> choice was <unk> in those where people have too much <unk>, it would not be their life to <unk>, but our.
This is what <unk> call a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
A <unk> of income <unk> all -- not just to poor -- because of this choice in <unk> that we have.
And so I'll <unk>, you can become everything you want to --
<unk>, people of culture, <unk>, "What do that fish?"
"It's <unk> that you can't make anything in a glass <unk>."
"A <unk>, a <unk> view of the world --"
and I <unk> it like this, I <unk>.
But then, I'm <unk>, I realized that the fish knows that that the long knows.
Because the reality of <unk> is that if you <unk> <unk> the <unk>, so that "is possible" you can't <unk> the freedom.
If you <unk> the <unk> so that it would <unk> to <unk> the <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk>.
They need a <unk>.
This is almost of course too <unk>, maybe even for the fish, and certainly for us.
But the <unk> of a few <unk> <unk> is a <unk> <unk> and, <unk>, for <unk>.
Thank you very much.
