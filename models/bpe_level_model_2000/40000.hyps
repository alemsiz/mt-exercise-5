And last year, I showed these slides to demonstrate that the type of artical artical tears for almost three million years had had the sizes of 40 million years has had the size.
But this substituts the gravity of the problem because it doesn't show the ice of the ice.
The artyal climbs is, in a certain sense, the heart of the global climate system.
You expand it from the wversumer and I returned out of the summer.
The next slide will be a quick repid on the last 25 years.
The lost lost are reports in red red it.
As you see it bels to the blue scream.
That's the ice in winter winter that you return out of the summer.
You can see that the ice called the glacious glace, five years or more, it's like the blood that five years or more, is like the sheet.
In 25 years was spent from like this, at the time.
This is a problem because the interests is that interests the ground around the ocean to the articate land around the ocean that are remained in the ocean that melt that sheet -- they come transformed by microbies.
Ripe the totality of the atmospheric income from global warming, that amount could double pollution, surround this point of not return to the point of not return to the point of not return to the point of the pollution.
In some lakes in some laka foot in Alaska metan already care already bubbling from water.
The professored Katey Walter University of Alaska has recated team was recated with a team in the winter.
Video: Wow! At the question, it's good. She's got the question.
A reason that this is that this termac exchange in surrises of the Greenland from the north.
This is a glacial regime glacial regime
The taken had never reached levels like that.
This is the Kangerland-east Kangerlands in the Greenland of the Greenland
If you want to know how the ski level of the sea level of the level of the lands on land here is where the sea of sket.
These corrups are increasing rapidly.
Another part of the planet: Antartic, the largest block of the planet.
The last month, the scientists have declared that the balance of the ice, and that the ice of the ice, and that Antarts, that the Western Antarts, which is particularly rapid in the sheet.
And what's a six feet of water levels like in Greenland in Greenland in Greenland in Greenland in Greenland in Greenland in Greenland six feet in Genland like in Genland in Genland in Greenland in the water of water --
On Himalaya, the third largest block of ice block and a few years aghi, who was a few years ago were ice.
The 40 percent of the world received half of the retain from the retailable water from the reeffort water from the release.
Sulle Ande: this glacier is the source of water this city.
The doors is increased.
But when he diminishes the same ack water water pocrashes.
In California the snow on Sierra Nevada is declined 40 percent.
The idrich ydros are in crisis.
The predictions -- like you have a bad -- are graves.
The growing security in the world door to a remarkable increasings.
The environmental disasters are increasing to a return out of the normal and without previous precedent.
Four times more than in the last 30 years of respect to the previous 75.
This is a whole thing of unsustainable.
If you look at it in the history if you can see the consequences.
In the last five years we added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the oceans every day.
Look at the East area of the oriental Pacific Pacific America, and the wests of the continent of Indian Indian from the continent of the continent of the oceans.
The greatest warming, together with deforestation, together with deforestation, which is 20 percent, is the use of fuels of fossil fuels are us.
oil is a problem, and the carbon is even worse.
The United States are one of the two countries, together, together to China.
And it proposed to build a lot of other centers in a carbon.
But we're going to see a shift change.
These are the annulled projects in the last few years and some alternative proposes.
Anyway, there's a lot of political in our country.
The carbon and oil industries have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote the carbon and promote chpull carbon that is a hoxymor.
This picture is reminded me to remind me of it.
Veroice, in Tennessee, where there's been a 3.8 billion gap choories of choories of carbon dies of carbon dies.
You saw that you saw about news.
This is the second largest flower of scories in America.
It was around Natal.
The natalizes of one of the carbon industries was thise.
Video: He'd be a half, and I have carbon is a half like and happy.
It's a degree in America, and it grows our economy.
Frosty carbonian is increasingly clean.
It's a good price, lovelable, and workers keep the stipendent stypend.
Al Gore: From here is a lot of the West Virginia.
The largest societies on mountains is Massey Coal. This is his administrator.
Video: Don Blankh: I'm going to be clear -- Al Gore, Nancy Pelosii, Harry Reid -- they don't know what they're talking about.
Al Gore: So the Allance for Proteon the Proteon launched two countries.
This is one of it.
Video: All right, we see the COALery see the climate changes like a threats of our business.
So our priorities is to invest a great amount of money in a public efforce to make public and reconfused the verity of carbon.
In fact, the carbon is not sport.
We think it's clean -- has a good profum.
So not predictor of climate change.
Let me do that.
Video: All right: Carbone clean -- you heard a lot of it.
So let's take a gyp around a structure for how much about the clean to the clean to the clean or carbon dish.
Straordinary machines are a little noisy, but this is the sound of the technology.
The carbon is between the major causes of the main warming, but the remarkable technology of carbon technology -- but the remarkable technology that you can see change.
Go a look at a glapping technology.
Al Gore: Infinally, positive alternative alternative to the economic securitself and the national securition.
Video: Here is in crisi; America, the economy, the national security climate climate climate crisis.
The film that college college all of it, our dependence by fossil fuels -- like the dirty carbon and oil care and the important.
Now, there's a new solution to us.
America: 100-year-old, a clean energy in diet,
They plan to stop America to work out of the work, to help stop, and help stop to the global warming.
Finally, a solution that you have to solve our problems.
Repower America. You buy more.
Al Gore: This is the last time.
Video: He's going energy to America.
One of the fastest ways to take a remodic dependence by combustible combusts our planet.
I realized the future is here. I only only a new energy network, a new energy network.
She brows 2: Novoves investment for places of well-retributed.
All right. It's time to be realists.
Al Gore: A old African proverbable African says, "If you want to go fast from sol.
If you want to go away away from this."
We have to go away away, quickly.
Thank you very much.
The last year at TED fect in the LHC.
And I promise to go back to the way to get to how the machines works the machine.
So here I got here. And for those who the other time there was no her, the LHC is the biggest scientific experiment -- 27 miles of circumstomer is a mile of circumstom.
His comfortable to reremaining the conditions that were less than a billion second from the beginning of the universe -- until 600 million times a second.
This is just environment.
This is the machine underneath Gineva.
We photographs Big Bang Bang Bang Bang Bievators.
This is what I work. It's called ATLAS -- it's largely 44 meters and has a 22 meters.
This is a picture of ATLAS image in ATLAS in building so you can see proportions.
The 10 sectors of the last year we have access the car for the first time.
And this picture was taken by ATLAS.
It was causing of immenses in control.
It's a picture of the first particle of particles that had done all the way around the LHC, entering to collision, and deliberately, to a part of the LHC, and spread particles inside the relayers.
In other words, when we set that imagined the 10 sector of the machines worked on that machine works, which is a great life.
I don't know if it was to do this to experience more opposed to Google and he saw that the beginning was this thing.
That means we had a cultural impact that we had a cultural impact to the scientific impact.
About a week later, it was a problem with the machine, just a problem -- these films here -- these modorates.
These films bring 13,000 printing when the machine works at the most powerful power.
Now, the technical technicals are going to look at films and they say, "It's not true. I'm not true.
And they can do it because when I'm very cold teaching become the cosidy of the superconvictors.
So, at less 271 degrees, to an instop temperature in the stars, these files can bring that corporate rent.
In one of the most of the top of magnets in the LHC, there was a defection defection of factor.
So the films surrise to the rescue and 13,000 printing printing a resistance of electrical resistance.
This was the result.
Now, this is even more impressive if you think that these magnets are more than 20 tons tons, and that have been moved about 30 centimeters.
They are damaged about 50 magnets.
We had to take them to be going to take it, what we did it.
We repristine and reported them and travels.
They're now now now they're going to return out to the ground.
Enthor the end of the LHC will be in new integraph.
We're going to accens and we expect of the data or he goes to go and keep so our adventure to discover what are the matts that are the matts that are the universe.
Now, of course, in a certain way; these crash crash crash care and engineering in frontiere. It's easy to conflict.
I think that it's so difficult to go beyond the limits, I think it's the value of things like LHC.
I want to conclude with the words of a Inglessons of English words that are involved in defense of inuteful inute." And he said, "No clean was Michael Faray, said, "No is so dangerous for progress of the human mind as the rest of the mind of the human mind of the mind of the mind of the mind of the mind of the mind mind of the world as wells us us that we are completely read to the world."
Thank you.
I want to start asking you to rethink about this -- as a children, as a children, playing cooks.
While you can reach them and reaching them and reaching them and reaching them and they move them to think and resolve problems and resolve problems and handing relations.
The space is deeply connected to the way we understand most of the world around us.
So, from inspired by inspired by using physics, together with physics, together to my consultent Pace, and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanith, I started to ask mmyself, I started to asking myself, you use just to have the only copastredigital that we have the only as a gital drink pole that that we can realize information with both of the hands
and to fight it to our please?
The question was so interesting that we decided we decided we would to explore the answer to the answer --
In words, a Siftable computer is a big interactive as a bigger as a couple of words.
In words, a Siftable computer is a big interactive as a bigger as a couple of words.
You can move them with the hand, they can see between them, and they can see their motion and have a wireless.
But more than the point of course, like matter matter objects, you can just rest of them to rest of it.
The Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem for manipulate information for manipulal information
And as they get more physics, and I consciousness of their motion, and as they become more physics, and as they become more physics, and as we can motion, we can explore the other way we can explore new interactions and fundamental style in the interaction.
I'll start with some simple example.
This Siftable is configurated to show vides: if you inct it into a direction, the video will go back to the other side backwards.
These ree recognizes are aware of the other record.
If I do that, you are interested in what they are in the time.
If they come circumstom, and they can wage.
If they come circumstom, and they can wage.
They also have their movement and incline.
And then we realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was able to use communal gestures of the data, for example as if it was a liquid.
In this case, we have three Siftable configurated as seck of green and I can use them to reversy to the color in the central central in that central central central to be mix in the central central central of the color.
and I can use them to go to the color in that central central central where they mix the mix of the central same.
If we can recover, we can reput a little bit of it.
There's also beautiful possibilities of learning, like mathematics and play and logical play and logical play things to try and see the logical results of logical resulted.
I'm going to --
This is a Fibonacus that I do with a program of equations.
Here we have a words that is in half between Scarabeo and Boggle.
As course, to every turn you get a house on every Siftable, Pratically, to every turn of the Siftable, and I received a letter to be able to get words of words on a dictionary.
Then, after about 30 seconds remiss it, and you have a new set of reading and new possibilities and new possibilities to try to properly.
Thank you.
Here's the kids came to the Middle Lab, I did that I tried them and I took them and I took a video.
They are pleasures.
And one of the interesting things about this kind of application is that you don't have to people a lot of education.
You just have to say, "Compons of words, and they know exactly what to do.
Here's some other people who tried it.
This is our younger head than younger and right there.
It actually wanted to be actually going to be crawles.
They were just standing up for him.
Now, this is an application of a interactive cardboard.
We wanted to build a tool to learninguishing Lui is Felix.
It can put new characters in the scene, and retaeving the Siftable their associated associated with them.
It can put new characters in the scene, and retaeving the Siftable their associated associated with them.
So it's doing the sun is doing the sun
Video: The sun is source.
David Merrill: He's taken a treat in the scene.
Video: The treatment of it.
Bel work!
So school and you get the Siftable and it can interact the characters --
Video: Bay!
-- by inventing their story.
Video: Hellaao!
DM: It's a story with final open-open-open-up, and it can decide how you do it.
DM: It's a story with final open-open-open-up, and it can decide how you do it.
Video: Video: Vice,
DM: The last example I have time to show you is a tool, realized recently, to sample and to sample, and to squeezing and music.
It's a recently, realized recently, to sample and to sample and music.
The Siftable here are now from sound like based and battery.
Every one of these has four different variations, and you can choose what to use.
You can inserve these sounds in a sequence to coming in your pleasures.
And it is just making it a sound to touch a sound and a "sequence."
These are actually that you can control from living and filter.
You attack to a particular sound and then including it.
And then there's the general effects as time and volumes, which is applied in the entire sequence.
Let's look like it works.
Video: DM: We're going to start making a base in two Sequence, we can start in a seriously, we get to a series, we go extend.
Now I put a lower of the backs.
Video: DM: Here I add to do --
Video: DM: And I'm going to put the filter to the bacteria, so I can control the effect of live.
Video: DM: I can know how to quickly inclining the entire sequences that are side or from one side or from the other.
Video: DM: And I'm going to add the movie to the based to give more expression.
Video: DM: I can recombining the sequencing of the sequence.
So I didn't have to planning it before, but I can sudden, I can sudden, more or more short or more short or more shorta.
And finally, I can have the whole sequence inclining the whole sequence inclining the left Siftable "volut."
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is building new man-machine interfaces to be more like our brain and more like our brain and body.
And I had time to show you one of the results of this pattern and some of the results that we try to bring out of the lab and some of the lab --
The concept I want to transmit you is that it's coming this new generation of objects to interact with the media digital media that will be information in our world in the way we want to do it.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the hour of talking to all of you.
I'm a writing written --
Scrips is my professional but it's more about this, of course, of course,
It's also the love and the basis of my life.
And I don't expect that it can change it.
But I said, "Well, a particular was recently in my life and career in my life and career that took me to realibrating the entire rely recalibrating to this work.
The particular thing I recently recently this biographer called "Mangia, Prega, Ama" -- and Ama" -- and I became a very very nicon-to-cedentited books, for some reason in the world and became a big -- and it became a big --
And the result is that everywhere from now, people are being coming to me as if I were convicted to me as if I were convicted to me.
It's true -- convict: convict!
They come from me now and they say, "Don't you fear anymore, "Don't you fear anymore.
You can't afraid to write for all life without any life could be able to create a book that can make somebody to make someone?"
that can care somebody to me?"
It's resure that you know.
But it could go worse and I was a lot of that I was 20 years ago, when I started to say to people -- I was an adolescent -- I wanted to be a trick -- I wanted to be a trick of the text of the text of the text I was a writing.
I walk against the same based reaction by fear.
And people said, "Don't get me to have successful?
Don't afraid that the humor you killer you kill you?
You can't fear to do this mester for all life without anything that comes out and die on a seven cumulation of dreams and die to be fallies with the bought to love falliment?"
So you know, you know.
The answer -- the short answer -- "Si."
I have fear of all those things.
I always had to fearlier.
And I also have a lot of other things that people might not have to meet.
As a and other things extremely so.
But as I think about this and I write the I thought and I would ask me really quite the time is?
Is it ration?
It's a logical location that anyone who needs to be scared by a job that I feel feel that I feel feel that you feel to do
But what is so particular in the impresely creative to make us remove to health mental health mental health not do it?
How my father, for example, he was a chemistry and I don't rememistry and I don't rememistry in his 40 years of activity where he was asking if he had to be able if he had to be able if he had to be engineer to be engineer if you could be able if he was fear that capit?
It never had -- that block of John, how do it?
Don't worked, you know?
Enestly, the engineers as group don't have certainly, in centuries, they don't have certainly in centuries to be alcohyacks.
We have enough this reputation -- and not just writers but not just a writers but creative of all kinds of things, we have this reputation of being enormously instable to of the reputation of all that
And it doesn't realize that look at the contains of the magnitude of magnificent creative that only in the wind of the century, they die and often to hold them.
And the ones that they don't have suicidated seem to be really, by their womans.
Norman Mailer, before I die, in the last interview said, "Ogni book me a little more." And I was a little more remarkable to the work of your life.
But we don't have the way we heard about because we heard these things so long than somehow we have these things that we were totally interiorited and accepted the notion that creativity and suffering that the creativity and that arts, and it will always conduct to the anguguy.
And the question I want to ask to all of today, I agree with this ideas?
You go to this -- because even watch this -- because even watch centimeter that is not good for anything this supposed to do nothing this suppose.
I think it's hateful.
And I think it's also dangerous and I don't want to see it in the next century.
I think it's better to encourage our big minds creative to live.
And I certainly know that in my case -- in my situation -- would be very dangerous to begin to be a remote to the skin that I am in my career.
which is really a tiny -- I was just a young -- I have about 40 years.
I still have about four work in me.
And it's very likely that any thing I write of now in the world as it will be judged by the world as the work that was going to be used by my last book.
I'm going to be sket, because we're all the more or friends here -- it's likely to be that my biggest success is to my shares.
Oh, Gesus, that though.
You know this is the kind of thinking that brings a person to start to begin to begin to the nine morning, and I don't want to do it.
I would keep to do this work that I love.
So, the question becomes like, what?
And so I seem to me after a lot of reflection to work to continue to write is to create a psychological coze, OK?
I have to find a security of security between me, that I'm writing to me, and I'm writing about what I would have to do this by reaction that I written E, as I was trying to find out other societies about how to do it if they could have other societies to see if they could have other societies to see if they could have more societies and healthy and health healthy and healthy healthy and health healthy
how to help people to help people to manufacturing emotional inherents of creativity.
And that research has taken me to the ancient Grecia and Rome.
You follow me because it turns back.
In the ancient Grecia and Rome -- people don't seem to believe that creativity came from humans, OK?
And it was thinking that creativity was this is that they have to wine and that came to men from a few distant distant and unknown reasons and unknown reasons and unknown reasons and unknown reasons and unknown reasons and unknown as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well and unknown to win the men of the men of the men of the men of the disorders of the disconnections and unknowknowningus that are the winner to be m
The Greeks called these demons of the creativity "demoni."
Socrate, wonderful, he believed to have a demon that elargive wisdom.
Romans were of the idea, but they call that sort of spirit without a genius.
which is great, because Romans didn't really think that a genius was somebody who was somebody to be smart with a very smart to be somebody to be a very smart of a very smart to be somebody particularly smart to be somebody thinking,
They believed that a genius was this kind of divine that you created in the walls of the study of a study of an artist, a little bit like Dobby, and that came out of the job and to modeling the job of that is going to be the job and to modeling that work.
Exectional -- that's the distance of which I talk -- that costruck psychological psychological that protects you from your work.
And everyone knew that was so that it worked, right?
So the antic artists were protected by certain things, like for example the too narcism, right?
If your work was exceptional wasn't you could take all the market, everybody knew that they could help from this incorporate incorpore.
If your work fab work, it wasn't all your own short for your own failue, right?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be a incapable of incapable of it.
And so people hang conceived the creativity in Ocdent for a long time.
And then Rinascises came and everything, and it changed this big ideas; we put the humans on the middle of the universe and no longer and leaving space to write and no longer space to write creatures that writing from divinity.
This was the principle of the rational principle and people started to think that creativity creativity came completely from the isplit of the isplit of the isplie.
And for the first time in history, he started to refer this or artist as a rather than a genius, rather than a person with genius.
And I have to tell you, I think it was a big error.
I think that allows someone, a simple person to believe to be like a recipe as a recipe and the sistance of all the mysteries and the sisters of all the inthese, creatible and ethern to be a film too largely to give the fragile human fragile --
It's like to ask somebody to emoid the sun
Deform and creates all these ingestious ingestible and creates all these ingestious expectations about performance.
And I think it was this pressure that I destroyed the artists in the pasts 500 years.
And that's true, and I think that is, and I think that the question becomes and now?
Can we do it different?
Maybe I can go back to an ancient understanding of the relationship between humans and creative creative.
Or maybe no.
Maybe we can't cell about 500 years of rational thinking in a 18 minutes.
And there's probably people in the audience that would be related to the scientific suspects on the notion of the notion of the notion that they follow people are going to follow their projects.
I'm not going to convince you all about this thing.
But the question I would like to ask is -- why is?
Why don't you think it in this way?
Because it has more sense of any other thing that I ever heard to explain the creative impredicability of the creative process.
A process that, as anyone who has ever tried to do something -- so, basically, you know, you don't have to do something -- you can't behave.
And, in fact, it can sometimes seem completely paranormal paranormal paranormal paranorm.
I did this meeting with the extraordinary poeter Ruth Stone, who has now 90 years, but that was a poeter for all life and he told me that during his childhood in the wall, and I was working out in the fields, and I was working out in the field of the weld-revenues was from the landscape.
He told me that it was like a fragorous fragorous frage to it.
And that was rotating to her rolling to her landscape.
I felt it would be coming, because he would do the land under the ground underneath its feeds.
He knew to have one thing to do to that point and it was like, "As to run as a morn."
And so he was going to run and and he was following from this poety; and it wouldn't make it a piece of paper and and a pretty much fairly in a freek of rainch, and it would take it and report it on the page.
Sometimes couldn't be quicked, and so correcked and he recorded and rective without you get to the rolled rolled through and poem to go through and she'd go through and lost and she would go through the landscape, and he would go through the landscape, "Another poet.
And then there were those times -- this piece not forget it -- there were no time when the nearly standing at the time that was almost losing them, right?
So, he was running in the house and was looking for paper, and he was looking for a crazy in the wood, and he said, and then he said, that he was going to be away with the other hand and and the offer and the ight.
And he was the poem from the coda and reputs in his body and he was transcend up on the page.
And in these cases, the poem would be presented on perfect and intact to the last word on the last word to the first skin the last word to the first time.
So when I heard -- it's crazy -- it's crazy exactly the same creative process.
Not all my creative process -- I'm not a convict!
I'm a mule, and my way to work is to wake up, I wake up to the same order every day and south and work and work and get us to work and go over and over and over and over it enjoyed.
But even in my mind in my wall, I brokned, I sken against that thing, sometimes.
And I guess that even a lot of you have it.
You know, even if the job and ideas I came up with a certain fount I could have no honestly know that.
And what is this one?
And how can we do relate to this in a way that we don't have the head, but rather that make us height.
And for me about it, the best example I have a Tom I have is Tom Waits, which I interviewed several years ago for a day.
We were talking about this, and you know, Tom, and you know, Tom, for the majority of life has been the incarnation of contemporary creatives -- and to control these species of creatives totally impulse-creative impulses.
But then he was hot and he was driving and a day as he was driving on a Los Angeles, changed everything for him.
He was going to fast and all of a feat this little fragment, that it comes in his head as does inspiration, elusive and and revenue -- and the wants to take it to the wind and the wants you know, it's wonderful, but it doesn't know how to take it.
It doesn't have a piece of paper, it doesn't have a math, it doesn't have a recorator.
So it begins to feel this kind of old anxiety growing in him, "I'm going to lost this song.
I'm not enough enough and I can't do it."
And instead of going to stop in the panic shot him.
And he did something completely new. And he did something completely new.
And he looked at the sky and said, "Sore, you know, I don't see that I'm driving I'm driving it?"
"You seem to write a song hor?
If you really want to exist, you get back to a more opportunity when I can take care of you.
Something ely, you go to care anything else today.
You go to disturbing Leonard Cohen."
And his working changed after that.
Not the work, the work was still as dark as you pretty much as you pretty much off.
But the process, and the fishing anks that was released when the genius, the genius, the genius, that he was going to be a little bit of causing it to anything else and remaining it from where it was a interior.
but well, it's a very wonderful bizarre collaboration a conversation between Tom and this strange and external thing that but was not Tom.
So I felt that story to change a little bit of a little bit of a way I worked and already saved me a time.
This idea, he saved me when I was writing "Mangia, Prega, and I fall of those cave disperation in one of those dispersing in that we are working on something and you can start to think that it will be a worse that that will be a worssgivor written the worst writts.
Not just bad the worst written written written --
And I started to think about designing this project.
But then I remembers from Tom who talked to the air and triay.
So I went to my face on the written and I would say, and I would say, I would have my joins to a room.
And I told you the high to you, "Yes, both both that if this book doesn't be brilliant not be brilliant not be brilliant to be not just shouldn't be be, right?
Because I can see I'm putting all I haven't more about that.
So if you want it to be better, you have to give you and make your party.
OK. But if you don't do it, I don't know what about it.
I'm going to write the same because it's my work.
And I would like to do that I today was recorded to today I represented to me to do my own teash for the North Africa -- -- the same thing in North Africa people were duning for the long of the North Africa's dances and music, and sacred music, and sacred sacred and hourselves to the alba.
And they were always magnants, because the ballers were professional and they were fantastic and they were fantastic.
But every time, rarely, really, something happened, and one of these artists became to transcend.
And I know what I know about why I know you all of you, because I know you all of them to a point, a performance like that.
It was as if you stopped and walking balls through a kind of walking a kind of walking and was not several from usual -- but everything else from us, but everything you had been remarkable.
And suddenly it doesn't just like a human.
But you go from the beyond and under devices in the fire of the divinity.
And when this was happened, to the time -- the people who knew what was, they were called her named with his name.
They were congigave his hands and he started to sing, "Ah, God God, God, God."
That's God, you know.
She has nails -- when the Morioriorian Spna Spay of Spay the Spay of the Spay of the wind changed in the centuries of "Allah, Allah, that you can still feel in the crows or in the corriddging or in the corrids,
In Spain, when an artist has made something impossible and magic and magic "Ah, oh, magnitude, and you know, magnity, you know, magnity, except -- a foot folding -- a foot folding God.
And it's great because we need.
But the problem comes to the day down, for the ballery balls and found that they are the 11 morning, and it turns out that I have the 11 morning, and I found it was the 111 morning.
It's just a deathal with a death, and maybe it will never be able to get to the topics to get that height.
And maybe no one will be a name of God as well, and what so it has to do with the rest of his life?
It's hard to him.
This is one of the most dolorous reconciliations to make in a creative life.
But maybe it doesn't have to be so anguishing if you can not believe that, in fact, that the most extraordinary extraordinary expects of your being coming from you to yourself.
But believsts that are just you from a instance, you know, from a inimaginable, founds of this team of the squisite that you have to go to somebody else when you finished.
And, you know, if we think in this whole way it all changes.
And so I started to think about it, and it's surely as I thought for several months during the workers of the book that I'm going to publishing the book that I'm going to have to followed my great success.
And what I have to go and tell me when I feel electric I feel electric I don't have fear.
I don't just go to the task for your work.
He represents you to you to get you to you, any of your party, any of the way to be.
If your job is ball, dance.
If the divine, you know, I would have a clear genius, you know, for a only moment through your own beautiful moment through your efforts and efforts and then "Ole!"
Something you do with your dance.
And "Ole!" to yourself.
I think I have to teach it.
"Ole!" to yourself, just for yourself, even for humans and textboars from the talks to you to do you continuefy.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
As I already talked about some of these projects on human genome projects, what can meaning and the discovery of genes.
We're now starting a new path -- we started to digitalize biology and now to go from that code and now from that code and now we are getting into a new phase and synthesizing and synthesizing life.
We always tried to take a big question.
"What is the life?" is something that a lot of biologists I think they tried to figure out how to levels.
We tried different approach, reducing it to the minimes of terms.
We're digitalizing from nearm.
When we sequenced the human genome is to go from the world from the analogical world of biology to the digital world.
Now we ask us, we can regenerate life, or create new life from this digital universe from this universe universe --
This is the map of a little organism, the Mycoplasma parts of parts of the smallest genome of those that can replicate in the lab of those that can replicate in lab lab in the lab of those that can replicate in the lab of the tiny map of the tiny map of a small organism, which is the tiny of the t
And we tried to reduce the genome to create a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of it.
We are able to eliminate a hundred genes of the about 500 that are here.
But when we look at his metabolic map of metabolic map of us.
Credestic, this is simple
But when we look at all the genes that we can heliminate, one at the time, it's very improbabable that this can bring to a live.
So we decided that the only way to progresing was to synthesizing this chromosome of these questions.
And so we started the wind of "Prepynetizing a chromom cromom cromom and so we can synthes?"
Can chemistry to produce these big molecules that we never had been able to create before we never had to create before?
And in a rectacking, can we make a cromosic chromosis?
A chromosome, it's just a piece of chemistry of inert.
The speed with which we are able to type is growing to exponential exponential is growing to exponential exponential to the life is growing range of the speed with which we are able to type the life is growing rhythm.
Our ability to write the genetic code, progress rather slowly, but it's better deal.
And our more recents results the door to a exponential curve.
We started over 15 years ago.
The process has been required a lot of step, starting with a biothic review before the first experiments.
But we found that synthesize DNA is very difficult.
There are decade of thousands of cars in the world that produce small segments of DNA, of 30 to 50 to 50 to 50 to 10 letters and it's a degenerative process.
So we had to develop a new method to assemble these fragments and correct the errors.
And this was our first attempt to start by digital information of Phi X174.
It's a little viruses that bacteria.
We designed the errors and made the correction of the errors and got a molecule of DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters.
The interesting part is when we took this piece of inert material chemistry and we put it in bacteria, the bacteria have started reading this genetic code and producing that virtual particles in virtual particles.
The virals are then released by cells, they went back and they took the cells, and they destroyed the E.
I talked about recently with recently oil industry saying that they certainly understood this model.
They have more than you.
We think this is a situation where software can really build his own hardware in a biological system in a biological system in a biological system.
But we wanted to do the more things --
We wanted to build the whole chromosome.
It's more than 580,000 letting code.
So we thought I could build it in the sizes of virus, so we can change the cassets to figure out what the components are a living cassets of living cell.
design, is crucial and if we start with digital information in a computer, these are must be very accurated.
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 was a standard was a standard for every 10 mistake for every 10 mistakes for every 10 mistakes to go.
We found that original instance, 30 errors. If we had that original sequence, we would never be able to do it work.
A part of the process is to designer segment of the process that you stay with all the other segments of 50 letters to build under-making seats to build underlying subunits.
We do a uniquent elements here.
You probably read that we read the class of the crows.
And I think that we have a chective genetic code genetic code genetic code and T.
Three of those letters code together and code about 20 load, and there's a specific orders for every loving love.
So we can use genetic code to write words, fraise thinking --
What we did in the beginning was automatically.
Some of them were deling from the fact that it was not reach.
We designed these segments to just just to join with my own own way.
There are people to repaid them and they put them and put them together.
And we started to assembly from the parts, starting with segment from five to seat, and it can be a lot of letter to make 24 miles of letting to 72 miles of letting to 72 miles of letter to 72 miles.
And every step we product these segments in abundance so we can sequence, so we can sequence, we are trying to create a extremely robusts -- how you will see in a minute.
We're trying to automatizing the process.
So, this looks like the tabellon a basic plays.
When we get these segments very long, 100 mile segments are not going to grow more directly in E.
You get to the limited tools of modern biology tools.
So we have some mechanisms.
We knew about another mechanism called recombination of homology called "recombination of biology to repaid the DNA to repair seats.
Here's an example of that.
This organism, called Deinococcus radio ccus radiation can be three million radiation
You can see in the high school require as his chromosome.
In 12 -- 24 hours is reassembly like it was before.
There is thousands of organisms that are able to do that.
These organisms can set completely section.
They can live under empty.
I'm absolutely certain that life exist in space, and you move to find new environments of water environments
As the NASA showed that this living lives.
This is a molecule that we built using these process, just by using these process, just by using the lievised design appropriate to insectors.
The lievidence that automatically aware cars.
This picture was not taken with a electronic microscope, but with a rular microscope rule.
It's a molecule that we can see with a touch that we can see with a law with a law.
These are pictures that cover a period of about six seconds.
This is the publishing that we did a little time ago.
It's more than 580,000 letting code of genetic code.
It's the biggest molecule that has ever created by by man.
It has a weight molecular at 300 million hands.
If we spent with a 10 without 10 without spaces, you would take a 142 pages only to transckers to get this genetic code.
Now, how do we do it work? How can we active.
Obviously, you can go is a girl.
It's a little more complicated when you use bacteria.
It's also simpler when it's a cell phones as our reeucarios as our reck and you can just extract the nucleus and insert a clonation process.
In the archaea is intea is integrated in the cell phone, but we recently recently demonstrated that we are able to do a complete traplant of a cell cell phone and active it.
We can recorded a micromosome of a microbial species.
The two are different as men as well as well as well.
We have some genes in a way that we could decide what to choosing for this chromom for this chromom --
And he skin with the goldes in a way to kill all the proteins.
And when we put it in the cellphone was wonderful -- and you appreciate our physticatos -- and you appreciate our phone.
And we started that we couldn't go begin to beyond that, but we tried to communicate in there.
This is one of the majoryfields.
We found that a lot of species have added a second or a third or a third of some parts, adding a thousands of new tracks in a thousands of new traits tracks to that species.
So who think of evolution as only as a gene that modic is not a lot of biology.
There is people called the restrial in the instance, which is that they found DNA.
The chromosome that was in cell.
The cellphon-house cromosome that we put it -- ha.
It's expressed, and he recognized the other chromosome as extremely as an extrane; and we have just recognized with the cell and new cromoso.
It became blue for genes that we put in genes we put it.
And in a short of time, all the characteristics of a species are going to be perhaps and it turned out of all the new species -- which we put in the cell.
All the proteins have changed, the membranes are changed, and when we read the genetic code of exactly what we turned out.
Now, this might look at genetic alchemiia but by altering DNA we can change the things in enough enough to change the things enough sustain.
Now, I've already explained that you don't talk about genesis -- but progress from three million years and evolution, and I said that maybe we're going to create a new version of the Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosion of new species that you will create new species of this digital process.
Why do that?
I think it's enough when we think about our needs needs.
We're going to spend six billion and a half people to nine billion in the next 40 years.
I'm going to give an example: I was born in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for each other in 1946; in 1946; it will be four.
We're now having problems now to find food, water and clean and clean and clean and half a half billion and a half a half billion people.
It's going to be hard to do it for nine billion.
We have five billion carbon billion carbon and more than 30 billion barrel.
That means a day.
When we look at biologist, or any kind of processes to replace and replace to replace them, it's going to be a huge challenge of it.
We have to keep it to the whole half of CO2 emission from these materials that goes into the atmosphere.
At day of today, thank you to the scientific discoveries in all over the world, we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I like to think that are designed for the future.
The electronic industry has only a dozen about components, and think about how many different things came out.
Our limited here are data principles from biologic reality and our imagination.
Now we have techniques, thanks to these rapid methesization in able to create what we call combinatories.
We are able to build a big robot that can produce a million chromosomes a million chromosomes a day.
Think about processing these 20 million different genes or to optimize the processing to produce optimizing or drugs, and you can change a little bbmacy, we can change a little team, and create biology and create biology now that in the last 20 years of science.
And it's simply a standards.
We can choose to survival to survive, chemistry production or carbon and fuels of vaccines.
This is a few software programmed with which we're working to be able to seat us and designing species and design.
Well, we don't know necessarily as they well.
We know exactly how they is their genetic code.
Now we're concentrate on fourth of fourth generation.
You can see that you see that you extranol from the grand was a finished experiment experiment of the sketanol experim.
We have a second further and third generation that will come up enough pretty soon as well as a topped value as the top, or different types of butanol.
But the only way biology can have a big impact without major major major impact the cost of food and limited the disponhibility would be turn to the cell that we are working to designing cells that we are working to cells that can reach this discover, and we can realize this discoveries in about 18 months.
The sunlight to combined with CO2 is a metodo-- but in our discoveries around the world, we found different methods.
This is a organism that we described in 1996.
She lives in the ocean deep about 200 feet deep temperature deep temperature of the water temperature of water to the water temperature of the water temperature of the water temperature of the water.
They put from CO2 using molecular using molecular energy source like source of energy.
We're trying to figure out if we can get CO2, which can easily be transported to be transported by maamitself to convert that CO2 in carbant carbant and to drive this process.
So we think that we could be able to increase what the basic questions that the basic questions "What is life, truth is Noin, true. We have the toilet obic goal to replace the oil industry.
Exactly. If you can't do it from TED, where you can do it?
It would become a major of energy.
And then we're working to use the same way to use the same way to create vaccines to create vaccines of instants.
You saw this year with influence, we're always background a year and a dollar and a dollar in less when you treat the right vaccine is to find rightless vaccine the right of the right thing.
I think that you can change by changing combinable vaccinable in ancient anciouse.
Here is the future could start to look like change, now, the evolution, the evolution, acceling evolution, accelerating evolution, and then weapons, and then weather cells.
We're so much more than the people to do.
Our purpose is to make enough to try to do it. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
First of all I'm going to see the most quickly possible, some fundamental work that we took Microsoft in the world that we took Microsoft in a year ago.
It's a local level, you can interact is in the local level, which remote with a huge amount of visual data --
We're seeing a lot of pictures of digital photos with a kind of raining rains, and a speed of bread, to say, "Lewish the images as we want to do the images as we want to do it.
And it doesn't matter how big information we see, how big we see, how big these data pieces of data or images.
Most are communicated, but this for example is a provenious scansion from the Bilibrary of Congress, and he comes in the Congress and reenter in the gam.
It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that limited the prestations of a system like this is the number of place in any time. It's also an architecture. It's also an architecture very flexible.
This is a book -- this is an instance, you know,
This is the Dickens. Every desolated Dickens. Every covertising a capitol.
To demonstrate that it's just text and not images, we can do something like this, to see really that it's a real representation of the text representation of the text representation of the text --
It could be a little bit of an artificial way to read a electronic book.
You don't look at it.
This is an example of the Guardian The Guardian The Guardian for Guardian example of the Guardian example of the Guardian example of the Guardian examp.
Every image is the beginning of a section.
And it gives you really pleasure and the beautiful experience of read the version of a magazine, or a newspaper or a newspaper of a newspites of medriving like a half half a lot of medriving of the pleasures of the pleasures of the piece of a new
We also did something with the angle of this number of the Guardian of the Guardian --
We created a high advertising of high resolution -- much higher than what you use in a normal publish.
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile, you can see here.
Or other models, or even the specific specific models, or even the specific models, or even the specific models, or even the specific models, or even the topics.
And this really exhibition to some of these ideas to eliminate the limitations of space on the screen of space on the screen.
We hope this means to put up and other hands and other hand, and other hports like that, not to be necessarily to be necessary.
Of course, the maping is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology.
And I don't want to lose time, if not to say that we have to report that we have to give it in this field.
These are all the roads in the U.S. Sholding an geospatial image of NASA.
So we're going to go to something else.
This is actually from the websk; you can go to the web; you can see it up.
It's a project called Photosynth, who combine two different technologies.
One is Seadragons and the other is a visual research, a very interesting research, a student of Washington, with the University of Washington, with the U.S. and Rick Seitze" and Research. She's a Research. Seliski Research.
And it's from Seadragons to the Web, gest, I was viewragon.
You can see that when we do this is that we can go from a picture and have this kind of picture and have this kind of experience to multiple resolution to multiply resolution to multiple out of a multiple resolution to multiple out of a picture of multiple of the skets that we can go from a picture and have this kind of experience to multiple it to multiple it to multiple out of a multiple skets that kind of multiple se.
But the space of the pictures here has actually actually actually a meaning.
The computer algorithms of visualization have registls together, so that they recorrespond to the reals that -- all the neighborhood -- all the neighborhood -- you were taken by the Montontags -- have been taked. Hollers. So wherever you see elements of a slides of a slides of the space.
I don't know if I have time to show you some other environment.
There are some more space than the space of the space of the space of them.
I want to go directly to one of the original data set of Noah-- and this is from a previous Photosynthosynynth. And this is really really the key to show you what I think I think is really the key to show you what I think is really the key to do this technology, Photosynth. And it's not necessarily as wrong as we have put in the web.
We had to concern about legal aspects and so on.
This is a rebuilding in Notre Donegic pictures made from Flickr. Basta Dame in Flickr. and you get images of the types in Flickr. And you get images of these conithets and so on. Everyone of these connects a picture that is discovering a picture that is discovering a model.
So they are all pictures from Flickr and and have been all connected to space this way.
And it's possible to navigate in this simple.
You know, I would never have been thinking about to Microsoft.
It's very gratify to receive this kind of belong.
I think you can see that it's a lot of different types of focusing SLR, a lot of different phones to those cell phone to the SLR, a significant number of significant, matter together in this environment.
And if you can do that, I try to look for those strange.
Many are they blocked by down, etc.
She's a series of photographs -- execule.
This is a Notre poster of Notre Dame registrlly.
We can go from the poster of the poster view of this environment.
The essential point is that we can do with the social environment. This is now taking from everything -- from the whole memory of how it appears -- and it's a visual point -- and it connects all those data together.
All of these pictures become connection, and the summer of the same.
You have a model of the land that emerge.
Think about this as the Stephen Lawler work.
It's something that is that it grows in complexity as people us, and the vantages for people who use it to the people who use it as well.
Their pictures are hmarched with other people.
If someone is the idea of contrast all these sants saying the name of Notre Dame immersic set of Notre Dame immersily recovers of all those dates, and I can use it as a name for immergs in that universe, in that metaphands in that universe, in that universe, using the photographs of anyone else -- and have a social experience of a cross-us.
Of course, a consequence of this is that are virtual virtual models of every interesting part of the earth, and it doesn't just go from the plane and satellitaries and images and set and secuts, but the memory of collective virtual images and similar models and and similar models and of course, a collective virtual patterns and so on.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I realize? What your software going to have to do is that at certain point, the next few years, all the photographs and shared from anyone in the world who are going to be practically connected together?
BA: Yeah. What is doing is basically discovered.
He's creating hyperline, if you want to be, between images.
And it's doing it in the bottom of the images.
The becomes very interesting if you think of the wealthy information that a lot of these images can have it.
As you do a research of images on the Web, you told a sentence and the web on the web has a lot of information about the pictures of the picture.
Now, what happens if that pictures to all your photos are you going to take phote?
So the amount of interconnection and the amount of reck and the amount of reck that is really enormous. It's a classic effect of the rete.
CA: But, it's really incredible. Compliments.
BA: I thank you very much.
One of the major when you travels travels and one of the research is the power to live between who hasn't forgot to live between who has no anti-traditions, between who's going to be in the wind of raining plants.
You know, the With amans Jaguar Twish Way the Lattea, or that the myths are still meaning for meaning or in Himalaya, the budy of the Dharma, to remember the respire Dharma, to remember the importance of the central anthropologia, and that idea that we don't exist the world that we don't exist in sense sense that we don't exist model, but it's just a reality,
the consequence of a particular choices that our adaptations that our stirps has done in a lot of age.
And, of course, we all share of the essential traits of trates.
We all have to come in. We all procreive it.
We're subjected to be beginning to be retased to be relief
We have to deal with the inexorability of death, so it doesn't surprising us and draws --
all of us art.
What it is the particular retless of the song, the rhythm's rhythming dance of every culture.
It doesn't matter that they are the Pholes of the Borneo, or the follows of Haiti, or the Haiti, or the Kenya sectors in Kenya secent Sahara.
He was my journey in desert of journey in desert a month ago, or a yak in the I.m.
All these people teach that there are other ways to think there are other ways to think about other ways to think about other ways to get in the world.
And you reflect a moment, it's a concept that can give you hope.
Inside, the world are creating a ragnitude of the world create a ragnateffort and cultural life that has been making the planet and it's important for the well-being of the planet as biosphere.
And you can think of this ragnateful cultural as an etnose and you can define the ethnosing ethnos' effort of all the concept of all the concept of all the concept of human imagination from the human alba consciousness.
The ethnos: The great patrimonurimonurimonug.
It's the symbol of what we're and what we can be in as kind of inspiring species --
And because biosphere was freshly consumed by the way as it was a remarkable to ethnose and purpose.
No biologist, for example, it would say 50, it was on the hours is just on the hours is just the orest ipocality, or -- in the most pocalittic diversity -- in the field diversity -- and you don't even near the biologic diversity.
The indication of this is, of course, the tongue loss
When you were born there were 6,000 languages on this planet.
A language is not just by a vocabulary or from a series of rules or a series of rules.
One is the sharp of the human spirit of the human spirit of the human spirit
It's the meet with which animation is going to the animation in the material.
Every linguishing is a forest of mind, a thinking back; a thinking, a thinking of possibilities.
And of those 6,000 languages as we are here sitting here at Monterey, at least half the kids.
They don't teach children, which means you know, unless not anything, but they don't do something --
What is there is more than being folks from the sket, of being the last myself, the last tongue of the kidsetches to get the wisdom of the children?
This is a fashion was somewhere in some part of the world every two weeks: every two week of a older and driven with it in the ultimate and drop of a ancient language.
And I know someone of you will tell "Is it not better way.
The world isn't going to be a better if we were we all the same language?" Benism?" Benism?" Benive.
We talk to a drive go.
You will find a track of what it means it doesn't tell your language.
I would like to do a journey through eply etnish --
a little journey in ethnosing ethpnoise.
Many of us forget that when I say "different different different ways of existers" I mean really intenough existers.
We take for example this bimbo Barasan Amazonia in Amazonia and the anaconda, which creates to the mit side of the west breads of the west bread of the west pan.
It's a popular that it's not able to distinguishing the blue color from the green because the celests is identified in the forest, from that it depens the popular popular popular popular blo.
They have a strange language and a mathemthem, "tank-English exogamy -- you have to get a different language.
This has roots in the past, the particularity is that in these family is that in these family extra family is that these are talking about six or seven languages to be a tremendous mystock of a language.
They listen to and then start talking about.
We take one of the most interesting tribes that I have lived with which I lived -- the Woranan orange of the most interesting popular contact in 1958.
In 1957, five missionaries have tried a committed contact to a fact that a fact that was a fact that
They did walk from the photographs that they were retled with friends, that they were involved that this population population had never seen anything that has never seen anything to see about the size.
They have pictures from the ground and they turned them to research for a shape or a figura -- and they kill out that it was the diavole, and they killed the five of the five of missionaries of the five of missionarians.
But the Waorans don't just kill strangers.
They killed to them.
Five percent of mortality was caused by them for themselves.
We are rising to eight generations and we found two of natural death and when we insisted for knowledge, they have been so that one of them was so that it was deading and then killed it killed it up. And then killed it was a knowledge.
The hunters were able to recognizing urine urine from 40 steps and recognized the species.
In the first '80s, it was assigned a very interesting tremendous task when my professor Haititi asked me if I wanted to go to Haititi to intrupholaring societies to the basis of the power and TontMacoutes, and I impossessed to make suzombies.
To give a sense of miracle I would have to understand the Vod's culture Vod's culture and that is not nera.
It's quite a complex metaphysics of the world.
Many interesting.
If I ask you to tell me the big religions of the world, what would I would say to you?
Cristian, Buddh, Buddhism, Ebrain --
A continent is always left outside and thinking that sub-Saharan Africa-Sharian doesn't have religious religious of these religious concepts very deep to the tragics of these religious concepts of nuts in the trageasy of the slavery of the slavery.
What makes your interesting is reported with life is reported with life and dead.
So you have to make the spirits.

So you see that incredible events these incredible events. I follow the tops that touch touch touches inker a rather forward of the mind when it was catalyzed in the body of the mind when it was catalyzed in a state of exectising events.
I lived in all the people I lived in the most extraordinary Kogi is the Kogi Santa Marta, in the Koge in Santa Marta, in the secentries.

The young people follow from the family to three or four years, and they live in a hundred of four and four secret and flew in a handbasis for 18 years.
Two of nine years of choices to reproduce the nine months that are going to reproduce the nine months that turn into the utery of the Great Mad.
For this time, they come acculated to values of their values that predict their prayer and only their prayer and they keep the balance -- or to say the balance -- or to say the equilibrium.
At the terms of this incredible initiation, they come out and so forth, and for the first time in life in their life, at the age of 18 years, they see a alba. And in that active of the first wrong backy -- when the sun sun of the beautiful lands of the landscape is conferred in his sload. And the pretty much of his beautiful step and say:

It's amazing. Now it's going to protect it."
They call the biggest brothers and say that we now, brothers are the brothers of the world.
This intuitions is extremely important.

This tribe, Cofan, has 17 varieties of ayaas, which are born, and that are born in the forest, and that to our eyes would come in the same species.
If you ask him how they are they going to tell them how they will tell us "I think I would think I realize plants, I realized plants, I said, "No."
The solution is taking 17 varietes in a night of the side and a place and a place to a different type with a different type.
With you don't have to Harvard, but it's much more interesting than to counting the ames.
Now, the problem is that also the problem is that also that the people who have heart care of the inner to the sea history of the history of the real-to-mards of the real-to-mards of the world and spend to our real world and it goes to be hearing our reality, and then it turns out that they have to be a cookinger to the history of us that are in the history of us who are in the real-history of us who are in the history of us that are the world
In fact, the 20th century, in 300 years, it doesn't remind for his innovations or innovations or innovations and technological innovations -- but rather like it was in which we are stopped and we have been actively accepted the destruction of the planet. It's not change.
All cultures have been involved in a dance to new dance for new possibilities.
And the problem isn't technology.
The Sioux not stopped to be Sioux when they put from part and freech, and they were stopped to be Americans have not stopped to be Americans when they put part of the horse and caless.

in which the wisdoms of all the people can contribute to our well-being collective.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some things I wrote in this book that I hope I call other than I hope and I will try to deal with some connections in case not recognize.
I want to start with what I call "the dog, offical."
The officer of what?
The dogmam officer of all the Western societies in the Western dog, "If we want to massimizing the well-being of our citizen."
The reason for the one side, in the fact that the freedom is in the same value, is precious, useful, essential essential beings.
As the other he's that if we're freedom, each of us can act to do everything to do about what massive our well-being, without any that we decide in our well.
The way to massive freedom is to be to simizing choice.
More people have hanno, the more choice, and the more is their freedom, and it's their well.
This one is so deeply, it's so deeply that no one would have to put it into the two-fashing it to put it into it into the two-fash.
And it's also deeply radicated in our lives.
I'll show you some examples of what progress has made possible.
This is my supermarket. It's not particularly big --
I allowed a simple named on a regious conditions.
In my supermarket are 175 conditions, without containing 10 varieties of oil oil and 12 acets balsamic acets that you can buy to make you a huge number of conditions in the circumstance that nobody is that no one of the skin is of your degrees is to your degree and in your degree of the skin your skets of your dement.
Here's the supermarket.
Then you go to the electronic store, to buy a result stere: casses, CD, radio Plector CD, radio print.
And in this single negotic negotic shoot, there's a big number of components.
We can make six million different and a half million different combinations using the components that are in one negotid.
You have to admit that there's a lot of choice.
Some of the world of communications.
One times, when I was a child to get all the services phones phone wish, so they could have a mamma that were proviited by mammam Bell.
You read the phone -- you didn't buy it out.
A consequence of that, in the other one was that the phone doesn't stroken out of it.
These days.
Now we have a phones light from phones, especially between cellphones, especially between cellphones.
Here's the future.
My favorite is the middle, the buttor of the nose of the nose of the nose to the nose myself.
If you have not seen it in the story store under house you're going to revery.
And what happens is that people go into the stores and it does this question and make this question. And you know what the answer? The answer is "No."
It's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn't too too much of them.
So, in other aspects of life that are much more important than the water explosion of choices.
Assistance is not going to happen, in the United States that you go from the doctor and the doctor and the doctor you what you have to do.
Instead, you go from doctor, and the doctor says, "Okay, could we do A, or B" "As it got these benefits and these risk." Bs these risks. What do you want to do it?"
You said, "Dr. What should I do?"
And the doctor says, "A has these benefits, and these risks."
"What do you want to do?"
And you rebat the rebat, "Dr. if she was what to do?"
And the doctor: "But I'm not here."
The result we call it the malato," expression that it makes it look like a beautiful thing.
But it doesn't really have a shift that one weight and responsibility to make someone who knows someone who knows someone that you know anything else -- and so it doesn't know -- and so in not -- and so in the ideal conditional to make the patient.
There's a huge marketing of drugs products pharmaceutics, I would say to people like me and if you think it doesn't make sense, that we can't buy them.
But if we can't buy them, why do you publishing them?
The answer is that they want domor we call the doctors to ask for ask to change the recipe for the recipe of it.
Something like is our identity as is our identity is a question of choice, as you see in this point of the inner "We don't want to force the children. They'll not want to force the right time.
And we can reinvented us how many times we can get us it.
That means that every morning, you have to decide that you have to decide that kind of persons wants to be like.
Ripe to the family and marriage, a time time prospective, I was such a clear, about it was that you could get the most pretty much as possible, and you started to get to the pretty much as you can get the pretty much as much as you can get pretty much as much as I could get the pretty much as you can get the pretty much as well.
The only one one is choice was with then, and not here, and not even what to do later.
Today, everything is really to play.
I teach them very smart students and I think about 20 percent less of work than a time.
And because they don't do that they are very brilliant, because they are not less diligent.
but why are they impensive to ask you, I mean I would make me me or now? I should do it now?"
"I have to get more tardi? I have to think before I got to think before I get kids or career?"
They're running interrogatives of logor.
And they try to answer these questions, even if this imply not to completely releasing a touch and not get a beautiful vote to my exam.
And they have to do that. They're really important questions to do.
Now, the work: we're lucky, like Carl arl -- because the technology allows us to work every day, from every day, from every day, from every day, from every day, from the Hotel Randolph.
To parentess, there's a corner, and I'm not going to tell anybody whom the WiFi works.
I don't say that I want to use ye.
What does that mean this incredible freedom to choice that we have to work on the work? What we have to do we have to work or not.
We can go to the hot cell phone to play hot on a tas, the Blackberry in the other, and the news -- typically on the knee.
And even if they're all pushing, every minute that we see our son fire out the game, we're also asking it, "I have to answer this to the call?"
"I have to get this email? I have to ablear this letter?"
And even when the answer is "us," all this makes the experience of your son very different touching from what would be in other conditions.
So, anywhere we look at that, things we look at it, things and big objects and big objects and life, life is a question of choice.
Once the world was this: Ove, there were some possibilities, but it wasn't a choice.
The world today is like this, the dilemma is, "Is it is a good thing -- or negative negative negatives?"
The answer is Shecks.
The positive sides we know everybody, so I'm going to talk about the negative ones.
All this choice two neg-effect two neg-effect on people.
The first one is that it makes paralities instead of instead of free paralities instead of free.
With many options of which chooses, it becomes very difficult to do it.
I want to give you an example of mean -- a study conducted on plans plans of volunteers.
A minute of my colleagues of Vansed, the giant of though, the giant societies with about a million clients of clients in 2,000 different companies.
What she found was that for every 10 solutions that are offered by every 10 solutions that are offered more than 22 percent devices from 22 percent.
With 50 sources there's 10 percent less than 10th ades when they have been available only 5. Why?
Because with 50 sources that chooses, is malezed to decide and the choices is remained to the inquestions.
And the question and questions, and the questions, and of course, questions and of course, questions not to be there.
You know, you know that this is not just that these workers will be making food for canoes because they don't have enough money, it means that the decision is so hostic that decision is that they even have the founds of complementary data to work.
They don't have to participated, they're lost until 50-dollars per year from work, which would be to crawing them.
So the paralysis is a consequence of having too many choices.
And I think it makes the world like that.
"And finally, for ethernity: ketchup, sense or major maion?"
You would just take the right decision if it's for ethnity, true?
You don't want to choose the wrong wrong and neps the wrong.
So this is the first effect. The second is that even if we can avoid the parals, and we do a choice, we finally are less to be satisfied by how we would be able to have been with less options that you choosed.
And this for different reasons.
One of them is that with a lot of conditions that you would have to choose and it's not perfect and it's not perfect to be able to make a different choice, and that you could make a different choice, and that is that the alternative imaginduces the alternative inducs to the choice, and the remainport of choice, and the remaining the remains the remaining decision,
even when it was a great decision.
More choices are easy to be dispivineasy to any details that it is insodden in the choice.
And then there's what economists are called the cost-opportunities.
Dan Gilbert very well stamp like value that we are as the value that we are depends on what we comparison.
And in the ststanding options that you can have a lot of represents alteric characteristics of alternative and be less satisfied of the option that you have choice.
Here's an example I skin all the ones that are not New York Cit."
But that's what you probably thinking.
There's this couply to Hamptons.
A place of lux.
It's all a beautiful day. It's all for them.
Not nothing. But what he thinks is, "Well, males," it's Augusting."
"Everybody neighbors in Manhattan are alive."
"I could talk to you about the front of you."
And it turns two weeks to be that is losing from the idea that is losing -- every day -- the possibility of parking to go.
The expensive opportunity diminishes the softwtion for what we have, even when the choice was excellent.
And the more are the options that we have to look at the more characteristics will be returned out to be as a coast of opportunities.
Here's another example of that.
This view is a lot of things.
It talks about the time and maybe live at the moment, and maybe you live slow.
But the most important point is that anything you choice, you choices you choices don't do anything else.
The things we don't chooses have a lot of facactive that can make less attement what we do.
Third point: I was a growing expectative.
I tried on my skin and buying a new jeans.
I have almost jeans.
Once jeans were one of the jeans and clothes and clothes and clothed out of the gestia, they were comfortable to get them and a lot of times, they started to go well.
So, I went to buy a new jeans when the old ones were going, and I said, "I need a couple of jeans, this is my cuteans, this is my cute."
The committed said, "Like you want slim fit, and asy fitt?"
With with the cernier or bottontones? "Wit," or "acish" or "acishing?
"Liks?"
"Sotbult you want to be belong, or stretty? Big -- -- he was elencovering to elense it.
I was wearing and after a little I was able to say, "I want the guy -- "I want the only guy -- that was the only typoth." It didn't think I was so I I tried to all of the jeans, and then I went out of the negotio, with the best jeans that I had had the best jeans that I had never had it.
It was the male of the choice. And all that picked had the best.
But I felt I worse I was going to feel.
Why? I wrote a whole book to understand it.
The reason I was worse with the worse is that with all of my hands were very high myself, altised was very well.
And I had expectations I didn't expect for anything exceptional when you exception, it only was a type, at least a type, at least a perfect.
What I had water was good -- but it doesn't perfect.
After I satives of what I was trying to insure I was insumption to what I was looking for it.
The add of options in life of the people don't increasing the expectations that these have respectations of options.
And this will produce less satisfied when the results are good --
No one in the world of marketing if you make it count.
Because if you know what I'm talking about.
The truth is more like that.
"You were better when he was worse when he was worse.
Today we are in the world that we live -- opulywells with the perfect of perfection -- the massive that we can hope is that we can hope is that things are to the height.
You never have any surprised because you have to be expectative, my expectative, and they have injury.
The secret of happiness -- what you're here -- is I said, "Basape."
I mean, little audience moment, I am really married -- that I am really married and my wife is really amount of it.
I could have no good at all, I didn't have any time.
But I can tell you is not always a bad thing.
And finally, a couple of jeans comfortable jeans comfortable when there's only the kind of satisfied -- and you ask you, "Why?"
"Who is responsible?" "The answer is clear.
The world is responsible. What could I do about it?
When you have hundreds of jeans, and you buy a insumption, and you ask you who is responsible to you who is responsible to you have the responsible to be as a responsible for you to yourself.
You could do it better.
With hundreds of varieties, there's not for insuccess.
So when people take decisions, even if the result is the result is the one that you feel result and they make the chcolp to them themselves.
In the last few years the depression is exploded in the industrialized world.
I think a gentleman -- not the univer, but important -- not the unique, but important -- this depression is that people have deludings because the standards are too high.
And when they have to explain this situation think that the cope is them.
So the final result is that we are better, objectively, but we feel worse.
Let me remind you that.
This is the offical dog, what we all take for and it's completely fail.
There is no doubt that a little bit of choices is better that I don't have a lot better than a lot of choices is better than a little bit.
There's a critical, magic value. I don't know what it is.
But I'm sure we went from a piece that we went from a piece that choices that choices our life.
Now, from the political point -- I have almost finished -- from the policy point of view, the following is the following point of viewing point of view,
What it allows all this choice in the industrial societies is the material.
There are many places in the world, and you know about it, and you know about it, where the problem is not that have too choice.
The problem is that they have too popular with it.
So the fact that I'm talking about is a males' being a disease to be modern of modern modern and Western societies
And what makes you depress and arrabbing is this: Steve Levitt told you yesterday about how you have these expensive and seats are involved by useful.
I mean, these choices, complicated and dispendy and dispendings, it's not just that they are just useful.
They are deleters.
They have to be worse.
If a little bit of what in our societies allows was reversed in those where people have too few choices have too few choice, it would be not just their life better, but also the way I can also be able to do it.
This is what economists are called a better paretian.
A redistrong redle red-red-red-recome -- not just the poor, not just the poor poor.
And to concluder, you can become everything that I want, you can become everything --
You know, culture, you know, you think that weigh, "What does that creat?"
"It's obvious that you can't make anything in a vetron in a vet."
"As fall, a limited view of the world --
and I realized this in the beginning.
But then, I think about that, I realized that fish the long.
Because the fact of the facts is that if you go to frank the frank of the frank -- you don't get freedom.
If you rop the mouse that all becomes possible to become possible decreation.
You can get the parals, and you reduce the well-being.
They need a sphere.
This is almost certainly too strect, maybe even for us.
But the absence of some symbolic sphere is a recipe for infectious instance, for the road.
Thank you very much heart.
