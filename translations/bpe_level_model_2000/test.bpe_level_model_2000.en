Pareck years ago, here at TED, Peter Skillman introduced a challenging challenge.
And the idea is very simple.
Four people have to build the highest people to build the highest possible that you rect in the following 20 spaghects, a meter tanks, a meter tape and a marshmallow.
The marshmallow needs to be brought to the top of the tower.
And even though it seems very simple is pretty difficult, because costrings people to collaborate very quickly.
So I thought it was an interesting idea that it was an interesting, and I incorporate it into a project.
And it was a huge success.
And since then, I have organized about 70 labs of designing this kind of kind of projection with students, designers and architects, even the research and developments of Fortune 50.
There is something in this exercise that reveal lessons of collaboration, and I'd like to share some of these lessons with you.
Normally, most people start with the orienting orientate towards the combitts.
And they are talking about, you know, they would aspect for the power, then they spend the time.
They give the sketches and preavailets.
They come up the most of the time at most of the time to assembling the spaghit to the find, just when the time he's going to shall the time is going to shelf the marshmallow, and drink the marshmallow, and dropping the top of the top and Ta-from the top and Ta-from behind and Ta---
They have the work.
But what happens is really, most of the time is that the "Ta-h-h-oh-h-oh-h-oh-hous, because the fish of the marshmallow is to fold and collapsing the whole structure.
There is a number of people who have a lot more moments than others, and the worst of other people, and the worst are the neolaudiences of business schools.
They cheeat, cheat, and they create structures absolutely traballs.
And there are of course groups that have a lot more structures than the best plomate schools.
And it's incredible.
As Peter, not just create the highest structures, but it's also the most interesting structures.
And your question, why? Why is this possible? What's going to be particular? What's going to be particular?
And Peter to say, "No one of the kids to spend time trying to become the director of Spurch. Right.
They don't spend time competing for the power.
But there's also another reason.
And the reason is that the students of economics are formed to find the single individual.
And then you can get it.
And later, what happens is that when they put the marshmallow in the top of the ske, and what happened?
The crisis.
Right.
What children are different from the marshmallow, and they build prototype, and build produce prototyping the marshmallow, they are always able to add the marshmallow, they have different possibilities.
The designers recogning that this kind of collaboration is the essence of the recognitive process.
And with every version, children have a feedback about what works and what it doesn't work.
So the ability of working on prototypes is essential, but we see how different groups.
The average for most people is about 50 centers is about 50 centers, for the students of economic students, about half a little bit better, but not very, very children, better than many adults.
Who does better?
Archity, thank you very much.
99 cm is the highest structure I ever seen.
And why? Because they realize that triangles and the geometric models are the key to build structures.
Then we have the general directors, a little better than media.
But here's where it becomes interesting.
If you including a deleged administrator, the group to do much better.
It's incredible. You look at a turn, you see, "You see that that group will wind that group will be able to understand it. And why?
Because they have particular to again evolve to agree.
The process the process, to understand it.
And all the groups that are running and prestack attention to work better.
So special and dots of agevolation, and their combination, and their combination bring to a sure success.
If you have 10 groups working good, you have 10 groups that are going to get structures that are in the building.
And I tried a interesting experiment.
I thought, let's do it for a time.
I put it on the 10,000 dollars of prize in software to the team wincents.
What do you think that happened to the design?
Which was the result?
That's what happened.
No one of the team has created a stable structure.
If one of them had built a 2.5 house structure from 2.5 houses to the premie.
Isn't that interesting that a high pop has an impact so forth?
We tried again, the exercise with the same students.
What do you think happened?
Now they had understood the value of a prototype.
The same team, from the worst has become the best.
They created the highest structure in the minor time.
So it's important lessons about the nature of the incentives and successful challenge -- why somebody should spend time to write a challenge challenge to write a challenges?
The reason is this: aid to create tools and processes to help groups, video games and effects.
And what makes a challenge challenge is to help identify supposed to be hidded.
Why, honestly, every project has the marshmallow, isn't the way?
The challenges a shared experience, a common experience, a common position to build a prototype to build a prototype.
And so, this is the value of the experience, of this simple exercise.
And those of you who were interested in the marshmallow com.
It's a blog where you can give a look at the marshmallow.
There are spent for the past.
There are examples from all the world about how people correct and add the system.
There is also the record of the world.
And the most important, I think, is that design is really a sport.
It takes the employees of all the sense of all the senses and the sensities and manuality to manuality and manuality to manufacturing the challenge.
And sometimes a small prototype of this experience is all necessarily to transform a "uh-oh-h-h-o-h-h-o-house moment.
And this can really do the difference.
Thank you very much.
We end end up here to have a machine, big, beautiful TED, is a long time machine.
Everybody in this room have to get it.
You can go back, you can go forward; you can't stay where you are.
And I would be curious to know what to choice, because I asked my friends in the last time, and everybody want to go back.
I don't know. They want to come back to before the car or Twitter, or "Twitter."
I don't know.
They're convinced that there is a kind of return, to the illusions.
I understand it.
But I don't part of that group, I have to admit it.
I don't want to go back, and not because I am adventured, it's because the possibilities on this planet don't go back.
So I want to get into the car, and I want to go forward.
This is the best period that there has been on this planet in every field that we can measure measure: healthy, opportunities, opportunities, opportunities, opportunities of disease.
There has never been a period like this.
My grandparents -- all of whatever, before the 60 years.
My grandparent grandparents to 70.
My parents are to touch the 80s.
So it's better than there is a nine at the beginning of my death.
But it's not just about people like us, it's a much bigger than this.
A child born in New Delhi today can expect to live as much as the rich world than 100 years ago.
Think about it. It's an incredible.
How does it be true?
Righ. The smallpox billion people on this planet.
It changed the demography of globe, as no war.
If you went to it.
We have disconft.
In the rich world, diseases of millions of one generation does not exist anymore, in practice.
Difterites, rosolia, policy --
or anybody knows what are they going to do?
Vaccines, modern medicine, our ability to feed billion people, these are trillion of scientific methods.
And second me, scientific method methods, see whether it works, is one of the great results of humanity.
These were the good news.
Unfortunately, they were the good news because there are other issues, and they have been excited many times, for example, one of them is that we got ahead, a billion of people go to this planet, every day.
This number is growing, with incredible incredible, and it's true.
And we did not use our creativity to fill the planet.
As a potaste of plugging plugs, oil forests, oil forests, oil gas, and they are disappearing fast, and they are disappearing our actions to get out of this guys out of this guair out of this guair out of this guys out of this guair out of this guy.
So the question is, can we do it? I think yes.
I think it's clear that it's possible to produce food to feed billion people without violating the land that they live on Earth.
I think it's possible to reforming this world of energy.
I believe that, and no, it's not a illusion.
But here's the thing that keep me at the night -- one of the things that they keep me at night.
We never had to have that needs scientific progress like we need now, and we never have been in the position of how we could today.
We are at a step from incredible events, really, in many ambits.
But yet, I think we should go back, I think we should go back, 300 years before the Illuminism, to find a period in which we have combat the progressively, a period where we do now.
People become into what believe, and they do it with a lot of strength that we couldn't get free them.
We also have to liberate them.
Listen, everyone has been right to their opinion; they also have the opinion progress, but do you know what you have?
You can't tell your facts. I'm sorry, you can't.
I put a little to understand it.
A decade of years ago, I wrote a story about "The New Yorker," a short article.
And I was amazing that somebody opposite opposed to what it is, after all, the measure of the most effective health of human history.
I didn't know what to do, so I've done as the us, I wrote the history, and I went to other.
Don't much later, I wrote a story about genetically modified.
Same thing, just bigger.
People were crazy.
So I wrote a story about that and I couldn't understand why people consider why people considered the OGM like "mostro," because they thought they thought that move molecules, because they thought that would move molecules, instead of work, instead of nature.
But, as I do my job. I do my job.
I mean, I'm a journalist, let's go to the dinner, end up there.
But these stories came back, and I couldn't understand why, but I did it.
The problem was that those fanatics that were making me employees.
They were consciousness, education, people for OK.
They were exactly like people in this room.
And the thing that was very much --
But then I thought, we have to be honest; we're going to be honest on this planet, where we don't have the same relationship with progress.
We talk about the environment.
Let's talk about ironic terms using the virgolets, "Well, there are reasons to do it, and I think that we know what they are.
We have lost in institutions, in the authorities, and sometimes in the authorities that happened.
Just to do some names and people understand it.
Shernobyl, Bhopal, Challenger, Viox, Viox, arms destruction.
I mean, each one has his list.
We have questions and problems with the people that thought had been right.
So you're seeks.
Let's ask the answer to the answer to the answer.
You don't do anything for granted.
But here's the fundamental point when the evidence is necessarily, and we're not very good in this.
And I think the reason is that we find in an epidemic epidemic that I had never seen and hope of not review.
About 12 years ago, a story, a horrible story, a history, who support had a wooden epidemic of autism and the solia.
Many frightening.
Hundreds of studies were made to see if it was true.
And you had to do hundreds of studies; it's a big issue.
They came up with the data.
They came from the United States, from the United States, from the Sweden, and everyone was the equal, no correlationship, no correlationship.
He didn't do the difference. Because we believe to the anecdoes, what we think we can see -- what we think we can see, what we think it makes us feel real.
We don't believe a pile of documents from the government that shows us numbers, and we understand it.
But you know what?
The results are must --
Do you have a fact -- the United States are one of the few countries to the world where the number of vaccines against the dead is hot.
It's horrible, and we should be asking ourselves.
It's terrible.
What happened that has often us to do something like this?
Now, I understand it.
Think about it, somebody here has the morbill?
Somebody in the audience has ever seen a death person die,
It doesn't happen.
In this country, but happened 160,000 times in this country.
It's a bit of deaths of death, 20 every hour.
But since it's not happened here, we can take it from the head, and people like Jenny McCarthy McCarthy can go around to disappears of fear and ignorances like Oprah Larry King Larry King Larry King Live.
And they can do it because they don't understand the difference between causality and correlationship.
They don't understand that these two things seem equal, but they are not almost made.
But it's something that we have to learn, and we have to learn it.
This man was a heroe, Jonas Salk.
He liberated the humanity from one of his worst flows.
No fear, no suffering.
The men to the center, not very high.
It's called Paul Offit.
He simply created a vaccine,
He saved the life of 400, 500 children every year in the development.
My bad, right?
It's eightly if it was not that Paul goes around talking about vaccines, says how much precious and that people should simply stop.
And it tells them in terms.
So Paul is considered a terrorist.
When Paul talks about a public udience cannot be extbox.
They call it because of some place to remind them that they know where his children go to school.
Why? Because Paul created a vaccine.
I don't need to tell them, but the vaccines are fundamental.
If we stay to them, the disease, terrible disease, terrible disease, and it's going on.
We have a new dead in this country.
And it's going to be worse, and between not very children will begin to die again, because it's just a numbers.
And they're not going to die.
The poly? Right? Why not? Why not?
One of my collex colleagues wrote a couple of weeks ago and told me a little excessive.
No one told me before.
She wouldn't vaccinated his son against the polie.
Day.
OK.
Why? Why? Because there's no polies us. But you know what?
We didn't have the polies in the United States.
Today I'm not -- maybe stamine a guy on an airplane to Lake and it's coming to Lake and it's coming to Los Angeles, now, it's over the Ohio.
Maybe it's going to be a couple of hours, it's going to read a machine, it's going to come here to Long Beach one of these fantastics in one of these fantastic fantastic crazed by TED.
He doesn't know to be infected by a paralyzing disease, and we don't even know why it's how the world.
This is the planet where we live in. We live. We don't do it.
We love to do it.
Everybody took the vitamine?
Echine, a bit of antioxidant to start the day.
I know you've done it because the half of Americans do it every day.
They take that stuff, as they deal to the alternative medicine, and not matter how often demonly.
The data.
They realized the most school of this doesn't do anyway.
But it's good, you want to spend 28 billion dollars for school.
Urina school.
Why do we do? Why?
I think we can figure out the big drugs of drugs.
Let's look at the great government machine.
And we do good. Our healthcare system.
It's cruel to millions of people.
It's absolutely, incredibly cold and demoralizing for those of us who can allow.
So do we know far away, and from who we refuge?
We are in the majority of the great placebo.
It's fantastic. We love the great placebo.
You know, it's a serious problem because this stuff is a sket, and we spend billions of dollars.
I have a series of examples here.
None of this -- a woman -- a wood, echinacea -- a wood, I don't know what is but we spend a billion dollars, and it's a well.
Do you know what? When I say these things, people are down, and they say, "What are you interest? Let that people do what you want.
It makes them good."
Can you me? Can you go.
Because I'm not interested in whether it's the secretary of Salute and the U.S. and the United States to say, "Um, I don't mean to listen to the evidence of the mammography or whether it tells the expert of cancer to the patients with clisters at the coffee.
When we deal the streets that leads to replace and evidence with magic and tradition, we end up in a place where we wouldn't want to be.
Let's end as Thabo Mbeki in South Africa.
It killed 400 miles of his concitizens and saying that barbabyetol, and success were going to work better than the anti-retroviral drugs we know they can slow the AIDS.
Hundreds of thousands of inuseful deaths in a country that has been done more from this disease.
Please, you don't come to tell me that there are no consequences for these actions.
There are forever.
Now, the most amazing epidemic that we're in the middle right now is the war between the genetically modified foods, and the biological food and the biological food.
It's a hydiatriba. It's got to fine.
It's a diatrib on the words, the metaphors.
It's not science, it's not science.
Every single thing that we eat, every rise, every rise, every rise, every sweet of Bruxels has been modified by man.
You see, there were no demans in the garden Eden.
There were no melance.
There were no news of Natal. We have created us.
We did it in the last 1111,000 years.
Something worked and something.
And we've been eliminated what he didn't work.
Now we can do it more precise.
And there are risks, of course.
But we can insert things like vitamin the rise, and this would help millions of people, protecting their life.
And we don't want to do this?
I have to tell you, I don't understand it.
We are against the OGM.
Why?
The things that always I feel that I feel compounds, hormons, hormones, we don't want to be an enormous field with the same thing, is wrong.
We don't want that the short companies put on life.
We don't want that the companies are seeds.
You know what my answer to this?
Yeah. You are right.
It's true, we have an enormously, but it's not science.
It has nothing to do with science.
It's read, dead lines on the short of the shorts.
You know that science is not a corporation.
It's not a country.
It's not an idea; it's a process.
It's a process, sometimes it gives a positive results to the year, but the idea that we shouldn't allow the science of doing his work because we have fear is actually a lot of hope.
You know, in the next 50 years, we're going to be able to produce 70 percent of food.
These are investment in Africa of the last 30 years.
Vergogge.
We need it and we don't go.
Why? Cibo genetically modified.
We don't want to encourage people to eat sketches like hand.
As a billion people eat.
It looks like a little bit.
But it just provises calories.
It has no nutrients, it's not proteins, but the scientists are finding the way of insert in this moment.
So a lot of people could eat and less the risk of becoming blind.
They wouldn't house, and you know what?
It would be very beautiful. It would be a restaurant.
I can ask me to ask me, why are we contro?
I mean, what are we hostaculating this thing?
Only why do we don't want to move the genes and there?
It's about moving the genes. It's not about chemists.
It's not about our redicoule obsession for the ormons, or of our desire to have greater food.
They don't get the Rice Kespies.
It's about saving the life of people, and it would be going to begin to understand what it means.
Why do you know? -- if we don't understand it, and we keep behave, and we keep behavior, we're going to be colonies; we will be colonialism.
There is no other way to describe what is going on.
It's horrible, it's horrible, and we have to stop it.
So, after this funny conversation, you could ask myself, you could have to ask myself, and go to the future, and go to the future?"
Of course you want.
It's stuck on the present now, but we have an incredible opportunity.
We can impose the machine.
We have the chance to do it where we want to do it, and we're going to do where we want.
We have to do these conversations, and we have to think, but when we go into the time machine, and we're going to be happy to do it.
I know that we can see, as I think about it.
Thank you.
Thank you.
A day, the Los Angeles Times Steve Los Times Steve Lopez was walking for the streets of Los Angeles when he heard a beautiful music.
He came from a man, an American a-American man a-American training, fascinating trains, without dimore, who played a violin that he had only two cord.
I'm telling a story that many of you know, because the Steve Lopez, the Steve Lopez, which, in the following of a book, which, in the following of Steve Lopez, and Jamie Fox in the Steve Lopez, and Jamie Fox in the Nathaniel Anthony Aythany Ayers, the contrabbbasis of whose putting the Juillie First of the Juillie Fox, and the Juily Ay-bathanthanthan-base F.
Nathaniel leaving the Juilliard, had a terrible exhaustment, and 30 years later lived as a without the streets of Skid Rings in the middle of Los Angeles.
Even all of you to read the Steve or or to look at the movie to understand the movie to understand not just the beautiful wood.
I call Jane McGonigal. They're a games.
I realize online from 10 years and my goal for the next 10 years and my goal for the next decade is to try to save the world in real life.
So I have a plane, and consists in convincing more people, coming all of you, to spend more beautiful and interesting games and interesting.
We past three billion hours to the week playing online.
Some of you could think, "It's a good time to play."
maybe too long time, considering how many urgent issues we have to solve in the real world.
And in fact, in my research, I pressure, I mean, the Istitute for the Futuro, is actually the contrary.
Three billion hours are not minimally enough to solve the most urgent problems.
In fact, I believe that if we want to survive the next century on this planet, we have to increase.
I calculated that total we need is 21 billion hours of play every week.
It's probably a connection to a counterintuitive, so the repeat, to reenforce the concept.
If we want to solve problems that families, the poverty, climate changes, obesity, of global climate changes, obesity, I think we have to have the environment of playing online to play online for the next week of the next few decade.
Here's why. This image is why I think it's so important to play is so important to the survival of human species.
This is a photographer Phil Toldan, wanted to capture the emotion of the game.
So he photograph of the players.
And this is an emotion.
If you don't have the habitual players is possible that you lost some of the pictures of this picture.
You can probably notice the sense of urgence, a little bit of fear, but also an intensive, a very profound attention, a very profound attention, a very difficult.
If you are players, you'll notice some details, you will notice around the mouths, and around the mouth are a sign of optimism.
And the surprising surprise.
This is an abitual player.
Ah, it's a term that you've heard. Okay. OK.
So we have the abitual players between us.
One of lifetime is a result that extraordinarily that you don't seem to be possible untien.
It's almost almost beyond of the imagination, and when you get a shock shock. This is a shock life. This is an epicture.
This player is a step from a liftary.
And this is the expression that we need to see the millions of absolute problems in the world while we deal with the obstacles of the next hundred years. The expression of somebody which, against the expression of somebody which, against all of the expectations.
Unfortunately, this is the expression that we see in all days as we try to deal with urgent problems.
This is the expression that I call "Nella Realt" -- I'm not going to do it.
I am with the expression "I'm not Brun Nella Realty."
This is a degree in my Berkeley, California, where I did the Ph.D., where I did the Ph.D. Because we are more good in life.
And this is a lot of habitual players: we feel that we're not good as well.
And I don't mean "good success" as "succes," even though the successful is particular, we get more results in the line of the worlds.
But I mean, "braves in the sense of motivated to do something important, inspired to collaborate and cooperating.
And when we are in a online world, I think a lot of us become the best versions of themselves, the most capable of helping without predicted, more capable of concentrate on a problem for all the time to be realing after a failure and try and new way.
And in real life, when we face a failure, when we dealing a obstacle obstace, we don't feel like this, we feel about, we feel anxious, we feel depressed, and we feel depressed, frustrated or Chcycle or Chilycle or whatever.
We never feeling these feelings while we don't exist in a game.
So this is what I wanted to study to university.
What is that in a game of feel that we can't get any result?
How can we get those feeling from games and appling them to the real?
So I studied a games like World of Warcraft, which is really the environment ideal to solve problems.
And I started to notice some things that make lives so possible, so possible in the online.
The first is that, when you appear to one of these games, especially in World of Warcraft, there are lots of different peoples that flows up to the point of a mission to save a mission to save the world.
But not a mission -- a perfectly mission to your current levels in the game. Right?
So you can complete.
They never give you a challenge.
But it's at the limits of your capacity. So you have to be seriously.
But there's no ccupation in World of Warcraft, you don't get the time to turn the pollics, there's always something specific and important to do it.
And there's also a lot of collaborators.
Everywhere hundreds of thousands of people, ready to join your head.
It's not a common thing in real life, this sense that we have a lot of collaborators.
And there's also this narrative, this narrative that inspire that inspired inspire that inspired inspire, and what we're doing.
And then we get this positive feedback to --
you've heard of increasing levels and spreading a spreads of settling.
We don't get that kind of expensive feedback in real life.
When I leave this stage not going to have to talk about a public, and I'm going to talk about a public ideas.
I don't get that kind of feedback in real life.
Now, the problem of the collaborative environments like World of Warcraft is that gives so much sodden to be a step from a liftypical life, which we decide to spend all the moment, that we decide to spend the time in these game.
It's just better than reality.
It's because of that, collectively all the World of Warcraft of Warcraft went 5.93 million years to solve the virtual problems.
This is not necessarily something negative.
But put it in perspective, 5.93 million years ago was the period where one of our ancestors was the period where one of our ancestors.
This was the first primary to walk her.
Okay, so when we're talking about how long we are investing in playing, the only sense of course, is to talk about it, it's about talking about times the human evolution, which is a very extraordinary, but it also useful, because we discovered that passing all the time to play, we're going to be evolved to collaborate what we're able to collaborate more cues.
This is true, I believe it.
So let's look at this interesting statistics.
It's been recently published by a researcher at Carnagie Mellon.
The typical young people, today in a country with a strong culture of players, will have spent 10,000 hours play line, at 21.
10,000 hours is a very interesting number of two reasons.
First of all, for the children in the United States 10,080 hours of hours to school if you're present every day.
We have an entire education of educational education in which young people learn how to be a great player to the schools in the schools in which learn all the remains.
And some of you will probably read the new book of Malcolm Gladwell, "Fuorics."
If you've done it has read of his theory of success, the theory of the 10,000 hours for success.
It's based on a very good research in the cognition in the cognition that if we dedicated 10,000 hours of a fraction that if we're going to be about 21-year-old genes of genes in that field.
All of course in that something like the best people in the world.
So, what we have now to do is a whole generation of a girl generation of the games.
So, the question is, "Exactly, what do you get these play?"
because if we could understand what it's about what we're going to be able to resources of human resources without precedent.
This is the number of people in the world.
These are our genes of games.
500 million people who are extraordinarily -- in something.
And in the next decade is going to have another billion players that are extraordinarily that are extraordinarily.
If you already knew about it, this is what we expect the video games is developing platform that consuming energy and that work with the cell phone and that working with the cell phone network, in particular big, particular, particularly in India, particularly in India, particular, particular, particular connection.
The estimate is a billion of players in the next decade.
This will be about 1.5 billion players.
So I began to think about what these games are transforming us into genes.
These are four aspects that I individual.
Okay.
A very optimism people are the desire to act immediately to act a obstactly obstacking, together with convinced conviction of success.
The players create always believe that a liftype is possible and that is possible and worth about trying to do it.
The players are not with hands in the hands.
The habitual players are virtuos in a social trains.
There are a lot of interesting research that we have better with other people after them, even though they have been played with them.
And the reason is that it takes a lot of trust to play with somebody to play with somebody's going to game their time with the same rules and with the same rules with the same evidence of the game.
So, to play together, construction confidences and cooperation.
We really have more social relationships.
It's game.
You know, there's a reason for which the World of World of Warcraft player 22 hhours to the week, almost like a part---
It's because we know while we're playing, while we're playing more happier working with, rather than relaxing or losing time.
We know that we're optimized to be optimized to work soon to do something that has meaned.
And the abitual players are willing to work sophistly, if it's assigned an adaptop.
Finally, a significant.
The players love to be associated to be associated with wonderful humans on the planetaria.
For example, a small information to help create a context.
You all know Wikipedia, the biggest wiki Wikipedia, the greatest wiki in the world.
The second biggest in the world, with almost 80,000 articles is the wiki wiki wiki World of Warcraft Chinese people use it every month.
They reached more information on World of Warcraft in the Internet, that on any other people in the world.
They're building a epical work.
They're building a source of information about World of Warcraft.
Okay, these are four superpowers that together and constituent one thing.
The abitual players are individuals of great super-poor.
These are people who believe to be individually able to change the world.
The only problem is they create to be capable of changing virtual worlds, but not real.
This is the problem that I'm trying to solve.
There is a Edward Castronove.
Her studies are brilliant. She's study why people invested so much long, energy and money in the money online.
He says, "We are looking at what the constituency is nothing less than a mass exodd exodd and the environments and the play line."
And it's a rational economy, so it's rational, and it -- not like me, I'm a games, I'm exuberant, I'm exuberant, I'm exuberant,
But he says, he says this is a perfectly sense of this is a perfectly sensed by the online that in real life.
They can have more social relationships in a game that not in real life.
They got a better feedback to a better feedback to a play that not in real life.
So now, for now, it's perfectly reasonable for the players, to spend more time in the virtual worlds in the virtual world's real-world's agree that this is rightly reason for now, but it's not in any ways, a ideal situation we have to start to make the world more similar to a game.
Here is the inspiration from something that happened 2500 years ago.
These are from ancient ancies, in facts of host Prima to have joystics and clean wonderful joyed and clear wonderful tools from humanity.
If you know about the ancient writts, Erodod, and you know this story.
It's the story of who invented games and why.
Erodot that games, in particular, in particular games of the games of the Lidia, during a period.
Lidia decided to be severe, that the Lidia decided to do something impensive.
People have suffered the population was in revolted, they needed an extreme solution.
So the Erodot, invented the games of and emanate a valid laws for all the regards.
A day, everyone would eat.
The next day, everyone would play.
And they dived so deeply in the games of the games that play is so involved in a game state of game, and diving us in a game.
And so one day they were played and a day they eat.
And second Erodod, they spend so 18 years, surviving a day and playing the following a day and playing the following.
I think this is exactly the way we use the games of today.
We use the games to the suffering.
We are the games for real, and we get what does not working in our real environmental environment, and we get what we need from real, and we get what we need from games.
But we don't necessarily to stop here.
This is a very interesting part of Erodod, after 18 years, the caresty wouldn't get to be played a last part, so while they were going to played a last work.
They live the entire given in the half, they played a wall, and the winners of that participate to a well.
And they left the Lidia and they went to try to bring a new Earth where to live, leaving behind the resources of people to survive with the resources of people to survive, with hope to bring their civilization, with hope.
Is a little bit, right?
But this stuff in the DNA revealed that the Etrusks that the Etrusks that they would brought to the same DNA of the ancient DNA of the ancient Lidia.
So sciently scientists have suggested that the story of Erodoto Erodot is a real story.
And geologists have found evidence of a global global room that during almost 20 years.
So this incredible story could be true: they could have saved their own culture, refugee in the games for 18 years to be so inspired in 18 years to be so inspired and know how well coming up to save so the whole civilization.
Okay, we can do it.
I call the Warcraft from 1994.
It was the first game strategy of World of World of Warcraft. This 16 years ago.
They were played by 18, we have played Warcraft for 16 years.
I mean, we're ready for our epic game.
They would see the research of the population of a new world.
It's where 21 billion hours of 21 billion hours of game.
Let's do that in the half of us agree to spend a day to play, until the day to play, until the real world.
Imagine what you're going to ask, "How do we do to solve the problems of the real world in a game?" Well, this is what I dedicated my work during the last last years, pressure Istitute for Future.
In our Palo Alto we have this stendardo that express our idea of how we should relate with the future.
We don't want to try to predict the future.
What we want to do is -- the future.
We want to imagine the scenaries from the best results and then we want to give the chance to people to transform them.
We want to imagine victories to get to people to realize them.
I'm going to show you very short three games that I realized and I'm a attempt to the tools to create epigs in their future.
This is "Midd."
We did this game in 2007.
It's an online that you try to survive a charge of oil.
The charge is not real, but we published enough material material that is, and to make real life as the real life as if we were in the six. So when you go into the six. So when you go into the area that area that are exactly news that showing the exactly news in real, data that shows the oil cost of the oil, things that are not available, things that are not availablished on the food, things that are not available to the food of the food,
The impact on the transports, if you have clear schools, and you've got to think about how you live your life would be living your life if all this was real. Dopoder you to have a blog on video -- you know, to advertising video --
We had this game with 1,700 players in 2007, and we observed them for the three years, and what I can say is that it's an experience.
No one wants to change the way they live because it's a good thing for the world or because it's a good thing.
But if you diving them in a wind and says, "We have no oil.
This is an amazing story that you can tell you,
You challenge to see how to survive."
Most of our players had kept the habits that has learned in the game.
So, for the next game, we decided to save the world, we decided to mirate more than oil.
We realized a game called Superstruct to Istitute for the Futuro, and the premise was: a supercomputer has only another 23 years on this planet.
The supercomputer was called "Sistema's Sistema Globale." Ovviously.
We asked people to reach people to achieve almost like a movie of Jerry Bruckheimer.
You know the movies of Jerry Bruckheimer, shapes a team from dream: there is an astronaut, the scientist, and they all have something to do to save the world, but in our play, instead of having five people in the team, but instead of having five people in the team, the future of course, the future of the energy, the future of energy, the future of the healthy, the future, the future, the future of health, the future,
8,000 people have played for eight weeks, they generated 500 solutions that you can find if you go online and try to Google "Superstruct."
Finally, the last game, it's going to bego. This is a realized play with the Istitute of the Mondial.
If you completed the game, you will be certified by Istitute of the World Bank, like Social, class of 2010.
By working with universities for sub-Saharan Africa, we're inviting them to learn the techniques of social innovation techniques.
There is a story about comic levels of skills to the local knowledge, collaboration, sustainability, the imagination and the inventibility, the imagination and the inventive.
I give all of you to invite all of you to share this game with young people, in particularly areas in the developing areas of the developing areas, which could benefit from the until to begin to begin to imagine of their own impresely social to save the world.
It's now to conclude.
I want to ask a question.
What do you think is going to happen?
We have all these incredible players, we have these games that are about what we could do is, but no one of these has saved the real world.
Well, hopefully that you agree with me that players are a resource that we can use to do the work in the real world in the real, which games are a platform for change, that the games are a powers, that we have these incredible super-powers, a game, the ability to be a robust, and the desire that to be a meaning of a meaning epi.
I really hope that we can come up with games to play games that have importance, to survive on this planet for another century, and my hope is that you to myself and my hope is that you to myself and participating games.
When I look at the next decade of two things are certain: that we can make any future, and that we can imagine, and that we can play anywhere we can play anywhere we want.
So, I begin to the games that will change the world.
Thank you.
For some time I am interested in placebe, it can seem a strange thing that a magician effect from my view point of view is something from my view is something reales." In other words, to become something reale." In other words, the pills of bizeros of bizero effect in some studies, the placeal effect in some studies, the placeal effect, because the person thinks --
what's happening is happening is had to a drug or something like --
The therapia, for example, if they believe they have a measurable effect.
Something becomes something true for perception that if you have.
I want to show you a magic of magic trick, very simple.
And I'm going to show you how it works. This is a trick that is in all the books for children in the 19-year-olds.
I learned from only with Cub Scout Magic in the 190s.
And I'll execk it for you and then I will explain it.
And so I'm going to explain why I explained it.
Here's what happens.
The typically you can examine, my hand, that you can examine.
I'm going to simply the color in my pug, like this.
I go to the hand.
To be sure that nothing scene.
Now I'm string my pole.
And so you can see that something that can pas. She string here is nothing goes on or down to my hand.
And the purpose of this is simple.
I go to open my hand, and if everything has good, my magnetism will be magnetism,
And in fact, so I save to his place that I can school, and the couple doesn't fall.
No goes on to my hand.
no trick. You can examine anything.
Ta-day!
This is a trick that often inner to the children.
that they are interested in the magic because you can learn a lot about the ingdom is very simple.
Many of you in this room will know this trick.
So this is what Tengo into my hand.
I say to save my pole.
to make sure that nothing to be saving or from my man, this is a good thing.
The reason I keep the pole is because this secret of illusion.
And in the moments that my hand moved away from you, this gathering here, my indicates from you, in a position, in a position, in a position, in a position.
There is somebody who had no childhood.
This is the right.
And when I also move the dit goes up.
We can talk about why it's nevolution, because you don't notice that there are only three fingers, and the way that the information, and the way the information process that information.
But this is not the point. Right? And when my hand, Ovviously remain not through the magnetism, but across the engineering here, but through the well.
And when I close my fingers are now, when I go back, this movement, this movement.
Many view of the hand.
It's a trick that you can do with your friends. Thank you.
Now, what has to do to do with the placeby?
I read a year ago that a year ago that shoulder.
I'm not a medical or a researcher, which was a surprising.
It seems that if you administrates a place in the shape of a white pill, just a white pill, just a white pill, has a size.
But if you change the shape and you give the shape of a smaller pill, and blue color, and blue a letter is visible.
Even if no one of the two has no drug ddrug of sugar.
But a white pill, it's not effective like a blue.
What? It really got me down.
But anyway, it's not here that end.
The caps are more effective than every form.
A colored capsule that it's giving to a part and the other is better than a white capsule.
The dose has a role.
A statistics a day is not so effective like three pills -- I don't remember the statistics.
But the point is --
that these dosages have a now.
And the shape has a role.
And if you want to be the definitive placebad you have to use a near.
Right? A siringes with something -- a couple c.m.
you inject in a patient --
This is an image so stronger in their mind, much more than the white pill.
It's real, this graphic -- I'm going to show you another time when we're going to have slide.
The point is that the white pillar is not effective like that blue that is not effective as the capsult, which is not a near ago.
And no one of these has a drugs.
It's just your real believe that makes real in your cover and rafforts the effect.
I wanted to see if I could take this idea and apply it to a magic trick.
And do something that is a finish trick and make it seems real.
And we know from the study that when you want to be able to use the needs.
This is a seven spillon.
It's a little bit.
This is my card. This is not a special Damian.
This is my skin. This is not a special effect effect.
I am to holding my skin and get this age, until to the opposite part of the opposition.
If you go to -- if you feeling -- if you get to be easy -- I did for some friends in the alberge, and for some that I didn't know it, and a woman is almost sent woman is almost there.
So if you tried to be easy to suggest that you don't look for the next 30 -- in fact, you know, I'm going to do the first part of the butter.
You can see you, you can look from another side.
Here's what happens, right here, the beginning of my card at the bottom part of my arm. I do a little dark.
Let's impressing up?
And now a little bit through my skin, and out of the other side, like this.
Now, we're in the same position where we were with the trick of the crows.
More or less but you can't count my fingers now, right?
So you've got the most. Here's two three, four, five She's good.
I know what people think about when they see that.
They think, "It's not going to be quite stupid to the skin the skins of minute."
So, let me leave you to let you give a short.
How do you see? Abastic good.
Yes, I know the behind will tell you."
People in the rooms are going on.
Let me show you neighbor.
This is a very special effect of Hollywood.
This is my care, and I can turn it around.
Sorry, if you feel like you look at another side, you don't look at it.
People in the bottom or that will look at a few years, "Well, it's clear that a few effect, but if it's true --
You can see a hole here and a hole hole here, if it was true blood."
Okay, now I get a little blood for you.
Here's here.
Normally now let the age.
I would have my arm, and I would show you that there are no stop.
But I think in this context and with the idea of taking something true, and get it into something true, and I'm going to let it is, and I'm going to go from the stage.
We will see different times in the next days, I hope you can't see the now. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
So, in my life, I met a lot of fish.
I just loved two.
The first one is more than a passional story.
It was a beautiful fish knowledge, one of the largest to the menu.
What fis!
And what's better, it came from a product of standards, the most elevates of sustainabilities.
So, you feel to be with the consciousness to sell it.
I was involved in a relationship with this beauty for different months.
A day, the head of the company called me and asked me to talk to a dedicated event of the dedicated environment.
"Yeah."
This was a company that was trying to solve what was to solve what has become a problem for our chefs.
How do we keep the fish in our menu?
During the last 50 years, we've fished in the same way that we have to the ground.
The destruction has been tremendous.
90 percent of the great fish, the ones that we like so much the tuns, the halibuts, the heavy fish is dramatically fought in the number.
There is no remaining almost nothing.
So we like it or less the water, the fish, the fish, it will become part of our future.
There are lots of arguments.
The fish of fish weighborhood for the least most of them, and they're inefficient. Take the ton for example.
A great problem is that there is a conversion of food conversion of 15 to one.
This means that it takes about 15 libers wild fish to get a book.
It's not very sustainable.
And the knowledge.
This is where we finally had a company that was trying to do it in the right way.
I wanted to help them.
The day before I got phone to the audience.
Let's ask Don.
"Don," I said, "much to understand it, you are famous to do it, you are famous to do so far aheads."
"We are so long, he said, "we're so far from the coast that our doctors, not concentraties."
And then he said, "We're basically a world to part."
"The conversion? 2.5 to one."
"The best in the sectors."
2.5 to one, fantastic.
"2.5 to one thing? What do you do to eat the fish?"
"Protein sustainable.
"Gree," I said,
Which at night, I was in bed, I thought, what the hell is a sustainable protein?
So the day later, I could first of the event, I called Don.
I said, "Don, do you do some examples of sustainable proteins?"
She said he didn't know it, and that would ask him.
Well, I talked to a few of the company and no one set to give me a precise.
And until finally talked to the biologist.
We also call him.
"D," I said, "Do you get some examples of sustainable proteins?"
Well, he mentioned some algaa few basis of fish, and then he said, "Prazy of poll."
I said, "Do you take a chicken?"
He said, "Yeah, pay, hox, shoot down, dropped and processed processed to e."
I said, "Which is the percentage of your eating eat?"
I thought, let's say, the two percent.
"Well, it's about 30 percent."
I said, "Don, what is there is sustainable to drive to the fish of the chicken?"
There was a long puses to the telephone and then said, "There are very polls in the world."
I told me about this fish.
No, not because they are one of those virtuous foods.
Well, to say the truth.
No, in fact, I told me about this fish because, I turn him after that conversations, the fish of poll.
The second fish is a different love story.
It's a romantic story that kind of history that kind of history that kind of history that kind of history.
I eating it for the first time in a restaurants in the south of Spain.
My friend of mine journalist was talking about this fish.
And basically had to meet.
He came to the table, he had a white brilliant color, almost sparking.
The chef chef of it.
Basically, the doppie of how it was cotted.
It was a delightly delecture.
Who is able to make a fish so good after having it down?
I no, but this guys.
Let's ask Miguel.
It's called the Miguel.
No, he didn't have the fish, and it's not a chef.
For the less, not in the sense that we mean by usual.
It's a biologist in Veta Palma which is a fish of the Western corner of Spain the Guadalquivir.
Until the 1980s at the time.
They were basically based on what before was essentially a paludoxy.
They had given the Earth building a series of channels of connecting the water in the river.
Well, they couldn't do it works the thing not from the economic point of view.
And, from the ecological point of view.
He killed something like 90 percent of the birds of bird birds of birds.
So, in 1982, a company with a space environmental consciousness I'm going to buy the ground.
What do they do?
They get the flow of water.
They literally, they invertive the whole ruter.
Instead of consciousness water from the ground using the channels.
They're giving all of the channels.
They created a fish of fish from 27 miles, drinks, drunning and in this process, and in this process, Miguel and this company, Miguel and this instruction.
The thing is incredible.
I mean, you never see something like this.
Look at the horizon that seems to be away a billion and all that you see are the channels and that recognizes and recognized.
I was there a little time ago with Miguel.
It's an amazing kind of three Charles Darwin and a quarter Crocodile Darwin and a quarter Crocodile Darwin and a quarters.
Okay? We were made in the middle in the middle of this lake, I had the knees and Miguel, he had the knees and Miguel, he had his biology.
First I mean a white rare nibe.
Then me explains the minerals of the mineral fitos, then he can see a kind of fish of fish that reminds of the Tanzania.
Sothers out that Mikuel has spent the most of his career at the National Park, Mikur Mikur in Africa.
I asked them as a fish.
He said, "What? I don't know about fish.
They're an expert in relation."
And it turns out to be rary, algae, algae and strange plants.
Don't be fascinating, all this was very fascinating, one thing like the biotic community community,
Yeah, it's interesting, but I was in love with it.
And my head was continued to rethink about that weighing the weight that I had the previous night that I had the previous evening.
So the interrups and said, "Miguel, what makes your fish so goo?"
He indicated the algaes.
"I know, the algae, the algae, the fitos, yeah, incredible.
But your fish what they eat?
What is your conversion?
Well, makes me tell you about how their is a rich system so rich that the weights eat exactly what they would eat a wild environment.
The biomass of the plants, the fito-plankton, the zooplankton is all about the fish.
The system is so healthic health is completely.
There are no eats.
Can you ever heard of a wall that gives not to eat his animals?
More tardies, I was driving around the ground with Miguel and I said, "In a place like this seems so natural different from any of whatever you see, like to measure success?"
And in that moment, as though the regist of a movie of the set.
We had a corner, and we saw a scene between the incredible thousands and thousands of thousands and thousands of phenicotters of the eye.
"What is the successful succes,"
"Look at their pances, they're red.
They're bank."
Banks? I was completely confused.
I said, "Miguel, but they're not bankling with your fish?"
"Yeah, he said, "Yeah.
"Let's take about 20 percent of the fish and the fish of birds.
Last year on this property, there were 600,000 bird birds of 250 species.
It has become the biggest and one of the most important healthcare for birds in the whole Europ."
I said, "Miguel, but a population population, is not the final population of birds that would like you want to in a fish?"
He knows the head, no.
And he said, "We get extensive in a very extensive way.
This is an ecological network.
The phenicopter eats.
The ramberes eat the plankton.
So the longer is the bread of the phenicopter is the system."
Okay, then we reassummit to eat his animal and measure his animals and measured the health of his predators.
A fish of fish, but also a health for birds.
Oh, by the way, those phenicotters should not even there.
They do the nest in a longer town, 150 miles where the conditions of the soil is better for the building.
Every morning, they fly fly for 150 miles and they get to the returns to the return.
They do it because they're able to following the white line of A92.
On seriously.
I can imagine something like the size of penguins so we looked at Miguel.
And I said, "Miguel, they fly fly for 150 miles until and they flew 150 miles away?
Do they do it for the little bit.
And he looked at me as though a song of Whitney Houston.
He said, "No, they do it because the food is better."
I talked to you about the skin of my fish that was deless, and I usually don't like the skin the fish.
I don't like a crum, I don't like chrocking.
It's that knowledge.
Don't the kitche,
And yet, when I asked it in that south Spain the Spain of Spain for nothing of fish.
He had a sweets and cleaned was like to give a death.
I said to Miguel, and he annuy.
He said, "The skin is like a shoulder.
It's the last defense before anything in the fish.
It's evolved to treat the purity."
And then added "but our water is not impurity."
Okay. A advallation that doesn't feed his fish.
A measure that measures the success of its predators.
And then I realized that when he says, he tells the wouldn't minid very much of the thing because the water drinks that fluis in that event comes from the river, which is a river, which is a river, which is a river, which is all the things that the rivers can bringing today contaminants.
And when it turns the system and it is more clean the water is more than when it is indeed.
The system is so healthy, which is the water.
So, not just a wall of the inevation that doesn't feed his animals not just a higher that measures his predators in the health of his predator, but a health of water and not only for the fish of water and not only for me and not only for me and for me to you.
Because when the water exce, if you get in the Atlantic.
It's a drop in the ocean, I know it, but I know the good, and so you should do why this story of love as a romantic story.
You could say it's a recept for the future of the food that bag is that they are about fish that boms.
What we need is a radically new conceptional conceptional conceptional conception.
But for many people, this is a little too radical.
We are not realists, we are passionate the food.
We are loant.
Let's love markets.
Let's love little familiar farmers.
Let's talk about the local food.
We are biology.
And when you say that these are the things that will make sure the future of good food, and says, "Hei your food and says, "Ehi your floors and says, "Hey, you think you can feel the whole world?
How do you think we can feed the world?"
Can I think of it?
It's a question that I don't like it.
No, not because we have already more than enough calories to feed the world.
A billion people suffer today.
One billion -- more than there are ever -- because of the enormous address in the distribution of not for the complex.
You see, I don't like this question, because he determined the logic of our food system in the last 50 years.
To cereal to the pesticide of pestics, chemicals, chemics to the fish and the whole period, the industry simply has simply simply clean is simply clean to be wrong, what are we going to do it?"
This was the motivation.
It's been the justify.
It's been the business of American agriculture.
We should call it for what it is, a liquid industry that is a speed industry that is speeding the ecological capital that makes ecological capital.
This is not an industry, and it's not agriculture.
Our panium is threatened not because of the forest instance, but for the resources in declinic, but for the last invention, but for the fertile, not for the pumps, not for the pumps, but for water water and not for the fish water and not for the fish, but for the fish of the fish, but for the fish of the fish.
You want to feed the world?
Let's start asking ourselves, how will we feed?
Or better, how can we create the condition to every local communities of feed community?
To do that, we don't look at the model of industry model of the future.
It's an old model.
Everything about capital, chemistry and machines, and he never really produced anything to eat.
Instead, we look at the ecologic model
It's what counts about two billion years of work.
Let's look at Miguel, like Miguel, like Miguel allevements and farmers that are no money in the fact that they reconsumption that are instead of consuming extensively intensively instead that only intensive extensively intensively, because they are the ones that are also experts in the knowledge.
If I have to be very much better than I'm going to be a better chef of how I'm going to be me.
You know, in me good, because if that's going to be the future.
Thank you.
I grew up with a stop diet.
As I took a school.
And I was always immersed in a book, a book of phantascience, which was bringing my mind in other worlds, and satisfiable sense of curiosity that I had.
And that curiosity's manifested in the fact that every time I was out in school, for hunters to the samples of samples and stagners, I would brought them to the microscoping them to the microscopie.
I was a real geek of science.
But it was always trying to figure out the world, understanding the limits.
And my love for the phantascience in fact, seemed to respeck the world around me, because what was going on in the late 1960s -- we were were going to go to the moon, we were going to the moon of the oceans of the oceans, Jacques Cousteau was exploring with his fantastics and places that show us animals and a wonderful world.
So, it seemed to be informing my passion for the phantascience.
And I was a artist.
I knew to draw. I knew to paint it.
And since there were no video games this saturation of the movie generated movie of the media, I had to create these pictures in my head.
As a children, when we read a book, all of the description of the author, put something about the screen on the screen of our tests.
And so, my answer was paings, drawing creatures, robots aliens, robots, robots, all this stuff.
The mathematics of mathematical lessons behind the book.
This is because the creativity had to find a view in some way.
And this happened a very interesting thing about the Jacques Cousteau programs.
Maybe I would never go to a alien world.
It seemed very improbable.
But that was a world where I could go to really, right here on Earth, the richer of what I could ever imagine these books.
So, I decided that I would become a such of 15 years.
And the only problem was that I live in a small country of Canada, 600 miles from the ocean neighbor.
But I didn't left score.
I assilled my father until has found a school of immers in Buffalo, New York, appends where we live.
And so I managed to take the certified in a foot of YMCA in the YMCA in Buffalo, New York.
And I wouldn't see the ocean, for another two years, until we moved to California.
Since then, in the last -- 40 years, I spent about 3,000 hours underwater, and 500 of these hours in submersible.
And I learned that the depth of the ocean, even profound the oceans, are surprising life that really goes to the side of our imagination.
The imagination of nature is without respect to our human imagination.
Agained by what I'm seeing when I do the immersions.
And my love story of love with the ocean continues, more than ever before.
But when I choose a career from adult, I chose to do film.
And it seemed to be the best way to conciliate this smany, to tell stories with the smany.
And, as I was draw and so on.
So making movie was the only way to put together and stories.
All right.
And of course, the stories that I've choseveral stories of telling were stories of fantascience, "Aliens" and "The Aliens."
And with "The Abys" and I put my love for the depth and immers with the realization of a movie.
So, I did the two passions.
From "The Abys" has come out of something interesting that was solving a specific problem in that film, which is to create that kind of water creating that kind of water liquid water.
And so he was born the first characters and souled to the computer that had ever seen in a movie.
And even though the movie has not done a lot of money, I would say, I was repaid of something extraordinary public was hypnotized by this apparent.
You know, it's the Arthur Clarke Clarke for any technology sufficiently advanced is instinguible by the magia.
They were seeing something magic
And that has excited about it.
And I thought, "Fantastic, this is a thing that needs to be adopted in the movie art.
So, with "Terminator 2," my next movie, we went very much beyond it.
Lavoring with the Industrial Light and Magic, we created the guy in that movie.
And it worked. And we have created a magia.
And we got the same result with a audience.
But we had a little bit more with that movie.
So, in a line between these two experiences of experience, they came to the conclusion that this would be a new world of creativity for the artists of the movie for artists.
Homdi, I put it into a society with Stan Winston, my friend Stan Winston, which was the main Stan Winston, which was the main of that period, and we called Domain.
And the principle of society was to let us to the past, the analog processes and so on.
And so we did and made us a competitive advantage for a while.
But we are remained back to the middle of creatures and characters and characters, which is what we had founded the society.
So, I wrote this textbook called "Avatar" with the intention of push effects, generated to the massive effects and realistic characters and all the main generated computers, and all the main generated computers, and all the main generated computers.
And the whole thing has been remained to the myth.
The kids of the society have told me that we're not going to be able to do it for a bit.
So, I accurate it and I made this movie of a clear ship.
At the study of it as a "Romeo and Giuliet on a ship."
It would be a story, a passional story, a passional movie.
Segretly, what I wanted to do was to immers to see the report.
That's why I did that film.
And it's the truth. I study not it.
But I said, "We're going to go to the network.
We're going to use it for the beginning of the movie.
It's going to be very important. It's going to be a marketing of marketing."
And I convinced them to financiating a middle.
It seems like that. But this leads back to the imagination that creates the reality.
Because we really created a reality and six months after I reached on a submersible Russian and a half half of the North Atlantic in the North Atlantic -- not in the high, not in the high, not in the high, but for reall.
I'm stayed.
And there's a lot of preparing a lot of preparation, we had to build a lot of other things.
But they remained by the deep deep deepers, was like a space.
where everything was highly technical and requires required.
You putting you in this chape, you go to this buy environment where there are no hopes of being saved to be saved to be saved, which you can't go back.
And I thought, "Fantastic. It's like to live in a fantascience.
It's really fantastic.
And so, I was a dead of the depth of the depth of the deep ocean.
Of course, the curiosity, scientific component
It was everything. It was the adventure.
It was curiosity. It was imagination.
And it was an experience that Hollywood wrong.
Of course, I could imagine a creature and make a visual effect. But I couldn't imagine what I would see out of the obble.
In our success, I saw creatures with hydrothermal hydrothermal -- things that I had never seen before, things that had never seen before, things that had ever seen before, which was not even described by science to the evidence, and imagine.
So I was all taken from this and I had to do more.
So I got a curious decision.
After the success of "Titanic," I said, "OK, I'm going to part of my daily work, from Hollywood regist of Hollywood, and I do the explorer to a while.
So, we started to planning these expeditions.
We had to go to Bismark to Bismark and explore it with robotic roboties.
We went back to Titanic.
We took small robots that we had created with an optic.
And the idea was to go inside and do a survey surface of the ship that never been done.
No one had ever watched inside of the relitt. They didn't have a means to do it, so created the technology to do it.
And I came to the bridge of Titanic, sitting in a submersible, and looking at the asses that looked like this, where I knew that they had played the violinists.
And I'm driving a small robotic vehicle in the corridor of the ship.
When I say that, I'm driving it, but my mind is in the vehicle.
It seemed to be physically present within the relitt.
And it was the experience of the most surreal surreal that that has ever lived there, because before you already before we knew what would be behind the lights of the vehicle of the vehicle of the vehicle for months to running the movie.
And the set was based on a replace of the model.
So it was an absolutely experience.
And it really really made me that in the telepresence of the telepresence of the telepresence that you can experience, the mind is inject in the vehicle in the vehicle of existence.
It's been very profound.
And it could be a small assage of what could happen between some decade when we begin to begin to have a cyborg for the explorations or other reasons in some kind of future-humans that I can imagine, from the amount of phantascience that I can imagine, from the phantly one of the point.
So, we did these expeditions, and we really started to appreciate what there was underneat, like the depth of the depth of the ocean where these stay animals.
Basically, they're aliens on Earth.
They live in a environment.
They're not going to survive in a sunlight of the sunlight of the sunlight of the sunlight of the sunlight.
So, you see animals that live close to running water running at 500 degrees.
It seems even impossible that they exist.
At the same time I was interesting very interesting science, again, again, it's the influence of the science, as a girl.
And they finished in space environment with NASA, sitting in the consultive of NASA, stay planning to Russia, to go to Russia, to go to Russia, to spend biomedical biomedical biomedical environment.
It's been fascinating.
But what I finished to do is to bring scientists with us in the absolute.
And to bring them down because they could have accessous -- astrobiology scientists, people interested in these extremely interested in these extreme environments and allowing them and allowing them and so on.
So we were turning to documentary documentary science, we actually had the science, the space science,
I had to ask the ring between being fan of the fan of phantascience, to do those things for it.
And you know, during this path of discover, I learned a lot of it.
I learned a lot of science. But I learned a lot about leadership.
Everybody thinks that a leader, the ability to be a leader, the ability of the ship, or something like that.
I didn't know anything about leadership before I do all those expeditions.
Why am I going to say, "What am I going to do it?
Why am I doing? What do you get this?"
Don't anything to do all these spectacs.
Let's go to part.
People think about that I went between "Titanic" and "Avatar" and "Avatar" and "Avaden the chickens.
I did all these documentaries for a public audience.
No fama, no gloria, no money. What am I doing?
I'm doing it for the tasks, for the challenge -- and the ocean is the largest challenge that exist, for the brilliance of discover, and for that strange instay when a small group of people shape a deep team.
Because we had all with 10-12 people, working together for years.
Sometimes for 2-three months of file.
And in that leg, you realized that the important thing is the respect that you have for them, when you determined a task that you can't explain that you can't get any other.
When you go back and explain: "We had to do this, and the optic, and the attention, and the attention, and the whole thing -- and that all the technology, and the spreading aspects of humans when you work in the pattern, you can be explained. It's the thing that maybe they have lived something together.
Let's respective of respect.
When I came back to my next movie to do my next movie and I tried to apply the same principle of leadership to respect the same principle of leadership and to make their respect.
It's really changed the dynamic.
And so here I still have once with a small group, in inexplored inexplored to do "Avade" with new technologies that didn't exist.
By emotion.
Tremendously.
And we have become a family, in four and a half and a half.
And it changed my way to do movie.
People have commented that I got the organisms from the ocean and I put them on the planet Pandora.
For me, it was the way to do business to do business -- the process that was changed.
What can we do about this?
What are the lessons we lear?
I think the first is curiosity.
It's the most powerful thing we can do.
The imagination is a force that can actually manifest a reality.
And the respect of the group is more important than all the things in the world.
Young regists are regists to me and they say, "I give me some advice to do this."
And I say, "Don't poneted limits.
Other people are going to do it for you, not to do yourself against yourself.
And you get risk."
At NASA tells is always this sentence, "The error's not contemplato."
But the error has to be an option in the art and exploration, because it's like a vacuum.
And no important evidence that requid innovation has been done without risks.
You have to be disposed to run these risks.
This is the thought that I want to leave you, which is that I want to leave you, it's an option, but the fear is a option, but the fear now. Thank you.
If I wanted to do you to figure a great idea would be that the set of the data that we consume is bigger than the sum of his parts, and that instead of the information, I would like to use information to use information to make new relationships.
Here you see the typically statistics of organized death.
This instrument that I use is a small experiment.
It's called Pivot, and with Pivott I can choose to choose a death, we say, the accidents.
And we see emerging new relationships.
The reason is that in the central part of the central people are more and here is more fragile.
We can do a step back and reorganize the data for cause, we see that data disease, we see that circulators and cancer are the greatest individual disease, but not all of all.
If we look at the age and we film for eth, we see 40s, we see that accidents are the causes of death.
Since it closer to the men of men.
So you've got to realize information and data in these way is a little bit like swimming graphic information.
And if we can do it with given data because they don't do it with the contents?
For examples here we have the cover of any Sports Illustrated every Sport.
All right.
You can get into your rooms and try to get you.
With Pivot can see a decade.
Or a year.
You can isolate a number in particular.
For example, we take the atletes that appear to this number, their sports.
I am a Lance Armstrong, so click here and I see all the numbers where to appear Lance Armstrong.
Now, if I want to give us a look at this, I could think "Why don't look at all the cycle cycle cycle cycles.
I do a step back.
And I see Greg Lemond.
You know, you'll have realized that when you navigbetween the information in this way from the closer or longer is not just a research, it's not just a research, it's not the browser.
But you do something slightly different.
It's a half of the middle that we're going to change how we can use information.
We still deep this idea that can seem a little bit of crazy.
We took every single page of Wikipedia and we reduced it to a short that consists in a small synosses and an icons that indicate.
I'm just going to show you the first 500 between Wikipedia.
Even in this screen, we can do a lot of it.
It turns out what tematic areas are the most visited to Wikipedia.
At this selection points.
And we see this option we see that the Wikipedia categories of Wikipedia, the Annow" of Time Magazine.
This is significant because it makes emerging something that in Wikipedia page.
And you see it just making a step back to see the together.
If I take one of these reasses on the category of the category of Time Magazine.
and see them.
At this point that most of government comes from the world's world from the world of science. A number of the world of business.
Here's my goat.
One comes from music.
And, which is quite interesting, Bone also won a TED.
So let's see all the winners of TED.
For the first time we're really navigating in network, as if it was a network, but at a high level.
I want to show you another thing.
This is the New York Times.
Pivot, this application -- I don't call it, because it's not a browser, because it's not a browser, but you need this technology for zoom -- we add this technology for zoom to zoom to the web, like this.
I can do a step back and get back to a specific section. This is important because the only see the Web pages so I'm going to see the web pages so I'm going to see all my navigation in the Internet same ighborhood.
I can zoom on what I did in specifics.
And in fact, you see the state of the end that I just presented.
I can in a sense of other things that I've seen in the day.
If I want to do a step back and see all I can do a pieces my historical historical historically,
Here I was trying to the newspaper, I was looking for the Bing Bing, here for Live Labs Pivot.
And from here I can zoom on my web page, and simply to refit from here.
A metaphor reused a lot of times, and in any case the result of the result of the parts.
Today, at the world, the data are views like a kind of maldition
It's about information.
It's about andom in the data.
And if we put everything under if we put the web under to get from something to the other, we get from one thing to the other, we used to go from a lot of other things for a lot of other thing, then we can see those structures that otherwise to see the structure that otherwise would be able to see those structure?
And then instead of feeling in the data we could really extract information.
Instead of working on information, we can pull out of knowledge.
And from knowledge, you can also get to the wisdom.
And with this thank you.
These are all talking about happiness.
I asked to count the number of books contents the word "happiness happiness and published in the last five years, they stopped after five years, and there were no longer.
There's an enormous ondata on happiness, in the researchers.
There is very coaching" to happiness.
Everybody would like to make people happy.
But nonetheless this flow of work, there's a series of cognition of cognitive traps that somehow to make the correct ideas of happiness.
My talk about today is going to be about this is going to be about these "cognitive cognitive traps.
And about both people think about their happiness, and they think about their happiness, and studying happiness that we are confuses like all the others.
The first of these traps is the luttancy to admit the complexity.
It turns out that the word happiness is no longer a word useful word about camps.
And I think it can restring to a particular meaning particularly but in the massic line line, we have to deal with this accuration and we're going to have the most complicated vision of what the well-being."
The second traps is the confusion between experience and memory: in practice to choose between being happy in life, and happy to be happy to their life.
And these are two extremely different concepts of happiness.
And the third is the illusion of host focus, so unfortunate that we can't think about any circumstances that influid the importance.
I mean, it's a true trap.
and there's no way to do the right thing.
I would like to start with an example of a person who, after a session of questions and answers, after a lesson, telling a story.
It's not clear -- the Disse that while it would listen to a symphony of the recording of the recording of the recording of the recording.
And then add a very experience, that he brought the whole experience.
But it wasn't true.
What was the reminded was the remind of experience.
He had lived the experience.
And he had listened for 20 minutes of the wonderful music.
but that he didn't remained because he was remained with a certain remind, and the remind was all that remained and remind was everything that remains.
What this episode us says, in the bottom is that we could think about ourselves and other people in terms of two "s."
There is a set that lives of experiences, who lives in the present and knows the present, and it's able to live the past, but basically, it has only the present.
This is what the experiences the experiences and what the doctor is close to -- you know when the doctor -- you know when the doctor docts.
And then you have the set that you remember, and it is that you remember the points of our life, and the concern of the history of our life, and this is that the doctor is that the doctor is that the doctor, "How are you feel neighborhood?"
or something similar to Albania?" or something like that.
These are two different entities, the until you live an experience and what if I remember, and confound the two is part of the happiness confusion of happiness.
Which is remember, it's a cantastories.
And this process beginning with a fundamental answer of our reminds -- start immediately.
We don't tell stories only when we decided to tell them.
Our memory tells us about our experiences of our experiences is a story.
Let me start with an example.
It's about a old study.
That brings the experiences of two patients during a pain.
I'm not going to be in the details. It's not even painful to the day of today, but it was given in the 1990s.
He asked the patients of reporting their pain every 60 seconds.
And here's the results for two patients.
These are their results.
If you ask you" Chos ask you?"
It's a very simple question.
Of course, the Patient Britain.
his colon-found dropped over and for every minute of the patient soffered by the patient BBs has suffered at least as or more.
But now there's another question, "How do these patients think we have suffered to have suffert?"
and here's the surpris: Ose, the Patients had a remind of the degree of the Patient B.
The stories of the colons were different given given that a part of this particularly delicate procedure is the way that -- no one of these stories is particularly positive -- but one of the two is different -- one of the two is that one of the other.
And the worst is the worst of the pain was the final moment.
It's a negative story.
How do I know?
Why we asked to these people after the colond, and also at the distance of time, and also at the distance of time, all the experience, everythings?"
And it turned out to be the worst for B, for B, in remind.
So this is a conflict between the sand that lives the experiences and the experiences and the spread.
From the point of view that lives the experience, is clearly going to be suffering.
So, what you could do for the A, and we effectured experiments -- and we actually had clinical experiments, and it really works, you could extend the colons of the Patient A, keeping the tube.
This is going to be a little bit of pain the patient, but just a little bit less than before.
And making this for a couple minutes, the site that lives the experience of the Patient is going to be a lot better, and the set of the country, because now the Pcompanies has a better than his experience.
How do you call a story?
And this is to the stories that are from the reminds that for the stories that we invent. What makes a story, are the changes a story, are the changing moments and final.
The finals are very, very important -- in this case, the final has dominated.
So, the sands that lives the experiences of his life in the continue.
Which moments when you live experiences that are following to question: what happens to these moment?
And the answer is simple.
They're lost to say that most moments of our life -- to like I calculated them -- to like I calculated them -- I mean to be psychological psychological psychologists that means that in one month if they count about 6,000, if they count about 6,000.
Most are completely ignored by the sand that remember.
And yet, in some way you have the sense that they should count, what happens in these moments of experience is our life.
They're the limited resources that we're spending in this world.
And how to spend it, it seemed to be relevant, but this is not the story that the site that reminds to us.
So we have a site that reminds and a site that lives experiences that are pretty different.
The largest difference between two is how to treat the time.
From the point of view, if you go to the experience, if you go to the vacation and the second week is funny as much much as the earlier, then the vacation of a week of a week of a week.
But this is not absolutely the way in which the sand it works that I remember.
For the site that I remember, a vacation of two weeks is a bests of a week of vacation because there are no new reminminds in addition it.
You didn't change the story.
And in this way, the time is the variable critics that distinguises the sand lives the experiences.
The time has a limited impact on this story.
Well, the site that reminds is that reminds more than to remember and tell stories.
It's actually the until decisions that makes decision, if we consider a patient that has had, for example, two different physicians and it's deciding what the two choices is what the two chooses is what the doctor, and what's going to be the medical choice.
The sands that lives the experiences has no voice in these choices.
In fact, we don't choose between experience, but between the reminds of those experiences.
And even when we think about our future, we don't think of our future, we don't think of our future.
We think about our future as a memories.
Basically, you can consider this situation, like a tyrannia that remember, and you can think of the situation, and you can think of the situation that lives the experiences that lives the experiences of the experiences of what the experience, has no need.
I have a feeling that when we go to the vacation is often the case that you go to the service of the service of our site that I remember.
And this is a little difficult to justify.
But what do we consume our memories?
This is one of the explanations that is given for the predominum of the site is that remember.
When I think about that, I'm in mind a vacation in the Antarcts, which is one of the best vacation of my life, and how I think relatively spect to other vacation.
And I probably spent to think about the reminds of that journey of three weeks, to say, 25 minutes in the last four years.
If I had ever opened the 600 pictures of the journey, I would spent another hour. It's about three weeks of travels of travels of journey that translate in the massix.
Well, I could be a little extremely extreme, in my shot appeared for the consumption, but even if you do more than that, a genuine question.
Why do we fish to respect to the fish that we are the experience?
I want you to think about an experiment with thought.
Imagine that during the next next vacations, you know that at the end of the vacation all the photographs, and that you're going to get a medicine, and you take a medicine for the amness, and you don't remember.
Do you choose the same vacation? And if you could choose a different, you create a conflict, you create a conflict, and you have to think about how you solving a conflict, and you have to think about how if you think in terms of time.
And if you think in terms, you could get another answer.
Because we choose the vacation that we do is a problem that we do is a problem that you have to choice.
The two notes of happiness.
There are actually two concepts of happiness concepts that we can us, one for each of them.
So you can ask is: How happy is the experience?
And then you can ask is: How happy are the moments in the life of the experience?
And it's about -- happiness for moments is a complicated process.
What are the emotions that can measure?
And, whatever we are able to do a pretty good sense of the happiness of the spreading experiences in time.
If you ask the happiness of the sand is that remember, it's completely different.
It's not about how happy a person.
It's about what it is the person who is the person when you think about his life.
It's a very different.
Everyone is able to distinguish these two notions is not going to make confusion in the studies of happiness of happiness to a group of students of happiness to a group of happiness for a long period of happiness for a long period of exactly in this manier.
The difference between happiness is that lives the experiences and the satisfaction of the satisfaction of the satives that has been recognizes to measure the two separately, the institute of the two separatels where more than half million people have been subjecting in the midd-million people have been undersive, and their experience.
And there have been other studies in this direction.
So in the last years, we started to learning about happiness of two knows.
And the biggest lesson that we learned is that they're very different.
You might know how a person is satisfied with its life, and still this doesn't tell you very much about how happy they are living their life, and neighborhood.
To give you an idea of the correlation is about 0.5.
What if you mean that if you meet somebody, and he says, "Oh, his father is 1.8, how would you know what about his height?
Well, you know, something about its high, but with a lot of uncertainty.
You would always have a little bit of uncertainty.
If I tell you that somebody thinks that his life is at eight in a decade of a decade in a decade to be very involved about how happy the experience.
So the correlation is low.
We have a certain knowledge of what control is happy.
We know the money is very important, the goal is very important.
We know to be happy means to be satisfied with people who like us, to spend the time with people who like us.
These are other pleasers, but these are the principles.
So if you want to masximize the happiness of two knows, you're very different things.
The conclusion of what I said is that we shouldn't be to think about happiness as a sustain.
It's about two different ideas.
Again, very quickly, another reason we can't think we can't think about happiness to the happiness is that we're not preactent to the same things when we think about life, and when we live life.
So, if you simple the questions about how happy happy people in California, you can't get the correct answer.
When you ask this question, you think you should be happier in California, which in Ohio.
What happens is that when you think about life in California, you're thinking about the contrast of California and other places, and other places, and example that confront is the climate.
Well, it turns out that climate is not important for the sand it is that lives the experiences and it's not very important for the site that is the reflect that is what happy decides that is what happy.
But because the sand that reflects is in charge, you could end up -- some of the people could get to California.
And it's interesting to be interesting what will happen to people who get into California in hope of being happy.
Well, the site that lives the experiences will not be more happy.
We know it.
But it's going to happen. They're going to think about being happy, because when they think they will remember, they will remember the time in Ohio.
And they will think we have taken the right decision.
It's very difficult to think about well-being and I believe you've given the idea of how much hard to think about it.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: Thank you. I have a question.
Thank you very much.
When we were to the phone a couple of weeks ago, he mentioned me that a interesting result that is resulted by the Gallup.
It's something that thinks we can share that we still have a few minutes?
Daniel Kahneman: Yeah.
I think the most interesting result that we found in the Gallup is a number, which we didn't expected to find.
We found that with the happiness to happiness, that lives the experiences.
When we looked at how the various feelings with the reds, we discovered that, at the underneath of 60,000 dollars a year, for the Americans to a year, for the American camp, on a very sample of 60,000 American camp. It's about 60,000 American camp.
CA: 60,000 dollars a year, 60,000 dollars a year, people are infects, and they become progressively further than the pover, and they become more than that, we find a ran line.
I saw the line of the lines.
Of course, what happens is that the money is not buying happiness of experience, but the lack of the experience, and we can measure that misery.
In terms of the other sand, is that I remember, it's all another story.
The money of adgans, more content.
This is not recording on emotions.
CA: But Danny, all the effort of Americans about life, the research of happiness.
If people take seriously on this discover, basically falls all the way we created everything that we believe, for example, politics and so forth.
There is the chance that politicians, and the nation in general, can take a discovery like that seriously and bring a discovery based on being?
DK: You know that I think is to recognize the role of happiness in public politics.
The pressure is going to be slow in the United States is not doubt, but in the U.K., is becoming reality, and in other states.
People are beginning to recognize happiness when they think about public politics.
It's going to be a little bit, and people are going to talk to if they want to study the experience of happiness or whether they want to study the valuable of the life that we need to start this debate debate.
Like happiness direction, takes different directions of how you you think about the sets that you think is that it makes the experience.
This is going to influence, I think, in the years that will true.
In the United States, are making efforts to measure the experience of the population.
And that, I think, it will enter the next few decade, perhaps two of the national statistics.
CA: Well, it seems to me that this argue will be, or the less should be, the discussion of politics to following in the next years.
Thank you very much.
Thanks Danny Kahneman.
I'm going to talk about energy and climate.
It can seem strange, because in my work at the foundation of worries and seeds, things to invent and giving the world to help two billion people to help the two billion people live to live lives better.
But the climate and energy, they're very important to this people, are very important for this people, are more important to the world.
A worst climate significant, for many years, loss of collects.
It's going to be too rain, or too poet.
The things are going to change that their fragile environment.
which leads to the families. As conflict.
So, climates, they are going to be terrible for them to terrible them.
Even the cost of the energy is important.
In fact, if you could get the price of one thing, to reduce the poverty, you choose long.
The price of the energy price.
And a civilization progress to the progress in energy field.
The carbon revolution of the carbon that industrial revolution.
And in the 20th century we have been assisted to a rapid decline in the electricity, which explains why we have the frigerators, we can create modern materials, we can create modern materials.
And in the rich world is about the electricity in a excellent situation.
But while the price, for example, we have to respect a new window of CO2 emissions of CO2.
The CO2 is warming the planet, and his equation is very simple.
The CO2 embecauses a temperature, which induces very negative effects.
Effects on the climate and perhaps worst effects in the sense that natural ecosystems are not going to adeal with these rapids.
The value of how it increases the temperature causes of CO2, and how each of the two things the other, is uncertainly, it's not very much.
And there's surely uncertainty about how negatives will be so much negative extremely negative.
And I often asked to the best scientists: we have to really reduce emissions almost to zer?
Don't we only reduce it or a quarter?
And the answer is that, until we get almost to zero, the temperature will continue to salie.
It's a great challenge, here.
It's not like, "Let's do we spend a 3.5 feet under 3.5 feet.
It's not about "to make it a little bit.
It's about to zero.
Now, let's get a lot of CO2 every year, over 26 billion tons.
About 20 tons for every American for every American
For the people of the poor countries is less than a tune tons of poor countries.
The world is about five tons of about five tons.
And in some ways, we have to do progress that would bring that amount to zero.
The emissions are constantly increased.
Only a few economic changes have changed this tendency, so we have to spend rapidling to zero.
This equation has four factors.
It's a series.
We have the amount on the left, CO2, which must have been down, and the factors on the right are population, the services that in the average every person use, the service and CO2 emaway from each person uses and CO2 emits.
We look at each other, and we see how we can do it.
Probaby, one of these numbers have to get to zero.
It's the high of high periors.
Let's see a little bit.
The first is population.
The world has 6.8 billion habiters.
We run to the nine billion.
If we do a good job with the new vaccines, health health reproductive health perhaps 10, 15 percent, but we record a increase of about 30 percent.
The second factor are the services.
Which understanding everything, the food that we eat, the TV, the TV, the TV, the TV,
They're desired, and free of poverty means to provide these services for almost everybody in the world.
And it's a positive thing that the number of increments.
In the wealthy world, we probably could save and use men, but in the average of the middle world.
And so, complex, the amount of services are going to be more than dop.
This is a very simple example of service.
You have the illumination in your house, to do the compites, but these kids are doing, so they experience.
How much about efficiency -- E, energy for the universe -- here finally there are good news.
This is not increasing.
Thanks to a lot of inventions, new ways of illumind, automobiles, building differently, building differently, for many services can deminate the energy consumed energy.
In some services you can reduce 90 percent.
There are other services like fertilizes, like fertilizes, or the best airplane, where the best brings are very, very inferior.
So, complex in the best case, the energy consumed will reduce from three to maybe six times.
But these first three billion factors reduce emissions from 26 and the best 13 billion tons.
It's not enough.
Let's look at the quarter factor, the key factor, the amount of energy.
The question is, can we reduce it to zer?
If you burke, no.
If you burn green.
Almost all of the ways to produce today to produce electricity, and the nuclear CO2.
So what we're going to have to do on global scale -- it's creating a new system.
And we need miracle "ener" --
The miracle "miraculous, I don't mean something impossible.
The microprocessor is a miracle. The person is a miracle.
Internet, and his services, are a miracle.
People today have participated to the creation of a lot of miraces.
We usually don't have a decadence, a data enter to connect the miracle.
Of course is to the window and something else no.
And in this case, we have to drive to the whole speed, and make a miracle in very remarkable times.
I ask, how to illustrate this concept?
How is a natural examples that captures the imagination of people?
I rethought about a year ago, when I brought to the mosquence, and people found it.
The fact that participes of the fact that in the world, there are people who live with the mosquence.
This is my idea for energy.
I decided to do the light of light would be this year my contributed with the environment.
Here's lighules.
They tell me that I'm not going to be able to get out of the boat.
now, we can invent us like this, but it's not going to be help.
We need a solutions, one or a lot that they are going to work on great scale and very climbs, and although they are exploring in many directions, I think that only five will be able in many directions.
I excludes the games, the nuclear fusion, the nuclear fires.
They could also give some contribute, and if they can do more than I would expect, but here I am interested in terms that we're going to have to work on each of these five of these five, and not give anyone of these fies hard challenges.
We look for the first combustion of fossil combustible fuels or natural gas.
Here our job seems to be simple, but it's not to capture CO2, after the CO2, after the combustion, pressurect it from the field, resummption, and hopefully, and hopefully, and hopefully.
Today there are experimental technologies that captured 60 percent of CO2 percent of CO2, but reaching 100 percent is going to be very complicated and will be difficult and it's going to be very difficult to be very complicated.
The best issue is the longer than the long.
Who will flow?
Who is going to run something that is literally billion times more voluminous than any other type of all kinds of us, like nuclear or another?
It's a huge volue.
So it's a difficult.
Another would be the nuclear.
But also the nuclear presents three big problems.
The cost, especially in a very ruling countries is high.
The issue of safety, the feeling that nothing can go wrong history that can go wrong, and that the combustible fuel.
And how to deal with the score?
Malgrade of the redocts, the concerns are so much.
People need to be massive.
Three very difficult problems, which you could solve it, and on what you should work.
The last three of the five sources.
These are what people often defines "rinnovable."
And to say the very, very large advantage of not to require a combustible combust.
The first is that the energy density of energy produced with these technologies is decided to the electric.
It's about to collect energy," and so many kilometers of a kilometers, of thousands of times more extens of a normal electric.
And these functions are intermitts.
The sun is not beautiful all day, and newspapers all the newspapers.
So if you depends on these sources, you have to find a way of grass, you have to find electrical energy.
The red challenges took us on the front of the costs.
And on the distribution.
For example, let's say that the energy source.
So not just you need the technology, but you also have to do the connects of the risks of the outside.
And finally, the problem of accustomer.
By to estimate the size of the problem, I got all kinds of bacteriums realized today, today, today, I compared them with the amount of energy electrical energy of electrical electrical energy used in the world and I discovered that all of the bacteria.
So we really need a big step of a big step of 100 times respect to the approaches right now.
which is not impossible, but it's not very simple.
This problem is already when the "intermitt" produce more del, 20 or 30 percent of the energy.
If you go to the sources for 100 percent, you need a battery battery.
But how are we going to get on this street? What is the right approaching?
Is a Manhattan? What could solve the problem? What could solve the problem?
Most companies, hundred have to put it to work.
We need at least hundred people in each of these five sectors.
Many of them, you look at them, you would call them.
And I think here, in the group of TED, many people are already working in these fields.
Bill Gross have different companies, where a called eSolar Solar that vanta large technologies.
Sinod Khosla is investing in dozens of companies that are making great things and have interesting potentialities, and I'm giving the support to this.
Nathan Myhrvold and I are financiating a company which, following the street.
There are some innovations in the bottom of modular, the nuclear nuclear liquid.
But from a little bit of time, the sector, the sector, that there are some good ideas around is not so surprising.
The idea of Terran is that, instead of burns in the U23 percent of the uranum available, we decided to burn the U238, 999 percent of the U238, 99999 percent of a crazy idea in a certain sense.
For the truth of the truth, but it never been adequately, but it would work, because of the supercomputer modern supercomputer modern today, you can make a simulation and see that yes, with the right materials, it seems to work.
And as you burn the 99 percent of the uranium of urania, the cost of the best expensive.
They burn the scories, and they use the reactors of the reactors of today, that the reactors of today, that they would become together.
It's consumed the urane combustions. It's a kind of candler.
It's like a wood-burns that burns is called reactor to progressive.
From view of combustible the problem is solved.
Here's a picture of a place in Kentucky.
This is the scary, 999 percent of the uranium that has been taken the top part of the us, and so it's called uran impover.
These "down" are energy to the United States for century.
And by the sea water, with a economic process, and there would be enough combustible for the rest of this planet.
Most challenges us, but this is an example of hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of ideas that we need to progress.
How should we measure our progress?
What should they have to contain the pays?
I love the goal, and then we value, and then we value.
You have heard a lot of people talking about a reduction of 80 percent for the 2050, it's very important to be able to do it.
20 percent is going to be produced by the poor countries, and from a bit of agriculture.
At that point, we will solved the deforesting and the production of the cement.
So to get 80 percent, the developed countries, including countries like China, they'll have been completely replaced their electrical production.
The other question is, are we making this technology to zer?
We put it in practical countries?
Can we have spreading this?
It's a very important.
It's a key element.
Againing about the fact that should have the pay of the 20?
And that should have the same two aspects.
We should implement of efficiency to start getting the reductions.
We're going to be the total amount of CO2, and so the temperature.
But the vote in this matter, making things that don't behavior, is just a heavy weighborhood, which is the speed of the innovation that is the speed of the innovation of the new inventions.
We have to push these progress, and we can measure the speed, and we can measure the speed from the number of companies, projects.
A lot of good books have been written about it.
The Al Gore, "The choice," and the David McKay, "Sustable Energy Without the Hot Airain."
These books approximate the problem and create a context in which to be debate because these things need to have a spread sustain.
Many things have to be contemporary to them.
So I have a wish wish,
A very concret that we're going to invent technology.
If I had to choose a wish for the next 50 years, training the president of the country, the realization of a vaccine, whose holding a vaccine, you can do this thing the half and not produce CO2, I would have to choose this final thing.
It would be that with biggest impact.
If this wish is not going to realize the short of the short and the long, between the United States and China, between the United States and China, in the life of those two billion of people are going to be long.
What do we do?
What am I'm inviting to take the initiative and proceding?
It's necessary more research.
When the countries come to places like Copenhagen, they shouldn't talk just about CO2.
They should be discussing the program, and stupid you'd have to be a little bit of innovations.
We need incentives, the incentive, the cap and trade," the tools that evidly evidence the cost of pollution.
We have to spread the message.
We have to make this most rational dialogue and understanding the choices of the government.
It's a impegnative, but I believable.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: Thank you.
Thanks. Just to know more about Terran than Terran --
first of all, you can give us an idea of the size of investment?
Bill Gates: Realizing software to water the supercomputer, assumming all the great scientists, what we already have done demands of millions, and even when we have tested the materials in a reatter reactor, to make sure that work, we're going to talk about hundreds of millions.
And the difficult thing is to build the reactor spread various billion authorities, the place where it will be built the first example.
Once you built the first one, if it works as an announced -- because the costs of Colombo, because the costs of energy, are completely different from nuclear nuclear that we know today.
CA: So, if I understand well, this implement the building, below loud, a vertical nuclear service, of this kind of uranible uranum of nuclear, of this kind of poverty.
Can the process begins and progres?
BG: Right. The reactors, today, are continually rereformed a lot of people, lots of controls that cannot work, opening and exactly --
It's not good.
If the combustible is very cheap, and you can do it over 60 years -- you can do it and forgot all these complexity.
It burn there, burn for search -- and then finished.
CA: A nuclear implants that makes itself.
BG: Yeah. Well, the rejects can get them into another reactor and burn them into another reactor and burn them.
And we're going to start with the reject already existence, now conserved in the vadows or near the reactors.
They're going to be our first fuel.
So what was a problem of reactors is going to be the fueling of the nostris, and the volume is going to be reduced in a impressive way.
CA: But when you talk to the world of the potential of this technology, where most of this technology?
BG: Well, there is no place in particular, and there are all these interesting rules of transparency about what is defined nuclear that we get very interest.
Our staff has been in Russia, China.
I just met the Segretary for Energia.
We talked about how this idea you get to the current program.
They're optimist. France and Japanese have made of work in this field.
It's a variation on something that has been done.
It's about a substantial improvement, but it's a reactor of speed, which many countries have already built a reactor has already built a reactor.
CA: How do you know, what are the times and the probability that something of the kind of making the kind of things?
BG: Well, for one of these projects to scale that produces energy, which makes energy, which is not much about 20 years to design.
This is the scadence that the environmental modemonstrate to be tox.
Terrapower, if all process, whether it's not going to be able to ask this objective.
And now, fortunately, dozens of companies in the sector, which analogly, if their research works, if the fundaments for their pilots, they are going to be took today, they can compete.
And it's better if a lot of solutions are going to have succeed, because at that point is going to remember,
It's necessary that at least a success.
CA: Parling of important, revolutionary, this is the biggest you know?
BG: A revolution is the most important.
It would be without the environments, but the environmental environmental to make much more important.
In the fact of nuclear is other innovators.
We don't know their work as well like this, but one is the nuclear modular is a different approach.
There's a liquid reactor of realize, but maybe they tell them what we do.
There's different, but the beautiful, the beat is that a molecules of uranium -- a million times more energy than a molecule of a molecule of a molecule of a molecule, in terms of the negative effects on the environment, in terms of the effects on the environment.
CA: And if not work, what do we do?
Don't we should start to adopt measures to try to keep the temperature temperature of stabile?
BG: If you find in that situation, is a little bit like when you eat, and you're going to have a cardiac attack.
Where do you go to that point? Can you need a surgeon or something like that.
There's a whole research line of geo-engineering, which is a various techniques that would slow downing 20 or 30 years in which coordinate 20 or 30 years in which coordinate 20 or 30 years in which coordinate the action.
It's like to like an insure polyny.
You hope you don't need it.
Some people say that they wouldn't be working to the polize, because you could employee to continue to keep eat because so much the surgeons.
I don't think it's a choice, view the importance of the problem, but now in the environment of geo-engineering, if you need to keep the solutions of the solutions in the case that the previst.
CA: If I had a phrase, if I had a phrase or two to the sentence, like you could persuade them that have to come back?
BG: Well, unfortunately, there are different types and the ones who have scientific arguments are very well.
Some people say that there's a negative feedback to the clouds of the clouds of the climbing.
They're very, very few of the things that can only say that there is a probability on a million that you have to have the main probability to AIDS.
You put a mistake a hour, and you pay the consequences.
And so, when you're pressed by thousands and emergence, the idea of making sacrifices that you see the results --
sacrifices for the sacrifices --
In fact, the relationship of the IPPC is not necessarily the worst case, there is people in the rich world that looks at IPPC and says, ok, okay, it's not a bad.
The fact is that uncertainty should push.
But my dream is that if we can realize it economically, and to respect the windows on the CO2, then the check: OK, it's not myself CO2, almost prefer if you don't have CO2, almost previous technologies.
CA: It would be this your answer to the Bjorn Lomborg, that if you invest all of your energies and trying to solve the CO2, your other energy, your other goals, you'll be sacrificed, and that put money, and that put money, when are better things to do it, means to do that, when are there better things to do it?
BG: Well, the exhibition and developed --
We say that the U.S, they should spend 10 billion in more than they do now it's not that enough.
It should not distract resources to other discops.
The things that are very money, and they are reasonable to people, are the funding of anti-economic solutions.
For me is absolutely that I know.
But unless you are not financing the curved curve, close to the point where it's going to become a very cheap, I think the efforts are concentrated in technologies that have the potential of environment.
If the alternative was, "Let's make the expensive energy, so that only the rich can allow it allows them to allow the energy.
The disaster would be for those two billions.
And Lomborg has reseen his positions.
His now, "Why does it isn't discussing more than Resears and Svilups?"
For his past yet, you still realized that it's a pretty much realized that it's a pretty group of the Research.
And it's a question that I think is appropriate to be appropriate.
It's amazing as a research and development.
CA: Well, Bill, I guess to talk about the audience of the audiences of the audience that I hope to see your desire to be reality. Thank you.
BG: Thank you.
I'd like to share with you a discovery that I did some month ago as I was writing a Wireview.
I always have my dictionaries of synonymous hand every time I write something, but I had already finished that I never had in my life, and I realized that word "disabe" to see what I would found out.
Let me read the result.
"Disible," hoddamages -- damaged, unuseful, broke, broken out, you know, rocketed viewed, purchase, impotenty, consumption, consumed by the middle of the circulation, Senile, Senile, Senile, sweat, stoddled out of the circulation, sweet, stopped out of the debe.
Contrari: In shape, able.
I was reading this list to a friend and the beginning to a friend and the word was so ridiculous, it was so ridiculous, but I had to stop my voice down, and I had to stopped me to stopping from the shock and the impact of these words left.
You know, we're talking about.
I think I'm going to be a old building, right.
But, in fact, the data of the first 1980s.
And when I was starting schools, and I was forming and learning what was going to existed out of my family and relative things to the other kids, and the world around me.
and until useful because of God was not using the dictionary.
I mean, by this explanation seems that are born in a world that he sees somebody like me who has no longer positive in any way for them, and they are made today, they are celebrated for opportunities and the adventure that my life has processed.
So, I am immediately went to see the building 2009 in the network, waiting to find a revision without value.
This is the amazing version of description.
Unfortunately, it's not much better.
I find the last two words under "almost particularly uncomfortable, "inter" and the health" -- it's not just about the words.
It's what we think of people when we nominate them with these words.
It's about the values behind these words, and how we build these words.
Our influence, our thinking and our view of the world and how we see the other people.
In fact, many civilizations, including that Greek and that Romana, believed that they would off, because they say the high voice was more powerful, because it saying things to existence.
So, what do we want to bring to exist, a person that is limited, or a person with greater force?
So, basically doing something that simple as to nominate a person, a child, we could could put them on their force.
Don't we want to open for them?
One person like this, that opened me to the doctor of the doctor of the kidney Allistitute Delaware in Wilmington, Delaware.
his name is Dr. Pize.
HaloAmerican whose nne, whose nne, he was too difficult to practice for most Americans, so it became doctor P.
And the doctor's weared fpillon colored and had a perfect perfect for working with children.
I had basically anything about the time that I spent in hospital, with the exception of physians of physian-therapia.
I had to do what seemed to be infinished to exercise with these large large faselastic colors, you know, to help me build the muscles of legs.
And I hate these more than anything.
I hate them, I got them sick.
And, you know, I knew already, like a five years, with the Dottor to try to get away from these exercis' exercise to exercis;
And, one day, he came to one of my sites sitting and unexorable, these seats.
And he said, "wow, Aimee, you're a very strong, I think you go to break one of those fas.
"When the rop, I'm going to give you 100 dollars."
Now, clearly was just a small manage of the docor to do the exerciss that I didn't want to do the perspective of being the rich of the second plane of the second plane, what has been to done in a different shape of a different shape of a different shape.
and turn it into an interesting experience for me.
And I ask myself today, the entity of his vision, and his declared to myself as a child, he redefined my vision of myself in a luck, and atletics to the future.
This is an example of how adults with positions of power can put the force of a child.
But in example of the first with the definitions of the vocabolary of the synons, our language is not going to be able to evolve towards the reality that we all want, the possibilities.
Our language, it's not been created with changes of our society, many of which have been created by technology.
And of course, from a point of media view of middle operations to the lasers for view, and they can be environable for aging bodies that are helping people who are helping people to cooperate with their skills and move to cooperate with their skills that nature has imposed to people to be able to drive the social network, they allowed to people.
So, maybe technology is going to revealing us now more than always been a truth, which has always been a truth, which has something rare and podered to our society, and the human ability to our society, and the human ability to adapt is our biggest quality.
The human human ability to adapt, is something interesting, because people always wanted to talk to me about a difficult and I have to admit and I have to admit you.
This phrase never good, and I always felt good, and I always heard to the answer people to this is going to be beginning to understand why.
It's under this phrase, insurmoney in this phrase, is the idea that success, or happiness, or happiness, or happiness, or the happiness of this experience, if my success in life, if my success in life came from a schiving or circummnavigate the present of a life with the protext of a life with the protexs of a life with the protess, or whatever people like my disability.
But in fact, we have changed, logically, by a challenge, by a challenge, physically or bottom.
And I would be suggesting that it's a good thing.
The adversity is not a obstacle obstacle that we have to add our life.
it's part of our life.
And I tend to think that it's like my shomb.
Sometimes I noticed a lot of nothing, but it's always with me.
And, of course, not trying to decrease the impact, the fish of a person.
There are the adversities and challenges in life, and it's all real relative to every single person, but the question is not if you have the adversities of opposed to deal with it.
So, our responsibilities is not simply to protect people to us, but preparing them to realize them in the right way.
And let's do a damage to our children when we make them feel that they're not going to address.
There's an important difference and distinction between the fact of the fact of being a printed and the subjective opinion the subject of society that sees me or not.
And, in verity, consistent consistent that I had to addresing is whether the world has ever thought I could be described by those words.
In our wish to protect those that we love giving us a cold damage, during truth, really, really, the product of their life expectancy of their life, we have to be safe to not put the first morning in a wall that you disabilities.
Maybe the existing model of looking at what there is a rock and how to put it to the place, it can indebulating the subject that the disease.
In the complete, not to do a person in the complete, it doesn't do to understand his potentialy, and we are creating another disease, that they have.
We're actually giving a value of a person in our community.
So we have to see through the disease and the elence.
And much more important, there's a relationship between those insufficiences and our great creativity.
So, it's not at the proposition, or negar, these research as something that we want to avoid or discocool behavior, but rather to find those opportunities in a accident.
So, maybe the idea that I want to explain is that there is no thing like to explain, as it goes us to have a term of liber, to use a term of liber, to use a term of free liber, perhaps we dancing together.
And, perhaps we look at an accident as natural thing, and we're less surrowed by his presence.
This year to celebrate the complex of Charles Darwin, and it was 150 years ago, when I writing about evolution, which Darwin illustrated, the truth, the truth, the truth, the truth.
To tell you in another way, it's not the stronger of the expect that survive, and it's not even the smarter that most adapts to the changes.
The conflict is the genese.
From of Darwin, in the other things, we can recognize that human ability to survive and developed is driven by the suffering.
So, again, transformation, it's our biggest quality.
And, perhaps we are not myself to try and what we are made of.
Maybe this is what gives us the adversity, a sense of that is a sense of their force.
So, we can do a gift.
We can seeing the adversity as something more than difficult.
Maybe we can see it as a change.
The adversity is a change that we don't even adaptop.
I think the biggest we created is this idea of normal we created is this idea of normality. Now, who is normal you know?
There is no normal, there is a common typical typical.
And you want to meet those poor people to exist?
I don't believe it.
If we change this paradigm from one to how to get the normal normality to one on the possibility, or potentialy, to be arightly more dangerous than many children, and to invite them to unique, and inviting them to unique, and invite them to unique, and inviting them to community.
The anthropologists us that what I us, as humans, we always wanted for the members of our community is help, to contribe.
There is an evidence that in Olanda, 60 years ago, they brought the old and the dream and the subjects, and the subjects with gravs, and the experience of the experience of these people was the evidence of the community: they wouldn't see this people like roten or use; they wouldn't do people like it.
A few years ago, I was in a city market in the city where I grew grew up in the northern Pennsylvania.
and I was employees in front of a dory cest.
It was summmer, and I had a short of the shorts.
I heard this guy, his voice behind me tells behind me -- but it's not Aimee Mullins." And I flew me and there's this guys.
And I said, "Don't you remember? I don't remember? I don't remember, I remember, you don't remember having a meet, you don't remember.
I mean, when we were met I was getting hidden from your mother."
Oh, that guy.
And, but of course, he was played a band.
That gentleman was Dr. Kean, a man that I had only known by the stories of my mother on that day, because, clearly, they came into two weeks of two weeks.
And so, the ecologist of my mother had gone to the vacation of my mother had gone to me was a complete extract for my parents.
And, because I'm born without lost the lot, and I had the folks in this feet, some of the fingers, and some in that he's had to be the messagger; this summer, this sumest.
She said, "I had to give this progrists to your parents that you would never walk, and you would never walk, and you would never have had the kind of mobilities that have given me of my children or no kind of independent life, and you've given me of the bugate thing that has told me that he told me that he told me that he told me that he's going to be done articouple of the childhood that I had vinced my school, a concording all of my school, a but,
that I had brought with the Girl Scout, you know, the Halloween, who I had my study won my studio, or all of the sports of the sports of the sports of Hallotories of Hershey, teaching the students of Hershey, and Hershey.
And he called this part of the bottom of the X, the potentiality.
No prognoses can keep in the connection of how much point can be and how determining in the quality of a person.
And the doctor Kean continued to explain, and he said, "In my experience, unless not to the repeated, and even though the repeated, and even though he's given a baby."
You see, the Dr. Kean has changed his opinion.
He realized that there's a difference between a medical condition and what each can do with it.
And there was a changing change in thinking during the years, if you had 15 years old, if I had 15 years, if I had 15 years, if I had 15 years, and I wouldn't ext a second.
I had that kind of normality at that time.
If you ask me today, I'm not sure.
And it's because of the experiences that I had with them, not to the experiences that I had with them.
and maybe, the change in me is because I had been expoorest to people who have opened me to get the door of those who have obstacked.
You see, everything you need is a person that you need is a person that you have the epiphane of your potentialy, and you're part. If you can drive to somebody in their force, the spirit of their force, the spirit is so reaching someone in a crucial moment in a crucial moment, you're educating in the best ways.
You are teaching them to open the doors.
In fact, the exact of the word of educate is from the raot "extract exactly what it is, to get the potential.
So again, what's the potential that we want to get out.
There was a case of study in the 1960s Grand short in Grand short schools.
It's called the "evidence proof of it, we call it "allow" here in the unity" here in the United States.
It means to separate students dependently by their voters.
And the students with the best students have a more two, and better teachers have done it for a period of three months, Aron students with insufficient insufficient of the "optim." And they said they were very good -- that they were good --
And at the end of this period of three months, they were having a results at the level, clearly the sad of this study, and they took the results of students from the Otype from "Otmo" E, this is what happened to the end of the Otypically three months.
The ones that were in school, beyond to the ones that I had left.
The crucial part of this study was that also teachers were coming.
The teachers didn't know that was done this change.
It was telling them -- these are the optimic students and these are the ones with insufficient.
And that's how they started to teach them.
then, I think that disability is to have a damaged, and a spirit damaged and a spirit damage has no hope.
It doesn't see the beauty.
It has no longer our curiosity and our innate capacities of imagine.
if we can support the human spirit to keep the hope, to see the beauty in if you can see the beauty of themselves and curious curious and curious curious force we are using our force.
When the spirit has these quality, we can create new reality and new ways of essers.
I want to leave you with a poet poetry from a poet poetry that was 1300 called "Hafiz Jacques Dembodies.
And the poetry is called "The God that only know about four words." "The child has known God, not the NO, but the God who only knows the NO, but the God who only knows about four words and keeping and continues to dance with me" and keeps to dancing with me.
Thank you.
