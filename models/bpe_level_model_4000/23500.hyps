And I showed these slides to show that the slide of the article calculation -- which is almost three million years has had the size of 48 United States continents, you have the size of 48 percent.
However, this undervalue of the problem because it doesn't explain the ice of the ice problem --
The artic calotic calculation is, in a sense, the heart of the climate system.
You expands and you get out and you get out of the summer and expands.
The next slide will be a quick fast, the next 25 years.
The lost ice loads have red.
As you see, you know, they expand it up to the Europe
And that's the ice in the wint, which is reporting out of the summer of the summer in the summer of the summer in the summer of the summer in the summer of the summer in the summer of the summer in the summer of the summs.
You can see the cosident cosidential cosident in five years or more, which is like the blood that was from the body.
In 25 years is passed by this way.
This is a problem because the re-scale terrain around the ocean around the ocean and where there are huge amount of carbon congelated which, that monkeys are transformed to metane from microbes.
And I respect to the total inquination of global warming, that amount of warming, that amount of double, super-returing this point of not return.
In some deep deep in Alaska is already the metane is already rebolling from water.
The professoral Katey Walter of Alaska came up with a team that was a very low-pressed lrage that last inver.
Video: Wow! Al Gore: She is good. The question is if we will be all of us.
And one reason is that this termal scale Groenland from north.
This is a kind of record red.
The brought hadn't reached levels.
This is the Kangerlussuaq, in the Southern Groenlluse.
If you want to know how it is the sea level of the sea ice on earth th th thereâ€™s where the side.
These are going to be increasing very quickly.
Another part of the planet: Agweweather block of the planet.
The month of the scientists have diclear that the ice of ice is negative, and that the Western Antarctartide Western Western Western and underwater on some submarks on the sheep down.
And it is six feet of waters, like in Groenlland, as Groenlllland,
Sull'Himalaya, the third largest block, you see new laghi, and they see new laghi, who were ice to be ice in the laghi,
The world's population was going to be half of the pounds of the pounds of the monkey.
Sulle Ande: This ice is the bottom of the water water water water from this city.
The brought is increased.
But when it decreates water, the same acac is water.
In California nevada California is decreating 40-percent.
The hydrodrops.
And the previsions, as you have read,
The growing growth in the world leads to a nice of incens.
The environmental disasters are increasing a rhythm and without precedently precedently and without precedently precedently
Four most numbers sometimes in the last 30 years and respect to the precedent 75.
This is a whole bunch of all insustainable.
If you look at the historical context if you can see the consequences.
In the last five years we added 70 million tons of CO2 to 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the oceans every day.
Look at attently the area of the Americh, and in the Americh, towards the subcontinent on the subcontinent on the subcontinent of Indian subcontinent oxygen.
The largest cause, global warming, with deforestation, which is 20th the deforestation, which is the use of fossil fuels.
Ooil is a problem, and the carbon is even worse.
The United States are one of the two countries with more emissions, with China.
And he proposes to build a lot of carbon central other carbon cents.
But we're looking at a direction.
These are the projects of the last few years and some evidence of alternative evidence of greens.
And every way, there's a political lotta in our country.
The coal industry and oil industry has spent 250 million dollars in the last year, to promote carbon dioxymore.
That image me to something,
Very Natal, in Tennessee, where I live, there's been a 3.8 billion glass of carbon dioxide of carbon dioxide of carbon diox.
Maybe you saw it on the news of news news.
This is the second largest flow of exccle in America.
It happened around Nat.
The natalization of one of the carbon industry was this.
Video: It's a coal kind of cooookie is a kind of cooke.
It's abundant here in America, and it makes our economy.
Frosty the carbon is always more and more and more cleaner and more cleaner and more cleaner.
It's a good price, adorable and the workers are the sent of the reasons.
Al Gore: From here is a lot of coal West Virginia.
The largest society on the mountain Massey Coal. This is the Massey Coal.
Video: Don Blland, "Wone," "Look at Gore, Nancy Reid -- they don't know what they're talking about.
Al Gore: So the Alleance for the Clima Projection of Clima Clima has launched two campaigns.
This is a baby, a party.
Video: ALer: We can see the climate changes like a night-based on our business.
For this is to invest a big amount of money in a large amount of money in a switch to make public and consumption.
In fact, carbon is not sport.
We think it's cleaned -- it has a good profume.
So you didn't predict about climate change.
Let me do it.
Video: Attor: Cblean -- you heard a lot of it.
So let's do it a whole structure of the avanguard to the coal coal of carbon coal.
Straordinary! The machines are a little wheel.
The carbon consuming is between the main cause, global warming, but the remarkable technology of carbon and the clean that you can see it change.
To a check: This is the odierness,
Al Gore: Infine, the positive alternative positive to economic issue, and to economic issue,
Video: Comment: The America is in crisis.
The file that the whole whole is: our dependence from fossil fuels, like the fuel and oil oil oil and oil oil oil oil oil and oil oil oil oil oil oil oil oil oil and oil oil oil mate.
Now, yet, there's a new solution for ushes for ushes.
Real, 100 percent of clean energy -- 10 years.
And one plan to put America to the work, make us sure safe, and help to stop the global warming.
And finally, a solution that you get to solve our problems.
Rear America. You cover more.
Al Gore: This is the last one.
Video: Comment: It's about reeating energy to America.
One of the fastest ways to bring to dependence from fuels to kill our planet.
Comparsa: The future is here. Vently, sole, a new network net.
Comparate two: Nuovi investment for places of good work work work for a good job.
Compant: Repower America. It's time to be realists.
Al Gore: A old proverbial African said, "If you want to go speed from soliers.
If you want to go away from the mountain, you go toge."
We need to go far fast.
Thank you very much.
Last year, at TED I did a introduction on the LHC.
And I promises of return to argue about how the machine.
So here I do this -- and for those that the other time they didn't have it, the LHC is the most big scientific experiment, ever tried -- 27 miles of circuits.
His the job of reacting the conditions that were less than a billion of the universe -- until 600 million times a second.
And that's just the same as a lot of it.
This is the machine under Gineva.
We fit these min-Big Bang in the relevel.
This is what I work. It's called AS -- it's like 44 meters and it has a 222,000-meters and a 22,000-metmeters and 2meters and 22metry
This is an ATLATLAS in construction so you can see the proportions.
The 10 secember of the last year, we have accepted the car for the first time.
And this photograph was taken by ATLATLAS.
It was because of the immense in control.
It's a picture of the first fashion particles that had done all the LHC, and by collision, deliberately, with a part of LHC, and descator.
In other words, when we saw that 10 secember, we realized that the car works, which is a great living.
I don't know if it was doing this to do more than that, when somebody went on Google and saw on Google and saw that the beginning.
That means that we had a cultural impact beyond scientific impact on the scientific impact of the scientific impact of the scientific impact of beyond scientific impact on the scientific impact of the time.
About a week later, there was a problem with the machine, and it had to these files here -- these sleeps right now.
These files bring 13,000 prints when the car works.
Now, the technical between you look at the files and say, "It's not true. It's true.
And instead can do it because when I'm very fredynamed the superconductors.
So, at least 271 degrees, at a inferior at that space, these files can bring that current that current temperatures can bring that current up.
In one of the junctures in the LHC, there was a fabrication.
So the files of warming and 13,000 prints suddenly met a electrical resistence.
This was the result.
Now, this is even more impressive if you think these magnets, and you think these magnets, and that have been moved about 30 centimeters.
It has been damaged about 50 magnets.
We had to take them to take it to take it to do it.
We have repristinated and update and update it.
Now they're now coming back to them from their place.
I just just take the LHC will be the new intea.
And we accenderemy, and we expect to get some data to get the right data or him, and continue to find out what are the morning to find out what are the universe.
Now, of course, in a way, these are reaccending debate the debate on the value of science and engineering.
I think the fact that it's so hard to go beyond the fact that it's the value of things like LHC.
I would like to conclude with the words of a scientist in English, Humphrey Davy, the qual, I guess in defense of the experiments of the human conquitery was Michael Faday, said, "No is a lot of dangerous for the human mind of the human mind is definitely that we don't have a new month of the human conquareas as as as as a conquareas as as as as as as we don't have to conquisten by conquently conquinct to to conquinct to new monicate for a new conquincincincincess to new monmonicle of conquitive to be of a new and that we are of conquorate of a a new and that is is is is is is that we are of a
Thank you.
I want to start asking you to rethink about how children, you play in the morning.
As you realize how to reach them and to make them and to make them and move and you learn how to think about solve problems and make it and make it and make it constructions.
The space, is deeply connected to the way we understand a lot of the world around us.
So, by the informatic inspired by the useful of our interaction with physical objects in my own consultator, and my collaborator Jevan Kalthanithi, I started asking, "And when we use a computer -- instead of having the only digital cursor of having the only digital wise, so we can actually move on a physical way to a remarkable information with both of entreretailed to redad and really,
and we have it to our pleasant pleasure
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer, building the answer, building Siftable.
And in a few words, a Siftable computer.
And in a few words, a Siftable computer.
You can move with the hand, they can see the man, they can see their movement and they have a screen and a wireless radio wireless and radio wireless
But especially are objects like the morning, you can just move it by by by the way,
Siftable is an example of a new ecosystem for a new ecosystem information.
And as they become more physicists, you know, you knew about movement, others, and as they become more physics, and as they become more physics, and they get more physics, and others, how we move and exploring new stypes.
He started with some simple example.
This Siftable is configured to show vide: if you include it it into a direction, the video rotate video will roll out of the other hand, you know, if you include the other hand, you know, if you include it in a direction, the other hand, you know, if you include it in a direction, the way you get back.
These interactive ratives you that have others.
If you stand they are interested in what they are interested in what they would be done.
If they come and you can again and they can again again a little bit.
If they come and you can again and they can again again a little bit.
They also have their movement and including them movement.
We then realized that one of the interesting interesting interaction was the way to use community of the interaction was able to use community of the data as if it was a liquid.
In this case, we have three Siftable configured like a green blood and I can use them to look at the color in the central that they miles.
and I can use them to look at the color in the cent, where they miles.
If we are too much of it, we can put a little bit of the place.
And I'm also nice to be good apprint, as languages, the mathematics and games of the logical things that people can try and see the results of the immediately.
Now I'm --
This is a Fibonacy that I do with a equations.
Here we have a game of words that is half a Scarabeum and Boggle.
And so so we got a letter to get a literal literal literal to every Siftable, Prrrically, at every turns, and you know, you know, you know, and you try to make a dictionary.
And then about 30 seconds remissed and you have a new set of readers and new possibility.
Thank you.
So here of the kids came to the Media Lab, I did it so that they tried them and I turned a video video video video video.
They have a lot of please.
And one of the interesting things about this kind of application is that you don't have to give you a lot of educational things.
You just have to say, "Compion" of the word," and they know exactly what to do.
So that's what other people who are they trying it.
This is our younger better, there is the younger testers there.
It was actually just going to get them.
They only were morns, for him.
Now, this is an interactive cartoon interactive.
We wanted to build a tool for the learning of the ling-Hui Felix.
It can be able to put new characters in the scene, satis; they associated with Siftable and associated with it.
It can be able to put new characters in the scene, satis; they associated with Siftable and associated with it.
And that's doing the sun.
Video: The only is surprise.
David Merrill: Now it led a treatment in the scene.
Video: The treatment treatment.
Bel work!
So I suspect Siftable and put it close can interact the characters --
Video: Bau!
-- by inventing your history.
Video: HHHo!
DM: It's a story with the open final open up, and it can decide him as you know.
DM: It's a story with the open final open up, and it can decide him as you know.
Video: Golvia, gatto.
DM: The last example I have time to show you is a too, and make a recently -- to sampling and execececting music.
It's a too, made recently recently, for camping and exeguing music.
Siftable here are acting from suundy and bacteria --
Every one of these has four different variations, and you can choose what you use it.
You can put these sound sound in a compounds to be to get to your pleasure.
And to modify it just by doing a sound sound."
These are actually you can control from living and the film.
You attacks to a particular sum and then including them to address.
And then there are the effective as long and volume, which you can be able to the entire sequence.
Let's look at how it works.
Video: DM: We will we put a basic in two Siftable "sequenc," we put it in a series, the extend to the other low.
I put a bunch of mous.
Video: DM: I give percent of ussions.
Video: DM: And now I'll put the filtery, so I can control the effect of the live.
Video: DM: I can speak the entire sequence by a side or from the other side or from the other.
Video: DM: And I'm going to add the bottom of expression.
Video: DM: I can recombined the Redwood."
So I don't have to plan before, but I can sudden, but I can improvide it longer or longer than a longer or longer or longer than a longer or longer or longer or long.
And now, finally, I can smoke the entire sequence by the Siftable "volume."
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is to build new interfaces of man-machine man-machine and more similar and the body.
And today, I had time to show you one of the results, and also some chance that we try to bring out from the lab.
The concept I want to turn you is that it's coming this new generation of objects designed to interact with digital digital media media in the way we want to do that we want to do is that we want to get this new generation of objects that we want to put you to turn to do is that you want to put to do is that you want to put you to get this new generation of objects that I want to turn to do with digital pattern to do with digital patter
Thank you very much.
I don't see the time to talk to all of you.
I'm a writer.
And I wrote books is my profession, but it's more than that, of course,
It's also love and the fall of my life.
And I don't expect to be changed.
But I said that, something particularly happened recently in my life and in my life and careera, which led me to realibrate the entire relationship with this work.
The particular thing is I have recently replaced this book, "Mangia, Prega, Prega, and and the quality, and and all of my books, different prizes -- for some reasons that he came up a great sense,
And the result is that everywhere you go to me as if you convicted me as if you convicted it.
It is true -- convicted -- convicted it!
They are now all concerned and I said, "You don't have fear you can't do anymore,
You don't keep writing for all the life without any more to be able to create a book that can care about someone?"
that can care about someonon?"
It's rassicurant, you know.
But it could go worse -- I remember that more than 20 years ago, when I started to say to people -- I was a adolescent -- I wanted to be a writer.
I would put it on the same reaction of the land.
And people said, "You don't have to be able to have succeed?
You don't have fear that the hummmulti-refute kill?
You don't fear to do this mestize all the life without any infrance you ever come out and die on a cool, to die of saming with your mest-hand boud bank you to failing energy.
So, so you know.
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is: "Yes."
And I fear of all those things.
I always had fear.
And I also have a lot of other things that people can't even even even guess
As the algae and other things that we have.
But as it is what I thought and ask me for what I thought and ask me the point is why?
Is it ration?
It's logic that anyone should be spending by a work that you feel like to be sent to do.
But what is that particularly in creative impremise creative to make us about the mental health of the mental health in a way that other careful careers don't do that?
As my father, for example, he was a chemistry engineer and I don't remember one time in its 40 years of activity that he was asked if he was afraid engineer to be engineer to be engineer capit?
It was never -- that block of John, how do you you?
It wasn't working, right?
And so so chemistry engineers don't have certainly in the sea -- and he gained the reputation of being alcoil.
We writers, we have enough this reputation and not only writers but creatives of any general, we have this reputation of being enormous instable to lit instable,
And it's not else to look at the triste contacts of magnifies of the magnifies that creative is that only in the twentiential two-century and often often for them.
And even those who don't have been suicide to be really dissed by their womans.
Norman Mailer, before we die, in the last interviews, "I s" a little bit more than the provide of the provide of the provide of the work of its life.
But we don't dought when we hear it tells us why we heard these things so long, and we have all completely interior and accepted the notion and suffering is somehow you have a kind of legate and suffering, and the wind, will always be in some kind of legacy.
And the question I want to bring all to everywhere today is you can agree with this idea?
You can all you have this thing -- because you look at a centimeter of distance distance to me not for this supposition.
I think it's odied.
And I think it's also dangerous, and I don't want to see the perpetuated in the next century.
I think it's better to encourage our great creative minds to live there.
And because I know that in my case -- in my case, it would be very dangerous to start out to be suppositions, especially you give them a lot of the circumstances that are in my career.
And it is really -- I think I'm pretty young people, I have about 40 years.
I have still about four decades of work in me.
And it's very likely to be that anything I write about to then will be judged by the world as the work that came after the last book.
He slaves, because we're all more or less friends here -- is likely to my greatest success is to my own shoulder.
Oh, Gesus -- which is thinking.
You know, this is the kind of thinking, that brings a person to begin to be, and I don't want to do it.
I would just just just continue to do this work we do.
So, the question becomes like, right?
And so I was there, after many reflective reflection that the way to work and write is to create a psychological cooking costructure, right?
I have a few way to find a distance of security between me, which I am write and my natural will be going to get to get and find out for all the year, and I was trying to get to look at the time, trying to find other societies to see other societies and find other societies to see if they could have some best ideas and more health and more blood and more health and more blood and more health and more and more blood than the most health and more and more health and more blood and more blood and
how to help people create creative inerent emotional inerent risks of creativity.
And that research me brought me to the ancient Room.
And I can go back to the circle and then back back back back.
In ancient Great and ancient Rome -- people didn't look at creativity that creativity came from man, OK?
It was thought that creativity was this spirit looks like the man who came out and who came out of men and unknows -- and unknown and unknows, for reasons and unknows.
The Greeew would be these spirits look at the creativity of creativity "demoni."
Socrate, wonderful creating to have a demon that hearge wisdom from far away.
The Romans were the same idea, but they called that kind of spirit without a genius
And that is great, because Romans didn't think a genius was a genius was a genius was a smart of a genius was a very smart of a genius was a very smart of a genius was a genius was a very smart of a genius was a very smart genius was a very smart of a genius was a genius was a genius of a a genius was a particular mind.
And they believed that a genius was this sort of divine entity that was actually living in the study of a artist, a little bit like the Hif Dobby, and who came out to assisting the work of the artist and to model the work of that work.
Ecceptional -- yeah, that's the distance of what I talk -- that cooked psychological that you protect you from the results of your work.
And everybody knew it was so that it worked, right?
So the anti-who were protts of certain things, as a narcissssm, right?
If your work was exceptional you couldn't get all the degree and all knew that he was helped by this incorporeum of incorporeum of incorporeum of incorporea.
If your fail, it wasn't all of your fail, right?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be a incapable to be a incapable
And so people handed the creativity in Ockets for a long time.
And then the Rinddate and everything change, and then this great idea, we put the human being to the center of the universe and the mysteries and mysteries and mysteries that write details of divinity.
This was the principle of the humanth rational and people started to think the creativity came to think creativity was completely dividing.
And for the first time in history, you begin to this or that artist as a pretty pretty fairly to a person with a kind of a genius to a person with genius.
And I have to tell you, I think it was a big mistake there.
I think that allow someone, a simple person to believe that being a recipe as a recipe as a recipe and the surprising mysteries and and required is a responsibility responsibility to the fragile that human.
It's like to ask someone to ingowearing the sun.
It degree and distores all these ingestious ingestiable ingestive expectations of the performance.
And I think it was this pression to have destroyed the artists in the past-year-olds in the past.
And if this is true, and I think it is, and I think, the question becomes and ear?
Can we do it different?
And you can go back to a more ancient understanding of the relationship between humans and mystery creative mystery
or maybe not.
Maybe we can't cell 500 years of thinking about rational thinking about a 18 minutes.
And probably people have people in the audience that would be a lot of scientific suspects about the notion of scientific suspect people who follow the following their projects.
And probably not probably convinced you all about this thing.
But the question I would like to bring is -- why right?
Why don't you think about this way?
Because it has more sense of any other thing that has ever heard of creative explain the creative process.
And one process that you ever have to do something -- therefore, fundamentally, all here -- yeah, you don't have rational behavior.
And in fact, it can sometimes be completely paranormal.
I did this recently with the remarkable Ruth poetc. And it was a few years but that was a poet-year-old, and he said during his childhood in the Virginia, worked out in the Virginia, and he felt it was going to be in the landscape in the landscape from landscape.
And he said it was like a fragorous fragorous frageous frageous phrageous phrageous frageous fragorous fragorous fragorous fragorous of it.
And he came out of rolling out of the landscape.
And it was going to get it to get the land under its feet.
He knew it was to have one thing to do to that point and it was like, "to run as a morn."
And it was going to go to the house and was followed by this poetry, and it wouldn't have to get a piece of paper and a matters pretty quickly as the trading, and collecting it on the page.
Sometimes it could not be able to be quite quickly, so it correct and correct and she was going to get to the house and she was the lost and she was loved and she was loved and she was going to roll through the landscape, as she said, "another poet."
And then there were -- this piece I will never forget, and there were any time that was nearly lost moments where it was almost lost you?
So, it was going to come home and he was looking for card and the card was going through and he was a matters right in that he was going to go and then he was like, he was like to the other hand and the off.
And he was offered the poetry from and and he would put it in his body and it was in his body and transcriving on the page.
And in these cases, the poetry would be presented on the perfect page and intattached but the contrary word at the last word at the first word at the first word at the first word at the first word at the first word at the last word at the first word at the first word at the first word at the first word at the first word at the first thing to the first word at the first word at the first thing was the first word at the first thing to the first time.
So when you hear it was a crazy -- it's just a crazy to my creative process.
I don't think of my creative process -- I'm not a conduct conduct!
I'm a mult, and my way to work is -- wake up to the same orary every day and I can go and go and work and go over and go and go over and go and go to all over the time.
But even I was in my headgin, I have strike against that thing, and you check with the time,
And I imagine that many of you have been done.
You know, even if the work and ideas came from a certain source of it would not be knowing it.
And what is this thing?
And how can we relate to it in a way we don't do lose us to do that we have to stay sleep?
And as I think about it, the best example I have is the best example I have is the Tom Waits, which I interviewed a few years ago for a newspaper.
We were talking about this, and you know, Tom, for the majority of life was the incarnation of the artist really, to control these species of impulsize, to make these kind of impulsize, and to dominate these kind of impulsides.
But then I agreed it, and one day while she was driving on onto a car in Los Angeles, changed all for him.
It was going fast, and all a lot of a tra-t-to-t-to-baby fragment and wish and walls, and the wish and wish -- you know, it's wonderful and the wish, you know, it's wonderful and the wish, but not as you know how to take it.
It doesn't have a piece of paper, it has no matter, it has no record.
So it starts to hear this kind of old anxiety to him, "I'm going to lose and remarrushed by this lost song of this lost sesemble.
I don't don't have enough enough and I can't do it."
And instead of going to stop.
And he was going to do the mental process and did something again.
And he just looked at the sky and said, "cuse, you can't see that I'm driving here?"
"Do you look like it can write a song onto the one-on-song song of onto the one-song song --
If you really want to exist, you get back to a more opport, when I can take care of you.
Others, you go to care anywhere else today.
You go to disturbing Leonard Cohen."
And his work process changed after that.
I don't work was the work of dark it as a seminal as a seminal time.
But the process, and the fishing that was released when the genius, the genius had been released when the genius was going to be doing anything else that issues and free it remained that it had to be a whole thing.
but it was a wonderful bizarre cool, wonderful bizarre that conversation between Tom and this external thing and the outside thing that was not Tom.
So as as I felt that story started to change a little bit how I worked and already saved me a time.
This idea, I was saved when I was writing "Mangia, Ama," and I got to a little bit of the disperation that we all when we are working on something and we can't begin to think that it's going to be a disaster, which is going to be the worst book that will be the worst book that will be the worst book that will be the worst book that would be the worst and written --
Not just a bad book --
And I started to think about throw this project.
But I reminded me of Tom who talk to the air, and I tried it.
So I went to my face on the mandark and I would say my comments to a empty corner.
And I said, "You know, you know, you know, you know, you know that if this book will not be brilliant, you know?
Because as I see I'm putting all that I haven't got to do that.
So if you want to be better you have to introduce and do your parts.
OK, but if you don't do it, you know, you don't know what, I don't know what,
I'm going to write the same because it's my work.
And I would like to pleased that I was on my own talk," because -- at the end is so so far -- at the end of the North Africa -- the century of North Africa people would raduned for the long dances of the dances of the long dance, dances and music, dance, dances that went to the walk and until the heba.
And they were always magnificent because the ballers were fantastic.
But every time, it was something happened, and one of these artists became actually translent reality.
And I know you know what I talk about what you do, because I know you have seen it all of it, a little bit like this.
It was like time you stops, and the dance, and it was not doing anything different from the site and was not doing anything different from the sun, like 1,000 nights -- but all you sweet.
And suddenly it doesn't just like a human.
But you accese from the divine in and devessels in the deves.
And when this next time, this next time, people knew what he was -- people knew what he was -- they called her name.
They were the hands and began to clear, "Allah, God God, Did, God, God, God, God, God, God, God."
That's God, you know.
And he was a storic -- when the Mors, the Spay's Spaya, they had this abitude with their and ready one changed in the centuric of "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah,
In Spayna, when a artist has done something impossible and magic "Hey, magnifi, you know, magnifi, you know, a fair, and it -- a flow-toos.
And it's great, because we need it.
But the problem comes up and then the dance, for the ballery itself, when you wake and discovers that are 11 in the morning, and the last last of Dod is 9//11.
It's just a mortal with a great male with a great male to the knee, and maybe it will never be able to get to that alt.
And maybe nobody will be the name of God still as yet, and what does it have it to do with the rest of his life?
It's hard to be hard.
This is one of the most painful reconciliations to do in a creative life.
But perhaps it doesn't have to be so angoscious if you can not believe it, but for the most extraordinary thing you are being being from you to stessi.
But it just believes you are data in prester by a imaginable founds of this team of your life that you have to go to somewhere else you have gotten and you have a wind.
And you know, if we think in this way it change.
And so I started thinking about it, and it's because I think about it for several months during the work of the book that I will do the work of the book that I will prester prestery of my great-success success success success --
And what I have to keep telling me when I feel electric from this is, not having a land.
Let me just just just your work.
It is to introduce your parts, any of them can be.
If your work is dance, ball;
If the divince, I assurd to you know, and I decided to leave a few kind of wonderful for a few wonderful time through your efs, then "O!"
And you did the same thing.
And "Oh, you know, you know?
I think I think you should teach it.
"You know, you know, even for you have a human and testing and tests and testing talks to you all the way to make it continuously.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
As you know I've been talking about some of these projects on the genome of the genome and discovered about new genes.
We're now starting a new percorator and we started to digitalize biology and now starting from that digital code we are in a new fashion biology, designing and synthesizing life.
We always tried to ask some big questions.
"What is the life?" is something that many biologists I think have been trying to understand level.
We tried several approved, reducing the minimes of terms.
We're digitalize by almost 20 years ormas.
When we sequenced the human genome was treating from the analogical world, the biological world.
Now we ask our: can we regenerate the life, or create new life from this digital univer?
This is the map of a little organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, which is the species from the genome genome that can authoring in the lab.
And we tried to reduce the genome to create a more smaller than that.
We can eliminate a center of genes about 500 that are here.
But when we look at its metabolic map of metabolic map to the nostr.
I think, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate a time, it's very unlikely to be able to bring a living cell.
So we decided that the only way to progressive was synthetize this column so that we could modify the components to bring some of these fundamental questions.
And so we started the advantage of "Can we can synthesize a chromosound to the tail?"
Can you make chemistry to produce these great molecules that we haven't been able to create before you?
And in a business case, we can make a chromosom to work a chromosom like this?
A chromosome, it's just a piece of chemistry material.
The speed with which we are able to digitalize life is growing and exponential res.
Our ability to write the genetic code, ages, which is rather than slowly slow down.
And our most recently results the leading exponential curve.
We started more than 15 years ago.
And the process has required a lot of passages, we start with a bioetic review before we begin the first experiments.
But we found out that DNA is very difficult.
There are decades of thousands of cars in the world that produce little segment segment of 30 to 50 letters and it's a degenerative proces: the most segment is longer than the segment is longer than we are.
So we had to develop a new method to assembling these fragments and reach the mistakes and reach the mistakes.
And this was our first attempt to start from Phi digital information of the genome of Phi X 174.
It's a little virus that kills kills kills you.
We designed the fragments, effective reportation of the errors and we had a molecule of DNA of about 5,000 letter of DNA --
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemistry material and we put it into the bacteria bacteria have begun to read this genetic code and to produce particles.
The virals have been release from the cell phone have come back and have destroyed the E.
I talked about recent with members of petrorolife's said that they have certainly understood this model.
They have more than you.
We believe that this is a situation where software can really build its own biological hardware in a biological system.
But we wanted to do the biggest things that are larger.
We wanted to build the bacteria of the bacteria --
It's over 580 miles yet code of genetic code code --
So we thought we could build it in the size of virus, so that we can change the survey to understand what the components are the living cell of a living cell.
The design is crucial and if we start with digital information in a computer, these have to be very accurate it.
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995, the standard accuratength of a mistake for every 10 mile mile mile --
We have discovered, 30 mistake it -- 30 mistakes. If we had that original sequence we never had been able to do it work.
A part of the process is designing down 50 letters that are long-lay segment with all other segment segment of 50 letters to build underunits of smaller than 50 letters to build underunits
We try to provide onto here.
You probably have you read that we put the fliglass.
So, you think this is that we have a genetic code on four letters, Ac, G, and T.
Three of those readers and they have about 20 administrate about 20 administry and have a specific order of reading for every administration for every administration of beating for every administry
So we can use genetic code to write words, fraish, thought.
What we did at the beginning was authography.
Some people have been dolphuses from the fact that it wasn't poetry.
We designed these segment sitting just to unize with the essential of them.
There are enzymes that are and put them and put them asyme.
And we started to get out of the parts, starting with five to seven miles letter from five to seven miles in a way to forming sitting 24 miles at the letter to the task of 24 miles at the liter.
And every past we have produced these sites in abundance so that we are trying to create a very robate proception -- as you will see in a minute.
We're trying to automatize the process.
So, this seems to the tabellon a baskets.
When we get these very long-mile segments more than 100 miles, it will not grow more directly in E.
You get to the limits of modern molecular biology molecular biology.
So we looked at other mechanisms.
We knew another mechanism called recombination recombination called recombination respect and biology is useful to repair the DNA to unize the DNA to unize the chance of DNA and to make the chance of a mechannel.
Here's an example.
This organism, called Deinococcus radioens, it can ababsorbs three million rad rds.
You can see in the distract of the cromosome, you can see in the ground of the chromosome.
In 12 -- 24 hours is reassembled exactly as it was before.
There are thousands of organisms that have been able to do that.
These organisms can be touch completely.
They can live under empty.
I'm absolutely sure life exists in space, and you smooth to find new rich environments.
And it turns out the NASA showed that this avene.
This is a picture of the molecules that we built using these processes -- just using the light-re-in-re-inserious design of inserious sitting in the slate of inserious swing of the molecule.
The lightweight them up,
This image was not taken with a electronic microscope -- but with a regulating microscope of rule.
It's a molecule so great that we can see with a slightly lay microscope.
These are pictures that they cover a period of six seconds.
This is the advertising that we did a little time ago.
It's more than 580,000 letters of genetic code code code
It's the largest molecule of a defined structure that ever created by the man.
It has a 300 million ones.
If we spent it with a 10 paper without spaces, it would like 142 pages to just turn this genetic code to turn this genetic code.
Now, how do we do it work? How can we activate them?
Of course, you get a virus is a game of a gents.
It's a little more complicated when you use bacteria --
It's simpler even when it's about the eucariote as we can just extract the nuclear and you can just extract it up and you can just get a way, which is basically the process of clonation.
In the bacteria I have the chromosome, but we recently demonstrated in the cell but we recently showed that we can do a birth of a cell cool ccell to another and active to another and activity to another and active to the mosome,
We purified a mosomsome,
The two are several as men from topis.
We added a few gene more in a way that we could decide what to chromoos.
And it took it to the enzyme with the enzyme to kill all the protection.
And when we put it in the cellula was stupending -- and you open our graphic graphic -- the new chromosome, the new chromosome,
And we were thinking that we couldn't go that we could not go older, but we have been trying to pushing us over there.
This is one of the greatest mechanisms of evolution.
We found that a lot of species have added a second or a third chromosomes somewhere, I added a second thousands of new trats trats to that species.
So who think about evolution as a only gene to evolution as a gene to the biology.
There are enzymes called the restrippping enzyme is that they actually address.
The chromosome, it was in the cell of it could be one.
Mphphphony that we have inserito-to-away.
And it turns out that you know, and it recognized, and it has been reported with only the mosome, and we have been reported with only the cellula and the new coccell chromo.
It became blue because of the genes we have inserved.
And in a short time, all the characteristics of a species have gone lost went lost and transformed all in a new species, based on the new software that we inserved in the cell phone.
All the protein has changed, membrings have changed, and when we read the genetic code the equipment to what we have transfited.
Now, this might seem alchemical alchemy that we can change things in a pretty replace.
Now, I already explained that you don't talk about genesis -- but by three million and a half million and a half a million and a half and a half a million and a new version of Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosion process.
Why do you do that?
I think it's quite obvious when we think of our necessity.
We're going to go from six and a half billion people in the next 40 years.
Just to give you an example: I am born in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for each one exist, in 1946; it will be four to be four to be four of them will be four to be there.
We're going to find food, water and clean and clean and clean and clean medicinal and dances for six and a half billion people.
It will be even more harder to do it for nine bills.
We use more than five billion carbon dioxiety barrels.
That means a million barrels a day.
When we try to find biological processes or any kind of process to replace it, it will be a huge challenge challenge.
And more we have to keep the whole hemission of CO2 from these materials that end up in the atmosphere.
On day, because of scientific discoveries in the world, we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I like to think that are the design components for the future.
The electronic industry is only a dozen about components, and think about how many different things have come out of the things that are coming out of the several things have been out there.
Our limitations are now now now from biological reality and our imagination.
Now we have some techniques to these rapid rapid methetization, can create what we call a combinator.
We can build a big robots that can produce a million chromosomes a million chromosomes a day.
Think of process, these 20 million genes of different genes or to try and optimize the processes to produce either and drugs, we can change and make more biology than in the last 20 years of science.
And it's just a standard.
We can chance to survive the chimical or of carbon and carbon dishing ethc.
This is an instant-software programs that we're working to be able to sit to sell us and design species to sell us and designing species to the computer.
Well, we don't know how much they do.
We know exactly how their code is their code
Now we're focusing on fourth generation.
You have seen you that you can extract ethanol, and you have been a mouthblew experiment.
We have carbon on on on the third generation that will use enough carbons to the higher than the either as the either as the either as the either either ones that are either than some threatening or different kinds of thrown --
But the only way biology can have a great impact without increasing the cost of food and and limiting the cost of food and and limiting the die will be transforming the CO2 material that we're working to design cells that we are working to design that we can achieve this purpose cells that we can achieve that we can achieve that we can achieve that we can get the first carbon cells.
The sunlight combined with CO2 is a methodo-- but in our discoveries around the world, we found several methods.
This is a organism that we have described in 1996.
And it lives in the deep ocean to about 2,500 feet of the water temperature of the water.
It creates metane from CO2 molecular hydrogen molecular sources.
We're trying to understand if we can put the CO2, which can easily be transported by tube, conversation that CO2 in carbon and drive this process.
So we think a short we could be able to increase what the basic question "What is the life."
And it looks like TED, where you can'?
It would be a main source of energy sources.
And so we are working to use the same methods to create the instantee instants.
You saw this year with influence, we're always back, we're always back, and a dollar, at least when it comes to find the right vaccine vaccine vaccine vaccine vaccine vaccine gun.
I think what you can change with combinable vaccines in anticipy.
And that's how the future could start change, the evolution, accellerating evolution with bacteria and accelerating evolution with bacteria bacteria and inally, and then finally cells.
We are so so much from improving people.
Our purpose is to do a long way to try to do a lot of time to try and do that. Thank you very much.
First of all I would see the fastest possible, some fundamental job, the new technology that we brought to Microsoft in a almost almost a year ago -- that's Seadragon.
It's a environmental level that you can interact with a huge amount of visual data that remote with a huge amount of visual data --
We're seeing a lot of gigabytes of digital pictures with a kind of coast and continue, for a very short speaker, and I have the images like that.
And it doesn't matter how big the amount of information that we see, how big the amount of data or images.
Most of them are communals, but this example is a scansion from the Library of Congress, and rewenters in the legal leg.
It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that the prestations of a system like this is the number of pixel on your screen in any moment. It's also a very flexible architecture.
This is a whole book of data not imaginy.
This is the Casa desolated of Dickens. Every colonna represents a capitulum.
To show you that it's just about testing and not imagines, we can do something like this, to see really really really really about a representation of the head, not a photoe.
It could be a little artificial book, to read a electronic book.
You don't have the address.
This is a more realistic example of the Guardian Lardian Wardian
Every image is the beginning of a selection.
And it really gives you the pleasure to read the beauty version of a magazine or a fifth of a magazine or a multiple of a multiple types of a methotid.
We also did something with the corner of this particular number in the Guardian Wardian.
We created a fasulla advertising advertising -- much more than you use in a normal advertising -- and we initiate content in a normal content ent content ent content ent content --
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile, you can see here.
or other models, or even specific specific specific specific
And this really demonstrates some of these ideas to heliminate the limits of space on the screen.
And we hope this gentlemended to put pop-up and other porcheries -- not to be necessary.
Of course, the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technologies.
And on this I don't want to lose time, if we don't say that we have contributed to the field.
These are all the streets in the U.S. spinal imagery of NASA.
So now we're going to go to something.
This is actually now from the webs; you can go to the webs; you can see it.
It's a project called Photosynth, which fights two different technologies.
One is Seadragon and the other is a very interesting visual computer computer that was in Noah Snavely, a student of Washington, with the help of Steve Seitz UWashington, with Microsoft and of Microsoft Research Research Research Research Szeli-Microsoft Research Research Research Research Snavely, a very interesting collaboration.
And it's from Seadrage to Seadrage from Seadragon.
You can see it when we do this kind of screen that we can go from one image to another and have this kind of experience.
But the space, the spacecraft of images here has actually a meaning.
The slumn of the computer have recorded these images together, so that they corresponding to the real places, so that you can imagine -- all the way you can imagine -- all of the way you can see the canahi Grassis on Montagne Rocks' Cs on the South Wels of a slide-show slide-show -- and these things have all space.
I don't know if I have to show you some other environment.
And there are some more space.
I want to spend one of the original data set of Noahan data that we have been from a precedent prototype of Photosynthosynthosynthosynthose, to show you what I think is really the key key behind this technology, Photosynthosynthosynthose. And it's not necessarily so much evident to the environment.
We had to worry about the legal aspects and so forth.
This is a reconstruction of Nots Dame images Flickr. Basta Flickr. Basta Flickr. Basta Flickr and you get images of types in the camps, and the camps. Every one of these arguys and say, "Can these arances --
So I'm all images that Flickr and have been all connected to space, in this way.
And it's possible to be to navigate in this simple way.
You know, I would never have thought of finish to work for Microsoft.
It's very gratificing this kind of account here.
I think you can see that it's a lot of different types of framework of framework in the SLR, a a significant number of meaningful photos.
And if I can try and find those more stranger.
Many of you are blocks, eter.
Some part here you have a series of photographs -- there it is a series of pictures.
This is a poster of Nots Dame recorded right right now.
We can go from the physics of this environment.
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment. This is now taking data from everyday of the whole memory of how to appear the ground of how to appear to the grow from the point of viewing visual points -- and connects all those data together.
All those pictures become connected together, more than the parts.
You have a model of the land that emerge.
Think about this as a promote of Stephen Lawler on Earth virtual Techance on Earth virtual.
It's something that grows in complex as people as they use it, and the people who use, and the advantage for those who uses who uses the use.
Those pictures are marcked with metadhited by other people.
If you get the idea of contrast all these sants say, my picture of the Nots of Nots Dame sudral. And I can use it as a provide of all those data data and I can use how to sweet you can use it to ressswitch to the space, and having a a social experience.
Of course, a consequence of all these are extremely elaborate models of every interesting part of the earth -- collective and and satellitary imagery and satellitarian imagery and satellitar imagery.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I realized good? What your software will convey us to do is that at a certain point, in the next few years, all the pictures of shared in the world or will be basically connected to the whole world or will be basically connected to the whole world or will be connected to the whole world or will be basically connected to do is that you can do is that you can do is that you have to do is that at a certain point in the world or will be be connect?
BAA: Yeah. What is doing is doing it is discovered.
It's creating hyperlink, if you want to be empty with the images.
And it's doing it in the content of imagins.
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the rich of semantic information that many of these images have itself.
As you do a research of images on the web, you know, a fruiting and the head on the page of the pictures.
Now, what happens if you connect to all your phote?
So the amount of semantic interconnections, and the amount of recipe that comes to it is really enormous. It's a classical classical classic.
CA: Blaise, it's really incredible.
BAA: Thank you very much.
One of the pleasure when you travel and one of the etnographic research is the way to live between who didn't forget the antic antic antic antic antic and traditions, the text in the wind, today's ged in the wind of the pletnographic and the plants.
I think that monkeys Jaguar traveling the Way, or that the Milky Lattea, or that the old Himalaya, or that in Himalaya, the budged of the Dharm, and the budger of Dharm, to recall the central importance of the Earth, and the idea that the world we live in absolute, but it's just a reality model of reality, but it's just a model of reality,
the consequence of a particular adapt of adapted adapted that our stirpe has been done or mal, many generations ago.
And of course, we all share the essential trates.
We all hidden we all for.
We are subjects to reach respects of initiation.
We need to deaths the inesorability of death, so we don't have to surprised and whales --
We all have a art.
What it is the particular one of the canzone, the rhythm of every culture.
It doesn't matter that they are the Borneo, or the Borneo, or the follows of Haiti, or Haiti, or the warriors of Kaised, or a camelel camels, or a cameleras a cameline in the heart of the Sahara.
He was my company in the desert a month ago, or a month ago, or a hallevator of yak in the Qomolang, on Everest, the mother of the world.
All of these people teach us that there are other ways of thinking about exists, other ways of thinking, other ways of you move in the world.
And if you look at a time, it's a concept that can give you hope.
Inside, the cultures of the world creating a spiritual ragn, and cultural life that has the planet and cultural and cultural that has the planet and it's important for the benefit of the planet as a biosphosphosphic biosphosphere.
And you can think about this cultural ragning like a ethnosfer and you can define the etnospher's representing of all the concepts, mitions, ideas, inspirations, unctions, ideas, inspirations, which is the human as the beings of consciousness.
The etnospher's the fabulous pathrimony.
It's the symbol of what we are and what we can be in how much initives.
And because biosphere has been seen, as it was several as it has been so much faster and unfortunately too fast.
No biologist, for example, it would say 50 percent of all the species is about the extract of the extract of the extract of the extreme -- in the most apocalittic field -- and you don't have to have a little bit of biological power.
The indicate of all that is, of course, the loss of language.
When you're born 6,000 languages on this planet.
A language is not only a vocabulary or from a series of gragragramatics.
A language is the price of human spirit --
It's the half with which the animation of every culture, it comes in the material.
Every language is a forest of the mind, a swe, a spiritual ecosystem of spiritual chance of spiritual chance of spiritual chance of spiritual chance of spiritual chance of spiritual chance of spiritual chchance of spiritual chance of a spiritual chance of the minritual chance of a spiritual thoughts.
And of those 6,000 languages, as we are sitting in Monterey, at least half the time is not more sussurrated in the ears.
They don't get to the kids, which means to less you came, at least not cambas a little bit of something that is already dead.
What is that more tristates of being flight-silence to be the last talking to a language, of not having a way to get the slads or anticipate the promise of the children?
This is a time to some people in the world every two weeks of the world every two weeks a late die and brings them to the bottom of a language language --
And I know someone to say, "Is it better than that?
The world would not be a better place if we were all the same language?" So we talk all yoreba. We all yoruba. Let's talk about a cantonce.
We talk to be a kogi.
And you will do that you can't talk about your language.
I would like to do a journey through etnosfera's eetnosspaper --
a little journey in the etnospher's above what we're lost.
Many of us forget that when I say, "different ways of exists."
We take for example, this Barasana, in Amazonia in Amazony, the people of anacony, which credad to provide from the fabulous fillers of the milk of the milk of the milk of sacries.
It's a popular that is not able to distinguish the blue color because the celest, celest, which is identified in the forest time that it depends the population.
They have a strange language and a matrimonial rule rule -- "exogamia languages.
And all of that has been rooted in the pastological family is that in these extract families that you talk to you are or seven lings, because of the mysteries no practice.
They are limiting and then they start talking about.
We take one of the most interesting tribes with which I lived Waorans from Ecuador of Ecuador Borananans, a incredible popular popular that has had the first contatts in 1958.
In 1957 five misionary have tried to a face.
They made out of the top pictures that they would reach them into a few that they were loved loads, dimenticating that this people of pluvial forest that had never seen anything two-dimensional bi-dimensional.
They ran pictures from the ground, they turn to the search of a shape or a fold, they didn't find it in the diavolual diles, and they kill five mission with the lances.
But Waorans didn't just kill the stranimal for.
They have to kill them in the way.
55 percent of the death was caused by their own own people.
We have been hotto eight generations and we found two natural deaths and when we put it for saper, they had a bit of their age again was again again that is dead. And then they kill it itself. And then they kill it itself.
The caccidents were able to recognize the urine urine from 40 steps and recognizing the species.
In the first '80s, I was assigned a really interesting job when my Harvard professor of Harvard asked me if I wanted to go to Haiti to me to Haiti to the basis of Duvalive. And Tonton Macoutes, and Tonton Macoutes, and I impossessed to use the wild of the velended to use the hombies.
To make sense of miraculous myself I would have to understand Voodoo culture.
It's pretty a metaphor or or complext of the world.
Very interesting --
If I asked you to tell me the great religions, what would you say about the world, what would you say about the world religions.
Cristianth Islam, Buddismo, Ebraism, etc.
And a continent is always leavored by thinking that sub-Saharan Africa has no religious phones. And instead of hoodoo is that the distilled of these very profound religious religious and the Voodoo and fasporate in the slavery of the slavery of the slavery of the slavery of the slavery deep on the slavery of the slavery of these de-Saharan Africa has been left and and
What makes you interesting your voodoo is the intense of life and death.
So you live in the spirits.
The spirits can be invocated by Grande Aqua, they respond to the rate of the dance and dance of dance and so that it was so so much for a long active way to the follow becomes the following becomes the die.
For this voodooists to say, "You want to white you go to close to talk about God.
We get the time in the theme and we become God."
And from the moment you are possed, is the spirit you can do you have to do you about the mal?
So you look at these incredible events -- following you on these incredible events that touch emptize emptizing empty emptizing a pretty strong demonstration of the mind on the body when it catalized in a state of extreme extreme to a state of extreme to be in a state of extreme extreme to be in a state of extreme that touch of the mind on the body when it catalymest.
And you all the people with which I lived the most extraordinary Kogi of Sierra Nevada Santa Marckey Marcketbs.
And the descends of the ancient civilization that once lived on the careers of Colombia in attempt to the career mass of the Colombia in the carbolombia that would be on the carbolic pieces on the carbe.
In a macky continent of blood continent has never been conquitted by the spagnot.
And yet today, it's governed by a click but their formation is decided.
The young people following out of the family to three or four years, and they live in a world of good and homber, and they live in a world that was a good and stone hair for 18 years.
Two time of nine years of proposited to reduce the nine months of management that transitate in the mother, now are metaphorically in the uteration of the Grande Mad.
For this time, we accultured to the values of their society, values that they previous prayers and only their prayers and only their prayers -- or to say the ecologic balance -- or to say the ecologic balance --
At the end of this incredible initiation, they suddenly brought out and for the first time in my life in the age of 18 years, they see a tree of consciousness -- when the sun of the beautiful beauty valley valles and the sun is a very much landscape is a conference of this is a past of the beautiful landscape is a past and say, "Just a past of the splan to be --
"You know, I like you as I have detail.
It's stupend. Now it's you to protect it."
They call that the greatest brothers and say that we are the colpe-brothers of the world.
This level of intuition is extremely important.
When we think about Indian populations and we invote Rousseau and the old story of the noble nowl story of the noble notion in its simplicity or maybe I met Thorm Thorm Thorcheck and say these populations are closer to the Earth of us.
The Indian people are not not feeling nize,
There is no space for these things in the malaric stageum in the gelidy of Tibet, but because of the time and reports, they created a mystic of the Earth not on the conception of being able to be able to be a little bit more sub-beyond -- the conception that the Earth can only be because it's infuse of human consciousness,
What does it mean by that?
It means that a guy in the Ande that is a guy who is creating that mountain is a spirit of Apu that will be a human being being being deeply and will have a drink of a fun that place to a drink that place to a very different with the mountain or that place to a mountain Montana that is a mountain a mountain a mountain of rock that is a mountain a mountain a mountain of rock that place and a mountain of a a b.
which is the didy of a spirit or a mineral is irrizing.
What is interesting is the metaphor that define the relationship between individual world.
I grew up in the forests of Columbia Britain, believing that the forests had been cut.
And this is a different from my friends Kwakiut, who believe that the forests are the forest and the walls of Hukuk and the beyond the walls of paradit and the rural beetry of the world, spirits that live on the world, spirits that are living in the Hamats' beginning.
If you start to look that these cultures can actually create different reality, you can start to understand some sense-sensational.
I took this pictures to open the nordoctory in nordoctor.
Maybe some of you heard of ayahuase, the most powerful support supports of the repertoday's repertoo.
What makes a fascinating ayahuas's potential is not the potential to the support of the support, but its processing processing. It's composed two elements.
And then one hand, this legacy legacy that has a series of better-carbols, harmine and harmine mols, and harminous mols, and mols, and mols, and mols, and mols, and molecules, harminous of carbols, harmine --
And I take the only plant coffee is a filled that alters a little bit of consciousness, but it's measured with the falls of a coffee family Psychotria liver of coffee coffee and I sweet.
This plant, methoxyltryptamine-5, methyltryptamine-5, methoxyltryptamine-5, methoxyptamines.
If you ever see the Yanomami tiring on the nose that they do from a different set of species, and it has methoxyltryptption.
Tiring that polar is a little bit like being dissolved by a fillen filled by a fire-in-waves and land on a sea sea of electricity. Risthe] It doesn't create a distortion of reality.
I was often with my professor, Richard Evan Shultes, the man who took the psychopoppsychopopic discovered of the hallucinogens in the 1930s.
I think I can't be classify these triptamines like hallucinogens because if you're in fact you can't tell anyone to be hallucind.
It's possible to assume only if you put them on other submers with other subjects dening the MAO.
Now is the beauty beta-carboline that are initial inders of MAO, the same kind of necessary for triptamines. The question avoid better. The questions available triptamines that are in 80,000 species of plants, how these people are they going to find two dead-millions, but if you combined in this way, I think if you look at the sudanger to the sudperiod
We use the great euphemism of proof of and the error, which can revealing infruttly.
But if we ask Indians, they will tell us "Look at the plant."
What does it mean by that?
This tribe, Cof, Cofan, has 17 variety of ayahuas, and that they have a nitely in the forest, and that we have our eyes would come into the same species.
If we ask them how they were asked, "Think I thought to understand plants, "Think I realized about plants, I'm not know?" I said, "No."
The solution is: You get 17 variety in a night of the pile and each one will be with a different way.
With this is not a Harvard, but it's much more interesting than contare the same way.
Now, [applausies] the problem is that even those of us who have heart people who have emembees are painting but somehow you get them paints of the history of our real real world and goes beyond to the real world -- and it goes to fill it.
In fact, the X-century effect, 300 years, it will not remind for its wars or its innovations and innovations that but rather how we were in which we stopped and actively and actively accepted to the mass of mass and cultural diversity of biological diversity and cultural biological diversity of biological diversity and cultural problems. Now the problem is not change.
All cultures through the centuries have been involved in a dance for new possibilities of life.
And the problem is not the technology.
Indians have not been yield to be Sioux when they put it from the ark, and fresh so like Americans have no stopped being Americans when they put from horse and calm in the horse and calm of calm and calculations.
It's not the change or technology that threats the etnossphere. It's the poter.
The flit of the domination.
And if you look at the world, you will find that these aren't been culture is that these aren't been sated.
And I grew living creatures, and dynamic forces out of existence and identify and exact them that will be beyond their ability to adaptation.
I think it's disbodishing in the pathrie,
a people named Sarawak, in the Sarawak, in the Southern and the Cinese has been on the forest and now reduced to the prostitution, and now reduced to the retime-to-re-husband and that it can see the filled filled by the Merie Cinese Meria, which looks like the Meria Cinese Meria, where you can see the Japanese Merie Merie Cinese Merie Cinese Meria,
It ready to recover the stakes with the wooden bond to the forest.
Or in the case of Yanomami, are the diseases that have come with the discovery of the golden of the golden of the golden of the golden --
If we move on on the Tibet, where I'm doing a lot research, you can see the hard flit of political domination.
As you know the genocide -- the physical extract of a popular popular level, but the inncise of a popular style stype, not only is convicted to celebrate in certain environments, but celebrated in certain environments, because it makes part of the development strategic strategic strategic strategic of development.
And you can't understand the Tibet Tibet until you start to the beginning.
I lose the 6,000 miles from Chengdu in Western China through Tibet Tibet with a young line, and you just come to Lhasa young line, but only came to Lhasa statistics that we heard about it.
6,000 money money money.
1.2 million people killed by military in the Cultural.
The father of this guy was ascritated to Panchen Lama.
And that means that it was killed to be killed to the time of the Chinese agended.
He's southern Santity during the diaspora that led led the people in Nepal.
His mother was imprisoned and his copa was real.
It was brought to the age of two years from the age of two years from the age of two years from below her to the honna because it couldn't live without him.
The sister that he did the same, it was in reedual field.
One day he was indicated a fashion fasolk and the transgression, it was mitted to the forces of the transgression, was mitted to the forces for seven years.
Tibet Tibet can be inable, but the spirit of the people is from tennest.
And then you get it to a choice.
We want to live in the world's world of monotony or we want to get the policy world of different than diversity?
The great ancropologist Margaret Mead, before we will die that his greatest fear was that in our way to this love. And we go to this loved loving the whole legal legal of human imagination -- we will be able to be a conversal of thoughtnone disafe of thinking,
And it's hummmulti-recall that 600,000 years.
The Revolution in Neolitics, which has given us to the agriculture, which has done us to the seminal cult of the seminal classing with the classroom and we talk about 10,000 years ago.
The modern industrialized world has 300 years.
That shark is not suggests that we have the answers to all the challenges that we will have to deal with the challenges to come to the millennia.
When you look at these miriac miriades of the world is asked what it means to be human, respond to 10,000 different voices there.
And it's in these answers that we all have risking the chance to be what we are, a kind of consciouss, that must be able to make all the people and all the garden gardens can filliant reciptires.
I took this pictures of Baffects on the north island Baffin, when I went to the whales of the Inuit, and this man, Olayer -- he told me the wonderful story of his grandmomother's grandfather's grandfather's not.
The government canadec has been always gentlate with the Inuit and in the 1950s for stable to be our sound, we have inhit in colonies.
The grandfather of this man refused to go to the way.
The family I get for her life, he took all the arms, and all of its attention to the arms.
You have to know that Inuit doesn't temes the freedom, they exploited.
The slittles were made of weight in the weight of fishing in the skin in in caribs.
The grandfather of this man didn't have been intimit or night or the basis that suffering.
It's sunchariled, you know, pantalons in a pantalons of focused in and defected in its hand. When I did the 10 are congelate, he was working creating a lam.
He sprawed on the point of this slumn and when it was solid and when they were solid, killed a son.
He sushed the dog and created a brille, with the glass of the toracic has created a slittle, and it has gone on the other gun, and it has disappeared on the guns.
We want to talk about horse with now? [Risthe] And this way, in different ways, Applausian is the symboll of the Inuit and all the Indian population and all the Indian popular world.
In the aprise 1999 government has been rejected to Inuit in Inuit to Inuit in a total area of an area of land California and Texas I put together.
It's their new pathria. It's called Nunavut.
It's a independent territory of all the mineraries.
And I love this is a nation-state can recognize with his people.
And finally, I think it's pretty obvious about who of us was in these remote areas of the planet, I realize that they are not remote that are not not remote to the same time.
For someone is home.
They representing sections of humans that are rising to the temples. And for us all of these children, like the swimming of the hope.
To ended up to the National Geographic we are convinced that political will never come to nothing.
We believe that polempowered polemicy --
[Applausious is not persuasive, but we believe stories can change the world, and maybe we are the best institution, to tell stories of the world. Every month, and we can have 35 million visites.
156 Paesis they transmitted our television canal.
Our magazes are reading from millions of people.
Our work is traveling in ethnospher's going to bring our public in places. And that will go out and the way that they have been on how they have seen and the central revealing of the antiboard of antiboard, and we need to find a style in diversity, and we need to find a stype of life in a plural world, and we need to find a plurate style in a plury of life in a plural world.
where the wisdom of all the people can contributing to our collective benefit of collective.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some things I have written in this book that I hope you have heard and I'll just say and I'll be able to despite some links, and it doesn't notast.
I would like to start with what I call "the official dog."
The official dog?
The official dogma official societies and the official official and official official official -- "If we want to multimately the benefit to be the benedogs.
The reason is is that you know, from a late, the fact that freedom is in itself a value, is pretty for humans.
On the other is that if we are free, each one of us can act for it to do everything that mass of our benefit and not no one that decided to be in the name of ourselves.
The way to massize, you know, freedom is to be multimately mous.
And the more choices people are free, and more and more and more and more and more and more than they benefit to be bad.
This is a reporting is so deeply in society that nobody would have dreams to put it in a doubt.
And it's also deeply rooted in our lives.
I'm going to show you some examples of what progress has reached possible.
This is my supermarket. It's not particularly big.
I lost a simple note on conditions.
In my supermarket there are 175 conditions, without contempts, without contempts, and the 12 balloons of extract olive and the 12 whales that you can buy a huge number of conditional conditional number of constance that no one of the 175 reads have a huge degrades.
Here's what the supermarket.
Then you go to the electronic store, you know, CD, radio, CD, radio, radio, radio, plast, radio, plast, and the lap.
And in this single store, you have a great audio components, there's a big audio components.
We can make six million and a half a few different combinations using the components that there are in one negotis.
You have to put that there is so many choices.
Other camp: the world of communications.
And one time, when I was a kid, you could get all the wish, and they could get all the mom of mamma Bell.
It was known the phone is not the bought it.
And one consequence of that, in the way, it was that the phone is that the phone is not a stop.
These times,
Now we have a lot of variety of telephone of the phone cell phone of the cellular phone --
Here's the future.
My favorite is that in the middle of MP3, cut of the hidden and hidden Brype.
If you don't have seen it in the case, you're all in the case, you're pretty well certain that will be going to get there.
And what is the end of the things happening in the snow and it does this question and it looks like the answer? The answer is "No."
It's not possible to buy a phone that doesn't do too many things.
So in other aspects of life that are much more important than the waters of choices.
Life is not going on on on the United States that you go from doctor, and the doctor, and the doctor, you have to do.
Instead, you went from the doctor, and the doctor, "You can do A, or B" "You have these benefits and said, "B" has these skills and these risks. What do you want to do that?"
And he says, "Dotor, what would I have to do that?"
And the doctor says, "At these benefit these benefits and Bs have these benefits and By benefit and these risk."
"What do you want to do that?"
And you know, "Dr. if she was like, what do you do to do that?"
And the doctor, "But I'm not lei."
And we call the malato's "malat" authonomy that it looks like that.
But it actually isn't that one to move the fish, and the responsibility of decisions by somebody who knows something, or something, or somewhere else knows something, and almost certainly it's not -- and so not in conditional conditions.
There is a huge marketing of drugs, directed to people like me and you know, if you think that if you think not any sense, because we can't buy it.
But if we can't buy them, why do you do it because you can you buy them them, why do you don't we buy them them, because you don't we can buy them, because you don't we can buy them them, why do you don't we buy them them, because you don't we can buy them them, because you don't we buy them them,
The answer is that they want to do that domultimately to ask ourselves to change the receptor to ask ourselves.
Something so fundamental as is our orders that we will never be a choice, as you see in this vign, "We don't want to force, "We don't want to force the right time. We don't want to get a identity."
And we can reinventing how many times we get us to aggrade us
And that means that every morning, you have to decide that kind of person want to be able to be.
And it was in the family and the mathematics, a time perspective, uncement almost anyway, it was that he was going to be able to be able to do the most premious possible for the most premious possible.
The only one would choice was with chemistry, and not even what do you do later.
And the day, it's really going to play with.
I think of very smart students, and I do them 20 percent of work than a time.
And because they're not less diligent because they're less diligents.
But why I'm implement, I mean to ask ourselves, "should I have to smilk or no? I should I do do it right now.
"Would I sweet? I have to think before the kids or to care?"
I'm interrogatives of loving loving love.
And they try to answer these questions, even though this implement, even if this implement, and not get a good vote to my exame.
And they have to do that. I'm going to ask it.
Now, the job: We are lucky, like Carl underlym; technology allows us to work every day, from Hotel Randolph.
And you get parents, there's a corner, and I won't tell anyone where the WiFi works.
I don't say that, because I want to use it.
What does this mean this incredible freedom of choice that we have about work? Is it to continuously decided, and continuously at any time, if we need to work or not.
We can go to see our son play, with the cell phone in a pockets, Blackberry in the other, and the name, and the name.
And even if I'm all sent -- every minute we see our son to roll the headline, we are also asking, "Do I have to answer this call?"
"Do I have to answer this email? I have to email?"
And even when the answer is "no," this makes the experience of the title of your son son is a very different than what would be in other conditions.
So, we look at any part of we look like small and big, objects and stili and stils of life, is a matter of choices.
Once the world was this: Ovo, there were some opportunities to be a chance of choice.
The world today is this kind of like this: The dilemma is: "Is it a positive thing, or negative thing, or negative?
The answer is Scil is --
The positive lights we all know -- so I'm going to talk about the negatives of the negatives of the negatives of the negatives of the things that we all know -- so I'm going to talk about the negatives of the negatives of the negatives of the negatives of the negatives of the negatives of the negatiss
All this choice behaviors on two negatives of the people.
The first one, paradoxy, paradoxy, is that producing instead of freation.
With many options between the board, it gets very hard to do that.
I offer a meaning example -- a conducted on the planets of flights.
A connect my connection to the data of Vanguard, the giant society of pension, with about a million clients, with about a million clients, and so many miles in 2,000 companies.
What she found is that for every 10 solutions that are going to be offered in more, the percentage of airplane 24 percent.
With 50 sources are less than 10 percent of deaths than when you get them only 5. Why?
Because with 50 sources that you choose -- it's maledetail, and choice is remainly hard to decide and choice is remaintains.
And I wonder questions, and I said, "Yeah, of course, questions, and of course, the questions don't get it.
You know that doesn't just mean that these old workers from old people to eat because they won't have enough money to say that decision is so obsticle is so obstable that decision is so obstacle fundamental data.
Not participating them to 5000-dollar data, which would be well displaced to be slous.
So the paralysis is a consequence of having too many choices.
And I think it makes the world like this.
"And finally, for the ethry."
You would just like to make the right decision if it's for the eternity, right?
You don't want to choose the wrong fund to the wrong condition
So this is the first effect. The second is that even though we can avoid paralysis and make a choice, at the end of what we would be been with less options of how we would choose to what you choose to what you choose to the worth of which you choose to the paralyside.
And this for several reasons.
One of these is that with many conditions, and you know, if you buy one and you buy one and not perfect, it's easy to imagine you could make a different choice that would be better choice to be better choice that would be better than the alternative imagined us and the remultimately induced by the reflection of the choice, and the rempise of the choice, and the remulti-induced reping rewarddisfinger and the remit.
even when it was a good decision.
And the more choices are easy to make you so much as a detail, which is insodable to be insodable to be option.
And so so, there's what economists call it cost-cost-cost-opportunity.
Dan Gilbert has a very well stamattine as the value that we give things to the value of what we confrontier.
Del rest, when you have so many options as we can make the features, the features of alternative alternative and being less soddiscised and being less sophistated by the option that you have choice.
Here's an example. I have all the people who are not in New York.
But it's what you probably think you probably know.
There is this pacy to Hamptons.
A place of the luse.
Spipes splendid. It's all about them.
It doesn't send anything. But what he thinks is -- "Well, maledian Agoor."
"All my neighbors in Manhattan are alive."
"I could park right at home."
And he spent two weeks that is losing -- every day -- the chance of parking -- every day -- the chance of parking where you want.
The cost-in-opportunity is the satisfaction for what we have, even when the choice was excellent --
And more are the options that we have to look at more than we have to look at the cost of opportunity.
Here's another example.
This is a lot of things.
It talks about living the moment, and maybe live slow.
But the most important point is that you choice, you choose to not do the others.
The things that we don't choose have so many attractive attractive what we do.
Third points to be growing for waiting.
I tried to my skins and jeans.
And I just just just just jeans.
Once jeans were just a type, you buy and they were bought to be best, and they were sweeted a whole lot of times, they started a lot of times, they started to go good.
So I went to buy a couple of new when the old people had go, and said, "I've got to have a couple of jeans, this is my cut."
The committed me fit, relam fit, fit, fit, and you get it fit, relay?"
You want to the cernier or with the bottonies? "Stonehed" or "acid."
"Do you want rot?"
"Would you have a bunch or close them or close to the bla-to-a-h-bit.
I was sleep, and after a little bit of I could say, "I want the only one guy -- that was the only one guy, so I tried to all the people who was so now I tried to all the way from the negotis, and then I went out of the negotities, and I had ever been had, and I had ever had had had been able to do it.
It was the mmous. With all that I had the better.
But I felt worse.
Why? I wrote a book to understand it.
The reason I was worse is that I was that with all that choice was just my own expectations were perfective.
And I started just just just just a little bit of exceptional when it was only one of the time, but when it was 100 different cases, at least one guess was perfect.
What I had watched was good, but not perfect.
After I had paragonated to what I was looking at what I was looking at the expectancy.
The addition of options in life of people don't make it increased the expectations of the options of options itself.
And this will produce less soddisfation, even when the results are good for it.
No one in the marketing world if it makes it content.
Because if you know what I'm talking about.
The truth looks more like this.
"You were better when you were worse when you were worse to the time when you were worse to it was even worse was that when you were worse to evolve to meet the pleasure.
And the world we live -- the world we live -- opululationalized citizens with the perspective, the maximum that we can hope is that things are at the expectation of waitative expectations.
You never have been surprised because your expectations because your expectations, my expectations, you have ingigantite.
The secret of happiness -- what you're here -- that's "Basit" "Yes, you want."
I mean -- little authoric moment -- which are really sposited and my wife is really stums.
I couldn't do better, I didn't have to do better, I don't have to do better.
But you get to account is not always a good thing.
And finally, a consequence of buy a couple of jeans comfortable when you just have that jeans is that when you are not satisfacting, and you askk: Why?
"Who is responsibl?" The answer is clear.
The world is responsible. What would I do about this?
When there are hundreds of jeans, and you buy a insoddisface, and you ask you to you who is the responsible for you to be your responsible for you are you.
You could do better.
With hundreds of variety available variety of available variety of the success.
So when people get decisions, even if the result is valid, they hear and they feel insodage and they give it their own and they give it their own own itself.
In the last few years depression is exploded in industrialized world.
I think a significant factor -- not the unique -- but important -- of this wave of depression is that people have deludent because the standards are too als.
And when they have to explain this situation that the color is them.
So the final result is that we're in general, objectively, but we feel worse.
Let me tell you to remember you.
This is the official dog, what we all get for good and it's completely fail.
There is no doubt that a little choice is better than that you don't have to have any time but it doesn't really have a lot of choice is better than a pop bit.
There is a critical value value of it. I don't know what it is.
But I'm sure we have overcome from a piece of the piece of the level that the chote of our life.
Now, from political point of political view, I have almost finished -- from the time point of policy view.
What it allows all this choice in industrial society is the material.
There are many places in the world, and you know about the problem is that they have no lot of choices.
The problem is that they have too few deal.
So the faccenda I talk about is a malt malaria exclusis, rich of moderns, rich society in the Western society.
And what it makes you depress and angry is this: Steve Levitt you about how much those consticts and seats are ineat. It's a waste of money,
I mean that these choices, complicated and dispended dependous, it's not just that they are ineat.
I'm address.
They make worse worse.
If a little bit of what in our societies would have a lot of choice was reversed in the where people have too much more and it would not only be their life to improve and also the nostr.
This is what economists call a paretyan improvement paretian improvement.
A redistributed redition is good for all -- not only to the poor -- because of this choice in except that it would be too.
To wo wrap -- you can become all be what I wants --
You know, people in culture, thought, "But what does that do that fish?"
"It's obvious that you can't make anything in a glass of vet."
"A imagination of castry, a limited vision of the world."
and I did it at this time,
But then, I think about it, I am again that fishes the long long long time.
Because the reality of the reality of the reality of the mous, so that "everything is possible," you don't get freedom. You get freedom.
If you put the mouse to the satisfation.
You get the paralysis, and you get the benefit to the benefit to be good.
Everybody needs a sphere.
This is almost certainly too close to the fish, maybe even for the fish, and certainly for us.
But the absence of some symbolic symbolic sfathers, temption, for the rovine rovine.
Thank you very much.
