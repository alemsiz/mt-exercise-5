<unk> year I showed these <unk> for <unk> that the <unk> <unk> <unk>, which for almost three million years had the size of <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk> 40 percent.
So, this <unk> the <unk> of the problem because it doesn't <unk> the ice.
<unk> <unk> is, in a sense, the heart <unk> of global <unk>.
You're <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
The next <unk> is going to be a <unk> <unk> on the last 25 years.
<unk> <unk> are <unk> in red.
As you see, you're going to go to the blue <unk>.
That's the ice in <unk>, which <unk> <unk>.
You can see that the ice <unk> <unk>, of five years or more, it's like blood, which here <unk> from the body.
In 25 years is over so, so.
This is a problem because the <unk> are <unk> <unk> around the ocean, where there are huge amount of <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> from <unk>.
We're going to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, that <unk> could <unk>, <unk> this point of <unk>.
In some <unk> <unk> <unk> is already <unk> the <unk> is already <unk> from the water.
The <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in a <unk> team of a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>! <unk>: You're good. The question is if you <unk> it.
One reason is that this <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk>.
This is a river <unk> <unk>.
<unk> had never <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This is the river <unk>, in the <unk> of <unk>.
If you want to know how the level of the sea level of <unk>, here is where you're <unk> the sea.
These <unk> are <unk> <unk>.
<unk> other side of the planet: <unk>, the largest <unk> of ice ice.
The month, the last month, the <unk> of the ice is in <unk>, and that <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk>, is particularly <unk> in <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, like <unk> <unk>, like in <unk>.
<unk>, the <unk>, the <unk> <unk> of ice, you see new <unk>, which a few years ago, and a few years ago.
40 percent of the world population <unk> half of the world's <unk>.
<unk> <unk>: this <unk> is the source of the <unk> of this city.
<unk> is <unk>.
But when you <unk>, it's the same is going to <unk> water.
In California, <unk> <unk> is <unk> 40 percent.
<unk> are in the crisis.
<unk>, as you have read, they're <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> in the world in a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> are <unk> <unk> to a <unk> out of the normal and without <unk>.
<unk> times, in the last 30 years of the <unk> <unk>.
This is a <unk> of the <unk>.
If you look in the context of the <unk>, you can see the <unk>.
We have <unk> 70 million <unk> <unk> of <unk> CO2 CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million <unk> in the ocean every day.
Look at the area of the <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and on both <unk> <unk>, where there's a <unk> <unk> of the ocean <unk>, where there's a <unk> <unk> of the ocean.
The <unk> of global <unk>, together, <unk>, which is 20 percent, is the use of <unk>.
<unk> is a problem, and the <unk> is even even even.
The United States are one of the <unk> <unk>, together, together, in China.
And you're going to build a lot of other <unk>.
But we're <unk> to a <unk> of it.
These are the <unk> projects in the last years and some <unk> of <unk>.
So, in every way, there's a <unk> politics in our country.
The <unk> of <unk> and <unk> have <unk> million dollars in the last year for <unk> <unk>, which is a <unk>.
I <unk> this <unk> me something --
<unk>, in <unk>, where I live, there was a <unk> of <unk> billion <unk>.
Maybe you've seen it on the <unk>.
This is the <unk> <unk> <unk> in America.
It's happened around <unk>.
<unk> <unk> was this.
<unk>: <unk> the <unk> is a <unk>, and happy.
It's <unk> here in America, and it's <unk> our economy.
<unk> the <unk> is always <unk>.
It's good price, <unk> and <unk> <unk> it.
<unk>: <unk> is a lot of <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is <unk>. This is <unk>. This is his <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> <unk>: <unk> <unk> -- <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> -- they don't know what they're talking about.
<unk>: So <unk> for <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This is a one of them, a part.
<unk>: <unk>: <unk> <unk>, we see the changes as a <unk> <unk>.
So, in this <unk> is a great amount of money in a <unk> <unk> for <unk> and <unk> the truth on <unk>.
In fact, the <unk> is not <unk>.
We think it's <unk> -- it's also a good <unk>.
So we don't <unk> change.
We're going to do it.
<unk>: <unk>: <unk> <unk> -- you've heard a lot of.
So I <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> for how much <unk>.
<unk>! The cars are a little bit, but this is the sound of the technology of <unk>.
<unk> is <unk> <unk> is between the <unk> of global global <unk>, but the <unk> technology of <unk>, you see it changes everything.
<unk> a look: this is the <unk> technology of <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to the <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the national <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>: <unk> America is in the <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, the national <unk> crisis.
The <unk> that <unk> all of the <unk>, and the <unk> <unk>, like <unk> <unk> and oil <unk>.
Now, but, there's a new, <unk> solution to <unk>.
<unk> America: 100 percent of <unk>, in 10 years.
A <unk> <unk> America in work, <unk> more <unk>, and help <unk> the global <unk>.
<unk>, a solution that we're going to solve our problems.
<unk> America. <unk> more.
<unk>: This is the last.
<unk>: <unk>: It's <unk> energy in America.
One of the <unk> <unk>, we <unk> to <unk> the <unk> <unk> that we <unk> our planet.
<unk>: The future is here. <unk>, the sun, a new network network.
<unk> <unk>: <unk> for places.
<unk>: <unk> America. It's time to be <unk>.
<unk>: A old old <unk> <unk> says, "If you you want to go to <unk>, you go to go to the <unk>.
If you want to go, you go together. "
We have to go away, fast.
Thank you very much.
<unk> year, I did a <unk> on <unk>.
And I'm going to <unk> on how the machine it works.
So here. And for the ones that the other time there were not, the <unk> is the largest <unk> experiment ever -- <unk> kilometers of <unk>.
<unk> is <unk> the conditions that they were less than a <unk> of a second of the universe -- until we're going to <unk> millions of times a second.
All of that is just <unk>.
This is the car under <unk>.
We're going to <unk> these <unk> <unk>.
This is what I work. It's called <unk> -- it's <unk> <unk>.
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> in building so you can see the <unk>.
The 10 <unk> of the last year we <unk> the car for the first time.
And this picture was <unk> by <unk>.
It was because of <unk> <unk> in the room.
It's a picture of the first <unk> particles that he had done all around the <unk>, <unk> in <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> particles in the <unk>.
In other words, when you <unk> that picture the <unk> <unk>, <unk> the machine, which is a great <unk>.
I don't know if it was this <unk> to us more or this, when somebody on Google and <unk> that the page was this.
What we have a <unk> impact over over over to that.
<unk> a week later, there was a problem with the car, it had to be these <unk> here -- these <unk> <unk>.
These <unk> <unk> <unk> when the car works at the <unk> of <unk>.
Now, the <unk> between you <unk> <unk> and <unk>, "<unk>," It's not true. "
And instead they can do that because when they're very <unk> <unk> <unk>.
So, in less <unk>, at a <unk> temperature <unk> at that space between the stars, these <unk> can get that.
In one of the <unk> between the <unk> <unk> in <unk>, there was a <unk> of <unk>.
So the <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk>.
This was the result.
Now, this is more <unk> if you think that these <unk> <unk> <unk>, and you're <unk> about about 30 <unk>.
They're <unk> about 50 <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, what we did.
We <unk> them and <unk>.
Now, they're all of their <unk>.
<unk> the end of <unk> <unk> is going to be again.
We <unk> it, and we <unk> to get <unk> data to <unk> or <unk>, and we'll continue to figure out what the universe are.
Now, of course, in some way, these <unk> <unk> the <unk> of science and <unk> <unk>. It's easy to <unk>.
I think that's so hard, the fact that is that the <unk>, I think it's the value of things like <unk>.
I want to <unk> with the words of a <unk> <unk>, which, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, in <unk> <unk>, his <unk> was Michael <unk>, he said, "<unk>," <unk> <unk>, he said, "No," <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, and there are not <unk> in nature, and there are not <unk>, and <unk> <unk>,
Thank you.
I want to start <unk> to <unk> when, children, <unk> with <unk>.
As <unk> as <unk> and <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> actually thinking and <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> <unk> to the way we <unk> in the world around us.
So, from <unk> <unk> <unk> on our <unk> with <unk>, and I started <unk>, and I started <unk>, and I started <unk>, and I started <unk>, "And if we use a computer, instead of a computer, instead of <unk> <unk> as a <unk>, <unk> <unk> on a <unk>, and <unk> with a <unk>, with a <unk>, <unk> with a <unk>, and the <unk> <unk> <unk>,
and we go to our <unk>?
The question was so interesting that we <unk> to explore the answer, building the <unk>.
In a few words, a <unk> is a <unk> <unk> like a <unk>.
In a few words, a <unk> is a <unk> <unk> like a <unk>.
You can <unk> them with the hand, you can see them, and they have one screen and they have a radio <unk>.
But <unk>, they're <unk>, like <unk>, you can just <unk>.
<unk> are the <unk> example of a new <unk> of tools to <unk> the digital information.
And as as as as the <unk>, <unk> of the movement, of the other, and <unk>, and as as they're <unk>, <unk> <unk>, and as <unk> them, we can explore new and <unk> <unk>.
I'm going to <unk> with some simple example.
This <unk> is <unk> to show you, if you <unk> it into a direction, the video video <unk> so, if you get it into a direction, you go back.
These <unk> are <unk> of the other.
If you <unk> them, you're going to be around.
If they're <unk>, you can <unk> it and they can <unk> it.
If they're <unk>, you can <unk> it and they can <unk> it.
They also <unk> their <unk> and <unk>.
We've got to <unk> that one of the interesting <unk> of <unk> was the <unk> <unk>, for example, to <unk> <unk>, for example, as if it was a <unk>.
In this case, we have three <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> and I can <unk> to <unk> them.
and I can <unk> for <unk> color in the <unk>, where you're going to be.
If you're too, we can <unk> a little bit of a place.
I'm also going to be <unk> <unk>, as <unk>, <unk> and games, and games of <unk> where people can try things, and <unk> the results.
Now, I'm --
This is a <unk> <unk> that I do with a <unk> <unk>.
Here we have a game of words that's half of <unk> and <unk>.
<unk>, every <unk> <unk> a letter to a letter on every <unk>, <unk>, <unk> every <unk> <unk> a letter to <unk> a letter in case, and while I <unk> words he <unk> on a <unk>.
And then, after about 30 seconds, you have a new <unk> <unk> and new <unk> <unk>.
Thank you.
Here's here of the children in <unk> <unk>, I did that in a way that I <unk> them and I <unk> a video.
They're very much.
And one of the interesting things like this <unk> is that you don't have to give people a lot of <unk>.
I just say, "<unk> of words," and they know exactly what they do.
Here's here other people who are <unk>.
This is our <unk> <unk> more, there's the <unk> <unk>, there's right.
It actually wanted to <unk>.
They were just <unk>, for him.
Now, this is a <unk> of a <unk>.
You're going to build a tool for <unk>. He's <unk>.
It can <unk> new <unk> in the scene, <unk> their <unk>.
It can <unk> new <unk> in the scene, <unk> their <unk>.
Here's, it's doing it.
<unk>: The <unk> is <unk>.
David <unk>: Now he took a <unk> in the scene.
<unk>: <unk> <unk>.
<unk> work!
So we <unk> the <unk> and <unk> can <unk> the characters --
<unk>: <unk>!
-- I <unk> your story.
<unk>: <unk>!
<unk>: It's a story with the end, and you can decide him as you get.
<unk>: It's a story with the end, and you can decide him as you get.
<unk>: <unk>, <unk>.
<unk>: The last example I have the time to show you is a <unk>, <unk> <unk>, for <unk> and <unk> music.
It's a tool, <unk> <unk>, for <unk> and <unk> music.
The <unk> here is <unk> as a <unk>, <unk> and <unk>.
And so, you can <unk>, and you can have to <unk>.
You can also <unk> these <unk> in a <unk> <unk>.
And I just <unk> a sound <unk>. "And a <unk> sequence."
These are actually you can control from the live, as the <unk> and <unk>.
I'm going to <unk> it for a particular sound and then <unk> it.
And then there are the <unk> of time and <unk>, you know, you're going to <unk> the entire sequence.
<unk> like it works.
<unk>: <unk>: <unk> a <unk> in two <unk> <unk>. "<unk>, <unk> in a series, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
Now, you're going to <unk> a line.
<unk>: <unk>: Now, <unk> of <unk> --
<unk>: And now I'm going to <unk> the <unk>, so I can control the <unk> effect.
<unk>: I can <unk> the entire <unk> <unk> the entire <unk> time.
<unk>: And now we're going to <unk> the <unk> for <unk>.
<unk>: I'm going to <unk> the <unk> <unk>. "
So I don't have to <unk> before, but I can <unk>, <unk> more <unk>.
And now, I finally can <unk> the entire <unk> <unk> on the left <unk>. "
Thank you.
So, you can see, my passion is building new <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk> as well as our brain and body.
And today, I've got time to show you one of this <unk>, and some chance that we're going to get out of the lab.
So, the concept I want to <unk> is that's <unk> this new generation of <unk> objects, which <unk> information in our world in the way we want.
Thank you very much.
I can't see the <unk> now.
I'm a <unk>.
<unk> books is my <unk>, but it's more than this, of course.
It's also love and the <unk> of my life.
And I don't like that you can change.
But, I said this, something particular is happened in my life and in my career, and in my career, who <unk> me to <unk> the whole work with this work.
The particular thing is I <unk> wrote this book, this <unk> called "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, for some reason reason for some <unk> <unk> world and <unk> a great, <unk>, <unk>.
And the result is that everywhere, people <unk> me as if I was <unk>.
<unk> -- <unk>, <unk>!
I'm going to be all <unk> and say, "You don't think that you don't have any more to do better?
You don't fear of the life of the <unk>, and you can't be able to create a book that could <unk> someone? "
What can you get? "
It's <unk>, you know.
But it could go, part of what I remember, I remember, I remember, I was a <unk> -- I wanted to be a <unk>.
I'm going to <unk> the same <unk> <unk>.
And people said, "You don't know what what would you have?
You don't fear that the <unk> of <unk> you?
You don't fear of this <unk> for all of life without anything that nothing to be out and die on a <unk> of <unk> <unk>? "
So, you know.
The answer -- the <unk> answer to all these questions is: "Yes."
Well, I'm fear of all of the things.
I always <unk>.
And I also think of other things that people would not be <unk>.
As <unk> and other things.
But, for what I'm going to write what I thought and <unk> <unk> is why?
Is it <unk>?
It's <unk> that anybody who who who <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> for a job that I was <unk> for.
But what is that there is so particular in <unk> <unk> <unk> about health <unk> about health <unk> in a way that other <unk> don't do?
How I was my father, for example, he was a <unk> <unk> and I didn't remember one time in his 40 years of activity that they asked if they were <unk> to be <unk>?
There was never -- that's ever -- that <unk> of John, how do you?
<unk>'t <unk> that, <unk>?
<unk>, the engineers like the <unk>, as the <unk>, <unk> the <unk> of being <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We <unk>, we have enough this <unk>, and not only <unk>, but <unk> of every kind of <unk>, we have this <unk> of being <unk> <unk>.
And I don't <unk> else that look at the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that, only in <unk> century, <unk> young and often often for their own.
And the ones that you don't have <unk> to be <unk> by their <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, first of <unk>, in the last <unk> said, "Every book, I <unk> my book has a little more" <unk> about the work of your life.
But I don't <unk> when you <unk> it, because we heard these things so long that we've got a lot of <unk> and <unk> the <unk> that <unk> and <unk> are in some way, and <unk> are in some way, and the art, at the art, finally, <unk>, <unk>.
And the question I want to <unk> to all here here is, you're <unk> with this idea?
You're going to tell you this thing -- because it also <unk> from a <unk> distance to me not that <unk>.
I think it's <unk>.
And I think it's also <unk> and I don't want to <unk> <unk> in the next century.
I think it's better <unk> our great <unk> <unk> <unk> to live.
And I know, in my <unk> -- in my situation -- in the situation -- it would be very <unk> to start <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in which I'm in my career.
<unk> -- look at, I'm a young, I have about 40 years.
I still have about four <unk> of work in me.
And it's very <unk> that any <unk> of what we're going to be <unk> from the world as the work that I was going to be <unk> in my last <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, because we're all more or less friends here -- it's <unk> that my <unk> is to my <unk>.
Oh, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>,
You know this is the kind of thinking that door a person to start <unk> to <unk> the nine morning and I don't want to do it.
I'm going to continue to do this work that I love.
So, the question becomes, how?
And so, so I'm going to be, after many <unk>, which the way to work to write is to create a <unk> <unk> <unk>, OK?
I have to have to find a distance of <unk> between me, which I'm <unk>, and my natural <unk> on what wrote to get to get. And as we're going to get to look at the time, looking at the time, looking at the <unk>, looking looking at at the <unk> of the best ideas and <unk>.
about how to help people <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity.
And that research me to <unk> <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> because you go back and then <unk> back.
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> -- people don't believe that the <unk> creativity, OK?
You know, the creativity was this <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> to men, and <unk> the men from some <unk> and <unk>, for <unk>, for <unk> and <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> these <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity. "
<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> of you have a <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> were the same idea, but <unk> that species of the spirit of the body without a <unk>.
The <unk> is <unk>, because the <unk> didn't really <unk> that a <unk> was somebody particularly.
I think that a <unk> was this kind of <unk> <unk> that <unk> literally literally in the <unk> of a artist, a little bit like <unk> <unk>, and <unk> out of <unk> the <unk> of <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk>.
<unk> <unk> here is, the distance of what I'm going to talk -- that <unk> you from the results that you're going to be <unk> you from the results of your work.
And all I thought that was so that you know, right?
So, the artists were <unk> by <unk> things, like for example, like, right?
If your work was <unk> not <unk> all the <unk>, all <unk> that <unk> was <unk> by this <unk> <unk>.
If your work, you didn't have all of your <unk>, right?
All of it was your <unk> to be a <unk>.
And so people <unk> <unk> the creativity in <unk> for a long time.
And then the <unk> <unk> and all <unk>, and <unk> this great idea, and we put the human idea of the universe, and the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk>, and you're going to be <unk> by <unk>.
This was the principle of <unk> and people <unk> to think that the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk>.
And for the first time in the story, you're going to <unk> this or that artist as a <unk> <unk>.
And I have to <unk>, I think that was a big <unk>.
I think I'm going to <unk> someone, a simple person to believe that they're like a <unk>, <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> is a <unk> responsibility.
It's like you to ask someone of the sun.
<unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> all of these <unk> <unk>.
And I think it's been this pressure to have <unk> the artists in <unk> 500 years.
And, if that's true, and I think that is, the question is, and now?
Can we do that?
You go back to a more <unk> of the relationship between human and <unk>.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we can't <unk> 500 years of thinking in a <unk> <unk> in a talk about 18 minutes.
And there's people in public <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of <unk>, <unk>, you do that <unk> people <unk> <unk> to <unk>.
You probably don't <unk> you all about this.
But the question I'd like to <unk> is -- why don't?
Why don't you go to this way?
Because it's more sense of every other thing that you've heard of the <unk> <unk> process.
One process that, as anyone who ever ever <unk> to do something -- so, basically, you know, you know, you know, you know, you don't <unk>.
And, in fact, it can <unk>.
I did this <unk> with the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, who has now 90 years, but that was a <unk> for all life and said that during the life and said that during his <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk>, and he <unk> it, in the <unk> <unk>, and <unk> it, if you <unk> the <unk> <unk>.
He said that it was like a <unk> <unk>.
And that <unk> <unk> up up to her from <unk>.
I <unk> it, because he was <unk> the earth under her feet.
I'm going to have one thing to do that, and it was, words, "<unk> as a <unk>."
And so I went to home and it was <unk> by this <unk>, and it would not have to get another that a piece of paper and a <unk> enough <unk>, as the <unk>, as the <unk>, and <unk> on the page.
<unk> times times, you don't have enough, so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> without you can get to go to the home and she would <unk> it to <unk> through the <unk>, and she would <unk> to <unk> through the <unk>, and he would be <unk> to <unk> through the <unk>, and he would be <unk>. "
And then there were the time -- this piece of never -- there were the moments of the times that the was almost <unk>, OK?
So, he was <unk> at home and he was trying to <unk> and the <unk> <unk> through, and <unk> a <unk> in the while that was <unk>, and he said, and he was that as if you <unk> with the other hand and <unk>.
<unk> the <unk> from the tail and the <unk> in her body and <unk> on the page.
And in these cases, the <unk> would be <unk> on the <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, but on the last word to the first.
So when I <unk> it -- it's exactly <unk> to my <unk> process.
Not all my <unk> process -- I'm not a <unk>!
I'm a <unk>, and my way of <unk> is; I'm <unk> at the same <unk> every day and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> on the <unk>.
But even I was, in my <unk>, I <unk> against that, sometimes.
And I'm going to say that many of you <unk>.
You know, even if the work and ideas I <unk> me from a certain source, I can't <unk> <unk>.
And what is that?
And how can we <unk> it to it in a way of it, but, rather, rather, that you do <unk>?
For how I'm about, the best example I have is the <unk> <unk> <unk>, which I <unk> <unk>, which I <unk> different years ago for a <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
But then I <unk>, you <unk>, and a day while he was <unk> on a <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> everything for him.
I'm going to <unk> and all of a <unk> <unk> this little <unk> of <unk>, which comes into his head as <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, you know, it's wonderful, and the <unk>, but not not how <unk>.
It's not a piece of paper, it has no <unk>, it has no <unk>.
So, I start feel this kind of old <unk> <unk> in him in him, "I'm going to <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk> from this song.
I'm not enough, and I can't <unk>. "
And instead of go into the <unk>, you go.
<unk> the entire process and he did something completely new.
<unk> just the <unk> and said, "<unk>, you don't see that I'm <unk>?"
"You want you to write a song now?
If you really want to <unk>, you're going to <unk> it in a more <unk> when I can <unk> care of you.
<unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>.
I'm going to <unk> <unk>. "
And the process <unk> <unk> after this.
Not the work, the work was still <unk> as always.
But the process, and the <unk> <unk> that was <unk> when <unk> the <unk>, the <unk> that was <unk> when the <unk>, the <unk> that's <unk>, and I would <unk> it back to where it was, and <unk> <unk>.
But I'm going to <unk> this <unk> <unk> a conversation between <unk> and this <unk> thing and <unk> that <unk> and <unk> that they didn't <unk>.
So as as I <unk> that story to change a little bit of a little bit of <unk>, and I've already <unk> me.
This idea, I was <unk>, when I was <unk>, "<unk>," and <unk> in one of those <unk> <unk> in which we're working on something and we're going to think that's going to be a <unk>, and you can think that's going to be a <unk>.
Not just <unk>, just the <unk> book.
And I'm going to think of <unk> this project.
But then I <unk> me that <unk> in the air and <unk>.
So I <unk> my face on the <unk> and <unk> my <unk> <unk> and <unk> my <unk> to a <unk> <unk> of the room.
And I said to <unk>, "<unk>, what is, both we know that if this book is not going to be <unk>.
Because you see me, I'm <unk> all I have, I don't have more than that.
So if you want you to do it and do your part of it.
OK. But if you don't do it, you know, you don't have to be <unk>.
I'm going to write the same because it's my work.
And I'd like to say that I was <unk> that I'm going to do my part of "because -- at the end is so, OK -- <unk> in <unk> Africa, the <unk> of the moon, <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And they were always <unk>, because the <unk> were <unk> and they were <unk>.
But every <unk>, <unk>, something <unk>, and one of these <unk> artists, actually <unk>.
And I know what I'm going to talk, because I know you've got to all, a <unk> point, a <unk> <unk>.
It was like if time you <unk>, and the <unk> <unk> through a kind of <unk> and he was not doing nothing different from <unk>, like <unk> <unk>, but all <unk>.
And it's all of a human.
But you get out of the <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> of <unk>.
And when this <unk>, the <unk> people who was, the <unk> with her name.
<unk> your hands and <unk> <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, God," God, "God,"
That's God, you know.
<unk> <unk> -- when the <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> this <unk> with them and <unk> <unk> this with them and <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and you can hear in <unk>.
In <unk>, when a artist has done something impossible and <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> -- a <unk> of God.
And it's why we need.
But, the problem comes the day after, for the <unk>, when you <unk> and <unk> that are the 11 of <unk> and <unk> <unk> of God, and <unk> God's <unk>.
It's just a <unk> with <unk>, and maybe you never <unk> more than <unk> to <unk>.
And maybe nobody <unk> the name of God still as <unk>, and what's going to do with the rest of his life?
It's hard.
This is one of the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
But maybe it has not to be so <unk> if you're going to be so <unk>, <unk>, which the <unk> <unk>, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
But I just <unk> you're <unk> data in <unk>, you have to <unk> from a <unk> source of this part of your life that you have to go to <unk>.
And, you know, if we think that we think of this way.
And so I started <unk>, and it's what I <unk> for different months during the <unk> of the book that I was going to be <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>,
And what I have to continue to <unk> when I feel that I'm going to go to <unk> when I feel.
You don't <unk>. You just <unk> your work.
You're going to <unk> for your part, any can be.
If your work is <unk>, <unk>.
If you <unk>, you're going to <unk> you <unk> <unk> some kind of <unk>, for one moment through your <unk>, then then you're going to go. "
<unk>, you do the same <unk>.
And you're <unk>. "You're going to you.
I think you and I think I'm going to <unk>.
"<unk>!" <unk>, you know, even for <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk>: <unk>!
As you've already talked about some of these projects on the human genome, on what we've been talking about and discovery of new <unk>.
Now we're <unk> a new way, we started <unk> the biology and now, we're going to <unk> in a new <unk> of biology, <unk> and <unk> life.
We always tried to <unk> <unk>.
"<unk> is the life?" It's something that many <unk> have <unk> to understand different levels.
We tried different <unk>, <unk> to <unk>.
We're <unk> from almost 20 years.
When we <unk> the human genome <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of biology in the digital world.
Now, we <unk> life, or create new life, or create new life from this digital universe?
This is the map of a little <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, which is the <unk> species from the <unk> genome between those who can <unk> in the lab.
And we tried to <unk> the genome for <unk> a <unk> <unk>.
We're able to <unk> a <unk> of the about about 500 <unk>, there are.
But when we're a look at its map, it's <unk> <unk>, it's <unk> <unk> to our.
<unk>, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can <unk>, one time, it's very <unk> that this can get a <unk> cell cell.
So I <unk> that the only <unk> for <unk> was <unk> this <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And so we started the <unk> of the "<unk> we can <unk> a <unk>?"
Can you make the <unk> chemistry of these great molecules that we never have to create before we've never been doing before.
And, in case, we can make a <unk>?
A <unk> is just a piece of <unk> material.
The speed with which we're able to <unk> life is <unk> <unk>.
Our ability to write the code, instead, instead, <unk>, but it's <unk>.
And our <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We <unk> more than 15 years ago.
The process has <unk> a lot of <unk>, <unk> with a <unk> <unk> <unk> before <unk>.
But we've discovered that <unk> DNA is very hard.
There are <unk> of thousands of cars in the world that <unk> little <unk> of DNA, and it's a <unk> process: the <unk> <unk> is the <unk> <unk>, the <unk> is <unk>, <unk> <unk>, there are.
We had to develop a new <unk> for <unk> these <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
And this was our first <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's a little <unk> that <unk> bacteria.
We've <unk> the <unk>, <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> a <unk> of DNA.
The interesting part is when we took this piece of <unk> material <unk> and we <unk> it in the bacteria, the bacteria have <unk> to read this code and <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> particles are <unk> from cells, they're <unk> by cells, they're <unk> <unk>.
I talked about about the <unk> <unk> <unk> that they have <unk> this model.
They have more than you.
So, I think this is a situation where the software can actually build its same <unk> in a <unk> system.
But I'm going to do things in the <unk>.
We're going to build the whole <unk> of <unk>.
They're more than <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
So we thought of <unk> in the size of the <unk>, so that we can change the <unk> to understand what the <unk> of a <unk> cell cell.
<unk> is <unk>, and if you <unk> information in a computer, these are to be very <unk>.
When I <unk> this genome for the first time in <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> was a <unk> for every 10 <unk> <unk>.
We've discovered, <unk>, 30 <unk>. If you used that original <unk> <unk> <unk> that original <unk> <unk> never have to do that.
One part of the process is design <unk> 50 <unk> that <unk> <unk> with all of the other <unk> of 50 to build more <unk> that <unk> together.
<unk> elements here.
You've probably got to read that there's <unk>.
So, we have a <unk> code on four <unk>: <unk>, <unk> and <unk>.
And I'm going to <unk> together about 20 <unk>, and there's a <unk> order to <unk> every <unk>.
So we can use the code for write words, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
What we've done at the beginning is <unk>.
Some of the <unk> that they were <unk> from the fact that it was not <unk>.
We've <unk> these <unk> for <unk> just <unk> with <unk>.
There are <unk> that we <unk> them and <unk> them.
And we started <unk> <unk> <unk>. <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> with <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> in a way of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
So, in every step, we've got these <unk> in <unk> so we're <unk> to create a extremely <unk> <unk> <unk> as you're going to see in a minute.
We're trying to <unk> the process.
So, this seems the <unk> of a <unk>.
When you're going to <unk> these <unk>, more than 100 <unk> <unk>, you don't get <unk> <unk> in <unk>.
It comes to the <unk> of <unk> biology.
So we <unk> other <unk>.
And I <unk> another <unk> called <unk> <unk>, which in biology <unk>, in biology, you can <unk> the <unk>.
Here's a example.
This <unk>, called <unk> <unk>, can <unk> three million <unk>.
You can see in the <unk> as his <unk> is <unk>.
In 12 -- 24 hours is <unk> exactly as it was before.
<unk> thousands of organisms that they're able to do that.
These organisms can <unk> completely <unk>.
We live in <unk>.
They're absolutely sure that life <unk> in space, and you <unk> to find new <unk> <unk>.
In fact, <unk> has shown that this is.
This is a picture of <unk> we've built using these <unk>, just using the <unk> <unk> with <unk> design of <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> them <unk>.
This picture was not <unk> with a <unk> <unk>, but with a <unk> <unk>.
It's a <unk> so big that we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk>.
These are pictures that <unk> a period of about six seconds.
This is the <unk> we've done a long time ago.
They're more than <unk> <unk> code.
It's the <unk> of a <unk> structure of a <unk> structure.
It has a <unk> weight to 300 million.
If you <unk> it with a <unk> 10, you're going to <unk> this code.
Now, how do we do it? How can we do it?
Of course, through a virus is a game.
It's a little bit more <unk> when you use of bacteria.
It's <unk>, even when it's about cells as our: you can just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> another, which is <unk> the process of <unk>.
In <unk> <unk> the <unk> is instead of <unk> in the cell, but we <unk> <unk> that we're able to do a <unk> <unk> of a <unk> cell from a <unk> cell to another and <unk>.
We <unk> a <unk> <unk> from a kind of a <unk>.
<unk> are the two different as the men from <unk>.
We <unk> some <unk> in more way that you can have to decide what you want to do for this <unk>.
And it has <unk> with the <unk> <unk>.
And when we put it in the cell was <unk> and <unk> our <unk> <unk>.
And I'm going to <unk> that you don't go beyond, but we tried to <unk> more in there.
This is one of the <unk> of evolution.
We've discovered that <unk> species have <unk> a second or a third <unk> <unk> in a second thousands of new <unk> <unk> in that species.
So who think about evolution as a only <unk> at the time you have <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> DNA.
The <unk> that was in the cell cell not <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> we have <unk>.
It's <unk>, and it <unk> the other <unk> as <unk>, <unk> <unk>, and we're <unk> with only the cell and the new <unk>.
It has become blue <unk> because of the genes we have <unk>.
And in a short <unk> of time, all the <unk> of a kind of kind of like, you go to the whole new species, <unk> on the software that we <unk> into the cell cell cell.
And the <unk> are <unk>, <unk> are <unk>, and when you <unk> the code <unk> <unk>.
Now, this might be <unk> <unk>, but we <unk> the DNA, we can change things in a way.
Now, I've already <unk> that here you don't talk about <unk> -- but of a <unk> <unk> of <unk> -- and a half years of evolution, and I said that maybe we're going to create a new version of <unk> in which we're going to create a new <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Why do that?
I think it's enough, when we think of our <unk>.
We're going to go from six billion and a half of people in the next 40 years.
Right for give you a example: I was in <unk>.
Now there are three people on the planet for <unk>, in 40 years, there are going to be four.
We're <unk> problems now, <unk> and <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, and <unk> for six and a half of people.
I'm going to get it to do for nine billion.
<unk> more than five billion <unk>, more than 30 billion <unk>.
That's percent of <unk> a day.
When we're going to find <unk> <unk>, or any kind of process for <unk>, it will be a huge challenge.
We have to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of CO2 CO2 from these materials that <unk> in the atmosphere.
In the day of today, thank you <unk> <unk> in all the world, we have a <unk> with about 20 million genes, and I like to think that are the <unk> for the future.
The <unk> industry is just a <unk> about <unk>, and think of how many different things are <unk> out.
Our <unk> here are <unk> by reality, and our imagination.
Now we have <unk>, thank you to these <unk> <unk> <unk>, and I can create what we call <unk> <unk>.
We're able to build a big robot that can make a million <unk> a day.
Think of <unk> these 20 million genes or <unk>, and try to <unk> the <unk> to make <unk> or <unk>, new <unk>, we can change, because we can change, with a little <unk> <unk> biology now now in the last 20 years of science.
And it's just a <unk> <unk>.
We can have to <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This is a <unk> of some software <unk> that we're working on to be able to <unk> and design species to the computer.
Well, we don't know how they're going to be.
We know exactly what their <unk> code.
Now we're <unk> on <unk> <unk> generation.
You've seen that <unk> <unk> from <unk> was a <unk> experiment.
We <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> generation that we're going to be <unk> as as the <unk> <unk> or different kinds of <unk>.
But the only way we have a huge impact without <unk> the cost of <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the <unk> would be <unk> the CO2 in the matter that we're working for our cells that we're working for the first <unk> of <unk> that we're working in the first generation of <unk>.
<unk> light <unk> <unk> <unk> is a <unk>, but in our <unk> in the <unk>, we've found different <unk>.
This is a <unk> that we <unk> in <unk>.
<unk> in the ocean, at about <unk> feet of <unk> <unk>.
<unk> from the CO2 CO2 using <unk> <unk> as <unk>.
We're trying to understand if we can <unk> the CO2 CO2, which can be <unk> by <unk>, <unk> that CO2 in <unk>, to drive this process.
So, we think short we might be able to <unk> what the question of the <unk> <unk> "that's life" We have, "We have the <unk> <unk> <unk> the whole <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk>. If you can't do that from TED, where you can't?
It's a main source of energy.
<unk>, we're working on the same <unk> to create <unk>.
You've seen this year with flu, we're always going back to a dollar and with a dollar in less when you're going to find the right right right.
I think what you can change building <unk> <unk> in <unk>.
Here's how the future could start <unk>, <unk>, now, the tree <unk> evolution, <unk> evolution, <unk> evolution with <unk> bacteria, and finally <unk>.
We're so <unk> of the people.
Our purpose is to do in a way to live enough to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to <unk>. Thank you very much.
<unk>, I'm going to show you, the <unk> possible possible, some of the new technology we took to <unk> a <unk> <unk>.
It's a environment that you can <unk> is in local level that you can <unk> with a huge amount of data.
So we're seeing <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with a kind of <unk> <unk> and <unk>, for a <unk>, <unk>, <unk> the images as we want.
And it doesn't matter how much much of information that we see, how big are these <unk> of data, or <unk>.
Most of the <unk> pictures, but this for example is a <unk> <unk> from <unk> <unk>, and <unk> in the <unk> of <unk>, and <unk> in the <unk> of 300.
It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that <unk> the <unk> of a system like this is the number of <unk> on your screen in any moment. It's a lot of <unk>.
This is a whole book, example of data, not images.
This is <unk> <unk>. <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk>.
So, for <unk> that's just about <unk> and not images, we can do a thing, to see that it's a real <unk> of the <unk>, not a <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, not a picture.
It could be a little bit of <unk> for read a <unk> book.
I don't <unk> it.
This is a <unk> example. It's a number of <unk>.
Every picture is the beginning of a <unk>.
And it gives you a lot of the <unk> and the <unk> experience of a <unk>, or a <unk>, which is for nature a <unk>, which is for nature a <unk> kind of a half.
We also did something with the <unk> of this number in particular number of <unk>.
We've created a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> much more than that you use in a normal <unk> and we've <unk> in a normal <unk> and we have <unk> <unk> <unk>.
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk>, you can see here.
Or another <unk>, or even <unk> <unk>.
And this really <unk> some of these ideas for <unk> <unk> the <unk> of space.
So, I think this <unk> <unk>, and other <unk> <unk>, not <unk> to be <unk>.
Of course, the <unk> is one of the <unk> for this kind of technology.
And on this this is not going to <unk>, if you don't say we have <unk> <unk> to be in this field.
These are all the <unk> in the United States, a <unk> picture of NASA.
So now I'm going to do something else.
This is actually the live in the web, you can see.
It's a project called <unk>, which <unk> two different technologies.
One is <unk> and the other is a very interesting research in a very interesting <unk> <unk>, a student of Washington, with the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And it's <unk> in the web, <unk>.
You can <unk> when we do this kind of <unk>, where we can go from a picture, and we have this kind of experience to <unk>.
But the <unk> of images here has actually a meaning.
The <unk> of <unk> <unk> have <unk> these pictures, in the way that <unk> to <unk> places that <unk> all <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> are <unk>. So you see the <unk> <unk> <unk>. So you see the <unk> of a <unk> or <unk>, and these are all <unk> are all <unk>.
I don't know if I have time to show you some other environment.
There are some more <unk>.
I want to go to one of the <unk> data, and this <unk> <unk>, and this <unk> <unk> <unk> that we did work for the first time, to show you what we really <unk> is the key to show you what we really have to show you that we have to be <unk> the key to <unk> that we have in the website.
We had to <unk> <unk> and forth.
This is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> images of <unk> and <unk> and saying. <unk> <unk> of these <unk> and saying. <unk> <unk>. <unk> <unk> this model.
So, I'm all <unk> <unk> <unk> and they're all <unk> <unk> <unk> in this way.
And it's possible to <unk> this way.
You know, I would never have thought of <unk> to work for <unk>.
It's very <unk> <unk> this kind of <unk> here.
I think you see that's a lot of different kinds of <unk>: from those <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, a number of <unk>, <unk> together in this environment.
And if I can, I'm going to try to look at those <unk>.
A lot of <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
And then, in some part of the <unk> -- <unk>.
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We can go from <unk> to physics.
The point is that we can do things with the social environment. This is now <unk> data from the whole <unk> <unk> of how <unk> the earth, from the point of <unk> and <unk> all of the data.
And the <unk> <unk> together, more than the <unk>.
You have a model of the entire earth that <unk>.
Think of this as the <unk> of <unk> work on Earth.
It's something that <unk> in the hand that people <unk>, and the <unk> that you're going to <unk> with the use of.
They are <unk> with <unk> <unk> from other people.
If you're going to someone else is all these <unk> <unk> the name, my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and I can use it to <unk> in space, using that <unk>, using the <unk>, and I have a social experience.
Of course, a <unk> of all of this is <unk> <unk> of every part of the <unk> of the earth, <unk> not only by <unk> <unk> and <unk>, but by <unk> <unk>.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I realized? What do you know? What your software <unk> us to do is that in some point, in the next years, all the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk>: Yeah. What's doing in fact, it's doing it.
It's creating <unk>, if you want, between images.
And it's doing in the <unk> <unk>.
And the thing becomes very interesting if you think about <unk> information information that many of these <unk>.
As you get a research of images on the web, you <unk> a <unk> and the <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> of the picture.
Now, what happens if you look at all your picture?
So the amount of <unk> <unk> and the amount of <unk> that <unk> is really huge. It's a <unk> effect of the network.
CA: <unk>, it's really incredible. <unk>.
<unk>: I'm going to <unk> very much.
One of the <unk>, when you <unk> and one of the <unk> <unk> is the <unk> that we can live in the <unk>, and you have the past, in the <unk> <unk>, the past <unk>, <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> thinking that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and the <unk> <unk> <unk>, or <unk> <unk> are still <unk> <unk> <unk>, or in <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, to <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk>, to remember the <unk> <unk>, and the idea that the idea that the world we don't have a sense of <unk>, but it's a sense of a sense, but just a <unk> model. But it's <unk>, but it's <unk>,
the <unk> of a particular <unk> of choices that our <unk> has done, or <unk>, so many <unk>.
And, of course, all of the <unk> <unk>.
All <unk>. All <unk>.
We're <unk> <unk>.
We have to have to <unk> the death <unk>, so we don't have to <unk> and <unk> --
We all have a art.
What <unk> is the particular <unk> of the song, the <unk> of every culture.
<unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, or <unk> <unk> <unk>, or <unk> <unk> <unk>, or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, or <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, or a <unk> in the heart of <unk>.
He was my <unk> of a journey in <unk> a month ago, or a <unk> of <unk> in <unk> <unk>, on the <unk> <unk>, the <unk> mother of the world.
And all of these <unk> <unk> that there are other ways of <unk>, other ways of thinking, other ways of thinking, other ways of thinking, other ways of thinking, other ways of us to be in the world.
And, if you <unk> a second, it's a concept that you can give you hope.
<unk>, the <unk> of <unk> world create a <unk> of <unk> and <unk> that <unk> the planet and <unk> that <unk> the planet and <unk> <unk> that's important as the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And you can think of this <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and you can <unk> the <unk> of all the <unk> of all the <unk> of the <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>,
<unk> is the <unk> of humanity.
It's the <unk> of what we're and what we can be in how we can be as as <unk>.
And <unk> the <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is success, and <unk> much more <unk>.
<unk>, for example, <unk> that 50 percent of all the species was or it's in the <unk> of <unk>, because it's <unk>, or -- in the <unk> <unk> -- and you don't even even even even even even than <unk> -- and you don't even even even even even even even even even even even even <unk> in the <unk> <unk> -- that <unk> -- the <unk> <unk> <unk> -- that <unk> <unk> -- the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> --
The <unk> of all is, of course, the <unk> <unk>.
When you're <unk> <unk> <unk> on this planet.
One language is not just a <unk> or a series of a <unk> of rules.
One language is the <unk> of the human spirit.
It's the middle of the <unk> that the <unk> of every culture comes in the world.
Every language is a forest of the mind, a <unk>, a <unk> thought, a <unk> of <unk>.
And of those <unk> <unk>, as we're here in <unk>, at least half half half half of children.
They're not <unk> to children, the <unk> that means, in less than you don't have <unk> something, which are already death.
What's more <unk> of being <unk> from the <unk>, of being the last <unk>, you don't have a language, the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of <unk> the <unk> of <unk>?
This <unk> was <unk> of someone in some part of the world every two weeks: every two weeks: every two weeks: every two weeks: every two weeks, a <unk> language.
And I know that somebody of you <unk> "<unk>" <unk>. "It's not that?
The world would not be a better place if you <unk> all the same language? "<unk>, then we're going to all <unk>. <unk>.
<unk> <unk>.
<unk> a <unk> thing that means you can't talk about your language.
I'd like to show you a journey through the <unk> --
a little journey in the <unk> <unk> for you a <unk> of what we're <unk>.
Many of us <unk> that when I say "different ways of <unk>." I mean, "I mean," I mean, "I mean," different ways of <unk>.
<unk> for example, this <unk> <unk>, in <unk> <unk>, which <unk> <unk>, which <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's a <unk> that it's not able to <unk> the blue color, because the <unk> <unk> is <unk> in the <unk>, where the <unk> <unk>.
They have a <unk> language and a <unk> rule, <unk> <unk>, you have to <unk> a different language.
And all that has <unk> in the past <unk>, yet the <unk> is that in these families who are six or seven <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk>.
You're going to hear and then you're going to talk about.
I'm going to have one of the most interesting <unk> that I've been in, the <unk> of <unk>, a incredible <unk> that had the first <unk> in <unk>.
In <unk> five <unk> have <unk> a <unk> <unk>.
They've done from the top of the <unk> that <unk> <unk>, <unk> that this <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> had never seen anything of <unk>.
They <unk> the <unk> pictures from the earth, they <unk> to <unk> a form or a <unk> and, not <unk>, they have <unk> that <unk> <unk>, and they <unk> the five <unk> with <unk>.
But the <unk> don't just <unk> the <unk>.
They <unk> between them.
<unk> percent of the <unk> was <unk> by their own.
We're <unk> eight <unk> and we found two cases of death and when we <unk> for you know, they had one of them was so that they had a dead that he's dead, and then they <unk> it. And then they <unk> it. And then they <unk> it. And then they <unk> it.
The <unk> were able to recognize the animal <unk> from 40 <unk> and <unk> the species.
<unk> years, I was <unk> a very interesting task when my <unk> <unk> of my <unk> <unk> <unk>, if my <unk> <unk> <unk>, if I wanted to go to <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
For a sense of <unk>, I would have to understand the <unk> culture and the <unk> is not <unk>.
It's a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Very interesting.
If you <unk> the great <unk> of the world, what would you have to be <unk>?
<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>,
A continent comes out, thinking that Africa <unk> has not <unk>. And instead of Africa has not <unk>. And instead and <unk> is not else that the <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk>.
What makes interesting is the <unk> is the <unk> <unk> between life and death.
So the <unk> are <unk>.
<unk> can be <unk> from <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> way that for a little bit of <unk> the <unk>.
So, for this <unk> <unk> <unk>, you go to talk about God.
We <unk> in <unk> and <unk> God. "
And from the moment you're <unk>, is the spirit that you can <unk>, how can you have?
So you're going to <unk> these incredible events: <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a rather <unk> <unk> <unk> a very <unk> of the power of your mind when it's <unk> in a <unk> <unk>.
We all the <unk> with the <unk> that I've <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, in <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
In a continent of blood, this <unk> has never been <unk> by <unk>.
And I'm <unk> from a <unk>, but they <unk> <unk>.
The young young <unk> are <unk> from families in three or four, and live in a <unk> world of <unk> and <unk> in <unk> <unk> for 18 years.
Two years of nine years, I'm <unk> for <unk> nine months that <unk> in the <unk> of <unk>, now are <unk> in the <unk> of <unk>.
So, for all this time, they're <unk> to their <unk> and <unk> their <unk> and only only their <unk> and only their <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or to say the <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, they're <unk> <unk> and for the first time in their life, at age of 18 years, see a <unk>. And in that moment of the first <unk>, when the sun <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, all that they have learned in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, all that they have learned in all the <unk> <unk> <unk>. And the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
"<unk>? I'm going to tell you.
It's <unk>. Now it's going to be you. "
They call <unk> <unk> and they say we, <unk> <unk>, we're the <unk> of the world.
This level of <unk> is extremely important.
When we think of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and the old history of <unk>, which is a <unk> <unk> in its <unk> or maybe <unk> and say that these <unk> are <unk> to the Earth.
<unk> <unk> are not <unk> <unk> <unk>.
There is no space for these things in the <unk> <unk> or in <unk> <unk>, but because of time and <unk>, they've created a <unk> of the Earth <unk> not on the <unk> <unk>. But on a <unk> <unk>, but on a <unk> <unk>. And the <unk> idea that the Earth can be <unk> by the Earth because it's <unk>.
What does that mean?
I mean that a <unk> of <unk> <unk> that the mountain is a <unk> <unk> <unk> that the mountain is going to be a different <unk> and will have a different relationship with the mountain or that <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> a <unk> <unk> that a mountain of <unk> that a mountain is a <unk> <unk> <unk> that a mountain is a <unk> of <unk>.
That's a <unk> of a spirit, or a <unk> <unk> is <unk>.
What is interesting is the <unk> <unk> that <unk> the <unk> between <unk> and the natural world.
I grew up in the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> for being <unk>.
And that <unk> me a different human being <unk>.
If you look at <unk> that these <unk> can create different, <unk>, we start to understand some of their <unk> <unk>.
I <unk> this picture at <unk> <unk>.
Maybe some of you have heard about the <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
What makes the <unk> is not the potential of the <unk> <unk>, but its <unk>. It's <unk>. It's <unk> two <unk>.
And then, the side, this <unk> <unk> that <unk> a series of <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
<unk> the only <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This <unk> <unk> <unk>, very similar to <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
If you're going to see the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> that they do from a different <unk> of species, <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> that <unk> on the <unk> is a little bit like being <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a sea of electricity. <unk>'t make a <unk> of <unk>. It's actually <unk>. It's actually <unk>.
I <unk> with my <unk>, Richard <unk> <unk>, the man who <unk> was <unk>, with her discovery of <unk> <unk> in the <unk>.
My <unk> you can't <unk> these <unk> as you can't have to be <unk>. And you can't tell you to anybody to be <unk>. And they can't be <unk> because they can't be <unk> because they're <unk> by a <unk> that <unk> <unk>.
It's possible to <unk> <unk> only if you <unk> with other <unk> <unk> that <unk>.
Now, it's the <unk> that you're in this <unk> are <unk> of <unk>, the same kind of <unk> for <unk>. <unk> question: in a <unk> <unk> <unk>. <unk>: in a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, how they make these <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We use the great <unk> of <unk> and <unk>, which can <unk> <unk>.
But if you look at the <unk>, we're going to be <unk>. "
What does that mean?
This <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, which <unk> <unk> in the forest, and that our eyes <unk> in the same species.
If you <unk> their <unk> <unk> us, you know, they <unk> us, you don't know everything? "I said," No. "
The solution is: you get the <unk> <unk> in a night in a <unk>, and <unk> with a different <unk>.
And so you don't have to <unk>, but it's much more interesting than <unk> <unk>.
Now, I'm <unk> the problem is that even the ones of us who have to the heart <unk> <unk> are <unk>. But in some way to the <unk> of the history of the world than our world, and <unk> over.
In fact, the <unk> century, in 300 years, not <unk> for his <unk> or his <unk> <unk>, but rather like the <unk> was where we <unk> and <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the planet. Now the <unk> of the planet. Now the problem is not the planet.
So the <unk> are <unk> in a <unk> for new <unk> of life.
And the problem is not the technology.
<unk> <unk> have not <unk> to be <unk> when they put out of <unk> and <unk> as the <unk> have <unk>, and <unk> as <unk> have <unk>, and <unk>.
It's not the technology or technology that <unk> the <unk> of <unk>. It's the power.
The <unk> <unk>.
And if you look at the world, <unk> that these are not <unk> <unk>.
They're <unk> creatures and <unk> <unk> out of the <unk> forces that they go over their ability to <unk>.
<unk> that <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> --
a <unk> <unk>, in <unk> <unk>, a <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and now <unk> <unk> on the <unk> and <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of <unk>, where you can see the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk>, where the <unk> <unk>, <unk>, where the <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We're going to <unk> the <unk> with the forest.
Or, in the case of <unk>, are the <unk> <unk> discovery.
If you <unk> on the <unk> of <unk>, where I'm doing a lot of research, you'll see the <unk> <unk> of politics.
As <unk> <unk>, <unk> physics of a <unk>, is <unk> <unk>, but <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, but <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, not only is not just <unk>, but <unk> in certain <unk>, because it's part of the <unk>.
And you can't understand the <unk> of the <unk> until you don't have part of the beginning.
I've got the <unk> miles from <unk> in China through the <unk> <unk>, <unk> with a young <unk>, but just <unk> to <unk>, but just <unk> to <unk> what's behind.
<unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> million people <unk> from <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk>.
The father's father was <unk> to the <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> that means that it was <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk>.
<unk> <unk> is <unk> with <unk> <unk> in the <unk> that <unk> <unk> in <unk>.
My mother was <unk> and his <unk> was being <unk>.
It was <unk> of <unk> in <unk> age of two years, <unk> <unk> <unk>, because it couldn't have any of him.
The <unk>, who did the same, it was <unk> in <unk>.
A day has <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> and, for this <unk>, it was <unk> to the work for seven years.
<unk> <unk> can be <unk>, but the <unk> <unk> <unk> is by <unk> <unk>.
And then, it all <unk> to a choice.
<unk> live in the world of <unk> or we want to <unk> the world of the <unk> of diversity?
The great <unk> <unk>, before he said that its <unk> <unk>, before he was that, in our <unk> <unk>, not only <unk> the <unk> of the world, not only <unk> the whole <unk> of human imagination, but a day a day <unk> <unk> that they were.
And it's <unk> to remember that our species is <unk> for <unk>.
The <unk> <unk>, which has given us, which has been <unk> to <unk> <unk>, <unk> the <unk> of <unk>, <unk> the <unk> of <unk>, <unk> the <unk> of <unk>, creating <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, and we talk about <unk>.
The <unk> world has <unk> <unk>.
And so I don't <unk> me that we have the answers to all the challenges that we <unk> to get.
When you're going to do these <unk> of the world is asked what humans, <unk> with <unk> <unk>.
And it's in these answers that we all <unk> the chance of being what we're: a <unk> species, that we're a <unk> species, that all the <unk> and all the <unk> can <unk>. And there are great <unk>.
I <unk> this picture on the <unk> of <unk>, when I went to <unk> with <unk>, and this man, and this man, <unk> me the <unk> story of his <unk>.
The government <unk> is not always <unk> with the <unk> <unk> and in the <unk> <unk> and in the <unk> for 50, we <unk> them in <unk>.
The <unk> of this man <unk> <unk>.
The family, <unk> for his life, <unk> <unk> all of her <unk>, and all her <unk>.
You know that <unk> <unk> <unk>, you're not <unk> the <unk>,
The <unk> of <unk> were <unk> in the fish in <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> of this man didn't <unk> from the night or <unk> <unk>, or <unk> <unk>.
It's <unk>, you get the <unk> in your skin of <unk> and <unk> in your hand. When I did you get it, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk> of <unk> and when <unk> <unk>, he has <unk> a dog.
It <unk> the dog and created a <unk>, with <unk> <unk> created a <unk>, he has <unk> a <unk>, and it's <unk> on the <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> talk about <unk> with nothing? [<unk>. And that, in different ways, and in different ways, and all the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and all the <unk> <unk> of the world.
<unk> <unk> government <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> of a <unk> area of a <unk> area of <unk> <unk> and <unk> together.
It's their new <unk>. It's called <unk>.
It's a <unk>. <unk> all the <unk> resources.
One example of how a <unk> can <unk> with her <unk>.
And, I think it's pretty <unk> at least at least who we have been in these <unk> areas of the planet, <unk> that they're not <unk>.
For someone is home.
<unk> <unk> of human imagination that <unk> in the <unk> of the time. And for us, your <unk> of these children, as a dreams of our children, they become part of the hope.
For, we have <unk> that <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> never.
I think you know, the <unk> --
And they <unk>. They're not <unk>, but we think stories can change the world, and maybe we're the best to tell stories of the world. Every month our <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> our <unk> <unk>.
Our <unk> are <unk> by millions of people.
Our work is <unk> in <unk> for our public <unk> in places of <unk> <unk> from which <unk> <unk> from which <unk> and <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in diversity, and we need to find a <unk> <unk> in the <unk> and we have to find a <unk> <unk> <unk> in a <unk> world.
where the <unk> of all the <unk> can <unk> our <unk>.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some of the things I'm going to show you some <unk> of the <unk>, in case you've already heard of <unk>, in case, you don't get them.
I'd like to start with what I call "the <unk> <unk>."
The <unk> <unk> of what?
The <unk> <unk> of all the society <unk> <unk> <unk>: "If we want to <unk> the <unk> of our citizens" "" The way to do that is <unk> <unk>. "
The reason is, from one side, in fact that the freedom is in their own value, is <unk>, <unk>, <unk> for humans.
<unk> else is in fact that if we're <unk>, each of us to do everything that we're going to do everything that we <unk> our <unk>, without no one that we're going to be in our.
The way to <unk> the freedom is <unk>.
<unk> the <unk> people, more, they're <unk>, and more is their freedom, is the more than they.
This, <unk>, it's so <unk> <unk> in society that no one <unk> <unk> in <unk>.
And it's also <unk> <unk> in our lives.
I'm going to show you some examples of what the progress has made.
This is my <unk>. It's not particularly great.
I <unk> a simple <unk> on <unk> for <unk>.
In my <unk> there are <unk>, without <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and 12 <unk> you can buy a huge number of <unk> in <unk> <unk> that no one of <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Here's how the <unk>.
And then you go to the <unk> <unk> for a <unk>: <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
And in this single <unk> <unk>, there's a great number of <unk>.
We can make six million of different <unk> using the <unk> that there are in a just <unk>.
<unk> <unk> that there is <unk>.
<unk> <unk>: the world of <unk>.
Once, when I was a child, you could get all the <unk> services, <unk> who were <unk> by <unk> <unk>.
You <unk> the phone, you don't <unk> it.
One of that, between the other, was that the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
These times they went.
We have a <unk> almost <unk> <unk>, especially between the <unk>.
Here's the <unk>.
My <unk> is that in a half, <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> for <unk> <unk>.
If you have not <unk> you have seen in the <unk>, you're very certain that soon as well.
And what's going to end is that people <unk> <unk> in <unk> and it does this question. And you know, the answer is, you know, the answer is, "No."
It's not possible to buy a phone that doesn't <unk> things.
So, in other <unk> of life that are much more important than <unk>, you're going to be the same <unk> of choices.
<unk> <unk>: <unk>, you don't go to the United States you're going to be <unk> and <unk> you have to do.
Instead, <unk> from <unk>, and the <unk> says, "OK," OK, we could do it, or <unk> "<unk>" <unk> <unk>. "And these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. What would you want to do?"
You say, "<unk>, what do?"
And the <unk> says, "<unk> <unk> these <unk> and these <unk>, and <unk> <unk> these <unk> and <unk> these <unk> and <unk> these <unk>."
"What do you want to do?"
And you say, "Well, if she was me, what would you say?"
And the <unk>: "But I'm not she."
The result of the <unk> <unk>, "<unk>," <unk> that makes it look like a beautiful thing.
But it's actually not that a <unk> <unk> the weight and the responsibility to take from somebody who knows something, you know, <unk> the <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and almost of course, it's not <unk> -- and not <unk> to make decisions.
There's a huge <unk> of <unk>, <unk> people like me and you, you think of it has no sense, because you think of it has no sense,, because we can't <unk>.
But if we can't <unk>, why do we're going to <unk> them?
The answer is that they want to <unk> the <unk> for <unk>.
And so the fundamental one is the <unk> of the <unk> is a question of choice, as you see in this <unk>. "We don't want to <unk> the children. You don't have a <unk> <unk>.
And we can <unk> how many times we get us.
The that means that every <unk>, you have to decide that kind of person to be.
I'm going to go to the family and <unk>, a common perspective, <unk> almost for anyone, was that you get the <unk> as possible, and you could get to children.
The only real choice was with who, when, and even what I don't do after.
<unk>, all that is really to play.
They're going to be very smart, and they <unk> their 20 percent in less than a time.
And because they're not less <unk>, because they're not <unk>.
But why I'm <unk>, <unk> <unk>, "<unk>, or not? <unk>?"
"<unk> <unk> later? I have to think about the kids or to the career?"
They're <unk> <unk>.
And they're trying to answer these questions, even though this <unk> <unk>, and you don't get a <unk> <unk> to my <unk>.
And they have to do that. I'm questions.
Now, the work: we're <unk>, like <unk> <unk>, because technology allows us to work every day, every day, every day, <unk>, <unk> that we <unk> on the <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, there's a <unk>, and I don't say that nobody, where the <unk> works.
I don't tell you, because I want to use it.
What does, that mean, the incredible <unk> of choice we have about the work? It's we have to do, <unk> in every moment, if we have to work or not.
We can go to see our son to <unk>, with the phone in a <unk>, the <unk> in the other, and <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, on <unk>.
And even if they're all <unk>, every minute we see our son <unk>, we're also <unk>, "I have to answer this called"? "
"I have to <unk> this <unk>? I have to <unk> this letter?"
And when the answer is, it's "no, this makes the experience of your son very different conditions.
So, you look, things, little, little, and <unk>, and <unk>, life is a question of choices.
Once the world was this: <unk>, there were some chance, but it was not a question of choice.
The world of today I'm going to do this: <unk> is, "It's a <unk> thing, or <unk>?"
The answer is <unk>.
<unk> <unk> them all, so we all know, so I'm going to talk about the <unk>.
So, this <unk> choice two of the people.
The first, <unk>, is that <unk> <unk>.
With many <unk> of the <unk>, it becomes very hard to do that.
I'm going to give you a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
A <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> society, <unk> society <unk> <unk>, with a million <unk> <unk> in <unk> in different <unk>.
What she found is that for every 10 solutions that are <unk> in more, the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
With 50 <unk>, there's 10 percent in less than <unk> than <unk> when they're <unk> available. Why?
Because with 50 <unk> in which you have, and it <unk> <unk> to decide, and <unk> choice is <unk> to <unk>.
And in <unk>, and still <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and of course, <unk>, and of course, you never get.
<unk> that doesn't mean that these <unk> <unk> food for <unk> because they don't have enough money, you want to say that the decision is so <unk> that we also <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk>.
They're not <unk>, they're going to go to five <unk> <unk> year, which would be <unk> to <unk>.
So the <unk> is a <unk> of <unk> choices.
And I think that <unk> the world.
"And for the end, for <unk>: <unk>, <unk> or <unk>?"
You want to take the right decision, if it's going to be the right?
You don't want to <unk> the wrong, and you get the wrong <unk>.
So this is the first effect. The second is that even if we can <unk> <unk> and make a choice, at the end of how we have been <unk> with less <unk> <unk> of how they want to <unk> with less <unk> in the <unk> of what you want.
And that's a different reasons.
One of these is that with many <unk> of the <unk>, if you have one and not perfect, it's perfect, it's easy to imagine that they could make a different choice that would be better. And what happens is that the <unk> <unk> <unk> us to <unk> us to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and the <unk> <unk> <unk>,
And when it was a <unk> decision.
<unk>, there are, more choices is <unk> of any <unk> that is <unk> of <unk>.
<unk>, there is what the <unk> call <unk>.
Dan <unk> has <unk> very well as the value that we're going to do things from what we're going to be.
<unk>, when there are many <unk> <unk>, it's easy to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and be less <unk> of <unk> and be less <unk>.
So, here's a example. I'm going to <unk> with all of the <unk>.
But it's what you probably <unk>.
There is this <unk> to <unk>.
A place of <unk>.
<unk>. <unk> day. It's all of them.
It's not <unk>. But what he think is, "Well, <unk>, <unk> is <unk>."
"All my <unk> are <unk>."
"<unk> <unk>."
And it's two weeks from the idea that's <unk> -- every day -- the chance of <unk> where you want.
The <unk> <unk> for what we have, when the choice was <unk>.
And the <unk> are the <unk> we have from <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk> us to <unk>.
Here's another example.
This <unk> tells us a lot of things.
We're going to live the moment, and maybe we live.
But the most important is that you're <unk>, you're going to do the other.
The things that we don't have many <unk> that they can make less <unk> what we do.
<unk> <unk> <unk>.
I tried to my skin <unk> a new <unk>.
<unk> <unk>.
Once the <unk> were a kind of one of the <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, they were <unk>, just after <unk> <unk> a life and <unk> a lot of times, I would go to go.
So, I <unk> a couple of <unk>, when the <unk> were <unk>, and I said, "I need a couple of <unk>, this is my <unk>."
The <unk> said, "Do you want to <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>?"
Do you want to <unk> or with <unk>? "<unk> or <unk>?"
"" Do you want to <unk> them? "
"<unk> <unk>? <unk> <unk> or <unk>? <unk> <unk> --" <unk> <unk>.
I was <unk>, and after a little bit of I've been <unk> to say, "I want the only guy that was so for a idea of what it was so for a <unk> <unk>. And then I <unk> all <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, and then I had ever had.
It was the <unk>. With all that choice I had <unk> the better.
But I'm going to be <unk>.
Why? I wrote a whole book for <unk>.
And the reason I was, it's <unk> with all that choice my <unk> were <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
I had <unk> <unk>. I didn't have to <unk> me. I'm not going to be a kind of <unk>, but when I had to be a kind of <unk>.
And what I had <unk> was good, but not perfect.
And then I <unk> what I was <unk> with what I was <unk> in <unk>.
The <unk> of <unk> in life of people don't have <unk> the <unk> that these <unk> are <unk>.
And this <unk> less <unk>, even when the <unk> are good.
<unk> in the world of the <unk>, if you know.
Because if you <unk>, you don't know what I'm talking about.
The truth is <unk> more than this.
"It was better when you had to be worse," The reason that was better when you was <unk> was <unk> as as it was <unk> as <unk>.
<unk>, in the world we live -- <unk>, <unk> citizens with <unk> -- the <unk> that we can <unk> is that things are <unk> to the <unk>.
You never have <unk> <unk> because your <unk>, my <unk>, you're <unk>.
The <unk> of happiness -- what you're here -- it's: "<unk>" Yeah, you want it. "
I mean -- small moment, I'm really <unk> -- I'm really <unk> and my wife is really <unk>.
I couldn't have to do better, I'm not <unk>.
But <unk> is not always a <unk> thing.
<unk>, a <unk> of <unk> <unk> when there's just that kind of <unk> is that when you're not <unk>, and you're going to tell you? "
"Who is <unk>?" "" "<unk> is <unk>.
The world is the <unk>. What would you do?
When there are hundreds of <unk>, and you <unk> a <unk>, and you <unk> a <unk>, and you <unk> who is <unk>, you're <unk> that the <unk> you're.
I could do better.
With hundreds of <unk> available, there are not <unk> for <unk>.
So when people are doing decisions, even if the result is <unk>, you're <unk> and <unk> the <unk> to them.
In the last years, the <unk> is <unk> in the world.
I think that a <unk> <unk> -- not the only, but important -- of this <unk> <unk> is that people have <unk> experiences because the <unk> are too <unk>.
And when they have to <unk> this situation that <unk> is they think they're going to be <unk>.
So the end of the end is that we're better, <unk>, but we're going to be <unk>.
I'm going to show you.
This is the <unk> <unk>, what we all get for good and it's completely <unk>. It's not true.
There is no <unk> that a little bit of choice, but it's not <unk> that much choice is not <unk> that much choice is better than a little bit.
There's a value <unk>, <unk>. I don't know what it's.
But I'm sure we have <unk> from a piece of level of the level that the <unk> choices.
Now, from the point of <unk> -- I've been <unk> -- from the point of <unk>, <unk> is <unk>.
What allows you all this choice in society is the <unk> material.
There are many places in the world, and you have <unk> <unk>, where the problem is not they have <unk> choice.
The problem is that they have too <unk>.
So, the <unk> I'm talking about is a <unk> <unk> of <unk>, <unk> society.
And what it does <unk> and <unk> is this: <unk> <unk> you talked about about about how <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. It's a <unk> of money.
I mean that these choices, <unk> and <unk>, it's not just <unk>.
They're <unk> <unk>.
They make it worse.
If you have a little bit of what in our society allows <unk> choice to be <unk> in those people have too much of the people have too few <unk>, and it's also our.
This is what the <unk> call a <unk> <unk>.
A <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. We all -- not only in the poor people -- because of this choice in <unk> that we <unk> us.
So, to end, you can become all you want to --
<unk>, people, <unk>: <unk>: "But what would you do that fish?"
"It's <unk> that you can't make anything in a glass of glass."
"A <unk> <unk>, a <unk> <unk> <unk> --
and I <unk> it so, I <unk> this, at the beginning.
But then, <unk>, I realized that the fish knows that that fish is the long.
Because the reality of the <unk> is that if you <unk> in <unk>, in the way that you can't <unk> the <unk>.
If you <unk> the <unk> way that all <unk> possible possible to <unk> the <unk>.
<unk> the <unk>, and <unk> the <unk>.
They need a <unk>.
This is almost too <unk>, maybe even for the fish, and <unk> for us.
But the <unk> of some <unk> <unk> is a <unk> for <unk> and, <unk>, for <unk>.
Thank you.
