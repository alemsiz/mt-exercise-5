The year at TED TED TED photographs on the LHHHHHHH.
And they have to recovered to the machine.
So it was the other time to the other time time you don't have the other time time -- the most experiment scientific experiment scientific -- 27 skets -- 27 miles of conference.
And his become to recovered the conditions that were less than a billion second of a billion second.
And everything is simply to the environment.
This is the machined Gineveve.

This is what working on the ATALS -- is larlarlarge 44 meters and a half of 22 meters of 22 met.
This is a picture of ATATALATAs in building the ATAs in building the productions.
The 10 skets of the room of the first time for the first time.
And this picture was a batted by ATAS. S. S.
And it was to immense of the healthy in the health.
It's a picture of the first picture of the first particles of the HHCentrring in the HCentrrling in collision, with a part of the Hurspread and the Hundline and the rest of the He's dlevel and the rest of the HHHH.C.
In other words, when we demust be the 10 sket, we understand that the machine, we had the machine.
I was going to do that there was to do more opopening to the most opening on the Google and vide the pages that the page,
And he means that we had a cultural impact of the scientific of the scientific scientic did.
And it was a weeks at at the machine, there was a problem with the machine, these films here -- these films.
These files are 13,000 feet when the machines the machines of the powerful machine.
Now, the left of you have seeing and dealing and dirando." It's not too much too much much much in the mother."
And they can do it because when I have a very quickly become up with the sursurfaces of the surfaces.
So, 271 degrees, a perature of the space, these films in the space, these film, these films can get that corrup.
In a part of the most emizing the most emizing the magnets in the LH, was a found difectly rection.
So the films of the reality of the 13,000 feet and 13,000 feet of the electrics.
This was the result of it.
Now, this is still more impressions if you think that these magnets are more than 20 center and that are cross about 30 centimeters.
There's a given seefited about 50 magnets.
We had to get to realize, what we have done of it.
We have been realized and justics.
As are writing all of their place to their place to the place of the tool.
And the end of the end of the basic LHC will be new today.
I have to be able to be able to get out of the data of the data of the data and then we had to be so our avail, and so we had to be able to be the matter for the universe.
Now, of course, in a certain the model, these instituting the value of the goldebing of the engineering of the efood and the realy-re-re-hour.
I think that the fact that it is so difficult of the things like LHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHere's the fact that is this is this the values.
I want to concept with the words of a scientists of the English, the thing that I imagine, in the fact of the experiments of the experiments of the himperiments of the hyself is to the human behind of the human behavior, "Nish: Nigh, and the human mindds, which is that we have to the brain that the whole new ideas that we don't have that we have to be a new new new mind of the world."
Thank you.
I want to start to read you to realize that children to the children, to do a little battacks.
And he understand how they realized them and they take them and they take them and they would be able to think about resolve and resolving them to think about the problems and hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-resolving and resold them to think about the resolve problems.
The reasons is that connected to the way we understand that we understand the world of the world in now.

And then after about 30 second of the rest of the new set of a new set and new possible to be able to try to promise to it.
Thank you.
This is the children who happens in Middle Lab, I did in the Middle and I had to get a video.
They have a lot of a lot of a lot of it.
And one of the things that are interesting to the kind of the people who don't want to give you a lot of people who are doing in the people who are going to be able to the people in the other things that are not to dedate to the people to the people of this gence of this gence of this gence of this gence of this gence of this gence of this genies.
I only know what I said, "Well well what they are going to be what they are going to do it.
And this is the other people who are going to be it.
This is our bad, there is a more object of the bund-bades.
And it was just imple.
They only have a lot of the five of it.
Now, this is a carton a carton of a carton interactive interactive of a carton of a carton of a carton of a car.

DM: The last example of the last example of recently, I realized to recently, for recently, to exef, and exefit and exesic example,
It's a recently, recently, recently, to be recently, and exefing music.
The Some of the batteris like the batteri.
Or one of these four different different different different different different variation, and you can get to us.
And then inolds, these instituts in a sequency of the flopic of the floor.
And it modefication to be a very simply of a sequency and a sequency."
These are effects that you can live from the rever, as the rever.
And you have to a particular particular and then you get to the sket.
And then there are the effects as time and times that they applicplicated to intersequence.
Look like it.
Video: DM: You're going to put a little bit in two Sifttype of the system, the extremely extremely extremely other him, we found other hundred --
Now a balk-bades of balks.
Video: On the reasons of the rest of the rest of the face --
Video: M: And then put it the film, so I can control the batteri, so I can control the effect of the effect of the effect of the face.
Video: DM: I was quite quite the intersequency to the whole sequence,
Video: DM: And then he went to the film to the next next to the more expression.
Vii: I can rereduce the sequency of the sequence.
So I don't have to be the first first first of the first first time I can try to slight more than the long long long long as much more than the rest of the first time.
And then finally, I can set the intersequency of the strange of the stranger Stline the Sty."
Thank you.
So, as you can see my passion is build new interface in the machines more more like the brain and more like our brain and rected.
And I had time time to show you a time of the result of this person and also some possible that we would be able to be able to get out of the lab.
The conct conct that I want to get this new generation of objects of objects to interact with the media reduction of the media reduction in our world that we want to be able in our world that we want to be the way to the world that we want to be able to the new object of the new objects.
Thank you very much.
I can't see the time I know to talk about all of you.
There's a scrows on the chroom of the sket.
Some of the books is the basic of this, but it's more of this obviously.
It's also the amazing and the fasash.
And I don't expect that can change it.
But he said this is going to be happened in my life in my life in my life in my career and in my career in my carefully with this work.
The thing that particular thing I recently is this book, this book, the Mangia, Prula, Prula, Prule, the who's preclear of my precent and recently in the world and become a sense of the world and become sense, and a sense of the interest of the interest of the best thing is is that the best different constion.
And the result is that everybody from the hor, people who were like if they were going to connected as if they were condable.
Davavail, connection, connected.
They have to me all worry and says, "I don't have been a better than the country to do it more than you do that?
I don't have to continue to continue to writing all of life could be able to create a book that can create a book that can be able to somebody to somebody to somebody to somebody to be able to somebody to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to write to writing a book.
which can be to somebody to somebody el?"
It's rasicants, you know it.
But it could go to the time that I recognize that I was a few years ago, when I was a adolder, when I was a adolder.
I met in the same recorcording from the countries from the countries.
And people who says, "I don't have to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be happen?
I don't have the countries that the billion of the refis?
You don't have to be able to do this mestize the life that without of the bad of the myself on a mulo of mulo with the horbrother?"
And you know it.
The answer -- the answer is all these questions is, "Si."
Sight, I have a countries.
I had a countries.
And I also country to be a lot of other things that would be to ind.
As the other things that are shared and other things to be there.
Ma, for how I writing the writing what I was thinking about it.
Is it rection?
It's a little bit that that that they asked to be able to be able to be a work work of a work work to be a work to do for it.
But what is so particular in the impretty creative to be able to realize the health?
As my father was a tough was a tgineering and not recognize in the 40 years of a 40 years of the time that was asked to be asking the example, if you were able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a solve years of a solve month?
I don't know that that block of the authings John, how you know, how they do you know,
It didn't work?
Onnly, the engineers as wells not certain the covered of the reputation of the reputation of the reputation of the reputation of the resis.
We have to recovered this reputation, and not only only writers but creatic creatic creatic reputation of the reputation of the repution.
And not another that is that look at the tristand of the deads of the magnized creative -- but in the eximple, in the eximple, they were able to the horder to hor.
And that they don't know that they have been data to be really, they were discovered their women.
Norman Mailer, before the last first first of the first view of my book me me me me a little bit of a little bit of the work."
But we don't know when we feel when we heard these things that are very interested in some way we have a lot of the whole thing we have been interior, and the creative fact that creative creative creative to some people in some way of the arts, the conduct of the arts, the conduct of sciousness to the scientist.
And the question that I want to all the question is today is that you have to the ide?
It was the bad thing -- because it looks like a centimeter of a center of the rest of this supposed to the night for the same pox.
I think it's a diose.
And I think it's also a few hand-oil person to the next seem of the next seem of the next seey.
I think it better than the recorcording of the big creative creative creative creative creative creative creative creative creative face.
And I know that in my home -- in my home -- in my housing -- it would begin that if I was going to be a lot of housing the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the realition and in the house of the rest of the rest of the house.
On -- it look, but look like this, I'm very welling object -- I was about 40 years.
I have about four decades of work in the work in work in my work in the work of the work in the work of the work of four decar of the work in the four of the work of the work of the work in the work of the work of the work in the work in my work in work in the work in my work in the work in the work in the work in the work of the work in the work in the work in the work in the work in work.
And it's very probably that anything that I write in the world that write from the world as writing the world as walk in the last year, I was going to be the last book.
It was going to be a little bit more than we have a little bit more than the big time is the most successful than the big ball.
Oh, Ges!
You have this gence is the gence of a person, that he portunities to be able to begin in to the name of matter and I want to do it.
I would continue to do this work work that I work that I work that we know.
So the question the question of the question of the question,
And so I know that the basic of the way to work to work to work to be what to create a food of create a very crassic protextremely ctextremely reflective, right?
I was able to some way to be a distance of such that I'm writing in the natural of course, and my natural reation is going to get the population of the time to the time time to the models of the time to look at the time as you can start to look at the time to look at the other people, and I was going to be able to be able to be able to be the more ideas as as as as as as as as as as as as the most of the most of the time of the most of the most of the most of the other people,
how to help people creative creative gests to inresent the creative creativity.
And that research me to the Grecicia and Roma.
Seguitems because the game and then he went back and then back to the him.
In the ants Grerecient and Roma -- the people don't like to believe that creative creative creative demen from the manage, OK?
And it was thinking about the creative rest of the diving of the man who was to the man who was to the man and slowing people and spread to the resected.
The recreative demonstrate the rest of creative creative creative creative creative creative creative creative reals.
Someeas, I wonderful demone that was going to have a chargy, sage.
The Romans were the same idea, but they called the same kind of explain a genie.
The thing is is great because the Romans don't think that they were a geniiize of intelligen.
They have a genies that a genies of the bundata that created in the burpon of a little bit like the election of a little bit like the elfo as a little bit like the electric of the first time of the artist of the worst of the artist of the artist of the worst of the worst of the work.
And the result -- that is the result of the fact that couple of the psychological that produce produce that produce of the result of the work.
And all the worst that was that they working, right?
So the artists of the artists were protype of things, what?
If you do the work was a work of the work that would be able to be all the market, all of the market, all of the same time, they had to help it.
If your work work on the work of the work of the work of the work?
All ll of the genior that was your genior to be a hundred of it.
And so people concept concept the creative creative in Ocdent for time.
And then Rinasciate the way and all change, and they were all the idea, we put this great idea, we have the center of the universe and the mister of the universe and him, and you writing the way that writing that writing the detains that writing the way that writing the way from the universe that we write the universe that writing of the universe that big idea.
This was the principle of human eximent and people are begin and people to think that creative creative to think that creative from the istration of the istration of the human human beyond and the people who started to think that creative and we started to think that creative and we started thinking about the creative and I think that creative and we started thinking about the creative of the human human begin and and I was thinking about the ground.
And for the first time in the story, you know, he was going to this or that arguy is like a geniior a genium with the genie.
And I have to dively, I think that was a big sket.
I think about somebody to somebody -- a simple of creating creating as a recipient as the foundation of all the founds, the founds, creatiststery and consciouss, creatic and resibility is a movie movie to be a lot of human begin to human behind that human begin the human behind to be a big big big srapy.
It's like to somebody else to somebody else the solution of the solum of the solution of the solure.
Deform and depended the efform and create all these ingers expectly on the perforce.
And I think this was that was this was the artists in the country in the country in the countries in the fired.
And if this is true, and I think that the question, and I think the question?
Can we do it different?
Mans to a lot more antic commercial relationship between human relationship between the human creative of the relationship of the relationship of the relationship of the relationship of the relationship of the relationship of the relationship between the human relationship between human relationship between the relationship.
Or maybe it would be it.
Maybe we don't can cannot have to be about 500 years of 18 minutes in a 18 minutes.
And probably the public who is the public that soft would be a little bit of the notion on the notion of the notion of the notion of the notion of the fact that people are going to be happened in the fact that happens in the fact that they were going to be able to the project that they were going to be able to the reward the rectypppppited in the notion of the notion of the notion of the usustrong the notion of the notion of the notion of the notion
I don't know that that we don't know all about all this thing.
But the question that I want to look at the question that would you like to do it?
Why don't think about the mother?
Because it more sense of every other thing that they never heard to experiments to experiments of creative creative creative creative creative creative creative creative creative creative creative to the process of the process of the creative sense of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the creative creative creative creative creative creative creative creative to the process of
A process that is that they have never tented to do something -- so much -- so that it was here -- all -- all of the sunch of the inspired ition.
And in fact, you can see it looks like a lot of paranorm.
I did this institute with the extraordinary food with the same Ruth Ston, which was 90 years, but was a poet, which was a little bit of the first life for the first time, he was working in the Virg, and I was working in the wind of the countries -- when I was a countried countries.
I said that was like a ballon-further.
And he came to the countries to the countries.
I heard the way to the him, because he had to get the tremendous tremember of the building.
Sapen to have a thing to do to what point was did, and he was did, "Wit."
And it was going to get home and he was instep of this poesia, and they should be able to be a bund to a bunch of a broad and a broket, as the food and the price and the price and the price and the price and the price and the price.
Or I could not be enough to be enough to be enough and recorrecorree and recorrecorrecorre-housing housing the house and he had to get the countries to the countries and the patients, and he was continued to the other poet.
And then there were the time -- this piece of the same time -- there were never the time -- there were the time in the time that was almost perds, right?
So he was recorring home and he was trying to the career and the poess, and and he was skin the way in the bad was the time in the other him, and then he was a bad and the other hand-hand-house and the food, and then he was going to go to the other other house and the brother, and the other other house and and he was the wind and the walk up the other other handwind and and and and and then he was was going to go back to the walk in the other other other other other
He was the poescide of the couple of the couple of the hund and the rest of the price of the price of the price of the bad and the couple of the him.
And in these basis, the poespecially the price of the perfect and realized in the last last last time to the first first first time to the first first time.
So when I think the countries -- is exactly exactly the process of the creative creative creative creative process.
I don't have my process process -- I'm not a condutting -- I'm not a condututting the process of creativity.
I'm a mular phone, and my way to work in the same orary of the same orary day, and move to work and work and work and to try to get to the same time.
But they woul, in my head, I hope that thing, and I found that thing,
And I image of you that many of you have a done of you know,
You know, if I work and ideas and ideas and ideas I had to be a certain a certain a certain the ske.
And what is this thing?
And how we can relationship us to be able to be the head, so much of the head head to the head of the health?
And as I was looking at the better example of the last six of the music, Wits, Waths, the Waths, which I interviewing a day.
We had talking about this, and you know, Tom, and you know, Tom, for the major the carnation of the artist of the artist of the ards, in the arguy of the ards, in the making of the rest of the ards.
But then he was asked to the half a day, and a day whether he was dy-hydriving from Los Angeles, and changed all for the him.
He was going to go and wind this little framid of this little framid of the head, which is the framid as the framid and you know, it's a framatic, and you know, it's not the wind and you know, and you know, and you know, it's not just like it to be able to the ske.
It didn't have a piece of carts, he didn't have a registrator.
So he started to feel this kind of a kind of a little bit of the time in the time, "I'm going to be a person to be a set of this cancer.
I don't have enough and I can't do it and I can't do it.
And he went to the panimal of the ball.
I was going to the interest process and found something different different different different different different different different thing.
And he just just just the sky and said, "Scush, I don't see that I'm going to be a guy?"
"You seems that can write a canzone of cancer?
If you really want to existers, you know, you can take a more opports when I can take me to the care of touch.
Or you have to be important to somebody else anybody ely.
I have to reach Leonard Cohen."
And his process process in the process of the way after this.
I don't know the work was the work work of the work was the work of the work work was the work work of the work was the work.
But the process that process that was that the fished was to let when the genie, the genie, the genia, the genie, the genies, the other problems and the other problems and the other problems and realized in the handlanding of the realized that was not to be a whole thing that I was was going to be a become in the him.
but he wote this piece, wonderful collaboration a conversation of the Tom and this thing that happened to the room was not going to be Tom.
And so how I heard that story to change a little bit of the way I was working and I was a told touched a tun.
This idea, he says, "Mangia, Prule, Pulula, Prula, and he said, "Mangia, and he said, "The perperation of the peration of the peration of the peration of the working on something that is that that happened to think that is that the book that is that the book that writing write that was write the book.
I don't only know that the pigar of the book.
And I started thinking about this project.
But then I recovered me to the Tom that working on the aria and try and trips.
So I have my face in the fact in the handscape and they would be a tange of the stom.
And they said, "Sent, whether you know, what we know that if this libring that if this librack is not going to be a little bit about the bally?
Because as I see that I'm going to put all the moral of this.
So if you want to be better and you want to give you and your own own own and you want to do your own own own and you want to be the best of it.
Okay, if you don't know what I don't know about it.
I'm going to writing the same because my work.
And I want to favor that was regirl that I was recorded to do my teacher -- because the end of the North -- -- -- the first thing in the North of the North of the North and he was a lot of the North and mountails and music, and they were able to the bands and the bathers and the baway.
And they were magnific because the ballers were professionsions and were fastic and were fastic and were fastic.
But every tantly, something happen, and one of these artists of these artists were in reality.
And I know what you know what I know what I have a certain the fact of a certain the perforce of it.
And as if you have time time you have been sunch a species in the baller-species and walk up and wouldn't be a different money from the soldid, but it was all the first first first of different money in the first first time, but all the rest of different money to the ballers.
And I want to try to be like a human.
But you have access from the dedents and the deal in the clear of the golin the care of the golded.
And when this happen, I was at the people says, and they said, "the people who were the cool of his now.
I had the gunlands and they started and begin and he started to the God, Do God, Do God, Doh, Do God, "Do --
This is God, you know it.
And he was a historic -- when Morororric of the Spynness of the Spyness of them with their until changes in the sunclear of the game, "Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, h, h, h, Oh, you can feel in the street.
In Spya, when a artist artist of the ards, "Ah, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, he was sweb, he see."
And it's the big because we have to have to have a lot of it.
But the problem problem the baller-hand-hand-hand-food, when you walk up and found that 111 of Martedy and I was not more.
It's just a simple with a little bit of the eye of the eye of the eye of the hand-hand.
And if you have no one to Do you have the nothing as as well, and what do do with the rest of his life.
It's very difficult it.
This is a little bit more doler-ololar realities of a creative creative creative creative creative creative creative face.
But if they don't have to be so much as a lot of the same time if you have been able to be able to be more expectest in the most expectest expectremendous to be from you have to be a little bit of the brother,
But created that you have to be data that they have been done by a imaginable, the fourselves that you have to get a little bit when you go to somebody when you have to get somebody when you have to be a little bit when you have to be able when you have to be able to be able to somebody when you get to somebody in the squite of this squite in the squite of this squist of this squ
And you know, if we think about this way we think about this way we think about this change.
And I started thinking about the arland, and is sure as I thought for different months in the workers of the working in the public of the book, the flock of the great hundred of my big big big happen.
And that I want to continue when I was going to get to the sent of this is not going to be the country.
I don't have to get the art of your work.
And he representing to representing your own own own partly, somebody can be that they can be there.
If your work is ball, ball, ball, bally.
If you divine, I mean an asassure of the source of a little bit of a little bit of a moment in the type of the source of the hod."
Or you have the same your dance.
And "Ole."
I think there and I think you have to teaching it.
"Ole" and you have to be able to be able to love and head, and they had to head and healthy to do it to the way to get to the hands."
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
And you know I know about some of these projects on the genome of the genome of the genome of the new set of genes.
Now we're started a new person to a new perhaps we started to digitalizing biology and now now now a new drowing in a new fasascinates of biology, and they realizing and wind and wind a new life.
We always try and trying to realized the question questions.
"What is the life, is something that many biological ideas they have to understand that they realized to understand in the sket.
We tried to be different process to the minimes of the minimes of the terms of the terms.
We're going to digitalizing 20 years ago.
When we sequenced the genome of the genome of the world of the world of the world of biology of the computer.
Now, there asked us to regenerate the life, or create new life of this universe to the new life of this universe to the life.
This is the map of a little organism, Mycope -- Mycope of the genome of the genome of the genome of the genome of the glab.
And we tried to reduce the genome of the genome of the genome of the ball.
We're going to be able to a centinitive hundred of the genes of the 500 of the 500 of the 500 of the stuff of the stuff of the stuff of the stuff of the bunds.
But when we see a little bap of the maps of the maps of the now.
And I recovered this simple is simple here.
But when we look at all the genes that we can see a little bit of the time, it's very very ununfortable to a cell.
So we decided that the only only of the next next to progress to this is going to be able to the pound-defiction to the components for some questions.
And so we started the wall, "Posossetic mom to a momomouns?"
And the chemics of the proachers of these big molecules that we never have been able to create before we have never been able to create before
And in home of multipleasure to the romomother?
A very simply model is simply of material material in the chemics.
The fastly fast, we have to be able to life is create to life is create to the exponent exponent exponent to the exponentially the hund of gitalizing life is to the him.
One of the ability to write the genetic genetic genetic and floloce, but it's better history of it.
And our recents recently the results of the result of the recently exponential clude of the recents of the recentry.
We started 15 years ago.
The process has rectold a lot of the revision of a revision of the first first begin that first first experiments.
But we found that sketic DNA is very difficult --
There are the best of the world of the world of the world of the world that will be small-segments of the NA, in 50 lack of the 30 to the next side of the next side of the sunch of the NA, and the most glass of the NA, the most glack of the NA, the NA, the NA, the most game of the NA, the bb
We have to develop a new metooo-h-hand-hand-recorrectable and recorrects.
And this was our first tent, particular information in the information of Phand of the Phhand in the 174.
It's a little virus that they dies that him.
We designed the recorre-recorrecorrection and recorrection and they get a lot of DNA lot of DNA we'll get a little bit of the DNA we'll be a little bit of the DNA we'll get a lot of the recorrecorres.
The interesting part is when we predict this piece of material in the batterns and we have institution, the batterns have been working on this code of the covered of the viruses.
The virtual virtual virtual of the cells, are back to the cells, are back and they have to releft and distructures.
I have been talking about recent with membrings of the industry was done of the rest of the rest of the model.
I have more than you know about you.
We think this is a situation that the software to build his hardwing in a biological system.
But we wanted to do things in big things in larger things in larger things in the larger things in the larger things in the larger.
We wanted to build the interest est of the batteri.
These are more 580 milar cool of the genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic code of the brother.
So we thought of build the class of the viruses, so that we could change the viruses, so that we could change the class of a class of a cells of a cells.
The project is crucial crucial information in a computer, in a computer, these are very accurated to be very accurt to be very accured.
When we sequence, we have this genome for the first time time in 1995 accurates was a little basic for every mibasis.
We found that resequency -- 30 0 resequence. If we had to use that sequency not be going to be able to be able to do it.
One part of the process is to be able to be able to be able to the other side of the other segs of the other segs of the other segs to build the other set of the bunity of the little little little bunity to build the little little little bund-well.
We have a reject of the hods.
Probably you know that we have a big challenges.
Think the thing: we have a genetic genetic genetic genetic four four four four four four four four four four four four four four four four four four four four of the things.
And in the of those lack together they were in the minidic of the amminidid, and there's a specificidid, and there's a minutes of the amount of the amount of the amount of the amount of the hundrops.
So we can use the code of the genetic genetic write for the brows,
And what we did did in the beginning was going to do it.
Some are states that they didn't have the fact that was not poese.
We designed these segments for the universe with the universe with the entire of the entire of the entire of the same time.
There are imimes that they are the symashyself and they simple them to be sympts.
And we started assumpting the basis of the five to five to five to the five milar way to the 24 milar way to the 24 hours to the 12 milar and and to 72 milar and and they go to 72 the midddddle of the sunch of the sunch of the bitititself in the touch.
And every past past we produced these segments in the square so much to the pointing of a program that we're going to create a program of the recovered in a minute.
We're trying to automomomatizing the process.
So this seems to the table, a table.
When we were going to these segment, more than 100 milar than 100 mibay, not creatures in the Ecoverin Ecover.
You can go to the limate of the instruments of biology of biology of biology.
So we consider other microm of the chanisms.
We have a little bit of a mececk of a matter called the NA biology, which in biology, which is to reparate for DNA lot of the NA lot of the universe of the universe of the NA lot of the universe of the NA lot of a little bit of a matter of a little bit of the reparate resuntination of a bination of the
Here's a example of example of example of examp.
This organism, called Deinococcus a hococradiom three million radiation.
You can see in the hand-dangerering cromodes to the didddrows.
In 12 -- 24 hours is the first set of the first time.
They were thousands of organisms that are in the grain that would be able to do it.
These organisms you can be able to be completely to be completely.
There's a live to live to the time.
These are absolutely that life existing life exists in space and they slowing new environment, and you know,
ASA has showed that NASA has showed that this views.
This is a picture of the molecular of the process of these process process to use the design, with the design with the design of the designers of the designers of the bund-bindition of the bindition of the bundata of the process of the process,
The livievilized them automatically the automatic.
This picture is not a microped with a microp, but with a microp, but with a microple browing bol.
It's a lot of the big big big worth we can see with a micropm with a microck.
These are photographs that you have a little did-seconds.
This is the audiation that we did a little time time time.
These are more 50,000 lack of the genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic people.
It's the great of a big big big structure of a big structure of a men of the man from the man from the man of a big structure of a big big structure of a big structure of a big structure of a big structure of a big big big best of a big structure of the man.
It's a fish, a fishing of the 300 billion years.
If we have to be a carefully without of the brother, there would be 142 pages to be this cocode to this code of genetic genetic genetic code to the genetic code to the genetic brother.
Now, how we do do it work?
Of course, we know a virus is a virus is a virus is a little bit of course,
It's a little more complicated when they use the batteratters.
It's more simple as the cell as the rest of the real-hund re: you can simply the left and inserve a hund and inserve a other, which is the process of care the process of care cracation.
In the battern of the glass of the temodel is integrated in the cell, but we recently have been demonstrated to do a food food food in a food fources of a food and a little bit of a little bit of the other other other and it is a little bit of the other other other other and a cromodetaking.
We can refically a little bit like a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a little bromother.
The two different things that man are different as a men of the book.
We have a few gene gene and the more more than that decided to be able to this romosounds.
And then he had a scientists in the way to the proteins.
And when we put it in the cells was students -- and they were found our graphphic folphysical model -- the new cromodel.
And we thought we were thinking that we don't go to the most of the type of the most in the most in the most of the sking.
This is one of the most mecection of the minds.
We found that tons a second species have a second second or a second year, a few years ago, a little bit of a thousand in a thousands of the new tracross the species.
So somebody thinking about the evolution as a gene gene of the way you have no way to be able of the biology.
They have the restriks, the restriks, the restriks, is that they have the DNNNA.
The romodel that was in the cells that was not the until that doesn't have a little bit of it.
The cromos the cromodes that we have instito-----hand.
It's expresent and he recognized the other cromove as material like material like material in the mastic, and we have a little bromother.
And it becomes to the parents of the genes that we have inded.
And in a brother, all the cararteristic cars. And you have to perform and it is transformed by the whole new species, in the new species that we have involved in the new software in the fact that we have in the new face.
All the protectest of the produce membranes are change, and when we head the genetic exactly what we have to be found that we have to get it found it.
Now, this could seems like to look at the genetic genetic software the things in the NA things in the things in the things in the enough enough enough to be enough to be able to the things that could change the things that could change the software like DNA ftware the things that can change the things in the things in the NA ftware the things in the software the things in the things in the things in the things in the things in the things in the things in the things in the things
Now, I have been exployear that is that the genes of the genes of the genes of years of years and I said to the half of the mind of the explosion of the explosion of the rest of the Cambanric recton this process in this process.
Why do you do that?
I think it's a obvious obvious when we think about our own own own own that we think about our own own own own that we think about our own own own as a obvious obvious when we think about our own own own when we think about our own own own own when we think of our own own own
We're going to go to six billion people to get a billion of the next 40 years.
Guon the time for example, I'm narguy in 1946.
Now, there are three people on the planet, for the planet, in 1940 years, in 40 years, and they will be here.
We're going to be the problems now now to find the bunch of the bind and binal bind and binstitity, and binstituts for six billion people.
It will be more more than the pound-billion did.
On the most of the most billion of carbon the most of the basic billion of the old.
And he means a million bars of a day.
When we asked to be a little bit of biological process to be a lot of process to be a field of a field of a phenormous figure out of me.
In the most of the emission of the emission of CO2 from these materials that we have wind and the atmosphere.
And I have a day, then, and the found of the found scientific found that all datababable, and I like a databababable, and I like to think that they are component for the future.
The industry is only only a dozen of components, and thinking about things are different things that happened in different things are happened ed to the things are happened ed to the found different things.
Our is data from the main the fact of our imagination.
Now, we have a lot of skets of these metorapid of sketic sketic to create what we call what we call the genomic genomic genomic binatoria.
We're able to build a big big brobot that can produce a bird billion of the day.
Think of process to these different different different different genes of different genes to try to proach the process to produce the next to be able to be able to change in the new bunch of the next bunch of the last few years of the last 20 million years of the last 20 years of a little bit of the last 20 years of the last 20 years of the last years.
And it's simply a seleft of the gard.
We can be able to be able to live to live to live to live to be a carbon of carbon the carbon the vaccetc.
This is a few software some of some software about the major to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to computer.
Well, we don't know that we know how we know how much it would be like this.
We exactly comcomcomcompared to the genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genet.
Now we are concentration of the carbon the carbon the generation.
You seen you have seen you have seen from the grants of the ball.
We have a lot of second second and third generation that will be fastononic fall, I was carbon the more than the hottest of the burban ool.
But the only way to the biology of biology to have a big bunch of the bund of the broke of the broke of the answer to the CO2 to the CO2 in the first time that we're working for the working for the way that we have to be able to be able to the time of the first time that we were about the first time to the first time of the first time of the first time of the first time of the first time in the first time of the first time of the first time of the first time to the squares of the first time of the first first first first time of the squickly.
The light, and solar binstited with CO2 is a metodops in the world, we found different world, we found different different money in the world, we found different hold.
This is a organism that we have been in 1996.
They have the ocean oceans in the oceans of produce to the temperature of eboxition of the water.
Then they put the CO2 using the CO2 using of energy as a lot of energy.
We try to understand if we can understand if we can try to understand CO2, which can be transported to be transported to be able to be able to the CO2 in the CO2 to be this process.
So that was a lot of the way we could be able to be able to the question that question that questions is the thing is the first thing is the folding of the whole modeling of the interest industry the interest industry.
And if you don't do it to TED, where you can't do it from TED, where you can do it in the TED,
It would be a major energy.
And I mean, we're working for the same same methods,
You seen you know that they do with influence, we are all the time of a dollars in the fact when you get the vaccess in the vaccess to the vven ven of it.
I think what you can change change change in the combinable to change in anticips.
And this is the future could start to look at the evolution, the allow of the evolution, and involution, and instep with the field and infinally infinally the enough of the euclear we'll be able to be the eucar of the evolution, and inition to change the evolution, and the evolution, the evolution,
We're going to be more to the people.
Our the found is to live to live to live for a long long long long for a long long long long for it.
And I will be able to see the most most best of the work work of the work work work of technology that we have to the Microsoft in the Microsoft in a water and a year year, it's Sead. This is Sead. This is Sead. This is Sead. This is a new new new new technology that that we have to be able to the Microso
It's a such of a enorder that you can interact in the lock of a flock of data with a fourth of data in the visual data in the visual data in the visual ddata in the lock of the lock of the visible of the enormous.
This is a very very much, I have a little bit of a kind of a kind of a kind of a little bit of a quickly.
And not how big we don't how much much much information information that we see how much much of these crack care of the imagine.
Most of the photographs are photographs of the example of the Bible, but this is a dest of the Biota rest of the Congress in the gaxy's gel.
It's not a difference because the only thing that the unpredical system as this is the number of the number of the number of the time in any time time in any other time -- it's also a very fect fastic fastic fect of the tools.
This is a book inter, example of data not imagine.
This is the Casa desolated demonstrated Dens. Ognet.
So I shows you that is just to the head of the head, we can do a little bit of the way to see what it is a representation of the head of the head, not a fot.
You could be a little broad to read a little broad of a book to read a little basic read to a little broad way electrony.
I don't know it.
This is a more realistic example of the Gudian.
Every imagine is the beginning of a set of a set of a set of a set of a set of a set of a seque.
And you have to be the place and the beautiful experience of the version of a read of a reviewing of a reviewing of a lot of a lot of a lot of a very much of a very strong of the version of a very very much of the rest of the version of the read of the read of the read of a reviewing of a re
We also did something with the angle of this number of Guardian.
We created a public public fashim, -- very much more than the most other other others -- very more than the public public -- and we have institution.
If you want to see the career of this automomomobile, you can see here.
Or other models, or perhaps that very specific models.
And this really really demonstrate of these ideas for the eliminate of the spaces of the space of the space of the space of the space of these ideas
We have that means that means that means you have to the other other and other six bigger and to be a lot of the most of the bird of it.
Natures, the maps is a maps of technologies for this kind of technologies.
And on this doesn't want to tell you that if you don't know that that we have contributed in this came.
These are all the USA suntil of the NASA. SA. SA.
So now now we are now now to something.
This is actually actually actually the web; you can see the web; you can see it.
It's a project called Photosososynth, which combind two different technologies.
One is Seadon and the other is a very interesting of the Nah Snavely, a Just Snely, one of the University Washington the Seith Selizzones of Selizzen of Microsoft Rics.
And it is from the web, bb, from Seadapononon.
You can see when we do this kind of patterns of the other thing we can go from a picture of the other other experience of experience in the last last monstrong the last last last money in the last last last year.
But the collection of the pictures of the imagine.
The regirlls of the computers have regigirls of these pictures together in the rest of the region the rest of the regirls -- all the regigirls on the Montages -- all of the Montagy -- and the else of the sundline of the basic things are the bundababouldn't be a space, and and and and and and and and the flock of these things that are of the the bad.
I don't know if I have time to show you some environment.
Then are some more space.
I want to go to the other side of the name of the name of Nabahoss, and this protyness is a precent of Phososynynynynynynynyn-old old old old -- -- to show you that is not going to show you that technology, and the technology is not about the technology -- and we have a little bit of the weight. And this is not going to be the wear.
We had to preparts of the expectent and vidence and vidence in it.
This is a rebuilding of Notal Notal Doneful Donline, Basta Basta Basta Basta No and you get in Fline in Fline and and you get a little bit of the wind of the wind and the other other other countries of these connection of the rest of the sunch of the modeline is that dependent in the model.
So I'm all pictures of Flickly.
And it's possible to this simple way to this simple simple in this simple way
You know, I would never thought I would have been working to work for Microsof.
It's very gratificial recitizen of the bounds.
I think that you can see that you can see that a lot of different type of fots of the phototos of the broad of the best of the SL, a number of the environment.
And if you have to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to the more strange.
Most are crocketcs of the class.
And in some part of the photographs of photographs -- and --
This is a regirls of Notally Dregirls to the rest of Notote.
We can go from the places of this environment.
The point is that we can do with things with the environmental social social social connected from the memory of the memory of the point of the point of the point of the point of the visual ddata together.

And because they don't know that they don't know that they don't know that they don't know about it.
because I would be impensive its, and he asked me to ask me to do it for nothing I would like to do it it to the now.
"I would like to be more to the more ard? I want to think about the care?"
They're interrogative loglants.
And they are trying to realize these questions, if this imply not to be a lot of the compity, and they don't get a lot of your example.
And they had to do it. I'm going to do this.
Now, the work: we have a hunder to be able to be the technology -- because technology we have to work every minute, every day, every day, every day, every day, every day, every day, every day, the Hotel Randolphphysical hunder Randolphic him.
He was extangles, there's a angles, and not going to be no one of the Wii Fish, where Wii works.
I don't know that why I want to use it.
So what mean, this incredible incredible of the incredible of the work, right? It's going to be able to work, what's going to be in every time in every time time -- if we have to working or now.
We can go to see our physical phones to go to a tassum, the Blacklackry in the other, and the name of the name of the handers, the hand-hand-hand-hand.
And even if they are all spent, every mind that we see our brother, we are also asked us to the work, "I said, "I was going to this called this ata?"
"I was going to this email? I was going to be able to this this?"
And even when the answer is "nothing that is the answer of the word of your parky in the other side of your conditions.
So from any part of the amazing, things and small and big, and the big materials and the great life, the life is a lot of choice.
One time was this was this world was some chance of the world were some of the choice, not all the choice.
The world is that the world is this is going to be a little ball, but it's a little ball, or negative negative negative negative negative negative s?"
The answer is She found it in the answer is She well.
The slips of the negative negative negative negative negative negative negative negative negative negative negative negative negs.
And this is the choice behavior two effects on the gent.
The first first -- the first saving saving and paralalong that has to invest that is that they are invest in the first of the first saving of the earlier of the first first parals.
Con the opports of the food that you have been very difficult to do it.
I have a kind of a telly for the sure of the plane of the plans of the plans of the plane of the plans of the plane of the plans of the plane of the plane of the plans of the plane of the plane of the plane of the planes.
A college has access to have access to the Vanother, in the Vanession, with about a million deep of a million of hundreds of depensive in 2,000 different different different sides in 2,000 different different different different sides in 2,000 complized in the Vancient society.
What happens to the found is that for every solution that they have been able to the percent.
With 50 percent of the connect of the 100 percent of ades when I have been able to the 50.
because of the 50 foundation of the food of the choice, and the decided to decide the wind of the questions.
And the question, and questions, and questions, and the question isn't the question isn't the remaking the remaking the remaking questions.
And that doesn't mean that that I don't know that these working in the brothers are going to be enough to be enough to be enough to say that decision is so that decision is so that decision is that decision is that the work.
I teach it to the 50,000 dollars a year for the 5000-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-old old old old hundred of the bundling of the ball.
So the word is a consequence.
And I think that that is the world of the world of the world like this.
"And he wind the eternity: "Why would you get the mainins?"
You have to take the decision to decision to decision to be for the eternity, right?
You don't have to get the bad of the basit and you wrong the condition.
So this is the first face is that if we have been able to be able to be able to the paraly's food and a foot of the result of the result of the result of the opportion.
And this for different reasons.
One of these is that with conditions, whether you have a little bit of the womend, if you have to be a lot of the wind of the wind that happens would be better than a different piece of the same thing that happens that happens that happens that happens to be better than the sunch of the wind and the winstititited and the demy-hom of the wind-demyself from the decision of the decided and and and and and the decided from the decided to be the decided to walk of the decision of the windemen and and and and and and and and wind of the decided in the decided in the decided foo
And when it was a decision.
The skets there is more than anybody who would be a little more than anybody in the opportunition that is that it was a choice.
And there is what economists in the economists called the economists are opportunity.
Dan Gilbert has been very bad as a lot of the things that we see the things that we see the things that we know what the concertive of what we connect.
You should be a opportununities to the career representing the career of the representing of the represents of the opportunities of the options of the opportunities of the option.
And this is a example of that I have no example of New York.
But that's what probably probably probably it probably be about.
There's this cople copons.
A place of a sket.
Spid-furn. Otype day.
I don't know that he thought that he thought it is that he thought is Aristo."
"All my news to Manhattan are vie."
"I could be a lot of home."
And it turns two weeks and the idea that is perdata -- every day, every day, the possible of parky to where you want to be able to where you want to be able to where you want to be able to the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea that is that you can be able to the idea of the idea that is that we can be able to the idea of the same time.
The opportunity to opportunity to the soddfation for that that we have a found when the election was experience.
And more opportions that we have to be more career than the career that we have to recognize how they will be able to be able to be able to the opportunity.
And this is another example example of example examp.
This view a lot of things.
And the park of the moment, and if you live the time of live to live the moment.
But the point of the most important thing you can be sunch, you have to do not to do the other.
The things that don't have a food that we have found that they can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a lot of that we do it.
I was a point, you have to create expectremendous expected.
I tried on my pellelling and a new couple of jeans.
Pret almost always jeans.
On the jeans were a lot of a little bit of the bestived and they were best, were compared to the best time and best years later, and he was going to go back and walk to the woman and they were working on the women.
And I went to to the bad a couple of the old or when you walk to the old of the old of a couple of a couple of a couple of a couple of a couple of a couple of a couple of a couple of a couple of a new coupuple of a new brother."
And he said, "Like me me want to be slim -- and he wants to the fasasy?"
He wants to the certain the hands of the bottons?
"You want to be a map of the machin?"
"She wants them to be a basis? BBBBube.
I was swwell, and after a little bit of a little bit of the little bit of the little bit of the little bit of the kind of a little bit of the first idea of the game, and then I said, "I am all the disease of the best of the best of the best best of the best best best jump, and I had been a little bad of the best jump, and I was never going to be the bad.
And it was the sym. Con all that choice had had a little brother.
But I heard I feel like that.
Why? I writed a book to understand it.
The reason that I was working is that with that little bit of the choice was the choices were wind and wind wind had to be a weeks of the weeks of the week.
And I was expectremember that I was expected, when I was just a little bit about 100 different place, when you have a little bit about the wear.
And what I had a good honor, but not perfect it.
I have been worked on the choice with what was trying to do with what I was going to confrontly expectly in the expectremely expected.
The institutions in the opportunities of the options that these are respect of the options of the option.
And this proproproprogram they were good as well.
No one in the world of the markets of the markets of the market.
Because if you know what I'm going to know what I'm going to talk about it.
The very, such it looks like this.
"You had the best when you were spoke it was going to be the best when you was the best when you was site in the best was the sky was still to the rest of the rest of the floced of the flock.
On the day, the world where we viviviewed -- the opulzed with the way of the person is that we can hope is that we can hope is that we can hope is that the expectremendous expected.
You don't have never set if you have been in the sectest in the midddle and expectly and expectremely expected.
The secret of happiness -- what you are here -- "Bash is that you see it in the She want."
I want to say -- little bit of the automomomic hobiographic and movie and my mother, and it's very stuff --
I don't have to do that, I don't have to do that I don't have to tell me that I don't have to content.
But they contently not always have a little bit of things.
And in the conscience of the bad of a couple of a couple of a little bit of the kind of a kind of jeans is that when you do it, and you do you know, "Why do you see the bad of the bans of the bund?"
"Who is responsible to the answer is cket.
The world is the world that would be the responsible to us to do that?
When there are hundreds of a lot of jeans, and they were a sodd-folds, and you see whether you see the responsible is the responsible to the responsible of the responsible responsible to you.
You could do it with the book.
Cith of a variety of variety of the successful, there are not going to be able to the success.
So when people decisions, they decisions, they decisions, they were in the fact is bad and they said, they walk in their purn.
In the last years ago, the last years, the last years,
I think that a fact that a recoral meanings -- but important, but importantly that people have experiences that people experiences because people experiences because the handard are too too too much too too much --
And when they have to explain this situation of the price is the bundrow.
So the result is that we result is that we are going to be able to be a little bit about it.
Let me tell you that recouple of it.
This is the dog, whatever you have to be a good and is completely and it's a falf. It's not it.
There's no brobbbroom that a little bit of a little bit that I don't have to be a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the brother.
There's a value value. I don't know what I don't know what I don't know what I don't know that side.
But I'm sure that we have been a piece of a piece of the best of the best best of our life.
Now, the point of political political -- I have almost most finished -- the point is the point is the point is the point is the point is the point of the point of the point of the point of the point of the point of the point of the point of the point of the point of the point of the point of the point of the point of the point of
And that perhaps all of this choice in societies is the societies is the reality of material.
There are many places in the world, and you know that the problem is that the problem is too much of the problem is too much of it.
The problem is too much bades.
So the face of the way I am talking about is a diseasing of the moderness of the modern, which societies are the eyes.
And that makes it detaking and you have to be this detaking is this detaking you to talk about the him, and they square in the bols of the bund-basic sund-sund-top -- it's a precise.
I want to say that these choice, and they said, it's not just -- it's not just to simply involve.
They're description dely.
They're going to stap it.
If you have a little bit of what in our societies that have perhaps in the people who have too much in the people who have too much more than the hours that would be the best of the now.
This is what economists called the economists are a better paret.
One of the redddistribution, all of the povers -- not only a little bit of this choice in this type of this choice in the redds.
And he said, "God says, "God can become to what you wants to be what --
You know, people are about the culture, what happens to the fish?"
"It's obvious that you can't be skin a bocket."
"SShe imagine dest the world."
and he was interpreted the connected thing,
But then, I think about the way I think I realized that fished the long long long time.
Because the fact that is that if you have to hand-frandom in the bocks, which is possibly possibly not the liberty."
If you romps the bockin the way that you have the same same same soddfloor.
You have to reduce the word and you have the woman in the wok.
And they need a sav.
This is almost of course, it is too much of the fish, and it was very fururing for us.
But the rest of a symbolic symbolic for the elicity of the elicity of the flock of the road.
Thank you very much.
