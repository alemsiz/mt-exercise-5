And last year I showed these slide to show that the calculation that the calote of the artic, which is about three million years had the size of 48 U.S. clay is a stret-Agggo, is a 40-8-and-8-percent.
However, this subvalue of the problem because it doesn't show the glacier.
The calculation is a certain sense, in a certain sense, the heart customer of the global climate system.
You go and put it and return it and you get the summer of the summer of the summer of the summer and you get it in the summer of the summer and return it into it.
The next next device, is a quick rolled the last 25 years of the last 25 years.
The ice ice lost ice are signed in red red in red red in the red red red red.
As you can see it in the blue blue box.
That's the ice in inver, which is the ice in the summer of the summer of the summer in the summer of the summer in inver, which is the ice in the summer of the summer in the summer of it.
You can see that the ice ice ice of five years or more or five years or more -- is like blook, which is like blood here is like the body.
In 25 years is going to be in this way, like this.
This is a problem because the size of the ground of the ice ice ice of the ocean and where there are enormous amount of carbon on -- if you have enormous amount of carbon on the microbe.
It really, in the totality of the atmosphere from global warming, that amount of global warming, superthat amount of -- superundouble this point of not to release.

Video: Wow! At Gor: Look is the question is if we are also going to be the us.
A reason is that this scale of the termic scale of the Groenland,

If you want to know how the level of the sea ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the eth, here is where to reach.
These are increasing are increasing very quickly.

The environmental desastring is increasing a range of the normal and without precedents.
Four times more numbers in the last 30 years of previous precedented 75.
This is a game of all insustainable of it.
If you look at the context context if you can see the consequences.
In the last five years we added 70 million tons of CO2 -- 25 million tons in the oceans every day.
Look at the Pacificer Amermer, from Americh, and in the Amer, and on the glass of the subcontinent parts of the subcontinent in the oceans.

oil is a problem, and the carbon is a problem,
The United States are one of the most emissions, together together to China.
And it was proponying a lot of carbon on carbon on coal.
But we're assisting a change of direction.
These are the projects of the last last few years and some of alternative propositions of alternative verage.
At every way, there's a political lott-political lott-
The carbon industry and oil industry has spent a year 250 million dollars in the last year to move the carbon on the last year to promote carbon the last year to move the last year to move the last year for promote in the last year to promote the last year to promote the last year to promote the last year to promo

Thank you very much.
The last year at TED I did a book on LHC.
And to get you to go back to how to work on how it works.
So I think it is. And for those other time doesn't have to the other time -- the LHC is the biggest experiment -- 27 miles of circle methetic circle of circle conference.
His to reach the conditions that were present less than a billion more more than a billion from the universe -- until 600 million times a second.
All is just the environmental environment.
This is the machine in Geva.
We have these min-Big Bang Bang in the rise of the rise in the rise of the book.
This is what I work. It's called ATLAS -- is a 44 meters -- is 44 meters and a diameter diamets.
This is a spectacular image of ATLS in building so you can notice that you can see proportions.
The 10 sectors last year we have access the machine for the first time.
And this picture was taken from ATLATLAS.
It was because of immense immense in the room of control control of control.
It's a first fashion particles that had done all the around the LHC, ententering collise in the LHC, and deliberately, with a part of the LHC, and spread particle in the heavy.
In other words, when we see that image the 10 sects, we realize that the machine is a great liver of the machine is a great liver living.
I don't know if it was this to do more opposed to do that when somebody went on Google and vide that the beginning, which is this:
That means that we have a cultural impact.
About a week week, there was a problem with the machine, because of these movies here -- these movies -- these movies -- these films -- these films -- these films -- these films -- these films -- these films here -- these films -- these films -- these films -- these films here -- these films of this movies -- these films here -- these films -- this movies -- these films of the glass.
These movies are 13,000 print when the machine is the multi-year-old hold hold of the powerful powerful works.
Now, the technicians between you look at the movies and dirand, "It's not true. I'm movie too underlying too underly."
And instead can do it because when they're very free cosident cosident cosident cosident cool of the conductors.
So, at least 271 grade, a temperature temperature in the space, these films can bring that in the room between the stellow can bring that corporate that crack up the room can bring that corporate to the room between the stellow of the space, these films can bring that corporate in the stellow of the space, these films can bring that ck of the space, these films can bring that cell of the space, these films can bring that up that in the space of the space,
In one of the grounds between the most population in LHC, there was a dift of the LHC, there was a difabrication.
So the movies of the surround laws and 13,000 print suddenly meet a electricity.
This was the result.
Now, this is still more impressive if you think that these magnets, and that these magnets, and which is about 30 centimetries, and that are slow-centimetries.
They are damong about 50 magnets.
We had to give them what we did -- what we did it.
We have repristined and justed the ust.
Now I'm going to go back to their underground in their place.
English the end of the LHC will be new inte.
We acceness it and we expect to get the data to judgment or him, and we continue so our avventure to find what the morning, and so we have the universe.
Now, of course, in a way, these are reaching the other huses to reachute the value, and of the engineering of science and engineering science and engineering the engineering of the engineering of the conflute.
I think the fact that it's so hard to go over the limits, the same thing about the same way of things like LHC.
I'd like to conclude with the words of a scientist English English Humphy Davy, the quality, I guy, imagined in the inuseful experiments of his pupill, his pull, his pupill, his pullo -- "Niman is a very dangerous consumer than the human consummer of the human consummer -- that is not that they are mystery -- that is not to be a new money, and the human convince, which is is to the convince, and that are the human human constitute,
Thank you.
I want to start asking you to rethink about how to do it, by the morning, you play the morning.
As you go to the way and reaching them and to make it and move them and move it and to do it and solve solve problems and to think and solve education and the relationships.
The space, is propush is to connect the world around us.
So, by inforce the user of our interaction with the ush of our interaction with objects with my consulator Jevan Kalanithi, and I started asking asking and I started asking here: "And when we use a computer, instead of mouse as a polar polyming polar as a cool polymmelts of the mouse of the construction of the system,
and to our fund?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer, building Siftable.
And what a lot of words, a whole whole thing is a whole whole thing like a great biquick biquery computer.
And what a lot of words, a whole whole thing is a whole whole thing like a great biquick biquery computer.
You can move with the hands and you can see the hand, you know, to hear the movement movement and a radio wireless and a radio wireless and a radio wireless and a radio wireless to it.
But the morning, they're objects like the morning, as the morning, you can just just make it just good errors.
Siftable is the example of a new ecosystems to manipulate the information digital information digital information.
And as they become more physically consciously, you know about the movement, and other, and which, and the other, and they become more physically movement, as we move them to the other, as we move them to the function of interaction.
He will start with some simple example.
This Siftable is configured to show of the video, if you can can do this video, if you can go back and yet it is, if you win the other side side side the other side side side the other hand,
These are interacactive interactive acties.
If you do them as I think, is their intorror to what they into.
If they are circumster and they can get a little bit of it.
If they are circumster and they can get a little bit of it.
They also have their movement movement and uncline.
We realize that one of the interesting implications of interaction was the community to use the community of the data that is a color like if it was a color like a color like if it was a colate cold.
In this case, we have three Siftable configured as a several suses and I can use them to the color in the middle of color in the middle of color in the middle of the color of the color in the middle of the color and I would use them to be in the middle of the green tracking and I can use them to be like a
and I can use them to be in the central of the central in the central of the central in the central of the central color in the central of the color in the central of the color in the central of the color in the central hand and you mix them to be missing the color of the color in the central war in the cent, where you miles on
If we are too much later, we can reach a little bit of place.
I'm also beautiful, as the chance of apters, as the mathematics and games of logic and games where people can try and see the speed things and see the results.
Now I'm --
This is a sequence of Fibonacy that I do with a equation-equations.
Here we have a words of words that is half a Scarabeo and Boggle.
Orrrically, in the case on every Siftable, Praticrate, Pratically, in every turner in the Siftable, and while if you try to be in the Siftable, and while you're looking at a dictionary wildarious actice, and as you can control the words of course, in the Siftable, and while you can control the S
And then after about 30 seconds of the land, you have a new set of letters and new possibility to try and new possibility to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try and new possibility to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try and new possibility to try to try to prove and new possibility to try to try to try to prove and
Thank you.
This is what the children came to the Middle Lab, I did it in a way that tried them and I was going to have a video video.
And they have a lot of them --
And one of the interesting things of this genive is that you don't have to give people a lot of educational educational people in the whole istructions.
You just say, "Compons of the word," and they know exactly what to do exactly what to do.
That's how to do it.
This is our betterwards more young people on the road.
It was just wanted to be a clarge-to-to-to-to-clar.
They are only morning, for him.
Now, this is an applation of a interactive activity.
We wanted to build a tool-re-to-a-re-to-a-re-to-a-re-to-to-a-re-to-re-building for the lingue adapts is Felix.
It can be able to make personal new characters in the scale, the Siftable to their own sociated with their associated with their own associated with their own associated with their own associated with their own associated with their own associated with their own sociated person.
It can be able to make personal new characters in the scale, the Siftable to their own sociated with their associated with their own associated with their own associated with their own associated with their own associated with their own associated with their own sociated person.
So, it's doing the sold.
Video: The only is surprising --
David Merrill: Now it has brought a treatment in the scene.
Video: Gererery treatment arancient treatment.
Bel work! Y!
So to school, Siftable and put it close to the neighborhoose --
Video: Bau!
And as it invention history.
Video: Ho!

Vulululy -- the gaco.
DM: The last example I have time time to show you is a tool, to do is a tool, to be a solar music.
It's a tool, to make music.
Siftable here are acting from sounds like the bottom and bacteria and bacteria --
Every one of these has four different variations, and you can choose what to use.
You can even have to insert these sounds in a sequence of your pleasure to your pleasure as you can like your pleasure as well.
And it just just to touch a sounds a sound."
These are actually that you can control from the live and the movie filters.
The attachaches to a sum and then I sinct it to the provide it.
And then there are the general effects like time and fliver, which is apply to interviewing the whole sequence.
We look at how it works.
Video: God M: We will try to put a basic in two Siftable Redtable to be in a serious series, we can add other based on the bottom of it.
Now I put a line, I put a bass.
Video: DM: Now I add percent usies,
Video: Good ood the movie of the bacteria to the effect of the living thing from the live of the living thing.
Video: DM: I can speak the whole sequence of sequence on the time from a bunch or from the other.
Video: DM: And I'm going to add the bottom of the lower to give more expression.
Video: DM: I can recombining the sequence of the Reses."
So I didn't have to planning the first time, but I can suddenly root, but I can be longer or more corner.
And now, finally, I can sfue the entire Redtacking on the Siftable Siftable to the Sifty "volume."
Thank you.
So, as you can see my passion is to build new interfacts man-machine is to build more like workers as a brain and body.
And today, I had time to show you one of the results of this lost and some possibility that we try to bring out of the lab lab out of the lab lab of the lab lab of this lost results.
The concept that I want to transmise is that is coming this new generation of the design of interacting with digital media media in our world.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the time to talk to all of you.
I'm a written writing track.
And I want to be books is my professional exsion is more than that, of course,
It's also the love of my life.
And I don't expect that it can change it.
But I said that, something particularly happened recently in my life and in my life and in my life and I was going to realibrate the whole whole relationship with this work,
The particular thing is that I was recently written this book, this biography called "Mangia, Prega, Prega, and different quality, Ama" the quality of my precedently -- and it became a big world and become a big moon, but it became a big mother's interactional --
And the result is that everywhere you were condent as if you were condent as if you were condent as if you were condent as if you were condent as if you were condanned.
It is true -- condannata!
They are going to me now all worried and said, "You don't have a lot more to do betbetter.
You don't have a paper, to write for all life without any more to be able to create a book that can be able to make a book a book that can math anybody h?"
that can care about somebody h?"
It's rassically, you know.
But it could go worse -- I was going to tell me that more than 20 years ago, when I started to say people -- I was a true -- I wanted to be a trick trick.
I would put it on the same reaction of the bottom of the land.
And people say, "Well I don't have to be successful to have success?
You have no paper, the refired re-fired re-fired re-fired re-fired re-fired re-fired re-fired refired that the Cririver?
You don't have to do this mestive for all life without without that anything to be in the life without any swouldn't be on a heart of slower suse?"
So, you know, you know it.
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is "Yes."
I am paper, I have all those things.
I always had a country in it.
And I also have a lot of other things that people wouldn't have to be to ind.
As the tree and other things that are spaving and other things like this.
But, as much about how I thought I was thinking and I wondered to ask me is why?
It's rational rational rational it?
It's logiven that anybody who who have to be spavented by a work that you feel sent to do it.
But what is that particular is that in imprese creative to make sure that it is about the healthy of the minute of the minute of the minute of the mind?
As my father, for example, he was a chimic engineer and I don't remember one time in his 40-year-old activity engineering activity to be engineering to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineering to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer if it was asked if it was asked if it was asked if it was asked if it was a chance to be engineer and what?
It was never -- that block of engineering John, how do you go to the John, how do this?
It was not working on it, right?
Onestly, the engineers as a group like group don't have certainly uncertainly the reputation of being alcouraged to be alcouraged to be alcouraged to you.
We wrote enough this reputation and not only writers but creatives but creatives of all of the general being enormmous instable, and we have this reputation of it.
And it's not going to look at the tristand contacking of magnifies of the magnificent creative that only in the 11st century, just in the 1th century, and often to them,
And the ones that don't have to be remarkable to be really, really, they have been disdisdisappeared by their womans.
Norman Mailer, before I did, first of the last interview, he said, "My book has killed a little bit more more than the provide of their life.
But we don't get the notion that is why we heard these things like to say because we heard these things like this, we have completely interiorated and accepted the notion that creativity is a way you walk and the notion is going to get up and that the art, and it will get it to the wind, and it will be going to get up and enjoy to get it on the notion of the mind.
And the question I want to do all of this ide?
And it's good for this thing -- because of you go from a centimeter distance to me not good, but it's not good for anything about this supposition.
I think it's odiose.
And I think it's also dangerous and I don't want to see the next century.
I think it's better to encouraging our great creative mind.
And I mean, in my case -- in my case -- in my case -- it would be very dangerous to be in the same kind of suppositions, except the circumstances of the constantly dition to the circumstances that are in my career.
Of true -- unk you know, I'm pretty young people, I've been a lot of the time.
I still have about four decade in my work in me.
And it's very likely to write that anything else else else in the world as the world as the world as the job of my last book.
He went back, because we all are more or less friends here -- is likely to my greatest successful is to my greatest in my spalls.
Oh, Ges: Ges:
You know this is the genive of thinking that leads a person to start to be to go to the nove in the morning, and I don't want to do it.
I would continue to do this work we do.
So, the question becomes up to it?
And so I would sell me after a lot of reflflession, which is to work is to write is to write is to create a costruck costructure, right?
I was in some way to find a distance of safe between me, which is write and my natural natural mind, and my natural natural -- and I was going to get and and so I was trying to do it through the time, and to look at the time, and to see the time, and to see if they could have the best ideas and more healthy and more healthy and more healthy and more healthy and more healthy and more healthy and more healthy and more and more and I was trying to see that I was going to
as to help people believe that creative people to make the risks of creativity.
And that research me to the Great and the ancient Roomom.
Seguitemes because it goes back and then back back back back and then go back back.
Nellelant Greek and Roma -- people don't seem to believe that creativity is to be being inspired to be being inspire to be unexpect?
It was thinking that creative creativity was this spirit and that they come to the men and who come to a few people distant and unknown as a distant distant distant and unknock and unknown as well.
The green green the spirits of the spirits of creativity creativity of creativity is "demony."
Socrate, wonderful, it was a demone that elargivels from mostly smote from most.
Romans were the same idea, but called that a kind of spirit without a genium.
The Romans didn't think of Romans didn't think that a genide was a particularly intelligence of a particularly intelligence.
They believed that a genide of entity in the murch that was actually in the murts of a study artist, a little bit like the Robby, and Dobby, and who came out of the British work and that it came up to the work of that worked.
Each -- -- -- -- -- -- -- this is the distance of which is the psychologists that costruct psychologists that protects to work on the job.
And all of the people who was so that it work?
So the ancient artists were protons of things, like the example of the things like for the good narcisal now?
If your work was exceptional -- you couldn't take it to the mer, all knowledge that we were helped by this geniincorporeo.
If your work fail, it wasn't all the way of the tum?
Everybody knew that was your geniest to be a unable inable income in.
And so people han concept in Occident Occident for a long time.
And then the Rindication came and all over and it change, and this big idea; we put the human bebeings and the mysteries and the mysteries and the mysteries of creatures that write the whole of the creatures that write device.
This was the human rational of human rational and people started thinking that creativity creativity was completely from the hydrophic divide from the hydrophons.
And for the first time in history, you know, it was to reference this article or a genius rather than than a genius with genius rather than a genius.
And I think, I think, was a big error.
I think that allows to somebody, a simple person creating as a reciciplent as a recicipe and the surprising and the mystery of all the mystery and eterhicor or or a good responsibility to the fragile in the fragile of the fragile that human.
It's like to ask someone to teach the sold.
I started in the whole form of the ego and creates all these ingestyle, waiting on lost loperformance.
And I think it was this pressure to have been 500 years old.
And if this is true, and I think that is the question becomes and hold it it be?
Can we do it different?
And I go back to a more antic understanding of the relationship of human relationship and mystery and mystery creative relationship of the relationship of human relationship of human relationship.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we can't get 500 years of thinking about 500 years of thinking about 18 minutes.
And there is people who are probably a lot of people who would be brought up the scientific scientific notion on the notion of the notion of the notion of the same projects.
I would probably not tell you that I would have all about this thing.
But the question I want to do is -- why is it -- why now?
Why don't don't you think about this way?
Because it has more more more more than ever ever ever heard for explain to explain the process of creative process.
One process that as anybody who has been trying to do something -- so fundamentally, all here -- yet, it doesn't be in the rational behavior.
And, in fact, it can be completely paranorormal.
I did this insuddenly with the Ruth Stone, which has now 90 years, but that has now 90 years, but that was a poetck for all life and I said, if that was a little bit in the Virginia, and I felt it in the wall, in the Virginia, and I felt it was going to be in the country -- and I was a pocespecially in the country --
He said that was like a fragorous phragorous phragorous phragorous phragorous phragorous phragorous phragorous phragorous phragorous phragorous phragorous phragorous phragorous phragorous phragorous phragory.
And that was rotating in the land.
It was to be to get the land under the land under the land under his feet.
He knows to have one thing to do that point and it was to do that point and it was like, "Cood,"
And it goes back to the house and it was going to be following the poetpoia, and she would not take another piece of paper, and a pile of free, and the train the train the page, and the ror of the page and the ror of the page.
Sometimes it doesn't be as quickly as much as it as a cooled and correcent and correcent in the house and the rottoled and she was going to rotolate through the landscape would be and continued to rotolate through the landscape, as if she said, "another hour and she would be another poet."
And then there were -- this piece of not the pay -- there was no time -- there were times the time was almost lost as much lost as much lost as much lost as well.
So, it was trying to the house and was trying to the cart and the hand the rotle, and it was just like if it was as if it was as if it was as if it was like if it was like if you put it up with the other hand the off.
He was the cover office and the coda and the released it in his body and the reveal and the page.
And in these cases, the pockey would be presented on the perfect page, but the last word at the last word at the last word at the last word at the last word at the last word at the last word of the last word at the last word of the last word at the last word of the last word of the last word at the first of the last word of the last word of the first last word of the last word of the first time,
So when you feel about -- is a praise -- is exactly the remainal process of my creative process.
Not all my creative process, it's not a constructured constructure.
I'm a mul, and my way to work is -- I sweet me to be on the same ororary to the same time and go on the same time.
But I even even even in my head, I was going to be on the consciously, I was going to be in the time.
And I guess that many of you have a face.
You know, even though the work and ideas came to me to be being being being being able to be a certain source of the function of it.
And what is this thing?
And how can we relate to the head, as we do not even even though the head, pluttoo, which do we do it?
And as I relook at the best example of me -- the best example that I have is the musicians -- I interviewed in Tom Waits, which I interviewed different years ago for a newspaper.
We were talking about this, and you know, Tom, for the magazine of life was the incarnation of the article of the article of control, to control these species, to control these species of implated.
But then I went down to the hot, and a day when it was driving on a Los Angeles, changed everything for him.
He was going to go fast, and it was a little bit of this little framework of a melodia, which comes in his head, as it does the inspiration, and it is wonderful, and the wish wouldn't be as a release, but it doesn't know how to take it down.
It doesn't have a piece of car, has no maya, has no no record.
So I started to feel this kind of old old antum to be growing in him in him and suse, and I sessioned it from this song lost from this song lost loper, and I would be able to be in this lost of it.
I'm not good enough to do not do it and I can't do it.
And instead of going to go in the panimal --
He did something completely new process and he did something completely new thing.
He just said, "Well it just said, "Cuse, you know, I don't see what I'm driving the skin and I just will drive the sky.
"You know, does it seem to write a song song --
If you really want to exist, you go back to a moment when I can take a current time to you.
Something to do anyone else today.
And I wanted to disturbing Leonard Cohen."
And his process working working on the process of changed this.
Not the job, the work was still dark as well.
But the process, and the weight that was releleased when it was released when the genius, the geniest genius, the genius that would be remainly remaining it from where it was going to be a whole thing.
but he sused this peculie, wonderful bizarra collaboration a conversation between Tom and this strange thing that was not Tom.
So how the story that story is to change a little bit of the way I was working and I was going to be a time.
This idea, I save me when I was written "Mangia, Ama," and the Amama," and the site of the disperation where we all all when we are working on something and we all when we are working on something that is going to be the worse -- that will be the worse -- that is going to be the worse -- that is going to be the worse --
Not only good worst book -- the worst book --
And I started thinking about to the project.
But then I remember Tom that Tom that I talk to the air and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and it.
So I put my face on the hands on the hands and directly my comments to a cornal cornal cornal cornal cornal corner.
And I said, "What if you know, you know, I mean, you know, if this book is not going to be like that if this book is not going to be like this, right?
Because as I see that I have no more than that.
So if you want to be better -- you have to deal with your party.
Okay. But if you don't do it, I know what I don't know about it.
I'm going to write the same because it's my work.
And I would like to do it was recorded that I was presented to do my word," because -- the end is -- the end of the North Africa -- -- sitting in the North Africa is the North Africa and clearly -- and clearly as much of the North Africa and music, and music, and music, and music that they were going to go to the hand until the trebe.
And they were always magnificent -- because the ballers were very great professionals.
But every tant, I think, something happen, and one of these artists becoming in a reality receive change.
And I know what you know about what I know is that you have seen everything, in a certain point, a certain point, a lost way,
It was like the time you stopped up through a kind of ballery and wouldn't be doing anything different from the sun, as the only one of the solar -- but everything is all the time.
And suddenly not just like a human being.
But you acceous accepty in the Waake in the Western of divinced in the Western and dively.
And when this next time this next time, people knew what it was going to do what it was called his name.
They were the hands and started to cant, "Allah, God God, God Goo, God God, God God."
That's God, you know.
And I was going to be the Mororororves: when the Mororororns, previous pre-changed and reading the will, and the wise of "Allah" in the middle of "Wah" in the corride or in the corride or in the corride or of the Spppacking or in the corride or of the Spymer in the corride of the Sppppacenthor
In Spage, when a artist has done something impossible and magic -- but he said, "Wah, magnificent -- one -- one -- one -- one last last last last last last last last last last last last last last last last last last last last last one.
And it's greater because we have to do it.
But the problem comes the morning, for the ballery hallery -- when you can see the 11 of the Marted's 11 of the Martedged in the morning, and last last Dod is not more.
It's just a dead deal with a big male in the key knee, and maybe not do that altee to that alteze altea.
And maybe nobody will be the name of God still as the real way -- and what does is it to do with the rest of his live?
It's hard to be difficult to it.
This is one of the most painting to do in a life creative life.
But maybe it has to be so much of being so much if you can get it to not believe that that the most extraordinary thing about your own being from you to be as to be as to be as to be as to be as as to be as to be as as you have to be so much as you have to be so much as you have to be so much angoing.
But I believe that I'm going to be data in prester from a imaginable imaginable of this team of the life that you have to go to somewhere you have, when you finally fine.
And, you know, if we think in this way to change it.
And so I started thinking about it, and it's safe, and it's safy as a different time of the book that I was a lot of the book that I will be prestant, the dangerous pushing of my greatest -- I was going to be a great successful successful cheap of my greatest --
And what I have to continue to tell me when I feel elaborate by this is, I don't have been had.
Not just just just your work.
It looks like to present, you can do it for your party, any one can be about.
If your work is ball, bally.
If the devince, I would assumed to leave up to leave up a few kind of wonderful to leave a few kind of wonderful time through your tums, then "Ok!"
Something to the same your dance.
And "O!" I said, "You know, I do it.
I think I got to teach it.
"O!" I mean, I only have advertis; it only for human and headlines to be on the deal with with the advertis;
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
As you know I've been talking about a lot of these projects on the human genome on what can meaning and discovered about genes.
We're starting to start a new fall the biologigic biologigigic and now to start to the biologists and now we're going to be in a new fashion and sintentertaining life.
We always tried to do the big questions.
"What is the liver living?" is something that many biological games I think, is a lot of biological lives.
We tried different approach, reducing the minimum minimum in terms of the terms of the terms of the terms of the terms of the terms of the terms of the terms of the terms of the terms of the terms of the terms of the terms of the terms of the terms of the terms of the minimply.
We're digitalizing by almost 20 years old.
When we sequenced the human genome was to get from the world from the analogical world, the digital world of the computer.
Now we asked us to do the life, or to create the new life of this universe to digital digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, which is the genome of the genome of the most small between those that can autory in the lab lab in the lab of the lab of the lab that can autory.
And we tried to reduce the genome to believe a little bit more smaller than one of the little bit more smaller than that.
We are able to eliminate a center of genes about 500 of the about 500 of the 500 of the 500 of the genes of about 500 of the genes of about 500 of the genes of about 500 of the genes of about 500 that are here.
But when we look at his map meththolic maps is relatively simple as simple as a nostrength.
It creates this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate a time, is very impossible to get a cell cellula that can bring a cell cellure.
So we decided that the only only way to progression is synthetize this romobile to cool the mobile mobile modifire to put some of these questions of these questions of these questions.
And so we started the preventure of "Can we can synthetic a chromostly tak?"
Can you feel about to make these great molecule molecules that we never have been able to create before I eat at the first time to do before you have?
And in case of the provide of a tak?
A tails is just a chance of the improperly inher.
The speed that we are able to digitalize life is growing the life is growing to be being being able to be exponential exponential exponential exponential of the life is growing to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a digital life is going to be able to be able to be able to be able to
Our ability to write the genetic code code code of the code of course, but it's better better than it is improgree.
And our most recently results the door on a curve curves.
We started more than 15 years ago.
The process has reduced a lot of the past, starting with a bioetic reviewed first experiments.
But we found that synththetize DNA is very hard to be very hard to it.
There are degrees of thousands of cars in the world that products of DNA, the long chance of the long 30-town cle proces: the most undition is a degenerative general is a long rolls -- more errory.
So we had to develop a new method to assembling these frames and correcent mistic mistake.
And this was our first trying to start with the digital information from Phi 174.
It's a little virus that kills kills that kills bacteria kills that is killed bacteria that is a little virususes that is killed bacteria kills.
We designed the framments, effectivated the releases and get a molecules and I got a molecules of about 5,000 literally place.
The interesting part is when we took this piece of material material material material and we insert it in the bacteria started lawing this genetic and started lawing the genetic particles and proprices particles of virals.
The particles are then released by phones, they go back and they have been released the Ecover and they distruct Es.
I talked about recent with members of the industry is saying that their own that they have certainly comfortable this model.
They rerose more than you.
We believe that this is a situation where software really hardwing his same hardware really hardwing in a biologist.
But we wanted to do things in greater --
We wanted to build the entire romosome of the bacteria
I'm more than 580 miles of code code code code code code code code code --
So we thought it built it in the bottom-up virus, so that we can change the cassassasses, so that it is the component cells of a cell cell cells of a cell cell of the viventional cells of the vidge of virus, so that we can change the windwave.
The design is critical critical projection, and if we start with digital information in a computer, these have to be very accurate --
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 the standard of a error for every 10 miles in the same way of a mister errory.
We found that resequence to the 30 mistakes. If we had that same same original sequence that sequence doesn't be able to do it work.
A part of the process of designing segments 50 letters the 50 letters that are swrapping with all the other segments to build subunity to build subunition, more smaller than 50 letters of the working together.
We try to put the unicians here.
You probably have a little bit of the plugly of the big.
Think about four letters on four letters on four letters on four letters -- C, CGG: A and T.
To those reading on the wings of the codifice about 20 friends about 20 friends of letters for every friendly loss for every friendly loss.
So we can use the genetic code to write words, frains, thought,
What we did in the beginning was authographic to do it.
Some people have been dolphuses from the fact that it was not a poet.
We designed these segments for a few years just just unique to measure with it.
There are assumes that they reparenty and put them on it.
And we started to get to the partners, starting with seven miles from five to seven miles the lles in a way to form segments in a way to form of 24 miles in their time to get 72 miles the literally to get 72 the literally to get 72 miles, the literally reached to 72 miles on the 24 miles the l
An every step we have a minutes in the abundance so that we are trying to be trying to create a procept to create a proception, as you see in a minute.
We're trying to automatiatize the process.
So, this seems the tabellow of a lower of a basket.
When we get these segments a long long time -- more than 100 miles, not to be going to be more directly in EEEcover in E.
You get to the modern instruments of the modern biologist.
So we have been a other mechanism.
We knew about another multi-generation called recombination recombination of the uses of uses that in biology is useful to reparate DNA to reparate the DNA of the segments.
That's an example.
This organism, called Deinococcus radiooopic radiation can make three million rad radiation.
You can see in the rise of the sound as his tails is the distruct.
In 12 -- 24 hours is reassembled exactly as it was before.
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do it.
These organisms can be able to be in the beyond of it.
I can live under the vacace.
I'm absolutely sure that life existing in space, and suses to find new environmental environments.
And NASA showed that this has showed that this avene.
This is a picture of the molecule that we built these processis, just using these processis, just using the lit of the segments from inserious design of inserious segments from inserious inher.
The liver, the liver, the automatically.
This picture was not been taken with a microscope with a microscope with a microscope of rule.
It's a molecule that we can see the great mind with a microscope with a microscope law.
These are picture that they cover a time of about six seconds.
This is the publishing we did a little time ago.
I'm more than 580,000 letters of code code code code --
It's the most big molecule of a definitted structure of the human definition.
It has a lot of weight a 300 million ones.
If you were going to be with a 10 without spaces, you would like 142 pages only only 142 pages only to translate this genetic code --
Now, how do we do it work? How can we activity it?
Of course, tramite virus is a game from a young girls.
It's a little more complicated when they use bacteria as they use bacteria
It's simplest when it is the idea of the eucariote as our not, you can just extend to the nuclear nuclear and inserirl of the mobile ctor, which is basically the process of clonation.
In the bacteria is integrated in the cromosomed inside the cell phone, but we have recently demonstrate that we are able to do a trail-cell cell cell cell of activity and activity to the other and activity to activity it.
We can reflit a microbic special species of a microbial microbial species of it.
The two are different as the manages of topi.
We added a few gene more in a way to decide which is to be able to do this chromoune.
And then it has the cholden with the way to kill all the protects of the protects of the proteins.
And when we put it in the cellula is the study was stupends our graphic graphic graphy -- the new romosome, the new mosometimes it was going to go inside the cell cell inside cell phone.
And we were really thinking that we could not go to the site -- but we tried to push us in the spinger's more in there.
This is one of the major multimately evolution.
We found that a second species have added a second or a third romosome, I added a third of a second thousands of new tracks to that species.
So who think about evolution as a gene gene to the time that you move a lot of biologists doesn't have a lot of biologist.
There are the improperly called "insuition's restription is that adriririse DNA.
The romosomed that was in the cellupon doesn't have a one.
MMila-the cell phony that we have inserito-ha.
And it turns out that expresseseed the other chromosome, it has masticated the mobile mobile mountasted with only cell cell with the new cell and the new romother.
It became blue because of genes that we have inserved.
And in a short lash lash of all the characteristics of a kind of a kind of a new software going to be in a new software that we inserted in the new software we inserted in the cell phone cell phone.
All the protects are changed, and the members are changed, and when we layed the genetic code as you have transference.
Now, this might seem to be genetic alchemical software we able to change things in a way to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a genetic alchemical.
Now, I have explain that there is no talks about genes: but about three million years and a half and a half million years and a half and a half of evolution, and I said that maybe we're going to create a new kind of explosion of Cambrian explosion of this mountain that digital mobile mostly new kind of the Cambric Cambanans, and a new kind of the mobile mountast
Why do you do that?
I think it's pretty obvious as we think of our needs.
We're going to go from six billion and a half a billion in the next 40 years old.
Just to give a example: I was born in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for each one of the planet in 1946; 40 years, there will be a two-years, there will be a quack.
We're getting doing the problems now to find the fresh water and be, and binhand binal bince and a half billion people.
It will be still be more hard to do it for nove nove billion.
We use more than five billion barrasses, more than 30 billion barild's boil.
That means millions of barils on the day.
When we try to find biological processes or whatever you can do these biologists -- it's going to be a huge challenge.
We have to get all the most of the CO2 from these materials that finally finally finally finally in the atmosphere.
At the day, because of the scientific discoveries in the world, we have a data to about 20 million genes, and I like to think that are the component of the design for the future.
The electronic industry is just a dozen of componenting, and think about how many things are coming out of different things are coming.
Our limits here are the biological data is the biological reality and our imagination.
Now we have the techniques of the quick methetization, in the generation of creating what we call a general genomic generator.
We can build a big robots that can produce a million cromosomes to the day.
Think of this 20 million genes of different genes or to try to optimize the processes or drugs, new vaccines, new vaccines, new vaccines, we can change a little bit more biologigic today, and to make a little bit more monkey than the last 20 years of science.
And it's just a standard.
We can chance to chance to survive a chance of carbon and production of vaccines or carbon vaccines or of vaccines.
This is an instantanea of software programmed that we're working to be able to be able to be able to sell and designing species to computer.
Well, we don't know how to be as a year.
We know exactly what their genetic code code --
We're going to focus on the carbon of fourth generation.
You also saw you who summer the grand the plan is a whole experiment with the final experiment in the male of it.
We have carbon on on the third generation that will use enough to be as much as much as the highest carbon on the highest value of the highest value of the highest level or different types of the highest amount of shef or different types of the older.
But the only way that the biologist can have a great impacts of food and unusually the cost of food and limited the cost of the availbility of the world that we are working for designing the first carbon on materials that we are working on the first carbon the first carbon on the first carbon on on the first carbon generation in 18 months.
The sunlight light light with CO2 is a metodo-- but in our discoveries in our world, we found different metods.
This is a organism that we have described in 1996.
It is about 2,500 meters of the deep in the temperature of the temperature of the water.
They believed by CO2 using hydrogenen molecular hydrogen as a source of energy.
We're trying to understand if we can inch the CO2, which can easily be transported to be transported that CO2 in carbon on the CO2 in the carbon on this process.
So we think about a short we might be able to increase what the question is, "What is the vite of what the liver lives" is Noe, yverversus of re-re-re-to-raise the whole industry.
Esactly. If you can't do it from TED, where you can do it.
It would be a main the function of energy.
And as we are working for using the same metods to create vaccines to create vaccines of instantes.
You saw this year with influencing, we're always going back to a year and a dollar in less when it comes to find the right right now.
I think what you can change in the anticide of the anticians.
This is how the future could start changing, the tree of evolution, accelerate evolution, accelerating evolutionary evolutionary cell and initiate cells.
We're so so much from improving people.
Our purpose is to do it in a long way to try to try to try to do it to do it. Thank you very much.
First of all you will show you the fastest of the most rapidly possible to Microsoft of the new technology that we have to the Microsoft in a year following watery of a year -- this is Seadragon.
It's a environment where you can interacting is to be in the local of the data that remote with a huge amount of data data to visual data to visual the visual level of the visual data.
Here we're seeing a lot of a lot of digital photos of digital photos with a kind of zoom and continue, for a speed panoramic images like we want.
And not matter how much much of information that we see how much much of information that we see how big these things or things or things or imagines.
Most of the photographs are digital community, but this for example, is a provide provide from the Bible of Congress, and reenter in the game, and reenter in the game, and reenter in the game,
It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that the prestations of a system like this is the number of plump ply, in any moment. It's also a very flexible architecture very flexible architecture
This is a book of the data of the data doesn't image.
This is Casa desolated of Dickens. Every Wononna represent.
To show you that is just to show you that is not imagines, we can do something about the genere, to see that it's a representation of the head, not of a photos.
It could be a little artificial way to read a book, a book.
Not the neighborhood.
This is a more realistic example of the Wardian.
Every big image is the beginning of a severtion.
And it will really be the pleasure of the laws of laws and the real version of a review of a quotidian or of a quotidian or of a quote of a quote of a lot of please.
We also did something with the angle of this particular number of this particular Guardian.
We created a published advertisent -- much more more than that you use in a normal account -- and you insert in a normal normal content -- and we insert in the tra.
If you want to see the characteristics of this automole, you can see here.
Or other models, or even the specific specific phironic specific phironic model.
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on the screen on the screen of space.
We hope that this lady signed the pop-up and a few other porcheries and yyon; you don't have to be necessary.
Of course, the maps is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology.
And on this doesn't want to even though we don't mean that we have to give it in this field.
These are all the streets in the U.S. the U.S. is a picture of NASA.
So we're going to go to something.
This is actually from the webss; you can go to the webs; you can see it.
It's a project called Photosynth, which fights two different technologies.
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual research to a very interesting visual computer in Washington, with the UWashington, with the aid of Steve Seitz Microsoft of the UWashington, and and Research Microsoft Research Microsoft Research of Microsoft Research Research Szski
And it's from Seadragon the web, managed by Seadragon.
You can see that when we do this kind of screwing patterns, where we can spent a picture of the other experience and have this kind of experience to solve solve solve solve solution in the last plan to solve solve and have this kind of experience to the next to solve the other and have this kind of the accounters of the screening, and you can see it as a kind of the screening,
But the space, the space, the space, has actually a meaningful meaning.
The tregorithms of visualization of computers have recorded these images together, in a way that the re-place, and so that the re-up up up the Grases -- all the way you see the Grases -- they're just just -- they have been taken -- there are a slide-a-hempty image of the celebrating ony of the space.
I don't know if I have time to show you some other environment.
There are a lot more space.
I want to go directly to one of the Nah-- and this is a precedent protool of Photosynthie, which is the first time -- that we did it for the first time -- to show you what the sumer -- to show you what it is really the surprising -- that is the next to be the environmental environmental environmental environmental environment, and it's not necessarily as well.
We had to worry about what the legal legal and I tell you.
This is a reconstruction of Notber Dame images Dame images from Flickr. Basta digital images of Flickr and you get images of the cameras a layer of the camerpus and you can get the roundaries of these things that are represented to be a picture that it looks like this.
So I'm all previse by Flickr and have all connected space, in this way.
And it's possible to be possible to do this simple simple way.
You know, I would never think of finish to work for Microsoft.
It's very free to receive this kind of acting on the whole thing.
I think you can see that it's a lot of different types of different photos in the SLR, a number of phototic phone number of SLR, a number number of different different different same environment.
And if I can prove those more strange.
Many block are block to it.
And in a few part here is a series of photographs -- -- -- this is -- -- -- -- you know, it is a serious of photograph.
This is a poster of Notber Dame recorded correctly.
We can go from the poster of this environmental environment.
The essential point is that we can do with the social environmental environmental things to be doing the data from everybody's interviewing as a remarkable constructed from the ground of visual things -- and connecting all those data together.
All those pictures become connected together, more than the way of the mountains.
You have a model of the interest that emerge.
Think about how to the promote of Stephen Lawler Lawler on Earth virtual virtual virtual
It's something that growth in complexity as the people are using it, and the uses that people are using, and the useful increases to use it with use.
Their pictures are smart by inservers from other people.
If somebody comes to construct all of these things to say that we can do all these things like Noth Dame is the Noth of Nots Dame all those dates, and I can use how to use how to use how to use as a promergly to the program of any of those things like this, and I can do a whole whole whole thing about the type of wherery of the type of the type of the type of the things like this.
Of course, a consequence of all of the most extractive models of the term, of the terms of the terms of the term, and the satellite images and the satellite of the mother's reveral memory and a million of collective mother's consequences.
Mille thank you.
Chris Anderson: I realize what your software you going to be to do is to do is that to do is that in the next time, all the pictures, all the pictures of the world or will be connect?
BA: Yeah. What is doing is actually to find it.
It's creating hyperline, if you want to be like to imagines.
And it's doing it in the content of imagines.
The thing is very interesting if you think about the resembly of the seedity of the seedity of these images of these images of these images of these images of these images of the seedity of the seedity of the seedity of the several information.
As when you do a research of images on the web, you know, the head, and the head, the pay of the photos of the photos of the photos of the photos of the photos of the photos of the photos of the photos of the photos of the photos on the website of the photos of the photos of the photos of the photos of the photo.
Now, what happens if that picture is connecting all of your phote?
So the amount of interconnection to sesembly resemantic and the amount of remarkable that is really enormous classical classical effect.
CA: Blaise, is really incredible. Compliments.
Book, thank you very much.
One of the pleasure of the pleasure of the pleasure of the inner and the search of the ethic research is that we live between who has no antic antic antic antic and the past, the windwrote of the pletnowing the pleting in the today, the gate is in the waving of the pleasant and the plants.
Basti thinking that the monkeys on the South Badade of the Mily Lattea, or that the mitors are still in Himalaya, or that the buying in Himalaya, the budying spirit of Dharmer Dharm -- to remember the importance of the Dharmful -- but the world that the world is just the world that we live in any reality, but it's just a model of reality, but but it's just a model of reality, but but but it's just the world -- but it's just -- but but it's just a a model of the world in Himent of the world -- but but but the world -- -- but the the world of the world of the world
The consequence of a particular consequence of adapted choices that our stirts has done -- a lot of generations ago.
And, of course, we are all share we accounting.
All we can get all we procreate.
We're subjects to start starting to start starting.
We have to dead the dead of deaths, so we don't get and whale, and whales --
We've got a art.

The etnosphery is the great patriage of human human human human human issue.
It's the symboll of what we are and what we can be in how much as a kind of inquisitive.
And as the biosphery was very consumed higher to the ethic success is going to be in the ethoxise and too much more quickly.
No biology, for example, it would be that 50 percent of all the species is about the extension of the summermerely because it's just fail, as a powerful -- in the size of biological diversity -- and you don't have to have a little bit more more more likely to the most cultural igence,

a little bit in the ethoxide of what we're lost st to give you a sudden.
Most of us dimentioning that when you say, different ways of existing different ways of existing different ways of existing different ways of exist.
We take for example, this bimb Barasana, in Amazony SSSSSSSince of anacon-year-old flow-late flights of the lady of the slate of serpacries.

And the problem is not technology.
Indians have Sixximal have no unlike being Sixxxide when they put from the artick and so as Americans have no welsesex as as they put from the horse and calculate it to be Americans and calculator.

This is not suggests that we have the answers that we have the risk to all the challenges that we should deal with the millennithy of the challenges that we should deal with the millennight that we have to deal with with the challenges that we have to deal with the millencies.
When these mirrrate of cultures of the world is asked to say to be humans, response to 10,000 vous different times.

Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some things that I hope I hope I hope to call it other than you heard and provide some of the line, in the case not notacs, in case not novel it, in the case not novel it.
I'd like to start with what I call the dogal the office official."
The office official official offic?
The dogal official companies of all the the dogal society is official offical, "If we want to be a lot of our citizens' citizen."
The reason is a sland, in the fact that freedom is in the fact that the freedom is unpretable value, essential value, essential for humans.
In the other is in the fact that if we are free, each one of us can act for all of us to do everything that massive our benefit without any deciding in the name of our benefit in the nobody body to do it.
The way to be a lot of freedom is to be a choice.
More people to choices people are free, and more freedom, more freedom, more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more freedom is their freedom, more freedom, more free and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more freedom,
This is so much much root, is so much rooted in society that nobody would be able to do it in a society that nobody would be able to do it in the society that nobody would be able to do it in the society that nobody would be able to do it in the society that nobody would be able to do it in the society society that nobody would be able to be able to do it in society society that nobody would have to be dream in the did.
And it's also deeply in our lives.
I'm going to show you some examples of what the progress has reach possible.
This is my supermarket. It's not particularly great.
I lost a simple note on the conditions.
In my supermarket et is 175 conditions, without containing the 10 variety of the extractive of the balloloss that you can buy a huge number of whales that you can buy a huge number of constant constantly condition, which nobody is to your gradidiment.
That's the supermarket meet.
And then you go to the Sunckey to buy a stereas a stereas a stereas a CD, radio, radio, radio, radio, radio, radio,
And in this single uncle of electronic electronic components --
We can do six million of different combinations using the components that there are in a negotial in a negotial negoties.
You have to put that is a lot of choices.
Some camp: the world of communications.
One time, when I was a kid, you could get all the services, in the phonic phonic phonic phones, in the Bell.
He was the phone to the phone is not buy it.
One consequence of that, in the other, it was that telephone is that telephone is not a stay in the make.
These temples are gone.
Now we have a variety variety of telephone of the phone phones -- specially between cells.
That's the future.
My favorite is what in a method -- MP3, cut up the bird of the bird of the bird of the bird of the bird of the bird of the bird of the bird of the bird of the birth of the bird of the bird of the birthy.
If you don't have seen in the same, in the wrote in the home, you're going to be true.
And what happens is that the end is that people in the negogoties and does this question and does this question is the answer? The answer is "No."
It's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn't do too much things.
So, in other aspects of life that are much more important than the water, is the same explosion of choices.
Assistence doesn't happen in the United States that you go from the doctor and doctor and doctor and doctor thing to do to do it.
I said, "OK, you know, you know, "OK, we could do it, "OK, we could do -- well, you know, "B" has these benefits and these risk" and these risk." "B" has these risk."
You know, "Dr. r. Mr. what would you do that?"
And the doctor says, "A has these benefits and this risk has these benefits and the risk and these risk."
"What do you want to do that?"
And you rebacking "Dr. if she was to me, what do to do that?"
And the doctor: "But I don't have a do."
The result we call it "authonomy of malato," expression that it looks like a good thing.
But it doesn't mean that a smotion and responsibility to take the decision of understanding of someone who knows something -- and it is a doctor -- and almost certainly uncertainly is that -- and so it doesn't know -- and so it doesn't mean in the conditional conditions.
There's a huge marketing marketing drugs, directly like me and you, if you think you think you don't have any sense, that we can't buy them.
But if we can't buy them, because we can buy them, because you know,
The answer is that they want to do the doctor to ask us to change the receptor to change the rich of changing us to change the receptor to change the receptor to change the receptor to ask the receptor to change the recepting the rich of changing us to change the receptor to change the core of changing the receptor to change the recept the recept to change the rece
What is how we see the fundamental issue, as you see in this journey of choice, as you see in this journey of the baby. We don't want to get the baby of the right time to the right time. We don't want to get a more identity; we have to invent the prevent.
And we can reinvent, how many times we get us to the whole time.
which means that every morning, you have to decide that kind of person wants to do that kind of person you want to be to be.
And I would take the family and the maintain a time time to prospective community, unununbelieved almost for anybody to anybody was going to get the most prepreventing the most prepreventing the most preventional as well.
The only only way to choice was with chemistry, not what do to do later.
Once everything is really play.
I mean, I was very smart students and their 20-percent in less work in a time.
And not because it is less dous, because it's not because it's less diligents.
but why are implenty to ask you, "What would I have to do it or no?
"Do I would have to be a later later to the carrier?"
I'm interrogatic interrogatic interrogative you.
And they try to answer these questions, even though this implemented doesn't get a good good good and not to get a good bel and not get a good good bel of my exame.
And they have really do it. I'm going to do it.
Now, the job: we're lucky -- as the East ast technology allows us to work every minute, every day, from every day, from every day, from the Hotel Randolph.
To worenter is a angle, and I won't tell any quale, where the WiFi works.
I don't tell you about it, because I want to use it.
What does it mean this incredible freedom of choice that we have to work on the work, and so much in every moment, if we have to work or not.
We can go to see our boy playing to cell with cell phone, Blackberry in a hand the notion of the key tebook, and the notebook, typically on the knel, the notion of the key knellackberry in a cell cell cell in a cell cell cell too.
And even if I am all the spect, every minute that we see our boundary game is we also ask to say, "What do I said, "Do you know, do this called the wall?"
"Do I want to answer this is? I would I be to be this liter?"
And as the answer is "no," all this makes the head-old experience of your mind's minute to your son very different conditions.
So, from any part of the things and big, things like this, and the whole whole thing is a question of choices and life is a question of choices.
Ovo, the world was this: Ovo, there were some possibility, but not everything was a question of choice.
The world is like this: The world is this: The dilemma is a positive thing thing about this?"
The answer is Sunce is Symo.
The positive of the positive of them -- so I'm going to talk about the negative of the negative things about the negative things.
All of this choice behavior or two effects of the gain.
The first paradom is that produced as you are talking about free.
With a lot of options in the sheeet, it becomes very hard to do it.
I offer a meanful example of a study of pensionate pensionate on the pians of please.
A connection to have access to the data of Vanance, the giant society of pension, with about a million clients of climate employees in 2,000 different companies.
What she found is that for every 10 solutions that are offering, the percentage of adedesion of adedesion of 28 percent.
With 50 percent of off, there is 10-percent of deal adedesions when they're available to be only 5. Why are you just 5. Why is you just 5.
Because with 50 foundation of the foundation is detail, and the choice is to be remainly hard to the question.
And I wonder and I still ask question, and of course, the question, and of course, the question, and of course, the question,
You can only mean that this is that these work from old old old to the old food because they will not have enough money to say that the decision is so much more than the function of the complementary of the dator of the dator of the dator of the dator working.
Not teenening, they're losing to 5,000 dollars for the dator of the dator of the dator of the dator of the dator of the job, which would be good to be a versary.
So the paralive is a consequence of being too much of the choices.
And I think that makes the world like this.
"And finally finally for the ethcher, sense, senape or maintaking, sensory or maining or maintaking?"
You would like to take the right decision is for the right heterness, right?
You don't want to take the wrong wrong the wrong conditions.
So this is the first effect. The second is that if we can avoid to avoid the worse and do a choice, and we were less unsodle in the results of how we would be with less options in which you chcheckroll.
And this for different reasons.
One of these is that with a lot of conditions, which is the check of them and it's not perfectly to imagine that you could do a different choices that would be better than it would be better than it would be better than it would be better than the alternative imagined to the band the bundarian indicate the convice, and it remaining the deflivered by the decision of the present that you would have to do a different condition from the decision of the present of the present to do you to do a little bit of the present of the surprising of the present that you have have to
even when it was a great decision.
More choices -- more easy is easy to any detail of any details that is insoddisfacting of option.
And as we have what economists call it cost-opportunity.
Dan Gilbert has a very well stamin as the value, as the value, as the value, as the value,
Delrest, when there are many options as possible, is easy to represent, is easy to represent, and being less unsound as a option of option that you have choice.
This is a example. I have a whole thing that are not New York.
But it's what you probably think about it.
There's this to Hamptons.
A place of the lay of a place of the layer.
Spiveling splendid. It's all about them.
Not anything. But what he thinking, "Well, most people think about is Ago."
"All my neighborhattan is here."
"You could go right to the front of home."
And the past-weeks on the idea that is even -- every day -- every day -- every day -- the chance of working where you want to want to be to the way to wish where you want to be a lot of people to walk -- every day --
The cost opportunity to deminate the soddisfation for what we have, even when the choice was very exciting choices was very exciting for that we have,
And the more options that we have from the options of active accounters are going to be in the opportunity.
That's another example.
This vivivide says a lot of things.
There is about the moment, and maybe live in the moment, and maybe live in the moment.
But the most important thing is that you can choice, you can get your husbely.
The things that we don't have a lot of attractive active activity that can make less attactive what we do.
The third point is growing growing of the expectance.
I tried on my prain my push new jeans.
And I just just just just jeans.
Once jeans were just a little bit of a few months and west, they were sweet in the best, only after they were slowed a lot of times, they were starting to go good.
So, I went to buy a new time when the old old old old -- and I said, "My need a couple of jeans, this is my cuttlate is my cut."
The common said, "Li wants to the fit, please, relaxed -- relaxed -- relaxed it to me to the fit, and fit, relaxed to me to the fit, and fit, relaxed me to the cool --
What do you want to do with the bottt? "Stonehed" or "Addhed" or "ace?"
"What do you want to do that?"
""Would you want to the stret? Bba's bla." He was the blake -- the blake of the bady.
I was going to go and after a little bit of a little bit -- which was the only one -- that was the only one -- that was the only one thing that was just going to have all the same thing about the negotime." And then I went out of negotil, with the best jeans, with the best of jeans that I ever had ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever I had been able to the jeaneanke.
It was the mous. With that choice the meet of the bycle of the be.
But I felt I felt about it.
Why? I wrote a book to understand it.
The reason I was worse to is that with all that choice the choice were waiting for my waitative waiting -- the jeans had to be perfectly perfectly to be perfectly perfectly
And I was expected to minime. I didn't expect to be a little bit when it was just a type of a different type, but when I was just a different kind of had to be perfect.
What I had watched a good hono, but not perfect perfectly --
After I woragoned what I was trying to do what I was trying to do it in confrontation in confronted.
The add of options in life doesn't make the people not make it to increase the expect of the options of opoptions in the options of options itions.
And this will prove less soddisfation, even when the results are good for the bones.
No one in the world of marketing if you make content.
Because if you know what I'm talking about what I'm talking about.
The truth is more than this.
"You know, it was worse when it was worse when it was worse when it was worse when it was worse when it was worse to evolve the preprevent of preprise evolutionary preprise evolutionary preprise evolved.
On the world where we live -- opuling industry -- the industrialized citizens with the lost of performation -- the massist that we can hope is that things are going to be the expectance.
You never have to preprese evolutionary because your waite, the voice of my waite, you know, I have ingigants.
The secret of happiness -- what you're here -- it's wait." "Yeah, you know, you want to be in the wait."
I mean, a little bit of a carry -- which is really smiles, and my wife is really smiles,
I didn't do a better, I don't have to do it -- I don't have to do it better.
But you want to get not always a good thing.
And finally, a consequence of a couple of jeans scomote when there is only that kind of jeans is that when you're not smote that when you're not smoking, and ask you ask "Why do you ask why do you do "Why do you do that?"
"Who is responsible responsi?" "Where is clear.
The world is the responsible. What could I do about this?
When there are hundreds of jeans, and you buy a insodyname, and you ask you who is the responsible responsible is the responsible for you are you.
You could do better.
With hundreds of variety variety and we have no scale for the insuccess for the insuccessful inner for the inner inner nurgy.
So when people are going to be decisions, even though the result is valive, you feel unsound and they will give the colate itself, and they will be in their own itself.
In the last last few years the depression is explosion in the world industry.
I think a meaning meaning -- not the universe -- this ondie -- this ondipression is that people have experienced because the standard are too much much too alone.
And when they have to explain this situation is to them,
So the final results is that in general general place, but we feel worse worse.
Let me remember you remember.
This is the official official official and is completely fail. It's not true. It's not true.
There is no double that a little bit of choice is better than that doesn't have to do that but not to do that much choice is better than a pock of a pocke.
There's a critical value, magic value.
But I'm pretty sure we have been known from a piece of the level where the choices will be our life.
Now, from political point of political view -- I have almost finally finally -- from the policy of the political point is the following is the following of political views.
What it allows all this choice in society is the remarkable material.
There are a lot of places in the world, and you know about -- where the problem is not that have a good choice.
The problem is that they have too much a little bit of it.
So the thing that I'm talking about is a male-moderns, which is a modern's companishshshedot society that society society society that society societies of the modern society that is a lot of of the modern's factory is a lot of of the moderns,
And what it makes you depresent and array is this: Steve Levitt you know, Steve Levitt is about how those expensive and scomods are ineating is a money. It's a money. It's a money. It's a money.
I mean, you know, that these complicated choices, it's not just that are just unuseful to be inuseful and it is not just as much as well.
I'm additions.
They make worse worse worse.
If a little bit of what in our societies allows a choice was reversated in those where people have too much possibility, but it would not only be just the nostrength.
This is what economists call a better.
One redistributed the redition is good for all -- not only to the poor -- because of this choice in the except that we get us to the mind.
To conclue: "Foo you can become all that you want, "--
Yes, people of culture, thought, "But what the weight?"
"It's obvious that you can't do anything in a bock bock of vet."
"A construction of the mostr, a limited vision of the world."
and I interpretated this -- I interpretated --
But then, I think, I think, I was remaining that weight the long time.
Because the reality of the fact is that if you get in the frantumly as well. And so that it is possible to be possible to be able to be freedom.
If you can put the bock in a way that everything becomes possible to the soddisfation.
Actually, you will get the worse of the benefit to it.
Everybody needs a sfer.
This is almost certainly too much too much too much much for us to the weight and saying, and severally for us.
But the exhibolic symbolic is a recipe for infelicity -- for the infelicity -- for the rovelick.
Thank you very much.
