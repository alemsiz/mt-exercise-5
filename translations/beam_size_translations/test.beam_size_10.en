Part years ago, here at TED, Peter Skillman introduced a challenge of design called the marshmallow.
And the idea is very simple.
The four people have to build the most people have to build the highest possible that you can reduce it alone, using 20 spaghang meter.
The marshmallow must beyond in the top.
And even though it looks very simple, because it's pretty hardly difficult, because people to collaborate very quickly.
So I thought it was an interesting, and I incorporated it in a laboratory about design.
And it was a huge success.
And since then I organized about 70 labs of this kind of around the world with students, designers and architects, designers and designers and architects.
There's something in this exercise that reveals reveals on the nature of collaboration, and I'd like to share some of these lessons.
But, most people start with the orienting to orienting towards the compit.
They talk about, you imagine what it would expect might expect, they spend the power, and then they spend time planning planning, organizing.
They make sketches and prices.
From the most of the time to be assembling the spaghetti in structures and growing in structures and, at the end, just when the time is at the marshmallow, and they fly the marshmallow, and they falls it in the top, they do a step back and Ta-da!
They love the job.
But what happens is, most of the time, most of the times, is that the "Ta-day," because the marshed of a Uh," because the marshmallow makes the whole structure.
There is a certain number of people who have many more moments of the huh-oh moment, and the worst there are neolaureated businesses.
Mentono, cheat, you distragge, and they create absolutely transbal structurely transbal structure.
And there are naturally groups that have much more structures -- and, in the miles, there are the neodiployees of childhood.
And it's incredible.
As Peter says Peter, not just create higher structures, but they're also the most interesting structures.
And your question will be possible? What's possible? What do they have particular?
And Peter love to say, "No one of the kids spent time trying to become the Spage of Spage Spand.
They don't spend time competing for the power.
But there is another reason.
And the reason is that the economy students are formed to find the single best project.
And then I get it.
And after that, what happens is that when they put the marshmallow in the top, they have no longer, and what happened?
crisis.
It's familiar? Right.
What children are doing differently, is that they start from the marshmallow, and they build prototypes, one after the other, keeping the marshmallow, they have different chances to add prototypes.
The designers recognize that this kind of collaboration is the essence of the Iterative process.
And with any version, children have a feedback of what works.
So the ability to work on prototypes, but we see how they work different groups.
The average for most people are about 50 centers, for the economic students for economic students about the met, and a little bit better, but not much, children, better than many adults.
Who does better than everything?
Architd and engineers, because of the sky.
9/nine is the highest structure that I've ever seen.
And why? Because they understand that triangles and geometric models are the key to build structure.
Then we have the general directors, a little better.
But here's where it becomes interesting.
If you include an administrated, the group can make a lot better.
It's incredible.
Because they have particularly been able to again the altrure.
They understand it.
And all the groups that are running and pay attention to work better.
Does special and acagulation, and their combination bringing a safe success.
If you have 10 groups that are usually working well, you will perhaps six that will have structures.
And I tried an interesting experiment.
I thought, let's stopped.
I put it on 10,000 dollars in software prizing.
What do you think about design?
What was the result?
This is what happened.
None of the team has created a stable structure.
If one of them made a framework from 2.5 cities, she would brought the mile.
Isn't it interesting?
We tried again, the exercise with the same students.
What do you think this happened?
Now they got the value of a prototype.
The same team, from the worst has become the best one.
They created the highest structure in the minor time.
So they are important lessons on the nature of incentives and the success could you ask the time to write a marshmallow?
The reason is this: help create digital tools and make digital tools to help groups build cars, video games and visual effective.
And what a marshmallow is to help to identify the nose assumption,
Because, honestly, every project has his marshmallow, isn't it?
The challenge is a shared language, a common language, a common to build a prototype.
And so, this is the value of the experience of this simple exercise.
And those of you who were interested in, it can go to marshmallower challenge.com.
It's a blog where you can take a look at how to the marshmallow.
There are past educations.
There are crazy examples from all over the world on how people correct and travels the system.
There's also the world.
And the most importantly, I think, is that design is that design is really a sport.
It requires the footage of all the sense, and the useful of reasons, the feeling and manuality to run the challenge that has in your hand.
And sometimes a little prototype of this experience is everything that is needed to transform a "huh-day."
And that can actually make the difference.
Thank you very much.
We are finally going to have here a machine, beautiful car, in the TED stys at TED, is a time machine.
Everyone in this room have to get it.
You can go back, you can go a; you can't stay where you are.
And I would be curious to know what you would choose because I asked my friends in the last time, and they all want to go back.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I am convinced that there is a sort of come back to our algia, to the lights.
I understand it.
But I'm not part of that group, I have to admit it.
I don't want to go back, and because I'm not going to come back and why it is because the chance on this planet don't go back.
So I want to go into the car and I want to go on.
This is the best time that there was on this planet in every field that we can measure.
There has never been a period like this.
My grandfathers die -- everyone over 60 years.
My grandparents spent that number of 70.
My parents are to touch the 80.
So it's better than there is a nine at the beginning of my death.
But it's not just about people like us, is a much bigger than that.
A child in New Delhi today can be expected to live as much as the richest man in the world of 100 years ago.
Think about it. It's an incredible.
How does it be it?
smallpox. The smallpox killed billions of people on this planet.
He changed the demography of global war has never done.
If there's gone.
We have consciously.
In the rich world threatening millions of people only one generation does no longer exist.
Difterite, broad:
someone still know what?
Vaccines, medicine, our ability to feeding billions of people, these are triumples of the scientific method.
And according to me, the scientific method to try and things, see if they work, change when they don't work, is one of the great results of humanity.
These were the good news.
Unfortunately, they were the uniques because there are other problems, and they have been quoted a lot of times one of them is that, although everything that we've got, a billion people on this planet, every day.
This number is growing, with incredible rapidly, and it's very quickly true.
And not only we used our creativity to fill the planet.
Wather pockle, land far, rainforests and rainforests, oil; they're disappeared, and they are disappeared, and they are disappeared, and if we don't met our actions to pull away from this guy, disappearance, we also disappeared.
So the question is: can we do it? I believe yes.
I think it's clear that you can make food for feeding billions of people without violent the earth that they living.
I think it's possible to revive this world of energy without that this destroy.
I really believe it, and it's not an illusion.
But here's the thing that brings me the night -- one of the things that tend to me up the night,
We never had so need scientific progress as we need now.
We are at an incredible event.
But despite this, I think we should go to side, 300 years, before the Illuminism, to find a time that we fought the progression that we've fighting the progression that we are fighting the most fronts, than we do.
People are around, and they do it with a lot of the force that we can't liberate them.
Not the truth can liberate them.
Listen, everyone have right; they have right; they also have righted to the opinion, but you know what you haven't right?
You've got no right to your facts.
I put a little bit to understand it.
A decade years ago, I wrote a story about vaccines for "The New Yorker," a short article.
And I was astonishing that some opposing to what it is, after all, the most effective public health of all the human history of human history.
I didn't know what to do, so I did as usual, I wrote the story and I went to the way.
Not much later, I wrote a story about genetic food.
Same thing, just bigger.
People were crazy.
So I wrote a story about that, and I couldn't understand why people considered OGM like "mostrow," because they thought they move the molecules in specific ways, instead of case, instead of case, instead of case, rather than at the work of nature.
But, as I do my job. I wrote the story and I went on.
I mean, I'm a journalistic journalist: let's go and cended up there.
But these stories were tortured and I couldn't understand why, but I did.
The problem was that those fanatics that they were doing crazy.
They were consciousness, educates, people for good.
They were exactly how people in this room.
And the thing was disturbing me --
But then I thought, ways, we have to be honest on this planet, where we don't have the same relationship with the progress that there was one time.
We talk about the environment.
We talk about the ironic terms of using virgolds: "Progress," "Progress" good, there are reasons to do that, and I think we know what they are.
We have lost confidence in institutions, and sometimes in the science itself.
You just have to do just some names and people understand it.
Cnobyl, Bhopal, Challenger, Viox, the Challenger, Viox.
I mean, each one has his list.
We have questions and problems with people that were thinking about it.
So you sit skeptics.
Wake question, pretend answers, pretend to evidence.
Don't come up with that.
But here's the fundamental point: when the evidence are to accept it, and we're not very good at this.
And I think that the reason is that we are in a fear epidemic of that I had never seen and hope I don't share it.
About 12 years ago was published a story, a horrible story, a story between an epidemic of autism autism and vaccines.
Very frightening.
Those of studies were made to see if it was true.
And they had to do hundreds of studies; it's a important.
They came up with the data.
They came from the United States, from England, from the Canada, from the Canada, and all of them were equal, no correlation, no correlation, no correlation of nothing.
He didn't make it difference. Not because we think about anecdos, to what we see -- -- what we think we can see, to what we think about real feel.
We don't think of an documents from the government that show us numbers from the government that show us numbers, and I realized, I think we all understand it.
But you know what?
The results have been devastanted --
devastating because here's a face: The United States are one of the few countries in the world where the number of vaccines against the death.
It's horrible, and we should be about ourselves.
It's terrible.
What's happened that it took us to do something like that?
Now, I understand it.
Think of it, somebody here has the death?
Anyone in the audience has ever seen a death?
It doesn't happen.
In this country doesn't happen, but it happened 160,000 times in the world last year.
I'm a great deaths for a death.
But since it did not success here, we can take it from my head, and people like Jenny McCarthy can go around and ignorance and ignorance from palcoscenes like Oprah Larry King Live.
And they can do it because they don't understand the difference between causality.
They don't understand that these two things seem to be equal, but I don't know.
But it's something that we need to learn, and we need to learn it fast.
This man was a hero, Jonas Salk.
He liberated the humanity from one of his flags.
No fear, no fear, no suffering.
The man at the center, not higher.
It's called Paul Offit.
He's just created a vaccine against the rotabus together to other people.
He saved 400, 500 mile mile in the developing countries in the developing world.
But, right?
It's either, if it wasn't that Paul goes around to talk about vaccines, it says how praying and that people should just stop.
And it tells it in these terms.
So Paul is considered a terrorist.
When Paul talks about an audience can't testimonce.
They call it in home, because they like to remember that they know where his children go to school.
Why? Because Paul has created a vaccine.
I wouldn't need to say that, but the vaccines are fundamental.
If we stopping them, terrible disease, and it's going on.
We have the deaths in this country.
And it's going to be worse and not a lot of the children will begin to die again, because it's just a lot of number.
And they're not going to die of death.
Can poly? Right. Why do we do that?
A colleague of the college had written a couple of weeks ago, and he told me that I thought was a little over.
No one had said before.
She wouldn't vaccinated his son against the poly.
No.
OK.
Why? Because there's no polio from us. But you know what?
Yesterday, we didn't have the polio in the United States.
Today I don't know -- perhaps a guy is salion an airplane in Lagos and is coming to Lagos Angeles, now is in Los Angeles, now is above the Ohio.
Maybe it's going to have a couple of hours, it's going to see a car, it will come here in Long Beach and stasage to one of these fantastic coaches from TED.
He didn't know it was infected by a paralyzed disease, and we don't know it because it's how the world.
This is the planet in which we live in. We don't do it until it is.
We address circumstances. We love it.
Do you have all the livamin?
Echinacea, a little bit of ancient to start the day.
I know you did it because half of Americans do it every day.
They take that stuff, as they affect the alternative medicine, and no matter how often we demonstrate that they are useless.
The data demonstrate data.
They have the smaller urine. More than that.
But it's good, you want to spend 28 billion dollars per urbin school, they are with you.
Urina school.
Why do we do that? Why?
I think I understand the great drugs.
We have the great government machine. We don't trust it.
And we do good. Our healthcare system.
It's cruel to millions of people.
It's absolutely, incredibly cold and death for those of us who can afford it.
And so we get away and away from who we refugee?
We're now in the big placebel.
It's cool. We love the great placeb.
You know, it's a serious problem because this is a slavery, and we spend billions of dollars.
I have a whole series of examples here.
No one of thize -- a from, echinacekeeps -- a from. I don't know what it is but we spend billions of dollars, and it's a from.
You know what?
It makes you good."
You know, you have a little bit.
Because I'm not interested in whether it's the secretary of the Department for the Salute and the Uhm,
When we push the street that leads to to replace science and evidence with magic and tradition, we end up in a place where we wouldn't be.
Let's do it as Thabo Mbeki in South Africa.
He killed 400 miles of his conitizens continuing to say that barbabetes, celines work better than some of the anti-retroviral drugs.
There was hundreds of thousands of inutilized deaths in a country that has been brought over every other than this disease.
Please don't come to tell me that there are no consequences for these actions.
There are seed: There are always there.
Now, the most stupid epidemic that we are in half right now is the war of the genetically mountain of the genetically modified foot of the genetic food.
It's an idiot. It has got to end.
It's a diatridge on the metaphor.
It's ideology, it's not science.
Every single thing that we eat every chick, every chick, every leaves of the Bruxelles was modified by man.
You see, there were no sent in the garden of the Eden.
There were no melance.
There were not even the Christmas.
We did it over the last 11,000 years.
Something worked and something else.
And we have eliminated what I didn't work.
Now we can do it more precise.
And there are some of the answers.
But we can put things like vitamin A in the rise, and it would help millions of people, properly.
And we don't want to do it?
I have to tell you, I don't understand it.
We are contrary to the OGM.
Why?
The things that I feel always like chemicals, pesticides, pesticides, pesticides, we don't want to be huged with the same thing, it's wrong.
We don't want the companies to put a short of life.
We don't want the companies are unique.
You know what's my response to this?
It's yes. You've got right. Let's do something.
It's true, we have a huge food problem, but it's not science.
It has nothing to do with science.
It's light, morality, lines on the short of the shortvessels.
You know that science is not a corporation.
It's not a country.
It's not even an idea; it's a process.
It's a process, sometimes gives you positive results sometimes no, but the idea that we should not allow the science of doing because we fear is actually very lab, and it's actually very lab, and it's getting millions of people.
You know, in the next 50 years, we're going to produce 70 percent of food in more than we produce 70 percent.
These are investments in Africa of the last 30 years.
Vergous.
They need and need us and we don't do it.
Why? The genetically modified.
We don't want to encourage people to eat slavery.
A billion people eat.
It looks like a little path.
But provides just calories.
It has no nutrient, it has no proteins, but scientists are finding the way of inserircelles right now.
So many people could eat and run less the risk of becoming blind.
They wouldn't be famous, and you know what?
It would be very beautiful. It wouldn't be a restaurant, but it would be very beautiful.
I'm going to ask yourself, why are we count?
I mean, let's ask ourselves, why are we obstacking this thing?
Just why don't we want to move the genes and there?
It's about to move genes. It's not about chemicals.
It's not about our obsession for the ormons, or our desire to have greater food.
There is no Rice Krispies.
It's about rescue of people, and it would be now that we start to understand what it wants.
Why do you know? -- if we don't understand it? -- if we don't understand it, and we continue to change how we're going to do something that I don't want to be clear with clear colonialism technology.
There's no way to describe what is going on.
It's egoist, it's horrible in front of us, and we have to stop it.
So, after this very fun conversation conversation, you could ask myself, "You still want to get in this range of time and go to the future?
Yeah! Of course I want.
It's blocked on the present right now, but we have an incredible opportunity.
We can get the machine of time as we want.
We have a chance to go where we want, and we're going to really where we want.
We have to do these conversations, and we have to think, but when we're going to be happy to do it.
I know that we can say, as much as I think that the world needs to be.
Thank you.
Thank you.
On one day the Los Angeles Steve Los Angeles Steve Lopez was walking around the roads of Los Angeles when she heared a beautiful music.
It was from a man, a man, a human-American man, fascinating, fascinating, with the marcats, without dimore, he played a violin that she had only two cors.
I am telling a story that a lot of you know, because the articles of Steve evening a book, which, in the following of a book, which, in the following, with Robert Downey Jr. who interpreteding the part of Steve Lopez, Jamie Foxisist in the Nathaniel Anthaniel Anthithaniel Anthithaniel Anthithaniel Anthaniel Anthield Ayarard, which was interprety,
Nathaniel left the Juilliard, had a terrible nervose, and 30 years later, and 30 years later in Los Angeles.
I encounter all of you read Steve the book of Steve or look at the movie to understand not just the beautiful link that created in these two mans.
My name is Jane McGonigal. I'm a video game.
From games from 10 and my obbietary for the next decade for the next decade is to try to make the world the world in the real life;
To do that I have a plan, and consists in convincing more people, including you, you spend all more time playing games and interesting.
We spent three billion hours a week playing online.
Some of you might think, "It's a lot of time spending play."
maybe too long time, considering how many problems we have to solve we have to solve in the real world.
In fact, in my research, I pressed the Istitute for the Futuro, actually is the contrary.
Three billion hours a week are not enough.
In fact, I think that if we want to survive the next century on this planet we have to increase remarkably the number.
I have calculated that the total we need is 21 billion hours of play every week.
It's probably an idea a counterintuitive, so the repeat, so the repeat, to repeat.
If we want to solve issues, poverty, climate change, global climate change, global conflics, obesity, I think we need to play online, for at least 21 billion hours at least 21 billion hours to the end of the next decade.
This is why. This image reassume because I think to play is so important for the survival.
This is a rate of the Phil photographer Phil Toldan, wanted to catch the emotion.
So he photographed of players.
And this is an emotion.
If you are not abitual players of this picture.
You can probably notice the sense of urgence, a little bit of fear, but also an intense focus, a very deep attention to deal with a very difficult.
If you are used to play some details, you know some details around the eyes, and around the eyes, and around at the eye are optimism.
And the skulls sarrate show.
This is an abitual player at a step from something called a "Victoria Epic."
Ah, it's a term that you've already heard.
So we have the abitual players between us.
A life: A life's an extraordinarily positive that doesn't seem to be able to when you don't open.
It's almost beyond the shock of the imagination, and when you get is a shock to find out what you're really doing.
This player is at a step.
And this is the expressure we need to see about millions of resolutions of problems in the world as we deal with the next hundreds of the next hundreds of annininights, it's a step from a torial torepic.
Unfortunately this is the expression that we see in all of the days as we deal with the urban problems.
This is the expression that I call "I'm not Bram." And I'm going to do it.
I am with the "I'm not Brently Realtyalty."
This is a graffh in my old neighborhood of Berkeley, in California, where I did the PhD in the real life.
And this is a lot of players. And this is a lot of players that we are in the games.
And I don't mean "bravi" just as "succeed," even though the succeed: we get more results in the online.
But I also mean "braves" in the sense of motivated to do something important, inspired to collaborate and cooperating.
And when we are in a world honline, I think many of us becomes the best versions of ourselves, the most capable of helping without previous performers to be able to focus on a problem for all the time.
And in the real life when we face a failure, when we deal with an obstacle, we often don't feel like this: we feel anxiod, we feel anxiod, perhaps depressed.
We never try to do this feeling as I call, just not existing in a game.
So this is what I wanted to study at university.
What is that in an engaging us to feel that we can't get any out?
How can we transport those feelings from games and apply them in the world.
So I studied games like World of Warcraft, which is really the ideal environment to solve problems.
And I began to notice some things that make the epic that so possible in the online.
The first is, when you looked in one of these games of online, especially in the World of Warcraft, there are a lot of different characters that make a mission to save a mission to save the world.
But not qualsia: a perfect mission, a perfect mission in your game. Right?
So you can complete.
They never give you an impossible.
But it's the limits of your skills. So you have to make it seriously.
But there's no disock in World of Warcraft, you don't spend the time to turn on the chickens, there's always something specific and important to do.
And there are many collaborators.
Anyway, hundreds of thousands of people, ready to joining your own epical mission.
It's not so common in life in the real life, this feeling that we have a lot of collaborators.
And there is this epical, this narrative, this narrative that inspire, because we're there, and what we're doing.
And then we get this feedback positive --
You've heard about increasing levels of force, and one in intelligence.
We don't get that kind of feedback in real life.
When I leave this stage I'm not going to have a talk about the audience, and you have a bizarre in bizarre ideas.
I don't get that kind of feedback in life.
Now, the problem of collaborative environments like World Warcrafty is that it gives so much religion to a step from a victory, all of the moment, that we decide to move all of our time in these games.
It's better than reality.
That's why of the World of Warcrafting all players from Warcraft, they spent 593 million years to solve the virtual problems of Azeroth.
This is not necessarily a negative thing.
But let's put it in perspective: 5.93 million years ago was the time in which one of our ancestors.
That was the first primary.
OK, so when we talk about how long we are investing in play, the only way we are investing in play, just to think about it, it's an extraordinary thing about the human evolution, which is an extraordinary thing -- because we found that we're changing all this time to play, we're changing what we're able to play more and more heart. We are evolving to collaborate more and having more heart.
This is true, I believe that.
Think of all this interesting statistics.
It was published by a researcher to college Mellon.
The typical young average today in a very strong cultures, it will have spent 10,000 hours play online, will have spent 10,000 hours play online, at the age of 21 years.
10,000 hours is an interesting number for two reasons.
First of all, for the children in the United States 10,080 hours is the exact number of hours that I spent from the fifth if you're present all of the day.
So we have a whole way of education of parallel education in which the young people learn how to be bad.
And some of you have probably read the new book of Malcolm Gladwell, "Fuorlasse."
If you did it bed by his theory, the theory of 10,000 hours for the success.
It's founded on a very good research in the cognion, that if we are dedicating 10,000 hours of the fruiting at 10,000 hours in that fields of 21 years, we're going to be the genes in that field.
We'll be good at that something as the best people in the world.
So, what we now have now is a whole generation of young people who are the genes.
So, the question is, "Exactly, what they become good at these toys.
because if we could figure out what this is going to have a amount of human resources.
This is the number of people in the world.
These are our genes.
500 million people who are extraordinary.
And in the next decade we're going to have another billion acabitual players that are extraordinarily good at that something.
If you didn't know it, this is what it expect: the video game industry is developing platforms developing platforms that will grow power and work with the cellular network instead of players all over the world, particularly in India, China, Brazils can be wonline.
The estimate is a billion players in the next decade.
This will bring us to 1.5 billion acabitual players.
So I started thinking about what these games are transforming us into genes.
Those are four aspected. The first is a very good urgent urgy.
Okay. Think about it as a remarkable form of self-motivation.
A optimism is the desire to act immediately to deal with an obstacle, with the conviction of having a reasonable hope of success.
The abitual players grow always believing that a life life is possible, and the worth of trying to prove this --
The abitual players are not with hands.
The abitual players.
There are a lot of interesting interesting research, how we find more people after played with them, even though they brought us.
And the reason is that it takes a lot of confidence to play with someone, we trusted their time with us, that they will game.
So, playing together with the legames of the cooperation.
The result that we really have more robust social relationships.
Right.
You know, there's one reason for the World of Warcraft player in the World of Warcrafting 22 hours.
It's why we know, as we are playing, that we actually are happier working soon, rather than relaxing or losing time.
We know that we are optimized, as a human, to work something that has meaning.
And the abitual players are willing to work very expensive, if it is assigned an adapted.
Finally, a meaning.
The abitual players adorange to be associated with wonderful missions to the planetary stories on planetary.
For example, an information to help create a context.
You know all Wikipedia, the greatest wiki Wikipedia,
The second wiki greatest wiki wiki is about 80,000 articles is the wiki of Warcraft Cin' Five millions of people use it every month.
They have more information on World of Warcraft in the Internet, that on any other topics in the world.
They're building an epick.
They are building a source of Warcraft.
OK, these are the four superpoters that together.
The abitual players are individuals of great super-power.
These are people who believe of being capable to change the world.
The only problem is they believe that they are capable of changes but not real.
This is the problem I'm trying to solve.
There is an economic named Edward Castrona.
Her studies are brilliant. It's just studiing the reason that people invest so much time, energy and money in the online.
He said, "We are looking at what constitutes nothing less an exode exode mass and online."
And it's an economy, so it's rational, and he says, -- I am not like me, I am a gamer of games are exuberant.
But he says that this is a perfect thing that this is a perfectly sense, because abitual players can get more in the world's online than in the real life.
They can have more solid in a game that not in real life.
They have a better feedback and feel more rewarded in a game that not in real life.
So, in the real world for now, it's perfectly reasonable for actors, spending more time in the virtual world in the real world of virtual world in the real world that this is reasonable for now but not in any ways, an ideal situation. We need to start making the real world more similar to a game.
There's an inspiration from something that happened 2500 years ago.
These are given antiches, facts of the peaking of a joysticks and cleaning wonders and very wonderful, wonderful. And they represent the first tools from humanity.
If you know the writers of the ancient Greek, Erodoon, perhaps you know this story.
It's the story of who invented games and why.
It was narra that games in particular, particularly the games of did, were invented in the Lidia, during one period.
So that caresty was so severe, that the Lide of the Lidia decided to do something unthink.
People suffering, the population was in revoltly, it was a revolution.
So, according to Erow; they invented a valid law a valida for all the rule.
One day, everybody would eat.
The next day everyone would be played.
And they dives so profoundly in the games of playing is so involved, and they diving us in a state of game game, that they ignored the fact that they ignored the fact that they ignored the fact that it has nothing to eat.
And so one day they did, and one day they eat.
And secondly, they spent so 18 years old, surviving the carestia eating one day and playing the following.
I think this is exactly the way we use games at the day.
We use games to do it in the real world suffering.
We use games to move away from everything that doesn't work in our real environment, from everything that doesn't work in our real environmental environment, and we get what we need from games.
But we don't need to stop here.
This is really interesting: Secondly, after 18 years after 18 years, the caresty was not going to improve, so the decise that they would play a last game.
They gave the whole gives in the middle, they played a dy; and the winner winner winers of that participate at an adventure.
They leave the Lidia and went to search for a new land where to live, leaving the number of people to survive the number of people to survive with the resources available, with the hope to bring their civilization from some other hand, where you could prosperate.
It's a little bit, right?
But Recently in the DNA have revealed that the Epusks that they would then brought the same DNA of the Lidia.
So that scientists have suggested that history suggested that history was a real story.
And geologists have found evidence of a cooling global cooling that almost 20 years and that could explain the caresty.
So this incredible story, it could be true. They could actually save their culture playing, refugees in for 18 years and then to be so inspired in the games for 18 years and then to be so well to save so much civilization to save so much civilization.
Okay, we can do it.
I call to World of Warcraft from 1994.
It was the first strategy in real time of the World of Warcraft. This 16 years ago.
They played by 18 years, we played in Warcraft for 16. We played in Warcraft for 16.
I say, we are ready for our epic game.
They would read half of the population in a new world.
This is where the idea of 21 billion hours of play a week.
We make the middle of us agree to spend an hour to play a day to play, until we solve the real world.
Istitute what you're asking, "How do we solve the real world problems in a game. Well, this is what I've been dedicated my work during the last last few years, I took the Istitute for the Futuron for the Futur.
In our Palo offices. We have this stending that express our idea of how we should relate with the future.
We don't want to try to predict the future.
What we want to do is -- the future.
We want to figure out from the best results and then we want to make the chance to transform them actually concret.
We want to imagine victories for epic that then gives people the tools to make them.
I'm going to show you very shortly three games I realized and I'm an attempt to give people the tools to create victors in their future.
This is "Monday."
We did this game in 2007.
It's a online in which you try to survive an oil.
The charge is not real, but we published enough material honline to believe that it is, and to live living the real life as if we were in the game. So, when you enter into the game, records in the game, you realize the kind of news that there are no news in time, data that show exactly the oil, the things that are not available, the things that are not available, the things that are available, the things that are available,
The impact on the transportation, if schools are closed, if there are revolved, and you have to think about how you lived your life if this was real. Dopodiches that we ask you to have a blog about it, to publish video, to publish --
We had this game with 1,700 players in 200700 players in 2007, and we looked at them from then for three years, and what I can tell you is that it's a transform.
Nobody wants to change the way they live only because it's a good thing for the world or because it's a good thing for the world.
But if you dive them in an adventure and says, "We don't have more oil.
This is an amazing story. This is an amazing story.
The same to see how you would survive.
Most of our players got the habits that has learned in the game.
So, for the next games to save the world, we decided to measure the world, we decided to measure higher, a biggest problem of oil.
We did a game called Superstruct, the Istitute for the Futuro, and the premise here: a supercomputed that humanity has only another 23 years on this planet.
The supercomputing was called "Sistema of Allerta Estination of the Global."
We asked people to reach wonline almost like a Jerry Bruckheimer's.
Bruckheimer, Jerry Bruckheimer, forming a team from the dream. There is astronauty, scientist, the galeot, and they all have something to do to save the world, but in our game, but in our game, but in our game, the future of resources the future of energy, the future of resources and the future of resources of health, the future of health, the healthy, the future of security.
8,000 people played for eight weeks, they have an incredibly creative solutions that you can find if you go online and try to Google "Superstruct."
And finally, the last game, the last game, it will start the three of the marze. This is a game Istitute of the World Bank.
If you complete play from the Istitute from the Istitute of the Bank, as the Social Innovator of 2010.
Againing with university shooted for sub-Saharan Africa.
There is a comic story of a comic level because of local ability, collaboration, sustainability, collaboration, sustainability and invented.
I want to invite all of you to share this with the young people, wherever in the world, particularly in the developing areas of the development, which may benefit from joined to start imagining of the world to save the world.
It's now to end up.
I want to ask a question.
What do you think is going to happen?
We all have these incredible players, we have these games that are the pilot of projects that we could do it, but no one of these has saved the real world.
Well, I hope that you will agree with me that the abitual players are a human resource that we can use to make the real world work in the real world that games are a powerful platform for change, that we have these incredible superpounds, a joyful productivity, the ability to be a social, this optimism and the desire of meaning.
I really hope that we can be meeting us to play games that have important, to survive on this planet to survive on this planet for another century, and my hope is that you joined to do and participate to games like this.
When I look at the next decade, of two things are unding: that we can make any future, and that we can imagine whatever we want, and we can play whatever we want.
So, I say, we start to games that will change the world.
Thank you.
For a few time I was interested in the placebo, it can seem something that a magic that a magician if you don't consider from my point of view. In other words, the point of view. In other words, the point to become something very real." In other words, the placebpills of sugar. In other words, the effects of sugar.
that what is happening is had to a drug or something like --
The pain of pain, for instance, if you believe that they have a measurable effect.
Something becomes true for perception.
I want to show you a magic rodimental, very simple.
And I'm going to show you how it works. This is a trick that is present in all of the books for children.
I learned it from only Cub Scout Magic in the years.
I'm going to tell you and therefore I'll explain it.
And so I'm going to explain why I'm going to tell you.
Here's what happens.
The colcholer; you can examined; my hand, that you can examinated.
I'm just going to leave the kick, like that.
I was on my hand.
To be certainly coming out of my hand.
Now I string my wise.
And so you can see that you can ever go on.
And the purpose of this is simple.
I go to open my hand my hand, and if it's all all right, my southern magnetism.
Actually, remains so save that I can school, and the narrow.
Nothing goes on or down from my hand.
There's no trical. You can examinate anything else.
Ta-day!
This is a trick. This is often a baby.
which are interested in the magic because you can learn a lot about English this trick, even though metodologists is very simple.
Many of you in this room.
This is what happens to Tengo into my hand.
I say I'm saving my wrist.
to make sure that nothing coming from my man, this is a good thing.
The reason I'm keeping the argument is because this is the secret of illusion.
In the moment my hand moves is moving away from you, this dit here, my indically, you move away from where it was in a position where it was so Bello!
There's somebody who's not had an childhood here.
It's like here, right.
And when I walk around me.
We can talk about why it is why you don't notice that there are only three fingers like that, because the mind, and the way that it process.
But that's not the point. Right? And when I open my hand, Of course, remaintaining not through the magnetism of the animal, but through their indict.
And when I close my finger, this movements when I go back, this movement covers the dit that comes back.
Let my hand.
It's a trick that you can do with your friends and neighbors. Thank you.
Now, what has to do with the placebow?
I read one studio, one year ago, a year ago that I brought me the mind.
I'm not a doctor or a researcher, where it was an amazing thing.
It seems that if you give a placebo in the shape of a white pill, just like an aspill, just a white pill, just a white pill, it has a measurable.
But if you change the shape and you give placebo, under the shape of a smaller, and blue color and blue color, blue color, and you printed a letter is visible.
Even though no one of the drug has a drug pills.
But a white pill, it's not actually as a blue pill.
You know?
But anyway, that's not here.
The capsule are more effective than any forms.
A capsule capsule, which is the yellow from one and red on the other is better than a white capsule.
The dosage has a role.
A pill, two times a day is not so effectively as three pills -- I don't remember the statistics.
But the thing is,
that these dosages have a role.
And the shape has a role.
And if you want the definitive placeb you have to use a needle.
Right? A syringe with something -- a couple of hundred of something inert.
you start it in a patient --
This is an image so strong in their mind, much stronger than the white pill.
This is real, this graphs -- I'm going to show you another time when we're going to have some slides.
The point is that the white pill, it's not as effective as that blue of the blue -- it's not as a doctor.
And no one of these has a drug quality.
It's just your belief that makes them in your copro and the effect.
I wanted to see if I could take this idea and apply it at a magic trical.
And to do something that is a final trick.
And we know from the studio that when you want an effect needle.
This is a seven chicken chicken.
The sterilip a little bit.
This is my carne. This is not Damian of Damian.
This is my skin. This is not a special effect.
I'm going to hole my skin and make this skin.
If you try to nausea -- if you feel easy -- I did it for some friends in the tree, the other night, and for some that I didn't know -- and a woman is almost seven.
So if you try to be easy, I suggest that you don't look for the next 30s -- actually, you know, I'm going to do the first part here.
You could see, you can look at another side.
This is what happens here, the beginning of my carce at the bottom of my arm on the bottom.
Sorry. I'm impressing you?
And now a little bit through my skin, and out of the other hand, like that.
Now, we're in the same position that we were with the knife.
More or not, but you can't count my finger, right?
So I'm showing up here. Here's one, two three, four, five, five.
I know what people when they see this.
Three of them, "You're not going to be so stupid to have some minutes."
So, let me leave you leave a clock.
How do you seed? Abast.
Yes, I know what I'm going to say "OK, I don't have seen it good."
People in the rooms are entrance.
Let me show it from neighborhood.
This is really my skin. It's not a special effect of Hollywood.
This is my carne, and I can turn it around.
Sorry, if you hear it from another part, don't look at it.
People in the bottom or that will be going to say, "You know, it's clear that provides some effect, but if it was true --
You see a hole here and a hole here, if it was the blood."
Well, I'm going to get a little blood for you.
This is here.
I normally now levers the needle.
I can see that there are no arm, and I would show you that there are no stops.
But I think in this context, and with the idea of getting something truth, and I turn it into something true, I would leave it in something really, I should go from the stage.
We're going to see a lot of times in the next days I hope you don't see the time. Thank you very much.
So, in my life I met a lot of fish.
I just loved two.
The first one was a passionate story.
It was a great fish weird, carnoous, consistent one of the most vending on menu.
What a fish.
What's even better than it was from an training standards of environmental sustainability of sustainability.
So, you feel like the consciousness in selling it.
I was involved in a relationship with this beauty for different months.
And one day, the head of the company called me and asked to talk to a dedicated event to a dedicated event with sustainability.
"Yeah."
This was a company that was trying to resolve what became an inimaginable problem for our chefs.
How do we continue to have the fish in our menu?
During the last 50 years we've caught in the marks in the same way we have taken on the rainforests.
The destroyed was tremendous.
90 percent of the big fish -- the ones that we like so much the tuns, the halikes, the shoulders are reduced by dramatically reduced of the number.
There is almost swimming.
So it turns out to us or less water, the water, the weight, the weight, it's going to be part of our future.
There are lots of argument.
The fish heavy heavy, for least the greatest part of it, and they are inefficiently.
A big problem is that there is that there is a 15 conversation.
That means that it takes 15 books of wild fish to get a book.
It's not very sustainable.
And it's not a big thing.
So here is finally a company that was trying to do it in the right way.
I wanted to help them.
The first day of the event I telephone day of the audience.
Camolar Don.
"Woman," I said, "long to understand you are famous to get so far in the waiting so far, in the open seases that don't inat."
"Eat," he said, "We're so far away from the coast that our shoes are diluits, not concentrated."
And then let's add a world to particularly a world to particular."
"The conversation? 2.5 to on."
"The best in the sector."
2.5 to one.
"2.5 to one thing? What do you are you to eat fish?"
"Proteam.
"Grande," I did. And I got the telephone.
The night, I was at bed, I thought, what the hell is a sustainable protein sustainable?
So the next day later, soon before the event, I called Don.
I said, "Doon, do you make some examples of sustainable proteced?"
He said he didn't know it, and he would ask him.
Well, I talked to a few people of the company.
I finally talked to the biology.
We also call him Don.
"Don," I said, "You do some examples of sustainabout?"
Well, he lessly mentioned some of the fish and then he said, "People of the chicken."
I said, "Doch of chicken?"
He said, "Yes, skin, pelles, sweats and sat and processed to eat."
I said, "Which percentage your eat me is made of chicken?"
I thought, you know, two percent.
"Well, that's about 30 percent."
I said, "What's the one of sustainable in the weight of the chicken?"
There was a long pause, and then he said, "There are just too many chickens on the world."
I told me about this fish.
No, not because I'm one of the virtuosis of the good food and traditional food.
Well, what it is.
No, I actually told me about this fish because, I'll go after that after the conversation, the fish knew about chicken.
The second fish is a different love story.
It's a romantic history that kind of story that you know the fish and more you know.
You eat it for the first time in a restaurant in the Spain.
My journalistic friend had talked about the fish of this fish.
There were basically meeting.
He went to the table color, he had a brilliant white color, almost scintilling.
The chef had too much.
It basically had to be cotted.
It was still deliptious.
Who is able to make a fish so good after you get the road?
I'm no, but this guy yes.
Can Miguel.
It's actually called Miguel.
No, she had no cotten the fish, and it's not a chef.
For the less, not in the sense that we mean.
It's a biologist in Veta Palma. The Palma that is a fish of fish in the western of the Spain the Western Western River.
And at the '80s was managed by the 1980s.
They were boven on what first was essentially a stage.
They were given the earth building a serious series of channel, so the water in the river.
Well, they couldn't make it work.
And from ecologic view, was a disaster.
He killed something like 90 percent of the birds, considering the place, it's a lot of birds.
So, in 1982, a company with an environmental company.
What do you do?
They reverse the flow of water.
Three terically, invertising.
Instead of consuming the water from the grounding, they used the channel.
They get all canals.
They created a 27 mile wallevening from 27 mile miles and diggs in this process, Miguel and Miguel and this process, Miguel company.
It's incredible.
I mean, you never saw something like this.
Look at the horizon that it seems to be far a million miles and everything that you see are the unlike canals.
I was there in Miguel.
It's an amazing three quarters Charles Darwin and a quarter Crocodile Dundes.
Okay? We were doing in the middle in the middle of this lagon, and I had the knee. I had the knee.
First indicates a nest white.
Then he explains the minerals of the fitoplankton then you see a type of fish bunch of the Tanzania.
It turns out that Miguel has spending great part of his career at at Mikume in Africa.
I asked him how it had become a fish.
He said, "Pestop? I don't know anything.
I'm an expert in relationship."
And the sounds after it still stands on the rares, algae and algae and strange water.
Don't get me very fascinated, this was very fascinating, that is, that is the natural community.
It's interesting, but I was in love in love.
And my head was continuing to rethink that delighty fish fish that I had eaten the previous evening.
So I interrupt and I said, "Miguel, what makes your fish so good?"
He indicated algae.
"I know, the algae, the algaes, the fitoplankton, the relationships.
But your fish what?
What's your conversation?
Well, I'm telling me how their is a wealthy that the fish is going to eat exactly what they would send in a wild environment.
The biomass of plants, the fitoplankton, is the whole zooplancton, is all that nuts.
The system is so healthy that will be completely.
There are no eat.
Have you ever heard about an allevening that doesn't give to her animal?
Miguel later, I was driving around the ground with Miguel and I said, "In a place like this that seems so different from any evening that has ever been seen, as you measure succeed?"
In that time, it was as if the record of a movie had ordered the change of the set.
We found the corner, and we saw a scene between the most incredible thousands of fenicotters and thousands of fenicotters of a rose rose that was lost at the eye.
"That was the succeed."
"Look at their pange.
They are bank you."
Banchecking? I was completely confused.
Dissi: "Miguel, but are they not banking with your fish?"
"Yes."
"We lose about 20 percent of the fish and the eggs of fishing birds.
Last year on this property there were 600,000 birds over 250 species.
It has become the biggest and one of the most important private health private for the birds in all the Europe."
Dissi: "Miguel, but a releaving population is not the last thing that you want to be in a fish of heaven?"
The head of the head, no.
He said, "We try to extentensive way I don't mean.
This is an ecologic network.
The fenicotters.
The range are eating phitoplankton.
So much more is rose the bread of fenicotters is the system."
Okay, so we reassume that doesn't give to eat to eat to his animals and that measure its success in his predators of his predators.
A lifestyle, but also a bird healthcare for birds.
Ah, by the way, those phenicotters don't even have to be.
They do the nest in a 150 miles where the conditions of the soil conditions.
Every morning, they fly for 150 miles in the morning and every night, they do another 150 miles for the back.
They do it because they are able to follow the white line of the A92.
On it seriously.
I thought something like Migueld of penguins so I looked at Miguel.
And I said, "Miguel, fly for 150 miles to the fly and then fly 150 miles of night for you?
They do it for their small?"
I watched a Whitney Houston.
He said, "No, they do it because the food."
I didn't tell you about the skin of my loved load that was delighted, and I usually don't like the skin fish.
I don't like embrity; I don't like rock.
It's that knowledge, like asphalty.
Not cooking.
And yet, when I took it into that restaurant in the southern of the Spain of the Spain.
He had a sweet and clean was like giving a dead to the ocean.
And I said to Miguel, and he annus.
He said, "The skin is like a city.
It's the last defense that whatever you enter in the fish.
It has evolved to hurity."
And then he said, "But our water has no impurity."
Okay.
A lifestyle that measure the success of his predators.
And then I realizing that when he says that the halling is not minimizing, very much the way because the water that fluid is from the riverse of the river is from the rivers of the rivers of pesticide, which brings tend to bring today, contaminants today, connecting chemicals.
And when it flows along the water and the water is more than when it's entrane.
The system is so healthy that clear water.
So, not just a training that doesn't feeds its animals not just a training that measures his predatory success in his predators but a leap of the water and not only for those fish and not only for those fish and not only for those fish and not only for those fish for you.
Because when the water, it goes in Atlantic.
It's a drop in the ocean, I know but I know the wealth, and so you would have to do that because this story of love.
You could say that it's a recipe for the future of the food is that you talk about the future of bovins.
So now we need is a radically new conception of agriculture in which the food has a very good knowledge.
But for many people, this is a little too radical.
We're not really passionate about food.
We are friends.
We love the marketing little farmers.
I love little familiar.
We talk about local territory.
I love biologist.
And when you say that these are the things that will make sure the future of the buster and says, "Hey, aley, even to me, "Hey, aley, even to me accions, but how do you can feeds the red world.
How do you think I can feed the world?"
Can I be left?
It's a question that I don't like that.
No, not because we produce already know more than enough to be able to feed the world.
A billion people suffer the fame today.
A billion -- most of how many people have ever been -- because of the enormous distribution.
You see, I don't like this question because it was determined the logic of our system for the last 50 years.
To look at the pesticks to the monocultures, chemicals, chemicals to the fish terrain fish and all this period of agricultural industry just ask, "If we can feed more people in the economic way, there is wrong in what we do?"
This was the motivation.
It was the justify.
It was the plan of business agriculture.
We should be called it for what a liquid industry in a liquid industry.
This is not agriculture.
Our panies today is not because of the forners in decreasing but for the resources of resources not for the last mechanics, but not for the last mechanics, but for the land stoptile, not for motorsis, but for the fresh water, but for the rainforests, but for the rainforests.
Do you want to feed?
Let's start ask, how are we going to feed ourselves?
Or better, how can we create the conditions that conditions that conditions to feed itself?
To do that, we don't look at the agricultural model.
This is an old model.
Everything on capital, chemistry and cars, and it has never really produced nothing good to eat.
We look at the ecologic model.
This is what matters on two billion years of experience.
We look at Miguel at Miguel as Miguel at Miguel and farm that are not only producers.
If I have to be truly better, they are better than I have.
You know, it's going to be good, because if that will be the future of the good food, will be delighted.
Thank you.
I grew up with an absolute diet.
I have to take a school, I have to take an hour and forth every day.
And I was always diving in a book, one book, a fiction book, which was brought to my mind in other worlds, and satives in narrative form, that unknowable sense of curiosity that I had.
And that curiosity was also in the fact that whenever I was in school that whenever I was out in school in the woods of samples, or snakes, or snaround, I would take them at the microscope, I was looking at at the microscope.
I was a real geek of science.
But it always was trying to figure out the world, understand the limits of the possible.
And my love. And my love, it actually seemed to reflect the world around me, because what was happening in the late '60s -- we were going on on the moon, we were going on on the moon, we wrote the depth of the oceans, Jacques Couau was in our rooms with his amazing documentary documentary that we wouldn't even imagine.
So, everything seemed to be giving my passion for the phenomenon.
And I was an artist.
I knew drawing.
And certainly there were no video games in my mind-generated films in the middle of the media, I had to create these pictures in my head.
From children, when we read a book, we all had to go through the description of the author, put something on the screen of our head.
And so, my answer was painting was painting creatures and alienes, aliens, robots, all this stuff.
At the mathematics lessons I was always stuck at behind the book.
This is because the creativity had to find a way in some way.
And it happened: Jacques Coustea's programs from Jacques Cousteau programs.
I would not go to a space world on a alien world on a space.
It was very unlikely to be very unlikely.
But that was a world where I could go to really, right here on the ground, right here on the ground, the richer and exotic of what I could imagine reading these books.
So, I decided I would become a 15-year-old.
And the only problem was that I was living in a little country of the Canada, at 600 miles from the closer to the close close.
But I didn't leave it up.
I put my father until he found a diving school in Buffalo, New York, New York, just passed the board of where we live in.
And so I got to take the certified in a bunch of YMCA in the winter in Buffalo, New York.
And I wouldn't have seen the ocean, for two years until we spent in California.
From then, in the last 40 years, I spent about 3,000 of the underwater, and 500 of these hours in the submergies.
And I learned that the depth of the ocean, even a little deep oceans, even the oceans of life that actually goes beyond our imagination.
The imagination of nature is without contained to our human imagination.
Again, I'm intimate from what I see when I do the dives.
And my love history with the ocean history continue, stronger than never state.
But when I picked a career, I picked a career, I picked up film.
It seemed to be the best way to concile this smany, to tell stories with the smania to create pictures.
And as a boy, I would draw constantly comic and so on.
So it was the only way to put together pictures and stories.
All back.
And of course the stories that I pick up telling was a phantom stories of "Earth" and "The Abys."
And with "The Abys" I joined my love for depth and the diving with a film.
So, I make the two passions.
The Abys" came out of something interesting that was to solve a specific narrative problem in that film, which is to create that kind of liquid water creature.
And so it was born the first character to the dead and animated to the computers that had ever seen in a movie.
And even if the movie didn't make a lot of money, I would say to malachievement, I had been testimony of something extraordinary, all the audience was hypacked by this magia.
You know, it's Arthur Clarke law.
They were seeing something magic --
And this was excited to me.
And I thought, "Fantastic, this is something that has to be adopted in the Chinographic art art.
So, with "Terminator 2," my movie movies, we went very far.
Frowing with the Industrial Light and Magic, we created the methal metal in that movie.
And it worked. And we have a new piga.
And we got the same result with an audience.
But we gained a little bit more with that movie.
So, by making a line between these two points of experience, I've come to the conclusion that this would have been a whole new world of creativity for the movie artists.
And I put a company with Stan Winston, my friend Stan Winston, who was the main Stan Winston, who was the main trick and designers in that period, and we called Digital Domain.
And the principle of the society was to leave the past, the analogic processes and so on, and you go directly to the digital production.
And so we did and gave us a competitive advantage for a while.
But we remaining half the '90s in the part of the design of creatures and characters, which is what we had the society.
So, I wrote this text called "Havatar" with the intension of the visual effects of the visual effects of the visual effects and realistic realistic realistic characters and realistic realists, and all the make-generated characters in computer.
And the whole has been given to mythy.
The kids of the society told me that we wouldn't be able to do it for a bit.
So, I have accanted it, and I did this movie of a big ship.
I did, I throw up there like a "Romeo and Juliit on a ship."
It would have been a story of epica, a passionate story.
Exceptly, what I wanted to do was to do was to see the back of "Titanic."
That's why I made that film.
And it's true. The studio didn't know it.
But I convinced them. I said, "We're going to dive into the reverse.
We will use it for the beginning of the movie.
It's going to be very important. It's going to be a great marketing ganut.
And I convincing them a expedition.
It seems crazy. But this brings us back to the imagination that creates the reality.
Because we really created a reality and six months later I found on a submersible Russian and a half of deep in the North Atlantic of the Northern Atlantic, not in the Northern Atlantic, not in a very high definition, but really.
I stays stop.
And it took a lot of preparation, we had to build Chinepredent and a lot of other things.
But I was remained by those dives, it was like a space.
Where everything was highly technical, and they were require enormous planning.
You put in this hair, you go down in this hairly environment, where there aren't hoping to be saved, that you can't go back behind it.
And I thought, "Fantastic. It's like to live in a phenomenon.
It's really great."
And therefore I was affected by the deep of the ocean.
Of course, curiosity, the scientific component.
It was everything.
It was curiosity. It was imagination.
And it was an experience that Hollywood didn't have to offer it.
Of course, I could imagine a creature and create a visual effect. But I couldn't imagine what I would see out of the oblame.
In our successive expeditions I've seen creatures with hydrothermal creatures and sometimes, things that I had never seen before, things that nobody had ever seen before, that actually wasn't even described by the time we saw and imagined.
So I was all from this and I had to do more.
So I took a curious decision.
After the success of "Titanic," I said, "OK, I put away from my work of Hollywood, Hollywood, and I do the explorer for a little bit.
So we started planning these expeditions.
We had to go to Bismark and exploring it with tized.
We went back to the back of Titanic.
We took little robots that we had created with the optical picture.
And the idea was to go inside and make an overwhelming inside of the ship, which had never been done.
No one had ever looked at the inside of the intilit. They didn't have the means to do it, so we created the technology to do it.
So here I are here on the bridge of Titanic, sitting in a submergible, observing the assumes that seem like this, where I knew that they played the violinists.
And I'm driving a little vehicle through the corridge,
When I say, I'm driving, but my mind is in the vehicle.
It seemed to be physically present in the back of the Titanic.
And it was the most surrecent experience that I've ever lived -- because I had before, because before you turn the angle I knew what it would have been for, first the lights of the vehicle the reveals, because I had the revealing film.
And the set was based on a repleasure of the model of the ship.
So it was an absolutely extraordinary.
And it really made me realizing that in the experience of the telepresence that you can experiment that you can experiment with these laws, the mind is injected in this other form of existence.
It was very profound.
And it may be a little bit of what could happen in some decade when we start to start having cybags for explorations or explorations or some other kinds of post-human futures that I can imagine, from a lover.
So, we did these expeditions, and we actually start to appreciate what there was out there there, as the open of the depth of the ocean where there were these staordinary.
And basically, they're aliens right here on the Earth.
They live in a chemosynthesis.
They don't surviving in a system based on the sunlight.
So, you see animals that live next to 500 degrees.
It seems even impossible to exist.
At the same time I was interested in space, again, a lot of time to the space, again, is the flu.
And I ended up in space, really engaged with NASA sitting in the board of NASA, planning missions, go to Russia, go to Russia, go to Russia, go to Russia, go to Russia.
It was fascinating.
But what I finished to do is to bring the space scientists with us in the tables.
And bring them down because they could have access -- astrobiologists -- astrobiologists, people interested in these extreme environments, bring them down and allow them down and allow them to see, take samples, testing instruments and so on.
So, we were walking from documentars, but we actually made the science, the space.
I closely closed the narrow of the phanteboy, to do those things for true.
And you know, during this way, I learned a lot.
I learned a lot about science. But I also learned a lot about leadership.
Everybody think that a recorder should be a leader, the chapter of the ship, or something like that.
I didn't know anything about leadership.
Why at a certain point I had to say, "What am I doing here.
Why am I doing that? What are you going for?"
You don't make anything to do all these spectacle.
Again. There is no famy.
People are thinking about that I went to the "Titanic" and "You've got to go to the chicken on some of the beach.
I did all these films, all these documentary for an audience.
No famy, no glorious, no money. What am I doing?
I'm doing it for the task in itself, for the challenge -- and the ocean is the biggest challenge that exists, for the bridge of discovery, and the layer that instaura when a small group of shape a team.
Because we were all with 10-12 people, working together for years.
Sometimes in the sea for 2-three months of movie.
And in that legame, you realize that the important thing is the respect that you have for them and that they have for you, when you finished a compit that you can't explain anything.
When you go to the earth and you said, "We had to do this, and the fiber eith, and the attention, and that all of the technology, the whole technology, and the whole technology, the whole technology, the most human aspects of the perfomance when you work in multiple -- you can't explain it. It's what perhaps they have lived something together and know that they never explain.
Create a wood, create a bond of respect.
When I came back to do my next movie movie -- which is "Natar" I tried to apply the same principle of leadership to be able to respect their own respect.
It's really changed the dynamic.
And so here I still here at one time with a small group, in an inexplored to do "Have with new technologies that didn't exist.
Thirreably emotional.
Tremendously engaging.
And we became a family, in four years and a half.
And it changed my way to make film.
People started saying that I took the organisms from the ocean and I put them on the planet.
For me, it was the essence of the way to do business.
What can we sweep?
What are the lessons that we learned about?
I think the first is curiosity.
It's the most powerful thing that we can.
The imagination is a force that can actually manifest a reality.
And the respect of the group is more important than all over the world.
Jupites come from me and they say, "Let's get some advice to do this."
And I say, "Don't limitation."
Other people will do it for you, you don't just do it by yourself.
And you'll be risk."
The NASA has always this sentence: "The errr is not contemplated."
But the mistake has to be an option in art and exploration, because it's how to make a vacuum.
And no important attempt that has been done without risking.
You've got to run these risks.
This is the thought that I want to leave you, that is that in whatever, the mistake is an option, but fear you.
If I wanted to understand one of the great idea that it would be the together of the data that we consume is greater than the sum of its parts, and that instead of thinking about too many information to emerging new relationships so that you can see new relationships so that you can see new training.
This is the statistics of death.
This instrument that use is an experiment.
It's called Pivot, and with Pivot I can pick up one cause of death, let's say the accidents.
And as we see emerging new relationships.
The reason is that there in the central part of the people are more active.
We can do a step back and reorganize the data for cause of death, we see that circulating diseases and cancer, but not for everybody.
If we go forward and filming for age, let's say under 40, we see that accidents are the cause of deaths that you worry about it.
All the closer to close close to humans.
So you have understood that visualize information and data in this is a little bit like swimming in a graphic information.
What if we can do with green data because we don't do with the content.
So here we have the cover of every Sports Illustrated every Sports Illustrated
All over here.
You can go into your rooms and try and try to try your own rooms.
You can see a decade a decade.
Or a specific year,
You can isolate one number.
So let's take the athletes that open athletes in this number, their sports.
I'm a Lance Armstrong, so I click here and I see all of the numbers where Lance Armstrong.
Now, if I want to give us a look at all of the cycling all the cycles?"
I do a step back.
And now I see Greg Lemond.
I mean, you will understand that when you navigate between the information in this closer or far from the neighbor, and it's not only one research, it's not only a research, it's not just browser.
But do something to read something different.
It's a half that according to us how we can use information.
We still deep this idea that it can seem a little crazy.
We took any individual page of Wikipedia and we reduced it to a short rewards that consists in a small lefty and an indicates the story.
I just show you the first 500 of the most visited on Wikipedia.
Even in this limitation screen we can do a lot.
You understand how tematic areas are the most visited on Wikipedia.
At this point, the government point.
We see this option we see that the Wikipedia categories of Wikipedia are the "Person" of the Anno" of Time Magazine.
This is significant because it's emerging something that in the Wikipedia is not there.
And you see it just by making a step behind the together.
If I take one of these resources I can zoom on the category of Magazine.
and see them.
At this point, I see most of the most of the government from the world of the world in the world of the business.
Here's my body.
One is from the music.
And rather interestingly, they also won a TED.
So let's save all the winning of my TED.
The first time we're really navigating in the network as if it was a network, not from page to a higher level.
I want to show you another thing that could surprise.
This is the New York Times.
Pivot, this application -- I don't call it browser, because it's not a browser, but it's not a browser, we add this technology for zoom at every Web, like this.
I can do a step back and I can come back to a specific selection. This is important because the only to see the pages web pages so I can see my navigation in the Internet.
I can zoom on what I did in specific moments.
So here you see the state of the demo that I just presented.
I can sort of see other things that I've seen in the day.
If I want to do a step back and see everything I can do with pieces my history or historic of my research.
And here I was trying to figure out the Bing, I tried the Bing, here for Live Labs Pivot.
And from here I can zoom on my page Web and just releasing from here.
A metaphor reused a lot of times, and in every case the result of the parts.
Today, in the world, the data are seen as a kind of sick.
It's about the overwhelming of information.
It's about analysis on the data.
And if we put things up if we put that if we put the web subject instead of passing from one thing to the other, we would be able to go from a lot of other things to be able to be able to see those structures that otherwise re?
And then instead of being trapped in data, we can actually extract information.
Instead of worry about information, we can pull out of knowledge.
And from knowledge of knowledge.
And with this thank you.
These are all talking about happiness.
I asked to count the number of books, the word "happinity" in the title and published in the last five years, they have reached to a 40, and there was a lot of more.
There's an enormous wave of happiness, between researchers.
There is a lot of the happiness.
Everybody wants to make people happy.
But despite all of this flow of work, there are a series of "cognitive" that somehow they make it impossible to elaborate ideas to happiness.
My talk about today is going to be about these cognitive traps.
And it's about people who think about their happiness, and it's about their own happiness, because they do happiness, because it turns out that we are confused.
The first of these trails is the reluttance to admit complexity.
It turns out that the word happiness is no longer an useful word as we apply.
I think that you can get to a particular meaning, particularly, but in the massive line, but in the massive line, and we have to address the most complicated vision of what is the "well."
The second trails is the confusion between experience and memoria: basically is to choose between being happy in life and being happy of your life and being happy about your life or happy about their lives.
And these are two different concepts of the concept of happiness.
And the third is the illusion of the focus is the illusion that we can't think of any circumstance that we can't think about any circuit without distorcern distorcern of the importance.
I mean, it's a cognitive traps.
and there's no way to do the right thing.
I'd like to start with an example of one person which, after a session of questions and answers, after my lesson, telling a story.
Not clear -- Disse that while listening a lefty of absolutely fantastic music right at the end of the recording,
And then he would add it very excited about the entire experience.
But it wasn't true.
What was broken about the experience.
He had lived the experience.
And she had heard for 20 minutes of the wonderful music.
But that I didn't count for nothing because he remained with a certain remind; the reminding was all that they remained it.
What this episode tells us is, in the bottom, is that we could think about ourselves and other people in terms of two themselves.
There is a discover of the experiences, that lives in the present and knows the present, and it's able to revive the past, but that basically has the present.
This is that it is that lives the experiences, and what the doctor, you know when the doctor, you know when I touch here?"
And then there is that it remainly remember, this is that it reminds the point, and you care about the history of our life, and it is that the doctor is that the doctor to ask: "How are you heard in the last them?"
or "How did you get your journey in Albania?"
Those are two different entities, the theme that lives an experience and what if you remember, and what if you remember, and the two is part of the confusion of happiness.
The mind is that remember, it's a dinner.
And this process begins with a fundamental response of our remember.
We don't only tell stories when we decide to tell them.
Our memory tells us a story.
Let me start with an example.
This is an old studio.
Which reports the experience of two patients during a painful procedure.
I'm not going to stand in detail. It's not very painful in today, but it was painful when this study was conducted in the '90s.
You asked the patients to get their pain every 60 seconds.
And here's the results for two patients.
Those are their result.
If you ask yourself, you know, the two-suffering.
It's a very simple question.
Carely, the Patient B has suffered.
his colonic colony wise, and for every minute of pain from the patient At the patient BB has suffered at least as A or more.
But now there is another question: "How about these patients think they are suffering?"
and here's the surprise: A Patient was the Patient was a very long time worse of the Patient of the B.
The colonic stories of colons, they were different given that one part of the procedure of the procedure is the way -- no one of these stories is particularly positive -- but one of the two is particularly the worst of the other.
And the worst is where the pain.
It's a negative story.
How do you know?
Because we asked these people after the colonscopies, and even at the time, there’s distance of time, there?"
and a lot of much worse for much worse for B, I remember.
So this is a conflict between the mind is that lives the experiences and the theme is that remember.
From the view of it is that lives the experience, is clear that B has been suffered most of it.
So, what you could do for the patient A, and we actually have clinical experiments and clinical experiments. And it was really done, and it could extend the colony of the Patient A maintaining.
This will cause a little bit of pain in the patient, but just a little bit less than before.
And by doing this for a couple of minutes -- the thing is that lives the Patient experience.
How do you call a story?
And this is true for the stories that are from the remembers for the stories that we invent what we call a story.
The final are very, very important -- in this case, the final has dominated.
So, the theme that lives the experience lives lives his life in a continue.
Do you have a moments where you live experienced and question: What happens to these moments?
And the answer is simple.
They are performed to say that most of the moments of our life -- for how I calculated them -- by the psychological present psychological present is about three seconds that means in a life, we count about 600 millions. In one month, we have about 600,000 the most of whom they don't leave that.
Most are completely ignored by the side.
And yet in some way you have the feeling that what happens in these moments of experience is our life.
It's the limited resources that we're spending as we are in this world.
And how to spend it, it seems to be relevant, but it's not the story that reminds for us.
So we have a theme is that reminded and a theme that live experiences that are fun enough.
The biggest difference between the two is how to treat the time.
From the view of the effort that lives the experiences, if you go in vacations, and the second week is fun as much as the first one, then the vacation of a week.
But this is not the way that it works.
The theme is that remember, one vacation of a two-week vagain because there are no new memories.
You didn't change the story.
And in this way, the time is the critical variable, the critical variaby that is that it reminds from the theme that lives the experiences.
The time has an limited impact on this story.
Well, the fact that it reminds the experiences is more than remembering and tell stories.
It's actually the thing that makes decisions because, if we look at a patient that has gotten, for instance, two different doctors and it's deciding which one of the two different doctors -- what he thinks of the two different doctors is what the medical remember, and that's going to be the doctory that will be a chosed.
The thing is that lives the experience has no voice in these choices.
In fact, we don't choose between experiences, but among the memories of those experiences.
And even when we think about our future, we don't think about our future.
We think about the future as a memories.
And basically, you can consider this situation, like a tyranny, and you can think of it is that remember, and you can think about as if it flies the experiences through the experiences of the qualizes that lives the experiences, doesn't need it.
I have the feeling that when we go to the vacation is often the case that you get in vacation in good at the service of our mind is that remember.
And this is a little hard to justify.
Now how about our memories?
This is one of the explanations that is given for the predomination.
When I think about that, I get a vacation in the Antarctica, a few years ago, which is one of the best vacation of my life, and I think relatively relatively of other vacuances.
And I probably went to thinking about that trip of that trip for three weeks to say, 25 minutes in the last four years.
If I ever opened the character with the 600 photographs of the journey, I would spend another time this is three weeks of journey that you translates an hour and a half an hour and a half an hour and a half.
Well, I could be a little bit later, I could be a little bit in my shoe consumption, but even if you made more more than that, one question.
Why do we take a lot of weight memory of the fish that we have experience?
I want you to think about an experiment with thinking.
Imagine that during the next vacations, you know that at the end of the vacation of the vacation of all the pictures will be destroyed, and you take a medicine for the amnesthesia.
Would you wrote the same vacation? And if you could choose a vacation, you have a conflict between two is and you have to think of how to solve it and you have to think of how to solve it and actually not so obvious, because if you think in terms of time you have a answer.
And if you think in terms of remember, you could get another answer.
Because we choose the vacation that we do, is a problem that puts us in front of them.
The two are brings of happiness.
There are actually two concepts of happiness.
So you can ask. How much is it does the experience?
And then you can ask, how happy are the moments in life of the switch that lives the experience?
And it's about -- happiness for moment, it's a complicated process.
What are emotions that are emotion?
And by the way, we are now able to be able to do a good idea of the feeling that lives the experiences over time.
If you ask about happiness is that remember, it's a completely different thing.
It's not how happy.
It's about how it satissy or comfortable is the person when she thinks about his life.
It's a very different idea.
Anyone is not to be able to distinguishing these two notions, it will not be able to create confusions in happiness, and I look at a bunch of student well-beared studies about happiness for a long period in this way.
The difference between happiness is that lives the experiences and the satisfaction of the scape that reminds has been recognized that over the last years, and there are now to measure the two separately, the Gallup has an institute on the last few years, and they have a mondial on what they think about what they think about what they think about their life and on their experiences.
And there were other studies in this direction.
So in the last years, we started to learn about happiness.
And the biggest lesson that we learned is that they're very different.
You could know how a person is satisfied with your own life, and still this doesn't tell you a lot about how happiness.
To give you an idea of the correlation is about 0.5.
What does it mean if you meet somebody, and I would say, "oh, his father is 1,80 month."
Well, you would know something about his height, but with a lot of uncertainty.
You'd always have a little bit of uncertainty.
If I tell you that somebody thinks his life is at eight in a scale from one to 10 10 10 you will be very uncertainly uncertainly uncertainly about how happy they are with their own experiences.
So the correlation is low.
We have a certain knowledge of what controls is happy.
We know that money is very important, the goals are very important.
We know that being happy is to be satisssssatisfacfacfacts of time with the people that full us.
There are some pleasure, but these are the mains.
So if you want to get happiness of the two of them is, you will end up very different things.
The conclusion of what I said is that we should not think about happiness as a substitute of well-being.
It's two completely different ideas.
And more, very quickly, another reason why we can't think about happiness is that we're not paying attention to the same things when we think about life, and when we live life.
So if you do the simple question about how happy is how happy people in California, you can't get the correct response.
When you ask this question, you should be happier in California, that in Ohio.
What happens is that when you think about life in California, you're thinking about the contradiction of California and other places, for example, that comparison is about climate.
Well, it turns out that the climate is not so important for the scape that lives the experiences and it's not very important to be that reflects that is what happy is going to decide how happy are people.
But because it reflects is that reflects is in charge, you might end -- some pottery, at the end, transfer to California.
And it's interesting to verify what will happen to happen to people who transfer in California, in the hope of being happily happy.
Well, the idea that lives the experiences is not going to become happy.
We know it.
But something going to happen. They think of being happier, because when they think they will remember how terrible it was time in the Ohio.
And they will think they're going to take the right decision.
It's very hard to think clearly about well-being and I think I gave you the idea of how hard it is.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: Thank you. I have a question for Lei.
Thank you very much.
When we were at the phone a couple of weeks ago, it took me that a interesting result that an interesting result that was the Gallup.
Is it something that thinks that we still have a few minutes?
Daniel Kahn.
I think the most interesting result we found in the Gallup in the Gallup is a number, that we didn't expect.
We found that, with reference to happiness.
When we looked at how the feelings feeling with the income, we discovered that at 60,000 dollars a year of 60,000 dollars a year, for Americans, on a study conducted campation of about 600,000 Americans, it's about 600,000 Americans, it's about 600,000 Americans, it's about a representative of 6000-dollar representative,
CA: 60,000 dollars a year, 1:60,000 dollars a year, people are unhappy, and they become stronger progressively stronger than that.
I mean, I actually saw the lines of lines.
Clearly, what happens is that the money doesn't buy happiness happiness of the experience, but the lack of money.
In terms of the other thing is, is that remember, it's all another story.
More money.
This talk not about emotions.
CA:
If people take it seriously, this discovery, practices everything that we have created, for instance, the politics, and so on.
Is it the chance that politicians and the nation in general, can they take a discovery as that seriously, and make a public political political politic?
DK: You know that I think you recognize the role of happiness in public politics.
The present is going to be slower in the United States is not doubt, but in the United States, it's becoming reality, and in other people.
People are starting to recognize that they should think about happiness when they think about public politics.
You will put a little bit and people will start to talk about if you want to study the experience of happiness or if they want to study the valutation of life that we need to start this debate.
As you think of happiness, it takes different directions to how you think about how you think that you think about the effort, you think about the theme is that it does experiences.
All this influence will affect politics, I think, in the 190s.
In the United States, they are doing the effort of happiness of the population.
And this, I think, will come in part of the next decade, perhaps two of the national statistics.
CA: Well, it seems to me that this argument will be there, or for less it should be, the most interesting political discussion to follow in the next years.
Thank you very much for the behavioral economy.
Thank you Danny Kaheman.
I'm going to talk about energy.
It may seem strange, seen that in my work at the foundation of vaccines and seeds, things to invent and giving the world to help the world to help the world to help the world to help two miles.
But the customs and energy, actually, are extremely important for this people, are most important for them that people who are most important for them that for everyone else in the world.
A worse means, for many years, loss of crops.
It's going to get too much please.
The things are going to change in ways that their fragile simply can't replace.
Which leads to famy.
So the climate camps, so they will be.
Even the cost of energy is, for them, important.
In fact, if you could leave the price of one thing, to reduce poverty, you would choose poverty, you would choose poverty, you would choose very long energy.
The price of energy.
And a progressiping civilization because of progress.
The carbon revolution.
And even in the 19th century we have a quick decline in the price of the electricity, the explain why we have refrigerators, conditional materials, we can create modern and do so many things.
So in the rich world is about electricity in an excellent situation.
But as the price scenes, for instance, we have to respect a new wine, the winner of CO2.
The CO2 is scaling the planet, and its equation is very simple.
CO2 emit causes a increase of temperature, which induces very negative.
I was on the climate, perhaps even worse effect, in the sense that natural ecosystems can't beat these quick changes and so they collapse.
The valuation of how much increases temperature because of a CO2, and like each of the two worst things the other, is uncertainly unexpected.
And there is certainly uncertainty about how denial negatives, but they will be extremely negative.
But I often asked the best scientists -- we have we really need to reduce emission?
We can't just reduce half or a quart?
And the answer is that, until we get to zero, the temperature will continue.
It's a great challenge.
It's not like saying, "Let's do a 3.5 truck.
It's not about a little bit.
It's about a zero.
Now, we put a lot of CO2 every year, over 26 billion tons.
About 20 tons for every American.
For the people of the poor countries, it's less than a ton.
The mondial average is about five tons.
And somehow, we have to make progress that bringing that amount of a zero.
Cemissions are constantly increased.
Only some economic changes have changed this tendency, so we need to go from increase rapidly to zero.
This equation has four factors.
It's a series of multiplies.
We have the amount of left, the CO2, CO2, who must be the population, the services on the right are the population, the services that in every average, the average, the average request by each of the service and CO2 emition.
We look at each factor and we see how we can get it.
Probably, one of these numbers have to get to zero.
It's wisdom algebely.
We see a little bit.
The first factor is population.
The world has now 6.8 billion people.
We go to the nine billion.
If we do a good job with new vaccines, health reproductive health, we can decrease it perhaps one of the 10, 15 percent, 15 percent, but here we record a increase of about 30 percent.
The second factor is services that we use it.
The understanding of all, the food that we eat the clothe, the TV, the TV.
They're wishable, and free poverty is to provide these services for almost everyone in the world.
And it's a positive thing that this number increases.
In the rich world in the rich, we probably could save and use men, but in the average, every year, this will several number.
And therefore, complex, the amount of services are going to be more than two.
This is a very simple example.
You have the illumination in your home, to make the company, but these guys, so they come and read their buckets under the streets.
How much of the efficiency -- the energy for service unit of service -- there are good news.
This factor is not increasing.
Thank you very different inventions, new ways, new ways of enlilightening, you can build differently, for a lot of services you can decrease considerate energy.
In some services you can reduce 90 percent.
There are other serving services, like fertilizers, or the aerial transportation where the margins of improvements are very, very nurse.
So, complex, in the best of the cases, the energy consumed in three to maybe six times.
But these first three factors reduce emissions from 26 -- in the best of the cases, maybe 13 billion tons.
It's not enough.
We look at the fourth factor, the far, the amount of CO2 emitition.
The question is, can we reduce zer?
If you burn the coal, no.
If you burn the natural gas is.
Not all the ways to produce today the electricity, to part of the renewables and the nuclear CO2.
So what we're going to have to do is to create a new system.
And we need "miracle."
Which is miracle I don't mean something impossible.
The microprocessor is a miracle.
The Internet, and his services, are a miracle.
People today.
We usually don't have a scadence, a given that miracle.
Again, you are at the window and something else.
In this case we have to drive speeds, and make a miracle in a very remarkable times.
I asked myself, how do this concept?
There's some natural example, some natural examples, demonstration that you catch the imagination of gent?
I thought about a year ago, when I carried nets, and people found it fun.
They were participate that in the world, there are people who live with mosquitoes.
This is my idea for energy.
I decided that to fly lights would have been this year my contribute to the environment.
Here of the lights.
I tell me that they couldn't even turn out from the board.
-- now, we can invent it like this, but they won't help.
We need solutions, one or a lot that they are, that work on the great scale and very reliable, and although it is exploring in many directions, I think about five minutes, I think that only five of them can be surprising effects.
I claim myth, geotermic fusion nuclear fusion, biofusion, biofuels.
They could also have some contribute, and if they can do more than I expect, but I'm really interested in that I'm going to have to work on each of these Chines, and not reaching to nobody, because all the challenges.
We are looking for the first fuel of fossil fueling fossil fuels.
And here our job seems simple, but it's not, and it's not is, and it's capture the CO2, after combustion, at the camp from the camp to the room, put it somewhere, and hoping that it remains.
There are the experimental technologies that catch 60 -- 80 percent of CO2 percent of CO2, but reaching 100 percent will be very complicated and will be difficult to get to conserving all this CO2.
The most expensive issue is still the long term.
Who's going to stop?
Who will have something that is literally billions of times more voluminous than any other kind of reframeful, like nuclear or else?
It's an enormous volume.
So it's a difficult problem.
Another source would be nuclear one.
But the nuclear is three big problems.
The cost, especially in the very regulated, is high.
The question of security of security, the feeling that nothing can go wrong, they can go wrong with human operators, and that comburible comburible does not use.
And how do you run down?
It will be able to reduce it, the concerns are so much of it.
People need to be skilled.
Three very much problems, so that you could solve and what you should work.
The last three of the bottom of five sources.
These are often what people often call "renewable."
And to say the truth, despite the great advantage of not to require a combustible combusty.
The first is that density density with these technologies is definitely inferior at that of an electric central.
It's about energy, and so many kilometers of square kilometers, of areas of areas of thousands of times more extended than a normal electric electrics.
So, these sources are intermitted.
The sun is not all the day -- not all of the days, and even the wind wind sounds.
Anyway, if you depends on these sources, you have to find an electrical energy even when the source doesn't produce.
Gred challenges us on the cost of the costs.
And on the distribution.
For instance, let's say this source is outside.
So not only you need technology, but you also have to do the boundaries with the outside.
And finally, the problem of accure.
To estimate the size of the problem, I analyzed all kinds of bacteria today, for cars, computer, telephones, any types -- I compared with the amount of electric energy in the world and I found that all the bacteria now in the world and I found that all the bacteria now in the world and I found that all about 10 minutes of all that energy.
So we need a big step forward, a 100 times than the approach.
This is not impossible, but it isn't very simple.
This problem is already when the sources of intermitting when the source sources, we say, 20 or 30 percent of the energy consuming energy.
If you put it on those sources for 100 percent, you need a miracle.
But how are we going on on this road? What is the right approach?
Is it a Manhattan? What could we solve the problem?
Many company, a hundred company, they need to work.
We need at at least hundred people in each of these five sectors.
Most of them, observing them, you would call it crazy.
And I think here, in a group of TED, many people are already working in these camps.
Bill Gross has several company, by which an eSolar, which a great technologies in the sun technologies.
Vinod Khosla is investing in dozens of companies that are doing great things and they have interesting, and I'm giving my support to all this.
Nathan Myhrvold and I are financing a company, following the way the nuclear road.
There were some innovations, the nuclear nuclear module, the nuclear nuclear nuclear liquid.
But from a long time, the sector is stop, that there are some good ideas around not so amazing.
The idea of Three is that, instead of burning just part of the uranium, U235, the one percent of the uranio available, we decided to burn U238, 99 percent of the urban idea, in a sense.
The truth about it for a long time, but it has never been adequately tried if it would work or not, because of modern supercomputers today, you can do a simulation and see that yes, with the right materials, it seems to work.
And because it gives the 99 percent of the uranium, the structure of the best costs.
They burn the scories, and they use as the fuels of the reactors of the reactors of today, that they become the problem that they become a several resource.
You consume the uranio as the combustation. It's a kind of chandela.
It's like a legacy of legacy that burns.
From the view of the fuel is solved.
This is a picture of a place in Kentucky.
This is the show, 99 percent of the uranium, which has been tolded the part of it as a fuel as a fuel.
Those are going to give the United States to the United States for centuries.
And by showing the water, with a economic process, there would be enough fuel for the rest of life of this planet.
So, a lot of challenges careful, but this is an example of the hundreds of ideas that we need to make progression of ideas that we need to make progression for the progression of ideas that we need to make the progression of ideas that we need to make progression of ideas.
How should we measure our progres?
What would they have to contain?
And then we provide the goal and then we value of the intermedia.
You've heard a lot of people talk about an 80 percent reduction for 2050, it's really important to get it.
20 percent will be produced by the poor and some of agriculture.
At that point, we will have to solve the deforestation and the production.
To get to 80 percent developed countries, including nations, including nations like China, will have to replace their electrical production.
The other question is, are we making this technology emission?
Can we practice in nation?
Are we spread?
It's an important aspect.
It's a key element.
Again, what would expect should have the pay of 20?
Even that should have the same two ways.
We should be implementing of efficiency to start getting reducing reductions.
We emphasize will be the total amount of CO2, and so the temperature.
But the vote in this material, do things that they don't really do large reductions, has only part, or lose to the other, which is the speed of innovation of new inventions.
We have to pushing these advancing progress, and we can measure the speed from the number of regulations.
Many good books have been written about this.
The book of Al Gore, "The choice, and that David McKay, "Sustainable Energy Without the Hot Air."
And these books are approaching the problem and create a context in which I want to do the debate.
Most things have to have to be contemporary.
So I have a wish,
A very concrete wish we invent the technology.
If I had to pick up a only desire for the next 50 years, translate the president of the country, the president of the country, the realization of a vaccine, which is not CO2.
It would be with the greatest impact.
If this wish, you won't make the sentence between thinking about short-term of the United States and the U.S. China, between the United States and China, between those two billions of those two billion people will be long.
What do we have to do, right?
What am I inviting you take the initiative and proceder?
We need a greater supporting research.
When nations come together in places like Copenhagen, they wouldn't have to talk about CO2.
They should talk about the innovation program of innovations, and you would stupidly invent in these innovative approaches.
We need incentives on CO2, the chap on CO2, the devices of the pollution.
We have to spread the message.
We have to make this more rational dialogue, and it must include the choices of the government.
It's a commitative wish, but I think realizable.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: Thank you.
Thank you. Just to know more on Earth.
first of all, can you give us an idea of the size of investment?
Bill Gates: Realize the software, to buy the supercomputer, assuming all great scientists, what we've been done, it requires only tens of millions, and even when we tested the materials in a reactor, to be safe to be sure that they work to dover, we're only going to talk about hundreds of millions.
The hard thing is to build the pilocal reactor billions, the authority, the place in which will be built the first example.
Once built the first one, if it works, if it works, it's going to be the Colombo, because the constants, the density of energy, they're completely different from the nuclear that we know today.
CA: So, if I understand this implementementupon the construction of a vertical serbatoio filled with nuclear fuel fuel fuel.
Then the process starts from the high and progression to the base?
BG: Right. The reactors, today, are reformed, many people who can not work, open, many people, many controls that they can not work.
Not good!
If the fuel is very inexpensive is very economic and you can spend 60 years and forgoats inside and forgotten all those complexity.
Rests there, burning for sex, and then it ends up.
CA: A nuclear plant for itself.
BG: Yeah. Well we can leave them, then you can put them in another reactor, put them in another reactor and burn them.
And we're going to start with the existing rewarding, now conserved by cooling or container in the container to the network.
They're going to be our first fuel.
So what was a problem of conventional reactors is going to be the fuel of the name, and the volume of the reflies will be reduced.
CA: But when I'm talking around the world of the potential of this technologies, where most of this technology, where you interest in his realization?
BG: Well, there's no place in particular, and there are all these interesting rules of transparency of everything that is definition, nuclear we're very interested in.
Our staff was in Russia, India, China.
I just met the Energia.
We talked about how this idea comes to the current at program.
They are optimistic. French and Japanese made of work in this field.
It's a variation about something that has already been done.
This is a substantial improvement, but it's a kind of reactor, so many countries have already built a speed reactor has already built a speed reactor.
CA: Again, what are the time and the probability that something like to do that?
BG: Well, for one of these projects warm; it produces energy, that doesn't cost, much energy, we talk about 20 years to design it and 20 years to build it and 20 years to build it.
This is the scadence that the environmental models.
Thirree if all the good, that it's not a very good question, it could easily easy to meet this goal.
And now, fortunately, dozens of companies in the sector, that analogy, if their research works, if the function of their plants.
And it's better if a lot of the solutions will happen, because at that points will reminate to a together of solutions.
It's necessary that at least one success.
CA: This is the biggest innovation of revolutionary innovations, this is the biggest you know?
BG: A revolution is the most important.
It would be even without the environmental wine, but the environmental wines, but the environmental wines make it much more important.
There are other innovators.
We don't know their job like this, but one is the modulare; a different approach.
There's a liquid reactor. It seems hard to do it, but perhaps they say the same thing.
So, there are funny fun, but the beautiful is that a molecules of uranin a million times more energy.
CA: And if it works, what do we do?
Wouldn't we be able to adow emergency to try and maintain temperature.
BG: If you find you in that situation, it's a little bit like when you eat too much, and you have a heart attack.
Where do you go to that point? You could need a surgeon or something like this.
There are all research on the so-called geoengineering, which are various techniques that are various techniques that would slow up 20 or 30 years in which to coordinate the action.
It's like to be an insurancative.
I hope you don't need it.
Some of them say that you should not even work in the polizy because you could stand eat because you could keep eating because the surgeon.
I don't think it's a choice, the importance of the issue of the problem, but now in the geoengineering of the geoengineering in the case that the event events in the case when the event events in the case when the event event events later.
CA: Clima-skeptically, if I had a phrase, like you could persuaderle persuaders?
BG: Well, unfortunately, there are different kinds of skeptical skeptics are very few scientific skeptics.
Some people say there's a negative feedback because of the clouds of clouds to dead the effects of warming.
There are very, very few things that you can only tell us that there is one probability on a million that you have a million that you have the main problem looks like AIDS.
You put a mistake now and you pay the consequences only later.
And therefore when you're taken out of a thousand emergings, the idea to make sacrifices that you can just see the results of --
I sacrifice junce.
Actually, the relationship of the IPC doesn't make the word; there are people in the rich world that looks at IPPC and says, "OK?
The fact is that that uncertainty should take us to action.
But my dream is that, if we can make it economically, and to respect the wins on the CO2, then the skeptical skeptical skeptics, I don't care about CO2, almost I would like an emittate because it's more economic technologies.
CA: Would you have this response to the Bjorn Lomborg, that if you invent all the energy and try to solve the CO2, your other goals, your goals, your other goals, your goal are going to be sacrificated?
BG: Well, the effect in research and developing --
We say that U.S.A should spend 10 billion in more than they do now is not so far.
Don't be destinate resource resource resources.
The things that behaviors are very much money and here may have been reason, are funded to have anti-economic solutions.
To me is mostly.
Unless you are finding the curve of learning the curve of learning at the point where it will become very inexpensive efforts are focused in technologies that have focused in technological technologies that have the potential to the costs.
If the alternative, "We make the expensive energy, so that only the rich can afford," all of the present can afford the power five times as much of life.
The disaster would be for those two billion.
And Lomborg has reviewed his positions.
His now "Why are you not argument about Rember and Sviluppo?"
For his past again collects between the "skeptics, but I understood that is a bunch bunch of the Ricer's and Switch.
And it's a question that I think it's appropriate.
It's incredible how much uninvesting in research and development.
CA: Well Bill, I think about the most of the audience by saying that I hope to see your desire to become reality. Thank you.
BG: Thank you.
I want to share with you a discovery that I made a few months ago when I was writing an article for Italiana Wired.
I always have my own dictionary about my hand every time I write something, but I had already ended up the article and I realized that I haven't ever in my life tried the word "disable" to see what I was going to find.
Let me read the result.
"Disable," age: damamamaged, adjunated, indifenious, stop, stop, stop, stops, mutiled Indebold, mutiled Indebold, died, consumed by the surround, Senile, painted by the circulation, painted by the surround, shed by by by the circulation, wils.
Contraries: In form, strongful.
I was reading this high-voice list at a friend and at the beginning, it was so ridiculous, but I had the word mutilated my voice, and I had to stop, and I had to stop, and I had to reach me from shock and the impact that the top of these words have left me.
You know, we're talking about one of my old dictionary.
I'm thinking, it's going to be an old away.
But, from the early 80s.
when I was starting in school, and I was forming and learning what there was out of my family, and learning what there was my family and the world around me.
And I was useful, thank God I wasn't using using the dictionary.
I mean, from this explanation seems that I was born in a world that sees like a one that has nothing positive in any way for them, when they are celebrate today, they are celebrated for opportunities and the adventure that my life has approached.
So, I'm immediately going to see about 2009, in the back of the 2009, waiting me to find a review.
This is the update version.
Unfortunately, it's not very better.
I find the last two words under "contrary" -- particularly uncomfortable and "health" and "health." So, it's not just about the words.
is what we believe when we met them with these words.
is about the values behind these words, and how we build these values.
Our language influence our thinking and our vision of the world and how we see other people.
In fact, many civilization civilization, including that Great and that Romana, believed that it was more powerful, because it was more powerful, because they say things elevated.
So, what do we actually want to exist, one person who is limited, or an force?
So, casually doing something simple as a nomine of a person, a child, we could put the taps and throw on their force.
Would we don't like to open pores for them?
One person who opened me the doctors, was the doctor of where I was the Dupont in Wilmington, Dupont in Wilmington, Delaware.
His name is Dr. Pizzle.
Italy, the U.S. which, which was too difficult to take for most of Americans, so it was too a doctor P.
And the doctors was always frapillon colored and she had a perfect clink to work with children.
I was essentially anything about the time I spent in the hospital, with the exception of physical syotherapia.
I had to do what they seem infinite repetitions of exercise with these big elastic fases, in different colors -- you know, to help me build the muscles of legs.
And I hate these elastics more than anything.
I hate them, I got sick, really odid.
And you know, I knew already about, like a five years, with the Dr. P to try to get away from these exercizes, Inudge.
And one day, one of my seat, Stanancans and inesorables, these sites.
and he said, wow, Aimee, you're a child, I think you're a little girl.
"When the pull, I'm going to give you 100 dollar."
Now, clearly it was just a little manufactors to make me exercises that I didn't want to do with the perspective of being the richest girl, the richer of the second piano, what he did has done, it was to give a different form to an horrible routines.
and I turn it into an interesting experience for me.
And I'm asking today, the entity of his vision, and his deployation about me as a girl, she redefined my vision of myself in a stronger and athletics to person the future.
This is an example of how adults.
But, in the example of the vocabulary of the vocabulary of the synones, our language, we don't want to evolve towards the reality of an individual.
Our language, it wasn't the shift of the changes of our society, many of which they were created by the technology.
And of course, from a doctor, my legambs, the operations to leave the laser of the titanium and also retrouble for the bodies that are helping people to cooperate with their skills, and you move over there of the skills that nature has imposing the implementement of social networks, allow the people to be able to description of the networkers to identify networks.
So, perhaps the technology will be revealing us clear what has always been a truth, that each one has something to rare and afford to our society, and the human ability to adapt is our greatest quality.
The human skills of adapting, is something interesting, because people have always wanted to talk about difficulty difficulty, and I have to love it.
This sentence has never gone right, and I always felt in the response to people about this -- and I think I'm starting to understand why.
is subject in this phrase, insormonty, is the idea that success, or happiness, is the idea that succeed or happiness, is to emerge from the other side of a challenge of this experience, if my life in life has come from a ability to skiller or circumstances.
However, we changed, we have changed, logically, from a challenge, physically or mentally both of them.
And I would suggest that it's a good thing.
It's not an obstacle that is not an obstacle that we need to start our life.
is part of our life.
And I get to think it's like my shadow.
From a lot of time -- and sometimes nearly for nothing, but it's always with me.
And, of course, I'm not trying to decrease the impact, the weight of a person.
There are adversities, and the challenges in life, and it's true and relative to every single person, but the question is not if you had to deal with it.
So, our responsibility is not just to protect people to us from the adversity, but to prepare them in the right way.
And we do a damage to our children when we feel that they're not ready to adapt.
There's an important important difference and distinction between the objective medical factory of being a present person and the subjective opinion or not.
And in fact, the only disability consistent that I had to deal with is if the world has ever thought I could be described by those words.
In our desire to protect those that we love by giving them a cool trute, truth to their prognoys; really, the prognosis of their lives of life expectation of their life expectation in a wall of fact that it will disability.
Maybe the existing model of looking only at what there is roof in and how to put it in the place, it can address more the subject that disease itself.
Not one person in the complete, not to understand his potentiality, we are creating another disease in the natural suffering.
We are actually giving a vote to the value of one person in our community.
So we have to see through disease and human capacity.
and, much more importantly, there is a relationship between those insufficide and our great creativity.
So, it's not to propose, or negative, or negy, these numbers of research as something that we want to avoid or purpose under the carpet, but rather to find those opportunities crops in a accident.
So, perhaps the idea that I want to explain is that there is not what you can get an adversity, as it opening up to it, to use a term of free, maybe even by using a term of free, maybe even dancing together.
And perhaps if we look at an accident like a natural thing, and we are fewer than his presence.
This year we celebrate the two-birthday of Charles Darwin, and it was 150 years ago, when I writing about evolution, that Darwin has illustrated, I think, the truth of the human character.
To tell it in another way, it's not the most strong of the speech that survives, and it's not even the smart, is that the more you adapted to change.
The conflict is the genes:
Darwin work of Darwin, between other things, we can recognize that the human ability to survive and development is driven by suffering.
So, again, transformation, adapting, is our greatest quality.
And perhaps finally, we don't know what we are doing. We don't know about what we are done.
Maybe this is what it gives us.
So, we can do a giving us.
We can re-imagined adversity as something more than the harder.
We may see it as a change.
The adversity is a change that we haven't still adapted.
I think the biggest adversity that we have created is this idea of normal. Now, who is normal. Now, who is normal?
There is no normal, there's a type. There is a typical.
And would you want to meet those very gray people if there be?
I don't think about it.
If we changed this paradigm from one on how to get the normality to one on the possibility, or potential, we can understand the so many children, we can understand the so many kids, and inviting them to joining their preptious capacities with community.
The anthropologists teach us that what we we, as humans, we always wanted for the members of our community is to be helpful.
There is an evidence that in the Oland, 60 years ago, they brought the old and the subjects with gravity; perhaps thank you from the experience and survival of these people was the value of the community of the community of the community; they were seen this people like round and value.
A few years ago, I was in a citizens where I grew up in the north of Pennsylvania.
and I was stuck in front of a pound.
I was extended and I had pants.
I heard this guy, his voice behind myself, it's not Aimee Mullins" and Mullins." And I would." And I didn't have a half.
And I said, "Loom gentlemen, I don't remember have? I don't remember, I met him." He said, "You don't remember having me.
I mean, when we met when we met you were borrow out of your mother."
Risate Oh, that guy.
And, of course, in fact, I was playing a camping.
That ladies was the Dr. Kean, a man that I had only known by the stories of my mother on that day, because, clear typically, I got into two weeks.
And so, the knee quecologist of my mother had gone in vacance, so the man who gave me was a birthday for my parents.
And because I was born without the lost and I had the board, some fingers in this feet, and some in that time, he had to be the messaggere, that he had to deliver the bad news.
I said, "I've got to give this prognote to your parents that you wouldn't walk and you wouldn't walk and that you wouldn't have the kind of mobility that they have other children, or no lives, and I gave me the good around," and you gave me the extraordinary thing that I had the extraordinary articles at all my childhood, an extraordinary ary,
that I had rowed with the Girl Scout, you know, Hallowe'd won my studio, which I won my study, or all my sporate lives, and he used them, and he used them to use, and he used them and Hahenmic medicine schools of Haheneman of Hahneman and Hersheyann and Hershey.
And he called this part of the 1st, the potentiality of human.
No prognosis can hold in account of how pose it can be and determining the quality of life in a person.
And the doctor Kean continued to explain, and he said, "In my own experience, unless you repeated, and even though it is gives us a bunch of support, if you just leave to itself, one child.
You see, Dr. Kean changed his opinion.
I understood there's a difference between medical condition, and what each one can do with it.
And there's been a change in my think during the years, in this if you were asked me when I was about 15 years, if I had exchanged prostheses with the legs and I wouldn't exitate a second.
I was all that kind of normality at that time.
If you ask it today, I'm not safe.
And it's because of the experiences I had with them, not for the experiences that I had with them.
And the change in myself, because I was exposed to the people who opened me the door of the people who opened me.
You see, everything that you need is a person that you need is a person that shows you the epiphania, and you're started. If you can give somebody somebody your kles of their forces, the human spirit is so wealthy, if you can do it, and open a door for someone in a crucial moment, the education of the fundamental ways.
You're teaching them to open the doors.
In fact, the exact meaning of the word educate is from the roots "to exten" that means, to pull the potential.
So again, what is the potential that we want to pull out?
There was a study in the '60s in Grand short in the middle of the media.
It's called "prove in continuity," we call it "ling" here in the United States.
It means to separate students dependently by their you.
And the students with the best voters have a longer program -- and teachers a better teacher, they did it for a three months, and the students with insuffering, "opot" with optical vote vote -- they said they were good; they were smart.
And at the end of this period of three months, they were having the results of the optical level. And clearly, clearly, the sad of this studio, and who took students to say, "Finsufficienticienticient." And this is what happened at the end of three months.
The ones that were remained to school, beyond the ones I had leaved.
The crucial part of this study was that the teachers.
The teachers didn't know that it was done this change.
And it was said simple. These are the very good students.
And that's how they started to teach them.
So, I think the real disability is to have a damaged spirit and a damaged spirit doesn't have hope.
You don't see the beauty.
It has no natural, infantile curiosity and our innate capacity.
if you know, we can support the human spirit to maintain hope, to see the beauty of beauty in themselves and others, to be imaginatives that we're using our correctly.
When the spirit has these quality, we can create new realities and new ways.
