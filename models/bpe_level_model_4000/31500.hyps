Last year I showed these slides to show that the slide glacial calots, which for nearly three million years has had the size of 48 United States of the continental continental continental continental from 40 percent.
But this underpackages the problem because it doesn't show the ice of the problem because it doesn't show the ice.
The artic glacial calculation is, in a sense, the cleaner of the climate system.
You get the summers and reverse and return it out.
The next slide is going to be a quick carlled on the last 25 years.
The lost of them are signed in red red red red.
As you see, they expand they expand it up to the blue blue blue.
That's the ice in the winter, which is reverse of the summer.
You can see that the cosident who lost ice -- five years or more, is like the blood, which is the blood coming out of the body.
In 25 years old, it was like this, at the case.
This is a problem because the heat right-up terrain around the ocean around the ocean and where there are huge carbon of coal coal that you have coal with the microbes.
It respect to the total pollution from global warming, that amount of global warming, that amount of double, overcome come come back.
In some deep in some deep deep in Alaska is already rebolling from the water.
The professorse Katey Walter of the University of Alaska was rected with a team blake.
Video: Wow! Al Gore: You're good. The question is if we are going to be there.
A reason is that this termic exchange the Gerererand-scale Genlland,
This is a glacial record river.
The brought has never reached levels.
This is the Kangerlussuaq, in the southwest of Groenllland,
If you want to know how the sea level of the sea ice of ice ice ice on the ground of the ground of the ground of the sea.
These currents are increasing rapidly.
Another part of the planet.
The next month last month of the scientists have declassed that the ice is in negative, and that the Western Antarctical block on some of the submarine island, is particularly quickly in the monkey leaves.
Equival to six feet of water -- like the water level, like the Groenllland, as a Groenlland,
Sull'Himalaya, the third largest block of ice -- you see new laghi, and a few years ago they were ice to be ice
40 percent of the population remote half water water water water water from the monkey water from the monkey to the monkey water from the monkey water from the monkey to the monkey water from the monkey blow.
South Andelle is the source of the water water source of this city.
The brought is increased.
But when you decrease it happened to the water water potable.
In California neve on Sierra Nevada is 40-percent.
The hydrodrogen are in crisis.
The predictions as you have ready, they're grave.
The growing growing in the world leads to a nice of the firex increases of the fires.
The environmental disasters are increasing a rhythm and previous return.
Four times more numbers in the last 30 years of respect to previous 75.
This is a whole bunch of all sustainable of all sorts of unsustainable.
If you look in the history of the history of the history of it can see the consequences.
In the last five years we added 70 million tongue of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tongue in the oceans every day.
You look at the rise of the East East East East from the East Americe, in the ocean parts of the subject, where there is an impoor of the ocean oxygen.
The greatest cause of global warming, together to deforestation, which is 20, it's the use of fuel fuel fuels.
The oil is a problem, and the coal is even worse.
The United States are one of the two countries with more emissions, together at China.
And he proposed to build a lot of other central central central of all.
But we're looking at a direction.
These are the projects that are the last few years and some evidence of the green alternative verh of the green.
Anyway, there's a political lotta in our country.
The coal industry and oil has spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promoting carbon clean carbon clean and oxymore.
That image me reminded something --
Verunteer's in Tennessee, where I live, there's been a loss of 3.8 billion liters of carbon dive scale.
Maybe you have seen it on the news there.
This is the second largest flow of scories in America.
It happened around Natal.
The natalization of one of the carbon industry was this thing.
Video: It's like coal and Frosty is a type and happy.
It's abundant here in America, and it makes our economy.
Frosty the carbon is increasingly more and cleaner.
It's a good price, adorable and the workers are going to be thinking.
Al Gore: From here is a lot of coal West Virginia.
The largest society in the mountains is Masse's Masse's greatest society.
Video: Don Blland, Blland, Nancy Gore, Nancy Peloyalalalthough Harry Reid -- they don't know what they're talking about.
Al Gore: So the Alleance for the Clima Proteation of Clima has two campaigns.
This is a part of it, a part of it.
Video: At: At COALergives see the climate changes like a sery sery seria as a sery sertable.
So the first one of our priority is to invest a large amount of money in a effort, to make public and confused to make it and confused the coal truth to make it coal and coal truth.
In fact, carbon is not spore.
We think it's clean -- it also has a good profume.
So not preocupedic of climate change.
Let me do us.
Video: At: Colan pulit -- you heard a lot of it.
So we do a around a structure of the framework for how much about coal coal coal coal coal coal.
Straordinary cars are a little romore, but this is the sound of the technology of the clean technology of the clean technology.
The coal consuming is between the main causes of global warming, but the remarkable technology of coal that you see changes everything.
You take a look at the clean occacacade fuel technology.
Al Gore: Infinally, the good alternative to economic the economic and the national safety and the national safety of national safety safety.
Video: Comment: America, is the national security economics, the climate.
The file that lines all the is: our dependence from fuel fuels and oil-sports and oil.
Now, yet, there's a new solution for ushes to use.
Rear America: 100 percent of clean energy in 10 years.
A plan to reput America to work, make us sure to do it safe the global warming.
Finally, a solution that you get to solve our problems.
Fince America. Scover of the more.
Al Gore: This is the last one.
Video: Comment: It's about reeating America.
One of the fastest ways of end end end end up to the fuel of combusters that kills our planet.
Comparsa: The future is here.
You know 2: 2: Nuovi investment for very well retribites.
Comment: Rear America. It's time to be realists.
Al Gore: A old proverbial African says, "If you want to go speed to yourself.
If you want to go far away, you go together."
We have to go far fast.
Thank you very much.
Last year at TED I did a TED I did a LHC.
And I promises of returning to how the machine.
So here I am here I go. And for those that the other time doesn't have been there, the LHC is the biggest scientific experiment.
Her job is to rere-the conditions that were present less than a billion-year-second way of the universe -- until 600 million times a second.
All of this is just the environment.
This is the car below Ginevation.
We From these min-Big Bang in the relevel of the relevel in the relevel of the relevel Bang in the relevel.
This is what I work. It's called AS -- it's called AS -- it's 44 feet and it has a 2,000-foot and has a 2meters of 2meters
This is a spectacular image of ATLAS in building so you can see the proportion of the proportion of the proportion of of ATLAS in building so you can see the proportion of the ATLAS in building so you can see the proportion of the ATLAS in building so
The 10 secember of the last year we accession the car for the first time.
And this picture was taken by ATLAS.
It was because of a muntips in the control.
It's a first picture of the first particle of particles that had done all the LHC, by the LHC, and by a part of the LHC, and spread particles in the remarkable particles inside the resource.
In other words, when we saw that image the 10 secember, we knew that the car workwere, the machine that is a great live.
I don't know if it was this to do more than that, when someone went on Google and saw that the page was this to Google and it was this one.
That means that we had a cultural impact beyond scientific impact beyond scientific impact beyond scientific impact beyond scientific impact beyond scientific impact beyond the scientific impact beyond the scientific impact beyond scientific impact beyond in the scientific impact of the scientific impact beyond scientific impact beyond in the scientific impact of the scientific impact of the scientific impact of the scientific impact of the scientific impact of the scientific impact of the scientific impact of the scientific impact of the beyononononononononononononones.
About a week later, there was a problem with the car, had to these films here -- these sleeps here -- these sleeps here -- these sleep.
These films take 13,000 amps of the power of power.
Now, the technicians between you will look at the files, "It's not true. It's not true. It's not true. It's too underly."
And instead of it can do it because when they're very fresh as they become the superconductors.
So, at least 271 degrees, at least 271 degrees that of the space between the stars, these films can bring that current.
In one of the junctures in the LHC, there was a fabrication.
So the strands of warming ready, and 13,000 amps suddenly met a electricity.
This was the result.
Now, this is even more impression if you think these magnety fish more than 20 tons, and that have been moved about 30 centimeters.
They were damaged about 50 magnets.
We had to take them to take them to do that we did it.
We repristine them and updy.
Now they're now coming back to their place on the ground place.
I Entro the end of the mark the LHC is will be new inteer's going to be new intea.
And we would like it and expect us to get the right data or him, and we continue that our adventure to find out what the morning is the morning of the universe.
Now, of course, in a certain way these accidents reaccending the debate of science and engineering front of science and engineering front of the science and engineering front of it.
I think that the fact that it's so difficult, the fact that you can go beyond the things like LHC.
I would like to end with the words of a scientist Inglese, Humphrey Davy, the guy, the guy, the pupill, the pupill, his pupill, his pupill, his pupill, his pupill, he said, "No is as dangerous for progress of humans as much as the science is definitely dought as the degree of the human science is definitely that we haven't have new money, and that are not not new money, and that we are not not not not not new monekeys are new money.
Thank you.
I want to start asking you to think about how to be children, playing the morning.
As you can get them as you get to reach them and grab them, you learn to get them and get them to think and solve problems and resolving problems and manipulating relationships.
The space reasoning is deeply connected to the way we understand the world around us.
So, from informath inspired by our physical objects, with my physical objects, together with my own Patti, and my collaborator, and my collaborator, and my collaborator, I started asking "And if we use a computer, instead of having the only as a computer, instead of having the only degree treatment of the way to a digital detect of the sends of a digital information with ently an information with entititition,
and we can it it with our pleasure pleasure of it?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer, building the answer, building Siftable.
In a few words, a Siftable is a big interactive computer.
In a few words, a Siftable is a big interactive computer.
You can move them with the hand, they can see them in them, feel the right and they have a screen and a wireless radio and a wireless radio and a wireless radio wireless and a wireless radio wireless radio wireless and they have a wireless and a wireless radio of them.
But above it, they're physicists, as physics, as the morning, you can just move it to the simply business.
The Sifty is the example of a new ecosystem for a new ecosystem for a digital information
And as they become more physicists, you know, you know how we are the motion, and as they become more physicist, and as they become more physicist, and others, how we move them to the others of how we move them and different style style still.
I'm going to start with some simple example.
This Sifty is configured to show video: if you include it in a direction, the video will rootery like this, if they including the other hand, in the other part of the back.
These interactive rings are conscious conscious of others.
If they graduate them to be interested in what they would be around them.
If they come circumstances, they can see it and they can get a little bit.
If they come circumstances, they can see it and they can get a little bit.
They also have their movement.
We then realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was the common to data, to example a liquid as if it was a liquid.
In this case, we have three Siftable configured as a green dry and I can use them to sent the color in the central that where they mix them.
and I can use them to be able to be able to sent it to the central color, where they milk.
If we are too too much of it.
There are also good possibilities of learning, like languages, like languages, the mathematics and games of the logic and see the results of the immediately.
Now I'm --
This is a Redwood sequence of Fibonacus that I do with a program of equations.
Here we have a game of words between Scarabeo and Boggle.
And in fact, at every turning, you get a letter case on every Siftable, Prrically, at every turnner, and as you get a letter to every Siftable, and as you try to make a dictionary.
And then about 30 seconds remisses and you have a new set of readers and new possibility.
Thank you.
And here is what kids came to the Media Lab, I did them in a way that they tried them and I turned a video.
They have a lot of pleasure of them.
And one of the interesting things of this is that you don't have to give you a lot of education is that you don't have to get a lot of educational things that you have to have a lot of educations.
You just have to say, "Compione," and they know exactly what to do.
That's what other people who try it.
This is our youngest beta younger head.
It really wanted to get a milk.
They were just morning, for him, for him.
Now, this is a application of a interactive cartoon --
We wanted to build a tool, to be the learning, Lui is Felix.
It can be new characters in the scene, satis; they can sleeping the Siftable to get new characters.
It can be new characters in the scene, satis; they can sleeping the Siftable to get new characters.
And that's where you get the sun of the sun
Video: The sun is surgency.
David Merrill: Now it has taken a treatment.
Video: The arancient treatment.
Bel work! Yes!
So if you school, Siftable and put it close to interact the characters --
Video: Bau!
-- by inventing their story.
Video: Hell: Hell!
DM: It's a story with the open end of the opening, and it can decide him as you want.
DM: It's a story with the open end of the opening, and it can decide him as you want.
Video: Golden gates.
DM: The last example I have time to show you is a tool, made recently recently recently and exeguing music.
is a tool, made recently, to sample and executing music.
Sifty here are act as sounds and the back, lower, low-down and bacteria
Every one of these has four different variations, and you can choose what to use.
You can put these sound sound in a sequence that you can get these sound sequence to your pleasure to your pleasure to your pleasure to get your pleasure to get your pleasure.
And then you can just just touch a sound and a "Redan."
These are actually that you can control from the living and the filter and the filter and the filter and the filter of it.
You attackets to a particular sound and then including it in the sets of it.
And then there are the general as long and flies, which you apply to the sequence.
Let's look at how it works.
Video: DM: We will start putting a two Siftable "Redan," we can put it in a seriously, we get the extend other basis.
Now I put a bunch line.
Video: DM: Now I add some of the percent of the ...
Video: DM: And now I'll put the bacteria, so I can control the same.
Video: DM: I can speak the entire sequence sequence by a launch or the other.
Video: DM: And now I'll add the bottom to get more expression.
Video: DM: I can recombined the sequence "volote."
So I don't have to plan earlier, but I can sudden, make it longer or more corn.
And now, finally, I can sfum the entire sequence sequence linking on the left the Siftable "volume."
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is building new interfaces of man-machine always works like how our brains work and the body.
And today, I had time to show you one of this lost results, and also some possibilities that we try to bring out the lab out of the lab that we try to bring out the lab out of the lab of the lab that we are looking out of the lab of this lost and also some possibilities that we are the results of this coral, and also some opportunities that we are the results of this cord, and also some possibility that we are the results
The concept I want to transmitate is that it's coming this new generation of objects that are designed to interact with digital media in the way we want.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the time to talk to all of you.
I'm a writer.
And you get books is my profession, but it's more than that, of course, of the time.
It's also love and the love, the folks of my life.
And I don't expect that can change.
But that, something particularly happened in my life and my career, and my career, who took me to realibrate the whole relationship with this job.
The particular thing is I was recently written this book, this biography called "Mangia, Prega, and the quality, and differently from my previous books, for some reasons that the world and became a great conditional, sense, feelings, a conditional sense, ny interaction.
And the result is that everywhere you go to me as if you were convicted as if you are convice.
It really -- convicted -- condnurately.
They all come from me to me now all worried and they say, "You don't have fear not afford to do better.
You don't have fear to continue to write the whole life without being able to create a book that can important book that can important to somebody?"
that can importate somebody?"
It's rassecurity, you know.
But it could go worse -- part of that I remember that over 20 years ago, when I started to say people -- I was a adolescent -- I wanted to be a writer.
I would go to the same reaction based on the fear.
And people would say, "Don't you have succeed?
You don't have fear that the humiliation of refute to kill it?
You don't have fear to do this mestior to die without that anything comes out and die on a heart of a samp of samp with the mouth of loving out of bucks with failing bank bank bank bank you to make a fail?"
So, you know, you know.
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is "Yes."
And I fear of all those things.
I always had fear.
And I also have a lot of other things that people can't have to be in it.
As the allow and other things that are shavently.
But as it was writing the writing what I thought and ask me the momently is why?
Is it rational?
It's logic that anyone who should be spent by a job that you feel born to do.
But what is there so particular one in the impreventable creative to make us nervous health to make it nervous health in a way that other people don't do that?
As my father, for example, he was a chemical engineer and I don't remember one time in his 40 years of activity in which he was asked if he was afraid engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to it?
It was never -- that block of engineer engineer as it does?
It didn't work.
Onestly, the chemicals like group didn't have certainly uncertainly, in the seats, and the reputation of being alcoholed manages.
We writers, we have enough this reputation and not only writers but creative of all of all these reputation reputation of being about.
And it's not going to be another death contact of magnifies of the magnifies of the magnificent of the magnificent of the magnificent of the magnification that only in the 2th century,
And even those who don't have seem to be really disappeared to be disappeared.
Norman Mailer, before you die, in the last interview said, "Of me me a little bit of a little bit of a great deal in the work of their own life.
But we don't date it to the food, when we heard these things that so long, we heard these things that we have completely interiorized and accepted the notion and suffering are somehow to and the art, to the end of the art, and the art, will always be in a few days, to the enjoy of the range of it.
And the question I want to bring to all of today, you agree with this idea?
It's good for you -- because it also looks at a centimeter of the distance to me doesn't really do that for anything about this suppose.
I think it's odious.
And I think it's also dangerous, and I don't want to see the perpetual century.
I think it's better to encourage our great minds of living living living living living in lives.
And certainly I know that in my case -- in my situation -- would be very dangerouse to start to that they were in my own own own heart of supposing the circumstances in my career.
Of course, -- I think about 40 years old, I have about 40 years.
I still have about four decades of work in me.
And it's very likely to write about now then then it will be judged by the world as the work that came after the world as a late successful book.
I'll be slavery, because we're all more or less friends here -- is likely to my greatest successful is my greatest successful to my shoulder.
Oh, Gesus down, who think!
You know this is the kind of thinking that leads a person to start brought to the nine morning, and I don't want to do it.
I would prefer to continue to do this work that we do.
So, the question becomes like, right?
And so I think, after many reflection -- that the way to work to continue to write is to create a psychological cooking a perty performance.
I have a few way to find a safety distance between me, which I'm writing the natural game on what reaction is the written year to get some of the best year models on how to do it by looking through time, trying to find other societies to see if they could have the best and more health and healthy healthy and healthy healthy healthy and healthy blood more blood than they had the best blood and more health and more blood and more blood and more
how to help people create creative risks of creative inerents risks of creative life risks of creative life.
And that research led me to the ancient Great and ancient Ruse.
See it because it is the circle and then back back back.
In ancient Great and ancient Rome -- people didn't seem to believe that creativity -- people didn't seek to man, OK?
It was thinking that creativity was this spirit and who came up and who came to humans from a few distant aths, and unknown and unknown and unknown and unknown away.
The Greeks were called these spirits and the Gdian creativity did."
Socry, wonderful crew to have a demone that eline shocrats from far away.
The Romans were the same idea, but they called that spirit of spirit without a genius.
which is great, because Romans didn't think that a genius was really that a genius was a particular smart of genius.
They believed that a genius was this sort of divine entity that created lived in the military of the study of the artist, a little like the Dobby, and who came out to hidden the work of the artical articum and model the result of that work.
Ecceptal -- well, that's the distance of the park that -- that construct psychological that has to protect you from the results of your work.
And everybody knew that it was so that it worked, right?
So the ancient artists were protof of circles that you know, like the too narciss;
If your work was exception you couldn't take all the detap all the degree that was helped by this genius.
If your work fail, it wasn't all that you have, right?
Everybody knew it was your genius to be a incapable of it.
And so people han conceived the creativity in the Ocdent for a long time.
And then the Redge came and all changed this, and changed this big idea, we put the human beings to the center of the universe over all the mist of the universe and mysteries and without having a space creatures that write detail.
This was the principle of humans rational and people began to think that creativity came completely from the hydrodrops.
And for the first time in history, it started to reference this or that article like a genius than a person with genius.
And I have to tell you, I think it was a big mistake.
I think that allowed someone to believe somebody, a simple person to believe being like a recipe as a recient as a recipe and the surprising mysteries, creatives, unknowable and ethium is a responsibility to fragile ft, and the human smart is a responsibility to frace.
It's like to ask someone to ingowear the sun.
It deform distores all these ingestious ingestiable ingestiable for performance.
And I think it was this pressure to have destroyed the artists in the past 500 years.
And if this is true, and I think it is, the question becomes up, and it becomes it?
Can we can do it different?
Maybe you can go back to a more ancient understanding of the relationship between humans and mystery creative of human relationships.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we can't get 500 years of thinking of rational thinking in a 18 minutes.
And there is people in the audience that would sweep, you know, you have a scientific susptical of the notion of the notion of the unfairs of their projects.
I probably won't convince you all about this thing.
But the question I want to ask is -- why no?
Why don't you think that in this way?
Because it has more sense of everything that has ever heard to explore the exasperants of creative processes of creative process.
Another as anyone who has been trying to do something -- so, basically all here -- yeah, basically all here -- you know, it's not rationally.
And in fact, it can sometimes seems to be completely paranormal --
I did this recent recently with the extraordinary poet Ruth Stone who has now 90 years, but that was a poet-year-old old old in the Virginia, and he was working out in the Virginia, and he was working out in the field, and he felt it in it, when a poem in the country.
She said it was like a tragorthotic folding of the air.
And he got rolling up to her landscape.
It was going to get there, because he had to get the earth below its feet.
He knew it was having one thing to do to do that point and he was like, "run a morne."
And so it was going to be in the house and it was going to be able to do a piece of paper and wouldn't have to take a piece of paper and a mate, as the transportation and a fresh fitself.
Sometimes it didn't be quite fast and it was so fast and running and the correct and the roll her rotoln and the lost and the lost and he was performed and he would continue to roll through the landscape, as he said, "another poet it."
And then there were times -- this piece I will never forget -- there were timing moments in which the was almost lost moments in which he was it?
So, he was running at the house and he was trying to card and the poem was going to go through and he was going to go through and then he was as he was going on, and then he was as if you flowing up with the other hand the off.
He was going to go to the poem from the tail and released it in his body and turned it on the page.
And in these cases, the poem would be presented on the perfect page and intacts to the first word to the first word to the first word to the first word to the first word to the first word to the first word to the first one.
So when I felt you know -- it's crazy -- it's just crazy to my creative process.
Not my creative process -- I'm not a conduct!
I'm a mulum, and my way to work is it to be able to do it on the same orary every day and sum and work on the way over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over the time.
But even I stand in my headlines against that thing, and I shopped against that thing, at the time,
And I imagine that many of you have.
You know, even though the work and ideas came from a certain source of them would not be able to honestly know. I could not honestly know.
And what is this thing?
And how can we relate to it in a way that we don't do lose your head, pluttost, what do you do about it?
I have is the best example of me, the best contemporary example that I have is the musician musician and I interviewed different years ago for a day.
We were talking about this, and you know, Tom, for the majority of life has been the incarnation of the artist in the tower, trying to control these creative pulside, manages, and dominate these totally interiorate species.
But then he got hotbed up, and one day when he was driving on a cartototo-Los Angeles, changed all for him.
She was going to go speed and all of a little bit of this little framtion of this melodia, which comes into its head, which comes to his head as it makes the inspiration, elusive, and the want, you know, it's wonderful, and the desire, but not as you get it.
It doesn't have a piece of paper has no mate, it doesn't have a recorder.
So he starts to hear this sort of old anxiety growing in him and say, "I'm going to lose and remarrush from this lost zones.
I'm not pretty good and I can't do it."
And instead of going to stopped it.
And he did the whole process and did something completely new.
He just looked at the sky and said, "cuse, don't see that I'm driving?"
"Do you think it can write a song now?
If you really want to exist, it goes back in a more opport, when I can take care of you.
Othereforment, you go to to anything.
You go to disturbing Leonard Cohen."
And his process worked changed after that.
Not the work, the work even even as dark as sound.
But the process of the weight and the fish range that was released when the genius, the genius, the genius, the genius that out of him who was caused to be a very interior that was that he had no one thing that had to be an interior and tormented.
But he beyond this peculiar and beautiful cool, a conversation between Tom and this stuff that was not Tom.
So how much how the story started to change a little bit how I was working and already saved me a time.
This idea, I was saved me when I was writing "Mangia, Prega, and falls in one of those disperation in which we all when we are working on something and we all when we are working on something and you can't start thinking that will be the worst book that will be the worst book that will be the worst book that will be the worst book --
Not just bad book, just the worst book writing.
And I started thinking about throwing this project.
But then I reminded from the air and try it.
So I went to my face on the hands of dark and I would say my comments to a room.
And I said, "You know, you know, you know, you know, you both know that if this book will not be brilliant, you know, it's not going to be like mind, you know?
Because as you see that I'm putting all that I haven't haven't got that.
So if you want to be better and you have to introduce your parts.
Okay, but if you don't do it, you know what, you know, I don't do it anything.
I'm going to write the same because it's my work.
And I would like to favor that was that I had today to do my own own own particip," because it -- at the end of the North Africa in the North Africa people were dances of the North Africa to the dance of the dance of the dance, dance and music, and the music dance that were going to be on for hours and the heba.
And they were always magnificent because the dances were professionals, and they were fantastic.
But every time, it was rary, and one of these artists became actually translent --
And I know what I talk about what I talk, because I know you have seen everybody, at some point, a performance of it.
It was like the time stops, and the dance, and he was walked through a kind of dooral and was not doing anything differently, like 1,000 nights earlier.
And suddenly it doesn't just like a human being.
But it turns out to the divince and detailed in the fire of the divinity.
And when this next time, this next to the time, people knew what he was, they were called him with his name.
They had the hands and start to singing, "Allah, Allah, Allah, God God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God."
That's God, you know.
Curious known -- when the More invaser's south of Spain the Spain and the website of their and the ready one changed in the centuries of "Allah, Allah, Allah," "Oh, ooh," you can hear in the corrids or in the flamenic.
In Spain, when a artist has made something impossible and magic -- "At the magnifi, you know, you can -- a last deah, you know, it's a last last one.
And it's great because we need.
But the problem comes the next day after the ballery itself, when you wake up and finds the 11 in the morning of Martedday, and the last of God is not more.
It's just a mortal with great mal with great mal to the knee, and maybe never will never have to get to that height.
And maybe nobody will be the name of God still as it still becomes on his life?
It's hard.
This is one of the most painful reconciliations to make a creative life.
But maybe it doesn't have to be so angoeless if you can not believe that, you know, the most extraordinary aspects of your being come from you to yourself.
But it just crew you get data in the preme from a fount of this team of this team of your life that has to go to somewhere else when you have finished.
And you know, if we think of this is all change.
And so I started thinking about it, and it's certainly as I thought for different months in the work of the book that I will do prestate, the dangerous spectaculous pathesis that I was going to be able to be on my big, success.
And what I have to keep telling me when I feel electric me that is, not having fear.
Let me just just your job. It just just your job.
It keeps the end of your partner, any can be.
If your work is dance.
If the divine, assurd, assigned genius decided to leave some of the wonderful kind of of gaps some of wonderful for a moment through your efs, then "Oh, no!"
Otherement, you do the same as your dance.
And "Oh, it goes!" to yourself.
I think I think it's got to teach it.
"Yes!" to yourself, even for human and headlines and tests talks to give you a little bit of your own own talks to give you a continuously.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
As you know I've been talking about some of these projects on human genome on what can mean, and what can meaning and the new genes.
We're now starting a new percorsoon -- we started digitalize biology and now starting from that digital code we're coming into a new phase, and by sharing life.
We always tried to ask the big questions.
"What is the life?" is something that many biologists have tried to understand in levels.
We tried a different approaches, reducing it to minimes to the minimes of terms of it.
We're digitalizing from nearly 20 years ormas.
When we sequenced the human genome was treated to go from the world from the analogic world to the digital world of the computer.
Now we ask ourselves to the life, or create new life from this digital universe from this digital universe?
This is the map of a small organism -- Mycoplasma genitalium, which is the species from genitalium, which is the species of the best of the ones that can authorities.
And we tried to reduce the genome to create one even smaller even smaller.
We can eliminate a hundred genes of the genes of the about 500 that are here.
But when we look at the metabolic map of the map of the noad-round respect at the noroad.
You know, it's simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate each of the genes that can bring a living cell vivent.
So we decided that the only way to progression was to synthetize this chromosome in a way to make the components to bring some of these fundamental questions.
And so we started the adventure of the "Can we can synthetic a chromoso?"
Can the chemistry to produce these great molecules that we haven't ever managed to create before you?
And in case that we can make a chromosoun?
A chromosome is just a piece of chemical material in the unert material
The speed that we are able to digitalize life is growing up to exponential report.
Our capacity to write the genetic code, again code, progression of mind, but it's getting improving.
And our most recently, the results are the exponential curve.
We started over 15 years ago.
The process has required a lot of passes and starting with a bioetic review before we started the first experiments.
But we found that DNA is very difficult.
There are tens of thousands of cars in the world that produce small segments, the long of 30 to 50 letters and is a degenerative process -- the most chance is longer segment is longer, the segment is longer than the segment is longer than we are.
So we had to develop a new way to assembling these framds and the mistakes and the mistakes the mistakes.
And this was our first attempt to start to start to the digital information of Phi X-174.
It's a small virus that kills bacteria.
We designed the fragments, effectivated the restration of mistakes and you get a molecule.
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemical material and we put it into the bacteria and put it into bacteria started reading this genetic and detect the particles and product particles the virals.
The virals have been released by cell phones, they come back and they flew the E.
I talked about recent members of the petrolifestyle industry.
They reveals more than you.
We believe that this is a situation where software can really build his hardware really building its own hardware in a biological system.
But we wanted to do things bigger in large things.
We wanted to build the entire chromosome.
It's over 580 thousand miles of genetic code --
So we thought of building it in the bottom-size of viruses so that we can change the bucks to understand what the components of a living cell cell.
The design is crucial and if we start with digital information in a computer, these must be very accurated.
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995, the standard accuration was a mistakes for every 10 mile mile for every 10 miles --
We have discovery resequencing, 30 mistakes. If we had that original sequence we would never be able to do it work.
A part of the process is designing down to the 50 letters that are overwhelming with all the other segments of 50 letters to build underunits smaller to work together.
We try to make one one of the unites here.
You probably have the lap that we put the fold.
Think of it is: We have a genetic code based on four letters: A, G.
Three of those letters together and they codify about 20 administry -- and there's a specific order of reading for every friend.
So we can use genetic code for writing words, you think, though.
What we did we have been authography.
Some of them have been dolphins from the fact that it wasn't poem.
We designed these segments to just bring them to a fundamental with the fundamental of them.
There are enzyme that repair them and put them with them.
And we started assembling of parts, starting with five miles letter to seven miletter to seven miles in a way that we can sit at 24 mile letter to their time to get to 72 milletter to their letter to 72 miletter letter to be able to 72 miletter letter to segments.
Anyway, we have these sat these sandwings that we are trying to make a very robute that we're trying to create a very robony proceeding -- as you will see in a minute.
We're trying to automatize the process.
So, this seems the site of a basketchet.
When we get these segments are much longer than 100 mile mile would not grow up to the E.
You get to the limestimate modern biology of molecular biology
So we looked at other mechanism.
We knew another mechanism called homology, which is a homology of homology recombination that in biology is useful to repair the DNA to unique the segments.
Here's an example.
This organism called Deinococcus radio harans, it can absorb three million rads of radiation.
You can see in the background of the ground like his chromosome.
In 12 -- 24 hours comes reassembled exactly as it was before.
There are thousands of organisms that have able to do that.
These organisms can be able to be able to be able to be complex.
They can live under a vacuum.
I'm absolutely absolutely absolutely sure life existing in space, and you get new water environments of water.
And in fact, the NASA showed that this happens.
This is a picture of the molecules that we built using these processes -- just using the lights with the design of the inserious chances.
The lights them carefully.
This image wasn't taken with a photo have a regular microscope with a regular microscope with a regular microscope with a regular microscope with a regular electron microscope --
It's a very big molecule. And that's a great slightly that we can see it with a slightly slightly leaving microscope --
These are pictures that cover a period of six seconds.
This is the published that we did a little time ago.
It's over 580,000 letters of genetic code --
It's the largest molecules that ever created by man.
It has a 300 million million of the sush of 300 million of the million.
If we spent it with a 10 paper without spaces, it would take 142 pages to just get this genetic code to get this genetic code to get this genetic code.
Now, how do we work work? How can we active?
Of course, you get a virus is a game by kids.
It's a little bit more complicated when you use bacteria --
It's also simpler when it's cells as a ourselves as a ourselves as our ours -- you can just get the nucleus and insert one way, which is basically the cloneline, which is basically the clone.
In the bacterium is the skin the cell is integrated in the cell but we just just showed that we can do a complete train a chromosome, and we had a cell to another and active and to activity the other and active.
We purified a sromosome, from a microbial species.
The two are different as men from the touches from the touches.
We added some genes in the way that we can decide what to do for this chromosoon.
It then brought it with enzyme as a way to kill all proteins.
And when we put it in the cell was stupending on -- and you will open our graphic soft -- the new chromosome has gone into the cell phone.
And we were we could not go to that three, but we tried it still has tried to get us over there.
This is one of the greatest mechanisms of evolution.
We found that a second species have added a second or a third of some parts, added a second and add in a second thousands of new trates, and add in a second thousands of new trates.
So who think about evolution as a only gene to evolution that has not understood the biologists of biology.
There are enzyme called restripes of restription is that even digesting DNA.
The chromosome that was in the cell of it has no one.
The cell phone-the chromosomes that we put it on the ha.
And it turns out that and recognized the other way as a extranem material, and we found it with just the cell and the new cell with just the cell and the new chromo.
It became blue because of the genes that we have inserved.
And in a short lasses of time, all the characteristics of a species have gone per, and it turned out of the new software that we put in the cell phone of the new software that we put in the cell phone of the mobile phone of the species have been a cell of the species have been a new software that we put in a new software that we put in the mobile phone.
All the proteins are changed, membranes have changed, and when we read the genetic code the equivalent code exactly what we have transferred you.
Now, this may seem alchemics, but we can change the DNA DNA can change things in a pretty substantial enough things that are in a pretty remarkable way.
Now, I've already explained that this is not about genesesis -- but progress from three million and a half million evolution, and I already said that maybe we're going to create a new version of the Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosion process.
Why do you do that?
I think it's quite obvious when we think of our needs.
We're going to go from six and a half billion people in the next 40 years.
Just to give an example: I am born in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for each existing in 1946; 40 years, there will be four of them will be four of them will be four of them are going to be four of them in 1946; it will be four of them are going to be four of them are going to be four of each other.
We're having trouble now to find food, water and clean and clean medicination and gass for six and a half billion people.
It's going to be harder to do it for nine billions.
We use more than five billion coal of 10 billion barrels of oil --
That means a million barrels a day.
When we try to find biological processes or any kind of process to replace them, it will be a huge challenge challenge to replace them is a huge challenge of biology, or any kind of process to replace them is a huge challenge of the process to replace that is a huge challenge of the way to replace and replace it will be a huge challenge of the process of replacement,
We have to keep the whole of CO2 emission of these materials that ends up in the atmosphere.
At the day of today, because of scientific discovery in the world, we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I like to think that are the designers for the future.
The electric industry has only a dozen dozen about how many different things have come out of them.
Our limits here are principles of biological and our imagination.
Now we have technics, thank these quickly methods of sympts, can create what we call combinatory genomics.
We can build a big robots that can produce a million chromosomes a million a day.
Think of processing these 20 million genes or to try to get the different genes of property processes to produce either either vaccines, we can change, because of a small team, and create more molecular biology now that in the last 20 years of science.
And it's just a standard selection.
We can choose to survive production or carbon and carbon production of chemical vaccines.
This is a computer instantly some software programs that we're working on to be able to sit and design species to be able to sit and designing species to the computer.
Well, we don't know how they will be year.
We know exactly what their genetic code code --
Now we're focusing on the carbons of quarter generation.
You also see that you get them ethanol from the grate was an experiment.
We have coal coal and third generation will be going to be pretty soon as a sugar, higher as the optane as the either as the either as the either as a --
But the only way the biology can have a big impact without increasing impact on food and limiting the cost of food and limiting the delibility would be transforming the cell in material, where we're working for designing cells that can achieve this purpose, and we think we can have the first coal of about 18 months.
The sunlight combined with CO2 is a methodom -- but in our discoveries around the world, we found different methods.
This is a organism that we described in 1996.
It lives in the ocean extra deep ocean to the eboard temperature of the water.
It creates metane from CO2 using hydrogen molecular as a source of energy sources.
We're trying to understand whether we can get the CO2, which can easily be transported by tubes, converting that CO2 in order to drive this process of carbon to drive this process.
So short we think we might be able to increase what the basic question that the basic question of what is the life." We have the goal -- we have the goal of replacing the entire petrochemicals.
Exactly. If you can't do it from TED, where can you do it?
It would be a main source source of energy sources.
And in addition, we're working to use the same methods to create instantanes.
You see this year with influence, we're always going to go back to a year and a dollar dollar when it comes to find the right vaccine.
I think that you can change in a anticide combinable vaccines in anticipy.
And that's how the future might start changing, now the evolution, accelerating evolution, by snetry, archaaahs, archaahs, and finally hitting cells.
We're so much from the way to improve people.
Our purpose is to make enough long-to try to do a very much.
First of all, I'll give you the most quickly possible, some fundamental job of the new technology that we took to Microsoft in a water, almost a year ago aquace.
It's a local that you can interact with is a local level that remote with a huge amount of visual data.
Here we're seeing a lot of gigabyty photos with a kind of a very expensive zoom and continue, for a very very large sandwim and continue, and that images as we want.
And it doesn't matter how much the amount of information that we see is the amount of information that we see, how big these data are these data collects or images.
Most of them are type, but this is a scannotion from the Library from the Library from the Library of the Congress rewing the legal of the Congress --
It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that the prestations of a system like this is the number of pixels on your screen in any time. It's also a very flexible.
This is a whole book of data, you don't imagine.
This is the Dickens. Every colonna represents a chapter of a chape.
To show you that it's just about testing and not imagines, we can do something like that, to do something like this, to see that it is a real representation of the head, not a photos.
It may be a little artificial way to read a little artificial book.
You don't advice.
This is a more realistic example of the Guardian.
Every picture is the beginning of a selection.
And it really gives you the pleasure of law the experience of reading the real version of a magazine or a neartheist, which is for nature a multiple type.
We also did something with the corner of this particular number of the Car Guardian.
We created a high-resolution-resolution-resolutions, much more than what you use in a normal normal commercial content -- and we put you in the extraordinary content content ent content ent content ent content ent ent content ent content ent ent content ent ent ent content ent -- and we put you know, a higher of the higher that you use in a very high resolutions.
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile, you can see here.
Or other models, or even specific specific specific that we can do it.
And this really demonstrates some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on the screen.
And we hope that this lady to put the pop-up to the pop-up and other doorcheries, not to be necessary.
Of course, the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology.
And I don't want to lose time, if you don't say that we have contributed to the field.
These are all the streets in the U.S. overwhelmed on a geospatial image of the NASA.
So now we're going to go to something else.
This is now from the living living living on the webs; you can see it on the webs; you can see it.
It's a project called Photosynth, which fights two different technologies.
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual computer to do very interesting computer that in Noah Snavely, a student of Washington, with Steve Seitz UWashington, with Steve Seitz UWashington, with Microsoft Research. A very good collaboration.
And it's living on the web, and it was in the web,
You can see it when we do this kind of screens, where we can go from one image to the other and have this kind of experience to resolution in multiply.
But the space collection of images here has actually a meaning.
The visualization of computer visualization has recorded these images together, so that they correspond to the real places where the reaction -- all all the way the images -- all the way the Grassi on Montagne Roccic Farticulates -- you see the elements of a slide-show show -- you see the elements of a slide-stable of space.
I don't know if I have time to show you some other environment.
There are some more space than some of the space of them.
I want to spend one of the original data set of Noah-ext data -- and this is from a previous Photosynth that we did for the first time last sumed -- to show you what I think is really the chievement of this technology, Photosynth. And it's not necessarily as a technology, Photosynthosynthight that we have in the website --
We had to worry about the legal aspects and so forth.
This is a reconstruction of Notre Dame images previous Flickr. Bastdigital Flickr. Bastdigital Flickr and you get images of the camps, other of the campus, and you get images of these argue articulate represents a picture that has been discovered to this model.
So they're all required images that were all plug lined to this way.
And it's possible to navigate that very simple.
You know, I would never have thought I end up working for Microsoft.
It's very gratification receive that kind of drug here.
I think you can see that it's a lot of different types of framework from those of the SLR, a meaningful number of phones in this environment.
And if you can do that I try to try to try to find those more strange things.
Many are blocked by factory, etc.
Something is a series of photographs -- there it is.
This is a poster poster poster Fince First Fince Finus.
We can go from the physics of this environment.
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment. This now is taking data from everyone -- from collective interviewing as the Earth, from the view, from the ground point of view, and links all those data together.
All those photos become linked together, the greater than the sum of the parts.
You have a model of the earth of the earth of the earth of the earth of the earth of the earth of the earth of the earth of the entire emergence.
Think about this as a prolungment of the work of Stephen Lawler on Earth virtual virtual Earth virtual virtual Earth is virtual Earthly virtual Earth virtual virtual face.
It's something that grows in complexity as people use it, and the people that are use, and the uses that are use.
Their photos are marked with metadhited by other people.
If anybody is the idea of conventing all these dress say that my photo the narral of Notber Dame suddenly has arriches of all those dates, and I can use it as a point of all those data, and I can use it as a picture of anyone else, and having a social experience of them in the space, and have a social experience of type of the type of red-to-shot-shot-shot-to-shot-shot-shine redrural redrate and ck to get up with the whole of the whole of the bleasking of the idea of the idea of these of these of these
Of course, a consequence of all these are very highly elaborate models of every interesting part of the earth, and so that it doesn't only see and satellite images and similar satellite images and similar memory and similar memory of collective and satellite images.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I realized that what your software will have to do is that at a certain point, in the next few years, all the photographs of people who shared by anyone in the world or will be basically connect?
BAA: Yeah. What is doing is doing it is basically discovered.
He's creating hyperlink if you want, between images.
And it's doing it in the content of the images.
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the wealth information that many of these images are that are that are a lot of these images are that are going to be very interesting --
As you get a research of images on the web, you have a sentence and the textent on the Web is a lot of information about images of the pictures of the pictures of the pictures of the pictures of the picture.
Now, what happens if that picture you connects all your picture?
So the amount of semant interconnection and the amount of recipe and the amount of recipe is really enormous classical effect. It's a classic effect.
CA: Blaise, it's really amazing Compliments.
BAA: Thank you very much.
One of the main pleasure of the delight-inch of the inner research is the way that we can live in who has the traditions, between who has the past, between the wind, the guns in the wind, touches it in the wind, today, the today, the today, the today, the today, the gain in the folds and loving the plants.
You think that the monkey is still the Milky Way, or the world of the older of the older of the older Inuit is still a meaning of meaning, or that in Himalaya, the budges still still the spiry, to remember the importance of the Dharm of the Dharm of the Dharm of the Dharm of the Dharm of the Dharm of the world that we are not not in absolute, but it's just a model of reality,
the consequence of a particular adapted choices that our stuck has done, well, a lot of generations that our stuck has done.
And of course, we all share of essential trates.
We all hidden of them.
We are subjects to get initiation.
We have to deaths the death of deaus if we are dogs to be able to deaths if we go and --
We all have an art.
What it hits is the particular rhythm of every culture.
It doesn't matter that they are the Borneo, or the Gorneo, the follows of Haiti, or the Haiti, or the desert Kaiseseven-Sepententrierrither-Sepentries' Curander's heart in the Sahara.
He was my company in the desert a month ago, or a month ago, or a tallevator a walls of Mound's Mound's mother of the world.
All of these populations are teaching us that there are other ways of thinking about other ways of thinking about other ways of thinking about the world.
And if you reflect a moment, it's a concept that it can give you hope.
Inside, the cultures of the world creating a spiritual and cultural life that makes the planet and cultural life that goes on the planet and it's important for the benefit of the planet as a biosphere.
And you can think of this ran as a cultural as an ethnosfer and you can define the ethnoskin, mitty of all the concepts, mittes, ideas, ideas, inspirations, intuitions that are from the heat the human imagination from the heat at the human imagination of consciously.
The ethnos' is the fantastic patrimonizy of humanity.
It's the symbol of what we are and what we can be in how much species;
And because biosphere has been quite consumed as much as it happened to ethnosphery and unfortunately, too much faster.
No biologist, for example, it would say that 50 percent of all the species is the eastern eastically, because it was failed, or -- in the most apocalittic diversity -- and you don't have a pocalittic diversity -- and you don't even even even much of the cultural diversity -- that of cultural diversity of the cultural diversity -- that of cultural diversity --
The indicates all that is, of course, loss loss loss.
When you were born 6,000 linguures on this planet.
A language is not just a language of a vocabulary or a series of rules grammatical.
A language is the sprap of the human spirit is the human spirit.
It's the half with which animates of every culture comes in in the material.
Every language is a forest of the mind a kism -- a spiritual ecosystem of spiritual possibility.
And of those 6,000 languages, as we are sitting in Monterey, at least half of the time is not going to be sushed in the ears of children.
They don't get more teachers to the children, who wants to say, unless than the way to do something that they did.
What is it more than being the silence of being the silence of the last speaks to a language, of not having a way of transmit to the shall of the worst of the children's worth or of anticipate the promise of the children?
This orring is the person in some of the world every two weeks a few weeks a laughter and leading with the ultimate and leads with the ultimate language.
And I know anyone to say, "Is it not that better there?
The world would not be a better place if we were all the same languages?" Benis: then we talk all yoruba. We talk about a lot of Janese --
Let's talk about kogis.
You will will get a tract of what it means is we can talk to their language.
I would like to do a journey through the ethnosferaking --
a little journey in the ethnosphery to give you a above what we're lost.
Most of us forget that when I say, "different ways of existing existing really different ways of existing ways of exists.
We take for example this bimbaby Barasana, in Amazony, the people of the anacony, the people of the anacony, which creates the provide of being the late of the snakic sacries.
It's a population that is not able to distinguish, the blue color blue because the celeste is identified in the forest, which depends the population of the forest, which depends the population of the forest, which depends the population of the older that is the popular of the forest blue because the popular of the forest blue color, which is depending the popular blue color, which is depending the population of the blue color, which is that the population
They have a strange language and a marriage rule -- "exogamically, you have to marry a different person who talks a different language.
All that has roots in the past, yet the particular particular is that in these extremely extent families in which they talk six or seven lings, the mystical matrimonstrengthy matrimonstry is that in these extremely existed maker's one language.
They just just just listening to and then start talking about.
We take one of the most interesting tribes with the most interesting tribes that I've lived Waorani Ecuador nordal, an incredible popular that had the first contatts in 1958.
In 1957 mission has tried a fact-made contact contact with a facal mistakes.
They made them down to the picture that they would report them in a few that they thought that they were love, dimentioning that this population of pluvial forest.
They picked the picture of the ground of a shape or a shape or a shape or a shape, and not finding that they had been treatment, and they killed the five mission of the lances.
But the Waorans didn't kill only the straniera.
They kill between them.
54 percent of the death was caused by their own sex.
We are remarkable to eight generations and we found two of natural death and when we put it on the same way that they were so agreed to a person who died as far as he died as again as the samed as the samed as the same as it is an incredible knowledge.
The hunters were able to recognize the animal from 40 steps and recognize the species.
In the first years in the early '80s, it was a really interesting job when my professor of Harvard asked me if I wanted to go to Haiti to intruphic society with Duvalier and Tonton Mountton Mountain and Tonton Mountain Macoutes, and he was enabled to make the windmic of the veleness of the veleness of the veleness of the veleness of the veleness of the valive
to make a sense of miraculous miraculous and I would have to understand the Voodoo is black and the Voodoo is black black is black black of a miracle of a miracle of a miracle and that Voodoo is a black magic of a miracle of a miracle to the miraculous miracle.
It's quite a metaphor or metaphors of the world.
Very interesting --
If I asked you to tell me the great religions of the world, what would I say?
Cristianity, Islam, Buddismo, Ebrism, etc.
A continent is always left out, thinking that sub-Saharan Africa has no religious ffaiths. And instead of and Voodoo is not the other that the distilled of these very profound religious concept of these very profound religious religious who has been dynamed in the back.
What makes you interesting is that voodor is the intent relationship between life and dead.
So you live in the spirits.
The spirits can be invocated by Grande Aqua, they respond to the randay, and they replace the dead of the vision of that for a short way that for a short device, and the following becomes the deal.
So the voodooists like "You want to white you go to close to talk about God.
We give you the time and become God."
And from the moment that you can do that you guess you lead, how can you do it?
So you see these incredible events that followed events that touch on the state of trances that touch you get a rather demonstration of the power of the mind of the mind of the mind of the mind of the mind of the mind when they catalized in a state of extreme initiitiation.
And over all the populations that I've lived the most extraordinary of the Sierra Nevada Santa March in the Colombia March in the Santa secentrional secentrional area.

I grew up in the forests of the British Britannica creating that the forests had been cut.

I took this picture of aprile in the nordoctory Amazony.
Maybe some of you have heard of ayahuas, the most powerful repertool of the repertootic repertoo.
What makes ayahuass are not the potential of the potential of the substance, but its elaboration. It's composed to two elements.

It's possible to be possible to the earliest replaces with other chemicals that dening the MAO.
Now is the beauty betages that are in this book, they are inbangs of MAO, the same kind of necessary type to potentiate triptamines. The question spontane: in a four-species of plants, how these people are they doing these people are going to find two dead-dead-death means that if you combine in this way, is the danganger to the non-zero-chemical parent?
We use the great euphemism of proof of and mistake error, which can reveal infruttly.
But if we ask India, they will tell us "The plants of us will tell us.

This tribe, Cof, Cofan, has 17 variety of ayahuas's initially in the forest, and that our eyes would come into the same species.
If we ask them as they are asking their pocklew up to us "Think I thought I was not a plant, the rest of the everyone I said, "No."
The solution is: You take the 17 variety of the moon and each of a tone of the rain and each of a different route.
With this doesn't have a Harvard, but it's much more interesting than contare being being the stams.
Now, [unclear] the problem is that the ones of us that have to heart the people who have to get the marine of the history of the history of our real world, and it goes beyond the rest of the history of our real world, and it three.
In fact, the X-century, 300 years, it will not be reminded for its wars or technology, but rather like the age of technology, but rather like the age that we stopped and we delighted the destruction of the planet.
All cultures through the centuries have been involved in a dance for new possibilities of life.
And the problem is not technology.
Indians have no stopped being Sioux when they put from the ark and fresh as a fresh and fresh as the Americans have not to be Americans when they put from the horse and calesses.
It's not the change or technology that threat the ethnosfera. It's the power.
The hard flight of the domination.
And if you give a look at the world, you will find that these aren't destined cultures.

And you can't understand the suffering of the Tibet until you start to the beginning.

We want to live in the world of the monootony or we want to acvil the policy?
The great antropologist Margaret Mead, before he said that his oldest fear was that in our own vision of the world, not only we'll see the whole legal legal of human imagination in the world, not only we'll see the whole legal legacy of thinking about the thought, but a day we will wake up with a dimentor forget even even that there were other possibilities.
And it's humbling our species is existed for 600,000 years.
The Revolution revolution that has given us agriculture, which has made us to be able to detaste with the prose of the seeds of the classroom with the prose of the specialization, and we talk about 10,000 years ago.
The modern world industrialized has 300 years.
That sweet is not suggests that we have the answers to all the challenges that we will have to deal with in the millennia.
When the world of these cultures of the world is asked what to say to be human, they answer to 10,000 different voices.
And it's in these answers that we all risk of being what we are, we all syet. And there is a kind of aware of optimism. And there is a great optimism.
I took this picture of the north of Baffin, when I went to Baffin, when I went to the Inuit, and this man, Olaya, he told me the wonderful story of his grandfather.
The government government has not always been gentlement with the Inuit and the people in the 1950s to be able to be able to be able to be able to reverse our earlier.
The grandfather of this man refused to go to the us.
The family, teming for his life, he brought all of his arms, and all of his attemptes.
You have to know that the Inuit doesn't temt the free, they exploited.
The slits of the slits were made of fish flew in the skin skin skin in caribs.
The grandfather of this man didn't have been intimit night or the basis of the artic or belysh.

In the 19191999 government released to the total control of an therritory of an area of territorial territories of the largest thereexas mitted to put together.
It's their new pathetic. It's called Nunavut.
It's a independent territorial. They Controlln all the minerars.
I have an example of how a national state can reconcilit with his popular to its own popular with his people.
And finally, I think it's quite obvious about who we have been in these remote areas of the planet, I realized that they're not going to be that they don't have any remote of it.
For someone is home.
They represents of human imagination that are rising the dawn of the time. And for us all the dreams of these children, like the dreams of our children, becoming part of our children, become part of the hope.

156 countries transmitted our television canal.
Our magazines are being readed by millions.
Our work is traveling in the ethnosphery to bring our public in places that are going to be able to be able to get out of how they saw and hope, they will be hooked from the central reveal; the world of the antiropologi: the world of existing in a plurh world in a pluralist and multicultural world of a plural and multicultural world of the plural and multicultural reach.
where the wisdom of all the populations can contribute to our collective benefits.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope I call it other than you already heard and I'm going to try to get some links in case doesn't born them.
I would like to start with what I call "the dog" dog."
The official dog?
The official dog's offices of all industrial societies the official societies the official company is the benefitt."
The reason is that you know, from a launch that freedom is in the same a value, is useful, useful, useful, essential for human beings.
The other is the fact that if we are free, each of us can act to do everything that male to do everything that male our benefit without any one who decided to do that all of ourselves
The way to masses the freedom is to be massizzing choice.
More people people had, the more they are free, and the greater is their freedom, the greatest is their freedom.
This is, I think it's so deeply deeply in the society that nobody would dream to put it in the society that nobody would dream to put it in the society that nobody would dream in the society that nobody would dream in the society.
And it's also deeply deeply in our lives.
I'm going to show you some examples of what progress has repossible.
This is my supermarket. It's not particularly big.
I lost a simple note of the condition to insalate conditional condition for insalate
In my supermarket is 175 conditions, without context the 10 varieties of olive and the 12 buns of olive and the 12 bunch of conditional conditional conditional conditional circumstances that nobody of the 175 ready of your gradize constant ination that nobody of your gradiment.
That's what the supermarket.
You go to the electronic store, to buy a stereo: kick -- a CD, radio, plast, radio, plast, the amplificator.
And in this single single store, there's a big audio components -- there's a big audio components of audio.
We can do six million combinations using the components using the components that there are in one negotis;
You have a lot of choice.
Other field: the world of communications.
Once I was a child, you could get all the services, the only only wished phone to be formed by mom Bell.
It was known the phone call, you didn't buy it.
A consequence of that, in the other, was that the phone is that the phone is not a mothers.
These days, they went to the time.
Now we have a variety of phone calls of phone phone cell phones that are cell phones that are cell phone of the phone cell phone cell phone that was actually illitated with cell phone cell phone cell phone cell phone of the phone cell phone cell phone cell phone of the phone cell phone cell phone of phone cell phone cell phones
Here's the cell phones of the future.
My favorite is that in the middle of the birth MP3, cuts of the birth and the bird crycut crycle crying.
If you don't have seen it even seen it in the house below here, you will get a lot of certain that will be going to get there.
And what is the end of the people enter in the negoties and asks this question and the question and the answer is "No."
It's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn't do too many things.
So, in other aspects of life that are much more important than the water, you can see the same explosion of choices.
There is healing health is not going on on the United States that you go to the doctor and the doctor and the doctor what you want to do.
You go to the doctor, and the doctor says, "Okay, we could do A, or B., "A has these benefits and risk "Bs and these risk and risk "Bs and these risk."
You say, "Dr. Dr. Dr. What should I do to do?"
And the door says, "A has these benefits and these risks and the Bs of these risk."
"What do you want to do?"
And you rebrought to him, "Dr. if she was me, what do you do?"
And the doctor, "But I'm not leise."
The result of the malato," expression that makes it a beautiful thing.
But it is not a smoke and the responsibility of making decisions from someone who knows something, which is the doctor, to someone else who knows anything -- and almost certainly is sick -- and so not in the ideal condition, and so not in the ideal condition, the patient.
There's a huge market products of drugic products -- you know, you would say, if you think about it doesn't make a sense, because we can't buy them.
But if we can't buy them, why do you have them public icize?
The answer is that they want to donurture we call the the doctor to make the doctor to change the reception.
And that is that fundamental as it is our identity is a question of choice, as you see in this journey -- we don't want to force. We don't want to be a baby. We don't want to be more identity; we don't don't want to invent a identity; we need to invest a identity; we need to invent a matter of identity; we don't want to invent children.
And we can reinventate how many times us are aggrade.
That means that every morning in the risky of people want to be able to be a person to be.
I respect to the family, a time the perspective, a time the perspective, and it was that married the most preme possible to make the most preme possible, and it was going to get the most preme possible.
The only true choice was with chemicals -- not when we don't even get what to do later.
On the day, it's really really to play out.
I think of intelligent students very smart students and I do 20 percent of work than a time.
And because they're not less to be less to be less to be less to be less diliges.
But why are they implemented to ask yourself, "should I get marries or no? I should do this now?"
"Would I get marries late? I have to think before you think of the kids or care?"
I'm interrogatives of logic interrogants.
And they try to answer these questions, even though this implementing doesn't completely, the compitors that I asseat to my exame.
And they have to really ask it. I'm very important questions.
Now, the job: we're lucky, as a subtolineava, because technology allows us to work every day, from the planet, from the Hotel Rand-Rand-Rand-Rand-Rand-Randand-
And in the parents, there's a corner, and I didn't tell anyone who doesn't say anybody where where the WiFi works.
I don't say that because I want to use it.
What does this amazing freedom of choice that we have about work? Is it we have to continuously decide, continuously decide, if we have to work or not.
We can go to the kid play, with the cell phone in a pocket in a pocket in one pockets, and the notebook, typically, on the knee.
And even though they're all sort, every minute that we see our son roll, we're also asking the headline, we're also asking this call?"
"Do I have to answer this email? I have to emboy?"
And even when the answer is "no," all this makes the experience of your son is a very different row from what would would be in other conditions.
So, from any part of the we look at things and large objects, materials and style of life, life is a question of choices.
Obnce it was this: Ovo, there were some possibilities, but it was not a choice.
The world today looks like this -- the world is it is, "Is it a good thing, or negative, or negative?
The answer is the Sun.
The good lies we know all that is that I will talk about those negative things.
All this choice behavior two negative effects of people.
The first paradoxically, is that produces instead of free.
With many options between the options that choices, it becomes very difficult to do it.
And I offer a meaning example of the volunteer of flighting.
A link of my colleagues had access to the giant deep data, the giant societies of pension, with about a million clients in 2,000 different companies in 2,000 different companies in 2,000 companies.
What she found is that for every 10 solutions that are coming out of the most of the solutions that are going to be about 24 percent.
With 50 sources -- there's 10% in less than deflection in less than the deaths when they're available only 5. Why?
Because with 50 sources of founds that choose is very difficult to decide, and the choice comes to the question.
And to ask question, and still ask questions, and of course, the questions is not going to get it.
You know that this is not just that these work from old to the food for the dogs because they won't have enough money, wants to say that the decision is so that they also lost the fundamental funding of the data.
Not participating, they're losing to 5,000 dollars per year from the dator of the works, which would be well to shoot them.
So paralysis is a consequence of having too many choices.
And I think that makes the world like this.
"And to end up the eternitrom -- ketchup, senape or maion?
You would like to take the right decision if it's for ethnity, right?
You don't want to choose the wrong and you don't want the wrong condition to the wrong condition
So this is the first effect. The second is that even though we can avoid paralyside, and we are less soddisded by the result of how we would be stayed with less options between less than we would be with less options between which they choose to them.
And this for several reasons.
One of these is that with many conditions of the people who choose and it's not perfect -- it's easy to imagine that you could have to make a different choice that would be better than it would be better than it would be better than alternative imagined us to be better imagined by the choice, and the remulti-remulti-re-dunddisphery of the decision of the decision of the decision of the decision and the remaintaining remand remand remand the remand the remulti-re-haul remise redition of the remitted remit
even when it was a good decision.
More choices are the easier to details anyone details that is insoddisfacturing option.
And yet, there's what economists call cost-opportunity to call cost-opportunity.
DGilbert has a very good stamattine as the values that we give things to the things that we give to things to what we share we going to talk to what we share them.
And after that, when you have a lot of options possible, is easy to represent the characteristic of the alternative shot and be less soddisc that you have choice.
Here's an example. I get with all those who are not New York.
But that's what you probably think you probably know.
There's this copy to Hamptons.
A place of slow down.
Spipes splendid. Ocket. It's all for them.
Not anything. But what he thinks he is, "Well, malediption, is Again."
"All of my neighbors in Manhattan is a vid."
"I could just parking your hous."
And it goes two weeks that you can get the idea that it's losing -- every day -- the possibility of parking where it wants.
The cost-opportunity is decreasing the soddisphation for what we have, even when the choice was excellent.
And the more are the options that we have to be considered, the more of the characteristics are going to come out of the opportunity.
Here's another example.
This is a lot of things.
It talking about living the moment, and maybe the living slowly.
But the most important point is that anything you choose to do the others of you don't do the others.
The things that we don't choose have a lot of attractive attracts that can make less what we do.
Third point: the spiral growing for waitative.
I tried it on my skins by buying a new jeans.
I can get nearly jeans.
Once jeans were just a typical type, you buy them and dress were sweet and they were sweated, just after you had them a lot of times, they were going to go good.
So, I went to buy a couple of jewels had gone and said, "I need a couple of jeans, this is my cutt."
The committed me to say, "Do you want slim fit, relaxed fit, relaxed fit?"
Do you want to do cernier or with the bottonies? "Stonehed" or "acid" or "?
"Do you want to get a rot?"
"Would you like to get a stret? Ble blah -- he was he was he was going to electric them.
I was beard, and after a little bit of I could say, "I want the guy -- which was the only one guy -- that was not a little bit of what I was going to try to all the malean '60s, then I went out of the negoties, and then I went out of the negoties, with the best couple of jeans that I had ever had.
It was the massive choice I had the better.
But I felt worse.
Why? I wrote a book to understand it.
The reason I was I dream is that with all that choice was that I had all that choice were altism at was perfectly.
At the beginning I had waitative minimes. I didn't expect to do anything when he was just a while, but when you saw 100 different guys had to be perfect a bone-guy had to be perfect.
What I had watched was good, but not perfect it.
After having paragoned that I was just just to what I was trying to do for the expectations.
The addition of the people doesn't make the expect of people to increasing the expectations that these are respect to the options of options that are respect to the options of the options of the options that these are respectacular options that these are respect to increase.
And that will promise less soddisfation, even when the results are good --
No one in the world of marketing if it makes it matter.
Because if you know what I'm talking about.
The truth looks like that.
"You were better when you were worse is the worse is that when you were worse is that when you were worse is that when you were worse to evolve.
On the world that we live -- opulent inmentioned initial inner citizens with the perfeation of the perspective, the maximum of the expectancy of expectations.
You never have a surprised because your expectations, my expectations, my expectations, you have ingiant it.
The secret of happiness -- what you're here -- is "Basasasked." "Yeah, you want." "Yeah, you want."
I mean, small moment -- small moment -- which is really married and my wife is really sposited and it's really stupend.
I couldn't do better, I didn't have to do my better, I didn't have to do my better.
But you get it is not always a bad thing.
And finally, a consequence of the buying a couple of jeans when you have only that jeans are that when you're not satis; and you ask you why?
"Who is responsible?" The answer is clear.
The world is responsible. What could I do about it?
When you have hundreds of jeans, and you buy a insoddisfacting, and you ask you who is responsible for the responsible that you are responsible for you to be you.
You could have to do better.
With hundreds of varieties have unavailable of varieteties have been successful.
So when people get decisions, even though the result is valid, they feel insoddisphones, and they damage their own own itself.
In the last few years of the industrialized world in the industrialized.
I think a significant factor -- not the unique, but important -- of this wave, the important -- of this depression is that people have deludent experiences,
And when they have to explain this situation they think that the hitself is them.
So the final result is that we are better, objectively, but we feel worse.
Let me tell you about it.
This is the official dog; that's what we all take for good and it's not true.
There is no doubt that a little choice is better than that they don't have to have to have a lot of choice that much choice is better than a little bit.
There's a critical value value value of it.
But I'm sure we have overcome from a piece of the piece of the level that the improves improves improving our life.
Now, from political point -- I have almost finally -- from policiy point of view, the nurture point of view.
What it allows all this choice in industrial societies is the material wealth society.
There are many places in the world, and you know about the world is that they don't have too much choice.
The problem is that they have too few years old.
So the factory of which I'm talking about is a malaria of moderns, rich societies that we are in moderns, recic societies
And what makes you depress and angry is this: Steve Levitt talked about how those expensive and sat seats are inuts. It's a lot of inutioughs.
I mean, these choices, complicated and dispendioses, it's not just inuseless.
I'm even deleterious to be right.
They make a worse of it.
If some of what in our societies societies that in our societies had a lot of choice was reversed in those where people have too much of their lives, but even the name of the nine that we can get to improve to be in those where people have too much choices.
This is what economists call a paretyan improvement improvement.
a redistribution of redistribution. It's good to everyone -- not just to the poor -- because of this choice in the excess that it goes down.
To end up, "Foom -- you can become all that I want,
You know, people in culture, you think about it -- what makes that fish?"
"It's obvious that you can't make anything in a mouth of vetrow."
"A fall-imagination vision of the world --
and I was in the beginning.
But then, I realized, I realized that that that fish fish the moon.
Because the reality of the fact is that if you sent the mouse of the mouth, in a way that "everything is possible." You get the freedom.
If you rop your mouth in a way that all you can get possible to decrecreation.
You get paralyside, and you get the benefit to be wealth.
Everybody needs a spher.
This is almost certainly too stretch -- maybe even fish for fish, and certainly for us.
But the absence of some symbolic skin, is a recipe for infelicity and temo, I am for the infelicity and temo, for the rovine.
Thank you for heart.
