<unk> year, I showed these <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk>, which for almost three million years had the size of the United States <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> of 40 percent.
<unk> this <unk> the <unk> of the problem because it's not <unk> the <unk> of the ice.
<unk> <unk> <unk> is, in some sense, the heart <unk> of the global global warming system.
It's <unk> <unk> and <unk> in summer.
The next <unk> will be a <unk> <unk> in the last 25 years.
The <unk> <unk> are <unk> in red.
You see, it's <unk> to the blue <unk>.
That's the ice in <unk>, which is <unk> in summer.
You can see that the <unk> ice <unk>, of five years or more, is like the blood, which here is <unk> from the body.
In 25 years it's been been <unk>.
This is a problem because the <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> around the ocean, where there are huge <unk> of <unk> <unk> that, <unk>, <unk>, are <unk> in <unk> from the <unk>.
<unk> to the <unk> <unk> <unk>, that amount of <unk> <unk>, that could <unk>, <unk> this point of not <unk>.
In some <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is already <unk> from water.
The <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> with a team <unk> <unk> last <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>! <unk>: She's good. The question is if we <unk> it even.
One reason is that this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from the north.
This is a river in <unk> <unk>.
It had never <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This is the <unk> river, in the <unk> <unk>.
If you want to know how the <unk> <unk> <unk> on <unk>, here is where the <unk> <unk>.
These <unk> are <unk> <unk>.
<unk> other part of the planet: <unk>, the largest <unk> of ice on the planet.
<unk> month, <unk> scientists <unk> that the <unk> of ice <unk> is in <unk>, and that <unk> on some <unk> <unk>, is particularly <unk> in <unk>.
<unk> at six feet of the <unk> level, like <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk> of ice, you see new <unk>, which a few years ago.
40 percent of the world's population <unk> of the water <unk> from that <unk>.
<unk> <unk>: this <unk> is the <unk> of <unk> water in this city.
<unk> is <unk>.
But when you do that same happens to the <unk> water.
<unk> <unk> <unk> is 40 percent.
<unk> <unk> are in crisis.
<unk>, as you have read, they're <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> in the world leads to a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> are <unk> to a normal <unk> out of the normal <unk> and <unk>.
Sometimes, over the last 30 years to <unk> <unk>.
This is a <unk> <unk>.
If you look at it in the <unk> context you can see the <unk>.
In the last five years, we've been <unk> 70 million <unk> -- 25 million <unk> in the oceans every day.
Look at the <unk> area, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and both <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, and both the <unk> of the <unk>, where there's a <unk> <unk> of oxygen in the ocean.
The <unk> of global <unk>, together with <unk>, which is 20 percent, is the use of <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> is a problem, and <unk> is even worse.
The United States is one of the two countries with <unk> <unk>, together to China.
And it's <unk> to build many other <unk> <unk>.
But we're <unk> to a <unk> of direction.
This is the projects <unk> over the last few years and some <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
<unk>, there's a <unk> <unk> in our country.
<unk> <unk> and oil <unk> <unk> <unk> million dollars in the last year to <unk> <unk> <unk>, which is a <unk>.
<unk> picture me something --
<unk> <unk>, in <unk>, where I live, there was a <unk> <unk> billion <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
Maybe you've seen it on <unk>.
This is the largest flow of <unk> in America.
It's happened around <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> of one of the <unk> <unk> was this.
<unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk> is a <unk> <unk> and happy.
It's <unk> here in America, and grow our economy.
<unk> <unk> is <unk> and <unk>.
It's <unk>, <unk> and <unk> <unk> it.
<unk>: From the <unk> here, most of the <unk> <unk>.
The largest society <unk> on the <unk> is <unk> <unk>. This is his <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk> -- Al <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> -- they don't know what they're talking about.
<unk>: So the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This is one of them, one part.
<unk>: <unk>: At <unk> we see the <unk> changes as a <unk> <unk> to our business.
So, our <unk> is <unk> a lot of money in a <unk> <unk> to make public public and <unk> the truth of <unk>.
In fact, <unk> is not <unk>.
We think it's <unk> -- it's also a good <unk>.
So we don't know about climate change.
We should do.
<unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk> -- you've heard a lot of <unk>.
So we <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk>.
<unk>! <unk> are a little <unk>, but this is the sound of the <unk> technology.
<unk> <unk> is between the <unk> <unk> of global <unk>, but the <unk> technology of <unk> that you see changes everything.
Let's look at this one is the <unk> technology of <unk> <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk> to the economic issue and the national security <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> America is in crisis; America is a crisis; the economy, national <unk>.
The <unk> that <unk> all: our <unk> from <unk> <unk>, like <unk> and oil <unk>.
Now, but there's a new, <unk> solution to <unk> it.
<unk> America: 100 percent of <unk> energy, in 10 years.
A plan to <unk> America at work, <unk> more <unk>, and help <unk> global warming.
<unk>, a solution that we're going to <unk> to solve our problems.
<unk> America. <unk> more.
<unk>: This is the last.
<unk>: It's about <unk> energy to America.
One of the most <unk> ways of <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> that <unk> our planet.
<unk>: The future is here. <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> 2: <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> America. It's time to be <unk>.
<unk>: A old <unk> <unk> says, "If you want to go to <unk>, go alone.
If you want to go far, you go. "
We must go far, fast.
Thank you very much.
<unk> year at TED, a <unk> on <unk>.
And we're <unk> to <unk> about how the machine works.
So here we go. And for the people who had no <unk>, <unk> is the largest scientific experiment ever <unk> -- <unk> miles of <unk>.
His <unk> is to <unk> the conditions that were in less than a <unk> <unk> of the universe -- to <unk> million times a second.
That's just <unk>.
This is the <unk> machine.
<unk> these <unk> <unk> inside the <unk>.
This is what I work on. It's called <unk> -- it's <unk> <unk> feet and it's <unk> feet.
This is an <unk> picture of <unk> in building in so you can see the <unk>.
<unk> last year, we <unk> the car for the first time.
And this picture was <unk> <unk>.
It was <unk> <unk> in the control of <unk>.
It's an image of the first <unk> of particles that had done all <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk>, with a part of the <unk>, and <unk> particles inside the <unk>.
In other words, when you put that picture the 10 <unk>, I <unk> that the machine <unk>, which is a great <unk>.
I don't know if it was this to make us more or this, when someone <unk> on Google and <unk> that page it was this.
That means that we've had a <unk> impact over to the scientific <unk>.
<unk> a week later, there was a problem with a car, had to just these <unk> here -- these <unk> <unk> <unk>.
These <unk> <unk> <unk> when the car works in the <unk> <unk>.
Now, the <unk> <unk> of you <unk> the <unk> and <unk>, "It's not true. I'm too <unk>."
And they can do that because when they're very <unk> to become the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
So <unk> degrees <unk>, at a <unk> temperature temperature <unk> to that the <unk> of the space between stars, these <unk> can bring that <unk> to the <unk>.
In one of the <unk> <unk> in <unk>, there was a <unk> <unk>.
So the <unk> <unk> <unk>, and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a electric <unk>.
This was the <unk>.
Now, this is even more <unk> if you think that these <unk> <unk> more than 20 <unk>, and that <unk> of about 30 <unk> <unk>.
They <unk> about 50 <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, which we did.
We <unk> them and <unk>.
They're all <unk> to their place.
<unk> the end of <unk> <unk> is going to be new <unk>.
We <unk> it, and we try to get some data to <unk> or <unk>, and continue so our <unk> to find out what the <unk> are <unk> that <unk> the universe.
Now, of course, in a way, these <unk> <unk> the <unk> of science and engineering <unk>. It's easy to <unk>.
I think that the fact that it's so hard, the fact that it's so hard to go beyond <unk>, I think is the value of things like <unk>.
I'd like to end with the words of a <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, who, <unk> <unk>, in <unk> of the <unk> experiments of his <unk>, his <unk> was Michael <unk>, said, "No, so <unk> that it's so <unk> about the <unk> of human mind as <unk> as <unk> as the <unk> that the ideas of science are <unk>, and that no new <unk> <unk>.
Thank you.
I want to start <unk> <unk> to when, from children, <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> like <unk> and <unk>, <unk> and <unk> and <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, actually, to think and <unk> problems.
The <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> to the way that we <unk> most of the world around us.
So, from <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of our <unk> with <unk> objects, together to my <unk> <unk>, and my <unk> <unk> <unk>, I started <unk>: "And if we use a computer, instead of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> as a computer, <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> an information with <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> an information with <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> an information <unk> with both of the hands,
and we're going to <unk>?
The question was so interesting that I decided to explore the answer, building <unk>.
In words, a <unk> is a <unk> computer <unk> as a <unk>.
In words, a <unk> is a <unk> computer <unk> as a <unk>.
You can <unk> them with their hand, they can say, "<unk>" <unk> "their movement and have a screen and a <unk> <unk>.
But <unk>, they're <unk>, like <unk>, you can just <unk> it.
<unk> are the example of a new tools to <unk> digital information.
And as they become more <unk>, <unk> of their movement, other, and as they become more <unk>, <unk> of their movement, other, of how we <unk> them, we can explore new and <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> with some simple example.
This <unk> is <unk> to show you: if you put it in a direction, the video <unk> <unk>. So if you can put it in a direction, the other side, it's going to go back.
These <unk> <unk> are <unk> of the other people.
If you <unk> them, it's <unk> what they're going on.
If they're <unk>, you know, you can <unk> it a little bit.
If they're <unk>, you know, you can <unk> it a little bit.
They also <unk> their movement and <unk>.
We had <unk> that one of the interesting <unk> of the interesting <unk> of the <unk> was that we could use <unk> <unk> on data, for example, "<unk> a color like it was a <unk>.
In this case, we have three <unk> <unk> as <unk> and <unk> can <unk> to <unk> the color in the <unk>, where it <unk>.
and I can <unk> to <unk> the color in the central to the <unk>, where it's <unk>.
If we're too too much, we can <unk> it a little bit.
There are also <unk> possibilities of <unk>, like <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, where people can try things very quickly, and <unk> the results of <unk>.
Now, I'm --
This is a sequence of <unk> that I do with a <unk> program.
Here we have a <unk> of words that is half <unk> and <unk>.
<unk>, at all of the <unk> <unk> a letter on every <unk>, <unk>, every <unk> <unk> <unk> a letter on every <unk>, and as I decided to <unk> words, he <unk> on a <unk>.
Then, after about 30 seconds is <unk>, and you have a new <unk> of <unk> and new <unk> <unk>.
Thank you.
Here we go to the <unk> <unk> <unk>, I did <unk> them in the way that I <unk> them and <unk> a video.
They're very <unk>.
And one of the interesting things of <unk> is that you don't have to give the <unk> of people.
It's just saying, "<unk> of words, and they know exactly what to do.
Here it's one of the people who <unk> it.
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, right.
It actually wanted to <unk>.
It was just <unk>, for him.
Now, this is a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We wanted to build a tool for the <unk> of <unk>. He's <unk>.
It can <unk> new characters in the scene, <unk> their <unk>.
It can <unk> new characters in the scene, <unk> their <unk>.
So it's <unk> out the sun.
<unk>: The sun is <unk>.
David <unk>: Now he brought a <unk> in the scene.
<unk>: The <unk> <unk>.
<unk> work! Yes!
So <unk> the <unk> and <unk> can <unk> the characters --
<unk>: <unk>!
<unk> their story.
<unk>: <unk>!
<unk>: It's a story with <unk> <unk>, and it can decide how to do it.
<unk>: It's a story with <unk> <unk>, and it can decide how to do it.
<unk>: <unk> away, <unk>.
<unk>: The last example that I have time to show you is a tool, made of <unk>, to <unk> and <unk> music.
is a tool, made of <unk>, to <unk> and <unk> music.
The <unk> here are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> of these four different <unk>, and you can choose which you use.
You can also <unk> these <unk> in a sequence <unk> <unk> to your <unk>.
And they just <unk> a <unk> <unk> a sound and a sequence.
These are the effects that you can control of live, like <unk> and <unk>.
It <unk> it to a particular sound and then <unk> to <unk> it.
And then there are the <unk> effects of time and <unk>, that's <unk> to the entire sequence.
<unk> how it works.
<unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> in two <unk> <unk>, <unk> in a series, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> another <unk>.
Now, we're going to take a <unk> line.
<unk>: <unk> now <unk>...
<unk>: And now I'm going to <unk> the <unk> to <unk>, so I can control the effect of alive.
<unk>: <unk>: <unk> the entire sequence <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> the time on one hand, or on the other.
<unk>: And now we're going to <unk> the <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>: <unk> the sequence of <unk>.
So I don't have to <unk> it before, but I can <unk> it, <unk> more <unk>.
And now, finally, I can <unk> the entire sequence <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is to build new <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to how we work and body.
And today, I had time to show you one of the results of this <unk>, and some possibilities that we try to bring out of the lab.
The concept that I want to <unk> is that it's <unk> this new generation of <unk> objects to <unk> with media, which <unk> information in our world in the way we want.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the <unk> with all of you.
I'm a <unk>.
<unk> books is my <unk>, but it's more than this, of course.
It's also love and love <unk> and my <unk>.
And I don't expect it to change.
But, he said, something particular happened in my life and my career, which led me to <unk> the whole relationship with this work.
The particular thing is that I <unk> wrote this book, this <unk> called "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
And the result of it is that everywhere I'm going to be <unk>, people <unk> me as if I was <unk>.
<unk> -- <unk>, <unk>!
I'm going to be <unk> and say, "You don't fear of you can't be able to do better than that?
You're not afraid to write all of the life that we can create a book that could <unk> to someone? "
<unk> that could <unk> to someone? "
It's <unk>, you know.
But I remember going to be worse, except for me that more than 20 years ago, when I was saying to people -- I was an <unk> -- I wanted to be a <unk>.
I <unk> the same <unk> <unk> from fear.
And people say, "Don't you know I don't know that I was going to be successful?
You don't fear the <unk> of <unk> you <unk>?
You've never fear to do this <unk> all of life without anything else comes out and you'll ever come out and to die on a <unk> of <unk> dreams with the <unk> with the <unk> <unk>? "
So, you know.
The answer to all of these questions is, "Yes."
Yes, I fear of all those things.
I've always had fear.
And I also fear of many other things that people couldn't <unk>.
Like <unk> and other things happen.
But, as much as much as I thought I was, and <unk> <unk> me is why?
Is it <unk>?
It's <unk> that anybody who who <unk> <unk> to be <unk> by a job that you feel <unk> to do.
But what's so <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> in a way that other <unk> <unk> <unk> in a way that other <unk> do not?
Like my father, for example, he was a <unk> <unk>, and I don't remember one time in his 40 years of activity where asked him to be <unk>?
It was never -- that <unk> of <unk> John, how does it go?
<unk>'t that way, <unk>?
<unk>, engineers <unk> as a group of engineers, in <unk>, <unk> the <unk> of being <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We <unk>, we have enough this <unk>, and not only <unk> but <unk> of all of all of this <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And it's not <unk> else that looking at the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that, only in the <unk> century, <unk> young and often for them.
And the ones who don't have <unk> to be really <unk> by their <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, before he died in the last <unk> said, "My book <unk> me a little more <unk>." He <unk> about the work of their lives.
But we didn't know when we <unk> it to say because we've heard these things so long that somehow we have completely <unk> and <unk> the <unk> that creativity and <unk> the <unk> that creativity and <unk> are somehow <unk> and <unk> that art at the end.
And the question I want to tell you all here today is you agree with this idea?
It's going to be good for this -- because it's also <unk> by a <unk> distance to me.
I think it's <unk>.
And I think it's also <unk> and I don't want to <unk> <unk> in the next century.
I think it's better to <unk> our great <unk> to live.
And I certainly know that, in my case -- it would be very <unk> to start <unk> to that <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in which I'm am in my career.
<unk> -- <unk>, you look at it's pretty young, I'm 40 years old.
I still have about four <unk> <unk> in me.
And it's very <unk> that anything will happen now in the world, and then it's going to be <unk> by the world's <unk> after the last <unk> success of my last book.
<unk> <unk>, because we're all <unk> or less friends here -- is <unk> that my greatest success is to my <unk>.
Oh, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
You know, this is the kind of thinking that brings a person to start <unk> <unk> to the nine nine in the morning and I don't want to do it.
I'm going to keep doing this work that I love.
So, the question of it becomes, how?
And so it seems to me, after many <unk>, that the way to work to write is to create a <unk> <unk> <unk>, OK?
I have to have to be a distance of <unk> between me, which I'm <unk>, and the natural <unk> to which I'm <unk>, and <unk> for the last year that I would <unk> to look through time, looking through the time, looking for other society to see if you could have better ideas and see if you could have better ideas and see if you could have better ideas and <unk> <unk>.
about how to help people <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity.
And that research has brought me to the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
It's because they <unk> in <unk> and then <unk> back.
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> -- people don't believe that <unk> creativity from men, OK?
And he thought that creativity was this <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> to men from some <unk> and <unk>, for <unk> reasons and <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> these <unk> <unk> of <unk> creativity.
<unk>, <unk>, <unk> to have a <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> from <unk>.
The <unk> were in the same idea, but they would have that kind of spirit of no <unk>.
It's <unk>, because the <unk> didn't really know that a <unk> was someone particularly smart.
<unk> that a <unk> was this kind of <unk> <unk> that <unk> literally <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, and that <unk> out of <unk> the artist, and <unk> out of <unk> the artist and <unk> the <unk> of that artist's work to <unk> the work of the artist and <unk> the <unk> of that work.
<unk> <unk> <unk> you from that <unk> -- that's the distance I'm talking about that <unk> you from your <unk> <unk>.
And everybody thought that was so that I was <unk>, right?
So, artists had come from <unk> things, like the too <unk>, you know?
If your work was <unk>, you didn't get the <unk>, all <unk> that was <unk> <unk> <unk>.
If your work <unk>, it wasn't all your <unk>, right?
<unk> <unk> that was your <unk> to be a <unk>.
And so people are <unk> <unk> creativity in <unk> for a long time.
And then the <unk> <unk> and everything <unk>, and we <unk> this great idea; we put the human being at the center of the universe above all of the <unk> and the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and no <unk> space to <unk> from <unk>.
This was the principle of <unk> <unk> and people who think about <unk> <unk> creativity.
And for the first time in history, he <unk> to <unk> this, or that artist at a rather <unk> than a person with <unk>.
And I have to say, I think it was a big <unk>.
I think of somebody, a simple person to believe that they're like a <unk> like a <unk> like the source, <unk> and <unk> of all the <unk> <unk>, <unk> and <unk> and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, and <unk>, <unk> and <unk> is a responsibility for a <unk> <unk> human <unk>.
It's like to someone to <unk> the sun.
<unk> and <unk> the <unk> and <unk> all of these <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk>.
And I think it was this pressure to have <unk> artists in <unk> 500 years.
And if that is true, and I think it's true, and that question is it becomes, and right now?
Can we <unk> it?
We can go back to a <unk> understanding of the relationship between humans and <unk> <unk>.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we can't <unk> 500 years of thinking about a 18 minutes.
And probably there are people in the audience who <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on their <unk>, <unk>, you know that <unk> people <unk> <unk> on their projects.
You probably don't know all about this thing.
But the question I'd like to say to you is -- why not?
Why don't we <unk> this way?
Because it makes more than anything that I've ever heard to explain the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> process.
A process that's <unk>, as anyone who ever <unk> to do something -- so, basically, all here -- knows, you know, you don't have <unk>.
And in fact, it can <unk> <unk>.
I did this meeting <unk> with the extraordinary <unk> <unk>, who has now 90 years old, but it was a <unk> for life and said that during his <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> out in the <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> out in the <unk> <unk>, <unk> it out in the <unk> <unk>.
He said, "It's like a <unk> <unk>.
And that <unk> to <unk> out of her <unk>.
I could get it, because he was <unk> the earth under his feet.
And he thought he had one thing to do to that point and was of words, "<unk> as a <unk>."
And so he went to home and he came up with this <unk>, and he wouldn't have to take a piece of paper and a <unk> enough <unk>, and a <unk> enough <unk>, and <unk> it on the page.
<unk> times not <unk> to be fast enough, so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> the <unk> through the <unk> and she would <unk> through the <unk>, and she would <unk> through the <unk>, and she said, "she" another one. "
And then there were those times -- this <unk>, I never had -- there were moments in which he was <unk>, right?
So, he was <unk> at home and was looking for the paper and the <unk> <unk> through, and he had a <unk> in their <unk>, and he was <unk> in, and he was, she was, she was like she <unk> with the other hand and <unk>.
He <unk> his <unk> from the tail and <unk> it in his body and the <unk> on the page.
And in these cases, the <unk> would be <unk> on the <unk> page, and <unk>, but the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
So when I <unk> it -- it's <unk>, it's exactly <unk> to my <unk> process.
Not a <unk> process -- I'm not a <unk>!
I'm a <unk>, and my way of <unk> is; it <unk> at the same <unk> every day and <unk> and work and <unk> on top of it.
But even me in my <unk>, I <unk> against that thing, sometimes.
And I would say that many of you will <unk> the <unk>.
You know, even if the work and ideas <unk> me <unk> from a <unk> source I couldn't <unk> it.
And what is this thing?
And how can we <unk> it in a way that we don't have to be able to <unk> your head?
And so, as it is, the best example I have is the <unk> <unk> <unk>, which I've been <unk> different years ago for a <unk>.
I was talking about this, and you know, <unk>, for the <unk> of life has been the <unk> of the artist <unk> <unk>, <unk> these species of <unk> totally <unk>.
But then <unk>, he was <unk>, and one day when he was <unk> on a <unk> <unk>, he <unk> everything.
<unk> fast and everything of a <unk> <unk> of this little <unk> of <unk>, that comes into his head as <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, but he doesn't know how to <unk> it.
It's not a <unk> of paper, it's not a <unk>, it's not a <unk>.
So, it starts to hear this kind of old <unk> <unk> in him, "I'm going to lose, and <unk> <unk> <unk> from this song.
I'm not <unk> enough and I can't <unk> it. "
And instead of going to <unk>, they <unk>.
He <unk> the whole process and made something completely new.
He just <unk> the sky and said, "<unk>, you see I'm <unk>?"
"<unk> you can write a song now?"
If you really want to <unk>, you'll get it in a <unk> moment, when I can <unk> care of you.
<unk>, <unk> to <unk> else today.
<unk> <unk> <unk>. "
And his process <unk> will come after that.
Not the work, it's still <unk> as always.
But the process, and the <unk> <unk> that <unk> had been <unk> when <unk> the <unk>, the <unk> that came from him <unk> <unk> that out of him, <unk> that problems and <unk> <unk> back where he was, he had no thing and <unk>.
but it was <unk> this <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> a conversation between <unk> and this <unk> thing that was <unk> and <unk>, but it wasn't <unk>.
So how much <unk> history <unk> to change a little bit of how I was <unk> and I was <unk> at a time.
This idea, I was <unk> when I was <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>," and I'll go to one of those <unk> <unk> in which we all work on something and we don't get up and you start thinking it's going to be a <unk>, that's going to be the <unk> <unk>, which is going to be the <unk> book.
Not just <unk>, just <unk> book.
And we're going to start thinking about this project.
But then I <unk> to <unk> that <unk> in the air and <unk> us.
So I <unk> my face up from <unk> and <unk> my <unk> to a <unk> <unk> corner of the room.
And I said <unk>, "<unk>, what, we know, if this book is not going to be <unk>, it's not going to be <unk>, right?
Because as you see, I'm <unk> everything I have, I have no longer than this.
So if you want it to be better, you have to do your part.
OK. But if you don't do it, you know what, I'm not going to <unk> anything.
I started to write the same because it's my job.
And I would like to be <unk> that I've been <unk> to do my <unk>. "Because at the end is like this, OK -- <unk>, OK -- <unk>, <unk>, OK -- <unk> -- <unk>, <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk>, and music that I would <unk> on for hours and hours to the <unk>.
And they were always <unk>, because the <unk> were <unk> and <unk>.
But every once so much, <unk>, something <unk>, and one of these <unk> artists actually <unk>.
And I know what I'm talking about what you've got to do, because I know that you have seen a <unk>.
It was like <unk>, and the <unk> <unk> through a kind of <unk> and not <unk> through a kind of <unk> and he wasn't <unk> <unk> <unk>, like the <unk> <unk> before, but everything <unk>.
And all of a sudden it doesn't just like a human.
But it's <unk> out of <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk>.
And when this <unk>, at the time, people <unk> what was, he <unk> him with his name.
<unk> your hands and <unk> <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, God," God, "God."
That's God, you know.
<unk> <unk> -- when the <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk>, I <unk> this <unk> with them and <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, which you can hear in the <unk> or in the <unk>.
In <unk>, when a artist has done something impossible and <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> -- a <unk> of God.
And it's <unk> because we need to do it.
But the problem comes up the next day, for <unk> itself, when you <unk> and <unk> that are 11 <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> of God <unk> there's no more.
It's just a <unk> with great <unk> to <unk>, and maybe never <unk> to <unk> it to that <unk>.
And maybe no one <unk> the name of God still <unk>, and what is that it has to do with the rest of his life?
It's hard.
This is one of the most <unk> <unk> to do in a <unk> life.
But maybe it doesn't have to be so <unk> if you can't believe, <unk>, that the most <unk> <unk> of your being <unk> from you.
But we just <unk> that you get data from a <unk> source of this <unk> part of your life that you have to <unk> someone else when you're finished.
And, you know, if we think it's all change.
And so I started <unk>, and it's certainly what I <unk> it for several months during the <unk> of the book that I was going to, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> of my success.
And what I have to continue to <unk> when I feel like this is, I'm not afraid.
You're not going to be <unk>.
<unk> <unk> for your part, any could be.
If your work is <unk>, it's <unk>.
If the <unk>, you'll get to you <unk> <unk> <unk> some kind of <unk>, for one moment through your <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>! "
You do the same your <unk>.
And "<unk>!" <unk>! "<unk>."
I think, and I think it's <unk>.
"<unk>!" <unk> "<unk>" to you, "<unk>!" <unk> "
Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk>: <unk>!
As you know, I've been talking about some of these projects on the human genome, what can <unk> and the discovery of new genes.
Now we're <unk> a new <unk>: we started <unk> biology and now from that digital code, we're <unk> in a new <unk> of biology, <unk> and <unk> life.
We always tried to make big questions.
"What is life?" It's something that many <unk> have <unk> <unk> that I think have <unk> to understand at different levels.
We tried different <unk>, <unk> to the <unk> terms.
We're <unk> for almost 20 years.
When we <unk> the human genome <unk> to go from the <unk> world of biology to the digital world.
Now, do we <unk> the way to <unk> life, or create new life from this digital universe?
This is the map of a little <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, which is the species from the <unk> genome in the lab as small as the <unk> genome.
And we tried to reduce the genome to <unk> one even smaller.
We're able to <unk> a <unk> of about 500 genes that are here.
But when we look at his <unk> map, it's <unk> simple than our.
<unk>, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can <unk>, one at one time, it's very <unk> that can bring a <unk> cell.
So we thought that the only way to <unk> this <unk> to <unk> some of these questions <unk>.
And so we started the <unk> of "<unk>, can we <unk> a <unk>?"
Can the chemical <unk> of making these big molecules that we've never been able to create before?
And in case we can make a <unk>?
<unk> is just a <unk> piece of <unk> material.
The speed with which we're able to <unk> life is <unk> <unk>.
Our ability to write the <unk> code, instead, <unk> slowly, but it's <unk>.
And our most <unk> the results to bring it on a <unk> <unk>.
We've been <unk> over 15 years ago.
The process has <unk> a lot of <unk>, <unk> with a <unk> <unk> before they <unk> experiments.
But we found that that <unk> of DNA is very difficult.
There are <unk> of thousands of cars in the world that <unk> little <unk> of DNA, <unk> <unk> <unk>, and it's a <unk> process. The more <unk> is long, more <unk> there are.
So we had to develop a new <unk> to <unk> these <unk> and <unk> the <unk>.
And this was our first <unk>, <unk> from information of the <unk> genome.
It's a little <unk> that <unk> bacteria.
We designed <unk>, <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> a <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
The interesting part is when we took this piece of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> it into the bacteria, the bacteria have <unk> to read this code, and <unk> the <unk> particles.
<unk> <unk> <unk>.
I talked about recently with <unk> members of the <unk> industry that they certainly <unk> this model.
They've been <unk> more than you.
And we think this is a situation where the software can actually build its own <unk> in a <unk> system.
But we could do the bigger things.
We wanted to build the entire <unk> of the <unk>.
It's more than <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
So we thought about <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the virus, so that we can change the <unk> to understand what the <unk> <unk> of a <unk> cell.
The <unk> is <unk>, and if you <unk> information in a computer, it's got to be very <unk>.
When we <unk> this genome for the first time in <unk> <unk>, it was a <unk> for every 10 10 <unk> <unk>.
We found, <unk>, <unk> <unk>. If we were using that original <unk> sequence never <unk> states in <unk> it.
One part of the process is to design <unk> <unk> 50 <unk> that <unk> with all the other <unk> of the other <unk> of <unk> <unk> to build smaller <unk> <unk> together.
<unk> elements here.
You probably have read that <unk> us from <unk>.
<unk> <unk>: We have a <unk> code on four <unk> <unk>: A, <unk>, <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> of those <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> about 20 <unk>, and there's a <unk> order for every <unk>.
So we can use the code for <unk> words, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
What we did at the beginning was <unk>.
Some of them were <unk> by the fact that it wasn't <unk>.
We designed these <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk>.
There are <unk> that <unk> them and <unk> them.
And we started <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
But every step, we have made these <unk> in <unk> so that we're <unk> to create a very <unk> <unk> <unk>, as you'll see in a minute.
We're trying to <unk> the process.
So, this looks like a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
When you start these very <unk>, very <unk> than 100 <unk> <unk>, you don't get <unk> directly into the <unk> <unk>.
It's <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
So we have <unk> other <unk>.
<unk> of another <unk> called <unk> <unk>, which in biology <unk> to <unk> DNA <unk> the <unk> that we can <unk> the <unk>.
Here's an example.
This <unk>, called <unk> <unk>, can <unk> three million <unk> <unk>.
You can see in the <unk> <unk> like his <unk> is <unk>.
<unk> <unk> -- 24 hours it's <unk> exactly how it was before.
<unk> thousands of organisms that are able to do that.
These organisms can completely <unk>.
We had to live under <unk>.
I'm absolutely sure that life <unk> in space, and it's <unk> to find new <unk> of water <unk>.
Actually, NASA has shown that this is happening.
This is an image of the <unk> that we built using these <unk>, just using the <unk> with the <unk> design of <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> <unk> them.
This picture was not <unk> with a <unk> <unk>, but with a <unk> <unk>.
It's such a <unk> <unk> that we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk>.
These are pictures that <unk> a period of about six seconds.
This is the <unk> that we've done a little time ago.
It's more than <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's the largest <unk> of a <unk> structure ever <unk> by man.
It's got a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
If you <unk> it with a <unk> 10 <unk>, we'll have to <unk> this <unk> code.
Now, how do we make it work? How can we <unk> it?
<unk>, <unk> is a <unk> game is a kids.
It's a little bit more <unk> when you use bacteria.
It's <unk>, even when it's about <unk> cells like our: you can just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> another, which is almost the process of <unk>.
In <unk>, we <unk> the <unk> is instead of <unk> inside the cell, but we have <unk> <unk> that we are able to do a <unk> <unk> <unk> of a <unk> <unk> of a <unk> cell to another and <unk>.
We <unk> a <unk> <unk> from a species.
<unk> are different as <unk> as men from <unk>.
We have <unk> some more <unk> in a way that we could decide which to choose this <unk>.
He <unk> <unk> with the <unk> <unk>.
And when we put it in the cell was <unk> and <unk> our <unk> <unk> the new <unk> went into the cell.
And we had to say that we couldn't go beyond it, but we tried to <unk> more in there.
This is one of the major <unk> of evolution.
We found that <unk> species have <unk> a second or a third <unk> <unk> somewhere, <unk> in a second thousands of new <unk> to that species.
So who thinks about evolution as one <unk> at one time that <unk> didn't understand the biology.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> that was in the cell, we didn't have one.
The <unk> <unk> that we <unk> is.
It's <unk>, and it <unk> the other <unk> as <unk>, <unk> it, and we <unk> with only only the cell and the new <unk>.
It's become blue because of the genes we've <unk>.
And in a short <unk> of time, all the <unk> of a species are <unk>, and it <unk> of all of the <unk> in a new species, <unk> on the new software software that we <unk> in the cell.
All the <unk> are <unk>, the <unk> are <unk>, and when you <unk> the <unk> code exactly what we've <unk>.
Now, this may seem <unk> <unk>, but we <unk> the software, we can change things quite <unk>.
Now, I've already <unk> that you don't talk about <unk> -- but of progress at three million years and a half million years of evolution, and I already said that maybe we're going to create a new <unk> <unk> species on this <unk> process that we <unk> new species on this digital process.
Why do that?
I think it's pretty <unk> when we think about our <unk>.
We're going to spend six and a half billion people to <unk> billion people in the next 40 years.
Just to give one example. I was born in <unk>.
Now there are three people on the planet to <unk> <unk> in <unk>; in 40 years, there will be four.
We're <unk> problems now to find food, <unk> and <unk>, <unk> and <unk> and <unk> for six billion people.
We'll have more <unk> to do it for nine billion.
<unk> more than five billion <unk>, more than 30 billion <unk> of <unk>.
That means 100 million <unk> a day.
When we try to find <unk> <unk>, or any kind of process to <unk>, it's going to be a huge challenge.
<unk> we have to realize all of the <unk> of CO2 from these materials that <unk> in the atmosphere.
<unk> <unk> <unk> for the future of <unk> all over the world, we have a <unk> with about 20 million genes, and I like to think that are <unk> <unk> for the future.
The <unk> industry <unk> only one <unk> about a <unk> of <unk>, and think of how many different things come out.
Our <unk> here is <unk> data from reality and our <unk>.
Now we have <unk>, because of these <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> to create what we call <unk> <unk>.
We're able to build a big robot that can produce a million <unk> a day.
Think of <unk> these 20 million genes or <unk> to try to <unk> <unk> <unk> to produce <unk> or <unk>, new <unk>, we can change, with a small team and create more <unk> biology now that in the last 20 years of science.
And it's just a standard <unk>.
We can choose to <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This is a <unk> of some <unk> software that we're working on to be able to <unk> and design species on the computer.
Well, we don't know how they will be.
We know exactly how their code <unk>.
We're going to take on the <unk> generation.
You saw in the <unk> that <unk> <unk> was a <unk> experiment.
We <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> as soon as <unk> as <unk> as <unk> or different kinds of <unk>.
But the only way that biology can reach that biology to have a big impact <unk> <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the <unk> would be <unk> CO2 in matter before we're working on to design cells that can reach that we can reach that first <unk> <unk> in about 18 months.
<unk> <unk> with CO2 is a <unk>, but in our <unk> of <unk> around the world, we found different <unk>.
This is a <unk> that we've <unk> in <unk>.
<unk> in the ocean, about <unk> feet of <unk> at the temperature of <unk> water.
<unk> <unk> by CO2 using hydrogen <unk> as a source of energy.
We're trying to understand if we can <unk> CO2, that can be <unk> with <unk>, <unk> that CO2 in <unk>, to drive this process.
So short, we think that we might be able to <unk> what is the basic question of "Life" is "We, <unk>, we <unk> the <unk> goal to <unk> the whole <unk> industry.
<unk>. If you can't do that TED, where can you?
It's a <unk> source of energy.
<unk>, we're working for the same <unk> to create <unk> <unk>.
You've seen this year with flu, we're always back a year and with a dollar in less when it's about finding the <unk> right.
I think that can change building <unk> <unk> in <unk>.
This is how the future future could start to look <unk>, now, the tree of evolution, <unk> the <unk> with bacteria, <unk>, <unk> cells.
We're so much about how people people.
Our purpose is to make enough to live enough to try to <unk> <unk>. Thank you very much.
<unk> <unk>, I'll show you the <unk> possible, some <unk> work, some <unk>, new technology, that we brought to <unk> <unk> to a <unk> almost a year ago. This is <unk>.
It's a environment where you can <unk> both local at local level that you can <unk> with a huge amount of <unk> data.
Here we're seeing <unk> <unk> <unk> with a kind of <unk> <unk> and <unk>, for a fast <unk>, <unk> the images like we want.
And it doesn't matter how big much of the information that we see, how big these <unk> of data, or images.
Most of them are common photographs, but this is a <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of <unk>, and <unk> in the <unk> of <unk>, and <unk> in the <unk> of 300 <unk>.
It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that <unk> the <unk> of a system like this is the number of <unk> on your screen at any time. It's also a very <unk> architecture.
This is a whole book, example of data, not images.
This is <unk> <unk> <unk>. Every <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk>.
To <unk> that it's <unk> and not images, we can do something of the kind of thing, to make a real <unk> of the text <unk>, not of a picture.
It could be a way of <unk> to read a book.
You don't know.
This is a <unk> example. It's a number of <unk>.
Every picture is the beginning of a <unk>.
And it gives you a lot of pleasure and the good experience of reading the real <unk> version of a <unk> or a <unk>, which is a <unk> <unk> of a <unk> <unk>.
We also did something with the corner of this <unk> <unk>.
We created a <unk> <unk> <unk> much than what you use in a normal <unk>, and we <unk> you from the <unk> content.
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk>, you can see it here.
Or other models, or even <unk> <unk>.
And that really <unk> some of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of space on the screen.
We knew that this <unk> <unk> to the <unk> and other similar <unk>, not <unk> to be <unk>.
Of course, <unk> is one of the most <unk> <unk> for this kind of technology.
And I don't want to lose time, if not say that we have <unk> <unk> to give even in this field.
These are all the streets in the United States <unk> <unk> up on a NASA <unk> picture.
So now we're going to do something else.
This is actually in live on the web; you can see it.
It's a project called <unk>, which <unk> two different technologies.
One is <unk> and another <unk> is a <unk> research computer at the very interesting computer that's made by <unk> <unk> <unk>, with the <unk> <unk> <unk>. A <unk> <unk>.
And it's alive in the web, <unk> <unk>.
You can see when we do this kind of <unk>, where we can go from an image to another and have this kind of experience <unk> <unk>.
But the <unk> <unk> of the images here has actually <unk> a meaning.
The <unk> of the computer <unk> these images, so that they <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> that are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> have been <unk>. Here you see some <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk>, and these things have all <unk> <unk> <unk>.
I don't know if I have time to show you some other environment.
There are much more <unk>.
I want to go directly to one of the <unk> <unk> of <unk> and this <unk> from a <unk> <unk> of <unk> that we've done for the first time I <unk> to show you what's going to be <unk> behind this technology, the <unk> <unk>. And it's not <unk> so much <unk> the <unk> that we've put in the Web.
We had to <unk> some <unk> <unk> and so forth.
This is a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> images of kinds of <unk>, other <unk> and <unk> and so forth. <unk> <unk> <unk> a picture that's discovery is discovery <unk> to this model.
So, they're all <unk> <unk> and you're all <unk> at the <unk> level in this way.
And it's possible to <unk> this <unk> way.
You know, I would never have thought of end up to work for <unk>.
It's very <unk> to <unk> this kind of <unk> here.
I think you can see that it's a lot of different kinds of <unk>: from the <unk> to the <unk> <unk>, a <unk> number, <unk> together in this environment.
And if I can, I can look for the most <unk> <unk>.
Many of them are <unk> <unk>, etc.
<unk> <unk> a series of photographs -- <unk>.
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We can go from <unk> to <unk> to <unk> <unk> in this environment.
The <unk> point is that we can do things with social environment. This is <unk> data from <unk> from the entire memory <unk> of how to <unk> the earth, from the <unk> point of view and <unk> all that data together.
All of those pictures become <unk> together, more than the <unk> of the parts.
You have a <unk> model of the entire <unk>.
Think about this as <unk> of the work of <unk> <unk> <unk> on Earth.
It's something that <unk> in <unk> of <unk> as people <unk>, and <unk> for who are <unk> <unk> with <unk>.
Their pictures are <unk> with <unk> <unk> by other people.
If someone comes the idea of <unk> all of these <unk> <unk>, the name of my picture of the <unk> <unk> <unk> all of this data, and I can use it as a <unk> <unk> <unk> in that space, in that <unk>, using the <unk> of anyone else, and have a social experience of <unk> and <unk>.
Of course, a <unk> of this is <unk> <unk> extremely <unk> of every part of the earth, <unk> not only from <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
Thank you very much.
CA: I understood? What's your software <unk> us to do is that at some point, in the next few years, all the photographs that's <unk> <unk> together?
<unk>: Yes. What's doing is basically <unk>.
It's creating <unk>, if you want, between images.
And it's doing it <unk> the content of images.
The thing becomes very interesting if you think of the <unk> information that many of these images are <unk>.
As you do a <unk> <unk> and <unk>, you <unk> a <unk> and the <unk> on the web page has a lot of information about the images.
Now, what happens if that picture <unk> to all your picture?
So the amount of <unk> <unk> and the amount of <unk> <unk> that <unk> is really enormous. It's a <unk> effect of the network.
CA: <unk>, it's really amazing.
<unk>: Thank you very much.
One of the <unk> <unk> when you <unk> and one of the <unk> research <unk> is that we can live in who has <unk> the <unk> <unk>, between who <unk> the past the wind, the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> of plants.
You might think that <unk> <unk> <unk> still <unk> <unk> <unk>, or that <unk> <unk> <unk> are still <unk> <unk> <unk>, or <unk>, <unk> <unk> still the <unk> <unk> of <unk>, or <unk>, <unk> <unk>'s <unk> <unk>, and the idea that the world in which the world in which we live in in the sense, but it's just a <unk> model of <unk>, but it's just a <unk> model.
the <unk> of a particular <unk> of <unk> choices that our <unk> did, well, or a lot of <unk> does.
And of course, all of course, <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>. <unk>.
We're <unk> <unk>.
We have to <unk> the death <unk>, so we don't know if we <unk> and <unk> --
We all have an art.
What <unk> is the <unk> of the song, the <unk> of the <unk> of every culture culture.
It doesn't matter that's the <unk> <unk>, or the <unk> <unk> <unk>, or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, or a <unk> in the <unk> <unk>.
He was my <unk> journey in <unk> a month ago, or a <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk>, on <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>'s mother of the world.
All of these <unk> <unk> us that there are other ways of <unk> <unk> other ways of to think, other ways of moving in the world.
And if you <unk> a moment, it's a concept that can give you hope.
<unk>, the <unk> of the world create a <unk> of life <unk> and <unk> that <unk> the planet, and it's important for the <unk> of the planet, as the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And you can think of this <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and you can <unk> the <unk> of all the <unk>, dreams, <unk>, <unk>, ideas, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, ideas, <unk>, <unk> <unk> in being from human imagination.
<unk> is the <unk> <unk> of humanity.
It's the <unk> of what we are and what we can be as <unk> species.
And <unk> <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, for example, <unk> that 50 percent of all species has been or is on the <unk> of <unk>, because it's <unk>, or <unk> -- in the <unk> of <unk> diversity, and not even <unk> <unk> -- that's <unk> diversity.
The <unk> of this is, of course, the <unk> <unk>.
When you're <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on this planet.
A language is not only <unk> from a <unk> or a series of rules.
One is the <unk> of the human spirit.
It's the middle with which <unk> of every culture is coming in in the material world.
Every language is a forest of the mind, a <unk>, a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And of those <unk> <unk>, as we're sitting here at least half, it's no <unk> in the <unk> of children.
They're no longer <unk> to children, which means less than something, which is already death.
What's more <unk> than being <unk> by <unk>, of being <unk>, the last <unk> to talk to a language, not to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> or <unk> the children of <unk>?
This <unk> <unk> is the state of someone in the world's <unk> every two weeks: every two weeks: every two weeks, a <unk> <unk> and <unk> the <unk> of a <unk> language.
And I know that someone of you say, "<unk>'t that much better?
The world would not be a better place if we all do the same language? "<unk>, then we're all going to talk about it.
<unk> <unk>.
<unk> of a <unk> thing means that not to talk about their own language.
Today I'd like to give you a journey through <unk> --
a small journey in <unk> to give you a <unk> of what we're <unk>.
Many of us will say that when I say, "different ways of <unk>," I mean, "I really different ways of <unk>.
<unk> for example, this <unk> <unk>, in <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, which <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from the river <unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's a <unk> that's not able to <unk> the blue color from green because the <unk> <unk> is <unk> in the forest, where the <unk> is <unk> in the forest, that we <unk> the <unk>.
They have a <unk> language and a <unk> rule, <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And all of that <unk> in the past <unk> is that in these families families that they talk to six or seven <unk> because of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> no <unk> <unk>.
It <unk> and then we start talking about it.
And I <unk> one of the most interesting <unk> I've lived in, the <unk> <unk> <unk>, an amazing <unk> that had the first <unk> in <unk>.
In <unk> five <unk>, they <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
They've been <unk> from the top of the <unk> that <unk> <unk>, <unk> that this <unk> of the <unk> forest <unk> never seen anything.
They <unk> the picture from the land, the <unk> to <unk> a form or a <unk> and, not <unk>, <unk> nothing, and they <unk> the five <unk> with the <unk>.
But the <unk> didn't only <unk> the <unk>.
They're <unk> between.
<unk> percent of the <unk> was <unk> by themselves.
We were <unk> eight <unk> and we found two <unk> <unk>, and when we <unk> to know, they <unk> that one of them was <unk> so dead <unk>, and then <unk> it.
The <unk> were able to recognize the animal <unk> 40 <unk> and to <unk> the species.
I was early <unk>, I had a really interesting task when my <unk> <unk> <unk> me if I could go to <unk> <unk> me if I wanted to go to <unk> <unk> between <unk> society and <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> to do <unk>.
To give a sense of <unk>, I should understand <unk> culture, and that <unk> is not <unk> <unk>.
It's rather a <unk> <unk> view of the world.
Very interesting.
If you ask to <unk> the great <unk> of the world's big <unk>, what would you like?
<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, etc.
A continent is always left out, thinking that Africa has no <unk> <unk>. And instead of <unk>, and the <unk> is not anything else that <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
What makes interesting about the <unk> is the <unk> relationship between life and death.
So <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> can be <unk> by the <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> to the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> to the live of the <unk> <unk> in the alive in a way that <unk> the <unk> becomes the <unk>.
So, the <unk> <unk> to say, "<unk> you go to <unk> God.
We <unk> in the <unk> and <unk>. "
And from the moment that you're <unk>, is the spirit that <unk> you, how can you get <unk>?
So, it's <unk> to these incredible events: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a rather <unk> of the power of the mind of the power of the mind that's <unk> <unk>.
<unk> all the <unk> that I've lived with which I've lived with is the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, in the <unk> <unk>.
<unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> that once <unk> on the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
In a blood continent <unk>, this <unk> never been <unk> by <unk>.
In <unk>, I'm <unk> with a <unk>, but they're <unk>.
<unk> <unk> are <unk> from <unk> to <unk> families to <unk> <unk>, and live <unk> in a world <unk> and <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> to the <unk> <unk> for 18 years old.
Two <unk> of nine years <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>.
For that time, they're <unk> to the values of their society, values that <unk> their <unk> and only their <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or to say <unk> <unk>.
At the <unk> of this amazing <unk>, they're <unk> out and for the first time in their lives, at 18 years, see a <unk>. And in that moment of the first <unk>, when the sun <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk>, everything that have learned in theory of <unk>. <unk> <unk> <unk>, everything that have learned in theory <unk>. The <unk> <unk> does a <unk> <unk> <unk>. <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> does <unk> <unk> <unk>.
"<unk>? <unk> like I said.
It's <unk>. Now it's <unk>.
They call <unk> <unk> and say that we, <unk> <unk>, we are the <unk> of the world's <unk>.
This <unk> level is extremely important.
When we think of <unk> <unk> and the <unk> environment and the <unk> <unk>, and the old history of the <unk> <unk>, which is a <unk> concept in his <unk> or maybe <unk> and say that these <unk> are <unk> to Earth.
The <unk> <unk> are not <unk> or <unk> <unk> from <unk>.
There's no space for these things in the <unk> <unk> or in the <unk> <unk>, but because of time and <unk>, have created a <unk> of the Earth <unk> <unk> not on the concept of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, but on a <unk> <unk> <unk>. It's <unk> by human <unk>.
What does that mean?
I mean that a <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> that the mountain is a <unk> spirit that <unk> its <unk> will be a <unk> <unk> different, and will have a very different relationship with the mountain or that place than a <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> that a mountain of <unk> <unk> to be <unk>.
<unk> <unk> is <unk>.
What's interesting is the <unk> that <unk> the relationship between <unk> and the natural world.
I grew up in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> to be <unk>.
That made me a human being different from my friends who believe that <unk> are the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> in the world, <unk> that <unk> during the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
If we can <unk> that these <unk> can create reality, <unk> different, we could start understanding some of their <unk> <unk>.
I <unk> this picture in <unk> in <unk> <unk>.
Maybe some of you have heard about <unk>, the most powerful <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk>.
What makes <unk> <unk> is not the potential <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, but his <unk>. It's <unk> by two elements.
On one hand, this <unk> <unk> <unk> a series of <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
<unk> the only <unk> a <unk> <unk> that <unk> a little bit of <unk>, but it's <unk> with <unk> <unk> of a <unk>'s family <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This <unk> <unk> <unk>, very similar to <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
If you ever see the <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> the <unk> that's <unk> <unk>.
<unk> that <unk> on the <unk> is a little bit of how to be <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a sea of electricity. It doesn't make a <unk> of reality.
I often <unk> with my <unk>, Richard <unk> <unk>, the man who <unk> the <unk> was <unk>, with his discovery of the <unk> <unk> in the '<unk>.
My <unk> is not <unk> these <unk> as a <unk> because if you can't tell anybody to be <unk>. <unk> <unk>. <unk> <unk> <unk>, but they can't be <unk> because they're <unk> by a <unk> that's <unk> in the <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
It's possible to <unk> only if you <unk> with other <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk>.
Now, the <unk>: <unk> that are in this <unk> are <unk> <unk>, the same <unk> to <unk> the <unk>. <unk> question: in a <unk> of <unk> species of plants, how these <unk> <unk> <unk> two <unk> <unk> not like that, but if you <unk> in this way, they create a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk>?
We use the great <unk> of <unk> and <unk>, which can <unk> <unk>.
But if we were to the <unk>, we'll get "The plants talk about it."
What does that mean?
This <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the forest that <unk> <unk> in the forest, and that our eyes <unk> in the same species.
If you look at them as they <unk> their <unk> <unk> us "<unk>" <unk> "<unk>" <unk> "No."
The solution is: you take the <unk> <unk> in a night <unk> <unk> <unk> with a different <unk>.
With this not <unk> to <unk>, but it's much more interesting than <unk> <unk>.
Now, the problem is that the ones who have <unk> <unk> <unk> them, but somehow <unk> to the <unk> <unk> are <unk>, but somehow <unk> to the <unk> of the history of the world than our real, and it's <unk>.
In fact, the <unk> century, <unk> <unk>, not <unk> <unk> for his <unk> or his <unk> <unk>, but rather as the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> diversity and <unk> and <unk> the mass of the <unk> diversity and <unk> <unk> and <unk> the planet. Now the problem is not the change.
All of the <unk> <unk> have been <unk> in a <unk> for new possibilities of life.
And the problem is not technology.
The <unk> <unk> have no <unk> to be <unk> when they put <unk> <unk> and <unk> like <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk>.
It's not the change or technology that <unk> the <unk> of <unk>. It's the power.
The <unk> <unk> of <unk>.
And if you look at the world, I'll see that these are not <unk> <unk> to <unk>.
They're <unk> creatures and <unk> <unk> out of the <unk> forces that go beyond their <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> --
a <unk> <unk> <unk>, in <unk> <unk>, a <unk> that has been <unk> <unk> in the forest to a generation ago, and now we go to the <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk>, where you can see the <unk> <unk> from the <unk> <unk> that looks <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>,
We start <unk> with <unk> <unk> with the <unk> <unk> to the forest.
Or, in <unk> case, <unk>, are disease that are <unk> with the <unk> discovery of <unk>.
If we <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk>, where I'm doing a lot of research, you'll see the <unk> <unk> of political <unk>.
As a <unk>, <unk> physics <unk>, is <unk> at the <unk> level, but <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk>'s life <unk>, not only is <unk>, but <unk> <unk> in certain <unk>, because it's part of the development of the development of the <unk>.
And you can't understand the <unk> of the <unk> until you go out of the beginning.
I <unk> <unk> miles in China through <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk>, <unk> to <unk> with a young <unk>, but only got to <unk> <unk>. I realized what's behind.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> million people are <unk> by <unk> during the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The father of this guy was <unk> to the <unk> <unk>.
which means that it was <unk> at the <unk> of the Chinese times.
<unk> <unk> is <unk> with <unk> <unk> during the <unk> that led to <unk> <unk>.
My mother was <unk> and his <unk> was to be <unk>.
It was <unk> of <unk> in <unk> at the age of two <unk> <unk> under his <unk> because he couldn't live without him.
The <unk>, who did the same, was <unk> in <unk>.
One day she <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> and, for this <unk>, was <unk> to the <unk> work for seven years.
<unk> pain can be <unk>, but the <unk> spirit of <unk> is from <unk> present.
And then it <unk> to a choice.
<unk> we live in the world's <unk> or want to <unk> the world <unk> of diversity?
The great <unk> <unk> <unk>, before he died said that his greatest fear was that she was that, in our going to go to this <unk> view of the world, not only <unk> the entire entire <unk> of human imagination to a <unk> <unk> <unk> of thinking, but a day we <unk> from a <unk> <unk> <unk> that there were other <unk>.
And it's <unk> to <unk> that our species is <unk> for <unk> years.
The <unk> <unk>, that <unk> us us to agriculture, that <unk> us, <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> with the <unk> <unk> with the <unk> <unk> with the <unk> of <unk>, and we talk about <unk> years ago.
The world <unk> <unk> 300 years old.
That <unk> story, I didn't tell me that we have the answers to all the challenges that we can <unk> to come.
When the <unk> <unk> of the world is asked what it means to be human, <unk> with <unk> different <unk>.
And it's in these answers that we all <unk> the possibility of what we are: sort of <unk>, that has to make all the <unk> and all the <unk> can <unk>. And there's a lot of <unk> <unk>.
I <unk> this picture on the north of <unk> <unk>, when I went to <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk>, and this man, <unk> me the wonderful story of his <unk>.
The government <unk> was not always <unk> with the <unk> <unk> and in the '<unk> to <unk> our <unk>, we <unk> them to <unk> our <unk>.
The <unk> of this man <unk> <unk>.
The family, <unk> for his life, <unk> <unk> all the <unk>, and all his <unk>.
You should know that <unk> don't <unk> the cold, we <unk> it.
The <unk> of <unk> <unk> fish were made in <unk> fish <unk> in <unk>.
The <unk> of this man did not <unk> from night or <unk> <unk>.
It's <unk> away, it <unk> the <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> in their hand. When I did it <unk>, they <unk> it <unk> a <unk>.
He <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk> <unk> and when <unk> <unk>, he <unk> a dog.
He <unk> the dog and created a <unk>, with the <unk> <unk> <unk> created a <unk>, and he's <unk> on the <unk>, <unk> <unk> in <unk>.
<unk> to talk about nothing? [<unk>] And this, in different ways, [<unk>] is the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all the <unk> <unk> of the world.
<unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> government <unk> to <unk> the total <unk> of an area of <unk> bigger <unk> in California and <unk> together.
It's their new <unk>. It's called <unk>.
It's a <unk> <unk>. It's all the resources <unk>.
One <unk> example of how a <unk> can <unk> with his <unk>.
And, finally, I think it's pretty <unk> at least at least at the <unk> areas of the planet, <unk> that they realize they're not at all <unk>.
For someone is home.
<unk> <unk> of human imagination that <unk> to the <unk> of the days. And for us all, the dreams of these children, as the dreams of our children, become part of the <unk> of hope.
<unk>, we <unk> <unk> that <unk> never <unk>.
<unk> that <unk> --
[<unk>] [<unk>] but we believe that stories can change the world, and maybe we are the best <unk> to tell the stories of the world. Every month our <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.]
<unk> <unk> our <unk>.
Our <unk> are <unk> by millions of people.
Our work is <unk> in <unk> to bring our audience to bring our public to <unk> <unk> from <unk> from <unk> how much they saw and <unk> <unk> from which <unk> <unk> from <unk> how much they saw and <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of <unk>: the world's <unk> in diversity, and we have to find <unk> <unk> <unk> in a <unk> world.
that we have to <unk> <unk> to our <unk> <unk>.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope <unk> other that you've heard and <unk> some <unk>, in case not <unk> them.
I want to start with what I call "the <unk> <unk>."
The <unk> <unk> of what?
The <unk> <unk> of all <unk> society <unk>. The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>: "If we want to <unk> the <unk> <unk> of our citizens." The way to do it is to <unk> the freedom <unk>. "
The reason is, on one side, in fact that freedom is in itself, is <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> for humans.
<unk> else is in fact that if we're all <unk>, each of us can act to <unk> to do everything that we <unk> our <unk>, without any <unk> in our <unk>, without any <unk> in our name in our.
The way to <unk> the freedom is to <unk> choice.
The more choices are more than people have, more <unk>, and more of their <unk>, is their <unk>.
This is, <unk> <unk> <unk> in society that no one <unk> to <unk> in <unk>.
And it's also <unk> <unk> in our lives.
I'm going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible.
This is my <unk>. It's not particularly big.
I <unk> a simple note about the <unk> to <unk>.
In my <unk>, there are <unk> <unk>, without <unk> the 10 <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> and the 12 <unk> <unk> that you can buy for you a huge amount of <unk> in the <unk> <unk> that no one of <unk> already <unk> in your <unk> <unk>, is <unk>.
Here's what <unk> is the <unk>.
Then you go to the <unk> store to buy a <unk>: <unk>, <unk> <unk>, radio, <unk>, <unk>.
And in this <unk> store, there's a lot of a <unk> number of <unk> <unk>.
We can make six and a half million different <unk> using the <unk> that there are in one store.
<unk> <unk> that there is <unk> choice.
<unk> <unk>: the world of <unk>.
Once I was a child, when I was a child, we could all the <unk> <unk>, <unk> that were <unk> by <unk> <unk>.
It's <unk> the phone, you're not <unk> it.
One <unk> of that, in the other one, was that the phone <unk> never.
These days they went.
Now we have a <unk> <unk> <unk>, especially <unk>, especially in the <unk>.
Here's the cell phones of the future.
My <unk> is in the middle, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk>.
If you're not yet you've seen it in the <unk> store, you're very <unk> that soon you're going to be <unk>.
And what is at the end happens is that people <unk> in <unk> and <unk> this question. And you know, what is the answer? The answer is, "No."
It's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn't make things.
So, in other <unk> of life that are much more important than <unk>, the same <unk> of choices.
<unk> <unk>: It doesn't happen in the United States you're <unk> from <unk> and the <unk> <unk> you what you have to do.
Instead, <unk> from the <unk>, and the <unk> says, "OK, you could do it." Or you go, "he's got these <unk> and these <unk>." What do you want to do? "
You say, "<unk>, what would you want to do?"
And the <unk> says, "<unk>," <unk>, "<unk>," <unk>, "<unk>,"
"What do you want to do?"
And you say, "<unk> if she was me, what would you say?"
And the <unk> says, "But I'm not her."
The <unk> we call it "<unk> <unk>" <unk> "<unk>", "<unk> <unk> that makes it look like a <unk> thing.
But in fact, it's not that one <unk> the weight and the responsibility of the decisions from someone who knows something, <unk> the <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, somebody who doesn't know -- and it's certainly not <unk> -- and so it doesn't know, and it's certainly not about -- and it's certainly not <unk> to make the patient.
There's a huge <unk> of <unk> products, <unk> to people like me and you, that if you think of it has no sense, because we can't <unk>.
But if we can't <unk>, why would we get them?
The answer is that they want to <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> of so <unk>, as it is <unk> a <unk> of choice, as you see in this <unk>. "We don't want to <unk> kids. We don't want to <unk> kids. We don't get an <unk> <unk>: we need to <unk> it.
And we can <unk> how many times we <unk>.
which means that every <unk>, <unk>, you have to decide that kind of person.
<unk> to the family and <unk>, a common time perspective, <unk> <unk> almost anyone, was that <unk> us as soon as possible, and <unk> to <unk> the children as soon as possible.
The only choice was with the one of the <unk> of the <unk> of what to do after.
<unk>, everything is really to play.
They're going to be very smart, and they <unk> their 20 percent <unk> than a time.
And not because they're <unk>, not because they're <unk> <unk>.
But why are they <unk>, <unk>, "<unk> <unk> or not? <unk> it?"
"<unk> <unk> later? I have to think about <unk>, or <unk> career?"
They're <unk> <unk>.
And they try to answer these questions, even if this <unk> doesn't get the <unk> that <unk> and not get a good <unk> to my <unk>.
And they have to do that. They're really important questions.
Now, the work is <unk>, as <unk> <unk>, because technology <unk> us to work every minute, every day, every day, every day, every day, every <unk> of the planet, <unk> that from the <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, there's a <unk>, and I won't say anybody, where the <unk> works.
I don't tell you, because I want to use it.
What does this mean, this amazing freedom of choice that we have about work? Is that we must decide, <unk> at all time, if we have to work or not.
We can go to our son to play <unk>, with the <unk> in a <unk>, the <unk> in the other, and the <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
And even if I all <unk>, every minute that we see our son, <unk> the <unk>, we're also <unk>, "I have to <unk> this call?"
"<unk> to this <unk>? I have to <unk> this letter?"
And even when the answer is, "not," all of this makes the <unk> experience of your son very different from what would be in other conditions.
So, from any part of it, <unk>, small objects and big objects, life is a matter of choices.
Once the world was this: <unk>, there were some possibilities, but it wasn't all about choice.
The world of today is <unk> to this: <unk> is a <unk> thing, or <unk>?
The answer is <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> we know all, so I'm going to talk about the <unk> <unk>.
<unk> that choice <unk> two effects <unk> on people.
The first one, <unk>, is that <unk> <unk> instead of <unk>.
With a lot of <unk> between which you choose, it becomes very difficult to do it.
I'll give you an example of a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
A <unk> of mine had access to <unk> data, <unk> <unk> society, with <unk> <unk> <unk>, with about a million <unk> <unk> in different companies.
What she discovered is that every 10 solutions that are <unk> in more <unk>, the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> two percent.
<unk> 50 <unk> <unk>, there's 10 percent less than <unk> when they're <unk> available. Why?
Because with 50 <unk> <unk>, it's <unk> difficult to decide, and choice is <unk> to <unk>.
And <unk>, and still <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and of course <unk> never comes.
<unk> that doesn't just mean that these <unk> <unk> food to <unk> because they don't have enough money, it wants to say that decision is so <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
They're not <unk>, they're <unk> to <unk> <unk> for year from work, which would be well <unk> to <unk>.
So <unk> is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> choices.
And I think that's going to be <unk> the world.
"And finally, do the <unk>: <unk>, <unk> or <unk>?"
It really <unk> the decision, if it's for <unk>, right?
You don't want to choose the wrong <unk>, and <unk> the wrong <unk>.
So this is the first effect. The second is that even if we can <unk> <unk> and make a choice, at the end, we're less <unk> from the <unk> of how to <unk> states with <unk>.
And this for different reasons.
One of them is that with a lot of <unk> between which, if you <unk> one and not perfect, it's easy to imagine that you could make a different choice that would be better. And what's the thing is that the <unk> <unk> <unk> us to <unk> the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> by the <unk> <unk> of the decision,
And even when it was a <unk> decision.
The more choices there are, <unk> more easy to <unk> than any <unk> <unk>.
<unk>, there's what <unk> call.
Dan <unk> very well <unk> like the value that we give to things that we take <unk> with.
<unk> everything else, when there's a lot of possible, it's easy to <unk> the <unk> <unk> and be less than the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Here's an example. I'm <unk> with all of the ones that are not in New York.
But that's what we probably do.
There's this <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>. <unk> day. It's all for them.
It's not going to be <unk>. But what he thinks he's, "Well, <unk>, it's <unk>."
"All my <unk> <unk> are <unk>."
"<unk> <unk> <unk> right in front of the house."
And it goes two weeks from the idea that it's <unk> -- every day -- the chance of <unk> where it wants.
The <unk> <unk> <unk> for what we have, even when choice was <unk>.
And more of them are the <unk> that we have <unk>, more <unk> the <unk> <unk> us against how to <unk>.
Here's another example.
This <unk> tells us a lot of things.
It's about to live the moment, and maybe live slowly.
But the most important point is that anything you're going to, you know, you're not going to do other.
The things that don't know many <unk> that can make less <unk> what we do.
<unk> <unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk>.
I tried it on my skin <unk> a new <unk> of <unk>.
It's <unk> <unk>.
Once the <unk> were one of one <unk>, <unk> them and <unk> <unk>, were <unk>, only after <unk> <unk> a life <unk> and <unk> a lot of times, I started going well.
So, I went to <unk> a couple of new when the <unk> <unk> went, and I said, "I need a couple of <unk>, this is my <unk>."
The <unk> said, "You want to <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>?"
You want to <unk> or <unk>?
"<unk> them?"
"<unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk>? <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
I was <unk>, and after a little <unk> to say, "I want the guy to say," I want the <unk> <unk> <unk>, and then I <unk> all <unk> <unk> <unk>, then <unk> me <unk> <unk>, then I had ever <unk>.
It was <unk>. <unk> that <unk> choice had <unk> the best.
But it <unk> me worse.
Why? I've written a whole book for <unk>.
The reason I was worse is that with all that choice my <unk> were <unk>, the <unk> <unk> to be <unk>.
At first, I had <unk> <unk>. I didn't know anything about <unk> when I had one guy. But when I had 100 different <unk>, it had to be perfect.
What I had <unk> was good, but not perfect.
After I <unk> that we <unk> with what I was <unk> in <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> of <unk> in the lives of people who are not <unk> the <unk> that these <unk> <unk> than the <unk> of the <unk> themselves.
And this <unk> <unk>, even when the results are good.
<unk> in the world of <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Because if I <unk> it, I don't know what I'm talking about.
The truth truth is more to this.
"And he was better when he was worse." The reason he was <unk> when he was worse, when he was <unk> even possible to <unk> <unk>.
<unk>, in the world that we live -- <unk> citizens with the <unk> of <unk> -- the <unk> that we can <unk> is that things are <unk> to be <unk>.
You've never ever <unk> <unk> because your <unk>, my <unk>, <unk>.
The <unk> of happiness -- that you're here is, "<unk> <unk>" Yes, "you want it."
I mean -- little <unk> moment -- I'm really <unk> and my wife is really <unk>.
I couldn't do better, I didn't have <unk>.
But it's not always a <unk> thing.
<unk>, a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> when there's only that kind of <unk> is that kind of <unk> is that when you're not <unk>, and you say, "Why?"
Who is <unk>? "<unk>," The answer is <unk>.
The world is <unk>. What could do I do?
When you have hundreds of <unk>, and you'll <unk> one <unk>, and you'll tell you who is the <unk>, it's clear that the <unk> you are.
It could do better.
With hundreds of <unk> <unk>, there are no <unk> for <unk>.
So when people make decisions, even if the <unk> is <unk>, they're <unk> and they give them to themselves.
In the last few years, it's <unk> in the <unk> world.
I think a <unk> <unk> -- not the only one, but important -- of this <unk> of <unk> is that people have experience <unk> because <unk> are <unk>.
And when they have to <unk> this situation they think the <unk> is them.
So the end result is that in general is that in general we're better, but we <unk> worse.
Let me tell you.
This is the <unk> <unk>, what we take for for it and is completely <unk>. It's not true.
There's no <unk> that a little bit of choice is better than <unk>, but it doesn't make much better than a little choice.
There's a <unk> value, <unk>. I don't know what it is.
But I'm pretty sure we've been <unk> by a piece of the level in which the choices <unk> our lives.
Now, from a <unk> <unk> -- I almost finished -- from the point of view, <unk> is <unk>.
What it allows all of this choice in <unk> society is the <unk> material.
There are many places in the world, and you'll have a lot of <unk> <unk>, where the problem is not that they have <unk> choice.
The problem is that they have too much of it.
So the <unk> I'm talking about is a <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> society.
And what <unk> does and <unk> is this: <unk> <unk> <unk> to you yesterday about how much of the <unk> and <unk> <unk> to <unk> are <unk>. It's a <unk> of money.
I mean, these choices, <unk> and <unk>, is not that just <unk>.
They're <unk> <unk>.
They're <unk>.
If a few of what in our society <unk> choice was <unk> in those where people are too much <unk>, it would not just be their lives, but our lives to <unk> our <unk>.
This is what <unk> call a <unk> <unk>.
A <unk> of the income is good at all -- not just the poor -- because of this choice in <unk> that we <unk>.
To end: "<unk>, you can become everything you want to be --
<unk>, people of culture, <unk>: What's going to happen? "
"It's <unk> that you can't make anything in a <unk> of glass."
"A <unk>, a <unk> view of the world --
And I <unk> it like this, in the beginning.
But then, <unk>, I realized that that fish knows that that fish knows the long <unk>.
Because the reality of <unk> is that if you <unk> the <unk>, so that "everything is possible," you can't <unk> the freedom.
If you look at the <unk> so that everything would be possible to <unk> the <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Everybody needs a <unk>.
This is almost certainly too <unk>, maybe even for the fish, and certainly for us.
But the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> is a <unk> <unk> and <unk>, <unk>, for <unk>.
Thank you very much.
