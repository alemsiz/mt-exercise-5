Last year, I showed these slides to demonstrate that the artical heat heat heat at at that almost three million years has had the size of the 48 United States continental continental continental of 40 percent.
However, the gravity of the problem because it doesn't show the pace of the ice.
The artical heat heat is, in a sense, the clear heart of the global climate system.
It expands and reverse it and return it into the summer.
The next slide is going to be a quick fast in the last 25 years.
The wheens are red.
As you see, they expand they expand to the Europe
This is the ice in the winter that reports of the summer.
You can see that the so-called five, five years or more, is like the blood here is like the blood here from the body.
In 25 years old, it was like this.
This is a problem because the rescscale around the ground of the artical ocean, where there are enormous amounts of coal coal carbon that reaches of these things that are transformed by the microbial microbes.
To the totality of the atmosphere.
In some deeper in Alaska is already reaching from the water.
The Katey Walter Katey Walter of the University of Alaska slake in a very lower lack.
Video: Wow! Al Gore: She is good. The question is if we're going to be us.
A reason is that this trainer warwarming the Greenland from the north of the Northern from the north.
This is a glacial record.
She had never reached it had never reached levels.
This is the Kangerlussuaq, in the southwest of the Groenland,
If you want to know how the sea level of the search of ice on the ground, here is where the sea.
These currents are increasing rapidly.
On the other part of the planet: Antarctican block of the planet.
The month last month of the scientists have launch that the ice of the ice is in negative, and the Western Antarctartide on some submarine island, is particularly quick on some submarine island, is particularly quickly quickly in the leaver.
This is six feet of the water, like in Groenlland, like Groenlland,
On Himalaya, the third largest block of ice, you see new laghi, and a few years ago they were ice.
40 percent of the world's population remote half of the clear water.
Sulle Ande: This ice is the source of the water source of this city.
The brought is increased.
However, the same thing happens.
In California, the snow on the Sierra Nevada is 40 percent.
Midries are in crisis.
The predictions, as you have, are grave.
The safe growing up in the world leads to a remarkable increase of the fires.
The environmental disasters are increasing a rhythm and unprecedented.
Four times more numbers in the last 30 years than the previous 75.
This is a whole thing.
If you look in the historic context if you can see the consequences.
In the last five years we added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the oceans every day.
You look at the oriental area of the Pacific area from the Americh, in the west, and in both the parts of the subcontinent, where there is an impose of oxygen in the ocean.
The biggest cause of global warming, together by the deforestation, which is 20 percent, is the use of fossil fuels.
The oil is a problem, and the carbon is even worse.
The United States are one of the most emissions, together at China.
And it was proposing a lot of other carbon.
But we're looking at a direction.
These are the projects in the last few years and some of alternative proposites.
Anyway, there is a political lotta in our country.
The carbon industry and have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promoting the carbon clean, which is a oxymore.
That image I would remember something --
Very Natal, in Tennessee, where there was a 3.8 billion gallons of carbon.
You may have seen it on the news
This is the second biggest flows in America.
It happened around Natal.
The natalization of one of the carbon industry was this.
Vide: The coal carbon is a frostage and happy.
It's abundant here in America, and it makes our economy.
Frosty the carbon is always cleaner.
It's a good price, adorable, adorable, and workers maintains.
Al Gore: From here is most of the West Virginia.
The biggest in the mountain of the mountains Massey Coal. This is his administrator.
Don Bland, Don Blankenship: I'll be clear -- Al Gore, Nancy Reid -- they don't know what they're talking about.
Al Gore: So the Alleance for the Clim has launched two campaigns.
This is one of it, one side.
Video: ALer: We see COALergives we see the climate changes like a night in our business.
That is why our priority is to invest a great amount of money in an advertising to make public and confused to make public and confused the carbon.
In fact, carbon is not spore.
We think it's clean -- it has a good profume.
So not push about climate change.
Let me do it.
Video: Ae: At: Cook: You heard a lot of talk a lot about it.
So let's take a around in a structure at the structure at the structure.
Straordinary, cars are a little noise, but this is the ground.
The carbon consumption is between the main causing global warming, but the remarkable technology that you see it changes everything.
Take a look at this is the odierna technology.
Al Gore: Infinally, the alternative alternative alternative to the economic issue and national security.
Video: Compy; America is in crisi; the national security security crisis.
The movie that lines all this -- our dependence: our fossil fuels and oil, the fuel oil.
So, there is a new, car solution for circles.
America: 100 percent of clean energy, in 10 years.
A plan to put America to work, make us safer safe, and helping us to stop the global warming.
Finally, a solution that basts to solve our problems.
You're going to get the more.
Al Gore: This is the last one.
Man: Comment: This is about reducing the America.
One of the fastest ways, at the end dependency dependency that they kill our planet.
Comparsa: The future is here. You know, a new network is here.
Comparent is 2: Novi investment for good jobs.
Anyway, that's the America. It's time to be realist.
Al Gore: A proverbial African proverbial says, "If you want to go fast.
If you want to go far together."
We have to go far fast.
Thank you very much.
Last year at TED I did an introduction on the LHC.
And I promises to go back to how the machine works.
So here I have. And for those that the other time we don't have the LHC is is the biggest scientific experiment -- 27 kilometers.
Her compit is to reach the conditions that were present less than a billionth of the universe -- to 600 million times a second.
This is just the environment.
This is the car under Gineven.
We do these min-Big Bang in the relevel.
This is what I work on. It's called ATLAS -- it's a 44 meters and has a diameteter.
This is an ATLAT image of ATLAS in building so you can see the proportions.
Ten September 10th, we accept the car for the first time.
And this picture was taken by ATLAS.
It was because of immense immensed in control.
This is an image of the first fashion particles that had all the around the LHC, entertainly, with a part of the LHC, and spread particles inside the reach.
In other words, when we had that image the 10th, we knew that image the 10th was a great living.
I don't know if it was this to do more than that, when somebody went to Google and saw on Google and saw that the page was this.
That means that we had a cultural impact beyond scientific impact.
About a week later, there was a problem with the car, we had to have to these movies.
These files bring 13,000 amps when the car works at the massive of power.
Now, the technicians between you will look at the movies and say, "It's not true. It's not true.
And instead they can do it because when they're very fresh films.
So, at least 271 degrees, at least 271 degree temperature to that space between the stars, these files can bring that current.
In one of the junctures in the LHC, there was a defect of factory.
So the movies are going to read read light, and the 13,000 prints suddenly met an electric resistance.
This was the result.
Now, this is even more impressing if you think that these magneti fish over 20 tons and that have moved about 30 centimeters.
They were damaged about 50 magnets.
We needed to get them, what we did.
We repristed them and upside.
Now they are now coming back all of their place.
By the end of brand the end of the LHC will be again.
And then we expect it, and we expect to achieve the right data, and we continue that our adventure to find out what they're in the morning.
Now, of course, in a way, these accidents reaching the debate on the value of science and engineering. It's about science and engineering. It's easy. It's easy.
I think that the fact that it's so difficult to go beyond the limitations of things like LHC.
I'd like to end with the words of an Inglese scientist, Humphrey Davy, the defense of an experiments in his pupill, his pupill, his pupill, his pupill, Michael Faray, he said, "No is so dangerous for progress of the human mind of the human minds as a definitions, that not mysteries in nature, that there are new worlds of our triones, and that there are no new world."
Thank you.
I want to start asking you to rethink how children, as a child, you play in the morning.
While you understand how to achieve them and grab them, take them and move them, you learn how to think and solve them and resolve them and solve relationships.
The space reasoning is deeply connected to the way we understand most of the world around us.
So, as an informatist inspired by our interaction of our interaction with physical objects, with my Patti, and my collaboratator Jeevan Kalanithi, I started ask, "And when we use a computer, instead of having the mouse of the mouse as a computer, you can only make the digital cursles.
and we set up our pleased please?
The question was so interesting that was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer, building Siftable.
In a words, a Siftable is an interactive computer.
In a words, a Siftable is an interactive computer.
You can move with your hand, they can see them, they can see their movement and they have a screen and a wire radio wireless.
But most rate, they're physical objects like the morning.
The Siftable is an example of a new ecosystem to manipulate digital information.
And as they become more physicist, you know about the movement, of others, and as they become more physicist, and as they become more physicist, you know about their movement, and others, of how we die, we can explore new and funny style interaction.
I'm going to start with some simple examples.
This Siftable is configurated to show vide: if you include it in a direction, the video will rotate with the other side.
Those interactive portraits of others.
If you stop, you care about what they're on them.
If they are surround, and they can get a little bit.
If they are surround, and they can get a little bit.
They also have their movement and clining.
We then realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction of the interaction was able to use of the data as if it was a liquid.
In this case, we have three Siftable configured like vernarrow and I can use them to push the color in that middle.
and I can use them for the color of the color in the middle, where you mix.
And if we are too too much about it.
There are also good chance of learning -- like languages, the mathematics and games where people can try and quickly, and see the results of things and see the results of the immediately.
Now I'm --
This is a Fibonaces that I do with an equations.
Here we have a game of words that is in the Scarabeo and Boggle.
Pratically, at every turns, you get a letter on every Siftable, Pratically, at every Table, I got a letter on every Siftable, and while you try to compop some of them on a dictionary.
Then, after about 30 seconds are remissing, and you have a new set of letters and new possibility.
Thank you.
This is what the children came to the Media Lab, I made them and I went to a video.
They have a lot of please.
And one of the interesting things about this kind of application is that you don't have to give you a lot of educations.
You've got to just say, "Compunds," and they know exactly what to do.
Here is other people who try it.
This is our younger head.
It actually just wanted to take it.
They were only morning.
Now, this is an application of an interactive cardon.
We wanted to build a tool for learning. He is Felix.
It can put new characters in the scene, lifting the Siftable their associated.
It can put new characters in the scene, lifting the Siftable their associated.
So, it's getting the sun.
Vide: The sole is surging.
David Merrill: Now he brought a treatment in the scene.
Video: The argument.
Good! Yes!
And so schooling the Siftable and put them close can make the characters --
Video: Bau!
--
Video: How!
DM: This is an open story with open and it can decide him.
DM: This is an open story with open and it can decide him.
Video: Gold, cat.
DM: The last example I have time to show you is a instrument, made of recent recently, to sampling music.
is an instrument, making recently recently, to sample and executing music.
The Siftable here are acting from sounds like low and battery.
Every one of these has four different variations, and you can choose what to use.
You can put these sounds in a sequence that you can get to your pleasure.
And just modify it just by making a sound."
Those are actually you can control over the way and the movie.
You attack it at a particular sound and then including it up.
And then there are the generals like time and volume, that you apply to the whole sequence.
We look at how it works.
DM: DM: We will start putting one base in two Siftable "sequence."
Now I put a bunch line.
DM: DM: Now I add percent of --
DM: DM: And I'm going to put the filter to the bacteria, so I can control the actual effect.
DM: DM: I can speak the whole sequencing the time from one or the other.
DM: DM: And I'm going to address the bottom for more expression.
Video: DM: I can combine the sequence "flouried."
So I don't have to plan it before, but I can improvise, making longer longer or more corn.
And now, finally, I can fix the whole sequenclining on the left Siftable to the Siftable "volume."
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is to build new new interfaces.
And today, I had time to show you one of the results of this performance, and some possibilities that we try to get out of the laboratory.
The concept I want to transition is that it's coming this new generation of objects designed to interact with digital media in our world.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the time to talk with all of you.
I'm a writer.
From books is my profession but it's more than that.
It's also love and my life.
And I don't expect to change.
But, said that something particularly happened in my life and my career, who brought me back to the whole relationship with this work.
The particular thing is, I recently recently wrote this book, this biography called "The Mangia, Prega, Prega, Amax," the which, differently, from my previous books, for some reason that it used in the world and became a great conversational.
And the result of that is that wherever you go right now, people as if I was conviction.
It is true -- convicata!
They are now concerned to me and they say, "You can't afraid to be able to do better.
You've got no afraid to write for the whole life without more to be able to create a book that can take somebody?"
that can match somebody?"
It's rassicuring, you know.
But it could go worse than 20 years ago, when I started to say that over 20 years ago, when I started to tell people -- I was an adolescent -- I wanted to be a writing.
Againing the same reaction of the fear.
And people would say, "Don't be able to succeed?
You don't afraid that the hummiliation kill?
Do you afraid to do this mestock all the life without anything that is ever outside and die on a cumulation of same, with your mestimate with the mouth of loving cenergy.
So, you know that.
The answer -- the short response to all these questions is, "I."
I afraid of all those things.
I always had fear.
And I am afraid of a lot of other things that people can't guy.
Like, and other frightening things.
But, as much about the writing what I thought and I would ask me, is why?
Is it rational?
It is logic that anyone must wait to be frightened by a job that you feel born to do.
But what are there so particularly creative to make us nervous to make us nervous health.
As my father, for instance, he was a chemist and I don't remember one time in his 40s of activities where he was asked if he was afraid to be engineer to be engineer capit?
There was no -- that block of engineer John, how is you?
It didn't work.
Onestly, chemistry engineers like a bunch of clearly, in the centuries, making the reputation of being alcolized.
We were writings, we have enough this reputation, and not only writers but creatives of any generally, we have this reputation of being enormously instable,
And it's not going to look at the content of the deaths of the magnifies of the magnifies that only in the 2th century, they die young people and often for them.
And the ones that are not suicide seem to be actually disded by their womens.
Norman Mailer Mailer, before I die in the last interview said, "Of my book killed me a little bit more about the work of their life.
But we don't drink when we hear it because we heard why we have these things that so long as we were completely interiorized and accepted the notion of creativity and suffering.
And the question I want to lead to everybody.
You've got this thing -- because you look at a distance from a distance of distance at all.
I think it's odious.
And I think it's also dangerous and I don't want to see perpetuate in the next century.
I think it's better to encourage our great minds.
And certainly I know that in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to begin to fire that the dark of supposedly supposed to the circumstances that I'm in my career.
I mean, it's pretty younger, I'm pretty young, I have about 40 years.
I still have about four decades of work in me.
And it's very likely that whatever I write about now then it will be judged by the world as the work that came after the last book.
I'm going to around, because we're all more or less friends here -- it's likely to my shoulder.
Oh, Gesus who think!
You know, this is the kind of thought that leads a person to start bing channels in the morning and I don't want to do it.
I would keep doing this work that we do.
So, the question become?
And so I think, after many reflection that the way of work to continue write is to create a psychological construct, right?
I must somehow to find a security of safety between me, that I'm writing and my natural anxiety on which reaction that will be able models on how to do I start looking through time, trying to find other societies to see if they could have the best models if they could have better ideas.
how to help people create creative people.
And that research brought me to the ancient Great and ancient Rome.
And then you go back to a circle and then go back.
In the ancient Grece and ancient Rome -- people didn't seem to believe that creativitvity -- people didn't seem to human, OK?
It was thought that the creativity was this spirit of divine and who came to the men from some distant and unknown unknown and unknown and unknown and unknows.
The Greeks called these spirits dians of the creativity of "demony."
Socrative, wonderful, he believed to have a demon wisdom,
The Romans were the same idea, but they called that kind of spirit without a genius.
Which is great, because Romans didn't think that a genius would be a particularly smart.
They believed that a genius was this kind of divine that he believed in the walls of an artist, a little like the Dobby, and who came out of the artist, a little bit like the elfer Dobby, and who came out of that work.
Exception -- that is the distance of that I talk -- that construct psychologists that protects you from the results of your work.
And everyone knew that it was so that it was how it worked, right?
So the ancient artists were protts from certain things, like for example the too narcissm -- you know?
If your work was an exceptional, you couldn't get all over the way, everyone knew that it was helped by this incorporeo.
If your work fail, it wasn't all all of your job, right?
Everybody knew that it was your genius to be an inable.
And so people have,
And then the Renaisses, and all of this great idea; we put the human being at the center of the universe over all of the and mysteries without more to leave space creatures that write details in divinity.
This was the principle of the human rational and people started to think that creativity from the idivid:
And for the first time in history, he started to referred to this or that artist like a rather than a person with a genius.
And I have to tell you, I think it was a big error.
I think to allow someone to believe somebody, a simple person to believe that being a recipient as the source and the source of all the mysteries of all the mysterious mysteries is a responsibility responsibility.
It's like to ask someone to ingodie the sun.
Deform and distores completely the ego and create all these ingestiable ingestyle waiting for performance.
And I think it was this pressure I destroyed artists in the past 500 years.
And if this is true, and I think it is, the question become, and there?
Can we do it different?
Maybe go back to a much more ancient understanding of the relationship between human and creative mystery.
Or maybe no.
Maybe we can't get 500 years of rational thinking in an 18 minutes.
And you probably have people in the audience that it would be able to pushed scientific suspects on the notion of the notion of the notions of their projects.
I probably won't convince you all on this thing.
But the question I want to ask is -- why right?
Why don't you think about this way?
Because it has more sense of anything that I've ever heard to explain the exasperants of the creative process.
A process that, as anyone who I've ever tried to do something -- so basically, all here -- yeah, not rationally.
And in fact, it can sometimes be completely paranormal.
I did this recently encounter Ruth Stone that Ruth Stone, who has now 90 years, but that was a poet-year-old, and he said that during his childhood in the rural Virginia, he was working out in the room, and I felt it in the fields, when a poem came out of landscape.
He said it was like an air.
And it was rounding to her from the landscape.
He was going to get it there, because he was doing the land under his feet.
He had one thing to have one thing to do to that point, and it was -- "currenter words like a morn."
And so it was going to the house and it was followed by this poem, and it wouldn't have to take a piece of paper and a match fair, while the trading, as the translate and grab it on the page.
Sometimes he couldn't be fast enough, so correct and runs without having to get to the house and the poem without getting to the house and the poem was going to continue to roll through the landscape and she would continue to roll through the landscape, as he said, "another poet."
Then there were these times -- this piece I never will not forget -- there were moments where it was almost lost.
So, he was running at home and she was trying to card and the poem went across and she was in the while she was passing, and then he was going on, and then he said that it was like when he was passing with the other hands and the accident.
He went from the tail from the tail, and he would reach it in his body and turned it on the page.
And in these cases, the poem would be in the perfect page and intacts but the contrary, from the last word at the last word at the last word of the first word at the first word at the first word at the last word --
So when I felt it -- it's crazy, it's exactly the huge.
Not all my creative process -- I'm not a conducture!
I'm a tickle, and my way of working is; you wake up at the same time every day and get us to work and go over the enjoying.
But even yet, in my head, I knee, I strowed against that thing, at the time.
And I imagine that a lot of you have been done.
You know, even if the work and ideas came from a certain source I couldn't honestly know.
And what is this thing?
And how can we relate to us to do not lose your head, but stop, pluttoast, what do you do that?
For me, the best contemporary example that I have is the most contemporary musicia Tom Waits, which I interviewed different interview.
We were talking about this, and you know, Tom, for the majority of life was the incarnation of the artist in contemporary art, trying to control these species of creatives of totally interiorized.
But then I get up there, and a day while she was driving on on one day in Los Angeles, changed all for him.
He was going fast, and all of a very little bit of this melodia, which comes into his head as it does the inspiration, elusively elusively and heat, you know, it's wonderful, and the wishes, but it doesn't know how to take it.
It doesn't have a piece of card doesn't have a mark, it doesn't have a recorder.
So it starts to hear this sort of old anxiety to him up, "I'm going to lose and remained obsessed with this song.
I'm not good enough and I can't do it."
And instead of going to the pania, he stop.
I'm going to do the whole process and did something completely new.
He just looked at the sky and said, "Hey, don't see what I'm driving?"
"Do you seem to write a song now?
If you really want to exist, back in a more opposing when I can take care of you.
Otherwise, you go to care anything.
You go to disturbing Leonard Cohen."
And his working process changed after that.
Not the job, the work was even dark as a seed:
But the process, and the heavy that was released when the genius was released when the genius, the genius, the genius, the genius that they would not have to be an internal thing that had to be an internal thing that had to be an interiorate and tormented.
But yes this peculiar, wonderful, wonderful bizarre collaboration between Tom and this strange thing that was not Tom.
So how much I felt that history started to change a little bit the way I work and already saved me a time.
This idea, I save me when I was writing "Mangia, Prega, Amaa," and I falls in one of the disperation where we're working on something and we don't start to think it's going to be a disaster, which is going to be a disaster, that what will be the worst book never never writing.
Not just bad at the worst book writing.
And I started thinking about the project.
But then I remembered Tom who was talking about the air and trial.
So I stood up my face on the hand, and I would say my comments at a vacuum.
And I said, "Look, "Look, what if this book will not be brilliant will not be brilliant, right?
Because as you see what I have, I don't have any more than that.
So if you want to be better, you have to introduce and do your side.
Okay. But if you don't do you know it, you know, I don't do anything.
I'm going to go to write the same because it's my work.
And I would like for favor that was recorded that I was now to do my parte." Because -- at the end is like this, you can -- centuries in the Northern Africa in the Northertherthern Africa in the Northerthern Africa.
And they were always magnificent because the dance were professionals, and they were fantastic.
But, rary, rarally, something happens, and one of these artists became actually transendent.
And I know what I'm talking about, because I know that you've seen it everybody, at some point, a performance.
It was like the time stops and the dance walk through a kind of portal, and it wasn't doing nothing differently, like 11,000 nights before, but everything comes up.
And suddenly not just like a human.
But it turned into the divinity of the divinity of divinity.
And when this happens, you know, at the time, people knew what he was, they called him with his name.
They used your hands and started singing, "Allah, Allah, Allah, God God, God, God God, God, God, God."
That's God, you know.
Curious note -- when the Mors invader the southern of the Spain, they had this abitude with them and footage changed in the centuries from "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Alla
In Spain, when an artist has made something impossible and magic "Allah, Look, Allah, magnifia, you know, this is an argument -- a past of God.
And it's great because we need.
But, the problem comes the next day later, for the dance, when you wake up and discovers that are the 9/11 o'clock in the morning of God is not anymore.
It's simply a mortal death, and perhaps it will never be able to be more to that height.
And perhaps nobody will be the name of God still while ying, and what has to do with the rest of his life?
It's difficult.
This is one of the most painful reconciliations.
But perhaps not have to be so angoshing if you can not believe, in fact, the most extraordinary aspects of your being come from yourself.
But it just believes that there are giving you an inimaginable of this squisite of your life that you have to go to someone else when you go.
And, you know, if we think in this whole way.
And so I started thinking about it, and it's certainly as I thought about it for several months during the work of the book, the dangerous, the dangerous, the dangerous of my success.
And what I have to keep telling me when I feel electried by this is, not fear.
Let me just just your work.
Keep presents for your side, whatever it can be.
If your work is dance.
If the divine, I assigned you assigned you decide to leave it some kind of wonder, for one time through your strength, then "Y!"
Otherment, you do the same dance.
And "Yes!" to yourself.
I think I should teach it.
"Yes!" to yourself, even for the human had and tests and text talks to give you all the time.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: O!
As you know I've been talking about some of these projects on the human genome, about what can mean, and the discovery of new genes.
Now we're starting a new performance, we started digitalizing biology and now starting from that digital code, we're coming into a new phase of biology, designing and synthesizing life.
We always tried to make big questions.
"What is life?" is something that a lot of biologists I've been trying to figure out how different levels.
We tried a different approach, reducing the minimes of terms.
We are digitalizing for about 20 years right now.
When we sequenced the human genome had been treated to go from the world of biology in the digital world.
Now we ask our: can we regenerate life, or create new life from this universe from this digital universe.
This is the map of a small organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, which is the species from genome between those that can authorate into the laboratory.
And we tried to reduce the genome to make one even smaller.
We are able to eliminate a hundred genes of about 500 that are here.
But when we look at the metabolic map to his metabolic map.
You know, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate is, one at the time, it's very unlikely to a living cell.
So we decided that the only way to progression was to synthesize this chromosome, so we could modify the component to some of these fundamental questions.
And so we started the adventure of the "Can we can synthesize a chrow?"
Can the chemistry to make these great molecules that we haven't been able to create before you?
And, in fact, can we make a chromosounding?
A chromosome is just a piece of chemistry.
The speeds that we are able to digitalize life is growing in exponential.
Our capacity to write the genetic code, aging the genetic code ages, but it's better.
And our most recent results carrying on an exponential curve.
We started over 15 years ago.
And the process has required a lot of the past of bioetic revision before we started the first experiments.
But we found out that synthetizing DNA is very hard.
There are tens of thousands of cars in the world that producing small segments of DNA, the long 30 to 50 letters, and it's a degenerative proces: the segment is longer than we are.
So we had to develop a new method to assembling these fragments and correct the mistakes.
And this was our first attempt to go from Phi from Phi 174.
It's a little virus that kills bacteria.
We designed the fragments, effectively the report of errors and got a molecules of DNA of about 5,000 letters.
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemistry of chemistry and we put it in the bacteria have started reading this genetic code and producing the virals.
The viral particles have been released by cells, they come back and have destroyed Es.
I talked about recent with a members of the oil industry said that they have certainly understood this model.
They have more than you.
We believe that this is a situation where the software can actually build his hardware in a biological system.
But we wanted to do things bigger things.
We wanted to build the entire chromosome of the bacteria.
They're more than 580 thousand letters of genetic code.
So we thought we build it in the size of the viruses of viruses, so that we can change the cassette to understand what the components of a living cell.
The design is crucial and if we start with digital information in a computer, these must be very accurated.
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995, the standard accurate was of a mistake for every 10 miles
We discovery resequencing, 30 errors. If we had that original sequence we wouldn't be able to do it.
One part of the process is designing over the 50 letters that they overwhelmed with all the other segments of 50 letters to build smaller underunits that work together.
We provide unique elements here.
You've probably read you that we flights that we flight.
Think of this -- we have a genetic code based on four letters: A, C, Gs and T.
Three of those letters together about 20 amminoids, and there is a specific order of reading for every love of reading for every amminods.
So we can use the genetic code to write words, thoughts.
What we did at the beginning was authography.
Some of them were dolphins from the fact that it wasn't poetry.
We designed these segments to put them together.
There are enzymes that are and put them together.
And we started assembling the parts, starting with segment segments from five to seven miles letter to 24 miles letter from 24 miles at their time to get to 72 letters.
We spend in every step we made these chunks in the abundance that we are trying to create an extremely robute -- how you're trying to create an extremely robute -- as you will see in a minute.
We're trying to automatize the process.
So, this looks like the tabellon a basket.
When we come to these very long, over 100 miles, more than the basisis, they're not going to grow in the E.
You get to the limits of the modern tools of molecular biology.
So we looked at other mechannel.
We knew about another mechanism called recombination of homology, that in biology, that in biology are useful to repair the DNA that can joined DNA to joining the channel.
Here's an example.
This organism called Deinococcus radio harans, it can absorb three millions of radiation.
You can see in the ground, like her chromosome, you can see in the ground.
In 12 -- 24 hours comes assembled exactly how it was before.
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do it.
These organisms can be completely.
They can live in a vacuum.
They're absolutely certainly that life exists in space, and you turn to find new rich environments.
In fact, NASA showed that this happened.
This is an image of the molecules that we built using these processes -- just using this procession with the design of chunk sites.
The lead them assemble automatically.
This picture was not taken with an electron microscope with an electronic microscope.
It's a great molecules that we can see with a slightly microscope.
These are pictures that cover a period of about six seconds.
This is the publication that we had a little time ago.
They're over 580,000 letters of genetic code.
It's the biggest molecule of a defined structure.
It's got a molecular molecular weight.
If we spent it with a carrot 10 without spaces, they would take 142 pages just to turn this genetic code to turn this genetic code.
Now, how do we work.
Of course, you get a virus.
It's a little bit more complicated when you use bacteria.
It's simpler even when it's eukariot cells like ours, you can just extract the nucleo, and you can just extract each other, which is basically the clon.
In the bacteria archaea is integrated inside the cell, but we have recently demonstrated that we can do a complete transplant train of a cell of a cell of another and active.
We purified a party chrowing from a microbial species.
The two are different as men from the topis.
We added a few genes more in a way that we can decide what to choose.
And then I shoot with enzymes in a way to kill all the proteins.
And when we put it in the cell was astonishing -- and you will open our graphy sophisticate -- the new chroads -- the new chroads went inside the cell.
And we started thinking that we were not going to go over there, but we tried to get more in there.
This is one of the greatest mechanism of evolution.
We found that many species have added a second or a third chroads somewhere, I add in a second thousands of new tracks to that species.
So people who think about evolution, like one gene to evolution, it didn't understand much of the biology.
There are enzymes called the restriping enzyme enzyme enzyme as well.
The chromosome that was in the cell doesn't have one.
The cell -- the cell cell that we have inserited --
It was expressed, and he recognized the other chromosome, and we found it -- and we were found with just the cellula and the new chromo.
It became blue because of the genes that we've been inserved.
And in a short of time, all the characteristics of one species are going for, and you moved all in a new species, based on the new software that we put in the cell.
All the proteins have changed, membranes have changed, and when we read the genetic code in exactly what we spent you.
Now, this may look like genetic alchemics, but altering the software DNA we can change things that we can change things.
Now, I explained that there isn't talking about genesis -- but of progress from three million and a half of evolution, and I said that maybe we're going to create a new version of Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosion.
Why do I do that?
I think it's obvious when we think about our needs.
We're going to spend six and a half billion people in the next 40 years.
Just to give an example: I was born in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for each existing in 1946; 40 years, there will be four.
We're having troubling food, fresh, fresh and drink for six and a half billion.
It's going to be even harder to do it for nine billion.
We use more five billion of carbon than 30 billion carbon barrels.
That means a hundred million barrels a day.
When we try to find biological processes or any kind of process to replace them, it's going to be an enormous challenge.
We have to hold all of the CO2 emission of these materials that end up in the atmosphere.
On today today because of the scientific discoveries around the world, we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I like to think that they are designed for the future.
The electronic industry has only one dozen about components, and think about how many different things have come out there.
Our limits here are principles by the reality and our imagination.
Now we have some techniques that thank you these synthetization methods to create what we call combinated.
We are able to build a big robot that can produce a million chromosomes per day.
Think of processing these 20 millions of genes and try to optimize the processes to produce eight or pharmacs, new vaccines, we can change, thanks to a little team, and create more molecular biology now that over the last 20 years of science.
And it's just a standard.
We can choose for chance to survive, producing chemistry or carbon vaccines.
This is an instant of some software programs that we're working on to be able to sit and design species at the computer.
Well, we don't necessarily know how they will be.
We know exactly what their genetic code.
Now we're focusing on quarter generation.
You've seen ethanol from the free was an experiment.
We have charged depending on the third generation that they will be pretty soon from the higher than as the optan or different types of throw or different types.
But the only way biology can have a great impact without increasing increasingly the cost of the food and limiting the availbility would be transformed by designing cells that we're working for designing cells that we're working on for designing cells that we can achieve this purpose, and we are able to design cells in about 18 months.
The sunlight combined with the CO2 is a method -- but in our discoveries around the world, we found different methods.
This is an organism that we described in 1996.
It lives in the deep, about 2,500 feet of deep water.
It creates from the CO2 using hydrogen molecular hydrogen out of energy.
We're trying to figure out if we can meet CO2, which can easily be transported by tubes, converting that CO2 in order to drive this process.
So short we think that we might be able to increase what the basic question of what the basic question what the basic question is Noi, truly -- we have the goal of replacing the whole industry.
Exactly. If you can't do it from TED, where you can?
It would become a main source of energy.
In addition, we're working to use the same methods to create instant vaccines.
You've seen this year with the influence, we're always behind a year and a dollar at least when it comes to find the right vaccine.
I think what you can change with combined combinable vaccines in antical.
This is how the future may start to be changing, now, the evolution, accelerating evolution, accelerating evolution with synthetic bacteria.
We are so so much from improving people.
Our purpose is to make a long time to try and make enough longer to try to do it. Thank you very much.
First of all I'm going to see the most rapidly possible, some fundamental job, the new technology that we brought Microsoft in a nearly year achievement. This is Seadragon.
This is an environment where you can interact with is a local level that remote with an enormous amount of data.
Here we're seeing a lot of gigabyty of digital pictures with a kind of zoom and continue, for a very speeds of panoramic pictures as we want.
And it doesn't matter how big the amount of information that we see, how big the amount of information that we see, how big these data or images.
Most of them are digital photographs, but this for example is a scanning from the Library of Congress and rewalk into the legal of Congress, and it back into the range of 300 megapixels.
It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that the prestations of a system like this is the number of pixels on your screen. It's also a very flexible architecture. It's also a very flexible architecture.
This is an inter, an example of data.
This is Dickens, Dickens. Every coonna represents a chap.
To share to show you that it's not a picture; we can do something like this, to see really that this is a representation of the test, not a picture.
It could be a little artificial way to read an electronic book.
I don't recommend it.
This is a more realistic example of the Guardian.
Every great image is the beginning of a section.
And it really gives you the pleasure and beauty experience of reading the heart version of a magazine or a review of a magazine.
We also did something with the angle of this number in the Guardian.
We have created a high-resolution advertising -- much higher than you use in a normal normal publicity -- and we put you in a normal content.
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile, you can see here.
Or other models, or even specific specifics.
And this really demonstrates some of these ideas to get the limits of space on the screen.
We hope that that this lady to put the pop-up to the pop-up pop-up, not to be necessary.
Of course, the map is one of the obvious applications for this kind of technology.
And I don't want to lose time, if not to say that we have contributes to also in this field.
These are all the roads in the United States, over an image of the NASA.
So now we move to something else.
This is actually right now on the webs; you can go and see it.
This is a project called Photosynth, which fighting two different technologies.
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual computer research from Noah Snavely, a student from Washington, with Steve Steve Seitz of the Washington, with the help of Steve Steve Microsoft Research of Microsoft Research. A very good collaboration.
And it's living on the web, in Seadragon.
You can see it when we do this type of screen that we can move from one on to the other and have this kind of experience of multiply.
But the spacecraft of the images here actually has a meaning.
The actual algorithms of computers have recorded these pictures together, so that they correspond to the real places, so that they correspond to the Lahi Grassi on Mountains on Mountains on Montagne Roccious Montagne R&amp;A slide-stable slide-stable als.
I don't know if I have time to show you some other environment.
There are a lot more space.
I want to go directly to one of the Noah's original data -- and this is from a previous prototype of Photosynth that we did for the first time last summer.
We had to worry about the legal aspects and so forth.
This is a reconstruction of Notre Dame images from Flickr. Basta digital Notre Dame in Flickr. Bastern in Flickr and you get pictures of the types in making. Each one of these arances around. Each one of these arances around.
So they are all taken from Flickr and were all related to this way.
And it's possible to navigate in this simple.
You know, I never would end working for Microsoft.
It's very free to receive this kind of crazy here.
I think you can see that this is a lot of different types of photocation: from those of cellular cellular phones, SLR, a number of meaning in this environment.
And if I can, I'm going to try to find those older.
There are a lot of blocks, etc.
Something here is a series of photographs -- execcold.
This is a poster of Notber Dame record.
We can spend from physical view of this environment.
The essential point is that we can do things with the social environment. This now is taking data from everyday -- from collective whole -- from collective whole of how it looks like the Earth, from a visual view -- and all of that data together.
All of those pictures become related together, greater than the parts.
You've got a model of the entire emerge.
Think of this as Stephen Lawler of Stephen Lawler on Earth.
It's something that grows in complexity as the people are using it, and which advantages for those who uses the use.
Their pictures are brought with metaminserited by other people.
If you have the idea to deliver all of these things are saying, my picture of the Notre of Notther Dame suddenly claims of all those dates, and I can use it as a dot point of all of those data, and I can use the pictures of everyone else, and having a social experience of one of them, and having a social experience, and having a social experience, and having a social experience of the type of red typ-red experience.
Of course, a consequence of all these are models of all the interesting models of all the interesting part of the earth of the Earth, collective only views and satellite pictures and satellite images.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Did you know what? What your software will have to do is that at some point, in the next few years, all of the pictures he shared pictures that everyone in the world will be practically connected together?
BAA: Yeah. What is doing in practice.
It's creating hyperlink, if you want, between pictures.
And it's doing it in the content of the images.
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about wealthy of all of these pictures that many of these images.
Like when you do a research of pictures on the Web and the text on the page Web has a lot of information about pictures of the picture.
Now, what happens if that picture?
So the amount of semant interconnection and the amount of wealthy and the amount of wealthy is really enormous. It's a classical classical effect.
CA: Blaise, it's really amazing.
AA: Thank you very much.
And one of the pleasant pleasure when you travel and one of the innographic research is that we can live between who don't forgotten the old traditions, in the wind, the passed into the wind, the stone in the wine, the stones from the rainjunk today, the leaks in the waves of plants.
Well, you think that shake Jaguar by traveling aguary, or that the myths of the eldery, or Inuit is a meaning of meaning, or that in Himalayaya, the budgy of the Dharm, to remember, to remember, to remember, to remember, the idea that the world in which the world in which the world in which we are not in a sense, but it's just an model.
the following of a particular set choices adaptative that our stype has done, many generations.
And of course, we all share of essential.
We all hidden it.
We are subjects.
We have to deal with the inesority of death, so we don't surprise and balance --
We all have an art.
What you hit is particularly rhythm of every culture.
It doesn't matter that they are the Penan forests or the Borneo, or the Haiti, or Haiti, or Haiti, the desert the Kaid in secentriers in Sepentries of the Curanders' Curandery of the Saa.
He was my journey of journey in the desert a month.
All of these people teach us that there are other ways of thinking about existing other ways to move in the world.
And if you reflect a moment, it's a concept that it can give you.
Inside, the cultures of the world are creating a spiritual spiritual and the cultural cultural life.
And you can think about this culture as an eat, as an ethnoxfhere and you can define the ethnoxy of all the concepts, dreams, idea, ideas, inspirations, ideas, inspirations, ideas, inspirations, ideas, inspirations, ideas, inspirationally from the human imagination of the awareness.
Eetnosm is the fantastic potential of humanity.
It's the symbol of what we are and what we can be in as a kind of quisitive.
And because biosphere has been gravely consumed as much as the ethnox, and unfortunate too much faster.
No biologist, for example, it would say that 50 percent of all the species has been or on the east of the east, just because it's a false or -- in the ipocalittic field -- in the field of biological diversity, and it doesn't get close to a little optimistic -- that of cultural diversity -- that cultural diversity of cultural diversity.
The indicates of that is, of course, loss language.
When you're born 6,000 languages on this planet.
A language is not only composed from a vocabulary or from a series of grammatical.
A language is the sprap of the human spirit.
It's the middle with which the soul of every culture.
Every language is a rainforest, a spiritual forest ecosystem, an ecosystem.
And of those 6,000 languages, while we're sitting in Monterey, at least half is not more surrying in the ears of children.
There are no longer teacher, which, which means to say, unless you change something, that they are already died.
What's more sad of the most sad from the silent of being the last to speak a language, of not getting the wisdom of address or to anticipate the promise of children?
And this horrying was in some part of the world every two weeks of the world every two weeks a lessentially lessly died in the bottom, the last few weeks of ancient language.
And I know anyone to tell you "Isn't that better?
The world would not be a better place if we were all the same language?
We talk about kogis.
You're going to be able to be able to talk about your language.
I would like to do a journey through the etnosfera,
a little journey in the ethnosphery of what we're lost.
Most of us forget that when I say "different different ways of existing existing very different ways.
We take for example this Barasan Barasana, in Amazony Amazony, the population of anaconda, that creates from the edges of the lawyer in the eastern sacries.
This is a popular that it's not able to distinguishing the blue color, because the celests is identified in the forest time of the forest, which depends the people.
They have a strange language and a marriage rule and a married, he said, "exogamics about a different language.
All this has roots in the mitological past, yet the particular is that in these extent families where they talk about six or seven languages in languages.
They are limiting listening and then they start talking about.
We take one of the most interesting tribes that I lived -- the Waorans of the Ecuador nordal, an incredible popular who had the first contacts in 1958.
In 1957 missionarized an attempt to committing,
They made them out of the photograph that they would think that they were in a local friends, forget that this population of the rainforest, had never seen anything about biz-dimensional.
They picked pictures from the ground, they were looking at a form or a shape or a shape, not finding clouds, they would, and they have diavola, and they killed five missionaries with les.
But the Waorans didn't have to kill foreign.
They are killed between them.
54 percent of the death.
We're going to eight generations and we found two of natural death, and we found two of natural deaths and when we were insisted by them to know that one of them were so that he died -- and then they killed himself.
The hunters were able to recognize the animal urine from 40 steps and recognize the species.
In the first '80s, I was assigned a really interesting task when my Harvard professor of Harvard who asked me if I wanted to Haiti in Haiti to intruly society, Duvaler and Tonton Macoutes, and Tonton Macoes, and Tonton Macoes, and implemented Tonton Macoites;
To make a sense that I had to understand the Voodoo culture and that the Voodoo culture and that the Voodoo isn't nera.
It's kind of a metaphor complex.
Very interesting.
If I ask you to tell me the great religion of the world, what would I would say?
Christian: Islam, Ebraism, Ebraism, etc.
A continent is always leaved out, thinking that sub-Saharan Africa has no religies. And instead of it has no religies. And instead of the Voodoo is that the distilled of these very profound religious concepts.
What makes you interesting your voodor is the intense of life and death.
So you have the spirits.
The spirits can be invocated by the Grande Aqua, they respond to the dance of the dance and they replaced temporary soup that for a short active deal.
For this vodoodooists, they love to say, "You're white you go to talk about God.
We give it in the temple, and we become God."
And from the moment that you are possing, is the spirit that drives you, how can you do that?
So you look at this incredible event events. I follow voodoo in the truck of the trance that touch are infueled demonstration of the body when it was catalyzed in an extremely extended in a very excitement of the body when it was catalyzed in an extremely extreme as a remarkable event.
I lived the most extraordinary that I lived the most extraordinary of the Sierra Nevada Santa Mark Colombia.
Instead of the ancient civilization that once once they were living on the Colombic plans of the Colombias in the conquist, the population is going to be a vulcanic massive that you were on charbe.
In a drug continent of blood -- this popular has never been conquised by the spagnowling.
Agains today from a claim but their education is definitely extraordinary.
The young people following away from the families to three or four years, and live in a secreated world of good and shadows in the world of good and shake up at 18 years.
Two period of nine years choices to reproduce the nine months of managation that spend in the user of the mother, are now metaphorically in the user of the user of Madre.
All this time, they are accultured to the values of their company, values that they predate and only their prayers and only their prayers maintaining the cosmic balance.
At the end of this incredible initiation, they suddenly brought out and for the first time in the age of 18 years, they see an alba. And in that activity of the first bunch of the first bunch of the beautiful landscapes, all that they learned in theory, all of that they learned in theory, all of his splendor. The prey does a step back behind it and says,
"Right? Right how I detail.
It's amazing. Now it's going to protect it."
It's called the greatest brothers and say that we, brother brothers are the destruction of the world.
This level of intuition is extremely important.
When we think about India's populations and we invote Rousseau and the old history of the noble history of the noble history of the noble history or perhaps invote Thoreu and say these people are closer to Earth.
The indigenous people.
There is no space for these things in the malaric stage in the gelides of the Tibet, but because of the time and rits, they created a mystic of the Earth not about the concept of being consciously, but on an intuition. The concept that the Earth can live because it's not knowing that the Earth can live because it's only by the human consciousness --
What does that mean?
That means that a young boy of the Ande who grow from the mountain is a spirit of an Apu that will be a foundly differently and will have a very different relationship and will have a very different relationship with the mountain or that place in the mountain of Montana growing mountain is growing that growing a mountain.
Which is the didry of a spirit or a little bit, is irrelevant.
What is interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between individual.
I grew up in the Columbia Britannica believing that the rainforests had to be cut.
And I made me a human being different from my friends Kwakiutl who believe that the rainforests are the Hukukukukukukuk and the spirits of the paradic of paradic and spirits.
If you start to consider that these cultures can actually create different, you can actually start to understand some sense; you can start to understand some sense.
I took this picture to aprile in the nordocky.
Perhaps some of you have heard about the ayahuase, the most powerful repertance of the repertorium.
What makes a fascinating ayahuas's not the potential that is not the potential of the supply of the support -- but his two elements.
From one side, this legiate that has a series of beta-carboline, harmine and hard-carbolinogens.
Pring the only plant plant, you have a bunch that alters a little bit of the consciousness, but it's measured with the leaves of a coffee of coffee of the coffee of coffee.
This plant is powerful powerful powerful trip to serotonin methoxyptamine-5, methoxyptamine-5, methoxyptamined methoxyptamines.
If you ever see the Yanomami, you can see the nose of the substance that make from a different set of species, it has met methoxyptoxydimethoxypt.
Tirdate on the nose is a little bit like being disappeared by a bunch of barockers and land on an electricity.
I was often with my professor, Richard Evan Shultes, Richard Evan was shultes, with his discovery, with his discovery.
Accord can't be classify these triamins like hallucinogeny because if you're made not telling anyone to be hallucinated. But you can't be hallucinated. But they can't be hurt because they are denly denly in the intestination that you find naturally in the intestine-toxidays.
You can be able assumed if you put them with other chemicals that denizing the MAO.
Now this is the beautiful, the carbolins that are in this book, are starting MAO, the same kind of need for potential to potentiate triptamines. The question is spontane: in an 80,000 species of plants, how do these people find two death, but if you find it in this way, they think about a biochemistry, but if you combine in this way, believe a biochemistry that it is superior at at the perior at at the part?
We use the great euphemism of evidence and error, that can revealing infruttly.
But if we ask Indians, they will tell us "The plants.
What does that mean?
This tribe, Cofan Cofan has 17 variety of ayahuas, that distinguished in the forest, and our eyes would come into the same species.
If you ask how they stabilize their pockets will tell us how to tell us how much plants, of the rest I don't know everything?" I said, "No."
The solution is, you take the 17 variety in a night of a full and each one will be with a different tone.
With this not graduate to Harvard, but it's much more interesting than counting stams.
Now, the problem is that even those of us who also have the people who have to heart the people who have indigenous heart and reduced them with the margins of the history of our real world of history than our real world of history.
In fact, the 20th century, 300 years, it's not going to be remembered for his wars or its technology, but rather like the age that we were stopped and we embracing the destruction of the planet and we have embracing the destruction of the planet. Now the problem is not change.
All cultures through the centuries have been involved in a dance for new life.
And the problem is not technology.
Indians have no way to stopped being Sioux when they put away from the ark and free free so like Americans don't have to be Americans when they put from the horses and heat.
It's not the change or technology that threatening the integrity of ethnosfera. It's the power.
The domination.
And if you take a look at the world, you will find that these are not destined culture.
These are living and dynamics and dynamics out of the existing forces that go beyond their ability to adaptation.
This is the disboaring in the pathy of Penan:
a population of Sarawak, in the southern Sarasia, a population that has lived in the forests to a generation -- and now reduced to the prostitution, where you can see the rivers of rivers, where you can see the rivers, where you can see the river from Meria, where you can see the river from the Chinese Cinese Meria, where navi navi navian Meria.
ready to fill the stays with the legs with the layer to the forest.
Or in Yanomami, in Yanomami, are the diseases that have come with the discovery.
If we move on the Tibet, where I'm doing a lot of research, where I'm doing a lot of research, you'll see the harvesting of the political domination.
As you know the genocide -- the physical extinction of a population, it's convicted to the universal level, but the destruction of one population, not just conviction of one population, not just convicted -- but celebrated in certain environments, because it makes part of the development.
And you can't understand the Tibet until you go from the beginning.
I spent the 6,000 miles from Chengdu in China in China in China in the Western Tibet in Lhasa young college with a young college, but only arrived Lhasa young colleagues that we hear about it.
6,000 sacred montains in the political money.
1.2 million people killed by military military during the Cultural.
The father of this guy was listen to Panchen Lama.
That means that it's been killed at the time of the Chinese invasion of Chinese invasion.
Your uncle in Santity during the diaspora that has brought the people in Nepal.
Her mother was imprisoned and his guilty was to be rich.
It was brought up in the middle of two birth years on the age of two years nose below his gonna because he couldn't live without him.
The sister, who made the smile of reeduged field.
One day has been wildly calculated a fasolk of the Mao Mao and, for this transgression, has been forced by seven years.
The Tibet can be inhurtable, but the spirit of the population of the population is from keeping present.
At the end, all you reduce a choice.
Could we live in the world of the world of the monotonia or we want to get the policyromatch of diversity?
The great anthropologist Margaret Mead, before we die said his greatest fear of the world was that, in our way to this lovel vision love, we will not only see the legal legal of the human imagination is reduced to an unveil, but a day we wake from a dimention of mind:
And it's humbling our species is existed for 600,000 years.
The Neolitic revolution, who gave us agriculture, that made us sophistical, replacing the poem of the seeds, replacing the poem of the specialization of the specialization of the specialization, and we talk about 10,000 years ago.
The modern industrialized world has 300 years.
The shark of history doesn't suggests that we have the answers to all the challenges that we're going to face in the millennia.
When the cultures of the world are asked about what it means to be human, they respond with 10,000 voices.
And it's in these answers that we all remove the chance of being what we are.
I took this picture of the north island from the Baff, when I went to the whales of the Inuit, and this man, Olayer, and this man, Olayer was telling the wonderful story of his grandfathers.
The Canadian government was not always gentle with the Inuit and in the '50s to our presumption in the 1950s to our sound.
The grandfather of this man refused to go.
The family, tempting for his life, brought all of his arms, and all of its attaches.
You've got to know that the Inuit don't know the coffee.
The slittles in the origin were made of the weight of the skin of the caribs.
The grandfather of this man did not intimit by the night or the basis of the art or bely;
He's sunchly; he hoted the pantalons in their hands.
He pushed on the stage of this caccept and when I became solid, he killed a dog.
He brought the dog and created a brief, with the slady has created a slectured a slectured another dog and has disappeared on the buck of the buck of the glass in it.
We want to talk about horse with now? [Ris] And this, in different ways, [Applausi] is the resilience of the Inuit and all the people in the world.
In the 'aprile 1999, the government canadise has reduced to Inuit the total control of an area of the biggest land of the California and Texas I put together.
It's their new patria. It's called Navut.
It's an independent territory. They shoot all the minerary resources.
A wonderful example of how a nation-state can recognize with his people.
And finally, I think it's quite obvious at least of the people who was in these remote areas of the planet, I realized that not removed.
For someone is home.
They represents of the human imagination sitting at the time.
Finally, National Geographic we are convinced that politicians will never come to anything.
We believe that the pole --
[Applaus] are not persuasive, but we believe that stories can change the world, and perhaps we are the best institution to tell the stories of the world. Every month our website has 35 million visites.
156 countries turn our television our television chanal.
Our magazines are reading from millions of people.
Our work is traveling in the ethnosphere to bring our audience in places that will go away from how they have come frozen as well as they saw it, and hopefully will be, hopefully, and we have to find a central received, and we have to find a style in the diversity, and we need to find one in a plurist and multicultural multicultural world and multicultural multicultural
where the wisdom of all people can contributing to our collective well-being.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope to call other things that you've already heard and I'll try to turn some colleagues.
I want to start with what I call "the official."
The official dog?
The official dogment of all the Western industrial society. The official dog: "If we want to be wealthy of our citizen."
The reason is, from one side, in the fact that freedom is in itself a value of human beings.
On the other one is the fact that if we are free, each one of us can be able to do everything that masses our well-being, without no one that decide in name.
The way to maxize freedom is massizing the choice.
More choices people are free, and greater is their freedom, greater is their freedom, greater is their well-being.
This is, I think, is so profoundly rooted in the society that nobody would have dream to put it in doubt.
And it's also deeply deep in our lives.
I'm going to show you some examples of what progress.
This is my supermarket. It's not particularly great.
I permit a simple note about conditional conditions.
In my supermarket, there are 175 conditions, without counting the 10 variety of extrack and the 12 bunch of oil and the 12 whales that you can buy for a enormous numbers of condition that no one of the 175 reads who already have an enormous numbers.
This is what the supermarket.
Then you go to the electronic stom, to buy a stere: CD, radio, radio, plast, radio, plast, amplificator.
And in this single store, there is a great audio.
We can do six and a half million combination using the components that there are in one story.
You have to admit that there is a lot of choice.
Other field: the world of communications.
One, when I was a child, you could get all of the wished telephone services that were the mom of mamma Bell.
It was known the telephone, I didn't buy it.
A consequence of that, between the other, was that the phone is that the telephone is not stage.
These days are going to be there.
We now have a variety of telephones, especially among cellular phones.
Here are the cellular cellular phones.
My favorite is that in the middle of the nose MP3, cuts of the nose and strine for the brule.
If you weren't seen it yet in the house, you're pretty well going to get there.
And what finally happens is that people enter in the stores and ask this question. And you know what the answer? The answer is "No."
It's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn't do too many things.
So, in other aspects of life that are much more important than the purchases of choices.
There is health is no longer in the United States that you go from the doctor and the doctor, and the doctor what you have to do.
Instead, you go to the doctor, and the doctor says, "OK, we could do A, or B" "In these benefits and they said, "B has these benefits and risk."
You say, "Doctor, what should I do?
And the doctor says, "In these benefits and these answers, and B has these answers and Bs these risk."
"What do you want to do?"
And you say, "Dr. ♫ ♫ Well if she was me, what do you do?"
And the doctor: "But I'm not leed."
The result that we call it "malathonom," expressure that it looks like a beautiful thing.
But it's actually not that one to move the fish and the responsibility of making decisions from somebody who knows somebody's doctor, to someone else who don't know anything -- and almost certainly is sick -- and therefore not in the ideal condition.
There is an enormous marketing of drugs, direct people like me and you, if you think of it doesn't have any sense that we can't buy them.
But if we can't buy them, why are they public?
The answer is that they want to doctor called the doctor to ask ourselves to change the wealth.
Something about so fundamental is our identity is a question of choice, as you see in this way, "We don't want to force the children. We don't want to force.
And we can reinvent how many times we can reinvent.
Which means that every morning, at risk, you have to decide that kind of person wants to be.
And in the family and marriage at the family, a time the perspective almost for anybody, it was that you can married the most soon as possible, and it was going to get the most soon as possible.
The only true choice was with while, not when and they don't even like what to do later.
It's really going to play it.
I teach students very smart, and I do their 20 percent of work than a time.
And not because they are brilliant, not because they are less diless.
But why I'm imthinking, I mean, I mean to ask, "I should I be marries or not? I should do it now?"
Are I late?
These are interrogatis.
And they try to answer these questions, even if this implementementing not completing the tasks that I listen to my exame.
And they have to actually ask it. It's important.
Now, the job: we're lucky, like Carl subolineavy, because technology allows us to work every single single day, from the planet, except from Hotel Randol.
In parents, there is a parents, and I'm not going to tell anyone where, where the WiFi works.
I don't tell you, because I want to use it.
What does this incredible freedom of choice that we have about work? It's that we have to continually decide, continuously right at every time, if we have to work or not.
We can go and see our son play, with the cell phone in one pocket, with the Blackberry on the other, and the notebook, typically on the knee.
And even though they're all spell, every minute that we see our boy rovinar, we also asked, "I have to answer this call?
"I have to answer this email? I have to email?
And even when the answer is "no," all this makes the experience of your son was very different than you would have been in other conditions.
So, whatever we look at all, small things and big, objects, material and stiles of life, life is a question of choices.
Once the world was this: Obo, there were some possibilities, but it wasn't a chance of choice.
The world today looks like this: The dilemma ism is: "Is it positive, or negative thing?"
The answer is Sin:
The positive lights we all know -- so I'm going to talk about the negative.
All this choice has two negative effects two negative effects on people.
The spring, paradoxy, is that producing paralysis.
With many options in which you channel, it becomes very hard to do it.
I give you an significant example of the volunteer of voluntary pensions.
A colleague had access to the giant data from Vanguard, the gigant companies, with about a million clients, with about a million-companies.
What she found is that for every 10 solutions that are offered for every 10 solutions that are offering adepartment.
With 50 sources of offeres, there is 10 percent in less than when they are available, only 5. Why?
Because with 50 sources in which you choose -- it's very hard to decide, and the choice is remainly difficulty to the question.
And I still ask question, and I still wonder, question, and of course, the questions don't get it.
You know that not just means that these old workers are going to be food, because they won't have enough money, they don't want to say that decision is so obstic that also, even the complementary sources of work.
Not participating, they're losing to 5,000 dollars per year from the workers of work, that would be drinkled.
So the paralysis is a consequence of having too many choices.
And I think that makes the world like this.
"And finally, for the eternity."
You'd like to make the right decision, if it's for the eternity, right?
You don't want to choose the wrong, and you don't want the wrong condition
So this is the first effect. The second is that even if we can avoid paralysis and make a choice, at the end of how we would be staying with less options.
And that for different reasons.
One of these is that with a lot of conditional conditions, if you buy one and it's not perfect -- it's easy to imagine that you could make a different choice that would be better. And what happens is that the alternative imagines that it would be better. And what happens is that the alternative soddisphones. And what happens is that it is that you would have to be better than the decision,
even when it was a good decision.
More choices are easier than you have any details of any detail, which is inherent of the choice.
Also, there is what economists call cost-opportunity.
Dan Gilbert has very well stuck as the value as the value that we give to the things that we company.
First, when there are a lot of options possible, is easy to represent the alternative characteristic alternative and being less sophistated with the option that is choice.
Here's an example. I'm going to go with all the people that are not in New York.
But that's what you would probably think about it.
There's this copy to Hamptons.
A place.
Hunt splendid. Oty day. It's all for them.
Not sent anything. But what he thinks is, "Well, sick."
"All of my neighbors in Manhattan are living."
"I could park right in front of home."
And it spends two weeks with the idea that it's losing -- every day -- the chance of parking where you want.
The expensive opportunity defecation for what we have, even when the choice was excellent.
And more are the options that we have to be considered, more the characteristic characteristics are going to come back against opportunity.
Here's another example.
This is a lot of things.
It talks about living the moment, and perhaps of living right now.
But the most important point is that whatever you choice, you know, you don't do others.
The things that we don't choose to attractive what we do.
Third point: the spiral growth of waiting.
I tried it on my skin.
Jeans.
Once jeans were of one typical type, you buy them and clothes, they were besty, only after I brought them a life and work a lot of times, starting to go good.
So, I went to buy a couple of new when the old people were gone, and I said, "I need a couple of jeans, this is my cut."
The comedy said, "You want slim fit, relaxed up, relaxed fit, relaxed?"
Do you want to the cerny or with the bottonies?
"Do you want rot?"
"Would you want to hold or close?
I was stunked, and after a little baby, I would say, "I want the kind of -- that was the only one ty." He had no idea what it was so time I tried to all the maleat, and then I went out from the negoti, and then I came out of the negoti, with the best couple of jeans that I had ever had.
It was the massive. With all that choice I had the bad.
But I felt.
Why? I wrote a book.
The reason I was I was worse is that with all that choice, my expectations, jeans had to be perfected.
At the beginning I had expectations. I didn't expect anything about exception when there was only one of the guy had to be perfect.
What I had the purpose was good, but not perfect.
After I had paragoned to what I tried I was inherent in confronted.
The addition of options in life of people do not to increase the expectations that these are respected with options.
And this will produce less sophistation, even when the results are good.
No one in the world of marketing if it makes it.
Because if I know what I'm talking about.
The truth looks more like this.
"It was better when it was worse when it was better when it was better when it was better when it was worse was that when it was worse we could meet the surprise pleasure.
In the world we live in the world that we live -- opulent industrialized citizens with the expectation of perfeation -- the we can hope is that things are at the height of waiting.
You'll never surprised because your expectation because your expectations, my expectations.
The secret of happiness -- what you're here -- it is, "Baseded" "Yes, you want."
I mean -- little authobiographic moment -- that I'm really married and my wife is truly.
I couldn't do better, I don't have to do better, I am not contented.
But account is not always a bad thing.
Finally, a consequence of buying a couple of jeans when there is only that jeans is that when you're not satisfaction, and you ask you why. Why?
"Who is responsible?" The answer is clear.
The world is responsible. What could I do about that?
When there are hundreds of jeans, and you buy one insoddisfact, and you ask you who is responsible responsible responsible responsible for you're you.
You'd have been able to make better.
With hundreds of variety available, there are no excuse for insuccess.
So when people make decisions, even if the result is valid, they feel inherent and damage to their own itself.
In the last depression is exploded in the industrialized world.
I think a significant factor -- not the unique, but important -- of this depression of depression is that people have deludent experiences because standards are too high.
And when they have to explain this situation they think that the guilty is them.
So the final result is that we are in general we're in general, objectively, but we feel the worse.
Let me tell you.
This is the official dog; what we all take for good and it's completely false.
There is no doubt that a little choice is better than a little choice is better than a little choice is better.
There is critical. I don't know what it is.
But I'm sure we overcome from a piece of a piece of the piece of choices improving our life.
Now, from the political view -- I have almost finished -- from the political point of the political view.
What it allows all this choice in industrial society is the material.
There are a lot of places in the world, and you know what the problem is not that they have too much choice.
The problem is they have too long.
So the factory that I'm talking about is a malachieving of moderns, rich societies.
And what it makes you depress and angry is this: Steve Levitt talked to you about the cost and seats seats are useful. It's a waste of money. It's spread of money.
I mean that these choices, complicated and dispendious, it's not simply usely.
They're even deleteria.
There are worse.
If a little bit of what in our societies allowed a lot of choice was reverted in those where people have too much chance, it would not only life as well.
This is what economists call a paretyan.
A redistribution is good at all -- not only to the poor -- not only to the poor -- because of this choice in excess that torments.
And finally, you can become everything that you want, you can become all that you want,
You know, people of culture, they think, "What do that fish?"
"It's obvious that you can't do anything in a vetrow."
"A imagination castred, a limited vision of the world."
and I stood that I interpreted, at the beginning.
But then, I realized that that fish, I realized that that fish the long.
Because the reality of facts is that if you sent the mouth, so that "everything is possible," you can't get the freedom.
If you throw the mouse in a way that all the you can be able to decrease the satisfation.
You get the paralysi, and you reduce the wealth.
Everybody needs a sphere.
This is almost certainly too strict, perhaps even for the fish and certainly for us.
But the absence of some symbolic symbolics is a recipe for infelicity, temption, for the ruine.
Thank you for heart.
