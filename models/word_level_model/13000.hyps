<unk> year I showed these <unk> to <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk>, which for almost three million years had the size of the United States <unk>, the <unk> of the United States <unk>, <unk> 40 percent.
<unk> this <unk> of the problem because it doesn't show the ice <unk>.
<unk> <unk> is, in a sense, the heart of <unk> of climate change.
It's <unk> and it <unk>.
The next <unk> is going to be a <unk> <unk> on the last 25 years.
<unk> <unk> are <unk> in red.
You see, you see, you go to the blue <unk>.
That's the ice in <unk>, which is <unk> summer.
You can see that the <unk> ice <unk>, of five years, more, it's like the blood here <unk> from the body.
<unk> years, it's been in 25 years, so.
This is a problem because the <unk> is <unk> the <unk> ground around the ocean <unk> where there are huge amount of <unk> <unk> that, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>
<unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk>, that <unk> could <unk>, that amount of <unk>, that <unk> <unk> this point of not <unk>.
In a little <unk> <unk>, the <unk> is already <unk> by water.
The <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> is <unk> with a <unk> team of a <unk> <unk> last <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>! <unk>: She's good. The question is if you look at it.
And that's why this <unk> <unk> <unk> from the north.
This is a river in <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> never <unk> like that.
This is the <unk> river, in the <unk> of <unk>.
If you want to know how the <unk> <unk> <unk> on <unk>, here is where the sea.
These <unk> are <unk>.
<unk> other part of the planet: <unk>, the greatest <unk> of the planet.
<unk> month, scientists have <unk> that the <unk> of ice is in <unk>, and that <unk> <unk> on a few <unk> <unk>, is particularly <unk> in <unk>.
<unk> at six feet of the <unk>, like in <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, the largest <unk> of ice, you see new <unk>, which a few years ago.
<unk> percent of the world's population <unk> half of water <unk> by that <unk>.
<unk> <unk>: this <unk> is the source of the <unk> water of this city.
The <unk> is <unk>.
But when you <unk>, the same happens to the water.
<unk> <unk> <unk> is <unk> 40 percent.
<unk> are in the crisis.
<unk>, like you read, I'm <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> in the world, it's <unk> to a <unk> <unk>.
<unk> are <unk> to a <unk> out of the normal and without <unk>.
<unk> times over the last 30 years of <unk> <unk>.
This is a <unk> of all <unk>.
If you look at it in the context of the <unk> can see the <unk>.
In the last five years we've <unk> 70 million CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million <unk> in the oceans every day.
Look at the area of the <unk> <unk>, <unk>, to <unk>, and <unk>, and on both the parts of the <unk> <unk>, where there is a <unk> <unk> of oxygen in the oceans.
The most of global warming, together to <unk>, which is 20 percent, is the use of <unk> <unk>.
<unk> is a problem, and <unk> is even worse.
The United States is one of the most <unk> countries with China.
And they <unk> to build a lot of other <unk> to <unk>.
But we're <unk> to a <unk> of it.
These are the projects <unk> in the last few years and some <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
And so, there is a <unk> politics in our country.
<unk> and oil <unk> have <unk> million dollars in the last year to <unk> <unk>, which is a <unk>.
I <unk> image, I <unk> something --
<unk> <unk>, where I live, there was a <unk> of <unk> billion <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
Maybe you've seen it on the <unk>.
This is the second largest flow of <unk> in America.
It's success around <unk>.
<unk> of one of the <unk> <unk> was this.
<unk>: <unk> â™« <unk> is a <unk> like a <unk> and happy.
It's <unk> here in America, and it makes our economy.
<unk> is <unk> and more and more <unk>.
It's at good price, <unk> and <unk> <unk> it.
<unk>: <unk> is a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The largest society <unk> on the <unk> is <unk>. This is his <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> <unk>: <unk> -- Al <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> -- they don't know what they're talking about.
<unk>: So <unk> for the <unk> of the <unk> has <unk> two <unk>.
This is one of them, one part.
<unk>: <unk>: At <unk> we see the changes as a <unk> <unk> to our business.
And that our <unk> is <unk> a great amount of money in a <unk> <unk> to make public and <unk> the truth.
<unk> is, <unk> is not <unk>.
We think it's <unk> -- it also <unk> -- it's also a good <unk>.
So we don't know about climate change.
We're going to do.
<unk>: <unk>: <unk> <unk> -- you've heard a lot of it.
So I <unk> a <unk> <unk> for <unk> as <unk> as <unk> <unk>.
<unk>! <unk> are a little <unk>, but this is the sound of the technology of <unk>.
<unk> is <unk> of <unk> is global <unk>, but the <unk> technology of <unk>, but the technology of <unk> that you see everything.
<unk> a look: this is the <unk> technology of <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk> to the economic issue and the <unk> of national security.
<unk>: <unk>: <unk> America is in the crisis; the economy, national <unk>, the <unk> crisis.
The <unk> that <unk> all of them: our <unk> <unk>, like <unk> and <unk> oil.
But, but, there's a new, <unk> solution to <unk>.
<unk> America: 100 percent of energy energy, in 10 years.
A plan to <unk> America to work, <unk>, <unk>, and help us <unk> global warming.
<unk>, a solution that we <unk> to solve our problems.
<unk> America. <unk> more.
<unk>: This is the last.
<unk>: It's <unk>: it's <unk> energy to America.
One of the most <unk> ways of <unk> <unk> to <unk> from the <unk> that <unk> our planet.
<unk>: The future is here. <unk>, <unk>, a <unk> network.
<unk> <unk> 2: <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> America. It's time to be <unk>.
<unk>: A old <unk> <unk> says, "If you want to go to, go to alone.
If you want to go away, you go to. "
We have to go far, very quickly.
Thank you very much.
<unk> year at TED, I did an <unk> on <unk>.
And I'm going to try to <unk> how the machine works.
So I <unk> it. And for those that the other time there were no, the <unk> is the largest scientific experiment ever <unk> -- <unk> miles of <unk>.
His task is to <unk> the conditions that were <unk> less than a <unk> of a <unk> <unk> by the beginning of the universe -- to <unk> million times a second.
That's just <unk>.
This is the <unk> machine.
<unk> these <unk> <unk> into the <unk>.
This is what I'm working. It's called <unk> -- it's <unk> feet and it's a <unk> of <unk>.
This is an <unk> picture of <unk> in building so you can see the <unk>.
<unk> last year we <unk> the machine for the first time.
And this picture was <unk> by <unk>.
It was because of <unk> <unk> in control.
It's an image of the first <unk> of particles that he did everything around the <unk>, <unk> in <unk>, <unk>, with a part of the <unk>, and <unk> particles in the <unk>.
In other words, when you look at that picture the <unk> 10 <unk>, <unk> that the machine, which is a great <unk>.
I don't know if it was this to do <unk> more or this, when somebody <unk> on Google and <unk> that the <unk> was this.
That means we've had a <unk> impact beyond that scientific.
<unk> a week later, there was a problem with the car, we had to just these <unk> here -- these <unk> <unk>.
These <unk> <unk> <unk> when the machine works at the <unk> of <unk>.
Now, the <unk> of you <unk> the <unk> and <unk>, "It's not true. I'm <unk> too much <unk>."
And instead they can do it because when they're very <unk> become the <unk> <unk>.
So, at least <unk> degrees, at a temperature <unk> to that the space of space between stars, these <unk> can bring that <unk> that <unk>.
In one of the <unk> of the most <unk> <unk> in <unk>, there was a <unk> of <unk>.
So the <unk> <unk>, and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk>.
This was the result.
Now, this is even more <unk> if you think that these <unk> <unk> more than 20 <unk>, and that <unk> of about 30 <unk>.
It's about 50 <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, what we did we.
We <unk> them and <unk>.
They're now <unk> all about their <unk>.
<unk> the end of <unk> the <unk> is going to be new <unk>.
We <unk> it, and we <unk> to get <unk> data to <unk> or <unk>, and <unk>, and so our <unk> to find out what the universe are.
Now, of course, in a certain way, these <unk> <unk> the <unk> of science and engineering <unk>. It's easy to <unk>. It's easy to <unk>.
I think the fact that it's so hard, the fact that it's the value of things like <unk>.
I'd like to <unk> with the words of a <unk> <unk>, <unk>, which, <unk>, <unk>, in <unk> of the <unk> experiments of his <unk> was Michael <unk>, he said, "No," <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of human mind as <unk> that ideas of science as <unk> that are <unk>, that there are <unk>, and there are no <unk> in nature, and there are no <unk> by new <unk>.
Thank you.
I want to start <unk> when, children, <unk>, <unk> with <unk>.
<unk> as <unk> and <unk>, <unk> and <unk> and <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> relationships.
The <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> to the way that we <unk> a lot of the world around us.
So, from <unk> <unk> of our <unk> with <unk> objects, together to my <unk> <unk>, and my <unk> <unk>, and my <unk> <unk> <unk>, I started <unk>, "And if we use a computer, instead of having the only <unk> as a digital <unk> that moves on a <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> an information <unk> with <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> an information <unk> with the hands.
and we <unk> to our <unk>?
The question was so interesting that we could explore the answer, building <unk>.
In a few words, a <unk> is a <unk> computer as a <unk>.
In a few words, a <unk> is a <unk> computer as a <unk>.
You can <unk> with your hand, you can <unk> them, and they feel their movement and they have a screen and a <unk>.
But <unk>, they're <unk>, like <unk>, you can <unk> just <unk>.
<unk> are the example of a new <unk> of tools to <unk> the digital information.
And as they become more <unk>, <unk> of their movement, other, and they become more <unk>, <unk> of their movement, of their own movement, others, of how we can explore new and <unk> <unk>.
I'm going to start with some simple example.
This <unk> is <unk> to show video: if you put it in a direction, the video <unk>, so if you go back to a video: the other side <unk> back.
These <unk> <unk> are <unk> of others.
If you <unk> them, you're <unk> to what it's going to be around.
If they're <unk>, you can <unk> it and they can <unk> a little bit.
If they're <unk>, you can <unk> it and they can <unk> a little bit.
They also <unk> their movement and <unk>.
We realize that one of the interesting <unk> of the <unk> was that we could use common on data data, to example, "<unk> a color as if it was a <unk>.
In this case, we have three <unk> <unk> as a <unk> of <unk> and I can <unk> to <unk> of the <unk> in that central.
and I can <unk> to <unk> of the <unk> in the central <unk>, where you're <unk>.
We can <unk> too much, we can <unk> a little bit of place.
I also have to be <unk> <unk>, like <unk>, <unk> and games where people can try and <unk> where people can try and make things quickly, and they <unk> the results immediately.
Now I'm --
This is a sequence of <unk> that I do with a <unk> program.
Here we have a <unk> of words that is in half <unk> and <unk>.
<unk>, at every <unk> <unk> a letter on every <unk>, <unk>, <unk> to every <unk>, <unk> a letter to every <unk>, and as I was <unk> to <unk> words, he <unk> on a <unk>.
Then, after about 30 seconds, you <unk>, and you have a new <unk> of <unk> and new possibilities to try.
Thank you.
Here's <unk> children in <unk> <unk> at <unk> <unk>, I did in the way that I <unk> them and I <unk> a video.
They are very <unk>.
And one of the interesting things of <unk> is that you don't have to <unk> people.
I just say, "<unk> of words," and they know what to do.
Here's other people who <unk> it.
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk>, there's right.
But actually wanted to <unk>.
They were just <unk>, for him.
Now, this is a <unk> of a <unk> <unk>.
<unk> to build a <unk> for the <unk> of the <unk>. He's <unk>.
It can <unk> new characters in the scene, <unk> their <unk>.
It can <unk> new characters in the scene, <unk> their <unk>.
So, it's <unk> out.
<unk>: The sun is <unk>.
David <unk>: Now he took a <unk> in the scene.
<unk>: <unk> <unk>.
<unk>! <unk>!
So <unk> the <unk> and <unk> can <unk> the characters --
<unk>: <unk>!
-- <unk> your story.
<unk>: <unk>!
<unk>: It's a story with the final <unk>, and it can decide he <unk>.
<unk>: It's a story with the final <unk>, and it can decide he <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> away, <unk>.
<unk>: The last example, I have time to show you is a <unk>, I <unk>, to <unk> and <unk> music.
It's a <unk>, made of a <unk>, to <unk> and <unk> music.
<unk> here are <unk> by <unk> as the bottom and <unk>.
<unk> of these has four different <unk>, and you can choose what to use.
You can also <unk> these <unk> in a sequence of your <unk>.
And I just <unk> to make a <unk> and a <unk>. "
These are the effects of the live, like <unk> and <unk>.
I <unk> it to a particular sound and then <unk> to <unk>.
And then there are the <unk> effects of as time and <unk>, that <unk> to the entire sequence.
<unk> like this.
<unk>: <unk>: <unk> <unk> a <unk> in two <unk>, "<unk> in a series, the <unk> in a series, the <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
Now, you're going to take a line.
<unk>: <unk>: Now, <unk> <unk>:
<unk>: <unk>: And now I'm going to <unk> the <unk>, so I can control the effect from live.
<unk>: <unk>: I can <unk> the whole sequence of time, or on the other.
<unk>: <unk>: And now we're going to <unk> the <unk> to <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>: I can <unk> the <unk> <unk>. "
So I don't have to <unk> before, but I can <unk>, <unk> more or more <unk>.
And now, finally, I can <unk> the whole <unk> sequence on the left <unk> the <unk> <unk>.
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is to build new <unk> <unk> <unk> to how our brain work.
And today, I had time to show you one of the results of this <unk>, and also some possibilities that we try to bring out of the lab.
And the concept I want to <unk> is that it's <unk> this new generation of <unk> objects to <unk> with the media <unk>, that we want to do.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the time to talk to all of you.
I'm a <unk>.
<unk> books is my <unk>, but it's more than this, of course.
It's also love and <unk> of my life.
And I don't look like that.
But, I said, something particular happened in my life and in my life and in my career, which he <unk> me to <unk> the whole relationship with this job.
The particular thing is I <unk> wrote this book, this <unk> called "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
And the result is that everywhere you're <unk> now, people <unk> me as if I was <unk>.
<unk> -- <unk>, <unk>!
I'm going to <unk> and they say, "You don't fear to be able to do it more to me?
You don't fear to write for life without <unk> to <unk> all life without <unk> to make a book that could <unk> to somebody? "
What can you do? "
It's <unk>, you know.
But it could be worse, and I remember the <unk> over 20 years ago, when I <unk> to say -- I was a <unk> -- I wanted to be a <unk>.
I <unk> to the same <unk> <unk> by fear.
And people said, "Don't you know, I don't know that they have success?
You don't fear that the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>?
You're not afraid to do this <unk> for life without anything that you get out and die on a <unk> of a dreams with the mouth of <unk>? "
So, you know.
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is, "Yeah."
Yeah, I fear of all those things.
I always had fear.
And I also fear of a lot of other things that people can't <unk>.
How <unk> and other things <unk>.
But, as I do it, I thought, and I thought <unk> is why?
Is it <unk>?
It's <unk> that anyone who <unk> <unk> to be <unk> by a job that you feel in a job.
But what's so particular in the <unk> <unk> <unk> by <unk> <unk> <unk> in a way that other <unk> do not?
How me my father, for example, he was a <unk> <unk> and I didn't remember one time in his 40 years of activity in which he was asked if she was to be <unk>?
We never had -- that <unk> of the <unk> John, how it goes?
Don't you like this, <unk>?
<unk>, the engineers like a group of <unk>, <unk>, <unk> the <unk> of being <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We <unk>, we have enough this <unk>, and not only <unk>, but <unk> of all kinds of <unk>, we have this <unk> of being <unk> <unk>.
And they're not going to look at the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that, only in the <unk> century, <unk> young and often for them.
And even those who don't seem seem to be <unk> by their <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, before he died, in the last <unk> said, "Every book my book has <unk> me a little more <unk> than" a <unk> <unk> about the work of their life.
But we don't know when you say why we heard this stuff so long that we have completely <unk> and <unk> the <unk> that we have completely <unk> and <unk> that creativity and <unk> that art, at the end, <unk>, <unk> always at <unk>.
And the question I want to <unk> to all here today is, you know, you're agree with this idea?
It's good at you -- because it also <unk> by a <unk> of a <unk> distance to me, it doesn't go well for this <unk>.
I think it's <unk>.
And I think it's also <unk> and I don't want to <unk> <unk> in the next century.
I think it's better to <unk> our great <unk> to live.
And I know that, in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very <unk> to start to that <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in which I'm in my career.
<unk> -- <unk>, you look at it, I'm a young <unk>, I've about 40 years.
I still have about four <unk> of work in me.
And it's very <unk> that anything <unk> in the world as the job that will be <unk> by the world like the job that <unk> after the <unk> of my last book.
<unk> <unk>, because we are all about, and it's <unk> that my greatest success is to my <unk>.
Oh, <unk>, that thought!
You know this is the kind of thought that leads a person to start <unk> at the nine of the morning and I don't want to do it.
I'm going to continue to do this work that I love.
So, the question becomes, how?
And so, I think, after a lot of <unk>, that the way to work to write is what to create a <unk> <unk> <unk>, OK?
I have to have a <unk> distance of <unk> between me, which I'm <unk>, and my natural <unk> on what the <unk> <unk> to get to do, and I'm going to go through this time, <unk> models on how to do do it look through the time, trying to find other society to society to see if you could have better ideas and more <unk> ideas and <unk> ideas.
about how to help people <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity.
And that research has brought me to the <unk> <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> because I went to <unk> and then <unk> back.
<unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> -- people don't believe that creativity <unk> creativity <unk> by men, OK?
And it <unk> that creativity was this spirit <unk> <unk> and <unk> to men from a few <unk> <unk> and <unk>, for <unk> and <unk>, for <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> <unk> these <unk> <unk> of <unk> creativity.
<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, I would <unk> to have a <unk> that <unk> <unk> from far.
The <unk> were the same idea, but they <unk> that species of the spirit without a <unk>.
And the <unk> <unk>, because the <unk> didn't really <unk> that a <unk> was a very <unk>.
<unk> that a <unk> was this kind of <unk> <unk> that <unk> literally <unk> in the <unk> of the study of a artist, a little bit like <unk>, and that <unk> out of <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the artist and <unk> the <unk> of that I <unk> the <unk> of that work.
<unk> <unk>, this is the distance of which I'm talking -- that <unk> <unk> you from the results of your work.
And everyone <unk> that was so that we would <unk>, right?
So artists were <unk> by <unk>, like, for example, too <unk>, no?
If your job was <unk>, you didn't <unk> everything <unk>, all <unk> that <unk> had been <unk> by this <unk> <unk>.
If your job, it wasn't all <unk>, right?
Everybody <unk> that was your <unk> to be a <unk>.
And so people <unk> <unk> creativity in <unk> for a long time.
Then the <unk> <unk> and everything, and we <unk> this great idea; and we put the human being at the center of the universe above all of the universe, over the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> it without <unk>.
This was the principle of <unk> <unk> and people to think that creativity <unk> from <unk>.
And for the first time in the history, you <unk> to <unk> this or that artist as a <unk> as a person who's <unk> with <unk>.
And I have to <unk>, I think it was a big <unk>.
I think that somebody, a simple person to believe that they're like a source, <unk> and <unk> of all <unk> <unk>, <unk> and <unk> of all <unk> <unk>, <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> a <unk> of all the <unk> of human <unk>.
It's like to someone to <unk> the sun.
<unk> and <unk> the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> all these <unk> on the <unk>.
And I think it's been this pressure to have <unk> artists in <unk> 500 years.
And, if that's true, and I think it's, the question is, the question of it becomes, and now?
Can we do it?
It's going to go back to a <unk> understanding of human relationship between human and <unk>.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we can't <unk> 500 years of thinking in a <unk> <unk>.
And there's probably people in the audience who <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of <unk>, you do that <unk> people <unk> <unk> on their projects.
You probably don't <unk> you all about this.
But the question I'd like to <unk> is -- why not?
Why don't we <unk> this way?
Because it has more than anything that ever heard about to explain the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> process.
A process that, as anyone who ever <unk> to do something -- so, so <unk>, all, you know, you don't know <unk>.
And in fact, it can be completely <unk>.
I did this <unk> with the extraordinary <unk> <unk> <unk>, who has now 90 years, but it was a <unk> for life and said that during his <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk>, <unk> out in the <unk> <unk>, <unk> out in the <unk> <unk>, <unk> out in the <unk> <unk>, <unk> out of the <unk>.
He said he was like a <unk> <unk> of air.
And that <unk> to her from the <unk>.
I <unk> it, because he was <unk> the land under his feet.
I was to have one thing to do to that point and it was, words, "<unk> as a <unk>."
And so he was <unk> to the house and he was <unk> by this <unk>, and it didn't have to take a piece of paper and a <unk> enough enough to the <unk>, and <unk> on the page.
<unk> times times I couldn't start to be <unk>, so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and she would <unk> her <unk> through and she would <unk> to <unk> through the <unk>, looking for, as she said, "another <unk>."
And then there were those times -- this is not <unk>, there were some times when it was almost <unk>, OK?
So, he was coming home and he was looking at home and the <unk> through, and he <unk> up the <unk> through, and he <unk> a <unk> right in the while he was <unk> with the other hand and the <unk>.
<unk> the <unk> and the <unk> in his body and the <unk> on the page.
And in these cases, the <unk> would be <unk> on the <unk> page, and <unk>, but at the last word to the first word to the first.
So when I <unk> it -- it's <unk>, it's exactly <unk> to my <unk> process.
Not all my <unk> process -- I'm not a <unk>!
I'm a <unk>, and my way of <unk> is; it <unk> at the same <unk> every day and work and work and <unk> on it.
But even I, in my <unk>, I <unk> against that thing, sometimes.
And I think that many of you <unk> it.
You know, even though the job and ideas I <unk> me to a certain source I couldn't <unk>.
And what is this thing?
And how can we <unk> it to it so that we don't do our head, but rather, what do you do <unk>?
And as I <unk>, the best example, I <unk> <unk>, which I <unk> <unk>, which I <unk> different years ago for a <unk>.
<unk> of this, and you know, <unk>, for the <unk> of life has been the <unk> of the artist <unk> <unk>, trying to control, <unk> these species of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
But then <unk>, he <unk>, and a day while he was <unk> on a <unk> <unk>, <unk> everything for him.
<unk> and everything of a <unk>, this little <unk> of <unk>, that comes into his head as <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, but it doesn't know how to <unk>.
It's not a piece of paper, it doesn't have a <unk>.
So he starts to feel this kind of old <unk> to grow in him, "" I'm going to <unk>, and <unk> <unk> from this <unk> song.
I'm not enough <unk> and I can't <unk>. "
And instead of go to the <unk>, they <unk>.
<unk> the whole process and made something completely new.
He just <unk> the sky and said, "<unk>, you see, you see that I'm <unk>?"
"What's going to be that you can write a song now?
If you really want to <unk>, you will <unk> a <unk> moment when I can take care of you.
<unk>, <unk> to <unk> more <unk> today.
<unk> <unk> <unk>. "
And his <unk> process, he <unk> after this.
Not the job, it was still <unk> as always.
But the process, and the <unk> <unk> that <unk> was <unk> when <unk> the <unk>, the <unk> that he had been <unk> when he <unk>, the <unk> that he <unk> out of where, was <unk> that it had no thing and <unk>.
But I <unk> this <unk>, wonderful <unk> <unk> a conversation between <unk> and this thing that <unk> and <unk> that it was <unk> and <unk> that it was <unk>.
So how I <unk> that story is to change a little bit of a way that I <unk> and I <unk> and I <unk> once.
This idea, I <unk> when I was <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>," and I <unk>, "and I <unk> in one of those <unk> of the <unk> where we're <unk> when we're working on something and you can do, and you can think it's going to be a <unk>, that what will never wrote.
Not just <unk>, just the <unk> book.
And I started to think about <unk> this project.
But then I <unk> to <unk> that <unk> into the air and we <unk>.
So I <unk> my face on the <unk> and <unk> my <unk> to a <unk> corner of the room.
And I said to <unk>, "<unk>, what, we know, if this is not going to be <unk> my own, no?
Because as you see, I'm <unk> everything I have, I don't have more than this.
So if you want it to be better, you have to <unk> and do your part.
Okay. But if you don't do it, you know what, I'm not going to do it.
I'm going to write the same because it's my job.
And I'd like to you that it was <unk> that I <unk> to do my part of "Because -- at the end is so, OK -- <unk> is so, OK -- <unk> -- <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> of the moon, <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and hours to <unk>.
And they were always <unk>, because the <unk> were <unk> and <unk>.
But every <unk>, something <unk>, something <unk>, and one of these artists <unk> actually <unk>.
And I know what I'm talking about what I'm talking about, because I know that you have seen, at a <unk> like this.
It was like if you <unk>, and the <unk> <unk> through a kind of <unk> and it was <unk> through a kind of <unk> and it was doing anything different from the <unk>, but it was all <unk>.
And all of a sudden, not just like a human.
But they <unk> from <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> fire.
And when this <unk>, people <unk> what was, I <unk> that he was, he <unk> it with his name.
<unk> your hands and <unk> to <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, God," God, "God,"
That's God, you know.
<unk> <unk> -- when the <unk> <unk> <unk>, the <unk> of <unk>, <unk> this <unk> with them and <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> by "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, which you can hear in <unk> or in <unk>.
In <unk>, when a <unk> did something impossible and <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>," <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>," <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>
And it's <unk> because we need.
But, the problem comes the day after, for the <unk>, when you <unk> and <unk> that are the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> that are the <unk> of <unk> and <unk>.
It's just a <unk> with <unk> <unk>, and maybe you can never <unk> to that <unk> to <unk>.
And maybe no one <unk> the name of God still <unk>, and what's got to do with the rest of his life?
It's hard.
This is one of the most <unk> <unk> to do in a <unk> life.
But maybe it doesn't have to be so <unk> if you can't believe, <unk>, that the most <unk> of your being being from you.
But I just <unk> you get data into <unk> by a source of this <unk> part of your life that you have to <unk> else when you're finished.
And, you know, if we think that it's all changes.
And so I started to <unk>, and it's certainly like I <unk> for several months during the <unk> of the book that I was going to <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> of my <unk> success.
And what I have to keep <unk> when I feel like this is, I don't fear.
Don't <unk>. <unk> only your job.
<unk> to <unk>, whatever you can be.
If your job is <unk>, <unk>.
If the <unk>, you will <unk> to you <unk> <unk> some kind of <unk>, for one moment through your <unk>, then "<unk>!" <unk>! "
You do the same your <unk>.
And "<unk>!" <unk>! "
I think it's <unk>.
"<unk>!" <unk>! "You know, even for having had love and <unk> <unk> <unk> by <unk> <unk>.
Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk>: <unk>!
You know, I talked about some of these projects on the human genome, what can <unk> and the discovery of new <unk> of genes.
We're <unk> a new way: we started to <unk> biology and now start to start by that digital code, we're <unk> in a new <unk> of biology, <unk> and <unk> life.
We always tried to <unk> great questions.
"<unk> is life?" It's something that a lot of <unk>, I think they have <unk> to understand different levels.
We tried different <unk>, <unk> to <unk> terms.
We're <unk> by almost 20 years, now.
When we <unk> the human genome <unk> to <unk> from the <unk> world of biology biology to the digital world of the computer.
Now, we can <unk> life, or to create life, or create a new life from this digital universe?
This is the map of a little <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, which is the species from the genome genome between those that can <unk> in the lab.
And we tried to reduce <unk> the genome to <unk> a <unk>, a little bit smaller.
We can <unk> a <unk> of a <unk> of the <unk> of the 500 of the <unk> of the 500 of them here.
But when we look at his map <unk>, it's <unk> simple than our.
<unk>, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can <unk>, one at the time, it's very <unk> that this can bring a <unk> cell.
So I <unk> that the only way to <unk> was <unk> this <unk> <unk> to <unk> some of these questions.
And so we started the <unk> of the "We can <unk> a <unk>?"
Can the chemistry <unk> of these great molecules that we've never been able to create these big molecules that we've ever been able to create these great molecules that we never have been able to create these great molecules that we've never been able to create these big molecules that we've never been able
And, in case, we can make a <unk>?
A <unk> is just a piece of <unk> material.
The speed that we can <unk> life is <unk> to <unk>.
Our <unk> capacity, rather slowly, but it's <unk>, rather slowly slowly, but it's <unk>.
And our most <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We <unk> over 15 years ago.
The process has <unk> a lot of <unk>, <unk> with a <unk> <unk> before we <unk> the early experiments.
But we found that <unk> DNA is very hard.
There are <unk> of thousands of cars in the world that <unk> little <unk> of DNA <unk>, <unk> of 30 to 50 <unk> and it's a <unk> process. <unk>: the <unk> is long, the <unk> is long, the <unk> there are.
So we had to develop a new <unk> to <unk> these <unk> and <unk> the <unk>.
And this was our first <unk>, to start by digital information of the genome of <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's a little virus that <unk> bacteria.
We designed <unk>, <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> a <unk> of DNA <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The interesting part is when we took this piece of <unk> material, and we <unk> it into bacteria, bacteria have <unk> to read this code and <unk> the <unk> particles.
<unk> particles have been <unk> by cells, they <unk> back and they <unk> the <unk> <unk>.
I talked about with <unk> members of the <unk> industry that they have certainly <unk> this model.
They have more of you.
<unk> that this is a situation where the software can actually build his same <unk> in a <unk> system.
But we could do things in the greatest.
You could build the whole <unk> of <unk>.
They are more than <unk> <unk> of code.
So we thought of <unk> in <unk> of the size of the virus, so that we can change the <unk> to understand what the <unk> of a <unk> cell.
<unk> is <unk>, and if you <unk> information information in a computer, these must be very <unk>.
When I <unk> this genome for the first time in <unk> the <unk> <unk> was a <unk> for every 10 <unk> <unk>.
We found, 30 <unk>. If you <unk> that original sequence, you could never be able to do it.
A process of the process is design <unk> 50 <unk> that <unk> with all the other <unk> of 50 <unk> to build smaller <unk> to build smaller <unk> that <unk>.
<unk> elements here.
You know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you've got read that <unk>.
<unk> <unk>: We have a <unk> code on four <unk>: <unk>, <unk>, <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> of those <unk> <unk> together, and there's a <unk> order for every <unk>.
So we can use the code for <unk> to write words, <unk>, <unk>.
What we did at the beginning was <unk>.
Some of them have been <unk> by the fact that it wasn't <unk>.
We designed these <unk> to <unk> just <unk> with <unk>.
There are <unk> that we <unk> and <unk> them.
And we started <unk> of the parts, <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> in <unk> <unk>, <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to them to them <unk> <unk>.
But in every step, we have this <unk> in <unk> so that we're <unk> to create a <unk> <unk> as you see in a minute.
We're trying to <unk> the process.
So, this seems to be the <unk> of a <unk> <unk>.
When you start these <unk> very <unk>, much more than 100 <unk> <unk>, you don't get <unk> directly to the <unk> <unk>.
You get to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> biology.
So we have <unk> other <unk>.
<unk> of another <unk> called <unk> <unk>, which in biology <unk> to <unk> the DNA in order to <unk> the <unk>.
Here's an example.
This <unk>, called <unk> <unk>, can <unk> three million <unk> of <unk>.
You can see in the <unk> <unk> as his <unk> <unk> as his <unk> is <unk>.
And in 12 -- 24 hours is <unk> exactly like it was before.
<unk> thousands of organisms that are able to do it.
These organisms can <unk> completely.
We live under <unk>.
I'm absolutely sure that life <unk> in space, and you <unk> to find new <unk> of water.
And NASA has shown that this happens.
This is an image of the <unk> that we built using these <unk>, just by using these <unk> with the <unk> design of <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> them <unk>.
This is not <unk> with a <unk> <unk>, but with a <unk> <unk>.
It's a <unk> so big that we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk>.
These are pictures that <unk> a time of about six seconds.
This is the <unk> that we did a little time ago.
They are more than <unk> <unk> of code.
It's the largest <unk> of a <unk> structure ever <unk> by man.
It has a <unk> weight to 300 million.
If you <unk> it with a <unk> 10 without spaces, we'll <unk> pages to <unk> this <unk> code.
Now, how do we work? How do we <unk>?
<unk>, by a virus is a game.
It's a little bit more <unk> when you use bacteria.
It's more simple when it is about cells as well as our -- you can just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> another, which is basically the process of <unk>.
In <unk>, we <unk> the <unk> is instead of <unk> into the cell, but we <unk> that we are able to do a <unk> <unk> from a cell to another and <unk>.
We <unk> a <unk> <unk> by a kind of <unk>.
<unk> are the two different as men from <unk>.
We <unk> some <unk> in a way that we could decide what to choose to do for this <unk>.
He <unk> it up with <unk> in a way that we <unk> all the <unk>.
And when we put it in the cell was <unk> and <unk> our <unk> <unk> the new <unk> went into the cell.
And we had to <unk> that we didn't go beyond, but we tried to <unk> over there.
This is one of the <unk> of the <unk>.
We found that <unk> species have <unk> a second or a third <unk> from some of the <unk>, <unk> in a second thousands of new <unk> to that species.
So who think about evolution as a <unk> as a <unk> at the time that you <unk> doesn't understand a lot of biology.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> DNA.
The <unk> that was in the cell didn't <unk> one.
The <unk> <unk> we <unk> it.
It's <unk>, and it <unk> the other <unk> as <unk>, has <unk>, and we <unk> with only the cell and the new <unk>.
It's become blue because of the genes that we <unk>.
And in a short short time, all the <unk> of a <unk>, and it <unk> of a species, <unk> on the new software that we <unk> into a new species, <unk> on the new software that we <unk> into the cell.
All the <unk> are <unk>, the <unk> are <unk>, and when you <unk> the code <unk> exactly what we've <unk>.
Now, this may seem <unk> <unk>, but we can <unk> the software things that we can change things in a <unk> <unk>.
Now, I've already <unk> that you don't talk about <unk> -- but of progress that we're going to be <unk> -- but in the <unk> of evolution, and I said that maybe we're going to create a new version of <unk> <unk> that we <unk> new species on this digital process.
Why do that?
I think it's enough to <unk> when we think about our <unk>.
We're going to <unk>, and a half billion people to <unk> billion in the next 40 years.
Right to give an example: I was born in <unk>.
Now there are three people on the planet to <unk> <unk>; in 40 years, there will be four.
We're <unk> problems now to find food, water and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> for six billion people.
We're even <unk> to do it for nine billion.
<unk> over five billion <unk>, over 30 billion <unk>, over 30 billion <unk>.
That means 100 million <unk> a day.
When we try to find <unk> <unk>, or any kind of process to <unk>, it's going to be a huge challenge.
And we have to realize all of the CO2 <unk> by these materials that <unk> in the atmosphere.
And so, today, because of the <unk> <unk> in the world, we have a <unk> with about 20 million genes, and I like to think that are the <unk> <unk> for the future.
The <unk> industry only one <unk> about <unk>, and you think about how many different things are <unk> out.
Our <unk> here is <unk> data from the <unk> reality and our imagination.
Now we have <unk>, thank you to these <unk> <unk> of <unk>, able to create what we call <unk> <unk>.
We can build a big robot that can produce a big robot that can produce a million <unk> a day.
Think of <unk> these 20 million different genes or try to <unk> the <unk> to produce <unk> or <unk>, new <unk>, we can change, with a little team, and to create more <unk> biology that we can change, with a little team, and create more <unk> biology than the last 20 years of science.
And it's just a standard <unk>.
We can choose to <unk>, <unk> chemistry or <unk>, <unk>, <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
This is a <unk> of some software <unk> that we're working on to be able to <unk> and design species on the computer.
Well, we don't know how they're going to be.
We know exactly what their code is.
Now we're <unk> about the <unk> of <unk>.
You see you also see that <unk> from the <unk> was a <unk> experiment.
We <unk> <unk> and <unk>, and the third generation that we're going to be <unk> by <unk> of <unk> as <unk> or different kinds of <unk>.
But the only way that biology can reach this purpose, and we think we can have the first <unk> of food and <unk> the <unk> would be <unk> CO2 in matter, so we're working on to design cells that can reach to design that can reach that, and we think we can get the first <unk> of <unk> generation in about 18 months.
<unk> <unk> with CO2 is a <unk>, but in our <unk> <unk>, we found different <unk>.
This is a <unk> that we've <unk> in <unk>.
<unk> in the ocean, at about <unk> feet of <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> by using hydrogen <unk> as a source of energy.
We're trying to understand if we can <unk> CO2, that can easily be <unk> by <unk>, <unk> that CO2 in <unk>, to drive this process.
So, we think of a short <unk> that we might be able to <unk> what the <unk> is life. We <unk>, we <unk> the <unk> <unk> the whole <unk> of <unk> the whole <unk> industry.
<unk>. If you can't do it from TED, where you can't do it from TED, where you can't do it from TED, where you can't do it from TED, where you can't do it from TED, where you can't do it from TED, where you can't do it.
It's a source of energy.
<unk>, we're working for the same <unk> to create <unk>.
You see this year with flu, we've always come back of a year and a dollar in less when it's about find the <unk> <unk>.
I think what you can change building <unk> <unk> in <unk>.
So, this is how the future might start to look <unk>, now, the tree of evolution, <unk> the <unk> by bacteria, <unk>, <unk> cells, <unk>, <unk> cells.
We are at so <unk> people.
Our purpose is to make a way of living enough to <unk>. Thank you very much.
<unk>, all I'm going to show you, the <unk> <unk> possible, some <unk>, in the technology that we've brought to <unk> to a <unk> almost a year ago. This is <unk>.
It's a environment that you can <unk> is <unk> to local level that <unk> with an enormous amount of <unk> data.
And we're seeing <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> with a kind of <unk> and <unk>, for a fast <unk>, <unk> the images like we want.
And it doesn't matter how big it is the amount of information that we see, how big these <unk> of data or data.
Most of them are <unk> photographs, but this for example is a <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of the <unk>, and <unk> in the <unk> of 300 <unk>.
It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that <unk> the <unk> of a system like this is the number of <unk> on your screen at any time. It's also a very <unk> architecture.
This is a book book.
This is the <unk> <unk>. Every <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk>.
And to <unk> that it's just about the text and not images, we can do something like that, to see that it's a real <unk> of the text, not of a picture.
It could be a way to read a <unk> book.
I don't know it.
This is an <unk> example. It's a number of the <unk>.
Every image is the beginning of a <unk>.
And it really gives you the pleasure and the beautiful experience of the real <unk> version of a <unk> or a <unk>, which is for nature a <unk> kind of a <unk>, which is for a <unk> kind of a <unk>.
We also did something with the corner of this particular number of the <unk>.
We created a <unk> <unk> <unk> much higher than you can use in a normal <unk>, and we <unk> the <unk> content.
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk>, you can see here.
Or other models, or even <unk> <unk>.
And this really <unk> some of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of space on the screen.
<unk> that this <unk> to put into <unk> and other <unk> like this, we can't be <unk>.
Of course, the <unk> is one of the most <unk> <unk> for this kind of technology.
And on this <unk>, I don't want to lose time, if not to say we have <unk> to do this field.
These are all the <unk> in the United States <unk> above a <unk> picture of NASA.
So now I'm going to do something else.
This is actually in the web; you can <unk> to see it.
It's a project called <unk>, which <unk> two different technologies.
One is <unk> and the other is a <unk> research <unk> computers, a very interesting <unk> that made by <unk>, a student of the <unk> <unk> of Washington, with the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. <unk>. A <unk>.
And it's alive on the web, <unk>.
You can see when we do this kind of <unk>, where we can go from an image to the other and have this kind of experience in <unk> <unk>.
But the <unk> of the images of this is actually actually a meaning.
The <unk> of <unk> computers have <unk> these images together, so that they <unk> to <unk> where the <unk> all <unk> <unk> to the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> have been <unk>. And so you see the elements of a <unk> or <unk>, and these things are all <unk> at <unk>, and these things are all <unk> at <unk> at <unk> level.
I don't know if I have time to show you some other environment.
There are a lot more <unk>.
I want to go to one of the <unk> data of <unk> and this <unk> by a <unk> <unk> of <unk> that we did work for the first time the summer to show you what <unk> is really the key to show you what <unk> is really the key to the website.
We had to <unk> <unk> and <unk> and forth.
This is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> images. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> images of kinds of <unk> and <unk> images of kinds of <unk> and <unk> and <unk> of the <unk> and on the <unk> and <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> an image that you have to this model.
So I'm all <unk> images from <unk> and you're all <unk> to <unk> in this way.
And it's possible to <unk> this <unk>.
You know, I would never have thought of work for <unk>.
It's very <unk> <unk> this kind of <unk> here.
I think you can see that it's a lot of different kinds of <unk>: from those cell phones to those <unk> <unk>, a number of <unk>, <unk> together in this environment.
And if I can, I <unk> to try to find those <unk>.
A lot of <unk>, etc.
And in this is a series of photographs -- <unk>.
This is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We can go from the <unk> to physics of this environment.
The point is we can do things with social things with social environment. This is now <unk> data from the whole memory of how to <unk> the land, from the <unk> point of view and <unk> all that data.
All those pictures become <unk> together, more than the <unk>.
You have a model of the entire land that <unk>.
Think about this as <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> on Earth <unk>.
It's something that <unk> in complexity, as people <unk>, and the <unk> that I <unk> for who who <unk> it with the <unk>.
They are <unk> with <unk> <unk> by other people.
If somebody is the idea of <unk> all these <unk> <unk> the name, my picture of the <unk> <unk> <unk> of all those data, and I can use as a <unk> point of <unk> to <unk> in that space, using the <unk>, using the photos of anyone else, and have a social experience of <unk>.
Of course, a <unk> of all that are <unk> <unk> very <unk> of every interesting part of the land, <unk> not only by <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk>.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I realized? What your software <unk> us to do is that at a certain point, in the next few years, all the <unk> of the <unk> will be <unk> together?
<unk>: Yeah. What's doing is basically, we find it.
It's creating <unk>, if you want, between images.
And it's doing it in the <unk> of images.
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about <unk> information information that a lot of these <unk> images.
As you do a research of images on the web, you <unk> a <unk> and the text on the <unk> page has a lot of information about the images.
Now, what happens if that picture you <unk> to all your picture?
So the amount of <unk> <unk> and the amount of <unk> that <unk> is really enormous. It's a <unk> effect of the network.
CA: <unk>, it's really incredible. <unk>.
<unk>: I'm going to <unk>.
One of the main <unk> when you <unk> and one of the <unk> research is that we can live in who doesn't <unk> the <unk> <unk>, who <unk> the past the wind, the <unk> <unk> <unk> by <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> by <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
You think that <unk> <unk> <unk> still beyond <unk> <unk> <unk>, or that the <unk> of <unk> <unk> are still <unk> of <unk>, or <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, or <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, to remember the <unk> of <unk>, and that the idea that the world that the idea that the world that the world that we don't live in <unk> sense, but only a model of the <unk>, but it is a <unk>.
the <unk> of a particular <unk> of choices that our <unk> has done, good or bad, a lot of <unk> does.
And, of course, all of course, <unk> <unk>.
<unk>. <unk>. <unk>.
We are <unk> to <unk>.
We have to <unk> the death <unk>, so we don't <unk> and <unk> --
We all have a art.
What <unk> is the <unk> <unk> of the song, the <unk> of <unk> of every culture.
It doesn't matter that they're the <unk> of <unk>, or the <unk> of <unk>, or the <unk> of <unk> <unk>, or the <unk> <unk> <unk>, or a <unk> in the <unk> of <unk>.
He was my <unk> of journey in <unk> a <unk> a month ago, or a <unk> of <unk> in the <unk> <unk>, the <unk> mother's <unk>.
All these <unk> <unk> us that there are other ways of thinking, other ways to think, other ways to move in the world.
And, if you look at a moment, it's a concept that can give you hope.
<unk>, the <unk> of <unk> world create a <unk> life and <unk> that <unk> the planet and it's important for the <unk> of the planet as the <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk>.
And you can think about this <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and you can <unk> the <unk> of all the <unk>, dreams, dreams, <unk>, <unk>, dreams, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> to be <unk> in the <unk> of <unk>.
<unk> is the <unk> <unk> of humanity.
It's the <unk> of what we are and what we can be as as much as <unk> species.
And <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> has happened to <unk> and <unk> very quickly.
<unk> <unk>, for example, <unk> that 50 percent of all species has been or <unk> on the <unk> of <unk> because it's <unk>, or <unk> -- the <unk> <unk>, or <unk> -- the <unk> <unk> -- and you don't even <unk> to the <unk> <unk> -- that diversity.
<unk> of this is, of course, the <unk> <unk>.
When you're <unk> <unk> <unk> on this planet.
A <unk> is not just <unk> by a <unk> or a series of rules.
A is the <unk> of the <unk> of the human spirit.
It's the middle of which the <unk> of every culture comes in the world.
Every language is a forest of mind, a <unk>, a <unk>, a <unk> of <unk>.
And of those <unk> <unk>, as we are here in <unk>, at least half the <unk> of children.
They're no longer <unk> to children, which means, <unk>, <unk> that means less than something, which are already death.
What's more <unk> than the <unk> of being <unk> by the <unk>, of being the last to talk about a language, the <unk> of <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of <unk>'s children?
This <unk> has been the state of somebody in a few weeks, every two weeks, a <unk> <unk> and <unk> it to itself in <unk> <unk> the <unk> of a <unk>.
And I know somebody of you say, "I don't it better?
The world would not be a better place if we all <unk> the same language? "<unk>, then we talk to all <unk>. <unk>.
<unk> <unk>.
<unk> of a <unk>, what it means to be able to talk about their language.
I'd like to give you a journey through the <unk> --
a little journey in the <unk> to give you a <unk> of what we're <unk>.
Many of us <unk> that when I say, "different ways of <unk>," I mean a lot of different ways of <unk>.
<unk> for example, this <unk> <unk>, in <unk> <unk>, the <unk> of <unk>, which <unk> to the <unk> of <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's a <unk> that's not <unk> the blue color from green because the green <unk> because the time is <unk> in the forest, where the forest <unk>.
They have a <unk> language and a rule, <unk>, "<unk> <unk>," <unk>: you have to <unk> a person who's <unk> a different language.
And all of that has <unk> in the past <unk>, yet <unk> is that in these families <unk> in which they talk about six or seven <unk> because of the <unk> <unk> <unk> no <unk>.
It's <unk> to listen and then you start talking about.
<unk> one of the most interesting <unk> that I lived, the <unk> <unk> <unk>, an amazing <unk> that had the first <unk> in <unk>.
In <unk> five <unk> have <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk>.
They've <unk> by the top photographs that <unk> them in <unk> that <unk> <unk>, <unk> that this <unk> of the <unk> <unk> had never seen anything about <unk>.
They <unk> the picture from the land, they <unk> to <unk> a form or a <unk> and, they didn't <unk>, they <unk> that <unk> <unk> of <unk>, and they <unk> the five <unk> with <unk>.
But <unk> don't only <unk> <unk>.
They <unk> between them.
<unk> percent of the <unk> was <unk> by them.
We're <unk> to eight <unk> and we found two cases and we found two cases to know, they <unk> that one of them was <unk> so that he's dead, and then they <unk> it.
<unk> were able to recognize the animal <unk> from 40 <unk> and <unk> the species.
<unk> years early '<unk>, I was <unk> a very interesting job when my <unk> <unk> to <unk> my <unk> if I wanted to go to <unk> between society at the <unk> of <unk> and <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> of <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to make <unk>.
To make sense of <unk>, I should understand the <unk> culture and that <unk> is not <unk>.
It's quite a <unk> vision of the world.
Very interesting.
If you try to <unk> the great <unk> of the world, what me do I <unk>?
<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, etc.
A continent is always <unk> out, thinking that Africa <unk> doesn't have <unk> <unk>. And instead, the <unk> is not the other than the <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
What makes the <unk> is the <unk> relationship between life and death.
So <unk> are <unk> to <unk>.
<unk> can be <unk> by the <unk> <unk>, <unk> to the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> in the <unk> of the live in in the <unk> of the <unk>, the <unk> becomes the <unk>.
And so the <unk> to say, "<unk> <unk> go to <unk> to talk about God.
We <unk> in <unk> and <unk> God. "
And the moment you're <unk>, is the spirit that you can <unk> you, you can make you <unk>?
So, you <unk> to these incredible events: <unk> <unk> in the state of <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> a pretty <unk> of the power of mind when it <unk> in a state of <unk> <unk>.
<unk> all the <unk> that I have lived the most <unk> <unk> are the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, in the <unk> <unk>.
<unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> once <unk> on the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
In a <unk> continent of blood, this <unk> never had <unk> by <unk>.
<unk> today are <unk> by a <unk>, but their education is extraordinary.
<unk> are <unk> away from families to three or four years, and they live in a world fact that they're <unk> in a world <unk> and <unk> in <unk> <unk> to the base of the <unk> for 18 years.
Two <unk> of nine years <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And all of this time, they're <unk> to their <unk>, values that they <unk> and only their <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or to <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or to say <unk> <unk>.
And this incredible <unk>, they <unk> out and for the first time in their life, at age 18 years, see a <unk>. And in that moment of the first <unk>, when the sun <unk> <unk>, when the sun <unk> <unk> <unk>, everything they have learned in <unk> theory in all the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, everything that they learned in <unk> theory is <unk> in <unk>. The <unk> says a <unk> does a <unk>. The <unk> is a <unk>.
"<unk>? I'm going to tell you.
It's <unk>. Now it's in you <unk>. "
They call <unk> <unk> and they say that we, <unk> <unk>, we are the <unk> of the world.
This level of <unk> is extremely important.
When we think about <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> environment and the old history of <unk>, which is a <unk> in his <unk> or maybe maybe <unk> and say that these <unk> are <unk> to the Earth.
<unk> <unk> are not <unk> or <unk> by the <unk>.
There is no space for these things in the <unk> <unk> of <unk> or <unk> <unk> of <unk>, but because of time and <unk>, they created a <unk> of the Earth <unk> doesn't work on the concept of <unk> <unk>, but on a <unk> <unk>. It's <unk> <unk>. The concept that the Earth can live because it only is <unk> by human <unk>.
What does that mean?
You know, you know, a <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> that the mountain is a <unk> of <unk> that <unk> its <unk> is going to be a different human being <unk>. And that <unk> is going to be a very different relationship with the mountain or that <unk> that <unk> a mountain of <unk> to be <unk>.
<unk> is a <unk> of a spirit or a <unk> is <unk>.
What's interesting is the <unk> that <unk> the relationship between <unk> and <unk>.
I grew in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that the <unk> <unk> to be <unk>.
That made me a human being different of my friends who believe that <unk> are the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> of <unk> and <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> of <unk> and <unk> that live in the <unk> <unk>.
If we can <unk> that these <unk> can create very different, we start to understand some of their <unk> <unk>. It's <unk> this <unk>.
I <unk> this picture in <unk> <unk>.
Maybe some of you have heard about <unk>, the most powerful <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk>.
What makes the <unk> is not the potential <unk> of <unk>, but his <unk>. It's <unk> by two elements.
On one side, this <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> a series of <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, <unk>.
<unk> the only <unk> you have a <unk> <unk> that <unk> a little bit of the <unk>, but it's <unk> with the <unk> of a <unk>'s family <unk> said.
This <unk> <unk> <unk>, very similar to <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
If you're going to see the <unk> <unk> <unk>, which they do from a different <unk> of species, <unk> has <unk>.
<unk> that <unk> on the <unk> is a little bit like being <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a sea of electricity. [<unk>] [<unk>].] Don't make a <unk> of reality.
I often <unk> with my <unk>, Richard <unk> <unk>, the man who <unk> the <unk> was <unk>, with his discovery of <unk> <unk> in the <unk>.
<unk> my <unk> you can't <unk> these <unk> as a <unk> because if you're done you can't tell anybody to be <unk>. [<unk>] [<unk>] <unk>, but they can't be <unk> because they're <unk> by a <unk> that you find <unk>, of course.
It's possible to <unk> only if you <unk> with other <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk>.
Now, the <unk> that are <unk>. The <unk> that are in this <unk> are <unk> of <unk>, the same kind of necessary for <unk>. The question <unk> <unk>: in a <unk> of plants, how these <unk> to <unk> two <unk> <unk>, they do not like this, but that if you <unk> in this way, they create a <unk>, they create a <unk> that's <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk>?
We use the great <unk> of <unk> and <unk>, which can <unk> <unk>.
But if you look at the <unk>, we <unk> "<unk>" <unk> "<unk>" <unk> "<unk>" <unk> "<unk>" <unk> "."
What does that mean?
This <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> in the forest, and that our eyes in the same species.
If you look at them as <unk> their <unk>, we <unk> <unk> of plants, the rest of the rest of the rest of the <unk>. "I said," No. "
The solution is: you take the <unk> <unk> in a night of moon and <unk> with a different <unk>.
With this not you can't get to <unk>, but it's much more interesting than <unk> <unk>.
Now, [<unk>] the problem is that even those of us who have heart <unk> <unk> them find them <unk>, but somehow <unk> to the <unk> of history than our real world, and it's beyond.
In fact, the <unk> century, in 300 years, <unk>, not <unk> for his <unk> or his <unk> <unk>, but rather like the was where we <unk> and we <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> the mass of diversity and <unk> and <unk> of the planet. Now the problem is not the change.
All the <unk> have been <unk> in a <unk> for new possibilities of life.
And the problem is not technology.
<unk> <unk> have no <unk> to be <unk> when they put <unk> <unk> and <unk> as the <unk> have <unk> as <unk> have <unk> when they <unk> from <unk> and <unk>.
It's not the change or technology that <unk> the <unk> of <unk>. It's power.
The <unk> <unk> of <unk>.
And if you look at the world, I would <unk> that these are not <unk> to <unk>.
They are <unk> creatures and <unk> out of the existence of <unk> forces that go beyond their <unk> <unk>.
<unk> that <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> --
a <unk> <unk> of <unk>, in <unk> <unk>, a <unk> that has lived <unk> and <unk> to a generation ago, and now <unk> to the <unk> and <unk> on the <unk> of <unk>, where you can see the <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk>,
We start to <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> to the forest.
Or, in the case of <unk>, are the diseases that are <unk> with the discovery of <unk>.
If you go on the <unk> of the <unk>, where I'm doing a lot of research, you'll see the <unk> <unk> of politics.
As <unk>, <unk> physics, the <unk> physics of a <unk>, is <unk> at <unk>, but the <unk>, the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk>, not only is <unk>, but <unk> in certain <unk>, because it's part of <unk>.
And you can't understand the <unk> of <unk> until you don't part of the beginning.
I <unk> miles from <unk> in China through the <unk> <unk>, <unk> to <unk> with a young <unk>, but only come to <unk> with a young <unk>, but only come to <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> million people <unk> from the <unk> <unk> during the <unk> <unk>.
The father of this guy was <unk> to the <unk> <unk>.
And the one means that it was <unk> to the Chinese days of Chinese <unk>.
<unk> <unk> is <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk>, which brought the <unk> in <unk>.
My mother was <unk> and his <unk> was being <unk>.
It was brought to <unk> in <unk> at age age of two <unk> <unk>, because he couldn't have a living without him.
The <unk>, who did the same, was <unk> in <unk>.
A day <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>, for this <unk>, was <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> for seven years.
<unk> pain can be <unk>, but the spirit of the <unk> is <unk> by <unk> present.
At the end, everything is <unk> to a choice.
We live in the <unk> world of <unk> or we want to <unk> the <unk> world of diversity?
The great <unk> <unk>, before he died said that his greatest fear was that, in our <unk> to go to this <unk> vision of the world, not only <unk> the whole <unk> of the human imagination <unk> to a <unk> <unk> of <unk> to a <unk> <unk> that there were other possibilities.
And it's <unk> to remember that our species is <unk> for <unk> years.
The <unk> <unk>, which has given us to agriculture, which has <unk> us to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk>, <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> with the <unk> of <unk>, creating the <unk> of <unk>, creating the <unk> of <unk>, and we talk about <unk> years ago.
The <unk> world has to <unk> 300 years.
And that <unk> story I didn't know, we have the answers to all the challenges that we could <unk> in <unk> to come.
When these <unk> of <unk> world is asked what it wants to be human, <unk> with <unk> different <unk>.
And it's in these answers that we all <unk> the chance of being what we are: a <unk> species that it has to make all the <unk> and all the <unk> can <unk>. And there are great times.
I <unk> this picture on the <unk> <unk> of <unk>, when I went to <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk>, and this man, <unk>, <unk> me the wonderful story of his <unk>.
The government <unk> was not always <unk> with the <unk> <unk> and in the '<unk> to <unk> our <unk>, we <unk> them in <unk>.
The <unk> of this man is <unk>.
The family, <unk> for his life, <unk> away all the <unk>, and all his <unk>.
You know that <unk> doesn't <unk> the cold, <unk>.
The <unk> of <unk> in <unk>, they were made of fish <unk> in the <unk>.
The <unk> of this man didn't <unk> by night or <unk> <unk>.
It's <unk> away, you <unk> the <unk> in your hand. When I did it <unk>, he <unk> it into your hand. When I did it <unk>, he's <unk>, he <unk> it to make a <unk>.
He <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk> of <unk> and when <unk> <unk>, he <unk> a dog.
He <unk> the dog and created a <unk>, with the <unk> <unk> has created a <unk>, and he <unk> a <unk>, and it's <unk> on the <unk>, <unk> in <unk>.
<unk> to talk about anything? [<unk>] [<unk>]. That, in different ways, [<unk>] is the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and all the <unk> <unk> of the world.
<unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> government has <unk> to <unk> the <unk> of an area of <unk> bigger <unk> of California and <unk>.
It's their new <unk>. It's called <unk>.
It's a <unk>. <unk> all the <unk> resources.
One <unk> example of how a <unk> can <unk> with his <unk>.
And, to end, I think it's quite <unk> at least at least at the <unk> of the planet, that they realize that they don't be <unk> at all.
For somebody is home.
<unk> <unk> of human imagination that <unk> to <unk> <unk>. And for us all, the dreams of these children, like dreams of our children, as a dreams of our children, become part of the <unk> <unk> of hope.
To end, we <unk> <unk>, we are <unk> that <unk> <unk> never to anything.
I <unk> that <unk> --
<unk> <unk> are not <unk>, but we believe that stories can change the world, and maybe we are the best <unk> to tell stories about the world. Every month our <unk> <unk> <unk> million <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> our <unk>.
Our <unk> are <unk> by millions of people.
Our job is <unk> in <unk> to bring our public to <unk> to <unk> our public places that <unk> from which <unk> from which <unk> how they saw and, <unk>, <unk> to <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and we have to find a <unk> of life in a <unk> world and <unk>.
where <unk> of all <unk> can <unk> our <unk> to our <unk>.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some of the things I wrote in this book that I hope you've heard and <unk> some <unk>, in the case you've heard and <unk> some <unk>, in the case you can't get them.
I want to start with what I call the <unk> <unk>.
What's <unk> of what?
The <unk> of all society <unk> <unk>. The <unk> <unk>: "If we want to <unk> our citizens." The way to do it is <unk> the <unk> freedom to do it is <unk> the freedom <unk>. "
The reason is, on one side, in fact that the freedom is, in itself a value, is <unk>, <unk> for humans.
<unk> is in fact that if we are <unk>, each of us can act to do everything that <unk> our <unk>, without no one <unk> in our <unk>.
The way to <unk> the freedom is to <unk> choice.
More choices people, the more <unk> are <unk>, and more is their freedom, and the <unk> of their <unk>.
This, <unk>, it's so <unk> <unk> in society that no one <unk> <unk> in <unk>.
And it's also <unk> <unk> in our lives.
I'm going to show you some examples of what progress <unk> has made possible.
This is my <unk>. It's not particularly big.
I <unk> a simple note on the <unk> to <unk>.
In my <unk>, there are <unk>, without <unk> the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> that you can buy for a huge number of <unk> in the <unk> <unk> that no one of the <unk> <unk> that nobody of <unk> <unk> is <unk>.
That's what <unk> is.
Then you go to the store store to buy a <unk>: <unk>, radio, <unk>, <unk>, radio, <unk>.
And in this <unk> store, there's a lot of <unk> <unk>.
We can make six million of different <unk> using the <unk> that there are in a <unk>.
<unk> <unk> that there is <unk> choice.
<unk> <unk>: the world of <unk>.
Once I was a child, you could get all the <unk> <unk>, to <unk> that they were <unk> by <unk>.
It's not <unk> the phone, you don't <unk> it.
A <unk> of that, in the other, was that the phone never <unk>.
These days, they went to.
We have a <unk> <unk> of <unk>, especially between cell phones.
Here's the <unk> of the future.
My <unk> is in the middle, <unk> <unk>, <unk>, and <unk> for <unk> <unk>.
If you don't have yet seen in the <unk> store, you're quite quite <unk> that soon <unk>.
And what happens is that people <unk> in <unk> and does this question. And you know, what's the answer? The answer is, "No.
It's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn't do things.
So, in other <unk> of life that are much more important than <unk>, you know, the same <unk> of choices.
<unk> <unk>: It doesn't go to the United States that you're <unk> from the <unk> and the <unk> you what you have to do.
Instead, I'll <unk> from <unk>, and the <unk> says, "OK, we might do it." Or <unk>, "<unk>," <unk> has these <unk> and these <unk>. What do you want to do? "
You <unk> them, "<unk>, what do you do?"
And the <unk> says, "<unk> has these <unk> and these <unk>, and these <unk>, and these <unk>."
"What do you want to do?"
And you say, "<unk> if she was me, what would you say?"
And the <unk>: "But I'm not she."
The <unk> we call it "<unk> <unk>", "<unk>", "<unk> that makes it look look like a <unk>.
But actually, it's not a <unk> the weight and <unk> of making decisions from someone who knows something, <unk> the <unk>, to <unk>, to <unk> that nothing knows -- and it's <unk> -- and so it's not <unk> -- and so it doesn't know -- and it's not <unk> to make the patient.
There is a huge <unk> of products, <unk> to people like me and you, if you think about it doesn't make sense, because you think about it.
But if we can't <unk>, why do we <unk> them?
The answer is that they want to <unk> <unk> to <unk> the <unk>.
<unk> of so fundamental as it is our <unk>, we have a question of choice, how you see in this <unk>. "We don't want to <unk> children. We don't want to <unk> children. We have to <unk>.
And we can <unk> how many times we <unk>.
And that means that every <unk>, you have to decide that kind of person being like person.
<unk> to the family and <unk>, a <unk> time perspective, <unk> to anyone, was that you <unk> the <unk> as possible, and they <unk> to get kids as possible, and they could get the <unk> as possible.
The only real choice was with who, not when, and we didn't know what to do after.
<unk>, everything is really to play.
<unk> to very smart, and they <unk> them 20 percent less <unk> of work at a time.
And not because they're less <unk>, not because they're less <unk>.
But why I'm <unk>, I <unk> to <unk>, "<unk> or not?"
"<unk> <unk> <unk>? I have to think before kids or to career?"
I'm <unk> <unk>.
And they try to answer these questions, even though this <unk> doesn't <unk> the <unk> that <unk> and you don't get a <unk> <unk> to my <unk>.
And they really have to do it. They are important questions.
Now, the job: we're <unk>, as <unk>, because technology allows us to work every minute, from every day to the planet, <unk> that from <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, there is a <unk>, and I won't say anybody who, where the <unk> works.
I don't say it, because I want to use it.
What means, this incredible freedom of choice that we have about work? Is that we have to decide, <unk> at every moment, if we have to work or not.
We can go to see our son to play <unk>, with the <unk> in a <unk>, the other, and the <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> on <unk>.
And even though I'm all <unk>, every minute that we see our son, <unk> the <unk>, we're also <unk>, "I <unk> to this call?"
"I have to answer this <unk>? I have to <unk> this letter?"
And even when the answer is, "no, this makes the experience of your son very different than what would be in other conditions.
So, from any part of us, we look at, small, and large objects, life is a question of choices.
Once the world was this: <unk>, there were some possibilities, but it was a question of choice.
The world of today I'm going to do this: The <unk> is, "Is it a <unk>, or <unk>?"
The answer is <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, we all know, so I'm going to talk about <unk>.
<unk> this choice is two effects of people who are <unk> people.
The first one, <unk>, is that it <unk> instead of <unk>.
With a lot of <unk> that you choose, it becomes very hard to do it.
I'll give you an example of a <unk>: a <unk> study on <unk> <unk>.
A <unk> had access to data of <unk>, <unk> society <unk>, with about a million <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk>, with about a million <unk> in <unk> <unk>.
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are <unk>, the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> 2 percent.
With 50 <unk>, there's 10 percent less than <unk> when they're <unk> only available five. <unk>?
Because in 50 <unk> of which you choose, and it's hard to decide, and the choice is <unk> to <unk>.
And <unk>, and again, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and of course, <unk> never comes.
<unk> that doesn't just mean that these <unk> <unk> <unk> because they can't have enough money, it also wants to say that the decision is so <unk> that it also <unk> the <unk> of <unk> work.
They're not <unk>, they're <unk> to five <unk> <unk> per year from <unk> <unk>, that would be <unk> to <unk>.
So the <unk> is a <unk> of having <unk> choices.
And I think it's going to be the world.
"And to end, to the <unk>: <unk>, <unk>, <unk>?"
You know, you can just take the right decision, if it's for <unk>, right?
You don't want to choose the wrong, and you <unk> the wrong <unk>.
So this is the first effect. The second is that even if we can <unk> <unk> and make a choice, at the end of the result of how we <unk> have been <unk> by the <unk> of how you <unk> have to choose.
And that's for a few reasons.
One of these is that with a lot of <unk> between which you choose, if you <unk> one and it's not perfect, it's easy to imagine that that it would be better. And what happens is that the <unk> <unk> <unk> us to <unk> the choice, and the <unk> <unk> the <unk> from the decision, and the <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> from the decision.
And even when it was a <unk> decision.
<unk>, you have, more choices, it's easier to <unk> than <unk> <unk>.
<unk>, there is what <unk> call.
Dan <unk> has <unk> very well as the value that we give things to things that we give to things that <unk>.
<unk>, when you have a lot of <unk>, it's easy to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and <unk> of the <unk> <unk> that you're <unk>.
Here's an example. I <unk> with all the people who are not in New York.
But that's what you probably do.
There's this <unk> to <unk>.
A <unk> place.
<unk> <unk>. <unk> day. It's all for them.
It's nothing. But what he thinks it's, "Well, <unk>, <unk>, it's <unk>."
"All my <unk> are away."
"<unk> <unk> <unk> right in the house."
And it's going to go to two weeks from the idea that's going to be -- every day -- the chance of <unk> where it wants.
The <unk> <unk> for what we have, even when the choice was <unk>.
And the <unk> we have from <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk> us to <unk> against how <unk>.
Here's another example.
This <unk> tells us a lot of things.
We think about a moment, and maybe a living time.
But the most important point is that anything you want, you <unk> to not do other.
The things that don't <unk> have a lot of <unk> that can make less <unk> what we do.
<unk>: <unk> <unk> of <unk>.
I tried it on my skin <unk> a new couple of <unk>.
It's always <unk>.
Once the <unk> were one of a <unk>, <unk> them and <unk>, were <unk>, only after <unk> <unk> a life and <unk> a lot of times, they were <unk>, only after <unk> a <unk>, they were <unk>, only after <unk>, they were <unk>, only after <unk> a <unk>.
So, I went to <unk> a couple of when the <unk> were gone, and I said, "I need a couple of <unk>, this is my <unk>."
The <unk> said, "You know, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>?"
You want them to <unk> or <unk>? "
"Do them want to <unk>?"
"<unk> <unk> or <unk>? <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
I was <unk>, and after a little bit of a <unk>, I could say, "I want the only guy that was the only guy." He didn't know what it was, so for a time. I <unk> all the <unk> <unk>, then <unk>, and then <unk> out of the store, <unk>, and then <unk> out of the <unk>, I had ever had.
It was <unk>. With all that choice I had <unk> the best.
But I'm worse.
Why? I wrote a book for <unk>.
The reason I was worse is that with all my <unk> were <unk>, the <unk> <unk> to be <unk>, the <unk> <unk> to be <unk>.
At the beginning I had <unk>. I didn't <unk> anything about <unk> when I just had a guy, but when I <unk> 100 different, <unk>, at least one kind of had to be perfect.
What I had <unk> was good, but not perfect.
After I <unk> that I <unk> with what I was <unk> in <unk>.
The <unk> of <unk> in life of people don't do <unk> the <unk> that these <unk> to the <unk> of the same.
And this <unk> <unk>, even when the results are good.
<unk> in the world of <unk> if it realize.
Because if I <unk> it, I don't know what I'm talking about.
The truth is more to this.
"It was better when you were worse worse," The reason why he was was <unk> when you were worse was that when you were worse was <unk> as you can get worse than the <unk> <unk>.
<unk>, in the world that we live -- <unk>, <unk> citizens with the <unk> of <unk> -- the <unk> that we can <unk> is that things are at the <unk>.
You never <unk> because your <unk>, my <unk>, my <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
The <unk> of happiness -- what you're here -- is, "<unk> <unk>" Yes, you want to do it. "
I mean -- a little <unk> moment -- that I'm really <unk> and my wife is really <unk>.
I couldn't do better, I didn't <unk> me.
But <unk> doesn't always <unk> a <unk>.
<unk>, a <unk> of a <unk> <unk> when you have a couple of <unk> when you're not <unk>, and you'll <unk> it. "Why?"
"Who is <unk>?" "" The answer is <unk>.
The world is <unk>. What I could do I do?
When you have hundreds of kinds of <unk>, and you <unk> a <unk>, and you'll <unk> you who is the <unk>, it's <unk> <unk> that the <unk> you are.
I could do better.
With hundreds of <unk> available, there are no <unk> for <unk>.
So when people are making decisions, even though the result is <unk>, they <unk> and give them the <unk> to them.
In the last few years, the <unk> is <unk> in the <unk> world.
I think a <unk> <unk> -- not the only, but <unk> -- of this <unk> of <unk> is just that people have <unk> experiences because the standard are too much <unk>.
And when they have to <unk> this situation think that <unk> is them.
So the final result is that we're better, we're better, <unk>, but we <unk> worse.
Let me show you.
This is the <unk> <unk>, what we all do for good and it's completely <unk>. It's not true.
There is no <unk> that a little bit of choice is better than <unk> at all, but by this doesn't <unk> that much choice is better than a little bit.
There's a <unk>, <unk>. I don't know what it is.
But I'm sure we've <unk> from a piece of the level where the choices <unk> our life.
Now, from the point of view <unk> -- I almost finished -- from the point of view, the <unk> is the <unk>.
What it allows this choice to society in <unk> is <unk> material.
There are a lot of places in the world, and you know, <unk> <unk>, where the problem is not that they have <unk> choice.
The problem is that they have too much <unk>.
So the <unk> I'm talking about is a <unk> <unk> of <unk>, <unk> society.
And what it's <unk> and <unk> is this: <unk> <unk> has talked about yesterday about how those <unk> and <unk> to <unk> <unk> are <unk>. It's a <unk> of money.
I mean that these choices, <unk> and <unk>, it's not that they're just <unk>.
I'm <unk> <unk>.
They're worse.
If a little bit of what in our society allows choice to be <unk> in the people have too few possibilities, it would not be their life to <unk>, but our <unk>.
This is what <unk> call.
A <unk> of income is good at all -- not only the poor -- because of this choice in <unk> that we <unk>.
And to <unk>: "<unk>, you can become everything you want to --
<unk>, people of culture, <unk>, "What's going to do that fish?"
"It's <unk> you can't do anything in a glass <unk>."
"A <unk> imagination, a <unk> vision of the world --
and I <unk> it so, I <unk> it.
But then, I realized that that fish knows.
Because the reality is that if you <unk> in <unk>, in <unk>, so that, "everything is possible." You don't <unk> the freedom.
If you <unk> the <unk> so that it would <unk> to <unk>.
<unk> the <unk>, and <unk> the <unk>.
Everybody needs a <unk>.
This is almost certainly too <unk>, maybe even for the fish, and certainly for us.
But the <unk> of some <unk> <unk> is a <unk> for <unk> and, <unk>, for <unk>.
Thank you so much heart.
