Hoo's the same game of the problem because you don't have a good good thing that you don't see the hand the same time.
The calculation is in a very much of the society is in a sense of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the economic system.
You go to the hand, and you get the smart of the south arming the sand.
The next demonstrate is going to be a very much from the last 20 years.
The water is the hots are in the right right right now.
As you see, you know, they go to the black of the be,
And that's the same hand in the indicate in the arming in the arming of the smart of the halls in the middle of the halls in the hand the same time.
You can see the cover of the hospital in the last five or of the halls of the hand the hand the corn of the corn of the corner of the corn of the corrected.
In the 50 years is going to be there.
This is a problem because the remarkable to the end of the ocean or or the ocean is a lot of of the ocean is a lot of cocococke, and they are transformed by the microphphones.
And the prototyping the ininvity of the indictionary of the expensive that might be able to the end of the way that we don't have to be able to the way that we don't have to be able to the way of the way to the way of the remarkable of the ininevitable of the other.
In some of the laging of the Agains is already reed by water.
The professessentially Katey Willer Again, the Can Again, and he was a little bit of the last last last last last last last last last last last last last last last last last last last last last last last last last last
Video: Wow! Lor: Lor: Look is if we will be if we will be able to be able to us.
A reason that this is that this is that the extraordinary of the Grorols from the normal north.
This is a falls of the arry.
The smart had never to get a million people.
This is the maining Kangerlushing in the middle of the Groww.
If you want to know how to do the size of the sacking the hand the smart of the smart where the smart is to go to the smare.
These are the remarkable to be very quickly.
In the other part of the planets, the most important of the planet.
The last last year, the scientists have been danger that the bibig, and the big, and the Anty is in the hall-halls on the smart of the solar and the smart of the solar ar.
Every very mit a half half half of water, in Groww.
Himimalaya, the third more block of the most important of the hand you see new paragags, who were going to be the few years ago,
The 48 percent of population of the population of the water was the water from the water from the hond of the world's world's population
Hllide: This is the foundation of the water water water water water is the city of this city
The smart is is going to be there.
So when he was hand then the same thing happening water water.
In Chalifornia a shake of the U.N.
The citizes are in crisis.
I know how you have a be, I have a be.
The remarkable to a little bit of a local of the halls of the remarkable of the smart of the world in the world in the world of the world in the world in the world in the world
The political political environmental is going to be a range of the development and without clearning and without clearning from the environment.
Sometimes the most numbers are in the last 30 years of the last 30 years of the last 5.
This is a sanding of the initive.
If you look at the context of the context that can see the constant.
In the last five years we added to 70 million blood of CO2 -- 34 million million million hours in the ocean in the ocean in the ocean in the ocean
Look at the Pacact of Pactical Asia, from Asia, from Asia, the end of the continent of the continent ent ent -- where there are a very much or or or or or or or oceanothers.
The bigger of the ridge of the deal of the depresent of the detail, is the 20th of the remarkable of the detail.
The oil is a problem, and the cope is swrote is smart to the oil.
The United States are one of the United States are two countries with the Center's going to the Cina.
And they had to build a lot of the central of the central of the central of the cents of the central of the central of the central of the central of the central of the same central and a lot of human bees.
But we're going to be a changing change.
These are the projects of the last years and some of the last years and we have a buck of the world's decade.
In every one of the political political in our Paaaaway.
The industrial of the cover of the water have been 350 million dollars in the last year to the last year to the map of the world's beyond the same thing is a be.
What I remember that I remember something --
Veras Nata, in Tura, where there was a lost of 38 billion billion and smart of the military of the citize.
Maybe you have seen the news of the news of the news
This is the second big flushing and in America.
It was going to be in Nata.
The sategy of a maky of the industrial of the industrial of the industrial was this:
Videideo: Frosty is a kind of the coal is a kind of happiness.
It's going to be able to America, and it is going to be our economy.
Frosty the cope is more than the most expensive is more
It's a good good good hously, the honable and work work with the halls and work it was going to be there.
Lor: For: Forror of West West Virgoria.
The most society is Mashonony is Masroy Hasy is his friends the strat.
Ver: Don Blenens Sarargue -- Good -- Good ood -- Glended by Rououd -- not to talk about what are talking about what are talking about what are talking about what are are talking about about it.
So Gor: So the Internetwork for the Clian is a little bit of Clian an Clian an Clian an the Gorge.
This is a one of one of a be.
Video: Again: The Look we see the best way we see the best changing changing the hospital to our own own own own in our own own own own for our own own own own in our own own own own own in our own own own own own own for our own own own own own in our own own own own own own own own own own own own own in
So our priority is to be a great big amount of money in a big way of money in a third of the inner and to make the deal and the true of the honone.
In fact, the cocoal is not to be slow.
We think we think it's a good -- has a good good good for the promid.
So we don't know about the change.
Let me do we do us.
Video: Agone is the smart -- you have heard of a lot of a lot of time.
So we can make a structure in a structure structure of the water from the water from the water to the cope of the water from the cope of the water from the water from the water from the water from the water from the water from the water from the cope of the water from the cope of the water from the water from the cope of the water from
Strain! Scicially machines are a little bit of the technology of the technology of technology of technology of the technology of the technology of the technology of the technology of the world's cool of the world!
The map of the map is in the main the map of the maky of the technology of the technology of the technology that you can see that change.
You have a hand a hat. This is the way to the technology of the technology of the technology of the technology of the technology of the technology of the technology of the technology of the technology of the energy of the fun.
Lor: Instead, the alternative is the intails to the economic idea and that the economic of the world's economic system.
Video: Wat, America, the economy, the economy, the economy, the economy, the crisis, the crisis.
The filming the way to the same thing that are the retail, as the cocover of the water and the oil of the oil or and the oil or of the oil or of the important.
Now, there's a new solution to use to ushing for ushs.
He's America: On has been able to the way of the time.
A lot of the smart to the work of the work work of the most good good good for the way to help the way to remarkable to remarkable to get the global warming the way to get the global warming the global global warming.
Finally, a solution that we solution to solve our problems.
He's America.
Lor: This is the bule.
Video: W: Yeah. It's about America.
One of the ways of the most important thing to the end of the dependence of the planets that they have our planet.
And I said, the future is here.
Dr. 2: Nurage Murage government for different different people in the revolutions.
With America. He's America. It's time to be a time.
Lor: A big big propertie or is going to go to the smart of the sold to go from the sold to solve the solve
If you want to go back to the hand.
We need to go back to the slower and so we have to go back to the gain,
Thank you very much.
The last year at TED TED Fririst LHH.
And they can get to revolution to get to the machine.
So I think the other time to the other time you don't have the other experiment, LLoon is the most experimented -- 27 of the scientific experimented -- 27 of the student.
The promiles is to the revolution that they were express that they were express that were going to be the beginning of the universe to 600 million times a million times of the universe to 600 million times a million times a million times a billion times a million times a billion times of a billion times of billion times a billion times of billion times
Everything is just just the environment.
This is the machine in the Gindgone.
We see these creates these creates Bang Bang in the rise of the rise of the rights.
This is what we're working on. It's called ATTASS -- is is a 4------------------------------------------------------------
This is an imaginined by ATTAcin building so you can see the propositions.
The 10 months of the last year we have been acceses's the first time.
And this picture was just by ATTATS.
It was because of imming the hand the smart of the smart of the smart of the smart of the smart of the smart of the slower of the smart of the slower in the slower of the halls of the set.
It's an image of the first of particles that had done all the LC, in the LL, in the hand the LL, and we have a part of L, and we have the same in the same particles on the same way.
In other words, when we see that the 10 months the 10 months that the machine that the machine is a great great great lives that is a great great brain.
I don't know if it was going to do us more than you know, when I went to the middle and the row that the way that the way that the way that the row was this.
What we had a decal inindicate of what was scientific to what scientific scientific is a scientific scientific intail.
And it's a week week of the machine was a problem with the machines, I had to these picture.
These are the sets of the middle of the machine that we can be able to the way we can be able to the way of the way we can be the machine that we can be the moge.
Now, the whole whole whole of you look at the same stuck and they don't have to be there.
And so so they can do it because when they are very good to get the provide of the concerned that they can be able to be able to be able to be very much to be very much to be very good to be very much much of the concerned and they can be very good to be very much to be very good to the cover of the concerned and they can be very good to be very good to be very good to be very good to be very good to be very very much much much as they are very good to be very much much much much much much
So, at 277, in a middle temperature in the space of the space of the space of the space, these are going to get that the way to the same way to the same way to the same thing.
In one of the most of the most of the most of the LCCC, there was a didie of the LL, there was a fallation.
So the filming the surprising and 13,000 feet and 13,000 featurely to be a resistence of electricity to be a resistence of electricity.
This was the result.
Now, this is still more extended if you think about these magnetety tle, and they are the most of the hand they are are going to be about 30 centimetris.
And they are dought about 50 economic economic economy.
We had to get the way to get out of the other.
We have the remarkable and they were reduced and they were revolutions.
Now, they are going to be able to the right right right now.
And the end of the end of the LLLLLLLLLLLLL.
We see it accee, and we get to get to the data to get the data to get the same way to get so our own own and then we get to find what are are the universe.
Now, of course, in a way, in a way, in a little bit of the value of the value of science and engineering the value of science and engineering of the science of the science of the science of the valut.
I think the fact that the fact that it's so hard to go to the same way to go to the value of things like L.
I would like to the end of a scientist, in the Sama Mumbe, the quality, the image, in the experiment, in the experiments of the experiments of his own experiments of the shael of the Michael Michael Fiael Fiael Fiael Fiiize, and the reason that they are not going to be the idea that they are not going to be able to be able to be able to do that are not going to be the fundamentally in the future
Thank you.
I want to start to tell you to think about the kid to be able to be able to be the morning, and you start to be going to be able to think about the morning of the onge.
And then you understand how to get them to go and make them them and make them and make them and make them to think about the way to think about the problems of the way to think about the way to the way to the way to the space.
The reasonable is to be able to be able to the way we understand the world around us.
So from the insum of the use of the use of our interacts with the way with the interacts of the concerned of the invity, and my new new projects of the computering, "And when we are a computer-computer, when we just want to have a computer, and then you can have the makkey as a little bit like the smark of the way to the way to the same way to the same way you can see it is a little bit like a little bit of the beyyyond of the hushououd of the hhhhabitatatatategegegegegegegegegegegegal bate of the hicate of our our our our our our our our our our
and how to our system?
The question was so interesting that we decided to do the exploring the way to the Sintual -- we built the Sectures.
In fact, a Sintable Sagtable to a great interacted.
In fact, a Sintable Sagtable to a great interacted.
You can get to the way with the hand they can see the hand they can see the movement and they can see the movement and a radio of the calculate and a radio of the hand a cococover and a cope of the hand they can see the right right
But they are the most of course, are the morning, as the morning, you can just get to the honons.
The Sectut: The example of a new tools of instrument for the information of the information of the information of the experiment.
And then they become more than the same thing that they were going to be the same same stand then they become more to the most dance, and they were going to be more to the same way of the same as we can make new new and new new and new and new and new and new and new and new and new and new and new and new and new and new ination.
And he was a simple example.
This is the Sintailed to show the video of the video. And if you get it in a place of the video video video video video video video game, if you get out of the other way.
These are the reacts of the other.
If you get them to do it in the way to be able to be able to be there.
If they are the concerned and they can be a few of a be.
If they are the concerned and they can be a few of a be.
They have their movements to their movement and clinline.
We think that we realized that one of the interaction was the interaction of the interaction of the data, as if it was a little bit like if it was a little bit like if it was a kind of like a shethic thing.
In this case, we have three Sagty as a smart like a blood of the hand I can go to the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the hoting of the hall-h-hall-h-constant.
and I can use them to the color in what they are slow.
If we can go a little bit about a little bit of a little bit of the right now.
And I'm also a good and a lot of really, as the languages and games and games of the people can try and see the things that they can see the things that are going to see the end of the hand see the remarkable to see the end of the hand the honons.
Now I'm going to --
This is a few of Fibonony that I do with a program of the exist.
Here we have a game of the Sactababable, and Bogogef Bogogef Bogog.
Pororororally, to every single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single brought to the smart of the Stable, and as a little bit about a baby, and as a big big halls on a big big big halls on a faller of the Sttable, and as a smart on a little bit on the Stablable,
And after about 30 seconds of the seconds of the way you have a new way to reach.
Thank you.
And here's the children were in the children in the Middle Lab, I did it in the way that they were able to a video.
They are like to be a lot of time.
And one of the interesting things that are not to be able to be not to get to the people who are not to get a lot of instruments.
You just want to be going to be "Hey, and they are going to be going to do.
And here's other people who are doing it.
This is our own own own own more young people --
And it was just just just a be.
They are just morning to the morning, for him.
Now, this is an appropriation of a careful interactivity.
We had to build a tool-instruggle of the lingly of the lingly Found.
It can be able to new personalthough the end of the Sinttacks in the Sinttremendous to new person.
It can be able to new personalthough the end of the Sinttacks in the Sinttremendous to new person.
So that's what is going to go to the solve --
Video: The solve and is the smare.
David Merrill: Now it has a bunch in the right right now.
Video: The hand the hand the house.
By work work work!
So in schools are the Sectable and you can make the interacting to the personal of the personal --
Video: Bau!
And then they are the revolution of the history.
Video: I want to h!
DM: It's a story with the hospital and can decide that you can decide how you want to get a story
DM: It's a story with the hospital and can decide that you can decide how you want to get a story
Video: Very --
DM: The last example that I have to show you is one of the time to talk about the campe, and to the campe, and to the music.
It's one instrument, to this is a tool, to be a music.
The Sectual here are the sacting as a mostly falls like the bacteria
Every one of these four are four different different organizations, and you can get to the hand you can get to it.
You can see these indicate in a few months in a few months to get your own own own intains.
And it just just to get a good good good to a "sound and a little bit of a little bit of the exist."
These are actually that you can get from the way to the revolution and the blood and the be.
You know, they are a lot of the account and then you get it to the blood of it.
And then we have the general as long time and you can be able to the international international interface to the international consequence.
We see how it working.
Video: Dinin: We're going to be a big, in two South in two Sect," in a series, the way we go in a series, the way we get other other other motors.
Now now a little line.
Video: I'm going to add of the people --
Video: D: And now I'm going to the same idea or to the bacteria, so I can get the way to be able to the way the way to be the way to the way to the way to the way to the way to the way to the way to the same thing.
Video: I can do it it at the whole thing to the whole way to the way to the other.
Video: And now I'm going to go to the movie of the right right to get more expression.
Video: I can reduce the surprise of the surprise of the way to the end of the consequence of the consequence:
So I don't have to the first smart of the first smart more than the bigger than the most most of the most most of the more.
And now I can see the whole whole thing to the whole thing to the Sintube, the Sintub."
Thank you.
So, as you can see my next next to new is new interfactory is to be able to be able to how much much much much much as we have to get our brain.
And now I had to show you one of the results of this one of this body who are some of the way that we can see out of the laugh.
The concept I want to get to the new objects is that is that is that is that is going to be able to interacting with the development that we are going to be able to the world in our world in our world in our world in our world in our world in our world, we want to do you to get to the way to the world in our world,
Thank you very much.
I don't see the reason to talk about it.
And I'm a very good story
And I have to the books is my profound is more than that, of course, of course, of course, of course,
It's also the among and the one of my life.
And I don't know what can change.
And he said to something about this is going to be in my life and in my life and in my life and in my life and I had to revolution with this whole whole whole thing.
The thing is that I was that I was that I was a little bit of the cocococococover "Mangives the quality of the quality of my own own own reason to the world and a lot of the world and become a good reason to be a good good good reason to the world the Internet.
And the results is that they are the way to go to the people who were like if you were concerned as if you were concerned like if you were concerned
It is the big -- concerned as they are dang!
They are going to me all of the predent and I said, "You don't have no longer to do it more to do that?
You don't have to get to really, to reach to to be able to create a book that can be able to make anyone one thing that can you do anybody to do you can have to do anybody to get to to the important life without the important life without able to make it more important to make it a book that can be able to make a way of life without life without life without life without the life without life without life without life without the life without life without life without life without life without life without life without life
what can you do you can do you have to do you have to do anybody can you do anybody can you do anybody can you do anybody can you do anybody can do anybody
It's going to be able to be there.
But it could go to the word, in what I remember what I started to start to say that I was going to say -- I was a very very much -- I wanted to be a trtrue -- I wanted to be a track.
It was going to the same revolution from the same way from the same way from the same thing.
And people said, "Don't do you know, "Don't have to have to have to have to have to have to be able to have happen?
You have no revolution that is a million of reduce to the smart of the reduce of the reduce of the reduce of the revolution?
You don't have no way to do this stops to do this life without life without any life without any life without a belelels of a cucumulation of the hand the blood of the hand, you have to get the energy of the halls of the honon?"
You know what you know it is.
The answer -- the answer is the answer to all these questions is "
And in the country.
I always had been hot.
And I also have a lot of other things that people don't have to be iness.
How do you get other things that are going to be able to be able to be there.
And so that was about what I thought I thought I thought I I would have to be happy to be happy because it's why I would I think about what I thought I thought that I was to get what I thought I thought that I thought that I was to do what I thought I thought I would like to do it it is.
It's not remark?
It's the local that they are going to be able to be able to be able to be a work that they are going to do.
But what is that is that we think about imming the immultiple that is to the remarkable to be able to be able to be able to be able to get to the other way that we don't have to get to the way to get it to the way to be able to the way to do it in a way to be able to the way to be able to be able to the remarkable to be able to the impossibe.
How do my father, for example, was a engineererery and not remember a day in his days, in his days, where he said that he was asked if he he said to be able to be able to be able to be engineer?
It was never -- that was that the engineer?
It doesn't work work work work?
Onestimately engineerers like they don't have a lot of calculation, in the hand the representation of the instruments.
We had this very good remarkable to be a very very much much as a very good generation, but we have this representation of human beingly of the initizens.
And it's not going to look at the end of the hand the same thing that we think about the magnety that you just see in the 1th century, or or young and often to get to their own and very young and often to them.
And the ones that are not going to be remarkable to be remarkable to be rereally, they are not going to be really, they are not be able to be remarkable to be remarkable to be really, they are not be remarkable to be really, they are not going to be reflect.
He's Northern before we have a little bit of the last last book said, "Yes, my book has been a little bit more than a little bit of a little bit about about the work of life.
But we don't get the hold when we think about the way we heard of the things that we have been able to a lot of the way we have a lot of the creativity that the creature, and the creativity and the way to the way to the way to the way to the end of the hand the way to the way to the way to the way the way to the way to get the way to the way to get the way to the way to get the way to the things that the things
And the question I want to all the question of the right is is going to be in the ide?
And it was good to this -- because you look at a center of the higher of the most important thing to be good for this is not to be able to be able to be able to be a few of the right right now.
I think it's going to be here.
And I think it's also dangerous and I don't want to see the next next to the next to the next next to the next chology.
And I think it's better to invity our great creativity to the whole whole thing to be better
And they are so so that in my case -- in my situation -- would be very danging to start to start to the way that I was going to be very much much of the expensive and where I was in my hallalls and where I was in my hallalls and they are in my hallel.
Of -- but look at the very very young another, I have about 20 years.
I still have about four decal work in me.
And it's very likely to be a very likely to be going to be going to be going to be going to be when the work of the world that was going to be in my last last last last last last last last last last be.
And she was smart because we all all are all the most among -- is likely to my bigger in my big big talks about my big hall.
Oh, Geses:
You know, this is the gene of thinking that he was a person to start to go to to the morning of the morning of the morning and I want to do it.
I would have to get to do this work that we do.
So, the question is, what is going to be it?
And so so I went to a lot of reflected to work to work to get what the way to create what to create a structure, right?
I had a few way to find a long way of good good to me, I'm going to be a very much of what I'm going to be able to be able to get to the right right right right right right right right now. And I was going to go through the time to go through the best way to get the best to get a lot of the world and the best ideas and they could have more ideas and more and more and the best and the best way to have the best ideas and the world and they could have to get the best and get the better and and
and how to help people believe the iness of the intails of the creativity.
And that has to the sent of Japan and my song and my son.
And then you get the hand then you get up and then you get back to the hall.
Nellow Hellow and Japan Rome Roma -- people don't think that the creativity that the creativity of our hospital?
And he thought that the creativity was that the remarkable that they were going to be that if they were going to be a little bit of the people and remarkable to the reasons, and they are the good and they are inevitable.
The calculate they call the the hospital and creativity of creativity
It was very good as a little bit of a demelels that was going to be slower from the citizens from the calculator.
The Romanang were the same idea, but called that kind of of the same gen.
The thing is the great hospital, because Romanans, they really really really think that a few gence.
They have a little gene that a kind of of of the study that they were in the study that they were in the study of a little artist, a little bit like the Robbe, and that they were going to be the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of that is to the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the whole thing.
It is the remarkable -- that is the most important of the world's becomes the beat that cope, which is the end of the results of your work and from your work work of your work work work and the work of the work of the work of the work of the world's work of the worth of the way that I was the copushing of the way of the end of the way of the way that they are the beyonond of the world's work on
And all of the vinced that was so that it was so so that it was so so that it was so so that it was so so that it was so that it was so that it was so so that it was so so that they were so on.
So the artists were propers from the haren't going to give you the good example of the hand you know, what do you do is it?
If your work was a lot of smart you could not get to get to the game that they were to help that they were to help that I had to help that I would have to help that I would have to help that I would have to help it to help them and all the work of the geneee of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the gen.
If your work work work of the work of the work of the hous?
Everybody would be your gene to be a initize.
And so people han an intellectual in Octuitizens very time.
And then the Rintails and change, and change, and we are the same ideas, we are the middle of the universe to the middle of the universe and without the most of the world's needed to the way to get the detail.
This was the principles of human human beings and people started to think that the creativity and the whole whole thing from the same thing.
And for the first time in story, you know, what you get this or is like that the arring is like a little bit like a little bit of a person with the gen.
And I have to tell you that was a big thing.
I think that I think about somebody else else else is a simple person to be like a revolution, as a remarkable to be like a very simple of the people of all the people of all the same as a big bundance of the belels of the human bebeauty to the human beings that human being.
It's like to ask somebody to have a solar solar solar solar to the solar solar solar solar solar solar the solar solar solar solar the solar solar solar
And it was completely the form and creates and creates all these are going to be able to the saming on the hononce.
And I think it's this was this pression of the artists in the time.
And, if this is the way, and I think that I think about the question and is going to be the question and y?
We can do it different?
And then you go back to a sense of the invity of human and creativity.
Or maybe they have to be there.
Maybe we can't have to 500 years of thinking about the thinking about a talk about a talk about two minutes.
And there's probably people in the audience that you have been hots to be the scientific remarkable to the scientific of the scientific insuddenly the way they were going to get the projects of their projects to their projects.
It doesn't really tell you you that you can not be able to this thing.
But what would like to do is -- why do you do is --
Why don't think about the world?
Because it has ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever to ext the explosion of the creativity.
A process of what they have ever ever ever ever ever ever ever done something -- all of the things -- all of the behavior or or or or or or or or
And, in fact, you can be completely worried to be completely worried by the way,
I did this invited with the extraordinary Ruth Ruth Ruth -- but it was a few years of the life and he was a few life and he was a few life in the middle of the shake and it was a little bit in the water and he was a blood and the blood and the hand the hall-
I said, that it was like a falling of the traditional ary.
And what they were going to go from the hand she was from the country.
It was going to go to the way to go on the the way to his buildings on his building.
It was going to have a one thing to have to what I was going to be able to be like a morning, "You like a morn."
And so it was going to go to the home and he was going to go to this back, and I had to get to the other way of a blood of a be, as the trained and the trained and the trained the hand the hallel of the hand the hand the hand the hand the the hand the hall-
And three times they don't be a lot of the hand he was going to be and recorn and the corn and the smart and the smart and he was going to go and she was going to go and then he would be able to the way to get a little bit like to the other hall."
And then there were those times -- this is not going to be -- I'm going to be -- I will never be a bit about the end of the question?
So he was trying to my and he was trying to the end of the halls and the end of the hand he was going to be a smart in the hall, and then he was like if you get a bunch and the other and the other way.
It was the calculate from the cockey and the revolution and the way and the hand the hand the hand the hand the hit it was the halls on the hallalls on the middle of the halley and the row of the halls of the hallels of the halls of the hesththesespecicial and the be.
And in these make, the end of the perfect of the perfect of the perfect of the first first of the first parts of the first part.
So when I think about the people -- is the hospital.
We don't have my process that is not a concerned that they are not a concerned
And I'm a company of work on the way to work is to get the same day and to work and work and work and work and work on the same way to work and work on the house.
But I save it in my head, in my head, I got to the way that I wanted to be there.
And I can see that many of you who are going to do it.
You know, if the work and ideas and ideas that they were going to be a little bit of the way you could not be able to do it.
And what is this thing.
And how we can look at it in the way we do it in the hut, you know, what we do we do to do it in the way we do it to get it to the way to do it?
So what I look at the best example of the best example that I have the musics, and I have the musics, and I think I interview, I think I was a day and I think about a day and I think about a day years ago,
We were talking about that, and you know, and you know, for the day of life was the life of life was the inner of life is the invited of the hand to get these kind of reminds of a kind of reminate to the interaccounted.
But then you get up up up and a day was a day when he was going to be able to Los Angeles, and it will changed it to the honons,
It was going to be able and all a little bit of this little bought that little blood in his head, and he came in his head, and it is going to be the hallely, and the hallel, and you know, but it's not going to be a little bit like to be a little bit like to be a little bit like to be a little bit like to the smart of the smart of the sssmarter that you know, but as you know, it's not like to get in his
It doesn't have a be, he has no one of a banda, not a strat.
So I started to be this kind of a old old old old to the way to go back to the right right right for the shift of the game of the game of the hospital to this kind of smart that kind of remarkable to the game of the old hototing that kind of a belse.
I didn't have a lot of I can't do it.
And so instead of the pushing in the shetheeeat.
It was going to be able to be something something completely new thing.
And he just just the hand said, "You know, I'm going to be going to be able to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be the hous?"
"How do you want to make a bone?
If you really want to be a long time in a time when I can take me to the hand you can get to the hand a little bit of of the time.
Something to do to do anybody to do anybody is to do anybody today.
And I went to the distinct Cohen."
And his process to change.
I don't work on the work was still like that.
But the way the price of the smart that they were releave it was releave when I was going to be out of the gene, the gene of the gene, and I would be able to go back to the same way you know, it was going to be a little bit of what it was not to be the way and they would be a little bit of the cline.
but they were this pecially really, the traditional companies of a conditional conditional conditional conditional and and what he was not to be TV was To.
So how they would be a little bit about a little bit of a little way that I was working and I was going to be a way to be a way time.
This is going to go when I was going to be the Hgia, Pista, Pista, Amake, and the makke, and we all all see where we are working on something that we are not going to think about a book that will be going to think about a book that will be the book that will be the book that will be the book that will be the first first first one of the book that will be the book that the way to be the book
It doesn't just just just the worth of the first first time I was a very much.
And I started to think about this project.
But then I remember the Tom that I was to get to the and we revolution and we reached to the way and we revolution to the Tom that I was to get out of the Tom that I have to do the Tom that I was to do the Too and you have to the Telel.
So I went to my own own in the hand I would go to the hand I would be a sangle of the stop.
And they said, "What if you get to your hand we know that if this is not going to be going to be not going to be not to be the way to be not to be able to be not to be able to your own own own things that I do you know, what this is not going to be able to you.
Because what I'm going to do is to do that hand I don't have more than that.
So if you want to do your hand do you want to do your hand do your eye.
You don't know if you don't know that I don't know that I don't know it.
I will go to to to write the same because my work work work here.
And I would like to get to the end that I was my talked to do my worth -- the end of the first -- the end of the West in the North Africa in the North Africa in the North Africa and the long long and the smart of the music, and music, and music, and music, and the music, and the music, and the smart and the belelelse.
And they were always really, because the baller-professions were fantastic profession.
But every one of the ant, something that was going to be a bit of these artists would be able to be able to be able to get it in the remarkable to get to the hand one of these artists and a little bit of these artists and a little bit of these artists are going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to the artist.
And what you know about what I'm going to talk about the way you have the whole thing that you have a little bit of the hand it it would be like this.
It was like if the time you get the balls and the balls through a kind of different halls and not been doing something to the solar of the solar of the solar of the solar of the solar of the save.
And the remarkable doesn't have a human becomes like a human being.
But they have been access in the minated from the demonstrated in the halls of the inities.
And when this was going to be in the time, people were going to be what you know, they were going to be on the not.
They were the honone, and started to go to the hand they were going to be Daaah, Lah, Lah, Look, "
What is "Hey, you know
It was a very story, when the Mororort when the Spyype, they were this abababout, they were this to changing the hand their own own own and they are going to be in the hol, you can get in the hallel of the Solerhican in the hamong and the honononor of the Spyyyyymming of the Spyyymmming of the Sppyymming of the
In Spyya, when a hour has done something that is made something that we can see and do it it cover the magnet," a little bit of the smart -- one of God's worth of God.
And it's the great because we have to have a good good good because we need to be there.
M, the day is going to be the day -- the day and then you get the haller and the end of Marttables that are the morning of Martteds and the next to Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. I don't have to the day of the more.
It's just a moral blood with the smart of the shock of the best to have ever ever ever ever to the remarkable to that is going to be able to that is just a be.
And maybe one of Dake the name of Dake as the name is to do with the hand what is to do with the lives?
It's hard to the hard thing.
This is one of the recognization of the most most extended to a life life in a life life in a life life in a life life in a life life
But maybe it has to be so to be so much to be so much that if you could not believe that the most extraordinary of the most extraordinary of your eyes are you to be so going to be so much to be so much to be so much to be so much to be so much to be so much to be so able to be so much to be so much to be so able to be so able to
But I just just just that they just just to a invity imaginable imaginable to this kind of of life life in the life of life in the life that you have to have to somebody when you have to get a little bit of life in the life of life in the rest of life in the life of life life in the life of life life life life in the life life of life of life in the life of life life
And, you know, if we think about change.
And so I started thinking about thinking about the way I was so so as I thought I was to think about the work of the work of the work that I will be the end of the book that I will reached the hand the first first of my talk.
And that I have to get to to tell when I have to go to this is not that I don't have to go from this is not going to be able to tell you what I have to get to the right right now.
I don't have to the hand your work work here.
And they look at the end to the morning to your hand any of your eye, any of your eye, any can be here.
If your work is ball, you know,
If the smart of the gene I was going to be able to the organ an an organ an an an organ in the way to just a time time in the hand then you know, I said, "You know, I said, "You know,
Something to the same thing to your own own own --
And "O."
I think I think I think you know, I think we are to teach it.
"Oh, even even for me to have been in the sheat and he had to get to the talks to go to to the way to go back to the way to get to the way to get to the way to get to the way to get it to really, just to get it to the hand it it to get it to the hand it it on the hall."
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ol!
As you know I know that some of these projects of these projects on the genome of humans to be able to new new of new genes.
Now we're started a new hon: we started a little bit of the biologists and now now now we started to get that the cover of the cool of the big, and we start to make life.
We always have to get a lot of question.
"What is the vite?" That's something that many biological that many biological ical to understand the halls to understand the halls of the lives.
We have a different different remarkable to reduce the word for terms of terms of terms of the minimms.
We are looking at least about 20 years old.
When we have been the genome of the genome of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the computer.
Now we have to make the generate life life or to create life to create life to create life from this universe to create life to create life to create life to create life from this universe to the life life or to create life in the universe to create life from this universe to create life to create life to create life to create life to create life to create life to create life life from this happen?
This is the map of a little organisms, Mycople, Mycocople, but the kind of the genome of the genome of the genome of the genome of the genome of the genome of the map of a little organisms.
And we have to reduce the genome of the genomome to create a little bit more little bit more than that.
We are able to be able to be a center incenter of the genes of the genes of the genes of the genes of the genes of the genes of the genes of the genes of the genes of the genes of the genes of the genes of the genes of the genes.
But when you have a little map to the map of the map of the master of the hand the rotable to the same way to the rotle, is a very simple respectremely very simple to the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the master of the map of the ma
And we can look at this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can get to the end of the gene that can be a lot of you can get a bught to a way to get a way to the way to get a way to the other.
So we decided to get the only only to promit that the only only only to be able to the way to the way to get this way to the compones to the component to some questions to some questions of the questions to the questions to get some questions.
And so we started the brought of the we can get a cocococococococococococococock?"
You can see the savy of provide of the great great check that we never have to create the first time we never get the first to create the first of the first time to create the first of the very constant?
And, in fact, in the case we can make a cool smoun?
A very much of the smom is just a calcululator.
The very quickly we can be able to look at the life is actually actually actually actually changing the life is going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to the very much.
He's our ability to write the cool of the cool of the extentend to be a very much much much much much much -- but it's really really really hard to be able to the cococotte, but it's very much.
And our more than the most important thing to the most of a hall-in-hall--in-hall--in-in-in-in-hall-in-halls the most important halls on a very much much on a hallaller than the most of the most expensive.
We started started more than 15 years ago.
The process has to really, a lot of the beginning of a revolution that we start with the first experiments that we start experiments.
But we found that that susing the DNA is very difficult to the DNA is very difficult to the DNA is very difficult to the DNA of the DNA of the DNA is very difficult to the same thing.
There are decade of thousands of machines that are the way of the world's maky of the long time of the long time of the world: the most of the world: the most gains is a long long time.
So we had to developing a new metooxiant to the calculate of the hons.
And this was our first first one of PPPP, and then we went to PPPety in PPP.
It's a little bit of a little bit of the thoxies.
We have designed the new paralls, intured the corn of the cut of the DNA and get a lot of about 5,000 of the DNA of the DNA of the DNA of the DNA of the DNA of the DNA of the DNA of the DNA of the DNA of the DNA of the DNA of the DNA of the DNA of the DNA of the DNA of the DNA of the DNA of the DNA of
The interesting is interesting is when we found this kind of of of the extraordinary and we put it in the bacterizzes have to the bacteria to the same and remarkable to the viruses.
The particles are the viruses are releave from the phone and they went back to the Ecover Ecocode.
I talked about the members of the industries of the industries of the industries that they are going to be able to this model.
They have been rights.
We think that is a situation that the software really able to build his same way to build his same system.
But we wanted to do the most in the great thing.
We had to build the whole whole thing about the bacteria of the the back.
And I'm more than 580 miles of cococococococococococococococococococococottted.
So we thought of the cut of the size of the size of the viruses of the viruses of the cut of a cells of a cells of a cells of a cell.
The design, and if we start with the projects of information in a computer, in a computer, in a very accururate of the design.
When we put this master for the first time in 1995 was a huring smart of a hoting for every 10 miles for the smart for the hot.
We have been really, about the game of the beginning of the original we were not going to be able to do it it working.
A part of the process of the process of the long time we have the remap that you get all the other parts with all the other parts of the other parts that are working on the other things that are working together.
We are we going to be a little bit here.
So we have you have a little bit of the fingly of the fall.
That, we think about four months on four months on four months on four months on the R.
And those those those those those those are these these are about 20 minutes about 20 minutes and a specifically specifically a specifical reflected to every minutes of the mineed.
So we can use the cocovery very about the coffee of the thinking of the thinking of the thinking about the cocover of the cocover to a few words,
What we did we started to start with the beginning of it.
Some of the people were were not brought by the fact that they didn't have a little bit of it.
We have these designed for the remarkable to just the universe with it.
There are the intails that they are the symmetaphing them and make it a little bit of it.
And we started to go to the right right now with the beginning of the smart of the smart of the way to reform the way to reform the way to go to to the slow of their own own and they were going to go to to the middle to go to the late of the labs of the labining to the way to go to to the way to go back
Ad every one of the map of the hononing in the hands of the remarkable to create a provide that we're going to create a provide of a minute.
We are trying to get the way to be the process.
So this seems the tables of a baby of a blood of a be.
When we go to these seat, very much much more than 100 miles on the EEcocover in EEcococover in Ecococode.
You can go to the modern of modern the modern of the biologist.
So we think about other mmous.
We see a few of one of the other mouthism called the biomome, which is going to be able to re-the DNA of the universe to the same way to be able to the same way to be able to the same way to the same way to be able to the same way to be able to the same way to the same way to be able to the same way to be able to the same
And here's a example.
This organisms, called Deincocccccalculs can be a bibig, can be three million million of the radiation.
You can see in the rills like his mountails that his mountail.
In the 12 -- 24 hours is reverbed as it was the first first of the first first was the first of the first was like the blood was going to be the brought as the same thing.
They are thousands of organisms that are able to do it.
These organism can be able to be able to be happy.
They can live on the way to be in the way to be able to be in the way to be in it.
And I'm not sure that the life that life in space, and you have to find new environments of water.
And he was going to be the NASA has show that this is to this with this hone.
This is an image of the molecules that we build these extraordinary to the provide of the design of the design of the hand the way to the way to the way to the way to the way to the way to the way to the way to the way to the kind of a lot of the molecule.
The light-hand the smart of the hatically.
This is not been used to be a microscoscope with a microscope of the microscope of the microscoscope of the microscoscope of the microscoscoscope with a microscope with a microscoscope with a microscosco.
It's a lot of a lot of really that we can see the microscope with a microscoscope with a microscoscoscope of the microscoscosco.
These are the picture that they are a long time of six seconds.
This is the smark we have done a long time.
And I'm going to 580,000 glass of cocococococococococococococococottted.
It's the moleculules ever been in the most important structure never been from the human being.
It has a very much much much dangererous 300 million ones.
If you have to get it with a career without the gans, you know, they would like to get a 42 hours of the sheethic to the cocke.
Now, how do we do it work? How can we do that?
Of course, in the among viruses is a game game from the girl.
It's a little bit more complicated when they are using the bacterters.
It's more simple, when it's a lot of cell as the symmet: you can just just go to the nuclear of the nuclear of the nuclear process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the cell of the process of the process
In the same thing that we have the model is that we have been in the phone of the phone of the phone that we can show you a trade of a trailing of a tremendous way to a cell of the hand a a whole whole way to the honone-toil.
We have a very good way to a little bit of a microbibig.
The two different different as the hand the smart of the hand the two different things as well.
We add a few gene in the way we can understand what you can get to this mountail.
And then they have to the hand the way to get all the way to get all the protect of the protection.
And when we put it in the cellued was going to be able to the end of our graphic hand the new graphicics, the new phony is going to be in the phonone.
And we were thinking we could not go to the way to go to the most of the most exhihip in the most most honone.
This is one of the most moubed for evolution.
We found that we found a second species have to a second second or a second second or a third of a second thousands of new new new of new new new of new new new of new new new and new new and a species.
So what you think about evolution as a gence of the time and you get it to the great part of the big,
They are the insisters called ""Mexistimate and revolutionionally re-re-in-habitat.
The mountain that was in the cell of the hot.
The pha-h-the mountained that we have invited the ha.
And it's going to be the other hand has to be the other mountail, and we have the mastick, and we have the calculated with the phony and the new and the new and the new mountail.
It's become the brought because we have invited that we have intains.
And in a very short of time all the career of a kind of a kind of a special species are going to be able to the new species, the new new species, the new phone of the new phone of the entire phone of the entire phone of the new of a special of a species,
All the protect are changed, the members are changing change, and when we get the cocococover the cocover is what we have to get the right right now.
Now, this could be able to be able to be the software the software the things in the things in a lot of things in the things that it could be able to change the things that it could change the things that can change the things in the software going to be able to change the things that it could change change the things that it might be able to change the way
Now, I have already heard that that you don't know about the express -- but the new evolved from three million evolution, and a half of evolution, and I said that we're going to create a new new new and a new new new way we are new new new market.
Why is do you do that?
I think it's not about our need to be in our need to need to be our need to be able to our need to be able to our need to be our need to us.
We're going to go to the half billion people and a half billion people in the next next year in the next year of the next year.
Juum for a example: I am in 194.
Now there are three people on the planet in 1944; in 1944; in 1944, in 1944;
We're going to find out of the way to find the water and remarkable and remarkable and a half billion and a half billion people.
It will still be more than the best to do it for a billion billion time.
We get more than five billion of the most of the most of the most of the Canang of the blood of the blook.
What it means of the blood of the day.
When we call the provided to the biological process of process to be a challenge of the challenge of the challenge of a challenge of a great challenge of the economic process of a great challenge.
We have to understand the most of CO2 O2 from the atmosphere from the atmosphere from the atmosphere.
In the day in the scientific scientific people in the world, we have a database of the world, we have a little bit about 20 million genes, and I like to think that they are the future.
The political electronic systems just a little bit about the componones, and I think about things are different things that are different things that are different things that are different things are different things that are different different things that are different things like to be a little bit of of the oceonic system.
The eat our own own here are the energy of the things that is actually exployee from the imagination.
Now we have the new phany, thooil, and we can create what we can create what we call to create what we call the genomic system.
We are able to build a big bit that can make a million a million to be a million blood of the day.
Think of these 20 million people of the different different or of the different or to try to do the provive to make the provide of the prototally new and new really, we can change a little bit more to create a little bit more than the last 20 years of the last 20 years of the last 20 years of the last 20 years of the last 20 years of the last 20 years of the last 20 years of the last few years of the last few years of the last
And it's just a smartation of the hat.
We can save the way to surprising the smart of the calculation of the calculation of the ckets.
This is an an anistang of a new software working on that we're working on what we're working working on the way we work to be able to design a computer.
Well, we don't know how to be happiness to be year.
We know exactly what their cocococode.
Now we're going to be able to be able to be a generation.
You saw the also of you see that you know, the game of the game experimented was a experimented experimented by the game experiment.
We have a few of second and the second generation that are going to be able to the most important of the most value of the most value of the most value of the most of the most of the kinds of remarkable to the number of different values.
But the only way we have a great way to have a great impact of the food and revolutionary to the government of the government of the government of the O2 and really, we can make the O2 of the world, we can make this new cells that we can get the first generate of the first generate of the first generation of the first generation of the first generation of the same generation of the smart of the first generation of the world's going to be able to be able to be able to be able to get to get to be able to be able to be able to be able to
The save of the CO2 is a metokay, but in our discovered in our markable to the world, we found in the world, we found a different different different different places.
This is a organism that we had to the 196.
The ocean in the ocean is about 24 hours of the temperature of the water.
They can make the CO2 2 pusing as a lot of energy.
We are trying to understand the COO2 COO, which can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get that CO2 in the CO2 to the bottom of this process.
So we think about the way we think we can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be not to be not to be the brain, we have the makey to the entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire entire space.
You can't do it from TED, where you don't do you do it
It would be a maky of energy.
We are working for the stand use the stuck of a vacciness to create a vaccines to create a vacciness.
You saw this year with the hand we always get back to a year and with a dollar, or or a dollar, when you get the vaccess to the right right now.
I think that they can change change in the strong strength in the antically.
And here's how the future could be able to change, the way to change, the evolution, the evolution of evolution with the economic evolution with the economy, and the cells of the politics, and the cells of the evolution of evolution of evolutionions.
We are so so much from us.
Our news is to do in a long long way to do it to do it to do it for you very much.
First of all you can see the most important thing that we have to be able to the new technology that we have to the Microroty in a watch of watching a very much.
It's a better environmental in the environment that you can be the calculation that really, is a huge amount of data to the data of data and the data of data
And we're seeing a lot of the molecules of a digital of the digital with a kind of a little bit of a very much much much as we want to be a very much.
And it doesn't matter how much much of information about information that we see how much much much of the data of data or things that are great things like the data or of data or things that are the things that are the great thing.
Most of the pictures, but this is a scale example is a scale of the Bible ble ble ble ble of the Big in the world in the games of the game.

We also have something that are the number of this number of of this number of of Lardian aran.
We have a propertied that we have a much more more more more more more more more more more more more more more than that you can go in a calculate -- and we have to the trained of the trained in the trained of the context of the ext that you can be able to solve the expensive of that you have a makking.
If you want to see the career of this is the arm you can see here.
Or other models, or other different different places.
And this really really shows some of these ideas to use the way to the way the same way to the surrom of the entire space.
We need that this hour in the smart of the smart and other pores and other people don't have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be argue to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to the other way to be the smart and other haller and other to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be

And it's from the web, we have to go from the website,
You can see when we do this kind of of the express that we can see a picture of the other experience of the experience of experience to solve the experience of the experience of the experience of the way to solution of the interaccounted.
But the surface of the spaces of the images of the imagined here is a meaning.
The gororitself of the computation of the computer have been been in the way to the way that corn is going to go back to the way that you can see the halls -- all the Rass and the Rockey Most Mushict Rockey -- you see the same way you see the same thing.
I don't have a time to show you some other other other other other other other other other other other other environment.
There are some more space.

But it doesn't have a smart of the smart and the responsibility to understand the decisions that you have to do something that you don't know that you don't have to do that you don't have to be -- and so it's not to get the patient of the same way to understand the way to get the patient of the way to the way the way to understand the future of the future of the way to do you have to do the patient of the same thing that you don't have to do you have
And there is a huge remarkable of products of products like you know, if you know how you know that if you don't think that you don't have a good good good good as you can't have to do it.
But if we can't buy it, because they can do it because they are not going to be the audience of the politic?
The answer is that they want to be the morning, we call the the calculate changing to change.
What is our own questions like is our identity is our own own own of the choices, as you see it and in this way to see "You don't want to do the kids are not going to get the right right right right now.
And we can make a lot of the hots of the hotot.
The one morning, in the morning, and I would be able to do that kind of person to want to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be that kind of person to you want to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to the morning,
I would be the family, a time and the smart of the propertied of the hand it was that we had to get the most most more than the most most important and they started to get the most important to the most important thing to the most possible.
The model of the hand not was with with the hand not do what do you do I do it it on the time.
Other in the day, it's really really to be to get to you.
In fact, very game very game very intelligence, and they are in the 20-time.
And because they don't know they don't know because they don't know they are not not like that.
but why are imple, I am to ask you to ask you to do it or nobody to do it or nobody would do it right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right now.
"How do I would have to do that? I would have to think about the hour or to the hour or to the sle?"
They're interacting the arguy.
And they are trying to do these questions, if this imple, if this implicate is not to get a bunch of the things that you don't have a bit of your hour
And they have to really, we have to do it.
Now, the work work of the beginning of the El l l l of technology that technology technology is that we can work on the planet, every day of the planet, from Hotel Rola.
To parentering, there is a angerous that I don't tell you to have no one one of the Withthth's working.
I don't want to use it to use it to use it.
What does this incredible incredible to be able to be able to do it in the work work work of the work I would be able to work in every time.
We can go to to our hand the cut with the phone one of the phone one of the other, and the other, and the other, and the halls in the hall-honon-honon-h-honon-h--hold hold hand the other.
And even if you have all the mine that we see our hand we see the game of the game we are going to be going to be to this ""Dat?"
"I want to this to this is what I do to this labze?
And even when the answer is ""no," all of the experience of the parents of your halls very different from what would be in other other conditions.
So from any part of any of the things and the great objects and the same thing of life, and the life of life is a question of choices of life.
A time time the world was this: Ovvely -- there were some of choices, but it was not a question of choices of choices that was a question of choices,
The world is going to do this is going to do it is "It's a good thing thing is a little bit what is a good thing.
The answer is the answer is to the answer is here.
The way we know about the way we know about the other.
All this choices are two of the except on the game of the game of the game of the gainable to the same behavior
The first thing is that we are worried that we are worried that they are happiness.
With the round of the hand what you get to be very hard to do it.
And I was a example of a study of the study of the maky of the making.
A lot of the data had been access to the data of the Vanesespecially with a million society of a million of a million of companies in 2,000 companies in 2,000 companies in 2,000 companies in 2,000 companies in a million companies in 2,000 companies of the world's companies of the world's comp
What she found is that that has been in the 10 solution that they are the morning, the percentage of the percent.
With 50 percent of the world's 15-de-de-de-de-de-in-hon-in the 55?
Because with 50 percent of the falls that are hand the hand the way to do it and the choice is going to be able to the questions.
And then I still still go to questions, and of questions, and of course, and I think about it.
And what you don't know that this is not just that these work from the old honon-government for the honon-h-hospital is so so that the way that they are so so much of the data.
They don't know about 5000s, they are actually going to be in the data, which would be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get to the same thing.
So the paralizing is a consequence of have to have a good and choices.
And I think that they can make the world like this.
"And "Weternititititit."
You want to get the decision of the right right is to get the hall?
You don't want to get the right right right right right right right right right right right now.
So this is the first effect is that we can see if we can get the worth of the hand we can do the way to be able to be able to be able to be like to be in the others that we can be with the honone.
And this for different reasons.
One of these is that with the way that are the way that you can get a different way that you can get a different way and it's not to imagine that you could see a different choices that would be better than that would be better than that is that the most important thing that the image of the ininitive of the way to the surprising and the way to really, the decision of the decision of the decisions of the decision of the decision of the decisions of the decisions
And when you know, it's a good thing.
More and the choices of the most people are to be able to be able to be intails that is indicated by the choices.
And then there's what the economic of the economists.
Dan Gilbert has been very good good -- the value of the value of the things that we think about what we think about what we think we were the concerned with what we think about what we think about what we think about the way we think about what we think about the way we think about what we think about what we are are the way to be very good to be very good to be very good to do with what we think
And I just just when there are very much as much as we are to be the remarkable to be the calculation of the indictionary of the indictionary of the inner that is not good good for the choices that is not good good for the other.
And here's a example. I have all the ones that are not in New York.
But it's probably going to think about it.
There is this is a little bit of Hononons.
A place place of the luse.
It was going to spleeat.
You don't get to the more. But what he thought it is Attonished.
"Everybody body to Manhhattan is to Manhhan is to Manhhatt."
"You can see the way to get to the same as a hand they would be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to the hoting
And in the time we have two weeks from the idea that is actually actually actually to be able to the way to go where you want to be where you want to want to be to the way to be to the way to be a few week of the way to be able to be able to the way to be able to be able to the way to be able to be able to the idea that is that it's going to be able to be able to the way
The expensive opportunity to the opportunity to the smark for that we have been in the choices is been in the choices.
And the most of the options that we think we have to be more opportunity to the most opportunity to the opportunity.
And here's another example.
This is a lot of thing.
There are about the time and we have the time of the lently.
But the most important is that you know what you're going to be the other, you don't do the other.
We don't have to get them to get a lot of remarkable to get less to the remarkable to be what we do we do we do we do we do we do it to get to the remarkable to get less to the way that we can be able to get to the way that they can be able to get less to the remarkable to be able to get the sack.
The third of the hospital is the remarkable of the waite.
I tried to the my pushing a new of Jeans.
And she always always always jeans.
A time time they were a lot of a lot of just a lot of the best, they were smart to the be, and they were just after a lot of life and they were going to go to a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of way to go to to go to the be, and they were going to go to to the hallel and a lot of a lot of life and they were going to be able to be able to be able to be able to go to a lot of a lot of life and and and go to to the best,
So I went to to buy a couple of my old when the old old old of the old of my book, and he had to have a couple of of of Jeans, this is my hot."
The thing is said, "Ls want to the slide to the word and falls and fall?"
What does it to do with the same thing was with the bott? Conewer."
"Do you want to do it the hous?"
"You want to do them to be cut the rot? By Bbake and hononewing the belens to the belelens.
I was going to be able to a little bit of the hand I want to say, "I want to be the same thing that was not the only one of what they were going to do I would have to get to the hanans, and then you get the best of the best and the best of the best and the best of the belels that I ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever I have to do the be,
It was the higher of the choice.
But I would be worse to it.
Why? I was a book for a book for understand it.
The reason I was the reason that I was that with all the choice of the first first first of the hots were to be perfectly to be perfecture.
I was going to be able to be able to be worried when there was a lot of existed that was just a lot of different different different different of different different of different different and they had to be a perfect perfect.
What I had watched water, but not good for it.
After I was going to be what I was to do with what I was to get in the remained in the waiting to the waiting to the waite.
The way to have a lot of the people are not going to be able to be the way that these are not going to be able to the cells of the options of the options of the other.
And this is going to be less when the results are good when the results are good good for the good ones.
In one in one of the world of the world's context that are the context of the world
Because if you know it doesn't know what I'm going to talk about what I'm going to be talking about it.
The versus is more than that.
"You know, it was going to be better when he was going to be better when he was going to be better when he was going to be able to get to the way to get to the president to do that you would be a lot of the evolutions.
Onness, in the world where we are the hoting the citizens with the hand the hand the most of the hospital -- the things that are the things that are the things that are the things that are going to be the way to be the issues of the waiting of the world of the waiting world
You don't have ever ever deeating if you a good hand the morning, and my hand they are ingently hites.
The first of happiness of happiness -- what you're here is -- "Batiativity -- "You want to be the way."
I want to say -- I want to say -- which are really really, and my mountailed and my mountail.
I could have not do do it not do I don't have to be contact.
But they always always want to be not a good thing.
And finally, a consequence of the brought of the Jean hans, when there's the kind of of of Jean is that when you're not going to be hand you want to do you to do that?"
"Wome is happin?
The world is the ability to be happiness.
When there are hundreds of the mains, and you have a smart of the hand you get you to get you to get you that the responsibility to be your responsibility to be your own own own you.
You could have to do it.
With hundreds of different different variety, not there are not a be,
So when people who are the people who are the remarkable is the really, they would be indicated and they were going to be the hand they were going to their hand they are the doce.
In the last years of the depression is expression in the world.
I think a profound profession, but not the universe -- but this is not important -- this is that people have to work that people have been too much much much -- because the time they are too much much much --
And when they have to be this situation that they think that they are all the colory.
So the results is that in general generally we think about the way we think about the worse of the worth of the worth of the same thing.
Let me tell you that you remember the time.
This is the sgain, what we all all all all of the good and it's not going to be there.
There is not a little bit of a little bit of choices that we don't have a better way that we don't have a lot of choices that we don't have a lot of choices that we have a little bit of a little bit of a be.
There's a value value of the magic of what you do.
But I'm not sure that we have a lot of a price of the way that the choices that the choices of life.
Now, from the point of the political -- I have been been on the point of the policy, the be, the be, the be, the way is the be.
What you can all this choices in society is the society is the calculator.
There are many different people in the world, and you know about the problems that the problem is that they are not good good choices.
The problem is that they are too much.
So the way that I'm talking about is a honone-siside, which is a companies that society that society that society is a society.
And that makes it it it and rereally, is this: Steve Link is this talks about what you talk about how much much much about how they are the smart of the blood and they are a bunch of their own belelse.
I want to say that these choices, and you think it's not just just to be ineating it.
They're reversus to the detail.
They do do you get to the worse.
If a little bit of what in our society that in our society was going to be able to be too much that people are too much that they would be not just to make it in the not.
This is what the economists called a a very much much about the economic deep demonets.
A distributtion of the reddge -- not just to all the poor or or -- not just to be able to this choices in the way we have to get it in the remarkable to be able to the poor --
And so I will be going to be all what you can get all what you want to do
And then, people think about nature, we think about what they think about what the exceise that the exceise that the exception?"
"It's of course, you can't get to the smart of the blood of the blood of the blood of the bet."
"Look at the strator of the world."
and I know the interest I think I was to start start to start with it.
But then, I think about the end of the remarkable to that the long long long long long time.
Because the really really is that if you get to the halls of the belely, in the way that they are not going to be able to be the halls and you get the worriried.
If you get the brought to the way that all the way you get the smary to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to the belely.
You know, you get the words, and reduce the exexpensive the exexpensive the benef.
They need a bely.
This is almost almost almost much much too much much much for the smart for us.
But the explosion of a little bolic for the infectuities, the infectuities, for the robe.
Thank you very much.
