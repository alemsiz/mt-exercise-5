<unk> year I showed these <unk> for <unk> <unk> that the <unk> <unk> <unk>, which is for almost three million years, the United States has had the size of <unk> <unk>, <unk> is <unk> 40 percent.
<unk> this <unk> of the problem because it's not <unk> the ice <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> is, in a way, the heart of the climate system.
It's <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
The next next 25 years.
<unk> <unk> are <unk> in red.
And as you can see, you get <unk> to the blue <unk>.
That's the ice in <unk>, which <unk> <unk> <unk>.
You can see that the ice <unk> <unk>, five years or more, is like the blood, that here <unk> from the body.
<unk> years, it's been <unk> by so.
This is a problem because the <unk> is a problem because the <unk> is <unk> <unk> <unk> that, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, they are <unk> in <unk>.
<unk> at the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, that <unk> <unk> this point of not <unk>.
In some <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> the <unk> is already <unk> from the water.
The <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>! Al <unk>: She's good. The question is if you <unk> it also.
That's a reason that this <unk> <unk> <unk> from the North.
This is a river to <unk> <unk>.
<unk> had never <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This is the <unk> <unk> <unk>, in the <unk> of the <unk>.
If you want to know how the <unk> level of the sea <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk>, here is where we <unk> the sea.
These <unk> are <unk> <unk>.
<unk> other side of the planet: <unk>, the largest <unk> of ice <unk> of ice <unk>.
The last month, scientists have <unk> that the ice <unk> is in <unk>, and that the <unk> <unk>, which <unk> <unk> on some <unk> <unk>, is particularly <unk> in <unk>.
<unk> to six feet of the <unk> level of the <unk>, like <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, the largest <unk> of ice, they see new <unk>, which a few years ago, they were <unk>.
40 percent of the world population <unk> water from the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the world's <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>: this <unk> is the source of the water <unk> of this city.
<unk> is <unk>.
But when you <unk>, it's going on the <unk> water.
In California, <unk> on <unk> <unk> is <unk> 40 percent.
<unk> <unk> are in crisis.
<unk>, as you read, they're <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> in the world <unk> to a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> are <unk> to a <unk> out of the normal and without <unk>.
<unk> times more <unk> in the last 30 years, the <unk> <unk>.
This is a <unk> of all <unk>.
If you look at the context of the <unk> context, you can see the <unk>.
We have <unk> 70 million <unk> <unk> million <unk> CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million <unk> of <unk> in the oceans every day.
Look at the <unk> area, from <unk> <unk>, from <unk>, <unk>, and on both parts of the <unk> <unk>, where there is a oxygen <unk> in the oceans.
The most <unk> of global warming, together to <unk>, which is 20 percent, is the use of <unk> <unk>.
The oil is a problem, and the <unk> is even worse.
The United States is one of the two countries with more emissions, together.
And they were <unk> to build a lot of other <unk> to <unk>.
But we're <unk> to a <unk> of <unk>.
These are the projects <unk> in the last years and some <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
And every way, there is a <unk> politics in our country.
The <unk> of <unk> and oil <unk> <unk> million dollars in the last year to <unk> the last year to <unk> the <unk> <unk>, which is a <unk>.
<unk> image to me --
<unk> <unk>, in <unk>, where there was a <unk> of <unk> billion <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
Maybe you saw it on the <unk>.
This is the second <unk> flow in America.
It's happened around <unk>.
<unk> <unk> of one of the <unk> <unk> was this.
<unk>: <unk> â™« <unk> <unk> <unk> is a <unk> <unk> and happy.
It's <unk> here in America, and it makes our economy.
<unk> the <unk> is more <unk>.
It's good price, <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> here is a lot of the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The largest society <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk>. This is his <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk> -- Al <unk> <unk> -- Al <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> -- they don't know what they're talking about.
<unk>: So <unk> for the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> has <unk> two <unk>.
This is one of them, one part.
<unk>: <unk> <unk>: <unk> <unk> we see the <unk> changes as a <unk> <unk> to our business.
For this <unk> our <unk> is <unk> a big amount of money in a <unk> <unk> to make public public <unk> and <unk> the truth on the <unk>.
In fact, <unk> is not <unk>.
We think it's <unk> -- it has a good <unk>.
So we don't know about climate change.
We do do it.
<unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk> -- you've heard a lot of it.
So, I <unk> a <unk> structure to <unk> how much <unk> <unk>.
<unk>! The cars are a little bit <unk>, but this is the sound of <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> is between the <unk> of global global warming, but the <unk> technology of <unk> <unk> that you see everything.
And we look at a look: this is the <unk> technology of <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to the economic question and the national security.
<unk>: <unk> America is in crisis; the economy, the national <unk>, the national crisis.
The <unk> that <unk> all: our <unk> <unk> from the <unk> <unk>, like <unk> <unk> <unk> and oil.
Now, there's a new, <unk> solution to <unk>.
<unk> America: 100 percent of <unk> energy, in 10 years.
A plan for <unk> America to work, <unk> more <unk>, and to help <unk> global.
<unk>, a solution that we <unk> to solve our problems.
<unk> America. <unk> more.
<unk>: This is the last.
<unk>: <unk> is <unk> <unk> energy to America.
One of the most <unk> ways of <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> that <unk> our planet.
<unk>: The future is here. <unk>, <unk>, a new network network.
<unk> <unk>: <unk> <unk> for places.
<unk>: <unk> America. It's time to be <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk> says, "If you want to go, you go from the only one.
If you want to go away, you go. "
We have to go away, quickly.
Thank you very much.
<unk> year, I did a <unk> on the <unk>.
And <unk> of <unk> <unk> to <unk> about how the machine works.
So here, it's <unk>. And the other time, there were no, the <unk> is the largest <unk> experiment that <unk> <unk> <unk> -- <unk> miles.
<unk> is to <unk> the conditions that were <unk> less than a second <unk> of a second <unk> of the universe -- to <unk> million times a second.
All of that's just <unk>.
This is the machine under <unk>.
<unk> these <unk> <unk> <unk> inside the <unk>.
This is what I work. It's called <unk> <unk> -- is <unk> <unk> feet and it has a <unk> <unk> feet.
This is a picture of <unk> <unk> in building so you can see the <unk>.
The 10 <unk> of the last year we <unk> the first car.
And this picture was <unk> by <unk>.
It was <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of control.
It's an image of the first <unk> particles that had done all the around the <unk> <unk>, <unk>, with a part of the <unk>, and <unk> particles in the <unk>.
In other words, when you <unk> that image the 10 <unk>, <unk> that the machine, the machine that's a great <unk>.
I don't know if it was this to <unk> us more or this, when somebody <unk> on Google and <unk> that the <unk> <unk> was this.
What means we have a <unk> impact over to the scientific impact over the <unk>.
<unk> a week later, there was a problem with the car, it had to be these <unk> here -- these <unk> <unk>.
These <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> when the machine works at the <unk> of the <unk>.
Now, the <unk> between you <unk> the <unk> and <unk>, "<unk>'t it. They're too <unk>."
And instead can do that because when they're very <unk> <unk> <unk>.
So, <unk> <unk> degrees <unk>, at a <unk> temperature <unk> to that space between the stars, these <unk> can bring that <unk>.
In one of the <unk> between the most <unk> <unk> in the <unk>, there was a <unk> of <unk>.
So the <unk> <unk> <unk>, and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This was the result.
Now, this is more <unk> if you think that these <unk> <unk> more than 20 <unk>, and that <unk> of about 30 <unk>.
It's <unk> about 50 <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, what we did.
We <unk> them and <unk>.
Now, they're going to <unk> all of their <unk> place.
<unk> the end of <unk> the <unk> is going to be new <unk>.
<unk> <unk> it, and we <unk> to get data to <unk> or <unk>, and keep so our <unk> to find what the universe is <unk> that <unk> the universe.
Now, of course, in a certain way, these <unk> <unk> the value of science and <unk> of <unk>. It's easy to <unk>.
I think the fact that it is so hard, the fact that it is the value of things like <unk>.
I want to end with the words of a <unk> <unk>, which, <unk> <unk>, which, <unk>, in <unk> of the <unk> experiments of <unk>, his <unk> was Michael <unk>, said, "No," No is so much for the <unk> of the human mind as the <unk> that the <unk> of science, that there are not <unk>, our <unk>, <unk> of our <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
I want to start to <unk> <unk> when, children, <unk> with <unk>.
<unk> <unk> as <unk> and <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> actually to think and <unk> problems.
The <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> to the way that we <unk> part of the world around us.
So, from <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of our <unk> with <unk> objects, together to my <unk> <unk>, and my <unk> <unk> <unk>, and I started <unk>, and then, "And if we use a computer, instead of <unk> <unk> <unk> as digital <unk> <unk>, as a <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
and <unk> to <unk> our <unk>?
The question was so interesting that I was going to explore the answer, building the answer.
In a few words, a <unk> is a big computer.
In a few words, a <unk> is a big computer.
You can <unk> them with the hand, they can feel the <unk>, feel the <unk> movement and a radio <unk>.
But <unk>, are <unk> objects, like <unk>, they can just <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> is the example of a new <unk> of tools for <unk> information.
And as as a hand that become more <unk>, <unk> of the other, of the other, of the other, of the other, of how they <unk> them, of how we can explore new and <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
<unk> with a simple example.
This <unk> is <unk> to show you video: if you <unk> it in a <unk>, the video video <unk> so, if you get from the other side.
These <unk> <unk> are <unk> of the other.
If you <unk> them, you know what it's going around.
If they're <unk>, you can <unk> it, you know.
If they're <unk>, you can <unk> it, you know.
They also <unk> their movement and <unk>.
We then <unk> that one of the interesting interesting <unk> of the <unk> was the <unk> that we can use <unk> on the data, for example, "<unk> color as if it was a <unk>.
In this case, we have three <unk> <unk> as a <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> of color in the central <unk>, where they <unk>.
And I can <unk> to <unk> the color in the central <unk>, where you <unk>.
If you're too much, we can <unk> a little bit of place.
I'm also <unk> to <unk> <unk>, like <unk>, the math and games where people are trying to try to do things quickly, and <unk> <unk>.
Now, I'm --
This is a <unk> <unk> that I do with a <unk> program.
Here we have a game of words that's in the <unk> and <unk>.
<unk>, at every <unk> <unk> a letter at every <unk>, <unk>, to every <unk> <unk>, to every <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> of <unk> words, he <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and while you get words, he <unk> on a <unk>.
Then, about 30 seconds, you know, and you have a new <unk> of <unk> and new chance to try.
Thank you.
Here's the children <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk>, I did that that <unk> them and I <unk> a video.
They're <unk> very much.
And one of the interesting things of this <unk> is that you don't have to give people a lot of <unk>.
<unk> only to say, "<unk> of words," and they know exactly what to do.
Here's here, people who <unk> it.
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk>, there on the right.
It wanted to be just <unk>.
They were just <unk>, for him.
Now, this is a <unk> of a <unk> <unk>.
<unk> to build a tool for the <unk> of the <unk>. He's <unk>.
It can <unk> new characters in the scene, <unk> their <unk>.
It can <unk> new characters in the scene, <unk> their <unk>.
And that's doing out the sun.
<unk>: The sun is <unk>.
David <unk>: Now, it has <unk> a <unk> in the scene.
<unk>: <unk> <unk>.
<unk> work!
So <unk> the <unk> and <unk> can <unk> the characters --
<unk>: <unk>!
<unk> your story.
<unk>: <unk>!
<unk>: It's a <unk> story with the final <unk>, and it can decide him as a <unk>.
<unk>: It's a <unk> story with the final <unk>, and it can decide him as a <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> <unk>.
<unk>: The last example that I've got time to show you a <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> music.
It's a tool, made of <unk>, <unk> and <unk> music.
The <unk> here is <unk> by <unk> <unk> as the <unk>, and the <unk>.
<unk> of these have four different <unk>, and you can choose what you use.
You can also <unk> these <unk> in a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And I just <unk> <unk> a sound <unk> a sound <unk>. "
These are actually <unk> that you can control from the <unk>, like <unk> and <unk>.
It's going to <unk> it to a particular sound and then <unk> it.
And then there are the <unk> actually as time and <unk>, which <unk> <unk> to the entire sequence.
<unk> as it works.
<unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> in two <unk> <unk>, "<unk> <unk> in a series, the <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
Now, you're going to take a line of the bottom.
<unk>: <unk> <unk>: Now, <unk> of the <unk> <unk>
<unk>: <unk>. And now I <unk> the <unk> to the <unk>, so I can control the effect of the live in.
<unk>: <unk> the whole <unk> <unk> the whole <unk> <unk> the time from one side or the other.
<unk>: <unk>. And now we <unk> the <unk> <unk> to give more <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> <unk>: I can <unk> the <unk> <unk>.
So I don't have to <unk> before, but I can <unk>, <unk> more <unk> or more <unk>.
And now, finally, I can <unk> the entire <unk> <unk> on the left <unk> <unk>.
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is to build new <unk> new <unk> <unk> to how to work work in our brain and body.
And today, I had time to show you one of this <unk>, and some chance that we try to get out of the lab.
The concept I want to <unk> is that it's <unk> this new <unk> of <unk> objects to <unk> the average <unk>, that <unk> information information information in our world that we want.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the now now I'm not going to talk to you.
I'm a <unk>.
<unk> books is my <unk>, but it's more than this, of course.
It's also love and <unk> of my life.
And I don't know what it can change.
But, said, this is, something particular is <unk> in my career, and my career, which has taken me the whole relationship with this work.
The particular thing is that I wrote about this book, this <unk> called "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, which <unk> <unk>, which which, <unk> from my <unk> books, for some reason to the world and <unk>, <unk>.
And the result is that <unk> everywhere, people <unk> me as if I was <unk>.
<unk> -- <unk>, <unk>!
<unk> me to me, I'm going to say, "You're not going to do it more to do it?
You're not fear of <unk> to write for all life without more to be able to create a book that can <unk> someone? "
What can you get to someone? "
It's <unk>, you know.
But it may be worse, at the one of the <unk> I remember that more than 20 years ago, when I <unk> to say, I was a <unk> -- I wanted to be a <unk>.
I'm going to <unk> to <unk> the same <unk> <unk>.
And people said, "Do you don't know that they're going to have success?
You're not fear that the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>?
You're not fear of doing this <unk> for all life without anything else is going out and die on a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>? "
So, you know.
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is, "You know.
And I fear of all those things.
I always had fear.
And I'm also fear of a lot of other things that people may not be <unk>.
As <unk> and other things.
But, for how about write what I thought, and I thought <unk> <unk> is why?
Is it <unk>?
It's <unk> that anyone who <unk> <unk> to be <unk> by a work that you feel <unk> to do.
But what's there so particular in the <unk> <unk> <unk> about the health <unk> <unk> about a way that other <unk> do not?
How do my father, for example, he was a <unk> <unk> and I didn't remember one time in his 40 years of activity where the were asked asked if they were asked to be <unk>?
It was never -- that <unk> <unk> of John <unk>, how do it?
<unk>'t <unk> so, <unk>?
<unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We <unk>, we have enough this <unk>, and not only <unk>, but <unk> of all that, we have this <unk> to be <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And they don't know that look at the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that, only in the <unk> century, young and <unk>, young and often hand.
And the ones that you don't seem to be <unk> by their <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, first of <unk> <unk> said, "Every my book <unk> <unk>, he <unk> me a little more <unk> about the work of their life.
But we didn't <unk> <unk> when we heard this is, because we heard these things so long, we've got completely <unk> and <unk> the <unk> that creativity and <unk> that art is <unk>, and the art, to the end, <unk>, <unk>, always <unk>.
And the question I want to <unk> to all here today is, you're <unk> with this idea?
It's going to tell you that -- because it also <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> me.
I think it's <unk>.
And I think it's also <unk> and I don't want to <unk> <unk> in the next century.
I think it's better <unk> our big <unk> to live.
And I think, in my case -- in my case -- in my situation -- it would be a very <unk> to start <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in which I have in my career.
<unk> -- <unk> look at <unk>, I'm pretty young, I've been <unk>.
I still have about four <unk> of work in me.
And it's very <unk> that any <unk> of what we're going to be <unk> from the world like the work that <unk> after the <unk> of my last book.
<unk> <unk>, because we're all about <unk>, because we're all <unk> of my largest success is to my <unk>.
Oh, <unk>, <unk> thinking!
You know, this is the kind of thinking that brings a person to <unk> <unk> at nine morning and I don't want to do it.
I'm going to keep this work that I love.
So, the question becomes, how?
And so, I seem to me, after a lot of <unk>, that the way to work to write what to create a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, right?
I have to find a <unk> distance of security between me, which I'm <unk>, and my natural <unk> on what <unk> <unk> <unk> to get. And as we <unk> for all last year year, to look through the time, looking at the time, looking at the time, looking at other society to see if they have better ideas and <unk>. And I'm going to be able to see that, I'm going to be <unk>, and then, and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
about how to help people <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity.
And that <unk> me to the <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
<unk> because it <unk> in <unk> and then <unk> back.
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> -- people don't believe that <unk> creativity from men, OK?
It <unk> that creativity was this <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> to the men from a few <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>, for <unk> reasons and <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> these <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of creativity. "
<unk>, <unk>, <unk> to have a <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> from <unk>.
The <unk> were the same idea, but <unk> that species of the spirit without a <unk>.
The <unk> is <unk>, because the <unk> didn't really know that a <unk> was somebody who are particularly <unk>.
<unk> that a <unk> was this species of <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> literally <unk> in the <unk> of a artist <unk>, a little bit like the <unk> <unk>, and that <unk> out to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> the artist and <unk> the <unk> of that work.
<unk> <unk> here, that's the distance of what I talk -- that <unk> <unk> <unk> you from the results of your work.
And everyone <unk> that was so that <unk>, right?
So, artists were <unk> by <unk> things, like, for example, <unk> too <unk>, no?
If your work was <unk> not <unk> <unk> all the <unk>, everybody <unk> that <unk> was <unk> by this <unk> <unk>.
If your work <unk>, it was not all your work, right?
All you know that was your <unk> to be a <unk>.
And so people <unk> <unk> <unk> creativity in <unk> for a long time.
Then the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all <unk>, and <unk> this great idea; we put the human being on the universe on the universe, the middle of the universe, the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>.
This was the principle of <unk> <unk> and people <unk> to think that <unk> creativity completely <unk> by <unk>.
And for the first time in the history, you <unk> to <unk> this or that artist as a <unk> <unk> to a <unk> <unk> to a person with <unk>.
And I have to <unk>, I think it was a big <unk>.
I think you're going to be <unk> to someone, a simple person person to believe that the source, <unk> and <unk> <unk> of all the <unk> <unk>, <unk> and <unk> <unk>, <unk> and <unk> is a responsibility to give the human <unk>.
It's like to ask someone to <unk> the sun.
<unk> and <unk> completely <unk> and <unk> all these <unk> <unk> on the <unk>.
And I think it was this pressure pressure to have <unk> artists in 500 years.
And, if that's true, and I think it's, the question becomes, and now?
Can we do it?
We can go back to a more <unk> of the relationship between human and <unk> <unk>.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we can't <unk> 500 years of <unk> thinking in a 18 minutes.
And there's probably people in the audience that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of <unk>, you know, you know that <unk> people <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> their projects.
You probably don't know about this thing.
But the question I would like to <unk> is -- why not?
Why don't you know that?
Because it has more sense of every other thing that ever heard about the <unk> <unk> process.
One process that, as anyone who ever <unk> to do something -- so, we basically all here -- they're all here -- you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, a process process of the <unk>.
And, in fact, it can <unk> completely <unk>.
I did this <unk> with the extraordinary <unk> <unk> <unk>, who has now 90 years, but that was a <unk> for all life and said that during his <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> out of his <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> out of the <unk>. And then, in the <unk> from the <unk> <unk>.
He said that it was like a <unk> <unk> air.
And that <unk> <unk> <unk> to her from the <unk>.
<unk> <unk> it to get it, because he was <unk> the earth under her feet.
And I decided to have one thing to do that point of doing that point and was, words, "<unk> as a <unk>."
And so I was <unk> to the house and it was <unk> by this <unk>, and it wouldn't have to take a piece of paper and a little bit of a paper, <unk> and <unk> on the page.
<unk> times, they don't get enough to be <unk>, so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> the <unk> through the <unk> and her <unk> and she would be <unk> through the <unk>, and then he would be <unk> through the <unk>, to the <unk>, and he said, "another <unk>."
And then there were those times -- this <unk> never -- there were moments that were moments in the <unk> was almost <unk>, right?
So, he was <unk> home and he was trying to paper and <unk> the <unk> through, and <unk> a <unk> <unk> in the while that was <unk>, and then said, it was like if you <unk> with the other hand and then he was <unk>.
<unk> the <unk> from the tail and <unk> in his body and <unk> on the page.
And in these cases, the <unk> would be <unk> on the <unk> page, but the <unk>, the last word to the first word first.
So when you <unk> <unk> -- it's <unk>, it's exactly <unk> to my <unk> process.
I don't all my <unk> process -- I'm not a <unk>!
I'm a <unk>, and my way of <unk> is; it <unk> at the same <unk> every day and <unk> and work on the <unk>.
But even I, in my <unk>, I <unk> against that thing, sometimes.
And I think that a lot of you the <unk> it.
You know, even though the work and the ideas I would <unk> <unk> by a certain source, I couldn't <unk> <unk>.
And what is this thing?
And how can we <unk> it to do it in a way that you can't do you know, but rather, what do you do you do it?
For how much I about, the best example I have a <unk> <unk> <unk>, which I have <unk> different years ago for a <unk>.
<unk> <unk> of this, and you know, <unk>, for the <unk> of life was the <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> these species of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
But then <unk>, <unk>, and a day while <unk> was <unk> on a <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> all for him.
<unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, that's a <unk> <unk>, that comes in the head of how it does <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, but not know how to <unk>.
It's not a piece of paper, no <unk>, it has no <unk>.
So, you start to feel this kind of old <unk> <unk> to <unk>, "I'm going to <unk>, and <unk> <unk> by this song.
I'm not enough <unk> and I can't <unk>. "
And instead of go to the <unk>, they <unk>.
<unk> the whole process of <unk> and made something completely new.
<unk> just the sky and said, "<unk>, you see I'm <unk>?"
"You know, do you know, about you know?
If you really want to <unk>, you'll <unk> it in a more <unk> when I can <unk> care about you.
<unk>, <unk> to <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. "
And his <unk> process after this.
Not the work, the work was still <unk> as always.
But the process, and the <unk> <unk> that <unk> was <unk> when <unk> the <unk>, the <unk> that <unk> <unk> out of him <unk> that problems and <unk> it <unk> it <unk> that problems and <unk> <unk> it was <unk>, and <unk> it was <unk> that didn't have to be a <unk> thing and <unk>.
But I <unk> this <unk>, wonderful <unk> <unk> a conversation between <unk> and this thing that <unk> and this <unk> and <unk> that it was not <unk>.
So, how <unk> that <unk> story to change a little bit of the way that I <unk> it.
This idea, I was <unk> when I was <unk>, "<unk>," <unk>, "and I <unk> in one of the <unk> of the <unk> that we're working on something and we can't think that's going on something that is going to be a <unk>, that what the book will ever be.
Not just <unk>, just <unk> book, just wrote a book.
And I'm going to think about <unk> this project.
But then I <unk> to me to <unk> that <unk> the air and <unk>.
So I <unk> my face on the <unk> and <unk> my <unk> to a <unk> <unk> of the room.
And I said to <unk> <unk>, "<unk>, what, both we know that if this book is not going to be <unk> <unk> my, no?
Because you see me, I'm <unk> all that I have, I don't have this.
So if you want you to do it, you have to do your part.
OK. But if you don't do it, you know, you don't know anything.
I'm going to write the same because it is my work.
And I'd like to say, I'd like to do my part of the <unk> because -- the end is so, then, then then, it's so, <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of Africa, <unk> the <unk> of the moon, <unk> music that <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the moon, <unk> <unk>, <unk> hours to <unk> hours, <unk> hours hours,
And they were always <unk>, because the <unk> were <unk> and <unk>.
But every <unk>, something <unk>, and one of these <unk> artists actually <unk>.
And I know you know what I talk about, because I know you've got all, at some point, a <unk>.
It was like the time <unk>, and the <unk> <unk> through a species of <unk> and he was not doing anything different from the <unk>, as the <unk> <unk> first, but everything <unk>.
And all of all the <unk> not only as a human.
But they <unk> from the <unk> and under the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>.
And when this <unk>, people <unk> what was, the <unk> people who was, he <unk> her name.
<unk> your hands and <unk> to <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>, God, God," God, God, God, "God," God, "
That's God, you know.
<unk> <unk> <unk> -- when the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> this <unk> with them and <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, "<unk>," <unk>, "<unk>," <unk>, "<unk>," <unk>, "which you can still feel in the <unk> or <unk>.
In <unk>, when a artist has done something impossible and <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>,
And it's <unk> because we need.
But the problem is the problem is the day after the <unk>, when you <unk> and <unk> that are 11 of <unk> <unk> and <unk> that are the 11 of God's <unk>.
It's just a <unk> with a lot of <unk> to <unk>, and maybe never <unk> to <unk> that.
And maybe nobody <unk> the name of God still as <unk>, and what has to do with the rest of his life?
It's hard.
This is one of the most <unk> <unk> to do in a <unk> life.
But maybe it doesn't have to be so <unk> if you're not believe, <unk>, <unk>, that the <unk> <unk> of your <unk> are from you.
But I just <unk> that you're <unk> data in <unk> by a <unk> source of this <unk> part of your life that you have to go to <unk>.
And, you know, if we think in this way.
And so I started <unk>, and it's <unk> as I <unk> for different months during the <unk> of the book that <unk> <unk>, the <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> of my <unk> success.
And what I have to keep <unk> when I feel <unk> by this is, I don't fear.
Don't <unk>. <unk> only your work.
<unk> to <unk> your <unk>, any <unk>, any <unk> can be.
If your work is <unk>, <unk>.
If the <unk>, you're going to <unk> you to <unk> some kind of <unk> <unk>, for a <unk> moment through your <unk>, then you're going to be <unk> <unk>, then, "<unk>!"
You do the same <unk> your <unk>.
And "<unk>!" <unk>! "
I think, and I think it's <unk> <unk>.
"<unk>!" <unk>! "<unk>, only for <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk>: <unk>!
And as I've already talked about some of these projects on the human genome, on what the discovery of new <unk> of genes.
We're going to <unk> a new way: we started <unk> the biology and now now, we start from that digital code, <unk> and <unk> life.
We always tried to <unk> <unk> big questions.
"<unk> is the life?" It's something that many <unk>, I think they have to <unk> different levels.
We tried to <unk> <unk>, <unk> to <unk> terms.
We're <unk> by almost 20 years.
When we <unk> the human genome <unk> <unk> to go from the <unk> world of biology to the digital world of the computer.
Now, we <unk> life, or create new life from this digital universe?
This is the map of a little <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, which is the species from the most small genome between those who can <unk> in the lab.
And we tried to <unk> the genome to <unk> a more small <unk>.
We're able to <unk> a genes of about 500 genes that are here.
But when we give a look at its <unk> map, is <unk> simple than our.
<unk>, this is simple.
But when we look at all genes that we can <unk>, one at one time, is very <unk> that this can bring a <unk> cell.
So, <unk> that the only <unk> <unk> <unk> this <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> some of these questions.
And so we started the <unk> of the <unk> "We can <unk> a <unk>?
Can the <unk> chemistry of produce these big molecules that we never had been able to create first time?
And, in case, can we make a <unk> <unk>?
A <unk> is just a piece of <unk> material.
The speed with which we can <unk> life is <unk> to <unk> <unk>.
Our ability to write the <unk> code, instead, rather, <unk> rather, but it's <unk>.
And our <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We've got more 15 years ago.
The <unk> process has <unk> a lot of <unk>, <unk> with a <unk> <unk> before <unk> the first experiments.
But we found that <unk> of DNA is very difficult.
There are <unk> of thousands of cars in the world that <unk> small DNA, of the <unk> <unk> of 30 to 50 <unk> and is a <unk> process: the more <unk> <unk>, the more <unk> <unk> is <unk>.
We had to develop a new <unk> to <unk> these <unk> and <unk> the <unk>.
And this was our first <unk>, to start from the digital <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's a little <unk> <unk> that bacteria.
We designed the <unk>, <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of DNA <unk> <unk>.
The interesting part is when we took this piece of <unk> material <unk> <unk> and we <unk> it in bacteria, the bacteria have <unk> to read this code and <unk> particles.
<unk> particles are <unk> by cells, they're <unk> by cells, they <unk> <unk> <unk>.
I talked about the recent <unk> <unk> <unk> that they have certainly <unk> this model.
They <unk> more than you.
<unk> that this is a situation where the software can actually build his <unk> <unk> system.
But we do things in big.
We could build the whole <unk> of <unk>.
They are more than <unk> <unk> <unk> code.
So we thought of <unk> <unk> in the size of the virus, so that we can change the <unk> to understand what the <unk> is a <unk> cell.
The <unk> is <unk>, and if you <unk> information in a computer, these have to be very <unk>.
When we <unk> this genome for the first time in <unk> the <unk> <unk> was a <unk> for every 10 <unk> <unk>.
We found, <unk>, 30 <unk> <unk>. If you used that original <unk> <unk> never <unk> that they would never have to do this work.
One of the process is design <unk> 50 <unk> that <unk> with all the other <unk> of the other <unk> 50 <unk> to build more small <unk> that <unk> together.
<unk> elements here.
You probably know, you've got read that.
<unk> <unk>: We have a <unk> code <unk> on four <unk>: <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> of those <unk> <unk> together, and there's a <unk> order to <unk> every <unk>.
So we can use the code for <unk> words, <unk>, <unk>.
What we did at the beginning is <unk>.
Some were <unk> by the fact that it didn't <unk>.
We designed these <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk>.
There are <unk> that <unk> them and <unk> <unk> them.
And we started to <unk> <unk> of the parts, <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to them to get to <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We've made these <unk> <unk> in <unk> so that we're <unk> to create a <unk> <unk> <unk>, as you'll see in a minute.
We're trying to <unk> the process.
So, this seems the <unk> of a <unk> of <unk>.
When we <unk> these <unk> very <unk>, more than 100 <unk> <unk>, they don't get more directly to the <unk> <unk>.
It's <unk> to the <unk> of the biology.
So we <unk> other <unk>.
<unk> of another <unk> called <unk> <unk>, which in biology <unk> to <unk> DNA that can <unk> DNA.
Here's a example.
This <unk>, called <unk> <unk>, can <unk> three million <unk> of <unk>.
You can see the <unk> <unk> as his <unk> <unk> is <unk>.
In 12 -- 24 hours is <unk> exactly like that was first.
<unk> thousands of organisms that are able to do this.
These organisms can <unk> completely <unk>.
We're going under <unk> <unk>.
They're absolutely sure that life <unk> in space, and they <unk> to find new <unk> of water.
At the real, NASA has shown that this is.
This is an image of the <unk> that we built using these <unk>, just using the <unk> with the <unk> design <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> <unk> them.
This image is not <unk> with a <unk> <unk>, but with a <unk> <unk>.
It's a <unk> <unk> so big that we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk>.
These are pictures that <unk> a period of about six seconds.
This is the <unk> that we did a little time ago.
They are more than <unk> <unk> code.
It's the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from man.
It's a <unk> <unk> <unk> to 300 million.
If you <unk> it with a <unk> 10 <unk>, <unk> pages to <unk> this code.
Now, how do we do it work?
Of course, through a virus is a <unk> game.
It's a little bit more <unk> when they use.
It's more simple when it's <unk> cells as our <unk>, as you can just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> another, which is <unk> process.
In the <unk> <unk> <unk> is instead of <unk> the cell, but we <unk> <unk> that we can do a <unk> <unk> of a <unk> <unk> of a <unk> <unk> from one cell to another cell another and <unk>.
We <unk> a <unk> <unk> from a <unk> species.
The two different <unk> as the <unk> men from <unk>.
We <unk> some <unk> <unk> in a more way that you can decide what to <unk> this.
And then it <unk> with <unk> <unk> in a way of <unk> all the <unk>.
And when we put it in the cell was <unk> and <unk> our <unk> <unk> the new <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And <unk> <unk> that we didn't go beyond, but we tried to <unk> more <unk> in there.
This is one of the <unk> of evolution.
We found that <unk> species have <unk> a second or a third <unk> from some <unk>, <unk> in a second thousands of new <unk> to that species.
So who think about the evolution of the evolution of the evolution of the biology.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> DNA.
The <unk> that was in the cell didn't have one.
The <unk> <unk> that we <unk> the <unk> has.
It's <unk>, and it <unk> the other <unk> like <unk> material, has <unk>, and we <unk> with only the cell and the new <unk>.
It's become blue to the genes that we <unk>.
And in a short <unk> of time, all of a <unk> of a species are <unk>, and it's <unk> all in a new species, <unk> on the new software, we have <unk> in the cell.
All the <unk> are <unk>, the <unk> are <unk>, and when we <unk> the code <unk> <unk> exactly what we have <unk>.
Now, this may be <unk> <unk>, but we <unk> the software software, we can change things things in a way to be <unk> enough.
Now, I've already <unk> that here is not about <unk> -- but of progress to go from three million years and a half million years and a evolution of evolution, and I've already said that maybe we're going to create a new version of <unk> <unk>, which we're going to create new species of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, which is a new <unk> of this process.
Why do that?
I think it's enough to <unk> when we think about our <unk>.
We're going to go from six billion and a half billion people to <unk> billion people in the next 40 years.
Right to give a example: I was born in <unk> <unk>.
Now, there are three people on the planet to <unk> <unk> in <unk>; there are four years, there are going to be four.
We're going to <unk> with food, water and <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, <unk> and <unk> for six billion and a half and a people.
<unk> more <unk> to do this for nine billion.
<unk> more than five billion <unk> <unk>, more than 30 billion <unk> <unk>.
That means 100 million <unk> a day.
When we try to find <unk> <unk>, or any kind of <unk> process, it will be a huge challenge.
In more we have to realize the <unk> of CO2 from these materials that <unk> in the atmosphere.
At the day of today, <unk> <unk> <unk> in all the world, we have a <unk> with about 20 million genes, and I like to think that are the future <unk> for the future.
The <unk> industry only one <unk> about <unk> of <unk>, and think about how many different things are <unk> out.
Our <unk> here is <unk> data from reality from the <unk> reality and our imagination.
We now have <unk>, because of these <unk> <unk> <unk>, to <unk> these <unk> <unk>, to create what we call <unk> <unk>.
We're able to build a big robot that can produce a <unk> robot that can produce a day.
Think of <unk> these 20 million genes or try to try to <unk> the <unk> to produce <unk> or <unk>, new <unk>, we can change, new <unk>, and create more biology now, to create more biology now, and create more biology now.
And it's just a <unk> <unk>.
We can choose to <unk> <unk>, <unk> chemistry, <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This is a <unk> of some software software <unk> that we're working for being able to <unk> and design species to the computer.
Well, we don't know how to be.
We know exactly exactly how their code is.
Now we're <unk> on the <unk> of <unk> generation.
You saw you also <unk> <unk> from the <unk> was a <unk> experiment.
We <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> as well as <unk> as a <unk> <unk> <unk> as much more than <unk> or different kinds of <unk>.
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without <unk> <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the <unk> would be <unk> CO2 in matter before, for which we're working for design cells that can reach the first <unk> of <unk> in the generation of <unk>.
The solar light <unk> with the CO2 is a <unk>, but in our <unk> <unk> in the world, we found different <unk>.
This is a <unk> that we <unk> in the <unk>.
<unk> in the ocean, about <unk> feet of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of water.
<unk> <unk> <unk> using hydrogen <unk> as <unk> using hydrogen <unk> as the source.
We're trying to understand if we can <unk> CO2, that can easily be <unk> by <unk> <unk>, <unk> that CO2 in <unk>, to drive this process.
So, we think short we think we might be able to <unk> what the question of the <unk> of what is life, we <unk> the <unk> <unk> of <unk> the whole industry.
<unk>. If you can't do this TED, where you can't you do it?
It's a main source of energy.
<unk>, we're working on using <unk> <unk> to create <unk> <unk>.
You saw this year with flu, we always go back to a year and with a dollar dollar in less when it is to find the right right.
I think that's what you can change <unk> <unk>.
And that's the future may start to look at <unk>, now, the tree of evolution, <unk> the evolution of bacteria, <unk>, <unk> cells.
We are so <unk> by <unk> people.
Our purpose is to do in a way to try to try to try to try to try to try to <unk>.
First of all, I'm going to do you, the <unk> possible possible, some <unk> work, a new work that we took to <unk> a <unk> almost a year ago. This is <unk>.
It's a <unk> environment where you can <unk> is <unk> to local level that <unk> with a huge <unk> of data.
So, here we're seeing <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> images like we want.
And it doesn't matter how big much of information we see, how big big is these <unk> of data or the images.
Most of the <unk> <unk> <unk>, but this for example is a <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of the <unk>, and <unk> in the <unk> of 300 <unk>.
It doesn't do any difference because the only thing that <unk> the <unk> of a system like this is the number of <unk> on your screen in your <unk> moment. It's also a very <unk> architecture.
This is a book book, example of data, not images.
This is <unk> <unk> <unk>. Every <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk>.
And to <unk> that is just <unk> of images and not images, we can do something like this, to see that it's a real <unk> of the <unk>, not a picture.
It may be a little bit of a <unk> to read a book.
I'll not tell you.
This is a more <unk> example. It's a number of <unk>.
Every image is the beginning of a <unk>.
And it gives you really the <unk> and the <unk> experience of read the real <unk> version of a <unk> or a <unk>, which is for nature a half a half of a half.
We also did something with the corner of this particular number of this particular number of <unk>.
We created a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> much more <unk> than that you use in a normal <unk>, and we have <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk>, you can see here.
Or other models, or even the <unk> <unk>.
And this really <unk> some of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of space on the screen.
And I think this <unk> to put the <unk> and other <unk> like, they don't have to be <unk>.
Of course, the <unk> is one of the most <unk> <unk> for this kind of technology.
And on this is not going to <unk>, if you don't say we have <unk> by <unk> to give them in this field.
These are all the <unk> in the United States <unk> on a NASA <unk> picture.
So now I'm going to do something else.
This is actually <unk> by the web; you can <unk> to see.
It's a project called <unk>, which <unk> two different technologies.
One is <unk> and the other is a very interesting <unk> to the computer computer very interesting <unk>, one of the <unk> of Washington, with the help of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And it's <unk> in the web, <unk> by <unk>.
And you can <unk> when we do this kind of <unk>, where we can go from another another another <unk> of <unk>.
But the <unk> <unk> of images here has actually a meaning.
The <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> these images together, in a way that <unk> to <unk> places where the <unk> all <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> are <unk>. There are <unk> <unk>. And here here, here's a <unk> of one <unk> <unk> or <unk>, and these things are all these are all <unk> <unk> <unk>.
I don't know if I've got a few other environment.
There are some much more <unk>.
I want to go to one of the <unk> data <unk> of <unk> <unk> and this <unk> from a <unk> <unk> that we did for the first time, I'm going to show you what it is really the key behind this technology, the <unk> technology. And it's not <unk> as much as you're <unk> that we <unk> the website.
We had to <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>.
This is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> images of <unk>, other <unk> and <unk> and <unk> images of <unk> and saying. <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> an image that <unk> of this model.
So, I'm all <unk> images from <unk> and <unk> are all <unk> at the <unk> level of this way.
And it's possible to <unk> this way.
You know, I would never thought about it.
It's very <unk> <unk> this kind of <unk> here.
I think you can see that this is a lot of different kinds of <unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, a number of <unk>, <unk> number number, <unk>, <unk> number together in this environment.
And if I can, I <unk> to try to look at those <unk>.
Many are <unk> by <unk>, etc.
And a few of the here is a series of photographs -- <unk>.
This is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We can go from the <unk> to the physics of this environment.
The <unk> is that we can do things with social environment. This is now <unk> data from the whole <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> as <unk> the land, from the point of view of <unk> <unk> and <unk> all of the data together.
All those pictures become <unk> together, more than the <unk>.
You have a <unk> model of the earth that <unk>.
Think about this as the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> on Earth Earth.
It's something that <unk> in complexity, as people <unk> the <unk>, and the <unk> that <unk> for the <unk> of <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> are <unk> with <unk> <unk> by other people.
If someone is the idea of <unk> all these <unk> <unk> the name, my picture of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of all those data, and I can use it as a <unk> <unk> in space, using the picture of anyone, and using pictures of anyone, and have a social experience.
Of course, a <unk> of all this is <unk> models of every interesting part of the land, <unk> not only by <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> images and <unk> <unk>.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I realized? What do you know? What do you do is that at some point, in the next years, all of the <unk> <unk> from anyone in the the world's entire world's <unk> <unk>.
<unk>: Yes. What's doing is doing is actually <unk>.
It's creating <unk>, if you want, between images.
And it's doing this in the <unk> of images.
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the <unk> information information that a lot of these <unk> images.
As a <unk> of images on the web, you <unk> a <unk> and the <unk> page on the web has a lot of information about the pictures.
Now, what happens if that picture <unk> <unk> to all your picture?
So the amount of <unk> <unk> <unk> and the amount of <unk> that <unk> is a <unk> effect of the network.
CA: <unk>, is really amazing. <unk>.
<unk>: I'm going to be very much.
One of the main <unk> when you <unk> and one of the <unk> <unk> <unk> is the <unk> of <unk> <unk>, between who <unk> the <unk> <unk>, between the people who have the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> to think that <unk> <unk> <unk> still beyond the <unk> <unk>, or that the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, or <unk> <unk> <unk>, or <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, or <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, to remember the <unk> <unk> of <unk>, and that the idea that the idea that the world in which we're not just a sense, but it's just a sense of a sense of <unk>, but it's <unk>,
the <unk> of a particular <unk> of choices <unk> that our <unk> has done, well or bad, a lot of <unk> <unk>.
And, of course, everybody <unk> <unk> <unk>.
All <unk>. All <unk>.
We are <unk> to <unk> <unk>.
We need to <unk> the death of death, so we don't have to <unk> it --
We all have a art.
What <unk> is the <unk> <unk> of the song, the <unk> of <unk> every culture.
It doesn't matter that are the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, or the <unk> of <unk> <unk>, or the <unk> of <unk> <unk>, or the <unk> of <unk>, or a <unk> in the heart of the <unk>.
And he was my <unk> of a <unk> journey in the <unk> a month ago, or a <unk> of <unk> <unk>, the <unk> mother of <unk>, the <unk>'s mother of the world.
All of these <unk> <unk> us that there are other ways of <unk> other ways of <unk> other ways to move in the world.
And, if you <unk> a moment, is a concept that can give you hope.
<unk>, the <unk> of <unk> world create a <unk> of <unk> life and <unk> that <unk> the planet and <unk> the planet <unk>, and it's important for the <unk> <unk> as a <unk> <unk>.
And you can think about this <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and <unk> the <unk> of all the <unk>, <unk>, <unk> ideas, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> to be from the human <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the human <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> of <unk> of <unk> of <unk>
<unk> is <unk> <unk> of humanity.
It's the <unk> of what we are and what we can be in the species.
And <unk> the <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is success to <unk> and <unk> much more <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, for example, <unk> that 50 percent of all the species was or the <unk> of all the species was just <unk>, or -- in the <unk> of the <unk> diversity -- and you don't even even even even <unk> <unk> -- that's not <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> -- that that <unk> diversity -- that's that <unk> diversity.
The <unk> of all of this is, of course, the <unk> <unk>.
When you're <unk> <unk> <unk> on this planet.
One language is not just <unk> by a <unk> or a series of rules of rules.
One is the <unk> language of the human <unk>.
It's the middle with which the <unk> of every culture is in the world.
Every language is a forest of the mind, a <unk>, a <unk> thought, a <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
And of those <unk> <unk>, as we're sitting here at least half the <unk> is not more <unk> in the <unk> of children.
They're not more <unk> to children, which means, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
What's more <unk> of being <unk> by the <unk>, of being the last to talk about a language, the <unk> of <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of the children?
This <unk> <unk> is the state of someone in some part of the world every two weeks: every two weeks, a <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> the <unk> of a <unk> language.
And I know that someone of you <unk> "<unk>" <unk>'t it better?
The world would not be a better place if you <unk> all the same language? "<unk>, then we're going to be <unk>. <unk>.
<unk> <unk>.
<unk> a <unk> thing that means to be able to talk about their language.
Today, I'd like to give you a journey through the <unk> --
a little journey in the <unk> to give you a <unk> of what we're <unk>.
Many of us <unk> that when I say, "<unk> different ways of <unk>."
<unk> for example, this <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, the <unk> of <unk>, which <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's a <unk> that's not able to <unk> the color color from the green <unk> because the <unk> <unk> <unk> is <unk> in the <unk> time of the forest that <unk>.
They have a <unk> language language and a <unk> <unk>, "<unk> <unk>": you have to <unk> a different <unk>.
All of this has <unk> in the past <unk>, yet the <unk> is that in these families where they talk six or seven <unk> because of <unk> <unk> <unk> nobody <unk> language.
It's going to hear and then you're going to talk.
<unk> one of the most interesting <unk> with which I've lived, the <unk> of <unk> <unk>, a incredible <unk> that had the first <unk> in <unk>.
In <unk> five <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
They did <unk> from the top of the <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> that this <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> had never seen anything about <unk>.
They <unk> the picture from the earth, they <unk> to <unk> a shape or a form and <unk>, they don't know anything, they <unk> <unk> <unk>, and they <unk> the five <unk> with <unk>.
But the <unk> <unk> didn't only <unk> <unk>.
They're <unk> between them.
<unk> percent of <unk> <unk> was <unk> by their own.
We're <unk> eight <unk> and we found two cases of death and when we <unk> to know, they <unk> to know, they <unk> that one of them was <unk>, and then they <unk> it.
<unk> were able to recognize the animal <unk> from 40 <unk> and <unk> the species.
<unk> <unk>, I was <unk> a very interesting task when my <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> to me if I wanted to go to <unk> <unk> to <unk> the <unk> society to <unk> the <unk> society to <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to do <unk>.
For a sense of <unk>, I had to understand the <unk> culture and that <unk> is not <unk>.
It's pretty much about a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of the world.
Very interesting.
If you <unk> to <unk> the great <unk> of the world, what do I <unk>?
<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, etc.
A continent is always <unk> out, thinking that Africa has no other. And instead, yes, and then <unk> is not that the <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> during the the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk>.
What makes interesting is the <unk> is the <unk> relationship between life and death.
So <unk> <unk> do.
The <unk> can be <unk> by the <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
For this <unk> <unk> <unk> to say, "<unk> <unk> <unk>. You go to talk about God.
We <unk> in <unk> and <unk> God. "
And from the moment you're <unk>, is the spirit that you can <unk> it?
So, you're <unk> to these incredible events: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a rather <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> of the power of the mind when it's <unk> in a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> all the <unk> with which I lived the most <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, in <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that once <unk> on the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
In a continent of blood <unk>, this <unk> never been <unk> by <unk>.
At <unk> today are <unk> by a <unk>, but their <unk> is <unk>.
The young young <unk> are <unk> from families or four years, and they live in a world fact, they live in a <unk> world, and they live in <unk> <unk> for 18 years.
Two years of nine years, <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
For this time, they <unk> to values of their society, values that <unk> their <unk> and only their <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or to say <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or to say the <unk> <unk>.
And the <unk> of this incredible <unk>, they <unk> out and the first time in their age, at age of 18 years, see a <unk>. And in that moment of the first <unk>, when the sun <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, when the sun <unk> <unk> of the first <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>:
"<unk>? <unk> <unk> like I said.
It's <unk>. Now it's <unk>.
They call it <unk> <unk> and they say we, <unk> <unk>, we are the <unk> of the world.
This is extremely important.
When we think about the <unk> <unk> and the old <unk> <unk> <unk>, which is a concept of <unk> <unk>, which is a <unk> concept in his <unk> or maybe <unk> and <unk> and <unk>, and we say that these <unk> are more than us.
<unk> <unk> are not <unk> <unk> <unk>.
There's no space for these things in the <unk> <unk> or in the <unk> <unk> of <unk>, but because of time and <unk>, they created a <unk> of the Earth <unk> <unk> not on the concept of <unk> <unk> <unk>, but on a <unk> <unk> <unk>, but on a <unk> <unk>, the concept that the Earth can live in the human <unk>.
What does it mean?
<unk> to say that a <unk> of <unk> <unk> that the mountain is a <unk> <unk> that <unk> its <unk> is a human being <unk> <unk>. And it's going to be a different <unk>, or that <unk> <unk> to a <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> a mountain of <unk> that <unk> that <unk> a mountain is a <unk> to be.
That's the <unk> of one <unk> <unk> is <unk>.
What is interesting is the <unk> that <unk> the relationship between the <unk> and the natural world.
I grew up in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that the <unk> <unk> to be <unk>.
That <unk> me to be a different human being different than my friends who believe that <unk> are the <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> that they live in the <unk> <unk> of the world, <unk> that <unk> during the <unk> <unk>.
If you're going to <unk> that these <unk> can actually create different <unk>, <unk> to understand some of their <unk> <unk>. <unk> this <unk>.
I <unk> this picture at <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Maybe some of you've heard about the <unk>, the most powerful <unk> of the <unk> <unk>.
What makes the <unk> is not the <unk> potential of the <unk>, but her <unk>. It's <unk> by two elements.
So, the side, this <unk> <unk> that has a series of <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
<unk> the only <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> a little bit of the <unk>, but it's <unk> with the <unk> of a family of <unk> <unk> said.
This <unk> <unk> <unk>, very similar to the <unk>, <unk>.
If you're going to be <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> the <unk> that they do a different <unk> of species, <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> that <unk> on the <unk> is a little bit like <unk> <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a sea of electricity. <unk>'t make a <unk> of the reality of the reality of the reality of reality.
<unk> <unk>, Richard <unk> <unk>, the man who <unk> <unk> <unk>, the man who <unk> was <unk>, with his discovery of <unk> <unk> in the '<unk>.
My <unk> is not <unk> these <unk> as <unk> because if you're done, you can't tell anybody anybody to be <unk>. <unk>] [<unk>]] <unk>]] <unk>. They can't be <unk> <unk> because they are <unk> by a <unk> that is, of course, in the <unk> <unk>.
It's possible to <unk> only if you <unk> with other <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk>.
Now it's the beautiful: the <unk> that are <unk> in this <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk>. The question is the <unk> <unk>. The question is <unk> <unk>: in a <unk> of <unk> species of plants, like these <unk> to <unk> two <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. <unk> <unk>?
We use the great <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk>, which can <unk> <unk>.
But if you <unk> to the <unk>, we <unk> "<unk>" <unk> "<unk>" <unk> "."
What does it mean?
This <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, which <unk> <unk> <unk> in the forest, and that our eyes <unk> in the same species.
If you <unk> how to <unk> their <unk> <unk> us, "<unk> <unk> of plants, the rest of plants, the rest of the <unk>, I said," No. "
The solution is: you take the <unk> <unk> in a night of moon and <unk> <unk> with a different <unk>.
With this not <unk> <unk>, but it's much more interesting that <unk> the <unk>.
Now, [<unk>]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]
In fact, the <unk> century, <unk>, not <unk> <unk> for his <unk> or his <unk> <unk>, but rather as the <unk> <unk>, but rather as the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of diversity and <unk> of the <unk> diversity and <unk> of the planet. Now the problem is not the change.
All the <unk> through the <unk> were <unk> in a <unk> to new <unk> of new <unk>.
And the problem is not technology.
<unk> <unk> don't have <unk> to be <unk> when they put out of the <unk> and <unk> like the <unk> don't have <unk> to be <unk> when they put them from <unk> and <unk>.
It's not the change or technology that <unk> the <unk> of <unk>. It's the power.
The <unk> <unk> of <unk>.
And if you look at a <unk> <unk> to the world, <unk> that these are not <unk> <unk> to <unk>.
They're <unk> <unk> and <unk> out of the <unk> forces that they go beyond their <unk> <unk>.
<unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> --
a <unk> <unk> <unk>, in <unk> <unk>, a <unk> that has been <unk> in the forest to a generation ago, and now <unk> to the <unk> and the <unk> <unk>, where you can see the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, where it seems to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk>,
We started to <unk> the <unk> with the <unk> <unk> to the forest.
Or, in the case of <unk>, are the disease that are <unk> with the discovery of <unk>.
If you <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, where I'm doing a lot of research, you'll see the <unk> <unk> of politics.
As <unk> <unk>, the <unk> physics of a <unk>, is <unk> to <unk> level, but the <unk>, the <unk> of the <unk> of a <unk>, not only <unk>, but <unk> <unk> <unk> in some <unk> of development.
And you can't understand the <unk> of the <unk> until you're not <unk> from the beginning.
I <unk> the <unk> miles from <unk> in China through the <unk> <unk>, <unk> to <unk> with a young <unk>, but it just <unk> to <unk> me. I realized what's behind.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> million people <unk> from the <unk> <unk> during the <unk> <unk>.
The father of this guy was <unk> to the <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> that means that was <unk> to the Chinese times.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> during the <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk>.
My mother was <unk> and his <unk> was <unk>.
It was <unk> to <unk> at the age of two years <unk> under his <unk> <unk>, because it would not live without him.
The <unk>, who did the same, was <unk> in the <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> a day <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> and, this <unk>, was <unk> to the work for seven years.
The pain of <unk> can be <unk>, but the spirit of the <unk> <unk> is from <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And then, everything <unk> up to a choice.
<unk> to live in the <unk> world or we want to <unk> the <unk> world of diversity?
The great <unk> <unk> <unk>, before they're going to die said that his biggest <unk> was that, in our <unk> <unk> <unk> of the world, not only <unk> the whole <unk> of the human imagination to a <unk> <unk> of the human imagination, but a day we would have a <unk> that were other possibility.
And it's <unk> to remember that our species is <unk> for <unk> years.
The <unk> <unk>, that has given us, agriculture, which has done us to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with the <unk> of <unk>, creating the <unk> of <unk>, creating <unk> <unk> of <unk>, creating <unk> <unk> of <unk>, creating the <unk> of <unk>, creating years ago.
The <unk> world has been <unk> 300 years.
That <unk> story, I didn't know that <unk> the challenges that we <unk> to all the challenges that we can get the challenges that we can get the answers to the <unk>.
When these <unk> of <unk> <unk> world is asked what you want to be human, <unk> with <unk> <unk> different <unk>.
And it's in these answers that we all <unk> the chance of being what we are: a species, that has to be a <unk>, that has to be <unk>. And there are big moments of <unk>.
I <unk> this picture on the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>, when I went to <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk> with <unk>, and this man, <unk> me <unk> me the wonderful story of his <unk>.
The government <unk> is not always <unk> with the <unk> <unk> and the '<unk> for 50 to <unk> our <unk>, we <unk> them in <unk>.
The <unk> of this man <unk> <unk>.
The family, <unk> for her life, <unk> all the <unk> <unk>, and all of his <unk>.
You know, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk>.
The <unk> of <unk> <unk> were <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> of this man didn't <unk> by night or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> in your hand. When I did it <unk>, <unk>, <unk> has <unk> <unk>, <unk>, he has <unk> by <unk>,
He <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk> of <unk> <unk>, and when <unk> <unk>, <unk> a dog.
He <unk> the dog and created a <unk>, with the <unk> <unk> created a <unk>, has created another dog, and it's <unk> on the <unk>, <unk> of <unk> in <unk>.
<unk> to talk about <unk>? [<unk>]] And that, in different ways, [<unk>]]] is the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of the world.
<unk> <unk> <unk> government <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> of a <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
It's their new <unk>. It's called <unk>.
It's a <unk> <unk>. <unk> all the <unk> resources.
One <unk> example of how a <unk> can <unk> with his <unk>.
And, to end, I think it's rather <unk> at least who we have been in these <unk> <unk> of the planet, <unk> that that they're not <unk> at all.
For someone is.
<unk> <unk> of the human imagination that <unk> at the <unk> of the time. And for us, the dreams of these children, they become part of the <unk> of the hope of the hope of the hope of hope.
For course, we <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, we've never been <unk> at anything.
<unk> that <unk> --
[<unk>]]] are not <unk>, but we believe that stories can change the world, and maybe we are the best to tell stories of the world. Every month our <unk> <unk> <unk> million <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> our <unk> <unk>.
Our <unk> are <unk> by millions of people.
Our work is <unk> in <unk> to bring our audience in <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> from which <unk> <unk> from which <unk> <unk> <unk> as the <unk> and <unk>, <unk>, the <unk> world, the <unk> world of <unk> <unk>: the <unk> world of <unk> in <unk> diversity, and we have to find a <unk> <unk> life.
where the <unk> of all the <unk> can <unk> our <unk>.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope you've heard and <unk> some <unk>, in the case, you don't <unk> them.
I want to start with what I call the <unk> <unk>. "
<unk> <unk> of what?
The <unk> <unk> of all <unk> society <unk> <unk> <unk>: "If we want to <unk> the <unk> of our citizens" The way to do it is <unk> to do it is <unk>. "
The reason is, from one side, in fact that the freedom is <unk>, <unk> for human beings.
<unk> is in fact that if we're <unk>, each of us can act to do everything that <unk> our <unk>, without no one that <unk> our <unk>, without no one <unk> in our name.
The way to <unk> the freedom is to <unk> choice.
The most choices are, more <unk> are <unk>, and more is their freedom, more is their <unk>.
This is <unk>, <unk>, is so <unk> <unk> in society that nobody <unk> <unk> in <unk>.
And it's also <unk> <unk> in our lives.
I'll show you some examples of what the progress has made.
This is my <unk>. It's not particularly big.
I <unk> a simple <unk> on the <unk> for <unk>.
In my <unk> <unk>, there are <unk> <unk>, without <unk> the 10 <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that you can buy for <unk> number of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> that you can buy one number of <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Here's what the <unk>.
Then you go to the <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk>: <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
And in this single <unk> <unk>, there's a big number of <unk> <unk>.
We can make six million of different <unk> using the <unk> that there are a <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> that there is <unk> choice.
<unk> <unk>: The world of <unk>.
<unk>, when I was a child, they could get all the <unk> services, <unk> <unk> that were <unk> by <unk> <unk>.
They <unk> the phone, you don't get it.
One of that, between the other, was that the phone never <unk>.
These times they went.
We now have a <unk> almost <unk> of <unk> <unk>, especially between the phones.
Here's the <unk> cell future.
My <unk> is the <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> of the <unk>, and <unk> for the <unk> <unk>.
If you're not <unk> the <unk> <unk> in the house under the house under the house, you're going to be <unk>.
And what's the end happens is that people <unk> <unk> in the <unk> and do this question. And you know, is the answer? The answer is, "No."
It's not possible to buy a cell cell phone, not <unk> things.
So, in other things of life that are much more important than the <unk>, <unk> the same <unk> of choices.
<unk> <unk>: <unk>'t happen in the United States that you're going to be <unk> <unk> and the <unk> you need to do.
Instead, <unk> from <unk>, and the <unk> says, "OK, we might do it, or <unk>," <unk>, "<unk>" <unk> "<unk> <unk>," <unk> <unk>, "<unk> <unk>," <unk> <unk>, "<unk> <unk>," <unk> <unk>, "<unk> <unk>," <unk> <unk>, "<unk> <unk>," <unk> <unk>, "<unk>," <unk>, "<unk>," <unk> <unk>
You know, you know, what do you do? "
And the <unk> says, "<unk> is," <unk> these <unk> and these <unk>, and <unk> <unk> these <unk>. "
"What do you want to do?"
And you say, "<unk> if you were, what do you know?
And the <unk>: I'm not her. "
The result we call it "<unk> <unk>", "<unk> that makes it a beautiful thing.
But actually, it's not that one <unk> the <unk> and responsibility to take decisions by somebody who knows something, <unk> the <unk>, <unk> the <unk>, to <unk> that's not <unk> -- and so not in <unk> <unk>, and so not in <unk> <unk> for the patient.
There's a huge <unk> of <unk> products, <unk> to people like me, and you, that if you think it has no sense, because we can't <unk>.
But if we can't <unk>, why do we <unk> them?
The answer is that they want to <unk> <unk> to <unk> the <unk> <unk>.
<unk> of so fundamental as the <unk> of how we've got a question of choice, like you see in this <unk>. "We don't want to <unk> the children. They're not going to be <unk>. We have to <unk>.
And we can <unk> us as many times.
The means that every <unk>, you have to <unk>, you have to decide that kind of person being.
<unk> to the family and to the <unk>, a <unk> <unk> of the common perspective, <unk> of anyone, was that <unk> the most soon soon as possible.
The only real choice was with who, not when, and even what do after.
<unk>, all is really to play.
They're going to students very smart, and they <unk> their 20 percent in less work.
And it's not because they're less <unk>, not because they're less <unk>.
But why are I <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> or not? <unk> <unk> or not?
"<unk> <unk> <unk> later? I have to think before the children or to career?
They're <unk> <unk>.
And they try to answer these questions, even though this <unk> <unk>, even though this <unk> <unk>, and they don't get a <unk> <unk> to my <unk>.
And they have to do it. They're important questions.
Now, the work: we're <unk>, like <unk> <unk> <unk>, because technology allows us to work every day, every day, from every corner of the planet, <unk> that from the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, there is a <unk>, and I'm not going to say, where the <unk> works.
I'm not saying, because I want to use it.
What does, this mean, this incredible freedom to do that we have about work? It's we have to decide, <unk> in every moment, if we have to work or not.
We can go to see our son to <unk>, with the <unk>, the <unk> in a <unk>, the <unk> in the other, and the <unk>, <unk>, on the <unk>.
And if I'm all <unk>, every minute that we see our <unk> <unk>, we're also <unk>, "I have to answer this?
"I have to <unk> this <unk>? I have to <unk> this letter?
And when the answer is, "no," is not, "all this is the experience of your son very different than that it would be in other conditions.
So, from any part of the look, small and big things, life is a question of choices.
And once the world was this <unk>: <unk>, there were some chance, but not everything was a question of choice.
The world of today <unk> to this: <unk> is, "That's a <unk> thing, or <unk>?
The answer is <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> them all, so I'm going to talk about the <unk>.
<unk> this choice two actually <unk> on people.
The first, <unk>, is that <unk> <unk> <unk>.
With a lot of <unk> between what they need, it becomes very difficult to do it.
I'm going to give you a <unk> <unk>: a study study on <unk> <unk> <unk>.
A <unk> of my <unk> has been <unk> to the <unk> data, the <unk> society, with about a million <unk> <unk> in different <unk> companies.
What she found her is that for every 10 solutions that are <unk> in more, the <unk> of <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> two percent.
With 50 <unk> <unk>, there's 10 percent in less than <unk> than <unk> when they're <unk> only five to be <unk>. Why?
Because with 50 <unk> <unk> of what you need, is <unk> difficult to decide, and the choice is <unk>.
And <unk>, and again, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and of course, <unk>, <unk>, and of course, <unk>, <unk>, and of course, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>,
<unk> that doesn't mean that these <unk> <unk> <unk> food for <unk> <unk> because they don't have enough money, they want to say that the decision is so <unk> that they also <unk> <unk> <unk> of work.
They're not <unk>, they're <unk> to five <unk> <unk> <unk> for the year of work, that it would be <unk> to <unk> <unk>.
So the <unk> is a <unk> of <unk> to have choices.
And I think that <unk> the world so.
"And for the end, for <unk>: <unk>, <unk> or <unk>?
<unk> <unk> to take the right decision, if it's the <unk>, it?
You don't want to choose the wrong wrong, and <unk> the wrong <unk>.
So this is the first effect. The second is that even though we can <unk> <unk> <unk> and do a choice, the end of the end of the <unk> of how <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of how to choose.
And this for different reasons.
One of these is that with a lot of <unk> between which, if you have one and not perfect, it's easy to imagine that <unk> to be a different choice that would be better. And that's going on that happens is that the <unk> <unk> <unk> us to <unk> to <unk> <unk> of choice, and the <unk> <unk> <unk> from <unk>,
And when it was a <unk> decision.
<unk>, there are more choices is <unk> of any <unk> that <unk> is <unk> of <unk>.
<unk>, there is what <unk> call.
Dan <unk> has <unk> very well as the value that we give things from what we give things from what we <unk>.
<unk>, when there are a lot of <unk> possible, is easy to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> that is choice.
Here's a example. I <unk> with all the people who are not in New York.
But that's what you probably do.
There's this <unk> to the <unk>.
A place of <unk>.
<unk> <unk>. <unk> day. It's all about them.
Don't <unk> anything. But what he think he's said, "Well, <unk>, <unk>, it's <unk>."
"All my <unk> <unk> <unk>."
"<unk> <unk> right in front of the home."
And it's two weeks from the idea that's <unk> -- every day -- the chance of <unk> where you want.
The <unk> <unk> <unk> for what we have, even when choice was <unk>.
And the more is the <unk> that we have <unk>, the more <unk> <unk> <unk> us to do.
Here's another example.
This <unk> tells us a lot of things.
It's about the <unk> moment, and maybe a live live slowly.
But the most important thing is that you're going to be <unk>, you're going to do not do other.
The things that we don't have a lot of <unk> that we do.
<unk> <unk> <unk>.
I tried to my skin <unk> a new <unk>.
<unk> always <unk>.
<unk> <unk> were <unk>, <unk> were <unk>, <unk> and <unk> <unk>, were <unk>, only after <unk>, they were <unk>, only after <unk> a life and <unk> a lot of times, they were <unk>, and they were <unk>.
So, I went to <unk> a couple of new when the <unk> were <unk>, and I said, "I need a couple of <unk>, this is my <unk>."
<unk> said, "Do you want to <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>?"
You want them to <unk> or with <unk>? "<unk>" <unk> "?
"Do you want to <unk>?"
"<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>? <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>? <unk> <unk> <unk> --"
I was <unk>, and after a little <unk>, I was a little bit of <unk>, which was the only one guy, "I had no idea. It was so for a <unk> <unk> <unk>, and then <unk> <unk>, <unk>, with the <unk>, <unk>, with the <unk>, <unk>, with the <unk>, with the best of the best <unk> that I had ever <unk>.
It was the <unk>. With all that choice had <unk> the best.
But I'm going to do it.
Why? I wrote a whole book for <unk>.
The reason I was worse is that with all that choice my <unk> were <unk>, the <unk> <unk> to be <unk>.
At the beginning I had <unk> <unk>. I didn't know anything about when I was a kind of <unk>, but when we had 100 different <unk>, <unk>, at least one, a <unk> had to be perfect.
What I had to <unk> was good, but not perfect.
After <unk> what I was <unk> with what I was <unk> in <unk> to the <unk>.
The <unk> of <unk> <unk> in life, not <unk> <unk> that <unk> the <unk> that these <unk> are <unk>.
And this <unk> less <unk>, even when the results are good.
No one in the <unk> world, it makes it.
Because if you <unk> it, I don't know what I'm talking about.
The truth is more to this.
"It was better when he was worse worse than the reason he was going to do it was worse than when he was worse than worse than <unk>.
<unk>, in the world that we live in -- <unk> citizens with the <unk> of <unk> -- the <unk> that we can <unk> is that things are <unk> to the <unk>.
You've never never <unk> <unk> because your <unk>, my <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> of happiness -- what you're here -- is, "<unk> <unk>" Yes, "Yes," Yes, "Yes, you want."
I mean, small moment -- I'm really <unk>, I'm really <unk>, my wife is <unk>.
I couldn't do it better, I didn't have <unk> me.
But <unk> doesn't always have a <unk> thing.
<unk>, a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> when there's just that kind of <unk> is that when you're not <unk>, and you're going to tell you, and you say, "Why?
"Who is <unk>?" "" "" <unk> is <unk>.
The world is the <unk>. What could I do?
When there are hundreds of <unk>, and they <unk> a <unk>, and they <unk> a <unk>, and you know who <unk>, is <unk> that the <unk> is <unk> that the <unk> you.
They could do better.
With hundreds of <unk> available, there are no <unk> for <unk>.
So when people take decisions, even though the result is <unk>, they <unk> <unk> and <unk> them to their same.
In the last years, the <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> world.
I think a <unk> <unk> -- not the only one, but important -- of this <unk> of <unk> is that people have <unk> <unk> experience because the <unk> are too <unk>.
And when they have to <unk> this situation think that <unk> is.
So the final result is that we're better, <unk>, but we'll <unk> worse.
<unk> you.
This is the <unk> <unk>, what we all do for good and it's completely <unk>. It's not true.
There's no <unk> that a little bit of choice is better than <unk>, but it's not <unk> that much choice is better than a little bit better.
There's a value <unk>, <unk>. I don't know what.
But I'm sure we've <unk> from a piece of the level of the level that the choices <unk> our life.
Now, from the point of view <unk> -- I've been <unk> -- from the <unk> <unk> is the <unk>.
What you can <unk> this choice in <unk> society is the <unk> material.
There are many places in the world, and you have <unk> <unk>, where the problem is not they have <unk> choice.
The problem is that they have too <unk>.
So, the <unk> that I'm talking about is a <unk> <unk> of <unk>, <unk> society.
And what it does <unk> and <unk> is this: <unk> <unk> <unk> you talked about how those <unk> and <unk> <unk> to <unk> are <unk>. It's a <unk> of money.
I mean that these choices, <unk> and <unk>, is not that they're just <unk>.
They're <unk> <unk>.
They do it <unk>.
If a little bit of what in our society allows us to <unk> choice was <unk> in those people have too few chance, it would be <unk>, but also our life to be <unk>, but also our own.
This is what <unk> call a <unk> <unk>.
A <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>. They're not only to the poor people -- because of this choice in <unk> that <unk> us.
And to end: "<unk>, you can become all the things you want to --
<unk>, people of culture, <unk>: What do you know that fish do that fish? "
"It's <unk> that you can't do anything in a glass <unk>."
"A <unk> <unk> <unk>, a <unk> <unk> <unk> of the world --
and I <unk> it. I <unk> it, at the beginning.
But then, <unk>, I realized that that fish knows that that fish knows that fish knows.
Because the reality of the fact of the fact, if you <unk> the <unk> <unk>, in the way that you can't <unk> the freedom.
If you <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> so that everything you can <unk> the <unk>.
<unk> the <unk>, and <unk> the <unk>.
They all need a <unk>.
This is almost <unk> too <unk>, maybe even for the fish, and it <unk> for us.
But the <unk> of some <unk> <unk> is a <unk> for <unk> and, <unk>, for <unk>.
Thank you very much.
