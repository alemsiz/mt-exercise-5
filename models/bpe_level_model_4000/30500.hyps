Last year, I showed these slides to demonstrate that the heat the heat the artical heat at that almost three million years has had the size of 48 United States is the continental continental continental continental continental --
But this undervalue the gravity of the problem because it doesn't show the ice of the ice of the ice problem because it doesn't show the ice of the ice of the problem because it doesn't show you as a ice of the problem because it doesn't show you as a ice of the problem because it doesn't show you as a ice as it doesn't show the ice of the problem because it doesn't show the ice of the problem because it doesn't show the ice of
The artical heat at is is, in a sense, the clear heart of the global climate system.
It expand in the winter and return it into the summer.
The next slide is going to be a quick dear on the last 25 years.
The ice lost ice loss are signed in red.
As you see, they expand they expand it up to the blue blue blue.
That's the ice in the winter, which is return into the summer.
You can see that the so-called the sea ice of five years or more, it's like the blood here is from the body.
In 25 years has been from like this, at this way.
This is a problem because the heat care of the ice of the ice around the ocean artic ocean where there are huge carbon on on on as the micro-dealing -- that is a dealing with the microbes.
In the total pollution of the pollution of global warming, that amount of global warming, that amount of it may double this point of not return to back.
In some deep in Alaska little deep in Alaska is already reboiling from water.
The professorse Katey Walter of the University of Alaska was recking-grab slow.
Video: Wow! Al Gore: She is good. The question is if we're also going to be us.
A reason is that this termal exchange from the Greenland from the northermal of the north.
This is a glacial record.
The laughed has never reached level.
This is the Kangerlussuaq, in the Southwest of Groenland.
If you want to know how to know how to do the sea ice of ice to the ground -- and it's where the sea.
These currents are increasing rapidly.
On the other side of the planet.
The last month of scientists have declaim that the ice of the ice is in negative, and the Western Antarctica, which is very quickly in some island, is particularly quickly in some of the basic iss.
Equival at six feet of water, like in Groenland,
Sull'Himalaya, the third largest blocking, you see new laghi, and they see new silliants.
The world's population report half the pounds of the pool.
Sulle Ande: This ice is the founds of the water found.
The laughed is increasing.
But when it decreases it comes to the water.
In California snow on the Sierra Nevada is 40-percent of the snow is 40-percent
Midrices are in crisis.
Sorvisions, as you have, are grave.
The growing security in the world door a remarkable increase of the preended.
The disaster's disasters are increasing a rhythm and without previous previous previous and without previous previous precend.
Four times more numbers in the last 30 years than the previous 75.
This is a whole whole whole insustainable of all insustainable of this is an insustain.
If you look in the history context if you can see the consequences as well.
In the last five years we added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the ocean every day.
Look at the East of the Eastern Eastern Amer, in the west, and both the parts of the subject of the continent, where there's a radical impoor of the ocean impoor in the ocean --
The greatest cause of global warming, with deforestation, which is 20 percent of the deforestation, which is the use of fossil fuels.
OOn is a problem, and the carbon is even worse --
The United States are one of the most emissions, with China.
And he proposed to build many other kinds of carbon central other carbon central central of the other carbon central other central central central central of other carbon central other things.
But we're seeing a way to a direction.
These are the projects annulled in the last few years and some evidence.
Anyway, there's a political lots in our country.
The carbon industry and oil industry has spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promoting carbon clean clean oxymore.
And that image I reminded something --
Very Nata, in Tennessee, where I live -- there's been a 3.8 billion gallons of carbon dishs.
Maybe you see it on the news of news newspapers.
This is the second largest flow of scories in America.
It happened around Nat.
The natalization of one of the carbon industry was this.
Video: Frosty coallies is a kind of allist and happy.
It's abundant here in America, and it grow our economy.
Frosty the carbonaio is increasingly more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and clean.
It's a good price, adorable and the workers are actually sending the stock.
Al Gore: From here is a lot of the West Virginia.
The largest department society on the mountains is Massey Coal. This is his minister.
Video: Don Blankenship: I'm going to be clear -- Al Gore, Nancy Reid -- they don't know what they're talking about.
Al Gore: So the Alleance for the Clim Proteon Clima has launched two campaigns.
This is a part of it, a party.
Video: Actually, we can see the climate changes like a nightful change as a nightful deep to our business.
So this is a very priority to invest a great amount of money in a publicist sweeping public and consuming and consuming the fuel of carbon truth and consummition to carbon on dioxide of the money in a spatic effort to make a lot of money in a sprange of money in a
In fact, carbon is not spore.
We think it's cleaning -- it has a good profume.
So not preocure of climate change.
Let me do us.
Video: Ate: Carbon -- you heard a lot of you heard a lot of it.
So let's do it a kind of avanian avanian to be a clean as a clean carbon on --
Straordinary cars. The machines are a little noisy of clean!
The carbon consumer is in the main cause, global warming, but the remarkable technology that you see it changes everything.
Take a look at this is the odiern of the clean fuel of cleaning fuel.
Al Gore: Infinally, the positive alternative to the economic issues to the economic issue.
Video: Comment: America, it's crisi; the national security of national security crisis.
The file that the lines all of the fossil fuels of fossil fuels and oil and oil oil oil and import.
Now, yet, there's a new solution to uscircles.
Rear America: 100 percent of clean energy in 10 years.
A plan to re-America, to do a more several warming.
Finally, a solution that you basts to solve our problems.
Rear America. Scover the more.
Al Gore: This is the last one.
Video: Complente: It's about returing energy to America.
One of the fastest ways of door finally dependence that we have to kill our planet.
Comparsa: The future is here. Vently, sole, sole, a new energy network.
Comparate is 2: Novi investments for very well retribes.
Compent America. It's time to be realists.
Al Gore: A old proverbial proverbial of African says, "If you want to go speed by money,
If you want to go far far away, you go together."
We have to go far far speed.
Thank you very much.
Last year at TED I got a introduction on the LHC.
And I promises of switch to go back to how the machine.
So here I have. And for those that the other time we don't have to be -- the biggest scientific experiment, and the most of scientific experiment, 27 kilometers of circumstance.
Her job is to reach the conditions that were less than a billions of a second from the beginning of the universe -- until 600 million a second.
This is just the environment.
This is the car under Ginevra.
We Fotographic min-Big in the relevel.
This is what I work. It's called ATLAS -- it's largege-like like like 122 feet.
This is an ATLATLAS in construction so you can see the proportion of the proportion of ATLATLAS in construction so you can see the proportion of ATLAS in conconstruction so you can see the proportion of ATLATLATLA
We have the 10 secember of last year we have accurate the machine for the first time.
And this picture was taken by ATLAS
It was because of a meeting in the room room in control.
It's a picture of the first of particles that had done around the LHC, and in the LHC, and deliberately, with a part of the LHC, and spreads particles into the relevel.
In other words, when we saw that image the 10 secember, we knew that the machine that the machine that is a great living.
I don't know if it was this to do more opposition, or that, when somebody went on Google and saw that the initial page was this.
That means that we have a cultural impact beyond scientific impact.
About a week, I had a problem with the machine, it had to these files here -- these sleeping files here -- these sleeping files.
These files are 13,000 prints when the machine works at the massive device.
Now, the technicians in you look at the files and say, "That's not true. I'm filming too underlying it is."
And instead can do it because when they're very cosident to become the superconductors.
So, at least 271 degrees a degrees that of the space between the stars, these files can bring that current.
In one of the junctures between the LHC, there was a fabrication.
So the files are going to read read and 13,000 suddenly met a suddenly met a electrical resistance.
This was the result.
Now, this is even more impressive if you think that these magnetic fishing for 20 tons of the hones, and that have been moving from about 30 centimeters.
They were damaged about 50 magnets.
We had to take them to take them to reach them, what we did.
We have repristinated and upside and upside them.
Now they're coming back to their place underground.
I go to the end of the LHC is going to be new inteam.
And we would like it and we expect to get the right data to get the right data or him, and keep our adventure to find out what the morning is the morning, which is the morning, which is the universe.
Now, of course, in a way, these return accidents the debate of science and science and engineering frontier.
I think that the fact that it's so difficult to go beyond the limitations of things like LHC.
I want to end with the words of an Inglese scientist English, Humphrey Davy, the guy, the defense of the inutilium of his pupill, his pupill, his pupill, and he said, "No is so dangerous for human mind, as the report of human mind, as the repent of the definitely definitive to the progress are definitely definitely not new mone,"
Thank you.
I want to start to ask you to think about when you have a kid, you play the courage in the morning.
While you get to reach them as to achieve and grab them, and you learn them to think and solve problems, and actually sold problems and resold the space.
The spacecraft is deeply connected to the way we understand the world around us.
So, by an inspired by inspired by the useful of our interaction with physical objects. And I started to my Patti, and my Jevan Kalanithi, I started asking ourselves, and I started asking "And if we use a computer, instead of having the only digital demouse as a digital polrelly that will die of a digital polredramatically to be to do with ently an information with entles,
and to be it to be our pleasure.
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer, building the answer, building the Siftable.
In a few words, a Siftable computer is a great interactive like a biscout.
In a few words, a Siftable computer is a great interactive like a biscout.
You can move with your handle can see their motion between them, feel their movement and they have a screen and have a wireless radio wireless and a wireless radio wireless --
But most of course, they're physical, like the morning, as the morning, they can just move it just by grab to just take it to be just grabbing.
The Siftable is an example of a new ecosystem for a new ecosystem.
And as they become more physics, you know, you know about the movement, and as they become more physics, and as they become more physics, and as they become more physical, others, as we diovid, we can explore new and different stils stils stildly interaction.
I'm going to start with some simple example.
This Siftable is configurated to show of vide: if you include it in a direction, the video will rotate that it will rotes, if you include from the other hand, in the other side back.
These interactive portraits are conscious conscious portraits of other people.
If you grab them in their own own what they are intororous.
If they come circums, they can remarkable a little bit.
If they come circums, they can remarkable a little bit.
They also have their movement and unlination.
We then realized that one of the interesting interesting implications of the interaction was the common to the data, to be a color as if it was a liquid.
In this case, we have three Siftable configured as a greeter dry and I can use them to versate the color in that central color in that central color in that case, where they miles.
and I can use them to switch it to be to sweep.
If we can get too too much to put a little place.
There are also good possibility of learning as languages, the mathematics and mathematics and the logical things where people can try to do speed things and see the results of the results of the accomplishment and see the results of the logical things that people can try to do the speed things and see the results of the logic and the logical things that are can provide
Now I'm --
This is a Redwoom for Fibonaccount program.
Here we have a game of words that is in the Scarabeo and Boggle.
Basically, at every turnd, I got a letter on every Siftable, Prically, every turnally, turns, and I get a letter to go on to Siftable, and while you try to make a dictionary.
And then after about 30 seconds remissing, and you have a new set of letters and new possibility.
Thank you.
Here's what children were in the Media Lab, I did in the Media Lab, I did it and I walk a video of it.
They are very pleasure.
And one of the interesting things of this kind of application is that you don't have to give you a lot of educations.
You just have to say, "Compions of word," and they know exactly what to do.
Here's what other people who are trying to do it.
This is our beta youngest head of the youngest better,
It just wanted to be able to get larlap.
They were just morning, for him.
Now, this is an interactive cardboard application --
We wanted to build a tool for the learning of the Lui is Felix.
It can put new characters in the scene, satisslying the Siftable to get their associated with it.
It can put new characters in the scene, satisslying the Siftable to get their associated with it.
So, it's doing the sun of the sun --
Video: The sun is surgence.
David Merrill: Now it has taken a treator in the scene.
Video: The arancient treatment.
Bel job! Yes!
So if you save the Siftable and put it close to the characters --
Video: Bau!
-- by inventing your history.
Video: Hi,
DM: It's a story with the opening, and it can decide he as you we.
DM: It's a story with the opening, and it can decide he as you we.
Video: Gola via, junce.
DM: The last example I have time to show you is a tool that I have time to do recently get sampling and execececuttering and exececececutterly
it's a very recently made recently recently recently to sampling and executting music.
Siftable here act sounds like low-basis and bacteria --
Every one of these has four different variations, and you can choose what to use.
You can put these sound sounds in a sequence to get to your pleasure.
And I just modify it just making a sound and a "sequence."
These are actually actually you can control of live, like the file.
You attacks to a particular sound and then fiflies to fix it.
And then there are general as time and flouous, like time and flighting it to the sequence.
Look at how it works.
Video: DM: We will try to put a basic in two Siftable "sequenc," we can put it in a serie, we add other low.
Now I put a bunch line of low.
DM: DM: Now I add some percent of the --
Video: DM: And now I'm going to put the bacteria, so I can control the sad from the live.
DM: I can speak the whole whole sequence with a slate or from the other than the time from a side or from the other.
Video: DM: And now I'm going to add the lower to get more expression.
Video: DM: I can recombined the sequence "flight."
So I don't have to plan before, but I can sudden, make a longer or more cord.
And now, finally, I can sfummmmmale the left the Siftable to the left the Siftable "volume."
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is to build new interfaces more of the way our brain works, and more similarly like our brain and body.
And today, I had time to show you one of the results, and even some possibilities that we try to get out of the lab of the lab of the lab of the lab of the lab --
The concept I want to turn you is that it's coming this new generation of the design of the design design of interacting with digital media in our world in the way we want to do it.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the time to talk to all of you.
I'm a writer.
From books is my profession but it's more than that, of course, but it's more than that, of course,
It's also love and the fall of my life.
And I don't expect that it can change.
But I said that something particularly happened in my life and my career, who was really successful in my life and my career, which led me to this work.
The particular thing is I recently recently said this book, this biography called "Mangia, Prega, Ama," the which, which is different from my books, for some reasoning of the world and became a great sense-interaction.
And the result is that wherever go from now, people are treating me as if I was conviction.
It's really -- condnurdered -- convicat!
They all are now concerned to me and they say, "Do you don't have fear you can't do better than doing better.
Do you don't keep writing for all the whole life without being able to be able to create a book that can take somebody?"
that can care about someon?"
It's rassicurant, you know, you know.
But it could go worse the worse, at the time I remember that more than 20 years ago, when I started to say to people -- I was a training -- I was a writing.
I was in the same reaction of the same reaction as well.
And people said, "Don't you have succeed?
Do you don't fear that the humiliation kill?
You don't have fear to do this mestior to do this mestide and die on a cumulation of samp samp of the bank with the mouthwising bats with the mestior to love with fail?"
So, you know, you know,
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is "You know, "I."
I am afraid of all those things.
I always had fear.
And I also have a lot of other things that people can't be guess.
As the algae and other things like this.
But as I think about it as I think about it and I ask me the last last is why?
Is it rational?
It's logical that anyone who should wait for being sweeped by a job that you feel naired to do it.
But what is there is so particularly in the impremise creative to make us nervous health and other other things in a way that other careful people don't have?
As my father, for example, he was a chemical engineer and I don't remember one time in his 40 years of activity in his 40 years of activity where he was asked if he is afraid to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer in which he was asked if he was asked if he he was asked if he was about a chemical engineer?
It was never -- that block of John, how do you do that?
It didn't work like this, you know?
Onestly, chemical engineers like group don't have certainly in the seat, in the seat, reputation of being alcolized.
We writers, we have enough this reputation and not just writers but creatives of all generes, we have this reputation of being enormously instable, mentally.
And it's not going to look at the tristage of magnificent death of the magnificent death of the creative dead young people and often are young people and often are young people and often are them.
And even those who are not suicide seem to be really disappealed by their womens.
Norman Mailer, before I did, in the last interview, he said, "OI I was killed a little bit more about the job of your life.
But we don't do the boy when we feel like it because we heard these things that so long that somehow we have completely interiorated and accept the notion is somehow we have completely interior the art, to the end of the hell is somehow you and art, to the enjoy and the art, to the enjoy of the hile.
And the question I want to take to all of today,
And it's good for this thing -- because even look at it from a hundred of distance to me not good for this supposal.
I think it's odied.
And I think it's also dangerous and I don't want to see the perpetuate in the next century.
I think it's better to encourage our great minds to live.
And certainly I know that in my case -- in my case -- it would be very dangerous to start to be out to be the knowledge, more than the circumstances in my career.
Oval -- you look at it, I'm pretty young people and I have about 40 years.
I still have about four decades of work in me.
And it's very likely to whatever it will write from now that it will be judged by the world as the work that after the world as the work that I did after my last book.
I'm going to be slavery, because we're all more or less friends here -- it's likely to my greatest successful is my own shoulder.
Oh, Gesus, which is that you think!
You know this is the kind of thinking that door a person starting to be belong-morning, and I don't want to do it.
I would keep doing this work that we do.
So, the question becomes what is it?
And so I think, after many reflective, which the way to work to keep writabout is to create a perspective, right?
I have to somehow to find a safety of security between me, which I'm writing about a confident and my natural anxiety on which reaction that will be able to look for the time to look for the time, trying to find other societies and healthithy to see if they could have the best ideas and healthithy and healthiest healthiest and more healthy healthcare and more healthy than they are doing things and healthiest and healthy and heal
in creativity people to manage the emotional inerent response to the creativity.
And that research led me to the ancient Gree and ancient Roome.
See why I swear because it yet, and then it back.
In the ancient Grece and ancient Rome -- people didn't seem to believe that creativity was from men to man, OK?
It was thought that creativity was this spirit water's divine and who came from a few distant surprising and unknows, and unknows, for reasoning and unknown.
The green spirits were called the demonior of creativity of creativity.
Socry, wonderful believed to have a demon to have a demon wisdom to be loasive.
The Romans were of the same idea, but they were called that kind of spirit without a genius.
The one is great, because Romans didn't think that a genius was really a genius was a kind of smart.
And they believed that a genius was this sort of divine that he believed in the walls of an artist, a little like the Dobby, and who came out to be an elfe of the articking, and that came out to hidden the job of that work.
Ecceptional -- excess is the distance of what I talk -- that construct psychological that you protect from your work.
And everybody knew that it was so that it was so that it worked, right?
So the antic artists were proofed by certain things, like the too narciss; you know?
If your work was exceptional and you couldn't get all the degree and all knew that it was helped by this genius.
If your work fail, it wasn't all of your whole be, right?
Everybody knew that it was your genius to be a incapable to be a incapable.
And so people han conceived the Occidents for a long time.
Then the Researcher came and everything change, and then this great idea, we put the human being to the middle of the universe of the universe of all the other mysteries and without more to leave space to the creatures that write details from divinity.
This was the principle of the rational humans and people started thinking that creativity was completely from the ishsh.
And for the first time in history, it started to referred to this or that artist as a genius to a person with a kind of person with a genius.
And I have to tell you, I think it was a big mistake.
I think that allows somebody, a simple person to believe that being like a recipient as a recipient as the source and the surgeries of all the mysteries of creativity, a very much of a strong strong the fragipsyches that human as we can give to the fragile that human finging.
It's like to ask someone to ingoid somebody to ingoid the sun
Deform and distores completely the ego and create all these ingestious ingestiable for performance.
And I think it's this pressure to have destruct the artists in the past-year-olds in the past-years.
And if this is true, and I think that the question is, and I think that the question becomes it?
Can we do it different?
Maybe I go back to a more ancient understanding of the relationship between human and creative mystery of the relationship of the relationship of the relationship between human and mystery mystery of the relationship between human and mystery mystery of creative human and mystery mystery of the other mystery of the relationship of the relationship between human and mystery mystery and
Or maybe not.
Maybe we can't cut 500 years of thinking about a conversation in a 18 minutes.
And you probably have people in the audience that would have been suspects of scientific suspects on the notion of the notion -- you do they follow people are going to be on their projects.
And it's probably not going to convince you all on this thing.
But the question I want to take is -- why is it -- why not?
Why don't you think that in this way?
Because it has more sense of everything that ever ever heard of creative to exasperants of creative processes of creative process.
One thing that as anybody who ever tried to do something -- so, basically, all here -- you don't have rational behaviors.
And, in fact, it can sometimes look like completely paranormal.
I did this meeting recently with the Ruth Stone that has now 90 years old, but it was a little bit of a poet-year-old time time in his childhood in the Virginia, and he was working out in the wood, and he felt it was in the wood, when a poetry.
He said that it was like a fragorous fragorous fragorous of the air.
And he was rolling to break up to her from the landscape.
And he was going to get it, because he was doing the earth below his feet.
He knew that we have one thing to do to do that point and he was like, "current"
And so she was going to go home and she was following from this poetry, and it wouldn't have to take a piece of paper and a wildlife and a pretty quickly as the trading, as the trading, and it was to take it on the page.
Sometimes he couldn't be quite quickly, so it was so fast and correct and she was correct and then she was rolled through and she was lost and she was going to stay through and and she would continue to break through the landscape, and I was going to go through the landscape, as he said, "other than anything."
Then there were those times -- this piece I don't forget -- there were the moments where the was almost losssweeping, OK?
So, she was running at home and she was looking for the card and she was looking for a dear in the way that she was passing, and then he was like he was going on, and then he said, that was like to walk with the other hand, and the off.
He was offered the poetry from the tail and reput it into his body, and it turned it on the page.
And in these cases, the poetry would be presented on the perfect page and intact, but the opposite, the last word to the first word to the first one of the last word to the first one of the last word at the time.
So when I heard of pens -- it's exactly the huge, it's exactly the huge, my creative process.
I don't all my creative process, -- I'm not a conduct!
I'm a mulation, and my way to work is that; I wake up to the same orary every day and try and work and get us over the enjoy of the time and work on the enjoy of the same time and get it over the enjoying.
But even I stand in my head, I skied against that thing, at the time, and I skidney.
And I guess many of you have to do it.
You know, even though the work and ideas came from a certain source source of a certain source I couldn't honestly know it.
And what is this thing is that?
And how can we relate to us to do that we don't have your head and stuck -- but we do remaintasters?
And as I think of it, the best contemporary example I have is the Musician musician in the Waits, which I interviewed a few years ago for a newspaper.
We were talking about this, and you know, Tom, for the most of life was the incarnation of the artist in the painting of the artist in contemporary action, dominating these totally interiored species, of the totally interiored interiory.
But then he sat it, and she was driving on a day and she was driving on a highway to Los Angeles, changed everything for him.
She was going fast, and everything was going to speeds this little melodia, which comes into his head as it does the inspiring as it does inspiration, elusive, and the wish -- you you know, it's wonderful and wish -- you know, it's wonderful and the desire, but not as to take it.
It doesn't have a piece of card, not a math of card, it doesn't have a record.
So it starts to hear this kind of old anxiety grow in him "I'm going to lose and remarrush from this lost song of this lost song of this lost son.
I don't am pretty good enough, and I can't do it."
And instead of going to stopped in the panic stop.
And I was going to do the whole process and did something completely new.
And he just looked at the sky and said, "cus," you can't see that I'm driving?"
"Do you look like that can write a song nove?
If you really want to exists, you get a more opporter when I can take care of you.
Otherefore, you go to to get somewhere else today.
You go to disturbing Leonard Cohen."
And his process process changed after that.
Not the work, the work even dark as well as we have a seed-like to be seeds.
But the process, and the heavy rnight that was released when the genius, the genius, the genius that came out of him who causes anything about it issues that we had to be an interior that was doing that he didn't have to be something interior and tormented.
but it's a conversation between this wonderful bizarre collaboration between Tom and this thing that was a conversation between Tom and the outside thing that was not Tom.
So how much the story started to change a little bit how I was working and already saved me a time.
This idea, I saved when I was writing "Mangia, Prega, Amae and fall of the disperation that we all have when we do all when we are working on something and we can't think that and we can't think that and you think that it's going to be a worst ever writing.
Not just bad at the worst book writing.
And I started thinking about throwing this project.
But then I remember Tom that talked about the air, and I try it.
So I put my face my face on the mandary, and I would say my comments to a vacuum empty corner.
And I said to high high voices, "Look, you both know that if this book is not going to be brilliant, it's not going to be very bright now?
Because as you see I'm putting it all that I haven't got to do that.
So if you want to be better you have to introduce and do your side.
OK, but if you don't do it, you know what, I don't know it all.
I'm going to go to write the same because it's my work.
And I want to do for me that was recorded that I have to do my own participate that because -- at the end is that I was like, you know, sitting in the desert of the North Africa people who were dances to the wild of the dances of the dances of the Wat, and it sacred to the walk and hours to the heba.
And they were always magnificent because the dancers were professionals and were fantastic.
But every time, something happened to be done -- and one of these artists became actually transmitting in the artists became actually transmitting it.
And I know you know what I talk about it, because I know you have a suddenly point, a lost of it.
It was like time stops and the dance, and the dance, and he was not doing nothing different from the sun of the only one of the time is -- like 1,000 notes before, but everything is stinking.
And suddenly not just like a human being.
But you accessons from divince and delivered in the fire of divinity.
And when this happened when this was when this was the people knew what he was, they called it with his name.
They sheep hands and started singing, "Allah, Allah, God God, God, God, God, God, God, ."
That's God, you know,
Curious note -- when the More invaser's Norder, they were this used to be used to be in the centuries of "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, hey, you can still hear in the corrids or in flamenic.
In Spana, when a artist has done something impossible and magic -- "Hey, magnifi, you know, magnifi, you know, black-argument -- one last of God.
And it's great, because we need it.
But the problem comes up the morning, for the dancers -- when you wake up and discovering that are 11 in the morning, and it turns out that I'm 11 in the morning, and the God is not morning.
It's just a dead with great dead to the knee, and maybe never can ever be able to get to that height.
And maybe nobody will be a name of God still as yet, and what does it have to do with the rest of his life?
It's hard.
This is one of the most painful reconciliations to do in a creative life.
But maybe it doesn't have to be so angoshing if you can not believe it, but not believe, of that the most extraordinary thing of your are come from you to stessi.
But I just believe that there are data in the prestituted by a foundly fount of your life that you have to go to somewhere else when you ended up to somewhere else when you finished.
And, you know, if we think in this way is all change.
And so I started thinking about it, and it's certainly like I thought for several months in the work of the book that audience in the work of the book that I'm going to be a very dealt of my greatest success.
And what I have to keep telling me when I feel electried by this is, not having fear.
Let me just just your job. It just just your job.
It is to depress for your parts, whatever it can be.
If your work is dance, bally.
If the divine, I assigned genius assigned a few kind of wonderful -- just just a few kind of wonderful for a moment through your effort, and then "Oh, y!"
Otherefore, you do the same thing.
And "Oh, you know, you know, you can yourself.
I think I think I should teach it.
"Yes!" at you yourself, even for having human and tests and testing talks to take you to depress to be a continuously.
Thank you.
Thank you.
JJune Cohen: O!
As you know I've been talking about some of these projects on the genome of the genome of the genomes of genes.
Now we're starting a new percoratic -- we started to digitize biology and now starting from that digital code we are coming into a new phase of biology, designing and synthesizing life.
We always tried to ask the big questions.
"What is the life?" is something that many biologists I think they have trying to understand levels.
We tried a different approach, reducing the minimes of terms.
We're typing by almost 20 years ormas.
When we sequenced the human genome was treated to pass from the world of the digital world of the digital world of the computer.
Now let's take us to do this life or create new life from this digital universe from this digital universe from this digital universe to this digital universe as we can regenerate life from this digital?
This is the map of a small organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, which is the species from the smallest genome between those that can self-replicate in the lab of the best genome in the lab of the best genome in the lab of a little organism;
And we tried to reduce the genome to create a even smaller to create a even smaller than that.
We can get a hundred to heliminate a genes of the genes of the 500 that are here.
But when we take a look at the metabolic map of the web map to the noway,
And it's simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate -- it's very improbable, that this can bring a vast cell to live cell.
So we decided that the only way to make the only way to make a progression of this chromosome, so we could modife the components to bring some of these questions.
And so we started the adventure of the "Can we can synthesize a chromoso?"
Can implements to make these great molecules that we haven't ever been able to create before you?
And in case we can make a chromosound?
A chromosome, it's just a chemical piece of chemical material in the unher.
The speed with which we are able to digitalize life is growing to exponential report.
Our ability to write the genetic code -- it's going to progressiping slowly, but it's better.
And our most recently resulted the exponential curve.
We started more than 15 years ago.
The process has required a lot of the past, starting with a bioetic revision before we started the early experiments.
But we found that I'm going to synthesize is very difficult.
There are tens of thousands of cars in the world that producing little segmental segmental of 30 to 50 letters and it's a degenerative proces: the most segment is longer, more mistaker; the more mistakerer's segment is longer, more mistakes.
So we had to develop a new method, to assemble these fragments and reach the mistakes.
And this was our first attempt to go from the digital information of the Phi X 174.
It's a little virus that kills bacteria kills.
We designed the fragments, effective, effectively the reeffort and get a molecule of DNA of about 5,000 letters.
The interesting part is when we took this chemical piece of chemical material and unher, and we put it in bacteria started reading this genetic code and dealing the particles and produce particles --
The particles have been released by the cell phones, they went back and they fit back and they destruct.
I talked about recent with members of the petrolifes said that they have certainly compresent that they certainly understand this model.
They really, I resonate more of you.
We believe that this is a situation where the software can really build his hardware in a biological system.
But we wanted to do the biggest things in the largest things.
We wanted to build the entire bacteria of the bacteria --
I'm more than 580 thousand miles of genetic code --
So we thought we build it in the cassette of viruses so that we can change the seven to understand what the components of a living cell in a living cell cassets of a living cell --
The design is crucial and if we start with digital information in a computer, these must be very accurate it.
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995, the standard accuracy was a mistake for every 10 thousand and and the standard accurately.
We have discovered, resequencing, 30 errors. If we had the original sequence we never had to be able to do it.
One part of the process is designing down to the 50 letters that are overwhelming with all the other segments of 50 letters to build underunit that you can do this together.
Let's try to try to join one here.
You probably have a bed side we put the filight.
Think of this is we have a genetic code based on four letters: A, C, G, and G.
Three of those letters together about 20 administrate acacid -- and there's a specific order to beat every love of beef for every love of every love to minoid.
So we can use the genetic code to write words, you thought, fraise to write words,
What we did we do to do is the self-to do with it.
Some were dolphuses from the fact that it wasn't poetry.
We designed these segments to just put them on a fundamental byes.
There are enzymes that repair and put them assumption.
And we started assembling of parts, starting with five to seven miles in a thousand literally, ones, units to be able to be able to be able to get 124 thousand letter to get to 72 miles.
Anyway, we have produced these sitting in abundance so that we can sequence that we're trying to create a very robust -- as you see in a very robust -- as you see in a minute.
We're trying to carry the process.
So, this looks like the tabellon a flower of a glass of a glass of a glass of a glass of a glass of a glass.
When we get these very long segments to these very long chapes, more than 100 miles, they will not grow more directly in E.
You get to the limits of the modern molecular biology --
So we looked at other mechanics.
We knew another mechanism called omology, which is a homology recombination that in biology is useful to repair the DNA to unique the DNA to unique the segments.
Here's an example.
This organism, called Deinococcus radioaster -- can absorb up three million rads of radiation.
You can see in the upper square like his chromosome, you can come up with it.
In 12 -- 24 hours is reassembled exactly as it was before.
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do it.
These organisms, these organisms,
They can live under empty.
I'm absolutely sure life existing in space, and you get to find new rich environments of water.
In fact, NASA showed that this available to this avail.
This is a picture of the molecule that we built using these processes -- just using the lights with the design of the segments of inserious segments of inseries.
The lightforce them assembate them already.
This image was not taken with a electronic microscope with a regular microscope --
It's a molecule so great that we can see it with a slightly slightly slightly layer.
These are pictures that they cover a period of six seconds.
This is the advertises that we did a long time ago.
I'm more than 580,000 letters of genetic code --
It's the largest of a definitely definitely finding from man.
It has a 300 million hanging weight at 300 million ones.
If we were spending it with a caratter 10 without spaces, you would like 142 pages just to get this genetic code to get this genetic code to be this genetic code to this genetic code to this genetic code to this genetic code to the this genetic code with a 10 paper per packagaging for this genetic code to
Now, how do we work work? How do we active?
Of course, you get a virus is a game by kids.
It's a little more complicated when you use bacteria when you use bacteria --
It's simpler even when it's eucariot cells like ours, you can just extract the nucleus and put another one way, which is basically the process of clonelely, the process of clonelong, which is basically the process of cloning.
In the archaea chromosome, it's integrated in the cell but we have recently demonstrate that we can do a complete trapiant of a cell of a cell to another and active.
We can refit a partnership from a microbial special species.
The two are different as men from the topies.
We added a few genes in the more in a way that we can decide what to do for this chromosoon.
The one has then belonged with enzymes in a way to kill all proteins.
And when we put it in the cell was stupendoing, and you open our graphy degree our graphy -- the new chromosome, he went into the cell phone.
And we really started thinking that we couldn't go that three, but we tried to get more in there.
This is one of the most mechanisms of evolution.
We found that a lot of species have added a second or a third of a third of some parts, add in a second thousands of new tracks to that species.
So who think about evolution like a only gene to evolution that you don't really understand the biologist.
There are enzymes called restripppes of restrictional is that even digesting the DNA.
The cromosome, which was in the cell doesn't have one.
The cell phon-the cell that we have inserito--tail.
And it turns out, and recognized the other chromosome, as a heast, and we have been reported with just the cell and the new cell and the new crummmmit.
It became blue blue because of the genes we have inserved.
And in a short time all the characteristics of a species are gone in a kind of go for, and it turned out to a new software that we put in a new software that we put in the cell phone.
All the protein has changed, membranes have changed, and when we read the genetic code in the equivalent of what we have transferred you.
Now, this could look like genetic alchemia als, but by altering the software are things in a pretty substantial things.
Now, I explained that that doesn't talk about genesis -- but progress from three million and a half million and a half million years of evolution, and I already said that maybe we're going to create a new version of Cambrian explosion of this digital explosion process.
Why do I that?
I think it's pretty obvious when we think of our needs.
We're going to go from six billion to nine people in the next 40 years.
Just to give you an example: I was born in 1946.
Now there's three people on the planet for every every one existing in 1946; 40 years, there are going to be four years, there are going to be four of them are going to be four to be there.
We're going to find out the food food food and clean and clean, medicinals and drink and drinkle for six billion and a half a half billion people.
It's going to be even harder to do it for nine billion.
We use more than 10 billion carbon dioxide more of 30 billion barrels of oil --
That means a thousand barrels to a day.
When we try to find biological processes or whatever the kind of process to replace them is going to be a huge challenge of me.
In more we have to keep account of CO2 from these materials that end up in the atmosphere.
At the day, because of the scientific discoveries that all over the world, we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I like to think that are designed for the future.
The electronic industry is only a dozen of component, and think about how many different things are come out of it.
Our limitations are principles of the biological and our imagination.
Now we have now have some techniques of the rapid methods of symptetization, can create what we call a combinative genomic genomic genomic genomic genomic genomic genomic genomic genomic technique.
We can build a big robot, robots that can produce a million to come a million to the day.
Think of processing these 20 million genes or to try to optimize the process of producing either or pharmaceutes, we can change -- we can change -- because of a little team, and to create more molecular biology now that in the last 20 years of science.
And it's just a standard section section.
We can choose for chance to survival, chemical or or fueling fuels.
This is an instantanececececk of some software programmed to be able to sit and design species to the computer.
Well, we don't know that we need to be a lot of how they will be year.
We know exactly what their genetic code --
Now we're focusing on the carbon carbon carbon on carbons.
You also see you that you get ethanol from the grate was an outside.
We have fuels depending on the third generation that will come up with enough sugar, the higher of the highest value as the either as the either of the sloping or different kinds of throwing kinds of throwing out of the highest things that are going to be pretty soon as the either of the highest generation of the higher generation of the higher as the either of the higher as the top of the higher as the top of the higher and the heavight of the weapons and the most
But the only way biology can have a great impact without increasing increasing the cost of food and limiting the cost of food and restrong the CO2 in materials, to which we are working for designing cells that we can reach this purpose -- and we think we could have the first carbon dion on fourth generation in about 18 months.
The sunlight, just in the CO2 is a methodom -- but in our discoveries around the world, we found several methods.
This is an organism that we described in 1996.
It lives in the deep ocean to about 2,500 feet to the eboiling temperature of water.
It creates metane from CO2 using hydrogen molecular hydrogen as source of energy.
We're trying to understand if we can put the CO2 to CO2 in CO2 to CO2 in the CO2 in order to drive this process.
So short we think that we might be able to increase what the basic question that the basic question is, what the life," is really, really, -- we have the modest of replace the whole petrochemical industry.
Eistrict. If you can't do it from TED, where can you do that?
It would be a main deep source of energy.
And so, we're working on the same methods to the same methods to create the instantaneous instaneous --
You saw this year with the flu and we are always behind a year and with a dollar when it's trying to find the right vaccine.
I think what you can change in a combinable vaccines in anticipate.
So here's how the future could start to look at changing, now, the tree of evolution, accelerating evolution with bacteria -- archaaeucarian aotic cells.
We're at so much from the way to improve people.
Our purpose is to do that in a way of live enough to try to do it. Thank you very much.
First of all I'm going to show you -- the fastest possible for some fundamental job of the new technology that we took the Microsoft to a nearly year a year ago -- that's Seadragon.
This is a local environment, where you can interact with a huge amount of visual data.
Here we're seeing a lot of gigabyte of digital pictures with a kind of zoom and continuous photos of a continuous zes as we want to be like we want.
And not matter how big the amount of information that we see, how big these data is the amount of data or images.
Most of them are digital photographs, but this is a scanning scanning from the Biooxels of Congress and rewides in the leg, but this is a 300 megapixel.
It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that limits the predictions of a system like this is the number of pixels on your screen in whatever moment. It's also a very flexible architecture. It's also a very flexible architecture.
This is a whole book of not imagines.
This is Dickens. Every desolated of Dickens. Every column Casa capitulate of a capitule.
To share you to show you that it's just about testing and not imagines, we can do something like this, to see that it's a real representation of the head, not a picture.
It could be a little artificial way to read an electronic book.
I don't advice.
This is a more realistic example of the Guardian number of "The Guardian --
Every image is the beginning of a section.
And it really gives you the pleasure and the beautiful experience of law the cardacean of a magazine or a fifth of a fifth of a fifth of a kind of meeting.
We also did something with the corner of this number in the U.K.
We created a fasulla add resolution -- much more higher than what you use in a normal commercial advertising -- and we put you in a normal content of extraordinary content of the extraordinary content -- and we put it of it.
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile objects, you can see here.
Or other models, or even specific specific specific specific --
And this really demonstrate shows some of these ideas to get the limitations of space on the screen.
But we hope that this gentleman to put the pop-up and other porcheries -- not to be necessary.
Of course, the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology.
And I don't want to lose time, if I don't mean that we have contributed to also do this field.
These are all the streets in the U.S. overlaptops above a of NASA Human patial image of the NASA Hupon I.
So now we're going to go to something else.
This is now it's actually from the vision on the webs; you can go to see.
This is a project called Photosynth, which fights two different technologies.
One is Seadragon and the other is a very interesting visual computer to do very interesting by Noah Snavely, a student of the University of Washington, with the help of Steve Seitz of the UWashington, with the help of Microsoft Research. A great collaboration.
And it's from the alive on the web, and I was managed by Seadragon.
You can see it when we do this kind of screening, where we can go from an image to the other and have this kind of experience to the other people's resolution is multiple resolution is multiple resolution is multiple of the imagination.
But the spacecraft collection of images here has actually a meaning.
The southern visualization of computer has registered these pictures together, so that they correspond to the real places that the reals to the real places that the Grassian on Montagne Roccic Found. So here you see the elements of a slide-stable elements of a slide-stable department or imagining panoramic and these things are all connected to space.
I don't know if I have time to show you some other environment.
There are a lot more spacecraft of it.
I want to go directly to one of the original data, and this is from a previous prototype of Photosynthosynthosynthosynthese, that we have been doing this technology for the first time last summer -- to show you what I think is really the key behind this technology, Photosynthosynthizing the environment we put in the website --
We had to worry about the legal aspects and forth and forth.
This is a reconstruction of Notre Dame images from Flickr. Bastdigital Flickr. Bastern Dame in Flickr and you get images of types in the shirt and you get images of the camps, and I say that this is a picture that we have a picture that you have a picture that you have a picture that we have a picture of the model of the model of the maintains.
So they're all images by Flickr and were all related to this way.
And it's possible to navigate in this simple way.
You know, I would never end up to work for Microsoft.
It's very gratificing to get this kind of account here.
I think you can see that it's a lot of different types of fotou types from those of the SLR, a meaningful number of things --
And if I can try to look for those more strange.
Many are blocked by face, etc.
Something is a series of photographs -- there it is.
This is a poster of Notre Dame record.
We can go from physics to physics to physics to the physics of this environment.
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment. This is now now now being given data from everyday collective interaction of how to appear -- and all those data together.
All those photos become college together, more hours than the parts.
You have a model of the entire emerge.
Think about this as a promotion of Stephen Lawler on the earth, virtual Earth
It's something that grows in complexity as people are using it, and the advantage to the useful increase with use.
Their photos are marked with metadaphors from other people.
If you get the idea of contrast all these sants say the name, my picture of the Noter Decem of Noter Dutch of all those dates, and I can use it as a point of the data, and I can use it to deserve to deserve in that space, in that metaphor to get a photokid to other, and have a very red-moves red-to-shelter, and have a red-red red-to-re-shin-to-re-shelmm-shelter and cross-scale of all of all of these kinds of demmmmmels of the huser.
Of course, a consequence of everything is very high-processed virtual models of every interesting part of the earth, and so that it doesn't only seat, and from images and satellite pictures and satellite picture.
Thank you very much.
CA: I understand good? What is you know about your software will be doing is that at a certain point, in the next few years, all the photographs of the next few years, all the photographs of everyone in the world or be accounting?
BAA: Yeah. What is doing is doing in practice.
It's creating hyperlink, if you want to be a imagine.
And it's doing it in the content of the images.
And it becomes very interesting if you think about the wealth of the semantic information that many of these images are in the imagination.
As you look at images on the web, and the phrase on the web, and the text on the page of the images of the pictures of the photos.
Now, what if that picture you connect to all your picture?
So the amount of semant interconnection and the amount of wealth that is really really enormous about is really enormous about is a remarkable effect.
CA: Blaise, it's really amazing Compliments.
BAA: I thank you very much.
One of the main pleasure when you travels and one of the delipth of the innographic research is the way to live in the middle of the old traditions, in the wind, the touch in the wind, the guns in the wind pietrangs from the plants.
You think that the South the monkey is still the Way, the Way, or the Way, or the Inuit is still coloring of meaning, or that in Himalaya, the budness, the inner of the Dhar, and the idea that the world in which we live in absolutely the world in which we live in absolutely but it's just a model of reality, and the idea that the world in absolutely a model of reality, but it's just a model of reality,
the consequence of a particular set of adaptative adaptative that our stirps has done, good or male many generations ago.
And, of course, we all share of essential tracts.
We all hidden it.
We're subject to get the way to get the way to get the way of the way we are subject to get the way of the initiation.
We have to deal with deaths of death, so we don't surprise and balance --
We all have an art.
What it is the depth of the canzone, the rhythm of every culture.
Not matter that are the Penan forests of Borneo, or the follows of Haiti, or the Woodoo desert Kenya or desert in Kenya, or Curander's Curander's Curander's Curander's Gera.
He was my journey company in the desert a month ago, or a month ago, or a walls of the Qomolang, on Everest, the degree of the world.
All of these people teach us that there are other ways of thinking about existing ways of thinking about it, other ways of moving in the world.
And if you reflect a minute, it's a concept that it can give you hope
Inside, the cultures of the world creating a spiritual and the world creating a spiritual and cultural life that it is important for the benefit of the planet and is important for the benefit of the planet as a biosphishshelter.
And you can think about this ran toxic race as a ethnoxfer and you can define the ethnoxiety of all the concepts, mitted by the images of the imagination, being inspired meeting to be from the imagination of the consciousness of consciousness.
The ethnosphere is the wonderful pathrimony.
It's the symbol of what we are and what we can be in quisitives.
And because biosphere has been seen, as it has been quite as much as it has been so much faster and unfortunately, too faster than it was very quickly.
No biologist, for example, it would say that 50 percent of all the species is in the eastern of the exestination just because it's fail, or -- in the most apocalittic -- in the field of biological diversity, and not available to the most optimistic -- that of the cultural diversity -- that of the cultural diversity --
The indicate of all of that is, of course, loss of language.
When you're born 6,000 languages on this planet.
A language is not just composed to just from a vocabulary of grameric rules.
One language is the sprap of the human spirit.
It's the middle of all culture.
Every language is a forest of mind, a swise, a thinking ecosystem.
And of those 6,000 languages, as we sitting in Monterey, at least half it is not more ssurrying in the ears of the children.
They don't get more teacher children, which means less you get to babit something, which is already dead.
What is that more tristands of being the silence, the last talk to a language, of being the last talk to a language, of not having a way to get the sad of emasize of the promise of the promise of the promise of the mind?
This orring is the state of someone in the world every two weeks a couple of weeks a two weeks a laughter and door and door and door with a language.
And I know anyone who will say, "That's not the best way?
The world would not be a better place if we all talk about all the same language as we all have yorubian yoruba. We talk about a lot of yoruba.
Let's talk about kogis.
You will find a cute of a tract, what it means you can't talk about your language.
I would like to do a journey through the ethnosferap through the ethnosferap --
a little journey in the etnospher's about: I get a about:
Many of us forget that when I say, "different ways of existing ways of existing in the ways of existing world.
Take for example this Barasana, in Amazony, the people of anacony, the people of anacony, the people of anacony, who believes in the latest sacric sacries.
This is a population that is not able to distinguish the blue color from the green green because the time celests is identified in the forest time of the forest, which depends the population.
They have a strange language and a marriage rule and a marriage rule, "exogamics of a person who talks a different language.
And all of that has roots in the pastlife-slow-to-extreme is that in these extremely families in which you are about six or seven languages to nobody is a language.
They just listen to and then start talking about.
We take one of the most interesting tribes with the most interesting tribes with the Waorani Ecuador nororal population that has had the first contacts in 1958.
In 1957 to five missionaries have trying to do a facing factual mistake.
They took the top of the photographs that they would report them in pose that they could deliver loss that this people of pluvial forest, never seen anything bi-dimensional rainforce had never seen bi-dimensional bie-dimensional bie-dimensional dimensional raise.
They collect photos from the ground, they turn to the search of a form or a figuring -- they don't find anything, they have conclaim that was going to be brought five missionaries with the les.
But the Waorans don't just killed the stranimal just to force forign
They killed between them.
54 percent of the death was caused by their own themselves.
We are eight generations in eight generations and we found two of natural deaths and when we put it to know that one of them was agreed to be so that they died agree again as they died again -- and then killed himself.
The hunters were able to recognize the animal from 40 steps and recognize the species.
In the early '80s, I was assigned a very interesting job when my Harvard professor of Harvard was asked if I wanted to go to Haiti to intrufer to intrufer to Haiti to incoes, and Tonton Macoes, and Tonton Macoes, and I sessentially ended up to use the veleness to make the shombies.
To make sense of miracle I should have to understand the Voodoo culture and that Voodoo is black isn't black hole.
It's pretty much a metaphor or of the world.
Very interesting interesting --
If I ask you to tell the great religions of the world religions of the world, what would I say about that?
Cristians, Islam, Buddismo, Ebruary.
A continent is always left out of there, thinking that sub-Saharan Africa has no religious faid and Voodoo is not religious faid of these very profound religious conceptions of these very profound religious conceptions of naired.
What makes you interesting your voodor is the intriguing between life and death.
So you live your spirits.
The spirits can be invocated by Grande Acut, which they respond to the dance of dance and they replace to the delivered the animal in a long way that for a short active active to the deal.
So this is why you go to a white voodom to go to talk about God.
We give you a deep in the theme and we become God."
And from the moment you are posssedump that drive, how can you get you word?
So you look at these incredible events. I follow your voice in the state of trances that touch impuns to touch the body that touch of the mind of the mind of the mind of the mind when it's catalyzed in a state of extreme to a state of extreme ex.
And in all the people with the most extraordinary the most extraordinary Kogi of Santa Marcket's Santa Marckey in Santa Santa Santa Santa Santa Santa Santa Santa Santa Santa Santa Santa is that I lived the most extraordinary of the most extraordinary of the Nevada Santa is the Kogi in the most extraordinary of the Santa Santa Mogi of Santa Desases of Mescape.
It turns out that the ancient civilization that once they live on the caraibes of Colombia in the attacking of the Colombia in the conquista, the population of the previous that that you would get on the carbe.
In a macchieved continent, this population never been conquisted by the spagnowles.
But at all, they're governed by a classroom but their training is a very extraordinary.
The young following are taken by the family to three or four years, and they live in a secret world in a world world of good and shake to the base of the ice for 18 years.
Two period of nine years of propositions to reproduce the nine months of management that spend in the user of the mother, are now metaphically in the user of the use.
For this time, they get accultured to the values of their society, values that they previous and only their prayers and only their prayer to be constantly -- or to say the ecological equilibrium -- or to say the ecological equilibrium -- or to say the ecological equilibribrium -- or for the ecological equilibrium -- or for the cosmic equilibrium -- or for the worth of their society, values that
At the end of this amazing beginning, they get suddenly brought up and the first time in the first time in 18 years, they see a alba. And in that active of the first bat, when the sun sun is the sun -- when the sun is a game conference is all his own own theory is conference. The pre-income is a speaking and saying, and it says,
"Right? Propride how I have to tell you about it.
It's stupid. Now it's looking for it."
They call the greatest brothers and say that we we, the minors, we are the hitself of the world.
This level of intuition is extremely important.
When we think of Indian populations and we invote Rousseau and the old story of the wildlife of the nowwildlife in his simplicity or maybe we can invoice and say that these people are close to the Earth of us.
The people are not feeling that not feeling about the indebolds from our dayside.
There's no space for these things in malaric staming in the gelides of the Tibet, but because of time and reports, but because of time and reports, they created a mystic of the Earth is not about the concept of being aware of the most subtle becomes more underneath than the deliver, but for the knowledge.
What does it mean to say?
That means that a guy of Ande who grows Ande who grows is a dry of Apu that is a foundly foundly foundly different and will will be a deep deep and will have a very different relationship with the mountain or that place to a mounteer of the World Women is a very different than a Montana growing massive of rock rock of rock rock rock rock is willing to be a courageful.
which is the death of a spirit or a cut of mineral is irrelevant.
What is interesting is the metaphor that define is that the relationship between the individual world.
I grew up in the forests of the Britannica creating that the forests were going to be cut.
And that has resilized a different human beinger from my friends who believe that the forests are the death is Hukukukukukukukukukukuk's beet-beats that live in the world we are living to deal in the world we are facing in the Hukey to be different than the Hukwatsa.
If you start to look at that these cultures can actually create different reality, you can start to understand some sense-sensational.
I took this picture to open the western Amazon Amazony.
Maybe some of you have heard of the ayahuas's illitor the most powerful supports of the repertoiday's repertoo.
What makes fascinating as ayahuas's potential is not the potential for the support, but his elaboration. It's composed to two elements.
From a lian wood, this lia bunch of beta-carboline, harmine and harmine molinogene.
And by making the only planta shelter that you will get a filled sheet that you can get a consciously, but it's measured with the leaves of coffee of the coffee of the coffee.
This planta plant, powerful powerful powerful to the serotonin, demethyltryptamine-5, methoxyltryptamine-5, methoxyptamines.
If you ever see the Yanomami tyrare on the nose of the support that they do from a different set of species, anchecks methoxydimethoxyltryptamine.
Tiring that policing on the birth is a little bit like being disappeared by a file of barocks and land on a sea sea of electricity. Risategy. It creates a debate of reality.
I was often going to often with my professor, Richard Evan Shultes, the man who took the psychopic was a psychopic funger of the hallucinogens in the '30s in Mexico.
Second I don't have to be classified these triptamines like hallucinogens because if you're done not telling anybody to be hallucind. And it's lost not being a device, because they're denied by an enzymmes that are obvious to be in the intention, of the intestine, you know, of the initial convenient of the intentions.
It's possible to be assume just if you put it with other chemicals that dening the MAO.
Now it's the beautiful beta-carboline that are in-carboline that are inbats of MAO, the same kind of necessary to be able to be able to be able to do triptamines. The question is spontane: in a flying of 80,000 species of plants, how do these people find two dead dead -- how these people find in this way, believe a biochemical version of part?
We use the great euphemism of proof of the proof the proof of the proof the proof of the proof the proof the proof of the proof the proof the proof the proof the proof the proof the proof the proof the proof the proof the proof the proof the proof the proof the proof the proof the proof the proof the proof the proof the proof the proof the proof the proof the proof of the proof of the proof of the proof of of of the proof of of of of of of the proof the proof the proof the proof the proof the proof the proof the proof the proof the proof the
But if we ask Indians, they will tell us "Polin."
What does it mean to say?
This tribe, Cofan, has 17 variety of ayahuas's hot, which distinguishing nicely in the forest, and that our eyes would come into the same species.
If we ask how they were to ask how they stabilize their pocksons will tell us about plants, of the rest I don't know any?" I said, "No."
The solution is, you take 17 variety in a night of the rain and each one will be with a different tone.
With this not a Harvard, but it's much more interesting than contare the same way to count the stames.
Now, the problem is that also is that the ones that have to be the people who have heart people who have to be painting them in the marges of the history of our real world and deal with the sea real world of the real world and fold.
In fact, the 20th century, 300 years, it's not going to remind for his wars or its innovations or technological innovations that but rather like the age of technological innovations and we have been destructively or accepted destruction of the planet. Now the problem of the planet. Now the problem is not change.
All cultures through the centuries have been involved in a dance for new possibility of life.
And the problem is not technology.
Indians don't have to stopped being Sioux when they put from the arre and cocking, and as Americans don't stop being Americans when they put from the horse and calessly.
It's not the change or technology or technology that threatening the integrity of the netnosfer. It's the power.
The last fly of the domination.
And if you look at the world look at the world, you find that these are not destined culture.
I live living creatures and dynamics out of the existence from existence to existence that are beyond their ability to adaptation.
I think it's a disbodishing in the patries of the Penan:
a population of Sarawak, in the high asiatic Sarawak, a population that has lived in the forest to a generation -- and now reduced to the saves of the rivers of the rivers of the rivers of the rivers of the Meridional, which looks like Borneo of the Meridional, where the Japanese Meridional, where the Japanese Meria, where the Japanese Meria,
ready to report the stock with the wooden wood.
Or in Yanomami, are the disease that have come with the disease that have come with the discoveries of the golden of the golden of the golden of the gold.
If we move on to the Tibet, where I'm doing many research, where I'm doing many research, you'll see the harmor of political domination.
As you can know the genocide -- the physics of a popular population, but celebrated it in the universal level, but the destruction of a popular population, not just convicted in the environmental of a popular population, not just convicted in certain environments, because it makes part of the development.
And you can't understand the suffering of Tibet until you get part of the beginning.
I lose the 6,000 miles from Chengdu in Chengdu through the Tibet sudorial sudden, coming to Lhasa young line, but only arrived to Lhasa young line, but only arrived the statistics we talk about.
6,000 monuments sacred in the polite and energy.
1.2 million people killed by military in the Cultural volution
The father of this guy was ascritical to Panchen Lama.
The one means that it's been killed at the time of the Chinese invasion of the Chinese invasion of the Chinese invasion of the Chinese invasion of Chinese invasion of the Chinese invasion.
Her is fighting with Sua Santity in the diaspora that has taken the population in Nepal.
Sua mother was imprisoned and his mother was to be real.
It was brought to bird to the age of two years born birth th th because it could not live without him.
The sister, which has done the same, it was in the field of reedue.
One day he did inherent a black Mao and a fasraffiger Mao and -- that transgressive, was put on the forced for seven years.
The Tibet can be unable, but the spirit of the population is from tenner.
At the end, all of the whole thing is a choice.
We want to live in the world of the world of the world or we want to get the policicicyromatic world of diversity?
The great ancropology Margaret Mead, before we die said that his greatest fear of the world was that in our view of the world, not just we're going to see the legal legal of the imagination of human imagination -- we can see a constantly unveiled by a demental of mindsleeping until they were other possibility.
And it's humiliating to reminate that our species is existed for 600,000 years.
The Neoliter's revolution that gave us agriculture, which has done us to deal with the semble, replacing the poetry of the classroom with the classroom to the classassroom and we talk about 10,000 years ago.
The modern world industrialized in the world has to be 300 years.
That squallia story not suggests that we have the answers to all the challenges that we have to deal with the millennian to come.
When you get these cultures of the world is asked what it means to be human, they respond to 10,000 different voices.
And it's in these answers that we all are going to all the possibility of being what we are, a kind of conscious species that has to do all the populations and all the gardens can be the fixiety moment.
I took this whole whole north of the north of Baffin, when I went to the whale of Baffin, when I went to Inuit, and this man, Olayer, I said, the wonderful story of his grandfathers.
The canadec government was not always gentlement with the Inuit and in the '50s to stabilize our premaintainer, we have requitted them in colonies.
The grandfather of this man refuse to go to the way to go there.
The family for his life, and I took all the arms, and all of his carms, and all its attaction.
You have to know that Inuit doesn't temes the cold --
The slittles of the origin were made of heavy packs in the horibs.
The grandfather of this man didn't do it by the arty or the baths of the artic or bylizes that suffering from the articket.
It's suncharioled by the bunch of pantalons in your hands. When the flight-footbed in your hand. When I did the careful work creating a lam.
It spruzed on the door of this key salive and when she became solid, killed a dog.
He brought the dog and created a brieffort with the kinger cassa gun, and he created another dog and he has gone on the other dogant songs.
We want to talk about cabine? [Risat] And this, in different ways, and this in different ways, and this is the symbol of the Inuit and all the people in the world.
In the 1999 government canadec government has released to Inuit to the total control, of an area of the largest territorial of California and Texas I put together together.
It's their new pathria. It's called Nunavut.
It's an Indian territory territorium. They share all the minerary resources.
I mean, I have an example of how a national national state can reconcise with his people.
And I finally, I think it's pretty obvious to who are at least who was in these remote areas of the planet, realize that they don't have any removed.
For someone is home.
They represents of human imagination that are sat at the time of the time. And for us all of these children, like our children, as our children, as our children, are part of our children, become part of the hope.
To end, we National Geographic we are convinced that politicians will never come to nothing.
We believe that polemicemics,
[[Apausies] not persuasive, but we believe that stories can change the world, and maybe we're the best institutioning to tell stories of the world. Every month, and we have 35 million visites.
156 countries transmitting our television canal.
Our magazine is a million people.
Our work is to travel in the ethnospher's wide, to bring our public public and cultural from which they go out of the way to be because they have a lost of the ancient revealing of the ancient of the antiboard of the antiboard of the antipylies of the anti-world world to be a very life in a world of plural and multicultual multicultural and multicultural multicultual and multicultural final world to get to be in different to be to get to get to be in different cultural red.
where the wisdom of all the people can contribute to our collective benefit.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book I hope to call other than other than you have heard and try to deliver some links in case not nothing.
I want to start with what I call the official."
The official dog's official?
The official dogmain of all the Western industrial societial industrial societies: "If we want to get the benefit of our citizen."
The reason is that it is a size, in the fact that freedom is in itself a value, is preventionable, essential for human beings.
On the other is that if we are free, each one of us can account to do everything that massive our benefit -- without nobody who decided to do nobody without any deciding nobody that decide in the name of ourselves.
The way to massizing the freedom is to be massizing choice.
More choices people are more and more are free, and the more or is their freedom, more or is their benefit to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be freedomer choices --
This is a range -- it's so deeply deeply in the society that nobody would have to put it in the doubt of the society.
And it's also deep deep in our lives.
I'm going to show you some examples of what progress has repossible.
This is my supermarket. It's not particularly big.
I lost a simple note on the conditions.
In my supermarket is 175 conditions, without contact the 10 variety of extravian and 12 balloes of extraverage and 12 whales you can buy a huge number of confident of constant constance that nobody of your 175 ready ready is your gradiment of your own own own own is of your gradiment.
Here's what the supermarket.
Then you go to the sheep sheep to buy a stere: Casses, reader, radio, reader, radio, plaster, legacy.
And in this single store, there's a great audience.
We can do six million and a half different combinations using the components that there are in one negoties.
You have to admit that there's a lot of choice.
Other camp: the world of communications.
Once I was a baby, when I was a baby phone wishes that were forming mother from Mom Bell.
He was known to bought the phone I didn't buy it.
A consequence of that, in the way, was that the phone is that the phone is not a make.
These times are gone to be there.
We now have a variety of telephone of the phone cell phone --
Here's the cell phones of the future.
My favorite is that in the middle, reading MP3, cut cutting of the birth of the birth of the birth cry.
If you don't have seen it even seen in the store, you're very well certain that will preme to get there.
And what the end, what happens is that people in the stores of the stores and say, "No."
You can't buy a cell phone that doesn't do too many things.
So, in other aspects of life that are much more important than water, you think the same explosion of choices.
Ladish: not on the healthcare -- it's not going to go from the doctor and the doctor of what you have to do.
Instead, you go to the doctor, and the doctor says, "Okay, "OK, we can do A, or B" "Betephies, and these risk."
You say, "Doctor, what should I do to do with that?"
And the doctor says, "A benefits and these risks, and these risk."
"What do you want to do that?"
And you say, "Dr. if she was me, what do you do to do that?"
And the doctor, "But I'm not le."
The result we call the "malato," expression that makes it look like a beautiful thing.
But it's not a sweeping and the responsibility of making decisions by someone knowing something -- or somebody's doctor, to somewhere else knows -- and so it's not not not in the ideal condition, and so not in the ideal condition to make decision-of-conditional decisions of the patient.
There's a huge marking of drug products of pharmaceutical products of people like me and you, if you think it's not a send sensus sense, because we can't buy it.
But if we can't buy them, why are they public to buy them in public and they are they going to be able to buy them,
The answer is that they want to do that domer to make a doctor to make the receptor to make it reception.
Something that is so fundamental as our identity is a question of choice, as you see in this journey of the eye. We don't want to force the children. They don't want to be a little bit of identity."
And we can reinvention ourselves how many times we get aggrade there.
That means that every morning, in the risking, you have to decide that kind of person want to be to be a person to be being.
And in the family and marriage a time perspective, a time perspective, uncontted almost for anybody anybody who was married the most preme possible, and it was going to get the most prestant.
The only real choice was with while, not when you don't even get to do later.
On day, it's really really going to play it.
I think very smart students very smart, and I do 20 percent of the work at least at a time.
And because they're not like brilliant, not because they're less diligents.
But why I'm implement, I mean, I should have to ask myself, or no? I should I do that?"
"Could I spost me later? I think before the kids or care?"
I'm interrogatives now.
And they try to answer these questions, even though this implements not completing the companies that asseger and not get a good vote to my exame.
And they really need to do that. I am important questions.
Now, the job: we're lucky, like Carl underlun, because technology allows us to work every day, from every day, from every single angle of the planet, except that from Hotel Randphol.
And in the parents, there's a corner, and I don't tell anyone who is what the works.
I don't say to you, because I want to use it.
What means, this amazing freedom of choice that we have about the work? It's we have to keep decided, and all of the time, if we have to work or not.
We can go to see our son playing to calcium in a take, the Blackberry in the wingdom, and the notebook, typically on the knee.
And even though they're all spasked, every minute that we see our son to remaintain the title, we're also asking this call?"
"Do I have to answer this email? I get abbow? I get this literacy?
And even when the answer is "no," all this makes the experience of your headline, very different than what would be in other conditions.
So, whatever we look at some of the big things and stuff -- things and style and stiles of life, life is a question of choices.
Obut, the world was this: Over, there were some possibilities, but it was not a question of choice.
The world today looks like this. The dilemma is that the delemma is that it or negative?
The answer is St.
The positive side we all know -- so I'm going to talk about the negative ones that are the negative side.
All this choice behavior two negative effects on people.
The first paradoxily, paradoxyysis, is that producing instead of free.
With many options between the way that you choose to do it.
I give you a meaningful example of a meaning about voluntary flying.
A colleagues had access to the data of Vanguard, the giant deal with about a million clientescicicial deep with about a million clients.
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are offered in the more, the percentage of flower airness of the other than 24 percent.
With 50 founds in less than 10 percent in less than dealing with when they're available, it's just 5. Why?
Because with 50 founds in the foundly difficult decider, and choice is to decide to be remainerately remainerately difficult to decide to the questions.
And I still ask questions, and tomorrow questions, and of course, the questions don't get it.
You know that not just means that just means that this is going to be eats because they don't have enough money, to say that decision is so that they also lost the decision is so that they also lose the financial foundation of the working.
Not participating -- they're losing until 5,000 dollars from the dator of the working, which would be very well to deal with it.
So the paralysis is a consequence of having too many choices.
And I think that makes the world like this.
"And finally, for enables: ketchup, senape or maine?
You just want to take the right decision if it's for ethnity, right?
You don't want to choose the wrong and you don't want to choose the wrong condition to the wrong condition to the wrong condition of it.
So this is the first effect. The second is that even if we can avoid paralysis and make a choices, at the end of how we were going to be with less options between the result of how we would choose to what you choose to the worth of what you choose to the paralyside.
And this for several reasons.
One of these is that with a lot of conditions between the whom if you buy one and it's not perfect, it's easy to imagine that you could have to have a different choice that would be better than you can have been better than the imagination of the choice, and the remains of choice, and the rempiant sodsatile of the decision of the decision of the decision of the decision --
even when it was a great decision.
More choices are -- the more you are easy to any detail that is inherent of the option of choice.
But there's what economists call it consto-opportunity.
Dan Gilbert closest stamattine as the value that we give to the things depends on what we compare we confronti.
Del rest, when there are many options possible is easy to represent the features of the alternative cards of the oppositionative careful that is choice.
Here's an example. I get me with all the ones that are not New York.
But it's what you probably thought to be like.
There's this copy of Hamptons.
A place of the swrist.
Spipes in the spind. It's all about them.
Not anything. But what he thinks he thinks is, "Well, maledies, but it's Agoor."
"All my neighbors in Manhattan are live."
"I could just talk to the home."
And he sent two weeks that idea is losing -- every day -- the chance of a lose where you want.
The decrease of the decrease of the relieving for what we have, even when choice was excellent.
And more are the options that we have to look at the more than the characteristics are return on as an expensive opportunity.
Here's another example.
This is a lot of things.
It talks about the time and maybe of living slowly.
But the most important point is that whatever you choices, you can get it to not do the others.
The things that we don't choose to do that they have a lot of active activity what we do.
Third point of the growing point:
I tried it on my skin, buying a new jeans.
I was almost always jeans.
Once jeans were just just like, you buy them and go from the bestid, they were swestid, only after I took them a life and work with a lot of times, they were doing a lot of times, they were going to good.
So, I went to buy a couple of jeans, when the ones were gone, and I said, "I'm going to have a couple of jeans, this is my cut."
The committed said, "You want slim fit, folder?"
Who wants to do this cernier or with the bottonies?
"Do you want to get a rotate shelelse?"
"Would you like to get larghs or stret? Ble bla -- he was he was doing the blawarencars.
I was smoking, and after a little bit of I could say, "I want the kind of like -- which was the only guy -- that was the only one guy who was so I got to try to all maleately go out of the negoti," and then I went out of the negoti, with the best two jeans I ever have.
It was the massive one. With all that choice I had gotten a bunch of the world.
But I felt worse
Why? I wrote a book to understand it.
The reason I was worse that I was worse with all that choice were the waitative of my expectations were very perfective.
At the beginning I was waitimating. I didn't expect nothing about exceptional when it was only one of the way, but when it was living 100 different guy.
What I had watched was good, but not perfect it.
After having paragonated that what I was trying to do with what I tried to do with the expectations.
The addition of options in the life of people don't do that increase the expectations that these have respect to the options of options itself.
And this will promise less soddisfation, when the results are good.
No one in the world of marketing if it makes it content.
Because if you know, you don't know what I'm talking about.
The truth looks more like this.
"You were better when you were worse when you were worse when you were better when you were worse is that when you were worse to even meet the premise of pleasure.
Over the world we live -- opulent towns with the initial initial injectory with the perspective -- the maximum that we can hope is that things are at the expectation.
You never surprised to pleasures because your expectations, my expectations, my expectations, and I got ingiant forever.
The secret of happiness -- what you're here -- that's "Basexpectated" "Yes, I want to do it."
I mean -- little little cargotta -- which is really married and my wife is really stupendy.
I couldn't do better, I don't have to do better, I don't have to do better.
But account is not always a bad thing.
And finally, a consequence of buying jeans comods when there's only that jeans is that when you are not satisfacts, and you ask you "Why?
"Who is responsible?" The answer is clear.
The world is responsible. What can I do about that?
When there are hundreds of jeans, and you buy a insoddisfacent, and you ask you who is responsible for the responsible for you are responsible for you are you.
You could have better better better than that.
With hundreds of variety of avavailable -- there's no excuse for the insuccess.
So when people get decisions, even though the result is valive, they feel inherent and they give the sweat and they give the same.
In the last depression is exploded in the industrialized.
I think a meaningful factor -- not the uniquque, but important -- of this wave of depression is that people have deludent deludent because standards are too high.
And when they need to explain this situation they think that the sat is them.
So the final result is that we are in general, objectively, but we feel worse.
Let me give you a remind.
This is the official dogmaybe, what we all take for good and it's completely fail.
There's no doubdoubt that a little choice is better than it is not going to have any time but it doesn't come a lot of choice is better than a little bit.
There's a critical value of critical value what it is.
But I'm sure we have overcome from a piece of the way the choices better.
Now, from the political point -- I have almost finally -- from policiicies, the nock of the policies, the nock is the follow.
What it allows all this choice in industrial societies, is the material.
There are many places in the world, and you know you know about it, where the problem is not that they have too much choice.
The problem is that they have too much.
So the faccenda I'm talking about is a male's an exclusive, being deep exclusive, which is a Western societies.
And what despspring and angry is this: Steve Levitt talked about how the cost of those and sat seats are inuseless for bimbes are inuseless. It's a money.
I mean that these choices, complicated and dispendioss, it's not just inuseless.
I'm deleterious to deleteria.
We do worse in the worst of it.
If a little bit what in our societies societies allows so much choice was reversed in those where people have too much possibility, it would not only be their life to be able to improve but the noway,
This is what economists call a paretyan improve improvement.
A releases of recome towards good to all -- not just to the poor -- because of this choice in except that it tower.
And so finally, you can become everything that you want,
Voick, people of culture, what makes that fishery that fisher?"
"It's obvious that you can't do anything in a vetrow of wetrote wet."
"A cooked," a limited vision of the world --
and I stand so I got it so yet that I started to start with it.
But then, I think of it, I realized that that fishes the long knows that that fishes the long knows
Because the reality of the fact is that if you send to frantumming the bocky of the way that "everything is possible," you get the liberty.
If you break the mouse in a way that everything you can decrease the satisfacfacation.
Waccepting paralysis, and you get the benefit to be able to get the benefit to be able to get the wealthy of paralysix, and you get the wealth.
They all need a sphere.
This is almost certainly too stretch too close to the fish, and certainly for us.
But the absence of some symbolic symbolic sfer to infelicity, teme, teme, for the wildlife --
Thank you very much.
