The year last year, I showed these slide to show that the calculation calculation that for almost three million years had been the size of 48 States of 48 States of 40 percent of the United continents, it's restretched by 40 percent.
This is a subvalitting the gravity of the problem because it doesn't show the beginning.
The calculation is art with a certain sense, the heart of the global climate system.
You can get the winverse and writing and writers.
The next slide will be a rapid rapid on the last 25 years.
The gyack lots are signed in the red record.
You know, you can see it until the blue screen.
That's the ice ice in the winver, which is the glacistrates of summmer.
You can see that the ice, the ice ice ice ice ice ice ice hyth, five years or more, is like the blood -- that this oriesness, which is that the body.
In 25 years was spent of this, at the time to that.
This is a problem because the climate of the arrain the ocean art where there are enormous amount of carbon that you have enormous amount of carbon that I want to get from the microbies.
Rember the totality of the atmospheric inquination from the global warming, that quantity could double, super-range extent that pollution.
In some laghi sea little deep in Alaska metan water is already reboiling from water.

Video: Wow! Al Gore: She's good. The question is if we will be well.
A reason is that this exchange from the north, the lands of the north.
This is a glacial regime glacial regime
She had never reached the similar levels like that.
This is the Kangerlusasic Kangererlusa's west Greenland of the Greenland of the Greenland of the Greenland.
If you want to know how the level of the skets of the ice ice to the sket, here is where the sea level of the sea of skin the sea of skin the sea of sken sket.
These rents are increasing rapidly.
Another part of the planet: Antararcy, the largest block of the planet.
The month, the scientists have dichiped that the white of the ice ice is in negative, and that Antarctics in the Western ones in some island on some islands, is particularly rapid in the shem.

The door is increased.
But when you dimine, the same across the water water potable water.
In California on the Sierra Nevada is diminuth,
The hydrops are in crisis.
The predictions, as you have a lectures, are grave.
The growing of the world door a remarkable increases in the world of incended.
The disasters are increasing a rhythm and without precedented by the normally and without precedent.
Four times more numbers in the last 30 years of the last 30 years of the 75.
This is a whole thing of unsustainable to do that.
If you look at the context of the historical context of the consequences.
In the last five years we added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons of tons in the oceans every day.
Look at the poor of the oriental Pacific Pacific American East Eest, and the bottom of the subside of the continent of the oxygen, where there's a radical imposed in the oceans.
The major of global warming, together with deforestation, which is the 20th of deforestation, which is the use of combines fossil fuels.
The oil is a problem, and the carbon is a problem, and the carbon is even worse than the floor.
The United States are one of the most emission, together with the China.
And he proposed to build a lot of other carbon of carbon and carbon
But we're looking at a shift of direction.
These are the annonothing in the last years, and some of the alternative alternative verdies.
As it in the way, there's a lot of politics in our country.
The carbon and oil industries have spent 250 million dollars in the last year year to promote the carbon to promote the carbon and is a oxyden ox.
This picture reminds me to be --
Nath Natal, in the Tennesse, where I live in the Tennesse, of a 3.8 billion literally carbon of choral carbon of charbon of the Tennesse,
Maybe you saw him on the news.
This is the second largest flow of the America.
It's happened around Natma.
The natalizes of one of the carbon industries was this one.
Video: See Prosty carbon is a basic like and happy.
It's abundant here in America, and it makes our economy.
Frosty carbon is and more and more and more clean.
It's about bubon price, adorables and workers are kept the stick of the stick him.
Al Gore: Does here is a lot of the West Virginia.
The largest society on the mountains is Massey Coal. This is Massey Coal.

Al Gore: So the Alleance for the Proteon the Clim has launched two ness,
This is a bunch of it.
Video: Ator COALery see the climate changes like a set of climate changes like a mine of the business.
So our priority is to invest a great amount of money in a audiencity to make public and confluses the truth, and confluses the truth.
In fact, the carbon is not sport.
We think it is cleaned -- it has a good profum.
So not predictor of climate change.
Let me do you do to us.
Video: Ator -- you heard about -- you heard about a lot of it.
So let's take a gyp in a structure of a framework for the carbon of the carbon the clean to the carbon of the clean to be a broke.
Straordinary cars are a little romoreful, but this is the sound of the carbon technology carbon the technology of charcoal charcoal of charcoal --
The carbon is the major of the main the global warming, but the night technology of the carbon that you see changes everything.
Do a look at the charcoal technology of carbon diox.

The filter that college all of the team: our dependence from the combines of fuels, like the carbon and the oil is for the important.
Now, there's a new audition to usual solution for us.
Repower America: 100th hundred energy in diet,
They like to put the work, to reput America in work, to help us stop, and help the global warming.
Finally, a solution that you have to solve our problems.
Repower America. Scoprinting more.
Al Gore: This is the ultim.
Video: Here is is about to America.
One of the fast ways to bring dependence from the dependence from the combines that kill our planet.
She goes on the future is here. Vent, a new energy network.
She came out of the 2: Nuoves investment for the job of well.
M: Repower America. It's time to be realist.
Al Gore: A old a deal African old African old African old African old old you to go to the money.
If you want to go away to the away together."
We have to go away to the fast.
Thank you very much.
The year last year, I was a deal in the LHC.
And I promise to go back to the way to get back to how machine.
So I got out here. And for those who are not there was no her, the LHC is the biggest scientific experiment -- 27 kilometers of circumstomer circumstomer circumstomer of circumstomer circumstomer of circumstom
Her compiece is to reconditions that were present less than a billion second from the beginning of the universe -- until 600 million times a second.
And all of this is just environment.
This is the Gineva.
We photographs these mini-Big Bang Big Bang Big Bang Big Bang Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big B.
This is what I work. It's called ATLAS -- it's largest 44 feet and has a diameter of 22 feet --
This is a picture of ATLAS image of ATLAS in building so you can see the proportions.
The 10 sets of the last year we have accese, we turn the car for the first time.
And this picture was taken by ATLAS.
It was because of immense festrating in the control of the control.
It's a picture of the first phascise of particles that had made all the gyment of LHC, and by the LHC, and spread particles in the LHC, and spread particles in the levator.
In other words, when we seem that picture 10 set, we understand that the machine work, which is a great life.
I don't know if it was to do that in us to do that, when someone on Google and saw that the pages beginning was this thing.
That means we have had a cultural impact of the scientific impact that scientific impact.
And it was a week later, there was a problem with the machine, just had to these films here -- these films -- these films -- these files.
These files are taking 13,000 prints when the machine works in the power.
Now, the technical technical of you will look at the files and say, "It's not true. I'm files too much under this."
And they can do it because when I'm very quicky become the cosids of the superconvictypes.
So, at the 271 degrees, at a time perfect temperature in the stars, these films can bring that bodies can bring that bodies.
In one of the most of the most of the magnets in the LHC, there was a fabrication.
So the files are surgery and 13,000 feet and 13,000 feet meeting a resistancestimprove resistance.
This was the result.
Now, this is even more impression, if you think these magnets fish over 20 tons and that have been moved about 30 centimeters.
They are damaged about 50 magnets.
We had to get to a touch, what we did we do it.
We have them repristined and add it.
They're now now now now they're going back to the ground.
Enth, the end of the LHC will be new ungrow.
We accenate it, and we expect to get the data or while, and keep so our wind or him, and keep so our adventure to discover what the universe.
Now, of course, in a certain the way, these incident incidents return the value of science and engineering in frontiers. It's easy to confuture it. It's easy to confuture it.
I think that the fact that it is so difficult to go beyond the limits, I think is the value of things like LHC.
I want to conceiving with a scientist Ingless, Humphrey Davy, who, in difense of the inuseful inuseful experiments of his clean was Michael Faray, and said, "No dangerous for the progress of the human mind that ideas that ideas that ideas that the ideas that ideas that ideas that are not in nature, and in nature, and in nature, and in nature, and in nature --
Thank you.
I want to start asking you to get to the point of here, from children, you play the matter matter matter matter with the matter balls.
And as you realize them and reaching them and reaches them and resolve them and resolve them, and you know, and resolve problems and handipulating space.
The spacal reason is deeply to the way we understand the way we understand part of the world around us.
So, by informing informed by using the uses of our interaction with physics, and my consults, and my collaboratory and my collaboratory Jeevan Kalanith, I started asking myself, as we use a computer, instead of the mouse as a computer, instead of the mouse as a hundred digital hours that moves on a hourselves to a physics,
and we can use it to our please?
The question was so interesting that we decided we decided we decided we decided to explore the answer to the answer to the answer to the answer to explore the answer to the answer to the answer to explore the answer to the answer to the answer to the answer to the answer to the answer to the answer to the answer to the answer the answer to the answer to the answer to the answer the answer to the answer.
In poet, a Seef, a Sift-interactive computer in a few words.
In poet, a Seef, a Sift-interactive computer in a few words.
You can move them to move with the hand, they can see the side of them, and they have a wireless.
But more than that, I am physics, as the matter matter as the matter to be simply to be relief to be in it.
The See is the example of a new ecosystem of tools to manipulate the digital information.
And as they get more physics, and as physics, and as the other hand, and as as we can become more physics, and as we can get more physics, as we motion, we can explore and fun and funny and funny different stiles of interaction.
I'm going to start with some simple example.
This See is configured to show the video -- if you including the video -- if you can including it back to the other parts of the other parts of the other parts of the other parts of the back.
These are interactive rings of others.
If you are in the business of what they are around the time.
If they come circumes, they can get a little bit.
If they come circumes, they can get a little bit.
They also have their movement and lination.
We realized that one of the interaction was the unplications of the interaction was able to use the data, "Desors a couple as if it was a liquid.
In this case, we have three Seft-configured sea of green source and I can use them to be in the central central set, where they mistick.
and I can use them for the color, where you mix in the central central central where they mik.
If we can get too much of the way, we can put a little bit of it.
They're also beautiful ches of learn, like language, the mathematics and games where people can try and see the logical things to try and see the immediately.
Now I'm --
This is a Fibonacus that I do with a program.
Here we have a words of words that is half between Scarabeo and Boggle.
Something to every turn in the house of every Siftable, Pratically, at every turn Siftable, and you get a house on every Siftable, and as certain words of a disafe on a dirtable, and you know, the control of the disaster to a dit on a disaster of the diitionary house of the house to the tur
And then after about 30 seconds remissing and a new set of lectures and new possibility to try to get it.
Thank you.
Here's the children came to the Media Lab, I did that I tried them and I gave them a video.
They are pleased a lot of it.
And one of the interesting things about this kind of application is that you don't have to give people a lot of education.
You just say, "Hef of words, and they know what to do.
Here's the other people who try it.
This is our most journey, there is a young bete, there right there,
It actually wanted to get them to implement.
They just were hundred morning for him.
Now, this is a application of a interactive carddrop of a interactive cards.
We wanted to build a tool to learn language in Lui is Felix.
It can inserve new characters in the scene, and the Siftable and their associated associated associated with them.
It can inserve new characters in the scene, and the Siftable and their associated associated associated with them.
And it's doing that the sun.
Video: The sune is sun.
David Merrill: Now has brought a treatment in the scene.
Video: The arancient treat.
By work! Sik!
So I get the Siftable and put them close to get the characters --
Video: Bau!
and inventing their story.
Video: Cao! Ya!
DM: It's a story with the open-open-in-shot story with it.
DM: It's a story with the open-open-in-shot story with it.
Video: Vole, I live it,
DM: The last example I have the time to show you is a tool, realized recently, to execk and exequal music.
it's a tool, realized recently, to field and exeguing music.
The See of the basis of sound like the battery.
Each of these has four different variations, and you can choose what you use it.
You can get these sound sounds a sequence to your feature to your feef to your feet.
And modifiction to just touching a "sound sound like "sound" and a "sequence."
These are effects that you can control from live, as the reverse and the file.
The skacks to a particular sun, and then including it.
And then there are the general effects as time and volum, which is applicating inside sequence.
Look at how it works.
Video: DM: We're going to start a basis in two Sift-sequence, we will get the system, we get the same, we add the other basic things.
I put a bunch of the bottom.
Video: DM: Oh the adding of the percent --
Video: DM: And I'll put the filter filter the filter to the bacteria, so I can control effect from the live.
Video: DM: I can fast the entire sequencing the whole sequencing of the time from the side of the other.
Video: DM: And I'll add the filter filter to give more expression.
Video: I can get the sequence of the sequence to the sequence.
So I didn't have to planning it before, but I can try and make it more and corted.
And now, finally, I can get the whole sequencing the whole sequencing in the left-flying Sef."
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is building new interfaces that are machine machine and more look like our brain and body.
And I had time to show you one of the results of this peror, and some possible possibility that we try to bring out of the lab.
The concept I want to transmit you is that is coming this new generation of objects to interact with the middle media digital media in our world in our world in our world that we want.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the now of talk to you about all of you.
I'm a writing writing.
Something is my profession, but it's more of these, of course of this, of course of course of this.
It's also the love and the love of my life.
And I don't expect that can change it.
But I said that, something particular happened to my life and my career, and my career, that has brought me to realibrate the whole reality with this work.
The particular thing I recently recently this book, this book, this book, this book, the Prega, Ama" -- the different than my previous previous -- for some reason for some reason for the world and became a big interational interational interaction.
And the result is that everywhere from now, people are treating me as if I was convicted.
By -- convicty, convict!
They come from me and say, "You can't fear and say, "You can't fear more than do I can't fear more than do that?
You can't afraid to continue to write for all life without could be able to create a book that can be able to create a book that can be able to someone?"
that can be to matter someone?"
It's resure that, you know.
But it could go worse and worse that I remember 20 years ago, when I started to say people -- I was a adolescent -- I was a writing write -- I wanted to be a write writing.
I meeting against the same reaction of the country.
And people say, "Don't be able to have success?
Do you fear that the upon hurt you kill,
You can't fear of do this mester mester for all life without any life without any life that comes out of the disease of disease with the mouth of love of falling?"
You know, you know.
The answer -- the short answer to all of these questions is, "Se."
I fear of all of those things.
I had always been fear of the country.
And I also have a lot of other things that people could not have to be it.
As a other things and other things --
But as I think about the writing what I thought and I asked myself to be ultimally why is?
Is it it do?
It's logic, whoever you can wait to be speaking from a job that you feel from a job that you feel to do.
But what is that particular in the impresequal creative to make us realize the health of the mind of the other career than other career not do that?
As my father, for example, he was a chemistry and I don't remember a time in his 40 years of activity in which he was asked if he was afraid to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be able to get the
It never -- that that block John, like the Engineer John, like that?
It didn't work like this, capity?
Onestly, the engineers as group as group as group don't have certainly in the century of being alcohype of being alcohyaces of manaces in depressed manacks.
We have enough of the reputation, and not just writers but creative writers but creative creative to be enormously unstable to be enormously instables forward.
And it's not going to look at the tristers of the disease of magnitude magnitude of magnitude magning, only in the 2th century, and often for them.
And the ones that you don't have suicide seem to be really disagreed by their woms.
Norman Mailer, before I did, in the last interview said, "Ognes my book broken me a little bit of a little bit of a little bit about the work of life.
But we don't get that the way we feel about because we heard these things so long as we can completely interior that we have completely interior and accepted the notion and suffering the notion and suffering the art, and it will always get to the angoods.
And the question I want to ask all of the today is, are you agree with this idea?
It goes you have to be this -- because it looks from a centimeter of distance to me not good for anything this suppose --
I think it's hodiose.
And I think it's also dangerous and I don't want to see perpetuated in the next century.
I think it's better to be better encourage our big minds creative to live.
And I know that in my case -- in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to become out of the burban supposed to be a lot of data that I have in my career.
Obly lood -- I look at it, I'm quite young and I have about 40 years.
I have about four decadecades in me.
And it's very likely anything that I will write to be right now will be judged by the world as I suspect after the work that I was going to be right after my last book.
I'll be squary, because we're all all or friends here -- it's probably likely my greatest success is to my bang of my spines.
Oh, Gesus, that you think of it!
You know, this is the kind of thinking that brings a person to begin to the nine morning and I don't want to do it.
I would keep doing this work that we do.
So, the question becomes do?
And so I seed that, after many reflecsions, that the way to work for keep to keep a psychological psychological costructure, right?
I have to find a distance of safety in me, which I am writing, and my natural natural reaction that I wrote the pocket that I wrote the year of the way I started to look through the time to do this through the time, trying to find other society to see if they could have the more ideas and seeing more society and healthy to see if they could have the most of ideas and healthy as and healthy as and healthy as I write and security to the more of the best ideas as and san.
how to help people creative to creativity the risks emotional risks emotion.
And that research has taken me to the Great and Roma.
Seguits, because I gave it back and then back.
No Grecise and Rome -- people don't seem to believe that creativity came from humans, OK?
He thought the creativity was this is about the wind and that came to divine and sevener to a few surgery, for reasons and unknown for distants and unknows it.
The greglass called these divines of creativity of creativity of the demonith."
Socrate, wonderful belief that he was created to have a demon that elate wisdom,
The Romans were the idea, but they called the kind of spirit without a genius.
The who's the great because the Romans didn't think a genius, they didn't think a genius.
They reduced that a genius was this kind of divince that was living in the walls of a artist, a little bit like the pho Dobby, and that came out of hide assister of the arms of the artist, and model, the work of the work.
Excitional -- this is the distance of which is -- that psychological psychological psychological psychological that is from your work.
And everyone knew that was so that it worked, right?
So the antic artists were prots, like the narrow of certain thing, right?
If your work was exceptional -- you can't get all the market, everybody knew that was helped by this genius.
If your work work fally, it was not all of your own work, right?
Everybody knew that was your genius, to be a unable to be a incapace.
And so the people who han creativity in Occident for a long time.
And then Rinachieved and changed this great idea; we put this great idea; we put the human being in the center of the universe and no longer and no longer and no longer and no longer and no longer and no longer to the divinity.
This was the principle of human excity and people began to think that creativity came completely from the hyselling creativity came completely from the ish.
And for the first time in history, you begin to refer this argu's argu's like a genius, as a fairly than a genie.
And I have to tell you, I think was a big herror.
I think allowed to someone simple person, believe that it can be like a source of being like a source and the sisters of all the mysteries and the hours of all of the divince and etherns is a film that is a film that human.
It's like to ask someone to play the sun.
Deform and histor, and creates all these ingestible ingestive and creates all these expectations on performance.
And I think it was this pressure to destroy artists in the pasts of the pasts in the pasts of the past.
And if this is true, and I think it is the question, and now, and no?
Can we different with it?
And I think I was going to go back to a more ancient understanding of the human relationship between human relationship.
Or maybe no.
Maybe we can't cancer 500 years of rational thinking about a 18 minutes.
And there are probably people in the audience that would be suspected suspects on the notion that they follow people to follow the people who are following successful ones of them projects.
I don't probably you don't have to convince you all about this thing.
But the question I want to ask is -- why is that?
Why don't you think about this way?
Because it has more sense of every thing that ever ever ever heard to explain the creative process.
A process that I ever tried to do something -- so foundly fundamentally, you don't get rational.
And, in fact, it can sometimes completely paranormal looking.
I did this meeting with the extraordinary poet, and I was in the poeter Ruth Stone, who was a poetched poet, and he said that during his childhood in the Rural Virginia, working out of the field, and I felt it in the field, and I heard the wind of the exist.
He said that it was like a trage track of air track --
And he came rotate to her landscape.
It was going to get to get the ground under the ground underneath his feet.
She knew about to have one thing to do to that point and he was saying, "Look like a morn."
And so he was going to get to the house and was followed by this poetry poet, and he would not have to get a piece of paper and a fairly in the past, as the translate of the page.
Sometimes he couldn't be enough to be quicked, so corrected and corrected and wouldn't be able to get into the house and the poetry roten through and she would kept through the landscape, and she would continue to roten through the landscape, "another poet."
And then there were those times -- this piece doesn't forget him -- there were no time -- there were the moments that was almost lost, OK?
So, he was running at home and was looking for the card and the poetry was looking through a basis and further, and then he was going to go through the other hand and then said, that it was like the other hand and the Eightened and the Eighten.
And the coda and the coda from the coda and reputed the head and turned on the page.
And in these cases, the poetry would be presented on the perfect and intacting and intact around the first of the first of the word to the first before.
So when I feel him -- it's crazy equal to my process.
Not my own creative process -- they're not a convict!
I'm a mule, and my way to work is to work and go to the same order every day and sweet, and south and go over and go to the beautiful and go over and go on and go over the goding.
But even I wise, in my head, I slightly meeting that thing,
And I imagine that many of you have a lot of you do it.
You know, if the job work and ideas and ideas and ideas and ideas I could not have a certain source.
And what is this thing?
And how can we relate to that in the way to not do us to lose your head, which makes us sanish?
For as I remind, the best example of me that I have is the Tom Waits, which I interview different years ago for a day.
We were talking about this, and you know, Tom, and you know, Tom, for the magical artist of life was the incarnation of the artist of the artist of the clean these kind of clean enory.
But then he was hot and a day he was driving on a day carefully on the highway to Los Angeles, changed all for him.
He was going to be fast and all of a tract track of melodia, that comes into his head, which is inspiration, and the wants to be and extincting, and the wants to get out of the wish and the desire and desire to take it.
It has no piece of paper, it has no mathemity, it has no mathematic.
So it begins to feel this kind of old old old old old old that you to lose and remarried by this song of a lost of this song song along this song allow.
I'm not enough I can't do it."
And instead of go to the panic panic painted up.
I'll go to the whole mental process and did something completely new it.
And he looked at the sky and said, "Scuse, you can't see that I'm dying to the sky of I'm driving it?"
"To you seems that can write a song hour?
If you really want to exist, I get back to a little bit of a time when I can take care of you.
Some of the other other today.
You go to the Leonard Cohen."
And his working process of changed after that.
Not the work was still dark as a set as you pretty much.
But the process, and the fish anks that attemptor, the genius was released when the genie, the genius, the genius, and free it turns out of where I came to the back, and realizing that he had no thing to be a whole thing and mented.
but well-culiar beautiful conversation of a conversation between Tom and this thing is not Tom. And this thing that allowed was not Tom.
So I feel that history begin to change a little bit of a way I was already and saved me a time.
This idea, saved when I writing "Mangia, Prega, Ama," and I fall of the disperation of those dispersing in the sken of the disperation where we are working on something and begin to think that that that the worst is going to be the worst of the worst write.
Not just bad the worst written book written --
And I began thinking of designing this project.
But then I remind me of Tom that talked about the air and trilled.
So I got my face on the handle of the handled and I would say, my comments to a nice of the room of the room.
And I said high you, "Yes, and both both and I feel that if this book is not going to be brilliant not going to be brilliant not going to be brilliant not be yno?
Because as I see I am am doing all I haven't more than that.
So if you want to be better, you have to represent you and do your party.
Okay. But if you don't do anything about it, I don't do anything.
I'm going to write the same because my work.
And I would like to favor that I today I have today I realized to do my talk, because of the U.K. -- the end is so like this, in the deserts of the North people rade in the desert of the dances and the sacross the dances and the sacross the hours and the hours and the hours and the hours and until hours and the hours of the alf.
And they were always magnific because the ballers were professional and they were fantastic and they were fantastic.
But every one of the time, it was something happened, and one of these artists became to reality in fact,
And I know what I know about it, because I know that you all have been all of a point, a lose of of it.
It was as if you stopped and the ballerining walking through a kind of lap, and he was not doing nothing of different from the solitself, like 1,000 night before, but you were all of the 1,000 night before, but everything you would have to be --
And suddenly not as a human hand.
But you access to the below below and under the divinity of divinity.
And when this happened to the them, the people who knew what was, they were called his name.
They were swalking and begin to a single "Ah, Doh, God God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God,
That's God, you know.
She had name a historic, when the Morth, I would preserve this habity, and they preserve this habited history of the changed centuries in the century of the "Allah, Allah," which you can still feel in the corride or the flew of the corries or the flew of the sources of the sought in the south.
In Spay -- when a artist did something impossible and magic -- oh, oh, oh, oh, be, bad, bad, you know, bee," incomprehensible -- a foot of God.
And it's great because we need.
But the problem comes the day down, the ballerine, when you get away when you get away and discovers that are the 11 of Martedday and last of God is not more.
It's just a death, with the death of the knes and maybe it can't be even more to the hidden to that altheist alist in the wall.
And maybe no one will be the named God even while I go to the rest of his life?
It's difficult.
This is one of the most dolorous reconciliations from a creative life to a creative life
But perhaps not to be so angood-force if you can not believe it, and the most extraordinary extraordinary to your or be being from you to yourself.
But believed that they just get from a source of this source of this squisite that squisite that you have to get somebody else when you fine.
And, you know, if we think of this change.
And so I began thinking about it, and it's surely as I thought about a different months during the work of the book that I'm going to public in the book that I'm going to be a very much dangerous, the followed of my big success.
And what I have to keep in the rect when I feel electric feel from this is, I don't have paper.
Don't be argues.
He reflies to the you, whatever you can be.
If your work is ball, ball, ball.
If the divine, you know, I would ask you decided to get some kind of beautiful beautiful time through your efforts of your efforts through your efforts of your efforts of being, "Ole!"
On triments, do the same dance.
And "Ole!" to yourself.
I think I have to become to teach it.
"Ole!" to yourself, even for you, just for love and heading a human talks to to you to get your own own own own own own own own own own own own own love and textbox.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
As you know I've been talked about some of these projects on the human genome, on what can meaning and discovered again.
Now we're starting a new lose of it, we started to begin to digitalize biology and now to start from that code digital code of biology, we're going to get into a new phase of biology, designing and synthetic lives.
We always tried to do a big questions.
"What is the living is something that many biology have been trying to figure out to levels.
We tried to be approach, reducing it to the minimes of terms.
We're digitalized by almost 20 years.
When we sequenced the human genome was going to go from the world from the analogical world of the biology of the computer.
Now we asked us to regenerate new life from this digital universe from this digital universe from this digital?
This is the map of a little organism, the Mycoplasma parent, which is the species from the smallest genome of the genome of those who can autoreplicated into the laby.
And we tried to reduce the genome to create a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit more than that.
We are able to eliminate a hundred genes of about 500 genes of the around 500 who are here.
But when we look at his map to his map metabolic map of the metabolic to the now.
See here, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can elimine, one at the time, it's very unlikely to get a vidence that this can bring a live.
So we decided that the only via to progress to progress this chromosomes so that we could modific modifiction to make some of these questions.
And so we started the winning of the "We can synthetic a chromother?"
Can chemistry of producing these big molecules that we never ever could create before we have never been able to create before?
And, in case of the movie of the movie cromosom is?
A cromosome is just a piece of material material material material material of it.
The speed that we are able to digitalize the life is growing to exponential exponential of the exponential that we are able to delive.
Our capacity of write the genetic code of genetic descenes, but it's better at it.
And our most results the results the door to a exponential curve.
We started over 15 years ago.
The process has requires a lot of past, beginning with a biothic revision before we begin the first experiments.
But we found that synthesize DNA is very difficult.
There are decades of thousands of cars in the world that are producing little center of DNA, of the long equality of 30 to a degenerative process of degenerative and is a lot of degenerative feeding is longer ger than the segments of the world that are going to be there.
And so we had to develop a new metom to assemble these fragments and rect the games and rors.
And this was our first tent, in fact, to particular digital information of Phi 174.
It's a little viruses that kills batter.
We have designed the fragments, effect the correction of the errors and get a molecule, about 5,000 letters.
The interesting part of this piece of chemical material material of material material and we put it in the battery bacteria have began to reading this genetic code and produce the viral particles that genetic particles viral particles in viral chemical material of virals and virals.
The virals are then released by the cell phones, are background and they distruck E.
I talked about recently with recently oil industry says that they have certainly understanding this model.
They have more than you.
We think this is a situation where the software can really building its own hardware in a biological system in a biological system in a biological system that the software can really build his hardware of the such of the biological system can really build its own hardware in a biological situation system that the sof
But we wanted to do things in the big things in the big things.
We wanted to build the whole chromosome.
I'm more than 580 milecture of code code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code.
So we thought of building it in the size of viruses that we could change the cassets to understand what the cassets are a living cell.
The projection is crucial and if we start with digital information in a computer, these are must be very accurate to be very accurate to be very accurate to be very accurate with digital information in a computer, these are dealthy digital information in a computer, these are must be very accurated.
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 the accuratezy was a midle of a midle error.
We found out of that, 30 her, 30 errors. If we had been used that original sequence, we would never be able to do it.
One part of the process is to design, and the 50 letting along the 50 letting of the 50 lectures of 50 lectures to build underunit to build underunit together.
We can do the elements here.
You probably have read that we read that we put us of the phylig.
Think of this is the way we have a genetic code genetic code of the letter: A, C, and T.
Three of those letting in the basis of the middle about 20 frightened lectures of lectures for every lominoacid of the load.
So we can use the genetic code to write words, though though.
What we did about the beginning was automo-a-a-
Some of them were deluses from the fact that it was not exactly poet.
We have designed these segments for simply to unique,
There are gass that they repaid them and put them and put them together.
And we started to assembling the parts, beginning with seven seven to seven mile seven to seven out of 24 miles away to them to 24 miles to get to 72 miles the lectures of the literally to get to 72 my letter to sell 72 my letter.
And every step we produced these segments in abundance so that we can sequencing that we're trying to create a tremendous proception, as you will see in a minute.
We're looking for the process.
So, this seems the tabon a basis of a basis of a basis of a basis of a basis of a basis of a basis of a baket.
When we get to these segments very long, 100 miles down, the more degrees are going to growth in the E. colands.
You get to the limb tools of the molecular biology of molecular biology.
So we have considered other mechanisms.
We knew about another mechanism called "recombination of homology, which in biology to reparate DNA degrees to repart DNA to the seats of the seats.
Here's a example.
This organism, called Deinococcus radio durans, it can be aware three million radiation.
You can see in the soft require as his chromosomes became to destroyed.
In 12 -- 24 hours is reassembled exactly as it was before.
They are thousands of organisms that are able to do it.
These organisms you can just totally be in the set.
They can live under the vacuum to get below it.
I'm absolutely sure that life exists in space, and you get to find new environments of water the water environments of water.
At the NASA showed that this avview that this aven.
This is a picture of the molecules that we built using processes, just using the life-drug designed design.
The lievise of the automatically lievil.
This picture was not taken with a microscope with a electronic microscope.
It's a molecules that we can see it with a microscope with a law.
These are photos that cover a period of about six seconds.
This is the published that we did a little time ago.
I'm 580,000 letting code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code code.
It's the biggest molecules that we ever created by man.
It has a weight molecular heavy on the 300 million hons.
If we were steping with a 10 carefully carefully page to get this genetic code this genetic code of this genetic code of genetic code of this genetic code of a character.
Now, how do we work that work? How can we active?
Obviously, you travel a viruses is a young player.
It's a little bit complicated when you use batter.
It's even as simpler than the eucarios as well as our res: you can just extract the nuclean nuclean nucleum the process of clonation.
In the bacteria archaea the chromosome, is integrated into the cells, but we recently have recently demonstrated that we are able to do a complete trapiece of a cell and active from a cell and active it.
We can have a bunch of a microbial species from a species of a microbial species
The two are are different than men of the men are from the touches of the men are of the men are of the men of the men are of the two of the men are of the men of the men are of the two are men of the men are of the men are of the men are of the men of men are of the men of men are of the men of men are that men of men are of
We have added some gene in a little bit of a way that I could decide what choose to this chromom for this chromom
The he's got slight-to-suming with the proteins.
And when we put it in the cellum was stuff -- and you will appreciate our soffistic, the new chromosomes is going to the cellule.
And we begin thinking we can't go to become to become to become to the beat in there.
This is one of the most exectric mechanisms of evolution.
We found that many species have added a second or a second or a third of a few hundreds of new hand, added in a second hundreds of new tracks to that species.
So who think of evolution as a gene of the time that modific is not understood that modific biology.
They have been called the restrial restrial science is that further digerish the DNA.
The chromosome, it was in the cell phone --
The cell phones the cromosomes that we insert ha.
And it turns out to the other chromosome, and it recognized the other cromosome, and we found out with only the cells and the new cromom and the new cromom and the new cromom and the new cromode.
it became blue because of the genes we have inserts.
And in a short of time, all the characteristics of a species are along a kind of a new species of the new species, and it turned out to the new software that we put in the cells.
All the proteins are changed, the members are changed, and when we read the genetic code genetic code of what we have transfer to you.
Now, this could seemy alchemiia alter, but altering the software DNA we can change the things in enough support things in the enough of the software in a such chemistry of this may seemy alternal altern.
Now, I explain that you don't talk about genesis -- but to progress from three million years from from three million years and a half years of evolution, and I said that maybe we're going to create a new version of the Cambrian explosion of this digital process of digital process of digital process.
Why do I think of that?
I think it's enough obvious when we think about our needs needs to our needs.
We're going to spend six billion people to nine billion people to 90-year-old.
I'm born to give a example: I was born in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for each one in 1946, in 1940 years, there will be four years,
We're going to find food, water and clear water and clean water and clean ban, and banks, and a half billion people.
It will be more harder to do it for nine billion.
We can get more than five billion carbon of olide carbon of olid.
That means a hundred million barrines a day.
When I look at a biological process, or any kind of process to replace to replace them, it will be a huge challenge to be a huge challenge to be a huge challenge of a processes.
And the more we have to keep the whole of CO2 emission of CO2 of these materials that finishes in the atmospher.
At day day of the today, thank you to scientific discoveries in the world, we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I like to think that are the designed for the future.
The electronic industry has only a dozen dozen of components, and think about how many things are coming out of them.
Our limits here are data from the reality and our imagination.
We have now now now with these techniques, thanks to these synthetic metoh.
We are able to build a big robots that can produce a robot that can produce a million hundred chromosomes.
Think of these 20 million genes or a different genes or to try to get the processing processes to make a lot of different drugs, new vaccines, we can change and make more biology biology and create biology in molecular science.
And it's just a stand-stand-selection.
We can choose to choose survival of surviving, chemistry, production chemistry, production of vaccines --
This is a few software sustaining that we're working on that we're working for seats to set us and designing species to computer.
Well, we don't know necessarily how they will be no.
We know exactly what their genetic code is their genetic code.
Now we're focusing on the carbon of quarter generation.
You see you also saw you to extent the fat was a bad experiment in the bad of the further.
We have a second and third generation that will be using enough to be pretty much as a zero zero-burant charge or different kinds of butanol.
But the only way that biology can have a great impact without major major major the food of the food and limited the CO2 in the materials would be transform CO2 in materials that we are working for the cell that they can get the cells that can reach this discover, and we think of it could get the first carbon a matter than 18 months.
The sunlight with the CO2 is a metodom -- but in our discoveries in the world, we found different metodi.
This is a orgism that we described in 1996.
It lives in the ocean deep about 2500 feet feet of the water perature of water water the water boildlife
It rees the CO2 using molecular energy as a molecular energy source of energy.
We're trying to understand if we can put CO2, that can be transported to be transported by the CO2 in the CO2 in the urant, to driving this process.
So that brief of the things that we could be able to increase what the basis of what the basis is Noe, true, truth, true, truth, we have the oil to repirate the whole industry.
Exactly. If you can't do it TED, where can you do that?
It would become a major energy source of energy.
And in fact, we're working for using the same metods to create vaccines to create vaccines.
You saw this year with influence, we're always back, we are always back, and a dollar in less when you treat least when you treat the right vaccine vaccine it.
I think that you can change combinable in the ancient vaccinable to ant.
Here's how the future could begin to look at change, the tree of evolution, accelerating evolution, acceling with synthetic bacteria and infinally indeed, and infinally cells.
We are so from the best people.
Our discover is to make enough long enough to try to do it. Thank you very much.
First of all I will see the most quickly possible, some fundamental work that we have let to Microsoft in to Microsoft in a water in a year factor.
It's a environment that you can interact is a local level that remote from a huge amount of data visual data from visual data from visual data --
And this is a lot of gabyte photos of photos with a kind of digital zoom and continue, to a speed of bread, say, to be able to images like we want to do.
And it doesn't matter how big we see how big we see that we see it, as big data or the images.
Most are communicules from the digital photographs -- but this for example, is a provention from Bilibrary of Congress, and reaches in the gamm of 300 megame.
Not a difference because the only thing that limited the prestations of a system like this is the number of a system of the system in any moment. It's also an architecture that is also a very flexible architecture of a very flexible until that is a very flexible undress of a system like this is the num
This is a book inter, example, of data not images.
This is the Casa desolated Dickens. Every desolated by a capitly.
And so that is about a textbook and not images, we can do a little bit of think, to see really that it's a representation of a representation of the textbook, not a photo.
It could be a little bit of artificial book for a book of electronic book
You don't look at it.
This is a more realistic example of the Guardian.
Each image is the beginning of a section.
And it will really give you the pleasure and beautiful experience of a news of a quotidi, which is for nature of a quotidi, which is for nature of a very theist.
We also did something with the corner of this particular number of the Guardian Look in the Guardian angle of this particular number of this particular number of this particular number of this particular number of this particular number of this particular number of the Guardian.
We created a high advertising high resolution -- much higher than what you use in a normal, and we had inserted you in a public content -- and we had inserted you of the content -- and we had inserted you to the extra.
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile, you can see here.
Or other models, or even specific specific specific specific models, or even specific specific models, or even even the other models, or even the other models, or even the other models, or even even even the models, or even even the models, even the models, or even even the models, even even the
And this really demonstrate shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of the screen.
We hope that this means to put a little bit, and other porks, and other parents, not to be necessary.
Of course, the map applications is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology.
And I don't want to lose the time, if not to say that we have contributes from giving this field.
These are all the streets in the U.S. ob-obpaatial image of NASA.
So now we go to something else.
This is actually from the websk-vie; you can go to the webset.
It's a project called Photosynth, which is two different technologies.
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual research of the very interesting of the University of Washington of Washington with the aid of the Washington of the Microsoft Resear. And Resear. Szeliski Resear. Some Resear. She is a collaboration.
And it's from Seadragoned by Seadragon.
You can see this kind of screen when we do this kind of screen to the other and have this kind of experience to have this kind of experience.
But the collocaon the pictures here has actually a meaningful.
The computing algorithms of the computing have made these pictures together, so that they recording to the real slight-to-cliffs in the Grashes on the Grashes on the Montages -- have been taken from the churches of a slidests of a slidestly bread, and these things are all of a slidest-visualization of a space.
I don't know if I have time to show you some other environment.
There's some much more space.
I want to spend directly one of the original data from Noah-- and this is from a previous patterns that we did work for the first time -- to show you what we did work, for the first time the first time -- to show you what I think I think about the key is really the key to the clear, the clearly evidence of the environment, and it's not necessarily to see the environment. And it's not necessarily looking at the website of the weet original environment.
We had to worry about legal ways, and saw down.
This is a rebuilding in the Chedral Notre Dame pictures from Flickr. Basta digitating Noth and you get images of the field of the field of the field of the field of the field of the field of the field of the arances that is a picture that you have been discovered to this model.
So I am all pictures from Flickr and were all colleged to space, in this way.
And it's possible to navigate in this simple.
You know, I would never think of finish to work for Microsoft.
It's very gratificial accool here.
I think you can see that it's a lot of different kinds of fun photos of photos from the cell phones of the phones of the cell phones of the photos of the photos of the photos of the photos of the photos of the photos of photos --
And if you can get to look at those strange strange and look at the sket.
Many are are blocked, etc., etc., etc.,
Something is a series of photographs -- exham.
This is a Notare Dunk poster Damam's Runclearly in the record.
We can go from the poster of the physics of this environment.
The essential point is that we can do things with the social environment. This is now taking from the entire memory of views of how to appears -- and collect all of the data together.
All those photos become college of the particular set of the particular squares.
You have a model, the entire that emerge.
Think of this as the Stephen Lawler work,
It's something that grows in complexity as people using the people using that people useful us.
Their photographs are marched by other people.
If you get to someone is the idea of the contrast all these synthrows from the name of Notre Damames of Notare suddenly requires of all those dates, and I can use the spoint of everybody else, and I can use the photos of anybody else, and having a little social experience, and having a social experience of the kind of a little social excross-user social experience, my pictures of the kind of a sket-user.
Of course, a consequence of all of this is virtual models of the Earth, collective of the Earth, collective and images -- and by images and images -- but the memory of the collective and the memory of collective and the collective of the planet.
Thank you very much.
CA: I understood that what your software is that your software to do is that at some point, in the next years, all the photographs shares shared from anyone in the world will be practically college that you can have a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the world will be practically college with that?
BA: Yeah. What's doing is in practice is discover.
It's creating the hyperlink if you want to stand images.
And it's doing the bottom of the images.
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the weith, that many of these images that many of these images possibly images that are possibly interesting --
As when you make a research of the web, you tell a web, and the head on the web page, has a lot of information about the pictures.
Now, what happens if that pictures you all of your photos do it?
So the amount of interconnection seeds and the amount of recycle that is really enormous set, it's a slump effect of the net.
CA: Blaise, it's really incredible. Compliments.
BA: You thank you very much.
One of the main of the major delientis of the research of the etngraphics is the power of the antic research of the antic research of the antic research of the past, the touches of the plants.
Basti thinking that sciancient slide along the Vily Lattea, or that the myths of the ancient is still hyth, or that in Himalaya, the buddy of the Dharmaster of the anthropolicy of the anthropoloy, and remind the importance of the anthropoloy, and that idea that we don't see the world that the world we live not exist, but it's just a model of reality of reality of reality, but it's just a model, it's just a model of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world we see the world in the world that we see the world of the world that we don't have to realth,
the consequence of a particular choices that our stirps that our stirps have done that, so much generations ago.
And, of course, all of the essential tracks, of course of essential tracks.
We all all of it. Everybody all of it.
We are subjected to the beginning of beginning to begin to be subjects.
We have to deal the death inexors of death, so you don't surprising and whales we have to ballost.
We all have a art of art.
What you have the sken is the realm of the song of each culture.
Not matter that are the CEExide or the Borneo, or the following Haiti, or the Kair desert in Kair desert in Kenya settery of the Sahara.
He was my own own own journey in desert a month ago, or a yak in the vallor, on the games of Qomolangma, on the mother of the world.
All these populations teaching us that there are other ways of thinking about other ways to think, other ways of thinking about moves in the world.
And if you reflect a mom, it's a concept that can give you hope.
Insident mattriades of cultures the world a life that becomes to the planet and cultural life that has fly the planet and is important for the bend of the planet as a biosphering as a biological rains.
And you can think of this rather cultural as a cultural ethnos: and you can define the ethnose the ethnose of all the concepts, dreams, ideas, the dreams, inspirations, intuitions to be from the imagination of the consciousness.
The ethnos: The fantastic patrimonurimonument.
It's the symbol of what we can be in as a kind of inquist inquisitive to do.
And because the biosphere was free to be able to consumed high is going to the ethnose and purposes too much more quickly.
No biologist, for example, it would say 50 percent of all the species was or on the extinction of the extinction of the biological diversity -- in the most apocal, in the most apocal, and you can't even get news of the biological diversity -- the cultural diversity -- that the cultural diversity -- that the cultural diversity -- that the cultural diversity -- that the cultural diversity -- the cultural diversity of the cultural diversity --
The indict of all of this is, of course, the language.
When you're born, you were born, they were born,
One language is not just by a vocabolary or from a vocabolary or from a lax.
One language is the human spirit of human spirit spirit of human spirit spirit spirit of language.
It's the mean that the animo animo culture comes into the material world in the material.
Each language is a forest, a thinking of mind, a thinking of spiritual chance of spiritual chance of spiritual chance of spiritual chance of spiritual chance of mind, a thinkers.
And those 6,000 languages, while we are sat at Monterey, at least half the half of the children.
They don't get more teached to children, which means you don't field that doesn't field that they already dead.
What is more than being sad than being fly by the sket, of being the last to talk a language of the beings of the wisdom or anticipate the promise of the children, or ancient ancestors of the children,
This is the state of a few weeks in some part of the world every two weeks of the world every two weeks a bag and with sets in the tombs of a anguguguguguguguguy.
And I know that someone of you will say, "Is it not better like that?
The world would not be a better place, if we talk about the same language?" Well, we talk to the same language. We talk all yoruba.
We talk to a kogi.
Scover a tract of what you want, you can't talk about your language.

We take one of the most interesting tribes that I lived with whom I lived in the World Worancer, a incredible popular popular that has had the first contact in 1958.
In 1957, five missionary missionary mission of a comprehense of a fact that we have a facal herror.
They made out of the photographs that were retased in the photographs that were retending that this population population had never seen anything about the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of birthal birth.
They have been collected the photos from the Earth, they have a shape or a figura -- they don't find out that it was diavole, and they killed that the diavole, and they killed the five of the five of the five of the mission with the size of the sket.
But the Waorans don't just kill the strangers.
They knew between them.

We are saved to eight generations and we found two hours of natural death and when we met for saying, they loved that one of them was a mind that it was dead, and then they killed him by the way. And then they killed him at all.

Very interesting.

Maybe some of you have heard about ayayax, the most powerful psychoactive repertor of the sciamanic repertor sciamanic repertor of the sciamanic repertor of you have heard about the ayayay of the squarter.
What makes it fascinating the ayaxy is not the potential of sustance, but his elaboration. It's composed by two elements. It's composed by two elements.
On one side, this liana who's a series of beta-carbine, harmine and harm, lawer and hardly hallucinogen.
Prenth the only further is a fuel that alter, and it a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the family of the family of the coffee of the coffee of viridis.
This plants connected, very similar to the servotonine, very similar serotonina, dimetho-memetho-mememetho-mememetho.
If you ever see the Yanomami to the nose the sustances that do from a different set of species, which is a different species, and that same memean oxietime memethodamine.
To that pole on the nose of the nose is a little bit like being sparated by a pinety pinets and land on a type of electricity. Risate; it creates a distory of reality. It creates the reality. It creates the reality.
I was often with my professor, Richard Evan Shultes, the man who has scated, the man who has done the psychedelic, with his psychedelics in the '30s in the '30s in the '30s in the '30s in the '30s in the '30s in the '30s in the '30s in the '30s in the '30s in the '0s in the '30s in the '0s in the '30s in the '0s in the '30s the '0s,
Second my testhesis you can classific these triptamine triptams like hallucinogens because if you're not going to tell anybody to be absolutely because they can't be absolutely because they're money to be absolutely because they're money to an aware of a classifish.
It's possible to assumers only if you make it suns with other sustances that are the MAO.
Now is the beautiful better, the better, which is in this books, the same kind of the MAO, the same kind of needs to potentiate trips. The question of the smiles to be in a floor, like these popules to find two death, as they do a little bit of a biochemistry death, they create a biochemistry that is that if you get a very biochemistry that is that you can see a very be?
We use the great euphemism of proof of the proof and herror, that can reveal infror,
But if you ask Indians, they will tell us "The plants speak to us."
What does that mean?
This tribes -- Cof, the Cofan, 17 variety of ayayax, which are nice in the forest, and that the eyes would be in the same species.
If you ask them how they are stablish their tassons will tell us about it, "I think I was thinking about it, I think, "No."
The solution is to get 17 variety in a night of a piena and each night and each night with a different tune.

Now, the problem is that the problem is that the ones of us who have to be heart the indigens of the history of the history of the history of the world reality to our world and past.
In fact, the 20th century, 300 years, it will not be remember for his technology, but rather than the technologies, but rather as the technologies, but rather like the one that we stopped and we have been accepted and habarms the destruction of the biological diversity and the problem is not change.
All cultures through the century are involved in a dance for new possibility of life.
And the problem is not technology.
Indians Sioux doesn't stopped to be Sioux when they put out of the argus are not stopped to be Americans when they stop out of Americans and caless.
It's not the change or technology that they threat the integrity of the ethnow. It's the power.
The domination.
And if you look at the world, you will find that these are not cultures that these are not destiny deed to disappear.
They're living and dynamics and dynamics out of identifiable forces that go beyond their ability.
And I think you can see the patric of the guys --
a popular nice now, in Sarawak, in the south of a popular that has lived in the forest, and now reduced to a generation of a generation of the service and product on the service of the rivers, where you can see the river, where you can see the river, the horse of the book in the Mar Corneo Can East in Mar Cinese Mery Can East in the Mers, where the hors is the orizoness,
print you to get the stick of the undertract with the undertract to forest.
Or in the case of the Yanom, are the diseases that are coming with the discover.
If we go to the Tibet, where I'm doing a lot of research where I'm doing a lot of research of politics.
As you know the genocide of a population, the physics of a popul, is convicted to the universal level, but the east, the dio of a popul, not just convicted, but addicted, but addicted, but addicted, because it does part of the development.
And you can't understand the suffering of Tibet until you get from the bet bet to the beginning.
I have lost the 6,000 miles from China Western Cina in the Western Cina to the Tibet with a young young in Lhasa young and I got to realize what we heard about it.
6,000 world, and the class of the wind and ceneres.
1.2 million people killed from military Revolution.
The father of this guy was ascrited to the Panchen Lama.
which means that it was killed to the Chinese invasion.
Hoo he was fugee with Santity during the diaspora that has led the popular in Nepal.
His mother was imprisoned and his colp, and his colp, was to be re.

A day has a day hungry hot a piece of Mao, a rabor of Mao, for this transgressiven years.
The Tibet of Tibet can be unable, but the spirit of the population is from hundred is from hundred present.
And then you get to the end of a choice.
We want to live in the world of the world, or we want to get the world policy-world world policy?
The great anthropologist, before the Margaret Mead, before her ahead was that, in our modition of our world, we don't just see the whole gamm of human imagination of human imagination of the human imagination of the human imagination of the human imagination of thinking about it, but a day we can see it as possible.
And it's ur to remind that our species is existed for 600,000 years.
The Rvolution in Neolitic, who has given us the agriculture, which has done to the seed cult of the seeds of the skin the skin with the prosthetic skin the sket, and we talk about 10,000 years ago.
The modern world industrialized in the 300 years.
And that is a slide story that we have the answers to all the challenges that we have to do the squeen to come to the thousands of the thousands of the thousands of .
When these are the world asking cultures of the world is asked what you want to say to be human to 10,000 voices to 10,000 voices.
And it's in these answers that we all all answer the chance of being what we are. A consciousnes: a consciousness, which has to do that all the popules and all the gards can phyorie.
I took this picture on the north, the north of Britisland of British in the Inuit, and this man hundred alf with the Inuit, and he told me the wonderful story of his grandmother.
The government canades was not always as a gentle with the Inuit and the '50 to be in the '50 to be lit with colonies.
The grandmother, the grandmother, he refused to go on.
The family, I was in his life, and he took all the arms, and all of his arms, and all of his attres.
You have to know that Inuit doesn't have the freeze, they don't care the freeze.
The pattines in the origin died skin the origin in the horse of the hundred caries.
The grandmother, you don't do that man, you don't do that in the night of the arten or from the board to the nice that suffere.
It's sweet, you know, it's hot the skin skin skin skin the skin the hand. When the fect the focuses are congel, the working of a friend.
He sweetched the sketches on the dog, and when I did, I killed a dog.
He got a school and created a brillium, with the cassrops created a sland and has been shared a sland and it's disappeared on the banks, and it's shooting on the banks,
We want to talk about horse it with night? And then, in different way? And this, in different ways, and the resilience of the popular resilience of the popular popules of the popules of the world.
In 19999, the canades of the canades has reduced to Inuit to the Inuit the control of a larger of California and Texas the Texas the Texas the same together.
It's their new path. It's called Nunavut.
It's a territory independent. They are all the resources.
One of the national instances of how a national country to get with his popular popul.
And, finally, I think it's pretty obvious at least to who have been in these areas of the planet, remote that don't be remoted.
For someone is home.
They represents of the human imagination that are risaling at the albe. And for us all of these children, like the daughters, like the daughters, as the hope.
Finally, we National Geographic is we confidds, that politics will never get to nothing to nothing.
We think the polemy --
[Applausive -- they're not persuasive, but we believe that stories can change the world, and maybe we are the best institution, we have the best institutions of our website of our website of visite.
156 countries transmitted our television --
Our review from millions of people.
Our work is traveling in the ethnose of our public in the ages of wonders from which is going to be care of how they will go to the hope, hope, hope to be able to see the center of the anthropologists of anthropologist, and we have to find a style place in a place in a place in a place in the world of life in a place in a place in a place in a place in a pluralist,
which is the wisdom of all the popules can contribute to our well-being collective.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some things I wrote in this book that I hope to be in this book that you heard and provide and providing some collegments, in the case doesn't notice.
I want to start with what I call "the dog, the official."
The office dog, the office?
The dogm official society of all the Western industrial society -- "If we want to male the well-being of our citizing citizen to "The way to do it is to myself, "The way to myself."
The reason for the fact that the freedom is in the fact that the freedom is preciout, useful for human beings.
On the other is that if we are free, each of us can act to do everything that massive to do everything that male our well-being, without any of our well-name of our own well.
The way to male the way to myze the freedom choice.
More choices people doing, more are free, and most of them is free, and most of them is their freedom, it's their beings.
That, it's so deeply, it's so deeply that no one would dream of metter.
And it's also deeply in our lives.
I'll show you some examples of what the progress has recovered possible.
This is my supermarket. It's not particularly big them.
I allowed a simple named on the conditions.
In my supermarket are 175 conments, without containing 10 variety of oils became to the 12 acets of oil and 12 acets that you can buy for you a huge number of minds in the circumstances of the such circumstances in the circumstances of your degree.
Here's the supermarket.
And then you go to the snegotio to buy a stere: cassroom casses, CD, radio, the CD, radio, fairly printed --
And in this single snegotio of electronic components in this single set.
We can make six million and a half different combinations using the components that there are in a negotial.
You have to love that there's a lot of choice.
Other than the field: the world of communications.
One times, when I was a child, you could get all the phones phones wish phones that were provided by mamma Bell.
He wooked the phone, you didn't buy it.
One consequence of that, in the way, was that telephone doesn't rops the phone is not broken down.
These are gone to the time.
Now we have a variety of phones almost illitted cell phones in the cell phones.
Here's the future.
My favorite is the basic lector MP3, cutting the nase, and force in the crism.
If you don't have seen in the house negotic under the house, you're certain you who pretty much revery.
And what happens is the people who are people in the negozes in the negozes and do this question. And you know what the answ?
It's not possible to buy a cell phones that don't do too much of it.
So, in other aspects of life that are much more important than the waters, you will be the same explosion of choice.
Assistance, under healthy is not going to happen to the United States you to do.
Instead, you go to doctor, and the doctor says, "Okay, we could do A, or B" ""A, you know, "B" -- these are good-wells and these risks. What do you want to do you do?"
You know, "Doter, what would I do do?"
And the doctor says, "As these wells and these risks, and you have these risk."
"What do you want to do you to do?"
And you rebat, "Dottor if she was memeat?"
And the doctor, "I am not her."
The result we call it "the autonomy of malate," expression that makes it look like a beautiful thing.
But actually, it's not that one to move the weight and responsibility to take decisions from somebody knows who's the doctor, and almost certainly is not -- and almost certain is not in the ideal conditional conditional to take decision, which is not in the ideal conditional decision,
There's a marketing marketing products drugs, directly to people like me and you, if you think about you, whether you don't buy any sense, that we can't buy them.
But if we can't buy them, because do you public them do?
The answer is that they want you doctor to ask them to ask them to do the recise of change.
Something that is so fundamental issue is a choice, as you see in this view in this vividence is to force the children. We don't want to force the right moment of the right now.
And we can reinvention us how many times we again with it.
The means that every morning, you have to decide that you want to be a charge of person.
Rember the family and the marriage, a time prospective, a common prospective, and he was that you can get the pretty as possible, and begin to get the most pretty possible.
The only choice was choice was with th, and not go, and even that what do later.
Ogye, everything is really to play.
I mean, I think, very smart to be a lot of work in less than work in a time of work in a time.
And because they're not brilliant because they're not less diligent.
but why are I think, I mean, I mean I mean I mean I think, I should do that?"
"Do I have more tary? I have to think about the children or career?"
I'm interrogatives of logorant interrogative --
And they try to answer these questions, even if this imply doesn't completely completely not to completely get a vote to my example.
And they have to do that. They're really important questions.
Now, the work: we are lucky, like Carl teens that technology allows us to work every day, every day, every day, every day, from every day, from the Hotel Randolph.
Time of the parents, there's a corner and I'm not tell anybody where, where the Wies work.
Not saying, because I want to use it.
What does this incredible freedom that we have to work on the work, is that we have to decide, is that we have to decide, if we have to work or not.
We can go to see our boy hot with the cell phones in a tas, the Blackberry in the other, and the nine tebook, on the eye of the eye and needs the knee.
And even though they're all speaker, every minute that we see our child reflows us to be a type of the game?"
"I have to get to the hemail? I have to abbox,
And even when the answer is "us," all this makes experience the headads of your child very different from what would be in other conditions.
So, from any part of that, in the little bit of a big materials and big materials and care and life, life is a lot of life, life is a choice.
Once the world was this: Obe, there were some choice, but it was a choice.
The world today is this today is this is a positive thing to this: "Is it is a positive thing to the negative or negative negative now.
The answer is She's Shim.
The positive side of the negative sources of the negative negative negative --
All this choice is two negative effects on the people.
The first one, paralysis, paralysis is that produces instead of freedom.
And so many options that you chood, becomes very difficult to do it.
I want to give you an example of mean an instance, a conduction to the plans of volunteers.
A college had access to the data of the Vanks of Vancer, the gant society of thought, with about a million clients of thousand different clients in 2,000 different companies.
What she found is that for every 10 solutions that are are offered in every 10 solutions that are offered in the percent.
With 50 sources in less adesions in less adesions when they have been available to only 5. Why?
Because with 50 feet of the foundation of the choose is detailly difficult to decide and choice is remained to the indemitts.
And at the questions, and the questions, and of course questions, and of course won't get down.
You know, as it doesn't mean that these workers will be eat food for cans because they don't have enough money, because they don't have enough money, you also want to say that decision is so ostics that are so osticking the data of the data of the data of the data of the data of the data of the data of the data of the data of the data of the data
Not theipand they're losing until 50,000 dollars to the data from the dator work, which would be well in the data to arrun them.
So the paralysis is a consequence of having too much choice.
And I think that makes the world like this.
"And finally, for the eternity: "The echetchup, or majione?"
You would just take the decision of the right decision, if it's about ethnice, right?
You don't want to choose the wrong wrong and neps the wrong.
So this is the first effect. The second is that even if we can avoid the paralysis and do a choice, we have less to be as the result of how we will be with less of the options of the choices that chooks.
And this for different reasons.
One of these is that with a lot of conditional minds that you chood, if you buy a little bit of a different choice, is not easy to do a different choice. And what happens is that the alternative that happens is that the alternative imagined to the choice, and the reduce of choice, and the relimen of choice, and the relief of the choice, and the remachines of the choice, and the result of the choice,
even when it was a great decision.
More choices us that, more than anything details of any details that is unsumer than choice.
And then there's what economists call the opportunity.
Dan Gilbert asked a very well stamp as the value that we are the value of what we confronts.
And in the rest of the options that you can do is easy to represent the alteristic characteristic characteristics of the option that you have choice.
Here's an example. I suspect with all the ones that are not in New York.
But it's what you probably thinking about it.
There's this copy of Hamptons.
A place of laus.
Spipe day. Otyma day. It's all about them.
Nothing about man. But what he thinks is "Well, the males," is Austop --
"Everybody all my neighbors are alives."
"I could talk to home."
And it turns to two weeks away from the idea that is losing -- every day -- every day -- the chance of parking where you want.
The cost opportunity decrease of the satisfaction for what we have is, even when the choice was excellent.
And the more of the options we have to consider the characteristics will be returned out to be as a cooopportunity.
Here's another example.
This view says a lot of things.
It speak about the moment, and maybe of the living of live there.
But the most important point is that anything you choice, you choose you choose you to do anything else to do anything else to do anything else you choice.
The things that we don't choose are all four active that can make less attement what we do.
Tero point: growing spiral growing of the waiting.
I tried on my skin my skin a couple of jeans.
I was almost always jeans.
Once the jeans were just a type of a type from besty, they were uncomfortable to have a life and they had a lot of times, and they had a lot of times, beginning to go well.
So, I went to buy a new couple when the old ones were go, and I said, "I need a couple of jeans, this is my cuteans, this is my cut."
And the come, he said, "Li wants me to slim fit, easy fit?"
Would you like the cernier or with the bottonight? "Stones" or "act" or "act?
"Likes the road?"
"Sototbroken you want to get the blak -- "Bla -- -- "Continual to elense.
I was a little bor, and after a little bit of jeans, and I could say, "I want to do the kind of cheans, and I was so so for the hour, so I tried to all of the diseases of jeans, and then I was going to be able jeans, and the best jeans that I had ever been had.
It was the myself. With all that choice had the best.
But I heard me worse it.
Why? I wrote a book for understand it.
The reason I was worse for the whole choice is that choice was that choice were altish altish altish were altish to be perfected.
And I had expectations I didn't expected me -- I didn't expected with a type of the exist, at least a type of the type of them would be perfect.
What I had watched was good -- but not perfect.
After the choices that choicked with what I was looking for what I was insumed in confront of the way.
The add of options in the life of people don't forget the expectations that these are respectancy excellences.
And this will be less soddiscovered when the results are good ones.
Nobody in the world of marketing in the world of marketing it.
Because if you know that, you don't know what I'm talking about.
The truth is more like this.
"He was better when he was worse when he was worse when he was worse when you were worse when you were worse in the worse is that when you were worse in the sources that were even possible to meet the surprised of pleasant to meet the surprise.
Ogame, in the world where we live -- opulent, industrialized citizen with the expectancy -- the male that we can hope is that things are at the height.
You never will have ever surprised because your vostices are expectancy, you have ingiant ingiant ingiant ingiant --
The secret of happiness -- whose is -- "Baspectancy wait."
I mean, little time I mean, little moment -- that I am really wrong and my wife is really unstuff.
I could not do any better, I don't have any better, I don't have to be accounted.
But I don't always have a bad thing.
And finally, a consequence of the jeans of jeans when there's only that jeans is that when you're not satisface, and you ask you to say, "Why is you don't mean "Why?"
Who is responsible to here? "Who is clear.
The world is responsible responsible to us?
When you have hundreds of jeans, and you buy a little bit of a jeans, and ask you who is responsible to you who is responsible to you have to be there.
You could have a better better than I could do better.
With hundreds of variety of variety are not about the success.
So when people take decisions, even though the result is valized, you feel insods, and dam, and damage their own cola to their own own own chole.
In the last years the depression is exploded in the industrialized the industrialized world
I think a making factor, not the unique, but important -- not the unique, but important -- this depression of depression is that people have experiences because the standard are too high.
And when they have to explain this situation thinking that colate the colate is there.
So the final result is that in general we are better, objectively, but we feel worse about it.
Let me remind.
This is the official dog, what we all take for good and it's completely false. It's not true.
There is no twice that a little bit of choices is better than I haven't have a lot better than I haven't have a lot better than a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit better than than I haven't have a little bit of a little choice.
There's a critic, magic value. I don't know what it is.
But I'm sure enough we have been super-hundred of the level that choices our life.
Now, from the political point of view -- I have almost until view is the follow.
What allows you to all this choice in the industrial society is the material society is the material.
There are many places in the world, and you know about the world is not that have a lot of places that have no choice.
The problem is that they have too pocket.
So the fact that I'm talking about is a mal, being a disease to be exclusive society.
And what makes you depress and arrabing is this: Steve Levitt talked about about the hyesterday, and under seats are useful to matter myself. It's a spreky of money.
I mean, these choices, complicated and dispendous, it's not that they're just inuseful involved useful.
They are addirty deleteries.
They do do the worse of the worse of it.
If you have a little bit of what in our society allows it was reversed in those where people have too point, it would not just be their lives to be able to be able to be able to be not just their life.
This is what economists call a better paretian paretian paretian paretian paretian pareties.
One redistribution, it does good at all -- not just to poor poor poor -- because of this choice in the except that we go back to the top of the reds.
And he said, "Fole, you can become everything that you want to become everything that means --
You know, people of culture, "What do that weight is what does that fish the fish sket?"
"It's obvious that you can't get anything in a vetroo."
"As a fall, a limited vision of the world --
and I got the interpreted, at the beginning.
But then, I think, I realized that that fish the fish knows that fish the long time.
Because the reality of facts is that if you eeat franks, so that "everything is possible." You can't get the freedom. You get paralysis.
If you rope the mouse of a way that become possible to decluster the soddiscovered soddiscovered the sodden satisfaction.
You get the paralysis, and you reduce the well-being.
Everybody need a spher.
This is almost certainly too stretch, perhaps even for us.
But the absorts of symbolic symbolic infelicity for infelicity -- for the road road for the wine.
Thank you very much.
