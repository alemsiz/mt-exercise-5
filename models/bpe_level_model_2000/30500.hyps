The year I showed these slide to demonstrate that the glacial glacial glacial dimensions of 48 million years had had the 48 States of the 48 percent of the United States on the continent, is restreted.
But this is a lot of this subvality, because it doesn't show the character.
The artly glacial climbing is in a sense, the heart of global climate system.
You expands of inversus and the extracted.
The next next slides will be a rapid carlled on the last 25 years.
The icacus lost are drawed in red it.
As you see, you expanding to the blue to the blue screen.
That's the ice in winver, which is the outoutside of the summer in the wind,
You can see that the ice called the perenness, five years or more, is five or more, is like the blood --
In 25 years was spent like these.
This is a problem because the interested climate the icro-around the ocean art where there are huge amount of carbon that that we have enormous carbon that sheet that sheet that microbs.
Rispace to the totality of the atmospheric inquine, that amount of global warming -- that amount would be running this point of not return out.
In some of the laghi deeps in Alaska the metan handle is already reboiling from water.
The professored Katey Walter of University of Alaska has been recated with a team in the winver.
Video: Wow! All Gore: Wow! Something is if we are the question.
A reason is that this exchange is that this exchange in the Greenland and the Greenland from the north.
This is a glacial regime records.
The took never reached the similar levels.
This is the Kangerlusasuaar and the Greenland of the Greenland of the Greenland
If you want to know how the sks, you know, the level of the gactor, and where the sea.
These corrups are increasing rapidly.
An the other part of the planet: Antargest block of the planet.
The scientists have declared that the balance of the ice is in the negative ice, and that the Anrararctics, which is in the Western islands on some islands under in the sheet of the islands.
Here is quite a six meters of water, like in Greenland in Groenland in Groenland.
Himalaya, the third largest block of ice block of ice block in the laghi, who were seen years ago were icons.
40 percent of the world's population was receivable by the sheet.
One of Ande: this glacier is the foundation of the water of this city.
The doort-to-became up with the carried.
But when I decrease the same across the water at the potaste.
In California the Sierra Nevada is diminute.
The richs are in crisis.
The predictions, as you have a level, are graved.
The growing growing world door at an income to a remarkable increasingly autiful increasings.
The environmental disasters are increasing a returns out of the normally and without precedent.
Four times more numbers in the last 30 years of the last 30 years of the previous respects.
This is a remarkable of all unsustainable to it.
If you look at the context of the historical context if you can see the consequences.
In the last five years we added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the oceans every day.
Look at the East area of the oriental Pacific of America, to the west, and on the bottom of the continent in the continent of the continent in the oceans.
Most is global warming for global warming -- and it's the deforestation, which is the use of fossil fuels.
oil is a problem, and the carbon is a problem, and the charcoal is even worse.
The United States are one of the two of the more emissions, together to China.
And it proposed to build a lot of other carbon to build many other carbon to build a lot of other carbon to build a lot of other carbon to build a lot of other central central of carbon.
But we're assisting to a change.
These are the annulled projects in the last few years and some green proposes of green alternative projects
All the way there is a political lot.
The carbon industries and oil industries have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote the carbon and that is a oxymore.
And that image reminded me reminded me --
Natmal Natmama, where I live, there was a 3.8 billion gap billion gap carbon of carbon digits.
Maybe you saw it about news.
This is the second biggest flow of scories in America.
It's happened around Natmainly around Natma.
The natalian advertising of one of the carbon industries was this.
Video: Frosty the carbon is a basic and happy.
It's a detect here in America, and it makes our economy.
Frosty the carbon is increasingly cleaner.
It's just a good price, loyable, and the workers keep the sticpendent stick.
Al Gore: Dain here is a lot of the West Virginia.
The biggest society on the mountains is Massey Coal. This is his administrator.
Video: Don Blank: I will be clear -- Al Gore, Nancy Pelosis, Harry Reither, Harry Reither.
Al Gore: So the Alleance for the Clim of the Clim of Clim has a couple of the Clim of the Clim for the Clim for the Proteon the Proteon the Proteon the Proteon of Clim for the Clim of the Cli
This is a one of it.
Video: All right, and COALery look at the climate changes like a threats of the business.
So our priority is invest a great amount of money in a public effort to make public and confuses the truth on the charcoal.
In fact, the carbon is not spore.
We think it's pulled -- it also has a good fum.
So not pretty climate change.
Let me leave us.
Video: All right, Carble-clean -- you heard a lot of the
So let's take a game structure at the advance.
Straordinarily machines are a little noise, but this is the sound of the technology.
The carbon is between the main of global warming causes of global warming -- but the technology of carbon that you see changes everything.
Do you look at a charge odiernal technology.
Al Gore: Indeed, the positive alternative positive is connected to the economic security and to the national security of the national security.
Video: You're in crisi; America, the economy, the national security climate crisis, the national climate crisis.
The filter that colleagues all of the physical combustics -- the fossil fuels, like the carbon and the oil and the oil and the important.
Now, there's a new audition for the cirnice to us.
Repower America, 100, and 10 percent energy in decades,
They take America, to recover America, to make sure America, to make securred global warming global warming.
Finally, a solution that basts to solve our problems.
Like America. Scoprint more.
Al Gore: This is the ultim.
Video: It's about re-re-energy to America.
One of the fastest ways to take dependence from the combustics that kills that kills our planet.
All the future, the future. I just a new net.
She got 2: Nuoves investment for post-job jobs for post-job jobs.
All right, Repower America. It's time to be realists.
Al Gore: A old African proverbbs African flight says, "If you want to go to the money of them.
If you want to go away together."
We have to go away away, que.
Thank you very much.
The year last year TED fect in the LHC.
And I promise to go back to the car to get back to how the car.
So here I got it. And for those that the other time was not there was the largest scientific experiment never type -- 27 miles of miles of circumsters.
His a comfortable to receive the conditions that were present less than a million second of the universe -- until 600 million times a second.
And all of this is just environment.
This is the Gineva.
We photographs Big Bang Big in the relawers.
This is what I work. It's called ATLAS -- it's a 4meters and has a diameter of 22 meters and has a diameter of 22 meters.
This is an image spectacular image of ATLAS in building so you can see the proportions.
Ten settember the 10 years, we have accest the car for the first time.
And this picture was taken by ATLAS.
It was a because of immenses in the control.
It's an image of the first particle of particle that had done all the game of the LHC, entering collision, and deliberately, and spread particle within the LHC, and particle particle within the relaevator.
In other words, when we set that image the 10 settember the 10 settember words, that the machine, which is a great life.
I don't know if it was to do that exactly opping this when someone went on Google and saw that the paining beginning this was it.
That means that we had a cultural impact on the scientific impact.
About a week later, there was a problem with the machine, had to these files here -- these sleep.
These files are 13,000 prints when the machine works at the massive power.
Now, technical technical between you look at files, "It's not true. I'm films, "It's not true. I'm filter."
And they can do it because when they're very quickly cosidy become the sound of the superconvictors.
So, at least 271 degrees, at a inferior temperature in the space between the stars, these files can bring that corrup.
In one of the most of the magnets in the LHC, there was a defectly defection of fabrication.
So the files are surface that they read up to read and 13,000 ample prints suddenly met a resistance.
This was the result.
Now, this is even more impression, if you think that these magnets are 20 tons than 30 centimeters.
They are damaged about 50 magnets.
We had to take it to the half of it, what we did it.
We have them repristined.
They're now returning all the way to their place under below the ground.
And I went to the end of the LHC is going to be new integround.
We let it out, and we wait for us to get the data or him, and keep it or him, and keep so our adventure to discover what the universe.
Now, of course, in a certain amount of way, these accidents return the debate of science and engineering. It's easy to constate. It's easy to confuture.
I think that the fact that it's so difficult to go beyond the limits, I think that's the value of things like LHC.
I want to conclude with the words of a Inglesson, Humphrey Davy, where, in defense of inuseful experiments of inuseful experiments of his puple and was Michael Faray, said, "No is a dangerous for the human mind that is not a lot of human mind as a lot of human mind that are definitely realms that are not able to us, and in nature --
Thank you.
I want to start asking you to rethink about here, from children, by children, played the morning.
And while you realize them and reach them and reach them and resolving them and move them and resolving problems and resolving problems.
The reason is it deeply connected to the way we understand part of the world around us.
So, by informforming information by using the usal objects of physical objects, together my collaboratory and collaborator Jeevan Kalaniths, I started asked to ask myself, instead of of the mouse as we have a computer, instead of the mouse as a computer pastrelief that moves on a desktop, we can deal with both information with both of the hands,
and to it our please?
The question was so interesting that we decided we decided to explore the answer, building Siftable.
In a few words, a few Siftable computer is a big discover.
In a few words, a few Siftable computer is a big discover.
You can move them with the hand, they can see it in them, they can see their movement and have a wireless.
But more about physical objects, as the morning, you can just move on the morning, you can just relight.
Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem of tools for manipulate the information of digital information.
And as they become more physics, and as they were more physics, and as the others, and as they get more physics, and as they are consciously, and the other holds, as we can explore new and the different stiles and interactions of interaction.
I will start with some simple example.
This is Siftable is configured to show the video if you including it in a direction, if you can get it out of the other parts of the other parts of back.
These interactive records.
If they are relian, what they are going to be around them.
If they are circumstom, and they can agitate a little bit of a little bit of a but.
If they are circumstom, and they can agitate a little bit of a little bit of a but.
They also have their movement and inclination.
We then realized that one of the interesting of the interaction was the power to use the data, to example, "Deffort of the color, as if it was a liquid.
In this case, we have three Siftable configurated as secks of green and I can use them to use them to the color in the central central central where they mix the middle of the color.
and I can use them to use them to use them to the central color, where they misse.
If we can get too much of it, we can put a little bit about place.
There's also beautiful chance of learning as language, the mathematics and games of logical and logical things to try and see the results of things and see the results and seeing the results of immediately.
Now I'm going to --
This is a Fibonacus that I do with a program of equations.
We have a game of words that is half between Scarabeo and Boggle.
Sholished a letter to every turn on every Siftable, Pratically, to every turn Siftable, to every turn Siftable, and as you try to get parts of words about a dictionary, and the control words about a dictionary.
And then about 30 seconds remissing a new set of letting and new chance to try and new possibilities to try to prove and try.
Thank you.
Here's the children came to the Middle Lab, I did it so they tried them and I gave them a video.
They are lots of them are lot.
And one of the interesting things about this kind of application is that you don't have to give people many instructions.
You just have to say, "The Compons of words, and they know what to do.
Here's some other people who tried it.
This is our kids to the youngest beta young and right there.
It really wanted to get it just to the large them.
They just were a morning for him.
Now, this is an application of a interactive cards.
We wanted to build a tool for the apprentices of Lui is Felix.
It can inserve new characters in the scene, rewable the Siftable and associated.
It can inserve new characters in the scene, rewable the Siftable and associated.
And that's doing it out of the sun.
Video: The only is smild.
David Merrill: World was brought a treat in the scen.
Video: The arancient treat.
By work!
So schooling the Siftable and put it together can interact the characters --
Video: Bau!
-- by inventing their story.
Video: Cao!
DM: It's a story with open-open-up, and it can decide him.
DM: It's a story with open-open-up, and it can decide him.
Video: Vole, gact.
DM: The last example that I have time to show you is a tool, recently recently to sample, to sample, and to execk and music.
it's a instrument, recently recently, to sample and music.
Siftable here act here agiss like based and batteria.
Every one of these has four different variations, and you can choose what to use it.
You can get these sound sound in a sequence to be a sequence to your floor.
And modificate it simply to touch a sound "sound" and a sequenc."
These are effects that you can control live, as the reverse and too filter.
The attacks to a particular and then including it to add it.
And then there are the general effects like time and volumes, which is applicating in sequence.
Let's look at how it works.
Video: DM: We're going to start a base in two Sift, "sequence" -- we will start the extending in a series, we add the extend, we add the other basic basis.
Now put a low-up line.
Video: DM: World-to-of the percent --
Video: DM: And now I'll put the filter to the bacteria, so I can control the effect of live.
Video: DM: I can fast the entire sequencing the entire sequencing time from one side or the other.
Video: DM: And now I'll add the filter to give more expression.
Video: DM: I can recombine the sequence of the sequence.
So I don't have to planning it before, but I can try and make it longer or more corts.
And now, finally, I can get the entire sequencing the entire sequencing Siftable to the factor the Sift."
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is build new interface, new interface, more more and more look like our brain and more more look like our brain and body.
And today, I had time to show you one of the results of this peror, and some possibility that we try to bring out of the lab.
The concept that I want to transmit you is coming this new generation of objects to interact with the digital media that will be information in the way we want to do information in the way we want to it.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the now to talk to all of you.
I'm a write written to it.
Sorrange books is my professional but it's more than that, of course --
It's also the love and the fashine of my life.
And I don't expect that can change.
But I said, something particular happened in my life and my career in my life and my career and my career to recoaled me with this work.
And the particular thing is that I recently written this book, this biography called "Mangia, Prega, Ama," and my precedents for some reason -- and I became a big sensational sensational.
And the result is that everywhere that is now, people treatment me as if I was convicted to me as if I was convicted to me.
By -- convicted, convict!
They are now all worried and they said, "You have not been able to do anymore, "You have no more to do better?
You don't have you to keep writing for all life without any longer to be able to create a book that can be able book that can be able to someon?"
that can be important to someone can matter someone who can you matter someone can be matter to someone can matter someone can matter someone can matter someone can matter someone can matter someone can matter someone can matter someone can matter someon?"
It's sure it -- you know, you know.
But it could go worse and I remind, I remember 20 years ago, when I started to say to people -- I was an adolescent -- I was an adolescent -- I wanted to be a write of the trice.
I went to the same basic reaction by the paage.
And people said, "Don't be able to have success?
You don't have you fear that the humbitt you kill?
You don't have to do this mestive to do this mestive for all life without any of the life that you have ever drives with the shop button of the shock to love cate with the shock of falliment?"
You know, you know.
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is, "Si."
I fear of all those things.
I always had a paugh.
And I also have a lot of other things that people can't have to be ine.
As a and other things -- I mean.
But as I think about the writing what I thought and I was asked must ultimate it is why is?
Is it rational?
It's logical that everybody who has to wait to be saved by a job that feel feeling to do it.
But what is so particular about the inner creative to make us live to make us look at the mental health not doing doing it?
How my father, for example, he was a engineer and I don't remember one time in his 40 years of activity that was asked if he was asked if he had been going to be engineer to be engineer to be engineering capit?
There was never -- that block John, like John, how do you do that?
Don't worked, right?
Onestly, the chemical engineers don't have certainly in the century, in the secovered the reputation of being alcocohyaces.
We have enough this reputation, and not just writers -- not just writers but creative of every generous generation, we have this reputation of being enormously instable.
And it's not rest that look at the context of the magnitude of the magnitude of the magnitude of the creative dead and they are young and often for them.
And the ones that don't have suicide seem to be really disrupted.
Norman Mailer, before he did, in the last interview said, "Ogny my book, "Ogny my book.
But we don't have to be able when we heard about why we heard these things so we were completely interior in a completely interior and accepted the notion that creativity and the suffering is in some way and the artly, it will always be able to running to the anguy in the angods, it will always be a shot and the art is going to be able to get the anguy and the soft and it will always be able to get the notion that cre
And the question I want to take all of the today, is you agree with this ide?
It goes you go to this -- because it looks like a centimeter of me at the distance of me -- it doesn't good for anything this supposed to do anything that supposed to do about it.
I think it's hodiose.
And I think it's dangerous and I don't want to see the perpetuated in the next century.
I think it's better to encourage our great minds to live.
And I certainly know that in my case -- in my case -- would be very dangerous to become out to that I don't have to assummer the circumstances in my career.
Of course -- I was looking at the young -- I about 40 years.
I still have about four decades in me.
And it's very likely that anything that I would be write in the time will be right now that I was often, as the work that was happened in my last book.
I'm going to be a square of friends here -- it's probably probably the most success is my best success is my best one is to my shoul.
Oh, Gesus, who think!
You know this is the kind of though that brings a person to start drink nine and I don't want to do it.
I would just continue to do this work that we do.
So, the question becomes do?
And so I seeds, after many reflections, that the way to work to keep the way to do is to create a psychological construction of protective, ok?
I have to find a few way to find a security of me, that I'm writing, and my natural re's going to get out of the reaction that pocrituality is going to get out out of the year I started to look through the time, trying to find out more societies about how to do it if they could have any ideas to see if they could have the best ideas to see if they could have ideas to be able as write as write and how to do you can have the ideas and I write of the best ideas to do
about how helping people to deal with inherents of creative emotions.
And that research was brought to the ancient Greea and ancient Rome.
And I eguitems because it turns out the circle and then back.
In the ancient Grecia and ancient Rome -- people didn't think the creativity came from men, OK?
And it was thinking that creativity was this about divine and that came out of men and come to a few surface, and unknown for the distant distant and unknown and unknown to the distant and unknown it.
The grees called these bevins of creativity of creativity of creativity of the demons."
Socrate, wonderful of course, he believed to have a demon that elargiving wisdom.
The Romans were the same idea, but they were called the kind of spirit without a genius.
which is great because the Romans didn't really think that a genius was somebody particularly smart.
They believed that a genius was this kind of device, which was lived in the walls of the study of a artist, a little bit like Dobby, and that was out of the art's work. And he came out of the argument of the argument of that work.
Exctional -- et, that's the distance of the psychological struction that psychological struction that you protect you from your work.
And everyone knows that was so that he worked, right?
So the antic artists were protected by certain things, like the too narcism, right?
If your work was exceptional work was not going to take all the market, all knowledged that I was helped by this incorporate genius.
If your work is not the whole failure, it was not all your board, right?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be a inability to be a inability.
And so people have conceived the creativity in Occident for a long time.
And then the Rinachieved and all changed this great idea; we put the human being; we put the human being; we put the human beings and no longer and no longer to creatures and no longer creatures that write from divinity.
This was the principle of the rational experience and people started thinking that creativity came completely from the idu.
And for the first time in history, he began to referred this or that artist as a genius as a rather than a genius.
And I have to tell you, I think it was a big error.
I think allowed someone very simple person to believe that being like a foundation, and the source and the sistance of all my mysteries and the sisters of all my own mysteries and and ethernal responsibility to be a film or too big and ethese.
It's like to ask somebody to engineer the sun
Deform and history, completely the ego and creates all these expectations on the performance.
And I think it was this pressure to destroy the artists in the past 500 years.
And if that's true, and I think that the question becomes and now?
Can we do it different?
Maybe I think more ancient understanding more ancient than humans and mystery creative to the more and mystery to a more ancient understanding more ancient understand.
Or maybe no.
Maybe we can't cell in a rational thousands of rational thinking about 18 minutes.
And you probably have people between the audience that would be ready legitself to suspects on the notion that they follow people who follow foundation of their projects.
I probably not convince you all about this thing.
But the question I would like to take is -- why is it?
Why don't you think it in this way?
Because it has more sense than any other thing that has ever heard to explain the exxiety for the creative process.
A process that has ever tried to do something -- so basically that you have to do something -- so basically -- it doesn't have rationally rationally behavior.
And in fact, it can sometimes a paranormal paranormal seems completely paranormal
I did this meeting recently with the extraordinary poeter Ruth Stone, who has now 90 years, but it was a poet, and he said that during his own own childhood in the road Virginia, worked out in the road -- and I felt it out in the road -- when a poety came from the countrage.
He said that it was like a fragy fragot.
And that was rotating towards by the landscape.
You hear it turn, because he had to get the land under the ground underneath his feet.
He knew to have one thing to do to that point and he was go, and he was go, "Latch like a morn."
And so it was going to home and it was followed by this poety; it would have to make more that take a piece of paper and a quickly cool in the translate and and a bad mathem, and it would tell it and relito the page.
Other times he couldn't be quickly quickly, so correct and running and the running and the poetry rolled rolled through the rolled rolled through and she would continue through the lands and and it would continue through the lands and he would go through the land."
And then there were those times -- this piece never forget the time -- there were the moments that was almost losing lost, OK?
So, he was running at home and was looking for the cards, and the poetry was looking through the walked through the walked and he said, he was going to be in the walked and then he said, he was like if you get away with the other hand and the off.
And he was a poem from the coast from the coda and the purposes and the turn it on the page.
And in these cases, the poetry would be presented on the perfect page and intact the last word to the first before.
So when I felt -- it's exactly the way. It's exactly equal to my creative process.
I don't all my creative process -- I'm not a convict!
I'm a mule, and my way to work is to wake up with the same every day and soulder.
But even my head, my head, I slightly over against that thing,
And I image that many of you have the fact that many of you have the fact that I think that many of you can also have a lot of you have the face.
You know, even if the work and ideas and ideas and I would have a certain foundly knowledge.
And what is this thing?
And how can we read that in a way that we don't have to lose the head, but it makes us hands?
And for me about it was a best example of the contemporary that I have the musician I was Tom Waits, which I interviewed in a day.
We were talking about this, and you know, Tom, and you know, Tom, for the majority of life was the contemporary artist to control, and trying to control, and dominating these species of creative creative impulses of creative creative impulses.
But then he went on a day, and a day day and he was driving on a day and a day on the under autotion of Los Angeles, changed everything for him.
He was going to fast and a character, and all of a lodia, that was going to be in his head as the inspiration, elusive and elusive and athetics, you know, it's wonderful, and you know, it's won't how to take it.
It has no piece of paper -- it has no mathemates, it has no mathematic.
So it began to feel this kind of old old old old old old old that I said, "I'm going to lose and hossessionate by this song persemble.
I'm not quite good enough and I can't do it."
And instead of go to the panic path,
I'll go to the whole process and made something completely new process.
And he looked at the sky and said, "Scusa, you can't see I'm driving that I'm driving that I'm driving it?"
"You seem that can write a song once cancer once th?
If you really want to exist, I go back to a more opportunity when I can take care of you.
Other and important, I went to matter someone else today.
You go to disturbing Leonard Cohen."
And his process changed after that.
Not the work, the work was still dark as you seed.
But the process, and the fishing anks that was released when the genius, the genius, the genius that was out of the other problems and remain remain where it was realizing where he was happening, where he realized it was not a whole thing and I was going to be a whole thing and I went back to the genius that he was going to be a remarkable thing.
but well, this peculiar, wonderful bizarre conversation between Tom and this strange thing that was not Tom.
So I felt that story about changing a little bit of a lot of the way I was working and saved me a face.
This idea, saved me when I was writing "Mangia, Prega, Ama, and I was a little bit of the disperation where we are working on something and we don't have to be working on something and we don't have to think that will be a disaster books that will be a little bit of the worst of the disperse.
Not just bad the worst written book.
And I started thinking about design.
But then I reminded me of Tom who talked about the air and tries.
So I went to my face on the manufacturing and I would say my comments at a corner of the room.
And I told you then, "Yes, both the bottom, both the book, we know that if this book, it's not going to be brilliant not be brilliant, right?
Because as I see I am putting all that I haven't more about that.
So if you want to be better and you have to give you your party.
Okay. But if you don't do it, I don't have a quick free.
I'm going to write the same because it's my work.
And I would like to do that I am today that I showed me that I showed me to do my own the" because -- the end is -- OK, and it is the OK -- secopy in the deserts of the Africa, people were dances for dances and music and music and music to the albe.
And they were always magnific because the ballers were professional and they were fantastic and they were fantastic and they were fantast.
But every one of the time, it was a lot of these artists became across reality, and one of these artists became across reality.
And I know what you know about what's talk, because I know that the view everybody, a performance like that.
It was like the time stopping and the ballery walking through a kind of landscape and was not doing anything different from the solite, like 1,000 1,000 day, but everything was at the inevil.
And suddenly it doesn't just as a human being.
But you access, it turns out of the divinity of the divinity.
And when this happen, the people had been the them, the people knew what was called his name.
They had the hands and started to singing, "Ah, Doh, God, God, God, God, God, God, God."
That's God, you know.
He nuts the historical story -- when the Mororder, the South of Spain, they ran this habited in the centuries of "Ah, Allah, Allah, Allah, who's go," who's read in the sections or the float.
In Spay, when an artist made something impossible and magic artist -- and oh, oh, oh, oh, but, but, but, except -- a short of God.
And it's great because we need.
But the problem goes the day down, the dance, when you wake up and found that they are the 11 morning and the Martedday and the Dod is not more.
It's just a mortal with a death, and maybe it will never be able to get more to the higher to that altealth.
And maybe no one will be going to dog God even while and what do is it must do with the rest of his life?
It's hard to it.
This is one of the most dolorous reconciliations.
But maybe it doesn't have to be so anguy if you can not believe, in ort, the most extraordinary extraordinary as you are coming from you to yourself.
But it believed you from a ininstited by a inimaginable foundation of this squisite that you have to go to someone else when you finished.
And, you know, if we think about it changes.
And so I started thinking about it, and it's surely as I thought for several months during the work of the book, that I'm going to public book, the dangerous, the dangerous -- I was followed my great success.
And what I have to keep when I feel electric feeling -- not afraid of this is, not afraid.
Don't get the work.
He representing you to you give you the party, whatever can be.
If your work is ball, ball.
If the divine, you know, I would mean as you get a few kinds of wonderful things, for a only moment through your efforts through your efforts through your efforts -- "Ole!"
Other and you do the same dance.
And "Ole!" to yourself.
I think and I think I have to teach it.
"Ole!" at yourself, even for yourself, just for human and head, so that we have to do you represent.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
As you know I've talked about some of these projects on human genome, on what can meaning and the discovering of genes.
We're now starting a new furniture -- we started to begin to digitalizing biology and now we are entering a new phase, designing and synthesizing and synthesizing and synthesizing lives.
We always tried to take big questions.
"What is life is something that many biological biology have tried to understand various levels.
We tried to be different approach, reduced the minimes.
We're digitalizing by almost 20 years ago.
When we sequenced the human genome was going to go from the analogic world from the analogic world.
Now we ask us now to regenerate life, or create new life from this digital?
This is the map of a little organism, the Mycoplasma genome of the smallest genome of those that can self-replicated genome in the laboratory.
And we tried to reduce the genome to create a little bit more smaller.
We are able to eliminate a hundred genes of the around 500 that are here.
But when we look at the metabolic map of metabolics, it's relatively easy respect to the now.
You're just a simple of that.
But when we look at all the genes that we can elimind, one at the time, it's very unlikely that this can bring to a live.
So we decided that the only way to progress to progress to progress this chromosomes in a way to be able to modify some of these fundamental questions.
And so we started the winning of the "Do we can synthesize a chromoo?"
Can chemistry to do these big molecules that we never have to create these big molecules that we never have to create before?
And, in case of real-cromosound?
A chromosome, it's just a piece of chemical material of chemical material.
The speed with which we can digitalizing life is growing up to exponential life is growing at exponential range.
Our ability to write the genetic code, rather degrees rather slowly lying.
And our more recently results the results on a exponential curve.
We started more than 15 years ago.
The process has requirements a lot of the past, began with a biothic revision before the first experiments.
But we found that synthesize DNA is very difficult to be very difficult.
There are decades of thousands of cars in the world that are producing small segments of DNA, the longer of 30 to 50 to lecture and is a degenerative process: the most of the segment is longer and it's a long deal with them.
So we had to develop a new method to assembling these fragments and rors the middle and rorror the middle and correct the middle to assembling these fragments and correct the middle to assembling these fragments and correct the middle of the midddle and correct the
And this was our first trial information of the digital information of Phi X 174.
It's a little viruses that kills kills battery.
We designed the errors of the errors and had a location of DNA of about 5,000 letters.
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemical material of chemical material that we had began to read this genetic code and produce the genetic code particle and proviral particle and virals.
The virals are then released by cells, they went back to cells, they went back and have destroyed the Ellands.
I talked about recently recently with the oil industry that they certainly understanding that they certainly understanding this model.
They have more than you.
We believe that this is a situation where software can actually build the same hardware in a biological system.
But we wanted to do things more in big things.
We wanted to build the entire chromosome.
I'm 580 miles a lecture of genetic code genetic code.
So we thought about built it in the size of viruses, so we could change the size of viruses, so we could change what the components are a living cell.
The design is crucial information and if we start with digital information in a computer, these have to be very accurate to be very accurate.
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 the accuratezing standards, was a mibasis.
We found out of the original recently, 30 mistakes. If we used that sequence, we would never be able to do it work.
A part of the process is to designer segments that are overremarkable to recognize with all the other segments to build underlying subunit to build underunit to build underunty together.
We try elements to the only one here.
You probably read that we read about the philocation.
Think about four letter: We have a genetic code genetic code on four letter: A, C, GT.
Three of those lettes together codify about 20 adminoacid of letting for every lominous lecture for every love.
So we can use the genetic code to write words, thoughts.
What we did at the beginning was automome to the beginning was automomated.
Some have been deluses from the fact that it wasn't poe."
We designed these segments for powerful simply to unique them with the guys.
There are people, and there are people repaid them and put them and put them together.
And we started assembling the parts, starting with five to seven by five to seven milar segments of 24 miles an lectly lects, the lects, and it turns to get 72 miles a liters.
For every step, we produced these segments in abundance so that we can sequencing that we're trying to create a extremely robbbrobbbbrobbbrobbbitt -- as you'll see in a minute.
We're trying to automatize the process.
So this looks like the tabellon a basket.
When we get to these very longments, the more 100 mile of 100 miles the basic basic basis.
It turns to the limb tools of the modern biology.
So we considered other mechanisms.
We knew about another mechanism called "recombination of omology called "recombination of the DNA in biology to repair the DNA in the seats.
Here's an example.
This organism, called Deinococcus radiodurans, can be three million radioduring the radiation.
You can see in the soft of the soft as his chromosome.
In 12 -- 24 hours comes out of the exactly as it was before.
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do it.
These organisms can be set completely set completely away.
They can live under it.
I'm absolutely certain life exists in space, and you move to find new environments of water.
At to say the real reals, NASA showed that this avview.
This is an image of the molecules that we built using these processes, just by using these process.
The lievid them self-assembly of the automatically
This image was not taken with a electronic microscope, but with a microscope of rule.
It's a molecular molecules that we can see it with a microscope with a law.
These are photos that cover a period of about six seconds.
This is the audiences that we did a little time ago.
I'm 580,000 lettes of genetic code genetic code genetic code.
It's the biggest molecules that we have ever created by man.
It has a molecular weight on 300 million of the ones.
If we stamp it with a 10 caratter without spaces, it would take 142 pages only to turn this genetic code.
Now, how do we do it work? How can we activate it?
Of course, we tracked a virus.
It's a little bit more complicated when you use the bacteria.
It's just as simpler than it is cells as we treat cells as our eucarios as our nucleus and then you can just put another one one of the clon.
In the bacteria for the chromosome, is integrated in the cell phone, but we recently demonstrated that we can do a complete transplant that we can do a complete cromosome.
We can have a gamed cromosome, from a microbial species.
The two are different as men as men as the men are of the topis.
We added some genes in a more way to decide that I could decide what chromoom.
And it was a little bit of a way to kill all the proteins.
And when we put it in the cells was stuff -- and you will appreciate our softwo-sticato-to-cromosomes was gone in the cell.
And we started thinking we couldn't go over to beyond it, but we tried to go over there.
This is one of the most mechanisms of evolution.
We found that a lot of species have added a second or a third of a second or a third of a second hundreds of new trates of trath --
So who think about evolution as a only gene of the modific is not understood part of the biology.
There is of the restriction called "restriction of restriction is that they found DNA.
The chromosome, it was in the cell.
Mell phona-ha-hake cromosomes that we put it --
You expressed and recognized the other chromosome, and it was the mastick and we found it with only the cromodel.
It's became blue because of the genes that we had inserve.
And in a short of time, all the characteristics of a species are gone in a species, and it turned out to the new species, the new species, the software that we put in the cell.
All the proteins have changed, the membranes have changed, and when we read the genetic code genetic code of what we transfer to you.
Now, this might look like genetics, but altering the software DNA we can change things in the software enough sustical.
Now, I have explained that here is not about genesis -- but by three million years from three million years and a half years and a half of evolution, and I said that maybe we're doing a new version of Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosion of this digital process of degital process.
Why do that?
I think it's quite obvious when we think about our needs.
We're going to go from six billion and a half billion people in the next 40 years.
I am going to give an example, I was born in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for each one in 194, in 194, there are are going to be four.
We're going to find out at food now, fresh water and clean water and bags, medicinal and baggency for six billion people.
It will be more harder for nine billion.
We can get more than five billion carbon carbon of olies.
That means a day.
When we try to find biological processes, or whatever kinds of a process to repirate them, it will be a challenge of a huge challenge --
We have to keep the CO2 emission of all the CO2 emission of these materials that finishes in the atmosphere.
Al day, today, because of scientific discoveries in the world, we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I like to think that are designed for the future.
The electronic industry has only a dozen of the components, and think about how many different things came out of the different things came out of them.
Our limited here is principles by biological reality and our imagination.
Now we have now techniques, thanks to these synthesization, in graph of creating what we call genomics.
We can build a big robots that can produce a million chrobots that can produce a million chromosomes at the day.
Think about processing these 20 million different genes or trying to get to optimize the processing processing to produce eight gence, and vaccines, we can change it, we can change and make more biology and make more biology and create bigger biology --
And it's just a standard.
We can choose to choose survival of chemical providing chemistry or carbon and vaccines of vaccines --
This is an instantanee of some software programmed on which we're working for seats and designing species to sit species on the computer.
Well, we don't know necessarily as they will be no.
We know exactly how they are their genetic code.
Now we're focus on the focusing carbon of fourth generation.
You have seen you see ethanol from the grand was an experiment of the floor.
We have a second and third generation that will come up with enough sugar to sugar sugar to sugar carbon or or different kinds of butans.
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without more of the food and the coast of the food and the disease, it would be transforming the CO2 in the material that we're working in designing for cells that we are working for cells that we can reach this discover, and we think we could have a lot of four-months.
The solar light with CO2 is a methodom -- in our metodom -- in our discoveries in all the world, we found different metodis.
This is a organism that we described in 1996.
It lives in the ocean deep deep, about 2500 feet of the water.
It reates hydrogen, using hydrogen.
We're trying to understand if we can put CO2, that can easily be transported to be transported by major carbon to get that CO2 in carbon for carbon to drive this process.
So short we think we could be able to get what the basic question, "What is the basic issue is Now, truly -- we have the obic obic obic industry.
You're not going to do it from TED, where you can do that?
It would become a main a main source of energy.
And so, we're working for using the same metods to create vaccines to create vaccinistants.
You saw this year with influence, we're always back, we are always back, and a dollar in less when it's treating vaccine to find the right vaccine of the right --
I think that that you can change build vaccinable to change,
Here's how the future could begin to seem change, the evolution, the evolution, accelerating the evolution with synthetic bacteria and indeed, and infinally cells.
We're at so much more to improve people.
Our purpose is to do enough to try to do enough to try to do it. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
First of all I'll see the most rapidly possible, some fundamental work that we took Microsoft in followed to Microsoft in a year ago. This is Seadragon. This is Seadragon.
It's a environment that you can interact is a local level that remote with an enormous amount of visual data --
We're seeing a lot of gabyte photos of photos with a kind of zoom and continuous fast, we have to be able images as we want to do it.
And it doesn't matter how big amount of information that we see, how big these data or images.
Most is common photographs -- but this for example, this for example, is a scanning from the Bilibrary of Congress, and it comes into the 300 megame.
It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that limited the number of a system like this is the number of place in any moment. It's also an architecture in any moment.
This is a book, example, for example, of data not images.
This is the Dicken's Sholens. Every Casa desolved capitol.
To show you that it's just a text of the test and I don't image, we can do something like to see truly that it's a real representation of the representation of the textbook.
It could be a little bit of an artificial book.
You don't consider.
This is an example of the realistic. It's a number of The Guardian of the Guardian example of the Guardian example of the Guardian example of the Guardian example of the Guardian examp.
Every big image is the beginning of a section.
And it gives you really like the pleasure and the beauty of read truth, or a net of a view or a quotidness of a lot of half a very much best guy of a half a lot of half a lot of half a lot of a half of a lot of half a lot of half a quote.
We also did something with the corner of this number of the Guardian of the Guardian of the Guardian of the Guardian angle of this particular number of this particular number of the corner.
We created a high advertising high resolution -- much more higher than what you use in a normally advertising in the normal content -- and we had been served in the extra.
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile, you can see here.
Or other models, or even specific specific specific and techniques.
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limited space on the screen.
We hope that that means to put pop up and other parents, and other parents, not relief to be necessary.
Of course, the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology.
And I don't want to lose time, if we don't say that we have contributes to give it in this field.
These are all the streets in the U.S.
So now we go to something else.
This is actually actually actually living on the web; you can go to see.
It's a project called Photosynth, which combined two different technology.
One is Seadragon and the other is a very interesting research, a very interesting research, a student of Washington, with the Hever, with the Heve Steve Steve Seitz of Washington, and Rick Szeliski Resear. Seliski Resear. Seadagain and the U.K. . All rill.
And it's from Seadragonon.
You can see it when we do this kind of screen that we can go from one image to the other and have this kind of experience to multiply resolution to multiple.
But the space of the images here has actually an equipment of the images here has a meaning.
The computer algorithms of visualization of the computer recorded these images together, so that the real imagine, in the real imagine. All the real skin the Grashes on the Montags -- have been taken on the Montagages of a slides of a slides of a slides of space.
I don't know if I have time to show you some other environment.
There are some more space than there are a lot more space.
I want to go directly to one of the original data from a precedent of Noah-- and this is from a precedent prototynthesize that we have done for the first time -- to show you what I think is really the key to show you what I think is really the key is really quite the technology, Photosynth. And it's not necessaround. And it's not so much as evidence.
We had to worry about legal ways. And I saw it.
This is a reconstruction of Notre Dunch images Flickr. Basta digital reconnection in Flickr. And you get images in Flickr. and you get images of the types of the physical image that it's appears to this model is an image that it's appears to this model of it.
So they're all pictures from Flickr and were all colleged in space in this way.
And it's possible to navigate in this simple.
You know, I would never have thought about to work for Microsoft.
It's very gratify to receive this kind of accopy.
I think you can see that it's a lot of different kinds of fun fun of different phones of focuses to those cells at the professional sensition of SLR, a significant number of meaning in this environment.
And if you can try to look for those strangers.
Many are blocked out of down, etc.
Something here is a series of photographs -- etcol.
This is a poster of Notre Dunk Dunk correctly in the record.
We can go from poster poster from the poster physics of this environment.
The essential point is that we can do things with the social environment. This is now taking from the entire memory of how to appearing the Earth, and it turns out all those data together.
All of those photos become together, more than the sum of the parts.
You've got a model of the entire that emerge.
Think about this as the Stephen Lawler work on the virtual Earth
It's something that grows in complexity as people using the people usually usually as the vantages for who use the use.
Their photos are marched by other people.
If you get the idea of contransfitting all these lots of these things says the name of Notre Dame improven suddenly requirements of all those data, and I can use the data, and I can use the way of emmers in the space, in that universe, in that universe, in that universe, in that universe, using the photos of the space and have a social experience of the kind of cross-users.
Of course, a consequence of all this is extremely elaborated virtual models of every interesting part of the ground, and the images and satellitarian and similar planes and similar memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I realized what your software will be going to be able to do is that at some point, in the next few years old, all the photographs shared by everybody in the world will be practically college with whoever be practice together?
BA: Yeah. Yeah. What's doing it is doing it is to discovered.
It's creating hyperlins, if you want to hyperline, between images.
And it's doing it in the base of the images.
And it becomes very interesting if you think about the recharge of information that many of these images can education that many of these images can education.
As when you make a research of images on the web, and the head on the web has a lot of information about the pictures of the photos.
Now, what if that picture is collected to all your picture?
So the amount of interconnection and the amount of interconnection and the amount of realm that is really huge reted.
CA: Blaise, it's really amazing.
BA: Thank you very much.
One of the main the main when you travels travels and the etho's research is the power between who has no anti-forgoes in the wind, the reality of the tradition, the touch of the place that in the wind, the touch of the plants.
Basti thinking that sciamans Jaguar is still beyond the Way, or that the myths of the ancient Inuit of meaningful meetings, or that in Himalaya, to remember, to remember, to remember, to remember, to remember, and the idea that we are not sense.
the consequence of a particular choices that our stirps that our stirps of the adaptops of the falls.
And of course, all of essential trately.
We all born it. We all procreate it.
We are subjected to begin to return out out of the initiation.
We have to deal with the inexorability of death, so it doesn't surprised us and whales --
all of us have an art.
What it holds is the realm of the song of every culture.
It doesn't matter matter to the Borneo, or the Borneo, or the Haiti, or the Haiti, or the Worriers of Kair in Kenya section, the Cander's Cander's Cander's Candleveling in the heart of Sahara.
He was my viewed my view of journey in the desert of yak in the walls of the II, the mother of the Everest, the mother of the world.
All these populations teaches us that there are other ways to think about other ways to think about other ways to think about other ways to think about the world.
And if you get a minute, it's a concept that can give you hope.
And I think the cultures of cultures of the world create a ragnatela and cultural and cultural to be so important for the benefit as the planet and it's important for the benefit as biosphers.
And you can think about this rather cultural ragnate; you can think about an ethnos; you can define the ethnos; the total amount of all the conceptions, inspirations, intuitions -- intuitions -- intuitions -- and intuitions from the consciousness.
The ethnose is the fantastic patrimonurimonum of humanity.
It's the symbol of what we are and what we can be in as inquisite species.
And because the biosphere was free freezed as it was fat the ethoximate was very quickly.
No biology, for example, it would say 50 percent of all the species was or on the extinction of the extinction of the biological diversity -- in the most apocality, and the biological diversity -- and not near the pocket, and it doesn't even near the most optimistic diversity -- that diversity diversity cultural diversity.
The indication of all is that the language, the language.
When you were born there were 6,000 languages on this planet.
One is not just a language of a vocal or a series of rules or a series of rules rules or a series of rules.
One is the language.
It's the middle with which animals of every culture comes in the material.
Every lingua forest of the ment, a wine, a penguy, a thought, a thought, a thought?
And those 6,000 languages in Monterey, at least half the half is not sushalf in the ears of children.
They don't have teached to children, which means not something that they don't get something like something -- that are already dead.
What is more than being fly in the silence, to be the last one of the last to be the last one language, not to transmit the wisdom or ananticipate the wisdom or ananticipate the promise of the children?
This is a few weeks, it was somewhere in the world every two weeks: every two weeks a bag and door and door and door and it door and it door in the ulsillabes of a anguguguguguy.
And I know somebody of you will tell "Is it not better like this?
The world would not be a better place, if we talk about the same language?" Benyond, then we talk all slight?
We talk to kogi.
You'll be able to be able to talk about it not to talk about your language.
I would like to do you take you a journey through the ethnows --
a little journey in the ethnose of what we're losing is that we're loging.
Many of us forget that when I say "different different ways of existers" existers" -- I really mean to exist.
Let's take for example, this bimbo in Amazon in the settrial Setter's population of the anacrist, which creates to come from the rivers of the bagger's bread of the sidewest sacrids.
It's a popular popular that is not able to distinguished the blue because the time is horest because the time of the forest, which is identified in the forest of the forest because the popular popule.
They have a strange and a language, and a mathemates "Lesogamy of language, "You have to get a different language.
And all of this has radicated in the mythological past, all the way of the extra family is that in these family expensive or seven languages are talking about six or mystands a language.
They listen to listen and then start talking about.
Let's take one of the most interesting tribes that I lived in the Waorans of Ecuador in 1958.
In 1957, five missionar of a committed connecting a rest of a fact that a fact that was a fact that they had a fact.
They have done by the high photographs that were returned into poors that were returned into the plugments of the plugly forest of the plugly forest of the plug-dimensional forest of the size of the size of the bi-dimensional forest.
They have a holding phphotos from the ground, they have a form or a shape or a figured, they have been concluded that it was the diavole, and they killed the five of the billers.
But the Waoran isn't just killed the strangers.
They kneeds to be killed with them.
Five percent of mortality was because of their mortality was because of their mortality was about their own own stand.
We are risalitites to eight generations and we found two natural death cases of knowledged that one of them was insisted that one of them was dead, and then they killed it was a little bit of a bad of the same. All the same.
The cactors were able to recognize the animals from 40 and recognize the species.
In the early '80s, I was assigned a really interesting comfortable when my professor of Harvard was asked me if I wanted to go to Haititi in the intrupholars of Duvarier societies and Tonton Macoutes, and I could use sugained from Duvelse and Tonton Macoutes, and I can make the zombies.
To give a sense to the miracle Vodouble, I should have the Vodoun culture Vodoun and the Voodoor is not nera.
It's just a kind of a metaphysics of a metaphasic vision.
Very interesting.
If I asked you to tell me the big religions, what would you say?
Cristianesim, Buddddhistory.
A continent is always left out of the sub-Saharan Africa, is not feather. And instead is not religious and the Voodoo doo is not that the distill. And the Voodoo deeps a very deep deeping of the deep-deeping of the slavery of the slavery of the slavery.
What makes you interesting your voodoo is the intense between life and death.
So the live spirits.
You can be invocated by the Great As Grande Aca, respond to the dance of the dance and they replace to the animals in a way that for a short of the way that for a short becomes the dio.
So your voodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodooes.
We go to the temple, and we become God."
And by the moment that you're having the spirit that you drives you, how can you drive the male?
So it looks like these incredible events of these incredible events. So I follow the trances that touch a demonstration of the power of the power of the power of the power of the mind when it was catalyzed in a state of exectreme.
And all the popular popules with the most extraordinary I lived the most amazing Kogi World World World World World Colombia --
It's a foot that you were going to cyran, which was living on the floor of Colombia in the country in the conquery, the population of the conquery that the vulcanic plankurs.
In a blood blood of blood -- this popular popular has never been conquered by the spagnos.
At the today is a classily.
The young follows are behaviors to three or four years and they live in a world of good and they live in a world of good and bombs in the basic for 18 years of the icons for 18 years on the icons.
Two nine years of choices choices to reproduce the nine months of the gestation that spent in the user of the mother, now I'm metaphorically.
For all this time, they come acculated with the values of their society, that they predict their prayer and their prayer and only their prayer -- or to say the balance -- or to say the balance -- or to say the balance balance -- or to say the balance balance --
Al terms of this incredible beginning, they suddenly brought out and for the first time in life in the age of 18 years, they see an albe. And in that active awareness of the first bad asic bys of the first bad of the beautiful best -- all of his vallor, everything that have learned in the theory is conferred and say,
"Do you had, how I said,
It's just stuff out. Now it's going to protect it."
They call the most and they say that we have, brothers that we, brothers are the holds of the world.
This level of intuition is extremely important.
When we think about Indigens and the environment, we think Rousau and the old story of the wildnble story of the wildness or maybe we look at the rockets in his simplicity or maybe we say these popules are closer to the Earth of us.
The Indian popular popules are not feeling of the none of our algia.
There is not space for these things in the malaric malaric in the Asheet, but because of the Tibet, but because of the Tibet, they created a mystic, and created a mystic, but on a basic concept that the Earth is a little bit of a beautiful consciously need: it can live because it's infuses only infuses from human consciousness --
What does it me?
And that means that a And, that grows growing that the mountain is a spirit of Apu that will be a destiny of Apu that will be a deeply and will be a very different reported and a lot of fundamental respect with the mountain a well-like fun of Montana beautiful caves of Montana bag of rocket.
which is the dimore, a mineral or a mineral was irrilevant.
What is interesting is the metaphor that defines the report between individual and natural world.
I grew up in the forests of the British creating that the forests serves service to be cut.
What he realized me to be different from my friends Kwakul that created the Hukuk and the history of Hukuk and the history of the paradisease, and the history of the world, spirits that live in the world, spirits that are in the Hamatse.
If you start to look at that these cultures can create different reality, you can start understanding some sensations. We take this plant. We take this plant.
I took this picture to open the normal Amazon the normal Amazon the norm.
Maybe some of you have heard about ayahuas, the most powerful repertor of the slide of the sciamanic repertor of the sciamanic repertor of the sciamanic repertor of the sciamanic repertor of the slightly psychoace.
What makes it fascinating the ayaxis not the potential to the phase, but his elaboration. It's compon from two elements.
On one hand, this lian board lian ba-carbon of beta-carbon and harmine and harine, list and hardly hallucinogen.
To take the only plant is a blue sky that alters a little bit of the consciousness of the coffee with the fall of a family of the coffee of the coffee called Psychosters.
This plant powerful contident powerful for the servotonine, dimethod: 5, methoxoydimethoxoydimethoxoydimethoxoydimethoxoydimethods.
If you will see Yanomami Yanomami to the nose the sustance that are fun from different set of species, "anche'd see methoxoydimethoxoydimethoxylyltry" --
To be that to be a little bit like being spared by a little bit like being sparated by a smoke and land and on a mate of charges and land on a distortion. Don't creates a distortion. It creates a destory; creates the dissolution of realit; it creates of reality; it creates the dissolution of the reality; it creates of barocks and to land and to land to late that the despspringed destory."
I was often a professor, Richard Evan Shultes, the man who flew the man who fed the psychedelic, with his discovering fundaments in the '30s in the '30s in the '30s in the '30s in the '30s in the '30s in the '30s in the 1930s in the '30s in the 1930s in the 1930s,
Second my tesses you can't let these triptamines like hallucinogens because if you're not done to be able to tell anybody to be able to be about. I lost can't be any hallucine. I lost can't be source because they're monoxious because they are monoxious in the extinct, as a nice extinct, as a methespecially as a myself as a well.
And you can see the MAO.
Now it's the beautiful beta-carbins that are in this lian inbitors of MAO, the same kind of necessary to potentiate triamine. The question to potentiate trial: in a floor. The question of 80,000 species of plants, like these popules of popules that are a very biochemistry that is that it's such a biochemical version of the particular things?
We use the great euphemism of proof of and the middle and that can be revealed to be revealed with it.
But if we ask Indians, they will tell us "The plants speak about it."
What does it me?
This tribe, the Cofan, 17 variety of ayaas, which they were born in the forest and that we were born in the forest and our eyes would come in the same species.
If you ask them how they are stablish their tassonomy to tell us how they are going to tell plants, the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of plants, and I said, "I think about the plants,
The solution is taking 17 variety in a night of the side of the side and each other.
With this is not Harvard, but it's much more interesting than to count the stames.
Now, the applausize, the problem is that the ones of us who are heart the people who are pitches and in the history of the history of the history of the real-history in the world and over to the world in the realitter.
In fact, the XXXXX-year-old and reminded for the wars or the war or innovation or innovation technological innovation and we have been haboted and we have been in the haboted and we have been actively or accepted the destruction of biological diversity and cultural diversity and cultural digards.
All cultures through the century have been involved in a dance of life.
And the problem is not technology.
Indians Sioux Indians don't stop being Sioux when they put part and freck and freck people have no side of Americans have no side of the hororses and calmess.
It's not the change or the technology that they threat the integrity of ethnose.
The fly hard of domination.
And if you give you a look at the world, you will discover that these are not cultures that are not destined to disappear.
They're living creatures out of the existence of identifiable forces out of identifly in their ability to adaptations.
And I think it's disboxing in the patria of the God's patria of the guy that --
a popular population in Sarawak, in the so-asian popular population that lived in the forest forest to a generation ago, and now reduced to the server service and prostitution, where you can see the river, where you can see the rivers the rivers of the book-like half Borneo in the Merspringing of the horizontans in the Earth,
you know, to stick the stick with the undertract to the forest forest.
Or in the case of the Yanomers, are the diseases that come with the horse of the hore.
If we move on the mountains of Tibet, where I'm doing a lot of research that the face of the political domination.
As you know the genocide of a popular popular -- it's convicted to universal level -- but the equal equal of the life style of a popular popular environment, not only is not just convicted in the environment, because it makes part of the developing of developing engineering of developing world.
And you can't understand the suffering of Tibet until you start not part of the beginning.
I have spent 6,000 miles away from Chinina in the Western China in the Western Cina with a young young Tibet with a young colleague, but only came to Lhasa I realized the statistics.
6,000 world's sacred monuments in poles and cenergy.
1.2 million people killed by military Rvolution.
The father of this guy was ascritited to Panchen Lama.
which means that it means that was killed to the Chinese invasion of Chinese invasion --

The Tibet of Tibet can be insurvey but the rest of the population is from tener to keep the popular --
At the end of the falls and a choice.
We want to live in the world, the world, or we want to get the policyromatical world of different?
The big anthropologist, before he died that his most largest country was that in our world, in our vision was that in our world, we don't just see the whole gam, we will not just see the whole gamm of human imagination of the human imagination of the human imagination of thinking about it, but a day we can see it as we were other people, even even thought.
And it's huming that our species is existed for 600,000 years of it.
The Neolith Rvolution, who given us the agriculture, that has done us to the cult of the seeds, replace the poem with the slide of the slide of the specialization, and we talk about 10,000 years ago.
The modern world industrialized has 300 years old.
That slide story doesn't suggests that we have the answers to all the challenges that we have to come to the millennive.
When these myridge of cultures of what it wants to say to be humans, respond with 10,000 voices.
And it's in these answers that we all responsible riscover, we have a consciousness of being what we need to do with all the popules and all the popules and all the gardens can true. And there are big moments.
I took this picture on the north of the Build's island when I went to the whales of the Inuity, and this man man was bales with the Inuity, Olaya, he told me the wonderful story of his grandfather.
The government canades was not always always as the people, and the '50s, and in the '50s to stabilit our sound in colonies.
The grandfather of this man came up with the grandfather.
The family, temple for his life, and he took all the arms, and all his rects.
You have to know that Inuit doesn't have the freed, the sprinkers.
The packs, the horgin origin in the origin in skin floor.
The grandfather of this man doesn't make intimiddle of the night or the arty of the arty or from the lizartly broket.
It's a skyolated village, hot the skin the focuses and defected in the hand. When the fect folks are congeled, the creating lam.

We want to talk about horset with nothing? And this, in different way? And this, in different ways, and in different ways, and the symbol. And this is the symbols of the popular resilience.
In the open-1999, the canades of the California total land-a-territory of a territory and Texmyth.
It's their new path. It's called Nunavut.
It's a territory of independent territory. They have all resources.
One of the example of how a nation-state country that was a nation-in-popular nations.
And finally, I think it's quite obvious at least at least at least the ones of the planet, realized that they don't realized that they don't remote remote remote remote that they don't remove remote that they don't remove to the planet, I think of it is going to be in the remote areas.

They represent sections of human imagination that they risaling at the high of the hope. And for us all the skin the nearly geography become part of the new geography.
For finally, we were convinced to the political is that political political is that the political political will never get anything.
We believe that the polemy --

Our rements are literally ready to millions of people.
Our work is to travel in the ethnose to bring our public in places of cultural places that are going to go on the way they are going to be view in the central location of anthropologist, and we have to find a place in different diversity, and we have to find a multural world in different world.
in which the wisdom of all the popular wisdom can contribute to our well.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some of the things I wrote in this book that I hope to recall other than you heard and proverse to the collection of collegments, in the case doesn't have notaste.
I want to start with what I call "the officale."
Can offical dogm of what?
The official official society of all the Western society of the Western society is "If we want to massimize the well-being of our citizen."
The reason for the side, in the fact that freedom is in the fact that freedom is preciout, essential for human beings.
On the other is that if we are free, each of us can act for just connecting to do anything that massive our well-being, without any of our well-being, without no one that decided in our name.
The way to massimize freedom is to male freedom is to myself.
More choices people hanan, more free, and most of the freedom is their freedom, and it's their belty,
This is so deeply, it's so deeply radicated in society that nobody would be able to put it in the audience.
And it's also deeply ranged in our lives.
I'll show you some examples of what the progress has possible.
This is my supermarket. It's not particularly big --
I allowed a simple named on the condition.
In my supermarket there are 175 conditions, without containing 10 varieties of oil and 12 athese, and the 12 balsamic and 12 bams that you can do a huge number of conditions, that no one of the 175 already already already already is your degree of your degree and the 12 already already to be your degreat.
Here's the supermarket.
And then you go to the electronic snow, the charge, the CD, B, the CD, the CD, radio, please.
And in this single negotial of electronic components of the electrons of the electrons.
We can do six million different and a half of different combination using the components that there are in one negotie.
You have to admit that there is a lot of choice.
Other than the communications.
One times, when I was a child, you could get all the services cleaning phone wish phone that were forned by mamma Bell.
He was nowooden the phone, you didn't buy it.
A consequence of that, in the other one one was that the phone doesn't stop move up.
These day.
Now we have a variety of phones, especially between cells.
Here's the future.
My favorite is the middle in the middle of the hidden and the hort for the crashythmyself.
If you have no yet you've seen in the case, you're going to be well as a lot of reality.
And what the end happens is that people entering in the negozes and it does this question. And you know what the answer?
It's not possible to buy a cell phones that don't do too many things.
So in other aspects of life that are much more important than waters, it is the same explosion of choices.
Assistance, not happening in the United States that you go from doctor and the doctor and the doctor of what you have to do.
Instead, you go to the doctor, and the doctor says, "Okay, we could do A, or B" and these risk" "B" has these benefits." What do you want to do?"
You know, "Dr, what would I do about that?"
And the doctor says, "As these goods and these risks, and Bs these risk."
"What do you want to do that?"
And you rebat it, "Dr. If she was me, what to do you do?"
And the doctor: "But I am not le."
And we call it the ""the autonomy of malato," expression that makes it seems a beautiful thing.
But actually, it's not a shift and responsibility to take the decisions to take decisions from somebody who knows somebody else that you don't know -- and almost certainly is not -- and so it's not a good ideal conditional to take decision, and so doesn't have to be a patient.
There is a huge marketing products pharmaceutical products to people like me and you, if you think about it has no sense that we can't buy any sense, that we can't buy them.
But if we can't buy it, because there is a publishing?
The answer is that they want to doctor, we call the doctor.
Some of so fundamental as our identity is a choice, as you see in this view of the sky, "We don't want to force the children. We don't want to force the right moment of the right right now, we have to invent a hyd: we have to invent a hyd:
And we can reinventing us how many times you ago.
which means that every morning that every morning, you have to decide that kind of person.
Rispace to the family and the marriage, a common perspective, uncontact almost for everybody was that you could get the most pretty possible, and it started to make the most pretty possible.
The only real choice was with choice was with choice -- not the one what to do later.
Ogam, everything is really to play.
I teach them very smart students, and I think about 20 percent of work in less of work respect to a time.
And because they're not less brilliant, because they're not less diligent.
but why are they impensiers, I mean to ask yourself or no? I should be able to do it?"
"Do I have to get more tard? I have to think about before the children or career?"
They're interrogative.
And they try to answer these questions, even if this implements not completely to the compitions that are and not getting a little bit of your exam.
And they have to do it. I'm really important questions.
Now, the work: we're lucky, like Carl Warl technology that allows us to work every day, every day, from every day, every day, from every day, from the Hotel Randolph.
To parentess, there's a corner, and I'll not tell anybody where, where the Wii works.
You don't say that I want to use it:
What does that mean, this incredible freedom of choices that we have to continually decided, we have to decide or not.
We can go to see our child play hot with the cell phone in the tas, the Blackberry in the other, and the news and the news were.
And even though they're all spent, every minute that we see our child to swin the part, we are also asking this call?"
"I have to answer this email? I got to hable?"
And even when the answer is "no," all this makes the experience of your child part, very different than the other conditions.
So, from any part of any part of it, little things and big stuf, things and life is a choices and life, life is a choice.
Once the world was this: Obe, there were some choices. But not a choice.
The world today, is like this: The dilemma is, "Is it is a positive, or negative negatives?"
The answer is Shyds.
The positive side of the negative we know about the negative negative --
This choice is two negative effectly negative effects.
The first one, paradoxment, is that produces paralysis that freezed free.
And many options of the options that choose, it becomes very difficult to do it.
I want to give you an example of mean an an instance, a study of volunteers.
A colleague has access to the Vancertain the Vancer, the company of though, with about a million clients of thousand companies.
What she found was that for every 10 solutions that are offered in every 10 solutions that are offered in the floor of the floor.
With 50 fundaments, there's 10 percent less of less adesions when they have available only 5. Why?
Because with 50 foundation of the foundly hard to decide -- and the choice is to remained the inomers.
And at questions, and asking questions, and of course, questions, and of course questions not there.
You know, you don't just mean that these workers will be making food for cancers because they don't have enough money, it means that the decision is so ostic that decision is so ostics that the decision is that they lost the fundamental foundation of work.
Don't participand, they're losing until the data of work, that would be well willing to the data, that would be a lot of to the them.
So the paralysis is a consequence of having too many choices.
And I think it makes the world like this.
"And to finally, for ethis: ketchop or major maion?"
You would take the right decision is to take the right decision if it's for ethese, right?
You don't want to choose the bad source, and the wrong the wrong condition of the wrong.
So this is the first effect. The second is that even if we can avoid paralysis, and we do a choice, the least we are going to be the result of how we would be stately with less options that we would be stately with less options in the way the choose.
And this for different reasons.
One of these is that with many conditions with the floor of the choose, and it's not perfect and it's not perfect that you could have a different choice. And that what happens was better than it would be better away. And that alternative imagined it induces the choice, and the choices of choice, and the receive recognized by the decision that you could have a sense of the reality,
even when it was an optim decision.
More choices us -- more than anyone detail of any detail that it's insure that it's insure that it's insure that it is insumption of choice.
And young economists called opportunity.
Dan Gilbert asked, very well stamp as the value that we go on the value that we dependent things we compared out.
On the rest of the options, it's easy to represent the alteristics of alternative characteristics of the options that you have choice.
Here's an example. I just use with all the ones that are not New York.
But it's what probably probably thought.
There is this copy to Hamptons.
A place of lusse.
It is the splendy. It's all about it. It's all for them.
Nothing eat anything. But what he thinks is, "Well, males" is August."
"Everybody all my neighbors in Manhattan are vie."
"I could talk about my front of the front of thes."
And it turns two weeks away from the idea that is losing -- every day -- the possibility of parking where it wants to parking where it wants.
The cost opportunity of opportunity decreation for what we have, even when the choice was excellent.
And the more is the options that we have to consider, the more remarkable to return us out of how cost to cost as a cost of opportunity.
Here's another example.
This views a lot of things.
We have to live the moment, and perhaps living slow.
But the most important point is that whatever you choices you choices to be choices to not do the other.
The things that we don't choose have a lot of four that can make less atter what we do.
Ter: I was a spiral growing waiting.
I tried to my skin my bought a new jeans.
Almost jeans.
Once the jeans were a type, they were a bestive and were bestive and were bying, they were brought a life and worked a lot of a by-bucks, began to go good.
So I went to buy a new couple when the old ones were go, and said, "I need a couple of jeans, this is my cute."
I said, "See you want to slim phite, asy found?"
Would you like it takes it or the bottons of bottons? "The Stonby?
"Would it it takes them road?"
"Soth eight of the bage or stretty? Bla blahold? Bla blades.
I was running and after a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the guy -- that was the only guy -- that he was the only guy -- that I was the only guy that I tried to all the same ewise, and then I went out of the negotie, and I was the best jeans that I had ever been doing.
It was the myself. With all that choice had the best best.
But I felt like that.
Why? I wrote a book about it.
The reason I was worst the worst one is that with all the choice was that with all the middle was altish and the jeans had to be perfects.
I had wait for a minimes. I didn't wait for exceptional about when it only was a guy that was only a guy that was 100 different than 100 different guys, at least a guy had to be perfect.
What I had watered was good -- but not perfect.
After I was paragoned what I was looking for what I was insure I was compared in confront of the waiting.
The add of options in life of the people don't forget the expectations that these are respectancy of the excellence.
And this will be less less soddisftion, even when the results are good people.
None in the marketing world of the marketing world of it.
Because if you know it, you won't know what I'm talking about.
The truth is more like this.
"She was better when he was wors." The reason he was worst when it was worst when it was worst when it was worst was going to be able to meet the surprised surprised of the surprises.
Ogame, in the world that we live -- opulents, industrialized citizens with the perfection -- the male that we can hope is that we can hope is that things are at the higher of way.
You don't have you've ever been pleasant to be expectative, my waitts, my waitts, and they are ingigant.
The secret of happiness -- whose is -- "Baspect."
I mean -- little time I mean, I am really well -- that I really married my wife is really well well well as well.
I could not have a little bit better, I didn't recepted.
But I don't always always have a bad thing.
And finally, a consequence of buy a couple of jeans when there is only that jeans is that when you're not satisface, and you ask yourself, "Why?"
"Who is responsible?" "World."
The world is responsible. What would I do about it?
When there are hundreds of jeans, and you buy a little bit of a jeans, and ask you who is responsible, and you are responsible that you are responsible for yourself is responsible for yourself as you are.
You could do it better.
With hundreds of variety of available -- there are not for the insuccess.
So when people take decisions, even though the result is valid, you feel insatisfied and given the chole.
In the last years the depression is exploded in the industrialized world.
I think a fact that a fact that a fact -- not the unique, but important -- this depression is that people have experiences because the standards, because the standards.
And when they have to explain this situation thinking that the colpe is them.
So the final result is that in general is that we are better, objectively, but we feel like that.
Let me leave you a remind.
This is the official dog, what we all take for good and it's completely failure.
There is no doubly that a little bit of choice is better than I haven't read that a lot of choice is better than a lot of a little bit better than a little bit of a what.
There is a critic, but I don't know what it is.
But I'm sure we have over, fly by a piece of the level that choices choices our lives.
Now, from the political point -- I almost finished -- from the point of view, the follow.
What it allows all this choice in the industrial society is the material society is the material.
There are many places in the world, and you know about a lot of places that the problem is not that have too much choice.
The problem is that they have too much of it.
So the fact that I'm talking about is a malesclusive to be a malesclusive society.
And what makes you depressing and arrablear is this: Steve Levitt told you about iers and seats seats for billbows for billbows for billbooks for money.
I mean that these choices, complicated and dispending, it's not that they are just useful.
They're the deleted deleted it.
They're going to do worse it.
If a little bit about what in our society allows a lot of choice was reversed in those where people have too poorest possible, it would not just be the best life.
This is what economists is called a paretian paretize
A red-red-red-red-red-red-to-poor -- because of this choice in except that it tower us --
To conclude -- you can become all you want to become everything that means --
You know, people of culture, you know, "What do that weigh?
"It's obvious that you can't do anything in a glass of glass."
"As imagination, a vision of the world."
and I was going to be able to do this at the beginning.
But then, think, I realized that that fish, I realized that that fish.
Because the reality of the facts is that if you sent in frank the mouth, so that you can't get the freedom of the paralysis. You get the paralysis.
If you drive the mouth of the mouth of the mouth possible decreation.
You just get the paralysis, and you reduce the well.
They all need a spine.
This is almost certainly too much, perhaps even for us.
But the absence of some symbolic symbolic symbolic and temple, for the rove.
Thank you very much heart.
