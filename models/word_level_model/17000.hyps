<unk> year I showed these <unk> <unk> that the <unk> <unk> <unk>, which for almost three million years had the size of the United States <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> of 40 percent.
We <unk> this <unk> the <unk> of the problem because it doesn't show the ice <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> is, in a certain sense, the heart <unk> of climate system.
It <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> in summer.
The next <unk> will be a <unk> <unk> on the last 25 years.
<unk> <unk> are <unk> in red.
You see, you're going to go to the blue <unk>.
That's the ice in <unk>, which <unk> <unk> in summer.
You can see that the <unk> ice <unk>, five years or more, is like the blood, that's <unk> from the body.
In 25 years, it's been so, in 25 years, so.
This is a problem because the <unk> <unk> <unk> around the ocean, where there are huge <unk> of <unk> <unk> that, <unk> are <unk> in <unk> <unk>.
<unk> to the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, that <unk> could <unk>, that <unk> <unk> <unk>, this <unk> point.
In some <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, the <unk> is already <unk> from water.
The <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> last <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>! Al <unk>: She's good. The question is if you <unk> it.
A reason is that this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> from the north.
This is a river in <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> had never <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This is the <unk> <unk>, in the <unk> of <unk>.
If you want to know how the sea level for the <unk> <unk> on <unk>, here is where <unk> the sea.
These <unk> are <unk> <unk>.
<unk> other part of the planet: <unk>, the greatest <unk> ice on the planet.
<unk> month, <unk> scientists who <unk> that the ice <unk> is in <unk>, and that <unk> <unk> on some <unk> <unk> <unk>, is particularly <unk> in <unk>.
<unk> at six feet of the level of <unk>, like <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, the third largest <unk> <unk>, and they see new <unk>, which a few years ago were <unk>.
40 percent of the world's population <unk> water from that <unk>.
<unk> <unk>: this <unk> is the source of the <unk> water of this city.
The <unk> is <unk>.
But when you <unk>, the same happens to <unk> water.
<unk> <unk> on <unk> <unk> is 40 percent.
<unk> <unk> are in the crisis.
<unk>, like you've read, they're <unk>.
<unk> <unk> in the world <unk> <unk> to a <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> are <unk> to a <unk> out of the normal and <unk>.
Sometimes, over the last 30 years of <unk> <unk>.
This is a <unk> <unk>.
If you look in the context of the <unk> can see the <unk>.
In the last five years we have <unk> 70 million <unk> of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million <unk> in the oceans every day.
Look at the <unk> area, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and on both parts of the <unk> <unk>, and on both parts of the <unk> <unk>, where there is a <unk> <unk> <unk> of oxygen in the oceans.
The greatest <unk> because of global warming, together to <unk>, which is 20 percent, is the use of <unk> <unk>.
<unk> is a problem, and <unk> is even worse than that.
The United States is one of the <unk> countries with China.
And it <unk> to build a lot of other <unk>.
But we're <unk> to a <unk> of direction.
These are the <unk> projects in the last years and some <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
So, there is a <unk> politics in our country.
<unk> <unk> and oil <unk> have <unk> million dollars in the last year to <unk> <unk> <unk>, which is a <unk>.
<unk> picture me, I <unk> something --
<unk> <unk>, in <unk>, where live, there was a <unk> <unk> billion <unk> <unk>.
Maybe you've seen on <unk>.
This is the second largest flow in America.
It's happened around <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> of one of the <unk> <unk> was this.
<unk>: <unk> â™« <unk> <unk> is a <unk> <unk> and happy.
It's <unk> here in America, and it's <unk> our economy.
<unk> the <unk> is <unk> <unk>.
It's <unk>, <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Al <unk>: <unk> is a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The greatest <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. This is his <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> <unk>: <unk> <unk> -- Al <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> -- they don't know what they're talking about.
Al <unk>: So the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> two <unk>.
This is one of them, one part.
<unk>: <unk>: <unk> <unk>, we see the changes as a <unk> <unk> to our business.
So for this <unk> our <unk> is <unk> a big amount of money in a <unk> <unk> to make public truth.
In fact, <unk> is not <unk>.
We think it's <unk> -- it also a good <unk>.
So we don't know about climate change.
We're going to be doing.
<unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk> -- you've heard a lot of it.
So we <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk>, for a <unk> structure, as <unk>.
<unk>! <unk> are a little <unk>, but this is the sound of <unk> technology.
<unk> <unk> is <unk> between the <unk> <unk> <unk>, but the <unk> technology <unk> that you see everything.
Let's look at this: <unk> <unk> technology.
Al <unk>: <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to the economic issue and the national security.
<unk>: <unk>: <unk> America is in crisis; the national <unk>, national <unk> crisis.
The <unk> that <unk> all of the <unk>, our <unk> from <unk> <unk>, like <unk> <unk> and oil oil <unk>.
Now, there is a new, <unk> solution to <unk>.
<unk> America: 100 percent <unk> energy in 10 years.
A <unk> plan to <unk> America to work, <unk> more <unk>, and help <unk> the global warming.
<unk>, a solution that we can solve our problems.
<unk> America. <unk> more.
Al <unk>: This is the last one.
<unk>: <unk>: It's about <unk> energy to America.
One of the most <unk> ways to <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> from <unk> that <unk> our planet.
<unk>: The future is here. <unk>, a new network.
<unk> <unk> 2: <unk> <unk> for jobs <unk> <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> America. It's time to be <unk>.
Al <unk>: A old <unk> <unk> <unk> says, "If you you want to go from, go from alone.
If you want to go away, you go together. "
We have to go far, fast.
Thank you very much.
<unk> year at TED I did a <unk> on <unk>.
And they're going to <unk> to <unk> on how the machine works.
So I <unk> here. And for those who were not, the <unk> is the greatest scientific experiment ever <unk> -- <unk> miles of <unk>.
His task is to <unk> the conditions that were <unk> less than a <unk> <unk> in the universe -- to <unk> million times a second.
All of that is just <unk>.
This is the <unk> machine.
And we're going to be <unk> these <unk> <unk> inside the <unk>.
This is what I work. It's called <unk> -- is <unk> <unk> feet and has a <unk> <unk>.
This is a <unk> picture of <unk> in building so you can see the <unk>.
<unk> <unk> last year, we <unk> the machine for the first time.
And this picture was <unk> by <unk>.
It was because of <unk> <unk> in control.
It's an image of the first <unk> of particles that had made everything around the <unk> of <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, with a part of the <unk>, and <unk> particles inside the <unk>.
In other words, when you <unk> that picture the 10 <unk>, I <unk> that the machine, which is a great <unk>.
I don't know if it was this to <unk> more or this, when somebody <unk> on Google and <unk> page that the <unk> page was this.
That means that we have had a <unk> impact beyond that scientific impact.
And we had a week later, there was a problem with the machine, and it had to be there -- these <unk> <unk> <unk>.
These <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> when the machine works in the <unk> of <unk>.
Now, the <unk> between you are <unk> the <unk> and <unk>, "It's not true. I'm <unk> too <unk>."
And they can do that because when they're very <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk>.
So, <unk> degrees, at least <unk> degrees, to a temperature <unk> to that the space between stars, these <unk> can bring that <unk>.
In one of the <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk>, there was a <unk> <unk>.
So the <unk> <unk> <unk>, and the <unk> <unk> <unk> a electric electric <unk>.
This was the <unk>.
Now, this is even more <unk> if you think that these <unk> <unk> <unk> more than 20 <unk>, and that <unk> <unk> about 30 <unk>.
It's <unk> about 50 <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, what we then did.
We <unk> them and <unk>.
They're now <unk> everybody's <unk>.
<unk> the end of <unk> the <unk> is going to be again.
We <unk> it, and we <unk> to get <unk> data to <unk> or <unk>, and continue to continue to <unk> what the universe are <unk> that <unk> the universe.
Now, of course, in a certain way, these <unk> <unk> the <unk> on science and engineering engineering engineering engineering to <unk>. It's easy to <unk>.
I think that the fact that's so hard, the fact that you can go beyond <unk>, I think it's the value of things like <unk>.
I'd like to end with the words of a <unk> <unk>, which, <unk> <unk>, who, in <unk> <unk> <unk> experiments of his <unk> was Michael <unk>, he said, "No <unk>," <unk> is so <unk> <unk>, and that's not <unk> in nature that the ideas of science are <unk>, that there are no new <unk> in nature that our <unk> are <unk>, and that there are no new <unk>. "
Thank you.
I want to start <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> to when, from children, <unk> <unk>.
As we <unk> as <unk> and <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> <unk> to the way that we <unk> a lot of the world around us.
So, from <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of our <unk> with objects, and <unk> to my <unk> <unk>, and I started <unk> <unk>, and I started <unk>, "And if we use a computer, instead of having the only <unk> <unk> <unk> as digital <unk> that's <unk> on a <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> information with a <unk> information information information information,
and <unk> to our <unk>?
The question was so interesting that I thought I could explore the answer, by building <unk>.
In a few words, a <unk> is a <unk> computer <unk>.
In a few words, a <unk> is a <unk> computer <unk>.
You can <unk> them with your hand, "<unk>" <unk> "one one, feel their <unk>, and they have a <unk> radio <unk>.
But <unk>, they're <unk> objects, like <unk>, you can just <unk>.
<unk> are the example of a new <unk> to <unk> the digital information.
And as they become more <unk>, <unk> of the <unk>, the other, and as you get <unk>, the <unk> of the <unk>, the <unk> of the <unk>, the other, how we <unk> them, we can explore new <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
It's going to start with some simple example.
This <unk> is <unk> to show you about video: if you put it in a direction, the video <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, if you <unk> on the other side, it's going to be <unk>.
These <unk> <unk> are <unk> of others.
If you <unk> them, you're going to be <unk>.
If they're <unk>, <unk> and they can <unk> a little bit.
If they're <unk>, <unk> and they can <unk> a little bit.
And they also <unk> their <unk> and <unk>.
We have been <unk> that one of the interesting <unk> of <unk> was the <unk> that we could be common on data, for example, "<unk> a color as if it was a <unk>.
In this case, we have three <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and I can <unk> to <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> to <unk> color, where you're <unk>.
and I can <unk> to <unk> the color in the <unk>, where they <unk>.
If we <unk> too much, we can <unk> a little bit of a place.
There are also a chance to <unk>, like <unk>, <unk>, <unk> and games where people can try things, and <unk> the results that are going to be able to <unk> the results.
Now I'm --
This is a <unk> sequence that I do with a <unk> program.
Here we have a <unk> game here that's <unk> half of <unk> and <unk>.
<unk>, every <unk> <unk> a letter to <unk> on every <unk>, <unk>, every <unk> <unk> a letter to <unk>, on every <unk>, and while I was <unk> to <unk> words on a <unk>.
Then, about 30 seconds, you <unk>, and you have a new <unk> of <unk> and new possibilities to try.
Thank you.
Here's what <unk> <unk> in <unk> at the <unk> <unk>, I made them so that I <unk> them and <unk> a video.
They're very <unk>.
And one of the interesting things about this kind of <unk> is that you don't have to give people a lot.
You just say, "<unk> <unk> of words," and they know what to do.
Here's there are other people who <unk> it.
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk>, there on the right.
It actually wanted to <unk>.
They were just <unk>, for him.
Now, this is a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
You could build a <unk> tool for the <unk> of <unk>. He's <unk>.
It can <unk> new characters in the scene, and they <unk> their <unk>.
It can <unk> new characters in the scene, and they <unk> their <unk>.
Here, it's doing the sun.
<unk>: The sun is <unk>.
David <unk>: Now he brought a <unk> in the scene.
<unk>: <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>! Yes!
So we <unk> the <unk> and <unk> can <unk> the characters --
<unk>: <unk>!
<unk> your story.
<unk>: <unk>!
<unk>: It's a story with the <unk>, and it can decide how to be <unk>.
<unk>: It's a story with the <unk>, and it can decide how to be <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> away, <unk>.
<unk>: The last example I have time to show you is a <unk>, and I've recently recently, to <unk> and <unk> music.
it's a <unk>, and recently recently, to <unk> and <unk> music.
The <unk> here is <unk> <unk> as base, <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> of these has four different <unk>, and you can choose to use.
You can also <unk> these <unk> in a sequence of <unk> <unk>.
And they just <unk> a <unk> <unk> a sound and a <unk>. "
These are actually that you can control live, like <unk> and <unk>.
We <unk> it to a particular sound and then <unk> to <unk>.
And then there are <unk> effects as time and <unk>, that <unk> to the whole sequence.
It's going to be <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk> a base in two <unk>, "sequence, <unk> in a series, the <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
Now let's take a <unk> line.
<unk>: <unk>: Now, <unk> <unk> <unk> --
<unk>: <unk>: I'm going to <unk> the <unk> to <unk>, so I can control the effect from live.
<unk>: <unk>: I can <unk> the whole <unk> <unk> the time on a side or on the other.
<unk>: <unk>: I'm going to <unk> the <unk> <unk> to give <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>: I can <unk> the sequence of <unk>.
So I don't have to <unk> before, but I can <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
And now, finally, I can <unk> the whole sequence on the left the <unk> <unk>.
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is to build new <unk> <unk> and more <unk> to how our brain work.
And today, I had time to show you one of the results of this <unk>, and even some possibilities that we're trying to bring out of the lab.
The concept I want to <unk> is that it's <unk> this new generation of <unk> objects to <unk> with the media, which is <unk> information in our world in the way that we want.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the time to talk to all of you.
I'm a <unk>.
<unk> books is my <unk>, but it's more than that, of course.
It's also the love and the <unk> of my life.
And I don't look like that it can change.
But, I said this, something particular happened in my life and my career, who <unk> me to <unk> the whole relationship with this work.
The particular thing is that I <unk> wrote this book, this <unk> called "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And the result is that everywhere I'm going to be now, people <unk> me as if I were <unk>.
<unk> -- <unk>, <unk>!
I'm going to be <unk>, and they say, "You're not afraid to be able to do better?
You're not going to continue to write all the life without having to be able to create a book that can <unk> to somebody? "
that can <unk> to somebody? "
It's <unk>, you know.
But it could be worse, and I remember more than 20 years ago, when I started to say to people -- I was a <unk> -- I wanted to be a <unk>.
I'm going to get to the same <unk> <unk>.
And people said to me, "Don't <unk> to be able to be able to be able to be?
You don't fear that the <unk> of <unk> <unk> you <unk>?
You don't fear to be <unk> for all life without anything that you're going to be <unk> on and <unk> to die on a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>? "
So you know, you know.
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is, "You know."
Yeah, I fear of all those things.
I've always had fear.
And I also fear of many other things that people can't happen.
It's like <unk> and other things.
But, as much about the <unk> I thought and I thought <unk> is why?
Is it <unk>?
It's <unk> that anybody who who <unk> <unk> to be <unk> by a job that <unk> you're <unk> to do.
But what is that there is so <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> in a way that other <unk> don't do?
How do my father, for example, he was a <unk> <unk> and I don't remember one time in his <unk> years of activity in which he was asked if she were to be <unk>?
It never was -- that <unk> of <unk> <unk> John, how does it go?
Don't you look like this, <unk>?
<unk>, the engineers <unk> like a group <unk> don't have certainly no, in <unk>, <unk> the <unk> to be <unk> <unk>.
We <unk>, we have enough this <unk>, and not only <unk> but <unk> of all that, we have this <unk> to be <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And it's not going to be <unk> to the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that, only in the <unk> century, <unk> young people and often for them.
And even those who are not <unk> to be really <unk> by their <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, before he died, in the last <unk> said, "Every book my book has <unk> me a little bit more <unk>." And I <unk> <unk> about the work of their life.
But we don't <unk> <unk> when we say, because we heard these things so long that we have <unk> and <unk> the <unk> that creativity and <unk> are some <unk> and <unk> the <unk> that creativity and <unk> are some <unk> and <unk> are <unk> in some ways, and then <unk> always <unk> to <unk>.
And the question I want to tell you all here today is, you agree with this idea?
It's good for you, because it's also <unk> by a <unk> distance to me, it's not good for anything that <unk>.
I think it's <unk>.
And I think it's also <unk> and I don't want to <unk> <unk> in the next century.
I think it's better <unk> our great <unk> to live.
And I certainly know that, in my case -- it would be very <unk> to start <unk> to <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk>
<unk> -- <unk> look at it's quite young, I have about 40 years.
I still have about four <unk> of work in me.
And it's very <unk> that anything that's going to happen in the world like the work that I <unk> after <unk> <unk> <unk> in my last book.
<unk> <unk>, because we're all <unk>, <unk> friends here -- is <unk> that my greatest success is to my <unk>.
Oh, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>!
You know this is the kind of thought that brings a person to start <unk> at nine in the morning, and I don't want to do it.
I'm going to continue to do this work that I love.
So, the question becomes, how?
And so I think about, after many <unk>, that the way to work to continue to continue to continue to write this is to create a <unk> <unk> <unk>, OK?
I have to have to come to some <unk> distance between me, which I'm <unk>, and the natural <unk> on what <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. And while I was going to go through this last year models of how to do that <unk> to look through the time, trying to find some other society to be better ideas and <unk>.
about how to help people <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity.
And that research led me to the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
It's because we <unk> in <unk> and then <unk> back.
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> -- people don't believe that creativity from men, OK?
It <unk> that creativity was this <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> to men from some <unk> <unk> and <unk>, for <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> <unk> these <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity. "
<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> to have a <unk> <unk> <unk> from <unk>.
The <unk> were in the idea, but we had that kind of spirit without a <unk>.
The one that's <unk>, because the <unk> didn't really know that a <unk> was somebody particularly.
And I thought a <unk> <unk> species that <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> literally in the <unk> of the study of a artist, a little bit like <unk> <unk>, and that <unk> out of <unk> <unk> the work of the artist and <unk> the result of that work.
<unk> <unk> <unk>, that's the distance distance of which I'm talking -- that <unk> <unk> you from the results of your work.
And everybody <unk> that was so <unk> that we were so <unk>, right?
So, the artists were <unk> by <unk> things, like, for example, the too <unk>, isn't it?
If your work was <unk>, you didn't <unk> <unk> all the <unk>, all <unk> that <unk> state of <unk> <unk> <unk>.
If your work <unk>, it wasn't all <unk>, right?
Everybody <unk> that was your <unk> to be a <unk>.
And so people <unk> <unk> creativity in <unk> for a long time.
Then the <unk> <unk> and <unk>, and we <unk> this big idea; we put the human being in the center of the universe above all the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> no <unk> space to <unk> from <unk>.
This was the <unk> principle and people started thinking about that creativity is completely from <unk>.
And for the first time in history, it <unk> to <unk> to this or that artist as a rather <unk> <unk> to a person with <unk>.
And I have to <unk>, I think it was a big <unk>.
I think that <unk> to somebody, a simple person who believe that I think of being like a <unk> like the source, <unk> and <unk> <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, <unk> and <unk> and <unk> it is a responsibility to be too big to give human <unk>.
It's like to somebody to <unk> the sun.
<unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> the <unk> and <unk> all these <unk> <unk> on the <unk>.
And I think it's been this pressure to <unk> the <unk> 500 years.
And, if this is true, and I think it's the question, is it, the question becomes, and now?
Can we <unk> it?
We want to go back to a <unk> understanding of human relationship and <unk> <unk>.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we can't <unk> 500 years of thinking in a 18 minutes.
And there are probably people in the audience who <unk> <unk> <unk> on their <unk>, <unk>, you do that <unk> people <unk> <unk> on their projects.
You probably probably probably probably <unk> on this thing.
But the question I'd like to tell you about is -- why not?
Why don't we <unk> this way?
Because it's more sense than anything that I've ever heard to explain the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
A process that, as anyone who ever <unk> to do something -- so, so basically, all you here -- knows, you don't <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And in fact, it can be completely <unk>.
I did this <unk> <unk> with the extraordinary <unk> <unk>, who has now 90 years, but that's been a <unk> <unk> for life and said that during his <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> out of the <unk> <unk>, <unk> out in the <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> out in the <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> out of the <unk>.
She said, he was like a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And that <unk> <unk> to her from <unk>.
We could get it, because he was <unk> the land under his feet.
I thought I had one thing to do at that point and was, words, "<unk> as a <unk>."
And so he was <unk> to home and he was <unk> by this <unk>, and it wouldn't have to be able to take a piece of paper and a <unk> enough enough to be <unk>, <unk> and <unk> on page.
<unk> times, we couldn't get enough fast, so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> without able to get to home and <unk> the <unk> <unk> through the <unk> and <unk> the <unk> through the <unk>, and he would <unk> <unk> through the <unk>, and then he would <unk> <unk> through the <unk>, and he would <unk> through the <unk>, and he would <unk> the <unk> <unk> through the <unk>, and he
Then there were those times -- this was never <unk> -- there were moments when the almost <unk> was almost <unk>, OK?
So, he was <unk> at home and he was trying to <unk> and <unk> the <unk> through, and he was <unk> a <unk> <unk> right, and he was <unk>, and he was like if you <unk> with the other hand and <unk>.
<unk> the <unk> from the tail and the <unk> in his body and the <unk> on the page.
And in these cases, the <unk> would be <unk> on the <unk> page and <unk>, but <unk>, the last word to the <unk> word to the first word to the first word to the first word to the <unk>.
So when you <unk> <unk> -- it's <unk>, it's exactly <unk> to my <unk> process.
Not all my <unk> process -- I'm not a <unk>!
I'm a <unk>, and my way of <unk> is <unk>; it <unk> at the same <unk> every day and <unk> and work on and <unk> on <unk>.
But even I even, in my <unk>, I <unk> against that thing, sometimes.
And I think many of you the <unk> made.
You know, even if the work and ideas <unk> me <unk> me to be <unk> by a <unk> source I could not be <unk>.
And what is this thing?
And how can we <unk> it so that you can't lose your head, but rather, that <unk> <unk> us?
As a <unk> <unk>.
<unk> talking about this, and you know, <unk>, for the <unk> of life has been the <unk> of the <unk> artist's been <unk> <unk>, trying to control, <unk> these <unk> species of <unk> <unk> <unk>.
But then <unk>, he was <unk>, and one day while she was <unk> on a <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> everything for him.
You're going fast and everything of a <unk> <unk> this little <unk> of <unk>, that comes in his head as <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and the wants, you know, it's wonderful, and the <unk>, but it doesn't know how to <unk>.
It's not a <unk> piece, it's not a <unk>, it's not a <unk>.
So it starts to feel this kind of old <unk> <unk> that you know, "I'm going to lose, and <unk> <unk> <unk> from this <unk> song.
I'm not quite <unk> and I can't <unk>. "
And instead of going to go to the <unk>, they <unk>.
He <unk> the whole <unk> process and made something completely new.
He just <unk> the sky and he said, "<unk>, you don't see I'm <unk>?"
"Do you think it can write a song now?"
If you really want to <unk>, you'll be <unk> when I can take care of you.
<unk>, <unk> to <unk> more today.
I'm going to start <unk> <unk> <unk>. "
And his process <unk> <unk> after this.
Not the work, the work was still <unk> as always.
But the process, and the <unk> <unk> that <unk> was <unk> when he <unk> the <unk>, the <unk> that he had been <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> out of the problems and <unk> it back from where, <unk> was <unk> that it didn't have to be a <unk> and <unk>.
but he <unk> this <unk>, wonderful <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> and this thing that <unk> and <unk> that <unk>, but it wasn't <unk>.
So, how <unk> that <unk> story to change a little bit of a way I <unk> and I'm <unk> and already <unk> me once.
This idea, I <unk> when I was <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>," and I <unk>, and I <unk> in one of those <unk> <unk>, and we're not working on something and we're not going to be a <unk>, that's going to be a <unk>, that's going to be a <unk>, which will be the <unk> book.
Not just <unk>, just <unk> <unk> book.
And we started thinking about <unk> this project.
But then I <unk> to <unk> that <unk> and <unk> us.
So I <unk> my face on the <unk> and I <unk> my <unk> to a <unk> <unk> of the room.
And I said <unk>, "<unk>," <unk>, "<unk>," What, we know if this book is not going to be <unk>, right? "
Because how you see I'm <unk> everything I have, I don't have this.
So if you want to be better, you have to <unk> and do your part.
OK. But if you don't do that, you know what, you know, you're not going to tell me anything about it.
I started writing the same because it's my work.
And I want to say, please, I'm <unk> to me to do my part of my part. "Because, that's so, OK -- <unk> does it in the <unk> Africa's <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> music that <unk> on for hours to <unk> to <unk> hours to <unk>.
And they were always <unk>, because the <unk> were <unk> and <unk>.
But every so much, <unk>, something <unk>, and one of these <unk> artists actually <unk>.
And I know you know what, because I know I know that you've all seen, at some point, a <unk> <unk>.
It was like if the time <unk> <unk>, and the <unk> <unk> through a kind of <unk> and it was not doing anything different from the <unk>, like <unk> <unk> <unk> before, but everything <unk>.
And suddenly it doesn't just <unk> as a human.
But it <unk> from <unk> and <unk> <unk> in the fire of <unk>.
And when this <unk>, at time, people <unk> what he was, he <unk> it with his name.
<unk> your hands and <unk> to <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, God," God, "God," God, "God," God, "God," God, "God," God, "God,". "
That's God, you know.
<unk> <unk> -- when the <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk>, I <unk> this <unk> with them and <unk> <unk> in <unk> by "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>,
In <unk>, when a artist has done something impossible and <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>," <unk>, <unk> <unk> -- a <unk> of God.
And it's <unk> because we need.
But the problem comes up the day after, for <unk>, when you <unk> and <unk> <unk> that are the 11 <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's just a <unk> <unk> <unk>, and maybe never <unk> to <unk> that <unk> to <unk>.
And maybe nobody <unk> the name of God still <unk> as <unk>, and so it has to do with the rest of his life?
It's hard.
This is one of the <unk> <unk> to do in a <unk> life.
But maybe it doesn't have to be so <unk> if you can't believe, <unk>, that the most <unk> <unk> of your being from yourself.
But just <unk> that you're <unk> in <unk> from a source of this <unk> part of your life that you have to go to <unk> you to <unk> you.
And, you know, if we think it's all about it.
And so I started to <unk>, and it's certainly like I <unk> it for several months during the <unk> <unk>'s book that I'm going to <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And what I have to continue to <unk> when I feel like this is, I'm not afraid.
Don't <unk>. You're just <unk> your work.
You can be <unk> for your side, any <unk> can be.
If your work is <unk>, <unk>.
If the <unk>, you're going to be <unk> <unk> <unk> some kind of <unk>, for a only moment through your <unk>, then <unk>!
You're going to say, your <unk>.
And "<unk>!" You're <unk> the same.
I think it's <unk> <unk>.
"<unk>!" You're the same, even for having <unk> love and <unk> <unk> <unk> by <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk>: <unk>!
You know about some of these projects on the human genome, what can <unk> and <unk> on the <unk> of new genes.
We're now <unk> a new way, we started <unk> the biology and now start to <unk> this digital code, we're <unk> in a new <unk> of biology, <unk> and <unk> life.
We've always been trying to <unk> big questions.
"<unk> is the life?" It's something that many <unk>, I think have <unk> to understand at various levels.
We tried different <unk>, <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We're <unk> for almost 20 years now.
When we <unk> the human genome <unk> to go from the <unk> world of biology to the digital world.
Now we <unk>: can we <unk> life, or create new life from this digital universe?
This is the map of a little <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, which is the species from the <unk> genome between those that can <unk> into the lab.
And we tried to reduce the genome to <unk> one even smaller smaller.
We're able to <unk> a <unk> of genes that are here.
But when we take a look at his <unk> map, it's <unk> simple than our.
<unk>, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can <unk>, one at the time, it's very <unk> that this can bring a <unk> cell.
So we thought the only <unk> <unk> was <unk> this <unk> so that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> some of these questions.
And so we started the <unk> of "<unk> we can <unk> a <unk>?"
Can the chemistry <unk> to produce these great molecules that we never could be able to create before?
And, in case, can we make a <unk>?
A <unk> is just a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The speed with which we are able to <unk> life is <unk> to <unk>.
Our ability to write the code, rather slowly, but it's <unk> slowly, but it's <unk>.
And our <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We have more than 15 years ago.
The process has <unk> a lot of <unk>, <unk> with a <unk> <unk> before that <unk> the early experiments.
But we found that DNA <unk> is very difficult.
There are <unk> of thousands of machines in the world that <unk> little <unk> of DNA <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, and it's a <unk> process, the more <unk> is <unk>, the more <unk> there are.
So we had to develop a new <unk> to <unk> these <unk> and <unk> the <unk>.
And this was our first <unk>, starting from <unk> information of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's a little <unk> that <unk> bacteria.
We designed <unk>, we <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> a DNA <unk> of about <unk> <unk>.
The interesting part is when we took this piece of <unk> material <unk> and we <unk> it in bacteria, bacteria have <unk> to read this code and <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> are <unk> by cells, they <unk> back and they <unk> the <unk> <unk>.
I've been talking about with <unk> <unk> <unk> that they certainly <unk> this model.
They have more than you.
And it <unk> that this is a situation where the software can actually build its own own <unk> in a <unk> system.
But we can do things in the greatest.
You could build the whole <unk> of <unk>.
I'm more than <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
So we thought we were <unk> in <unk> of the virus, so that we can change the <unk> to understand what the <unk> of a <unk> cell.
<unk> is <unk>, and if you <unk> information information in a computer, they need to be very <unk>.
When you <unk> this genome for the first time in <unk> the <unk> <unk> was a <unk> for every 10 <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We've found, <unk> <unk>, 30 <unk>. If we were using that original sequence never <unk> that original sequence.
One part of the process is design <unk> 50 <unk> that <unk> with all the other <unk> <unk> of 50 <unk> to build smaller <unk> that <unk> together.
And you're going to be <unk> here.
You probably read that <unk> us from <unk>.
<unk> <unk>: We have a <unk> <unk> code on four <unk>: A, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> of those <unk> <unk> together <unk> about 20 <unk>, and there's a <unk> order to <unk> every <unk>.
So we can use the code to write words, <unk>, <unk>.
What we did at the beginning was <unk>.
Some have been <unk> by the fact that it wasn't <unk>.
We designed these <unk> to <unk> simply <unk> with <unk>.
There are <unk> that <unk> them and <unk> <unk> them.
And we started to <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to them.
At every step, we have made these <unk> in <unk> so that we're <unk> to make a <unk> <unk> that we're going to be able to create a very <unk> <unk> as you're going to see in a minute.
We're trying to <unk> the process.
So this looks like a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
When you start these <unk> <unk> <unk>, more than 100 <unk> <unk>, you're not going to be <unk> directly in the <unk> <unk>.
You get to the <unk> of the <unk> biology.
So we have <unk> other <unk>.
We're going to be <unk> by <unk> <unk>, which in biology <unk> to <unk> the DNA to <unk> the <unk>.
Here's an example.
This <unk>, called <unk> <unk>, can <unk> three million <unk> <unk>.
You can see in the <unk> <unk> as his <unk> <unk> is <unk>.
In 12 -- it's <unk> <unk> exactly how it was before.
<unk> thousands of organisms that are able to do that.
These organisms can <unk> completely <unk>.
We're going to live under <unk>.
I'm absolutely sure that life <unk> in space, and they <unk> to find new <unk> of water.
<unk>, NASA showed that this is.
This is an <unk> picture that we built by using these <unk>, just by using the <unk> with the <unk> design of <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This is not <unk> with a <unk> <unk>, but with a <unk> <unk>.
It's so <unk> that big we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk>.
These are pictures that <unk> a period of about six seconds.
This is the <unk> that we've done a little time ago.
I'm more than <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's the greatest <unk> of a <unk> <unk> <unk> that's ever <unk> by human man.
It's got a <unk> weight for 300 million.
If you <unk> it with a <unk> 10 <unk>, and we <unk> pages to <unk> this code.
Now, how do we make it work? How can we <unk>?
<unk>, by a <unk> is a <unk> game.
It's a little bit more <unk> when you're using bacteria.
It's more simple than that when it's about <unk> cells as our -- you can just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> another, which is basically the process of <unk>.
In <unk>, we <unk> the <unk> is instead of <unk> inside the cell, but we <unk> <unk> that we are able to make a <unk> <unk> of a <unk> <unk> from a cell to another and <unk>.
We <unk> a <unk> <unk> from a species.
<unk> are different <unk> than men from <unk>.
We <unk> some <unk> in a way that we could decide what to do for this <unk>.
He's <unk> it to <unk> all the <unk>.
And when we put it in the cell was <unk> and <unk> our <unk> <unk> the new <unk> went to the new <unk> went inside.
And we <unk> <unk> that we didn't go beyond, but we tried to <unk> more in there.
This is one of the major <unk> of evolution.
We found that <unk> species have <unk> a second or a third <unk> <unk> from some <unk>, <unk> in a second thousands of new <unk> to that species.
So who thinks about evolution as a only <unk> <unk> at the time that <unk> has not a lot of biology.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> DNA.
The <unk> that was in the cell, they didn't know.
The <unk> <unk> we <unk> it.
It's <unk>, and he <unk> the other <unk> like <unk> material, and it <unk> it, and we <unk> with only the cell and the new <unk>.
It became blue because of the genes we <unk>.
And in a short <unk> of time, all the <unk> of a species are <unk>, and it <unk> of all the <unk> of a new species, <unk> on software that we <unk> in the cell.
All the <unk> are <unk>, <unk> are <unk>, and when you <unk> the <unk> code that we <unk> the code that we <unk>.
Now, this may seem <unk> <unk>, but we can <unk> the software, we can change things in a fairly <unk>.
Now, I've already <unk> that there is no <unk> -- but of progress at three million years and a half million years and a half million years and a half million evolution, and I already said that maybe we're going to create a new <unk> <unk> species on this digital process.
Why do that?
I think it's pretty <unk> when we think about our <unk>.
We're going to go from six and a half billion people in the next 40 years.
Just to give a example, I was born in <unk>.
Now there are three people on the planet to <unk> <unk> in <unk>; in 40 years, there will be four.
We're <unk> problems now to find food, <unk> and <unk>, <unk> and <unk> and <unk> for six billion and a half billion people.
We're going to have to do it for nine billion.
<unk> more than five billion <unk> <unk>.
That means 100 million <unk> a day.
When we're trying to find <unk> <unk>, or any kind of process to <unk>, it's going to be a huge challenge.
We have to realize that all the <unk> of CO2 from these materials that <unk> in the atmosphere.
At the day, because of the <unk> <unk> in the world, we have a <unk> with about 20 million genes, and I like to think that are <unk> <unk> for the future.
The industry <unk> only a <unk> about <unk>, and think about how many different things are out.
Our <unk> here is <unk> data from the reality <unk> and our imagination.
We have now <unk>, because of these <unk> <unk> <unk>, that can create what we call <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We're able to build a big robot that can produce a million <unk> a day.
Think about <unk> these 20 million genes or <unk> to try to <unk> the <unk> to produce <unk> or <unk>, new <unk>, we can change, because of a little team, and create more <unk> biology that in the last 20 years of science.
And it's just a standard <unk>.
We can choose to <unk>, chemistry <unk> <unk>, chemistry <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This is a <unk> of some software <unk> that we're working on to be able to <unk> and design species to computers.
Well, we don't know how they're going to be.
We know exactly what their <unk> code.
Now we're going to be <unk> on the <unk> generation.
You've seen you that <unk> <unk> from <unk> was a <unk> experiment.
We <unk> <unk> <unk> and third generation that <unk> enough soon from <unk> to <unk> <unk> than <unk> or different kinds of <unk>.
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the <unk> would be <unk> CO2 in matter before, so we're working for <unk> cells that can achieve that to get to design cells that can achieve that to be able to achieve that purpose, and we think we can achieve that purpose, and we can have the <unk> of the <unk> generation.
<unk> <unk> <unk> with CO2 is a <unk>, but in our <unk> <unk>, we found different <unk>.
This is a <unk> that we <unk> in <unk>.
<unk> in the deep ocean, about <unk> feet of <unk> at the temperature of <unk> of water.
It's <unk> <unk> by CO2, <unk> as a source of energy.
We're trying to understand if we can <unk> CO2, that can easily be <unk> by <unk>, <unk> that CO2 in <unk>, to drive this process.
So, <unk> we think that we could be able to <unk> what the basic question, "which is life, we <unk>, we <unk> the <unk> goal to <unk> the whole industry.
<unk>. If you can't do that from TED, where can't do it?
It's going to be a <unk> source of energy.
<unk>, we're working for the same <unk> to create <unk> <unk>.
You've seen this year with flu, we've always come back a year and with a dollar in less when it's about to find the <unk> right.
I think what you can change by building <unk> <unk> in <unk>.
Here's how the future could start to be <unk>, now, the tree of evolution, <unk> the tree, <unk> the tree of evolution, <unk> cells.
We're so so that's about <unk> people.
Our purpose is to make enough to live enough to <unk>. Thank you very much.
First of all, I'm going to show you, the <unk> <unk>, some fundamental work, in the technology that we took to <unk> on a <unk> <unk>. It's <unk>.
It's a environment where you can <unk> is at the local level that <unk> with a huge amount of data.
Here we are seeing <unk> <unk> <unk> with a kind of <unk> <unk> and <unk>, for a quick <unk>, <unk> the images like we want.
And it doesn't matter how big the amount of information that we see, how big these <unk> are these <unk> of data or data.
Most of them are common photographs, but this is a <unk> <unk> from <unk> <unk>, and <unk> in the <unk> of <unk>, and <unk> in the <unk> <unk>.
It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that <unk> the <unk> of a system like this is the number of <unk> on your screen in any moment. It's also a very <unk> architecture.
This is a whole book, example of data doesn't images.
This is <unk> <unk> <unk>. Every <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk>.
To <unk> that it's about <unk> and not about images, we can do something like that, to be really, to be able to see that it's a real <unk> of text, not a picture.
It could be a way that's a little <unk> to read a book.
I'm not going to tell you.
This is a more <unk> example. This is a number of the <unk>.
Every picture is the beginning of a <unk>.
And it really gives you the <unk> and the beautiful experience of reading the real version of a <unk> or a <unk>, which is for nature a <unk> kind of <unk>.
We also did something with the corner of this particular <unk> of the <unk>.
We created a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> much than what you use is using in a normal <unk> <unk> and we <unk> <unk> <unk>.
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk>, you can see here.
Or other models, or even <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And this really <unk> some of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of space on screen.
And I think this <unk> <unk> to <unk> and other <unk> like that, you can't be <unk>.
Of course, <unk> is one of the most <unk> <unk> for this kind of technology.
And on this, I don't want to lose time, if not to say that we have <unk> to give this <unk>.
These are all the streets in the United States <unk> above a NASA <unk> picture.
So now we're going to do something else.
This is now actually live on the web; you can see it.
This is a project called <unk>, which is <unk> two different technologies.
One is <unk> and the other is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, a <unk> <unk> student, a <unk> <unk> student of Washington, with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And it's live on the web, <unk> <unk>.
You can see when we do this kind of <unk>, where we can go from a picture and have this kind of experience to <unk> <unk>.
But the <unk> <unk> of images here is actually a meaning.
The <unk> <unk> of the computer <unk> these pictures, so that <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> are <unk> that <unk> all <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> have been <unk>. Here you see the elements of the elements of a <unk> <unk> or <unk>, and these things are all <unk> on the <unk> level.
I don't know if I have time to show you some other environment.
There are some much more <unk>.
I want to go directly to one of the <unk> <unk> data and this <unk> from a <unk> <unk> <unk> that we have done for the first time, I <unk> to show you what's really the key behind this technology, the <unk> technology. And it's not <unk> <unk> <unk>, looking at the <unk> that we have in the website.
We had to <unk> some <unk> and so forth.
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> images of kinds of <unk>, and <unk> <unk> of <unk>, other <unk> and so on. <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> a picture that's discovery that <unk> a picture is discovery to this model.
So I'm all <unk> pictures and they were all <unk> at the <unk> level in this way.
And it's possible to <unk> this <unk> way.
You know, I would never have thought to work for <unk>.
It's very <unk> <unk> this kind of <unk> here.
I think you can see that it's a lot of different kinds of <unk>: that's what these <unk> are <unk>, a <unk> number, <unk> together in this environment.
And if I can do, I can <unk> to try and <unk> those <unk>.
Many are <unk> <unk>, etc.
<unk> here is a series of photographs -- <unk>.
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We can go from <unk> to the physics of this environment.
The <unk> point is that we can do things with social environment. This is now <unk> data from <unk> <unk> from the whole memory of <unk> as <unk> the earth, from the <unk> <unk>, from the <unk> <unk> and <unk> all that data together.
All of those pictures become <unk> together, more than the <unk>.
You have a <unk> model that <unk>.
Think about this as <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on Earth <unk>.
It's something that <unk> in complexity that people <unk>, and the <unk> that you're going to <unk> <unk> with <unk>.
Their pictures are <unk> with <unk> <unk> by other people.
If somebody comes to <unk> all these <unk> <unk> the name, my <unk> picture of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> all of that data, and I can use it as a <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> in that space, that <unk>, using the picture of <unk> in that space, that <unk>, using the <unk> of <unk>.
Of course, a <unk> of this is <unk> models that are extremely <unk> of every interesting part of the land, <unk> not only from <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I realized? What do you know? What your software <unk> us to do is that at some point, in the next years, all the photographs that's going to anybody in the whole world will be <unk> together?
<unk>: Yeah. What's doing is basically <unk>.
It's creating <unk>, if you want, <unk> <unk>.
And it's doing it in the <unk> content.
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about <unk> information information that many of these <unk> images.
As you do a research images on the web, you <unk> a <unk> and the text page on the web page has a lot of information about the pictures.
Now, what happens if that picture <unk> all of your picture?
So the amount of <unk> <unk> and the amount of <unk> that <unk> is really enormous. It's a <unk> <unk> effect.
CA: <unk>, it's really incredible. <unk>.
<unk>: I'm going to tell you very much.
One of the major <unk> when they <unk> and one of the <unk> research is that that we can live in who <unk> the past the wind <unk>, who <unk> the past the wind, the <unk> <unk> it in the <unk> <unk> from <unk>, the <unk> <unk> it in the <unk> <unk> <unk> of plants.
You think <unk> <unk> still <unk> <unk> even beyond the <unk> <unk>, or that <unk> <unk> <unk> are still <unk> <unk> <unk>, or <unk> <unk> <unk>, or <unk> <unk> <unk>, or <unk> <unk> <unk>, and the idea that the world that the idea that the world in which the idea that the world in which the idea that the world in which we live in in a sense, but it's just a <unk> model.
the <unk> of a particular particular <unk> of <unk> choices that our <unk> has done, good or evil, a lot of <unk> does.
And, of course, all of the <unk> <unk>.
Everybody <unk>. <unk>.
We're <unk> to <unk> <unk>.
We have to <unk> the death <unk>, so we can't <unk> it, and <unk> --
We all have a art.
What <unk> is the <unk> of the <unk> of the song, the <unk> of <unk> every culture.
It doesn't matter that they're the <unk> <unk>, or the <unk> of <unk> <unk>, or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, or a <unk> in the <unk> <unk>.
He was my <unk> of a journey in <unk> a month ago, or a <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk>, the <unk> mother's <unk>.
All of these <unk> <unk> that there are other ways of <unk> to think, other ways of thinking, other ways of moving in the world.
And, if you <unk> a moment, it's a concept that can give you hope.
<unk>, the <unk> <unk> of the world create a <unk> <unk> and <unk> that <unk> the planet and it's important for the <unk> of the planet, as the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And you can think about this <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and you can <unk> the <unk> of all the <unk>, the <unk> of all the <unk>, <unk>, dreams, <unk>, ideas, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> in being from the human imagination.
<unk> is the <unk> <unk> of humanity.
It's the <unk> of what we are and what we can be as as a <unk> species.
And <unk> the <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> happened to <unk> and <unk> very quickly.
<unk> <unk>, for example, <unk> that 50 percent of all species has been or is on the <unk> of <unk>, just because it's <unk>, or <unk> <unk> -- in the <unk> <unk> -- in the <unk> of <unk> diversity -- and not even <unk> to <unk> <unk> -- that's <unk> diversity.
The <unk> of this is, of course, <unk> <unk>.
When you're <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on this planet.
It's not just <unk> by a <unk> or a series of rules.
One is the <unk> of the human spirit.
It's the middle of the <unk> that the <unk> of every culture is coming in in the material material.
Every language is a forest of the mind, a <unk>, a <unk> <unk>, a <unk> of <unk>.
And of those <unk> <unk>, as we're sitting here at least half the <unk> is not <unk> in the <unk> of children.
They're not <unk> to children, which means less than <unk> something, who are <unk>.
What's more <unk> than being <unk> by <unk>, the last one of the <unk>, the <unk>, the not to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of <unk> <unk> or <unk> the children?
This <unk> <unk> was a <unk> of somebody in a few weeks, every two weeks, every two weeks, a <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> it <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> of a <unk> language.
And I know that somebody of you say, "Don't you know?
The world would not be a better place if we <unk> all the same language? "<unk>, then we're talking to all about <unk>.
<unk> <unk>.
<unk> of a <unk> thing that means that they can't speak their language.
Today I'd like to show you a journey through the <unk> --
a little journey in the <unk> to give you a <unk> of what we're <unk>.
Many of us <unk> that when I say, "different ways of <unk>," I mean, "I really mean different ways of <unk>.
<unk> for example, <unk> <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, which <unk> to the <unk> <unk> from the river <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's a <unk> that's not able to <unk> the blue color from green because the green <unk> because the <unk> <unk> is <unk> in the forest, so that they <unk> the <unk>.
They have a <unk> language and a <unk> rule, <unk> <unk> <unk>, "<unk> <unk>, you have to <unk> a different language.
All of this has <unk> in the past <unk>, <unk> is that in these families <unk> where you're talking about six or seven <unk> because of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, no <unk> language.
It <unk> to listen to and then <unk> to talk to.
I <unk> one of the most interesting <unk> that I lived, the <unk> <unk> <unk>, an incredible <unk> that had the first <unk> in <unk>.
In <unk>, five <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
They made <unk> from the top of the photographs that <unk> the <unk> <unk>, <unk> that this <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that had never seen anything about <unk>.
They <unk> the picture, they <unk> the <unk> to <unk> a form or a <unk> and, not <unk> <unk>, they <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and they <unk> the five <unk> with <unk>.
But <unk> don't only <unk> the <unk>.
It <unk> to be <unk> in their own.
<unk> percent <unk> was <unk> by their own.
We're <unk> at eight <unk> and found two <unk> of death and we found two natural death and when we <unk> to know, they <unk> that one of them was <unk> <unk>, and then <unk> it <unk> it. And then, they <unk> it.
The <unk> were able to recognize the animal <unk> that we can recognize the animal <unk>.
<unk> years early '<unk>, I was <unk> a very interesting task when my <unk> <unk> <unk> me, if I wanted to go to <unk> <unk> <unk>, and I wanted to <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and I used a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
To give a sense to <unk>, I should understand <unk> culture and the <unk> is not <unk> <unk>.
It's quite a <unk> <unk> vision of the world.
Very interesting.
If you ask to <unk> the great <unk> of the world, what do you feel?
<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, etc.
A continent comes out, thinking that Africa has not <unk> <unk>. And instead of <unk> and <unk> is not the <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
What makes interesting is the <unk> <unk> is the <unk> relationship between life and death.
So <unk> <unk> do <unk>.
<unk> can be <unk> by <unk> <unk>, <unk> to the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> to the <unk> in the <unk> <unk>, so that for a short moment, it becomes <unk> the <unk>.
So, for this <unk> <unk>, "<unk> <unk> go to <unk> to talk about God.
We <unk> in <unk> and <unk> God. "
And from the moment that you're <unk>, is the spirit that you <unk> you can make you bad?
So it <unk> to these incredible events: <unk> <unk> <unk> in the state of <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
I <unk> all the <unk> that I lived the most <unk> are the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, in <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that once <unk> on the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk>.
In a <unk> continent of blood, this <unk> never <unk> by <unk>.
In <unk>, I'm <unk> by a <unk>, but they <unk> <unk>.
The young <unk> are <unk> away from <unk> to three or four years, and live in a world <unk> in a <unk> <unk> world in <unk> <unk> <unk> for 18 years.
Two <unk> years of nine years <unk> <unk> that <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
For all this time, they're <unk> to the values of their <unk>, values that their <unk> and only <unk> their <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or to say <unk> <unk>.
Al <unk>'s <unk>, they're <unk> <unk> out and for the first time in their lives, at the age of 18, see a <unk>. And in that moment of <unk> of <unk> <unk>, everything that they have learned in <unk> theory, everything that they have learned in the <unk> theory, everything that they've learned in the <unk> theory, everything that they have learned in the <unk> theory, and it's <unk>.
"<unk>? <unk>, I said," <unk>.
It's <unk>. Now it's going to be <unk>. "
They call <unk> <unk> and more people say that we, <unk> <unk>, we are the <unk> of the world.
This is an <unk> level is extremely important.
When we think about <unk> <unk> and the <unk> environment, and the old story of the <unk> <unk>, which is a <unk> concept in his <unk> or maybe <unk> <unk> and <unk> that these are <unk> <unk> to the Earth.
<unk> <unk> are not <unk> or <unk> from <unk>.
There is no space for these things in the <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk>, but because of time and <unk>, have created a <unk> of Earth <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, but on a <unk> <unk> <unk>, the concept that the Earth can only live because it is <unk> by human <unk>.
What does it mean?
It means that a <unk> <unk> <unk> that the mountain is a <unk> spirit that <unk> is a <unk> spirit that <unk> its <unk> will be <unk> <unk> different and will have a <unk> different human being <unk> <unk> that a mountain or that <unk> <unk> that a mountain of <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> that a mountain <unk> <unk> that a mountain <unk> <unk> to be <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> is <unk>.
What's interesting is the <unk> that <unk> the relationship between <unk> and natural world.
I grew up in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that the <unk> <unk> to be <unk>.
And that made me a human being different from my friends who believe that <unk> are <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> that live in the <unk> <unk>, <unk> that <unk> in the <unk> <unk>.
If we start to <unk> that these <unk> can actually create different, we can actually start understanding some of their <unk> <unk>. They can be <unk> this <unk>.
I <unk> this picture at <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Maybe some of you have heard about <unk> <unk>, the most powerful <unk> <unk> <unk>.
What makes the <unk> is not the potential of <unk>, but its <unk>. It's <unk> by two elements.
On one side, this <unk> <unk> <unk> a series of <unk>, <unk> and <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
<unk> the only <unk> <unk> a <unk> that <unk> a little bit, but it's <unk> with the <unk> of a <unk> <unk>'s family <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This <unk> <unk> <unk>, very similar to <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
If you're going to see the <unk> <unk> on the <unk>, the <unk> that make a different <unk> of species, <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> that <unk> on the <unk> is a little bit like being <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a sea of electricity. [<unk>] [<unk>].] It doesn't make a <unk> of reality.
I often <unk> with my <unk>, Richard <unk> <unk>, the man who <unk> the <unk> was <unk>, with his discovery of <unk> <unk> in the <unk>.
And my <unk> can't be <unk> as a <unk>, because if you're <unk>, you can't tell anybody to be <unk>. [<unk>] [<unk>], but they can't be <unk> because they're <unk> by a <unk> that's of course, in <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
It's possible to <unk> only <unk> if you <unk> with other <unk> <unk> that <unk> the <unk>.
Now, the <unk> is the <unk> that are in this <unk> are <unk> <unk>, the same <unk> to <unk> the <unk>. The question <unk> <unk>: the <unk> <unk>. <unk> <unk>: in a <unk> <unk> species of plants, how these <unk> are <unk> to <unk> two <unk>, not like that if you <unk> in this way, they make a <unk> version of the <unk> of the <unk>?
We use the great <unk> of <unk> and <unk>, that can <unk> <unk>.
But if you <unk> to the <unk>, we <unk> "<unk>" plants. "
What does it mean?
This <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, who <unk> <unk> in the forest, and that <unk> <unk> in the forest species.
If <unk> how they <unk> their <unk> <unk> <unk> us, "<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, the rest of plants, you don't know everything?" I said, "No."
The solution is: you take the <unk> <unk> in a night night of the moon and <unk> <unk> with a different <unk>.
So, you don't get <unk>, but it's much more interesting than <unk> <unk>.
Now, [[[<unk>] the problem is that the people who have heart <unk> <unk> <unk> them are <unk>, but somehow <unk> to <unk> the <unk> of history than our real world, and it <unk>.
In fact, the <unk> century, in the 300 years, <unk> <unk>, not <unk> <unk> <unk>, but rather like the <unk> was that we <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> the mass of diversity and <unk> and <unk> <unk> on the planet. Now the problem is not the change.
All the <unk> through the <unk> have been <unk> in a <unk> for new possibilities of life.
And the problem is not technology.
<unk> <unk> have no <unk> to be <unk> when they put <unk> <unk> and <unk> so much as the <unk> have not <unk> to be <unk> when they put up <unk> and <unk>.
It's not the change or technology that <unk> the <unk> of <unk>. It's the power.
The <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And if you look at a look at the world, I'm not <unk> <unk> to <unk>.
They're <unk> and <unk> <unk> out of the <unk> forces that are beyond their <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> that <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> --
a <unk> <unk> <unk>, a <unk> <unk> <unk>, a <unk> that has been <unk> in the forest to a generation ago, and now <unk> to <unk> <unk> and <unk> to <unk> on the <unk> <unk>, where you can see the <unk> from the <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>,
We're going to <unk> the <unk> with the forest <unk>.
Or, in <unk> case, they're disease that are <unk> with the <unk> discovery.
If you <unk> on the <unk> <unk>, where I'm doing a lot of research, you'll see the <unk> <unk> of politics.
As a <unk> <unk>, the physical <unk> of a <unk>, is <unk> <unk> at <unk>, but <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, not only is is <unk>, but <unk> <unk> <unk> in certain <unk>, because it's part of the development of development.
And you can't understand the <unk> of <unk> until you're part of the <unk>.
I <unk> <unk> miles from <unk> in the Western China through the <unk> <unk>, <unk> to <unk> with a young <unk>, but only got to <unk> what's behind <unk>. I realized what's behind the <unk> that I'm going to talk about.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> million people <unk> from the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk>.
The father of this guy was <unk> to the <unk> <unk>.
The one that means that it was <unk> to the Chinese days of the Chinese.
<unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk> during the <unk> that led to <unk> <unk>.
My mother was <unk> and his <unk> was to be <unk>.
It was taken to <unk> in <unk> at age two <unk> under his <unk> because he could not have <unk> without him.
The <unk>, who did the same, was <unk> in <unk> <unk>.
One day <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> and, for this <unk>, was <unk> to <unk> <unk> for seven years.
The <unk> <unk> can be <unk>, but the <unk> spirit of <unk> is from <unk> present.
And then, everything <unk> <unk> to a choice.
<unk> live in the <unk> world of <unk> or we want to <unk> the <unk> world of diversity?
The great <unk> <unk> <unk>, before he died said that his greatest fear was that, in our <unk> to go to this <unk> <unk> view of the world, not only <unk> the whole <unk> of human imagination to a <unk> <unk> <unk> that there were other possibilities.
And it's <unk> to remember that our species is <unk> for <unk> years.
The <unk> <unk>, who gave us agriculture, which has made us, which <unk> us to <unk> <unk>, <unk> the <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk>, creating the <unk> of <unk>, and we're talking about <unk> years ago.
The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
That <unk> story, I didn't know, I'm going to <unk> all the challenges that I could <unk> in <unk>.
When we're <unk> to <unk> the world's what it means to be human, <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And it's in these answers that we all <unk> the chance of being what we are, a species that has to be, a <unk> species that has to <unk> and all the <unk> can <unk>. And there are great times.
I <unk> this picture on the north of <unk> <unk>, when I went to <unk> <unk> with <unk>, and this man, <unk> me <unk>, and this man, <unk> me the wonderful story of his <unk>.
The <unk> government has not always been <unk> with the <unk> <unk> and in the '<unk> to <unk> our <unk>, we <unk> them in <unk>.
The <unk> of this man <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The family, <unk> for his life, <unk> <unk> all the <unk>, and all his <unk>.
You should know that <unk> doesn't <unk> the cold, the <unk>.
The <unk> of <unk> in <unk> were made of fish <unk> in the skin of <unk>.
The <unk> of this man didn't <unk> from night or from the <unk> that <unk>.
It's <unk> away, it <unk> the <unk> in the skin of <unk> and <unk> in your hand. When I did it <unk> it, he <unk> it <unk> it by <unk>, he <unk> it by <unk> it by <unk>.
He <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk> <unk> and when <unk> <unk>, he <unk> a dog.
He <unk> the dog and created a <unk>, with the <unk> <unk> created a <unk>, and it's <unk> on the <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> to talk about <unk> with anything? [And this, this one, in different ways, [is the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all the <unk> <unk> of the world.
<unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> government <unk> to <unk> the total <unk> of an area of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> together.
It's their new <unk>. It's called <unk>.
It's a <unk> <unk>. It <unk> all the resources.
One <unk> example of how a <unk> can <unk> with his <unk>.
And, finally, I think it's quite <unk> at least at least at the people who have been in these <unk> areas of the planet, <unk> that they're not <unk> at all.
For somebody is home.
<unk> <unk> <unk> of human imagination, which <unk> to <unk> <unk>. And for us all, the dreams of these children, like our children of <unk> become part of hope.
To end, we <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> never <unk> to anything.
<unk> that <unk> --
[<unk>] they're not <unk>, but we believe that stories can change the world, and maybe we are the best <unk> to tell the stories of the world. Every month our site <unk> <unk> million <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> our <unk> <unk>.
Our <unk> are <unk> by millions of people.
Our work is <unk> in <unk> to bring our audience to our audience in places that <unk> <unk> from which <unk> <unk> from which <unk> <unk> from which <unk> <unk>, and they <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and we have to find a <unk> <unk> in a <unk> world and <unk> <unk>. We need to find a <unk> <unk> <unk>, and we have to find a <unk> <unk> world
where the <unk> of all the <unk> can <unk> to our <unk> <unk>.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you about some things that I'm going to <unk> you've heard and <unk> to <unk> some <unk>, in case, you don't <unk> them.
I want to start with what I call "the <unk> <unk>."
The <unk> <unk> of what?
The <unk> <unk> of all the <unk> society. The <unk> <unk> <unk>: "If we want to <unk> the <unk> of our citizens" The way to do that is <unk> the <unk> <unk>. "
The reason is, on a side, in fact that the freedom is <unk>, is <unk>, <unk>, <unk> for humans.
<unk> else is in fact that if we are <unk>, each of us can act to be <unk> to do everything that we <unk> our <unk>, without any one that we're going to be in our own.
The way to <unk> the freedom is to <unk> the choice.
More choices people have, more <unk> are <unk>, and more their <unk>, the <unk> is their <unk>.
This is <unk> <unk> in the society that nobody <unk> to <unk> in <unk>.
And it's also <unk> <unk> in our lives.
I'm going to show you some examples of what progress made possible.
This is my <unk>. It's not particularly big.
I <unk> a simple note about <unk> <unk>.
In my <unk>, there are <unk> <unk>, without <unk> the 10 <unk> <unk> <unk> that nobody of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> that nobody of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> that nobody of <unk> <unk> in your <unk> that nobody of <unk> <unk> <unk> is to your <unk>.
That's what <unk> is.
Then you go to the <unk> store to buy a <unk>: <unk>, radio, radio <unk>, <unk>, radio, <unk>.
And in this <unk> store, there's a big number of <unk> <unk>.
We can do six and a half million different <unk> using the <unk> that there are only a store.
<unk> <unk> that there is <unk>.
<unk> fields: the world of <unk>.
Once I was a child, you could get all the services <unk> <unk>, to <unk> that were <unk> by <unk> <unk>.
You <unk> the phone, you're not <unk>.
One <unk> of that, one of that, was that the phone <unk> <unk>.
These days, they went.
We now have a <unk> almost <unk> <unk>, especially between phones phones.
Here's the cell phones.
My <unk> is in the middle, <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk>.
If you're not <unk> you still saw in the <unk> <unk>, you're going to be <unk>.
And what happens to the end is that people <unk> <unk> in <unk> and it does this question. And you know, <unk> is the answer? The answer is, "No."
It's not possible to buy a cell cell phone that doesn't make things.
So, in other things about life that are much more important than <unk>, <unk> the same <unk> of choices.
<unk> <unk>: It doesn't happen in the United States that you're going to be <unk> and the <unk> you're going to be doing.
Instead, you go from <unk>, and the <unk> says, "OK, we could do it. Or you can do it." Or, you know, "A," has these <unk>, "<unk> has these <unk> and these <unk>. What do you want to do?"
You <unk> them, "<unk>, what do you want to do?"
And the <unk> says, "<unk> has these <unk> and these <unk>, and <unk> <unk> these <unk> and these <unk>."
"What do you want to do?"
And you say, "<unk> if she was me, what would you say?"
And the <unk>, "But I'm not her."
The result we call "<unk> <unk> <unk>," <unk> <unk>, "<unk> that makes it look like a beautiful thing.
But in fact, it's not that a <unk> <unk>, and the weight of making a <unk> that's something, <unk> the <unk>, to <unk> something that doesn't know anything -- and it's certainly <unk> -- and it's not <unk> to make the patient.
There's a huge <unk> of <unk> <unk>, <unk> to people like me and you, that if you think about it has no sense, because we can't <unk>.
But if we can't <unk>, why do we <unk> them?
The answer is that they want to <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> so fundamental as it is our <unk> now is a question of choice, how you see in this <unk>. "We don't want to <unk> the children. We don't want to <unk> the <unk>." We're not going to be a <unk>.
And we can <unk> how many times we <unk>.
The <unk> means that every <unk>, <unk> <unk>, you have to decide that kind of person you want to be.
We go to the family and <unk>, a time perspective, <unk> the common perspective, almost anyone, was that there was that there was a <unk> to be <unk> as soon as possible.
The only real choice was with who, not when, and not even what to do after.
<unk>, everything is really to play.
They're going to be very smart, and they <unk> their 20 percent less than work than a time.
And not because they're <unk> less <unk>, not because they're less <unk>.
but why are they <unk>, <unk> to <unk>, "<unk> <unk>, or not? <unk> it?"
"<unk> <unk> <unk> later? I have to think before the children or to career?"
I'm <unk> <unk>.
And they're trying to answer these questions, even if this <unk> doesn't <unk> the <unk> that <unk> and not get a <unk> <unk> to my <unk>.
And they really need to do that. They're important questions.
Now, the work is <unk>, as <unk> <unk>, because technology <unk> us to work every minute, every day, on the <unk> of the planet, <unk> that from <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, there's a <unk>, and I'm not going to say anybody, where the <unk> works.
I'm not telling you, because I want to use it.
What does, this incredible freedom to choice that we have about work? It's that we have to decide, <unk> at every moment, if we're going to work or not.
We can go to see our child, with the cell cell phone in a <unk>, the <unk> in a <unk>, the <unk>.
And even if I're all <unk>, every minute that we see our son, <unk> <unk> the <unk>, we're also <unk>, "<unk>," <unk>, "<unk>."
"I have to <unk> this <unk>? I have to <unk> this letter?"
And even when the answer is, "not," everything makes the experience of your child very different from what would would be in other conditions.
So, from any part of us, we look at small things, <unk> objects and <unk>, life is a question of choices.
Once the world was this: <unk>, there were some chance, but it wasn't a question of choice.
The world today's going to be <unk> to this: <unk> is, "It's a <unk> thing, or <unk>?"
The answer is <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> we know, so I'm going to talk about <unk> <unk>.
And I'm going to be <unk> this choice, two effects <unk> on people.
The first one, <unk>, is that <unk> <unk> instead of <unk>.
With a lot of <unk> between which <unk>, it becomes very difficult to do it.
I'll give you an <unk> example, a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
A <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, with about a million <unk> <unk> in <unk> companies.
What she found is that every 10 <unk> that are <unk> in more, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> two percent.
<unk> <unk> <unk>, there's 10 percent less than <unk> than <unk> <unk>, when they're only five five five five five to <unk>. Why?
Because with 50 <unk> between which <unk>, is it hard to decide, and the choice is <unk>.
And <unk>, and again, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and of course, <unk> never comes back.
<unk> that doesn't only mean that these <unk> <unk> <unk> food to <unk> because they're not going to have enough money, it means that the decision is so <unk> that it also <unk> the decision that <unk> the <unk> <unk>.
They're not going to be <unk> to five <unk> <unk> <unk> for year from <unk> <unk>, which would be <unk> to <unk>.
So <unk> is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> choices.
And I think it's going to be <unk> the world.
"And finally, to end the <unk>: <unk>, <unk> or <unk>?"
You could be <unk> the right decision, if it's for <unk>, isn't it?
You don't want to choose the wrong, and you <unk> the wrong <unk>.
So this is the first effect. The second is that even if we can <unk> <unk> and make a choice, we're less <unk> by the end of the result of how we <unk> <unk> <unk> with less <unk> between which <unk>.
And that's why we do.
One of them is that with a lot of <unk> between which, if you <unk> one and it's not perfect, it's easy to imagine that you could make a different choice that would be better. And what happens is that the <unk> <unk> <unk> us to <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk>, and the <unk> <unk> from the decision,
even when it was a <unk> decision.
More choices there are, <unk>, <unk> is <unk> than any <unk> that is <unk> <unk>.
<unk>, there is what <unk> call.
Dan <unk> has <unk> very well <unk> as the value that we give things to things from what we <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, when there are many <unk> possible, it's easy to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> to be less than <unk> <unk> <unk> that is choice.
Here's an example. I <unk> with all those who are not in New York.
But that's what you probably <unk>.
There's this <unk> to <unk>.
It's a place of <unk>.
<unk> <unk>. <unk> day. It's everything for them.
It's nothing <unk>. But what he thinks, "Well, <unk>, <unk>, is <unk>."
"All my <unk> <unk> are away."
"<unk> <unk> <unk> right in front of home."
And it's going to go from the idea that is <unk> -- every day -- the chance of <unk> where it wants.
The <unk> <unk> <unk> for what we have, even when the choice was <unk>.
And the more are the <unk> that we have <unk>, the <unk> <unk> us to <unk>.
Here's another example.
This <unk> tells us a lot of things.
It's about living time, and maybe the slowly of slowly.
But the most important thing is that anything you're going to be, you know, you're going to be <unk> to do other.
The things that they don't <unk> many <unk> that can make less <unk> what we do.
<unk> point: <unk> <unk> <unk>.
I tried to <unk> on my skin <unk> a new couple of <unk>.
It's going to be almost always <unk>.
Once the <unk> were just a <unk>, and they were <unk>, and they were <unk>, only after <unk> <unk> <unk> a life and <unk> a lot of times, we were going to go well.
So, I went to <unk> a new <unk> when the <unk> were gone, and I said, "I need a couple of <unk>, this is my <unk>."
The <unk> said to me, "Do you want to <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>?"
You want them to <unk> or <unk>? "<unk>" or "<unk>" <unk> "or" <unk>?
"Do you want to <unk>?"
"<unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk>? <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> --" <unk> to <unk>.
I was <unk>, and after a little bit I could say, "I want the guy who was," I want the only guy that was, and so for a moment, I <unk> all the <unk> <unk> <unk>, and then <unk> out of the <unk> <unk>, and then <unk> out of the <unk> store, and I had a <unk> store, and I had ever had.
It was <unk>. With all that choice I had <unk> the best.
But I'm going to tell me about it.
Why? I have I wrote a whole book for <unk>.
The reason I was was worse, that with all that choice my <unk> were <unk>, the <unk> <unk> to be <unk>.
At the beginning I had <unk> <unk>. I didn't know anything about <unk> when I only one guy, but when I had to <unk> 100 different, <unk> at least one kind had to be perfect.
What I had <unk> was good, but not perfect.
After I <unk> that <unk> with what I was <unk> in <unk> to <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> in life of people don't make <unk> the <unk> that these are <unk> to <unk> <unk>.
And this <unk> <unk> <unk>, even when the results are good.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Because if I <unk> it, I'm not talking about.
The truth is more to this.
"It was better when you was worse," The reason why he was <unk> when you were worse is worse, when you were worse was <unk> as much worse as you could <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk>, in the world that we live in -- <unk>, <unk> citizens with the <unk> <unk> -- the <unk> that we can <unk> is that things are <unk> to <unk>.
You've never <unk> <unk> because your <unk>, my <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
The <unk> of happiness -- what you're here -- is, "<unk> <unk> <unk>," Yes, you want to do it. "
I mean -- little <unk> moment -- who are really <unk> and my wife is really <unk>.
I could not have done a better, I didn't have <unk>.
But <unk>, it doesn't always be a <unk> thing.
You know, a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> when there's just that kind of <unk> is that when you're not <unk>, and you're <unk>, and you're <unk>, "Why?"
"Who is <unk>?" The answer is <unk>.
The world is <unk>. What I could do?
When you have hundreds of <unk>, and you <unk> a <unk>, and you're going to <unk> a <unk>, and you know, you're <unk> <unk> that <unk> you are.
I could do better.
There are hundreds of <unk> available, there are no <unk> for <unk>.
So when people make decisions, even if the result is <unk>, you're <unk> <unk> and give them their <unk>.
In the last few years, the <unk> is <unk> in the <unk> world.
I think a <unk> <unk> -- not the only, but important -- of this <unk> <unk> is just that people have experiences because the standard are too <unk>.
And when they have to <unk> this situation think <unk> is they think that <unk> is they.
So the end result is that in general is that in general we're going to be worse.
Let me tell you.
This is the <unk> <unk>, what we're going to take for and it's completely <unk>.
There is no <unk> that a little bit of choice is better than <unk>, but from this is not a lot of choice is better than a little bit better than a little bit.
There's a <unk> value, <unk>. I don't know what it is.
But I'm sure that we <unk> from a piece of the level where the choices are <unk> our lives.
Now, from a <unk> <unk> -- I almost finished -- from a <unk> point of view, <unk> is <unk>.
What it allows all this choice in <unk> society is <unk> material.
There are many places in the world, and you know, you know, where the problem is not that they have <unk> choice.
The problem is that they have too <unk>.
So the <unk> I'm talking about is a <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> society.
And what <unk> does, and <unk> is this: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to you yesterday about how <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> to be <unk>. It's a <unk> <unk>.
I mean that these choices, <unk> and <unk>, it's not just <unk>.
I'm <unk> <unk>.
They're doing it worse.
If a little bit of what in our society <unk> <unk> choice was <unk> in those where people have too much a few possibilities, it would not only be their life to <unk>, but also our own.
This is what <unk> call.
A <unk> <unk> is good to all -- not only the poor -- because of this choice in <unk> that <unk> us.
To end, "<unk>, you can become everything you want to --
<unk>, people of culture, <unk>, "But what do you do do?"
"It's <unk> that you can't make anything in a glass <unk>."
"A <unk> <unk>, a <unk> view of the world --"
and I <unk> it so, I <unk> it.
But then, <unk>, I realized that that fish knows that that fish knows the long <unk>.
Because the reality of <unk> is that if you <unk> the <unk>, so that it's all possible to be <unk>, you can't <unk> the freedom. It <unk> the <unk>.
If you <unk> the <unk> so that it's <unk> that it's <unk> possible to <unk> <unk>.
<unk> the <unk>, and they <unk> <unk>.
They need a <unk>.
This is almost certainly too <unk>, maybe even for the fish, and certainly for us.
But the <unk> of some <unk> <unk> is a <unk> for <unk> and, <unk>, for <unk>.
Thank you very much.
