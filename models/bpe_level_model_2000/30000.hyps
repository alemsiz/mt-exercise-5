And the last year I showed these slide to demonstrate that the glacial calculation of the 48 dimensions of the 48 dimensions of the 48 States of the 48 percent.
But this is the gravity of the problem because it doesn't show the often.
The artype is artical climbing climate system, the heart heart of global climate system.
You expands of the summmer and the summer record.
The next slide will be a rapid rapid relief on the last 25 years.
The gacross the games are drawed in red red it.
As you see, you know, they expanding to the blue scred.
That's the glacium in the wind, which is the glacid.
You can see the glacious glacious glacious glacious glacious same, which is like smoke smoke out of the body.
In 25 years was going to spent like this.
This is a problem because the interests of the interests of the artic terrain where there are huge amount of carbon of carbon of carbon dibon and conged that sheets are transformed in meters and meters in meters and put in meters from the microbs.
Rispace to the totality of the inquink pollution, that amount of global warming, that quantity could be double, super-return this pollution.
In some laghi deep in Alaska little deep metan asic metan aques.
The professored professored Katey Walter of Alaska has been recated team in a team of the U.S.
Video: Wow! Al Gore: Wow! She's good.
A reason is that this exchange is that this termic surrises of the north.
This is a glacial recording to the glacial regim.
The levels had never reached levels.
This is the Kangerlusasic Kangerlusa-east Greenland.
If you want to know how the level of the level of the gain on level of level, here is where the sea.
These corrents are increasing rapidly.
Another part of the planet: Antarart, the biggest block of the planet.
The scientists have declared that the glacior is in the glacium, and that the Antarcts, which is particularly running on some island is particularly rapid in the sheet.

The environmental disasters are increasing a returns out of the normal and without precedented it.
Four times more numbers in the last 30 years of the previous price of 75.
This is a whole thing about insten.
If you look at it in the historical context if you can see the consequences.
In the last five years we added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the oceans every day.
Look at the English, from the oriental Pacific America, to obast the west, and on the west, where there is a radical radical of oxygen in the oceans.
Most of global warming, together with deforestation, and the deforestation, which is 20-percent, is the use of fossils.
oil is a problem, and the carbon is a problem, and the charcoal is even worse in the way.
The United States are one of the two countries with the more emissions, together to China.
And it proposed to build a lot of other carbon and maintain a lot of other carbon and the board.
But we're going to assisting change.
These are the annulled projects in the last years and some of green alternative projects
At anyway, there is a political lotate in our country.
The carbon and oil industries have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote the carbon and oxide of the carbon and oxide of the charcoal and oxium.
That image me something that reminded me to remind me
Natal, in Tennessee, where I live in Tennessee, where it was 3.8 billion gers of carbon dies of carbon dial carbon dish.
Maybe you saw it on the news.
This is the second biggest fleast float of scories.
It's happened around Natma.
The natalized publishing of the carbon industries was this one.
Video: Me: Frosty carbon is a basic and happy.
It's abundant here in America, and it makes our economy.
Frosty the carbon is increasingly clean.
It's precise price, and workers keep the style stick and workers keep the stypending.

This is a one of it.
Video: All right, "All Lery look at climate changes like a threat of mine climate to our business.
So our priority is invest a great amount of money in a public effort to make the audience and confuse the truth of the charcoal.
In fact, the carbon is not spor.
We think it is a good fumelt -- it has a good fum.
So not preocupated,
Let me do you go.
Video: All right, "Carbon -- you heard about a lot of talking about a lot of it.
So let's take a game structure in a structure of the charcoal for how it is a charcoal of clean.
Straordinary cars are a little roy! The machines are a little roy-technology sound of carbon technology.
carbon disease is between the main of global warming causes of global warming technology of carbon and clean technology of carbon that you can see change.
Do you look at the cheat: this is the technology of carbon technology.
Al Gore: Infinally, the alternative alternative questions and the national questions and to the national connect of national security.
Video: M: Like is in crisi; the economy, the national confident crisis, climate crisis.
The film that college all the way our dependence from the combustics and the oil dependent of the charcoal and oil is the important.
Now, there's a new new audful solution, audance solution for us.
Repower America: 100th of clean energy in 10 years.
They plan to put the America in work, to make sure and help them stop the global warming.
Finally, a solution that basts to solve our problems.
Repower America. Scopy more.
Al Gore: This is the ultimate one.
Video: Here is a relief of America.
One of the fastest ways to bring up the dependence from combustible combustic our planet.
I would go to the future is here. I think, a new network is here.

If you want to go away toge."
We have to go away at the fast.
Thank you very much.
The year last year, I was a introduction on LHC.
And I promise to go back to the back to how the car.
So I got it. And for those who the other time you weren't there was the biggest scientific experimented in the audience never told -- 27 kilometers of circumsters of circumstom.
His comfortable to reach the conditions that were less than a billion of a second billion second from the beginning of the universe -- until 600 million times a second.
And this is just the clever.
This is the underneath Gineva.
We photographer these mini-Big Bang in the relievators.
This is what I work. It's called ATLAS -- it's a 4meters and has a 22 feet and has a 22 meters of 2-meters.
This is a image image of ATLAS in building so you can notice proportions.
The 10 sectors of the last year we have the car for the first time,
And this picture was taken by AS.
It was unseen fest-festating festating in the control.
It's a picture of the first phase, which was all around the LHC, and he had all the boyers of LHC, and delibered with a side of LHC, and spread particles within the LHC, and spread particles within the relief of the first of the relilight in the collision,
In other words, when we saw that the 10 set, we understand the machine work, we understand the machine work, which is a great liftyle of life.
I don't know if it was to do it more opposed to do this when someone on Google and saw that the beginning was thise.
That means we had a cultural impact beyond the scientific impact.
About a week, there was a problem with the machine, had to these files here -- these files here -- these files here -- these files here -- these files -- these files -- these files.
These files take 13,000 print when the machine works when the machines works in the massive power.
Now, the technicians between you look at files and say, "It's not true. I'm files too much under thin the thin of you.
And instead of they can do it because when they're very cosidy become cosid-superconvictors.
So, at least 271 degrees, at a point of the space between the stars, these files can bring that corrupt in the spaces can bring that corring.
In one of the most of the most of the magnets in the LHC, there was a fabrication.
So the files are surrise to the read and 13,000 printing and 13,000 printing suddenly met resistance.
This was the result.
Now, this is even more impression, if you think these magnets are about 20 tons than 30 centimeters and that have been placed about 30 centimeters.
They are damaged about 50 magnets.
We had to take it out, what we had to do it.
We have them and add and add them up.
They're now going back to the ground underground.
Englise the end of the LHC is is going to be new integral of new integraph.
We let me go and look at the right of the data or light data to go and continue so our adventure adventure of the wind burch to find what the universe.
Now, of course, in a certain amount of it, these crashed the dibate and engineering. It's easy to conceive in frontiers. It's easy to be to confuture.
I think the fact that it's so difficult to go beyond the limits, I think this is the value of things like LHC.
I would like to end up with the words of a Ingless, Humphrey Davy, what, Humphrey Davy, who image, in defense of its pupllo was Michael Faray, said, "No Michael Faray, said, "No much dangerous for the progress of the human mind that are define as a degress of the human minds, which we don't have any new money, and not us knowlededge, and not us."
Thank you.
I want to start asking you to rethink about this and a kids, and played with a kids, and played cooks.
As you figure them and reach them and reach them and relief them and move them and resolve them and resolve problems and resolve problems and eat thinking about spaces.
The space reason is deeply connected to the way we understand most of the world around us.
So, from information information inspired by using our interaction with physical objects in my consultent and my collaborator Jeevan Kalaniths, I started asking myself, "And if we use a computer, instead of having the charge of the mouse of the policy as a gital path that moves on a name of information with both ent, demust deal with both information with both information with both information with both charge and man,
and we make it in our please?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer to the answer to the answer Siftable.
In poors of word, a Siftable computer is a big interactive computer interactive as a bird pattern.
In poors of word, a Siftable computer is a big interactive computer interactive as a bird pattern.
You can move them with the hand, they can see it move in them, and they have a wireless radio and a wireless.
But absolutely the physical objects, as the morning, you can simply relight.
The Siftable are the example of a new ecosystem of instruments for digital information.
And as they become more physical and more physical across their own movement, and as they become more physical consciouss, and the other, of the others, as we can explore and exploring new stily and fun the interactions of interaction.
I will start with some simple example.
This Siftable is configed to show video -- if you include it in a direction, the video will go back to the other side of the other side back.
These are the interactive ritical ritriticians are aware of others.
If they are doing it, you interested in what they are going around it.
If they are surround, they can agitate a bunch of it.
If they are surround, they can agitate a bunch of it.
They also have their movement and incline.
We realized that one of the interesting interesting of the interaction was the power to use gestures on the data, "example, a liquid.
In this case, we have three Siftable configurated secks of green-green-secks in the central central where they mix on the central where they mix of the color.
and I can use them to use them to the color in the central central where they mix of the color.
If we can do it a little bit about it.
There's also beautiful chance of learn, as languages, the mathematics and games where people can try and try and see the logical things quickly, and see the immediately and see the immediately.
Now I'm going to --
This is a Fibonacus, and I do with a program of equations.
We have a words of words that is half between Schabeo and Boggle.
First, to every turn and you get a house on every Siftable, Pratically, to every turn in the Siftable, and the side of Siftable, and as you certain coming control words a ditionary.
Then, after about 30 seconds remissing and you have a new set of lects, and new possibility to try to try to get to try to do.
Thank you.
Here's a children came to Media Lab, I did it so that they tried them and I turned a video.
They have a lot of them are please.
And one of the interesting things about this kind of application is you don't have to give people a lot of education.
You just have to say, "Looks of words, and they know what to do.
Here's other people who try to do it.
This is our young more girl, there in the right.
It was just going to get it.
They just were getting to him.
Now, this is a application of a interactive cards.
We wanted to build a tool for the apprentices of Lui is Felix.
It can inserve new characters in the scene, and swing the Siftable and associated associated with them.
It can inserve new characters in the scene, and swing the Siftable and associated associated with them.
And it's doing the sun.
Video: The sun.
David Merrill: Well it left a treat in the scen.
Video: The aran.
Bel work!
So I get to school and put them close to the neighbors can interact the characters --
Video: Bau!
-- by inventing their story.
Video: Cia!
DM: It's a story with the open-open and it can decide how you do it.
DM: It's a story with the open-open and it can decide how you do it.
Video: Vole, I love.
DM: The last example I have time to show you is a tool, realized recently to be a recently realized and execk music.
it's a tool, realized recently, to the recently and execk and music.
The Sife of the sky is based on sound like and batteria.
Every one of these has four different variations, and you can choose what to use to use it.
You can get these sound sound of these sound sound to the floor of the please.
And it simply it to just touch a sound "so" and a "sequenc."
These are effects that you can control from living, as the film and the filter.
Lake a particular and then include and then include to add it.
And then there are the general effects as time and volumes, which is apply in the sequence.
Let's look at how it works.
Video: DM: We will start a basic in two Sift" sequence, we system, we will add the extend to be add to the extended asic thing, we add other base.
Now I put a basse.
Video: DM: Oh you add percent --
Video: DM: And I'm going to put the bacteria, so I can control the effect of live.
Video: DM: Do fast, I can fast the entire sequence in the time to the side of the other.
Video: DM: And I'm going to add the basic to give more expression.
Video: DM: Do I can recombine the sequence of the volo."
So I don't have to planning it before, but I can improvise it to make it longer or more corty.
And now, finally, I can get the whole sequence fire out the whole sequence of the volume."
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is build new interfaces of man-machine interfaces like our brain and body.
And I have time to show you one of the results of the results of this paper, and some possibilities that we try to bring out of the lab.
The concept I want to transmit you to be going to be coming this new generation of objects to interact with digital media in way we want to do information in our world that we want.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the hour of talking to everybody.
They're a writing writing.
She is my professional books is my professional and it's more than that, obviously.
It's also the love and the fash.
And I don't aspect that it can change it.
But, you know, something particularly happened in my life and career, and my career, which left me to realibrate the whole relative relative to me to work with this work.
The particularly thing is I recently written this book, this biography called "Mangia, Ama" -- and whatever since my libris, for some reason for some reason for some reason in the world and became a big sensational, bestseller interational sensational.
And the result is everywhere you go to the people that are treating me as if I convicted me as if I convicted to me.
But, convict!
They are all worried and they all worried and they say, "You don't afraid to be able to do better?
Don't afraid to continue to write all the life without any longer to create a book that can be able to make someone who can matter somebody to matter somebody to do you know?"
which can be to matter someone who can me?"
It's remaining ranging -- you know.
But it could go worse in the worse I remember more than 20 years ago, when I started to say to people -- I was a telling -- I wanted to be a trick -- I wanted to be a write write --
I met against the same reaction statement.
And people said, "Don't you any time to be success?
Don't afraid to kill you kill?
You don't fear of doing this mestive to do this mestive life without anything to come up and die on a heart of burning of seven with the mouth of falliment?"
So, you know.
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is, "Y."
I fear of all those things.
I always had to fear that I had to fear
And I also fear of many other things that people may not have to ine.
As the algaa and other things like that.
But, as I think about the writing what I thought and ask me ultimate is why is?
Is it ration?
It's logical to be expect to be scared by a work that you feel that you feel to do it.
But what is so particularly in the impted creative to make us live to the mind of the mind of the mental health of not doing it?
How my father, for example, he was a chemical engineer and I don't remember one time in his 40 years of activity where he was asked to be afraid to be engineer engineer to be engineer engineer to be engineer engineer capit?
There was no -- that it was there -- that block John, how do you do that?
Don't work?
Enestly, the engineers don't have certainly in the centuries, they didn't certainly have a reputation of being highly elized maniaged to relive maniaged in the realitcogners have no certainly clust.
We writers -- we have enough this reputation, and not only writers and not just growriters of all generes, we have this reputation of being enormously instable.
And it's not really, the other thing that look at the contains of the magnific deaths that only in the 2th century, they die and often young people and often for them.
And the ones you don't have suicide seem to be really disfacts that they really like to be disdded by their women.
Norman Mailer, before we die, in the last he said, "My my book, my book killed a little bit of a little bit of a little more." One extraordinary result about their life.
But we don't have the way to say why we have these things that we heard these so long-that somehow we have interior that creativity and accepted the notion and the suffering that the creativity and the art, and the art, the finally, wealth, it will always be a golden to the anguguy in the angoods.
And the question I want to ask everybody is going to take this idea?
It goes you go to this thing -- because it looks like me to be a centimeter of me is not good for anything about this supposed various supposed to do anything about it.
I think it's hodiose.
And I think it's also dangerous and I don't want to see perpetuated in the next century.
I think it's better encouraging our big minds to live.
And I know that in my case -- in my case -- it would be very dangerous to become out to the dark of supposed to be a degree of supposed to be in my career.
Obly -- I mean now, I'm quite young in a young --
I still have about four decades in me.
And it's very likely to be writing what I writing about the world as the work that was going to be right from the work that used to be used to be a good book.
I'm going to be slaved to be slaver here -- it's likely my biggest success is to my greatest success is to my shares.
Oh, Gesus, who think!
You know, this is the kind of thinking about the thinking of a person starting to bed up to the morning, and I don't want to do it.
I would continue to do this work that I love to do this work that I love it.
So, the question becomes do?
And so I seed it after a lot of reflections, which the way to work to continue to get to to create a psychological construction of protective psychology, OK?
I have to find a kind of security of security between me, which I am writing and my natural reaction of which is going to write E, as I was trying to get E, as I was trying to get out through the time to look through the time through the time, trying to find other societies to see if they could have more ideas to see if they could have the best ideas to see if they could have the best ideas to see if they were able to have the best ideas to see if they were the best ideas to see if they were to be able to get the best ideas to get the ballower
how to help people to manage creative people to manage emotional risks of creativity.
And that researching me to the ancient Grecia and Roma.
Seguitless because it turns back and then back back back back and then back back back back and then back back back in the circle and then back back back to the circle and then back back back to the circle and then it comes back to the circle and then it comes back to certain the way.
In the ancient Grecia and ancient Rome -- people didn't seem to believe the creativity came from humans, OK?
And it was thinking that creativity was this is about divine and he came to men from a few surface and unknown and unknown for distant reasons and unknowknown.
The Greeks called these demons' creativity of creativity of creativity
Socrate, wonderful, he believed to have a demon that elargies from away.
The Roms were of the same idea, but they call the spirit without a genius.
which is great, because Roms didn't think that a genius was somebody particularly smart.
They believed a genius was this kind of dived entity that you believed in the walls of the study of a study artist, a little bit like Dobby, and that was a little bit like Dobby, and modeling the artist of the artist of the argument and modeling the result of that work.
Excitional -- this is the distance of which I -- that construct psychological construction that you protect you from your work.
And everybody knew that was so that he worked, right?
So the ancient artists were protected by certain things, like the too the too narcism, right?
If your work was exceptional not to take all the market, everybody knew that you had been helped by this genius to help from this genius to have a genius.
If your work is not all your falitia, it was not a whole bunch of your job.
They all knew that was your genius to be a unable unability.
And so people have conceived the creativity in Ocdent for a long time.
Then the Rinascise came and all changed and changed this big idea; we put the human being; we put the human beings and mysters and mysters and and no longer leaving and mysters writing the creatures of details that details from divinity.
This was the principle of the rational experience and people started thinking that creativity came completely from ishing iared.
And for the first time in history, you begin to refering this or arrun as a kind of a genius.
And I have to tell you, I think it was a big error.
I think that allow someone simple to believe that it is like a recipe of being like the sources of all misters and the surgery of all my own wines, unknowledge and etheternal responsibility to be a film to be a film that huge to human fragile fragile fragile of the human fragile fragile of the phrgile and ethese,
It's like to ask someone of ingoid to someone to get the sun.
Deform and historically, the ego and creates all these ingestible expectations on performance.
And I think it was this pression to destroy the artists in the pasts in the pasts of the past.
And if this is true, and I think it is, the question becomes and now?
We can do it different?
Maybe you can go back to a more ancient understanding of the relationship between human and creative and creative creative.
Or maybe no.
Maybe we can't make 500 years of rational thinking about a 18 minutes in a 18 minutes.
And probably there is people in the audience that would be suspects on the notion that they follow the notion of the notion that they follow people are going to follow their projects.
I'm going to convince you all about this stuff.
But the question I would like to ask is -- why is that?
Why don't think it in this way?
Because it has more sense than anything that ever ever heard to explain the exasperant impredictable.
A process that has ever ever tried to do something -- so that you ever ever ever tried to do something -- you know, you don't behavior.
And in fact, it can be completely paranormal paranormal paranormal paranormal seems completely paranorm.
I did this met recently with the extraordinary poet. Ruth Stone, which has 90 years old, but it was a poet, and he told me that during his own infancial infancially Virginia, working out of the realities out in the field, and I was going to be when a poem poet.
He told me that it was like a frage frage of the air.
And he came roll to the landscape.
He heard to come to the land and he had to get the earth underlying the land under.
He knew to have a only thing to do to that point and it was saying "to run how a morning, "round to run as a morn."
And so it comes to home and came up and came to follow from this poetisoned by this poety-scaled paper and a pretty fastic enough in the past, and a pretty much fast, and it will tell it on the page.
Other volved in the time, and he couldn't be quicked, and it was running and record and record without able to get in home and poetry the rolled and she would continued through the lands and she's going to go through the landscape, and he would go through the land, "See a poet.
Then there were the time -- this piece of the time I don't forget -- there were the time in which was almost lost, OK?
So, he was running to the home and he was trying to paper, and he was trying to take a paper on the walking and said, he was a matheme in the time he was like it was like if you gave it with the other hand and the eat and the tip and the effort.
And he was going to get the poem from the code and reputed it in his body and turned it on the page.
And in these cases, the poem would be presented on perfect and intact page and intact page to the first time.
So when I felt it -- it's crazy exactly the same equal process.
Not all my creative process -- I'm not a convict!
I'm a mule, and my way to work is she's-wake up and souling every day and work and work and go over and spend it up.
But even in my hey, I was in my sheet, I went up against that thing, sometimes you.
And I image a lot of you have a lot of you have it.
You know, if the work and ideas and ideas and ideas they would be able to know.
And what is this thing?
And how can we relate to the head, but it doesn't have the head, rather tex, raining us to stop healthy hood?
And as I think about it is the best example I have is Tom I have a Tom Musician I interview that I interview in a day.
We were talking about that, and you know, Tom, and you know, Tom, for the majority of life was the artist of the artist of the argument, trying to control, and trying to control these species of creative creative impulses these creative impulses that interior.
But then he was a little bit about it, and a day and a day day when he was driving on a Los Angeles, changed all over him.
He was going to fast, and all of a charge track of this melodia, which comes in his head as the inspiration, elusive and elusive and athetic ask, you know, it's wonderful, and you know, it's wonderful, but not how to take it.
It has no piece of paper, it doesn't have a matheme recorator.
So it starts to feel this kind of old old old old old old that the type, and I can bring obsessed by this song persemble.
I'm not good enough enough and I can't do it."
And instead of going to stop in the panic stoppanic him.
And I will go the whole process and he did something completely new thing.
And he just looked at the sky and said, "Scuse, you can't see I'm driving it?"
"To seems to write a song hor?
If you really want to exist, you go back to a more opportunity when I can take care of you.
One of triments, you go to someone else else now.
You go to disturbing Leonard Cohen."
And his working process changed after this.
Not the work, the work was still dark like it seed.
But the process, and the fish anks that would be released when the genius was released when the genius that would be a little bit of him, and libered it realizing it from where it was a whole thing to come from, and realize that it was a whole thing to be a whole thing and returned back to the mind.
but it was a conversation of bizarre conversation between Tom and a conversation between Tom and this strange thing that he was not Tom.
So I felt that story about changing a little bit about changing the way I worked and saved me a time.
This idea, saved when I was writing "Mangia, Ama," and he falls from one of those cleverage of the disperation where we are working on something and we can't work on something and we can start thinking about something and we can start to think that will be a worst book that will be the worst write.
Not just bad the worst written writting.
And I started to think about design.
But then I remember Tom who talked to about the air and tried us.
So I went to my face on the hand-right right and I would say my comments to a corner of the room.
And I said, "Yes, both my own thing, and both what if this book is not going to be brilliant not be brilliant not be brilliant, right?
Because I can see what I am going to put all of this thing I haven't more about it.
So if you want to be better and you have to show you you and make your party.
Okay. But if you don't do it, I don't do anything.
I'm going to write the same because my work.
And I would like to do it was recorded to me that I have to be presented to me to do my particular te" -- the end is OK -- secovers in the deserts of the North people dances in the deserts for the dances and sacross the dancy and the hours that they were going to go to the high hours and the high-hours and the hours to the high fall.
And they were always magnants, because the ballers were professional and they were fantastic and they were fantastic and they were fantast.
But every tun, rary, it was going to be a reality of these artists became to translent reality.
And I know what you talk, because I know that you have all the way you all have a point, a lot.
It was as the time stopped and the walking walking through a sort of lands and weren't doing anything about different from usual and it was not doing anything about 1,000 night, but everything else on the squarter.
And suddenly not just as a human being.
But you accepted from the below and from the underground of divinity.
And when this happened to the time, the people knew what he was called her named him on his name.
They were going to sing hands and started to singing, "Ah, Allah Doh Doe, God."
That's God, you know.
The note note -- when the Morors the south of South nails the south of Spain, and they preserve this changed in the century changed in the centuries of "Ah, Allah, Allah h Allah" to "Oh, Allah the float.
In Spana, when a artist made something impossible and magic -- "Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, and incommands, and involved -- a short of God.
And it's great because we have to do.
But, the problem comes the day down, when you wake up and discovers that are 11 morning to the morning of Martedday and found it in God morning, and the last of God is not more.
It's just a mortal death, with the knews and maybe it never be able to achieve that height to that height in that sheet.
And maybe no one canor the name of God while it's still going to do with his life?
It's hard to hard it.
This is one of the most pain in a creative lifestyle to make a creative life.
But maybe it doesn't have to be so anguy if you can not believe it, you know, the most amazing expects of your being come from you to yourself in your being from you to yourself to yourself as you are.
But it just believed you get from a instances from a inimaginable sources of this team of your life that you have to spend someone else when you finished.
And, you know, if we think in this whole change.
And so I started thinking about it, and it's surely as I thought about a different months during the work of book that I'm going to public book that I'm going to be a dangerous -- and I was followed about my big next thing happen.
And what I have to continue when I feel electric when I feel electric feeling --
Don't walking the work.
He talks to you to the argue for your party, whatever you can be.
If your work is ball, dance, ball.
If the divine, you know, you assumption to leave some kind of wonderful to leave some kind of wonderful time through your effort in your efforts through your effort at the time, "Ole!"
Or triments, you do the same tube.
And "Ole!" to yourself.
I think you know, I think it would be to teach it.
"Ole!" to you, even for you, just for a human text and text tboard to get you to get you to get continuously to get you to the continuously.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
As you know I've talked about some of these projects on human genome, on what it can meaning and discovering new set of genes.
Now we're starting a new lot, we started to digitalize biology and now start to digitalize biology and now now we are running in a new phase of biology, designing and synthesizing and synthesizing lives.
We always seeing to take big questions.
"What is life, you know, is something that many biology I believe that many levels to various levels.
We tried a different approaches, reducing it to the minimes.
We're digitalizing by almost 20 years ago.
When we sequenced the human genome is treating from the analogic world.
Now we ask us -- can regenerate life, or create new life from this digital universe from this digital universe
This is the map of a little organism, the Mycoplasma genitalium, which is the smallest species between those who can autoreplicate in the lab.
And we tried to reduce the genome of the genome to create a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit more than that.
We are able to eliminate a hundred genes of the around 500 that are here.
But when we look at the metabolic map of metabolic map respect to the now.
You're a delivered --
But when we look at all the genes that we can heliminat, is a very unlikely to bring to a liver cell.
So we decided that the only view to progresing this chromosomes in a way to be synthetic to get the components to ask the components to some of these foundations.
And so we started the wind of the "We can synthetize a chromoun?"
Can the chemistry to produce these big molecules that we never have to create before it?
And in face case we can make a chromosound?
A chemical chemical chemical material material material material.
The speed with which we are able to digitalize the life is growing up to exponential exponential run.
Our ability to write the genetic code of genetic code -- rather degrees rather loud.
And our most results the results the door recently results of the exponential curve.
We started 15 years ago.
The process has a lot of past, beginning with a biothic review review revision before the first experiments.
But we found that synthesize DNA is very difficult to be very difficult.
There are decade of thousands of cars in the world that are producing small segments of DNA, of the long rors of 30 to 50 to lect lect and it's a degenerative process.
So we have to develop a new methodd to assembling these fragments and rors and rors the middle of the game.
And this was our first attached by the digital information of the digital genome of Phi X 174.
It's a little viruses that kills killing batter.
We designed the fragments, effectured the correction of the error and get a molecule of DNA of about 5,000 letters.
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemical material and we put it in bacteria, the bacteria have started reading this genetic code and produce it began to read this viral code particles and produced it in virals
The virals are there released by cells, they're back to cells, are back and have destructed the E.
I talked about recently recently with recently oil industry saying, they tried to them that they certainly understanding this model.
They have more than you.
We believe this is a situation where the software can actually build his own hardware in a biological system.
But we wanted to do the bigger things in bigger things.
We wanted to build the whole chromosome.
They're more than 580 miles of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code.
So we thought we can built it in cassets of virus, so that we could change the cassets to understand what the components are a living cell.
The design is crucial information is crucial, if we start with digital information in a computer, these must be very accurate.
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 the standard was a standard of a mibasic error for every 10 mibasis.
We found it, 30 errors. If we had that original sequence, we never had that original sequence, we never have been able to do it work.
A part of the process is to design segment of the 50 letters that you over, you know, you have all the other segments of 50 letters to build underlying higher and working together.
We do a unique elements here.
You probably read that we read the phylie.
Think about this is what we have a gene code genetic code on four letter: A, C, Gs and T.
Three of those labor bed together about 20 friendous loads of lects, and there's a specific order to lect every loved in the loak of lects.
So we can use the genetic code to write words, frax, I think.
What we did we do at the beginning is automated.
Some have been deluses from the fact that it was not poe."
We have designed these segments for them to simply them to simply them to the same things.
There are gass that repair them and put them and put them together.
And we started assembling the particular segments from five to seven a seven of seven miles to segments of 24 in the letter to them to get 72 miles to come 72 miles of the letter.
We produced these segments in abundance in fact that we can sequence, so that we're trying to create a remarkable proceive proceiving a tremely robustop -- how you'll see in a minute.
We're trying to automatize the process.
So, this looks like the tabellon a basic players of a basic plays.
When we go to these very longments very longments, more than 100 miles -- they will not grow more directly in E.
You get to the limb tools of the modern biology of molecular biology.
So we have other mechanisms.
We knew about another mechanism called "recombination called "omology repair in biology to repaid DNA to repair seatments.
Here's a example.
This organism, called Deinococcus radiodurans, can be awful for three million radiods.
You can see in the sound requarter as his chromosomes come up with the driver.
In 12 -- 24 hours is reassembled exactly how it was before.
They have thousands of organisms that are able to do it.
These organisms can be completely set out completely.
They can live under the empty empty.
I'm absolutely certainly sure life in the space, and you move to find new environments of water.
In fact, NASA showed that this lived that this lives to do.
This is a image of the molecules we built using these processes, just using these processes, by using the design appropriate design to segments to set up segments to set up segments.
The lievid them allows them to the automatically.
This image was not taken with a electronic microscope with a microscope of rule.
It's a molecule, so big molecules we can see it with a law microscope of read.
These are photograph that they cover a period of about six seconds.
This is the publishing that we did a little time ago.
They're more than 58,000 genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code genetic code of genetic code genetic code of genetic code genets.
It's the biggest molecules that ever created by man.
It has a fish molecular high perior at 300 million of them.
If we stamp it with a 10 career without spaces, there would be 142 pages to just translate this genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of a 10 pages to get this genetic code of a 10 pages to get this genetic code of a types that are going to be 142 pages to get this genetic code that gene code genetic code
Now, how do we do it work? How can we activate it?
Obviously, you know, you take a virus.
It's a little bit more complicated when they use the bacteria.
It's just as simpler when it comes to the eucar cells as our re: you can simply extract the nucleus and put it on the nucleus and put it on the clonation.
In the archaea chromosome, is instead of integrated in the cellule, but we recently have demonstrated that we are able to do a complete traplant transplant that we can make a chromosome.
We can have a chromosomes from a species from a microbial species.
The two are different than men from the topies.
We have some genes in more more than we could decide what choose for this chromosoun.
The one one is the basic with the gases in a way to kill all the proteins.
And when we put it in the cells is stuff -- and you appreciate our choicatom -- the new chromosomes is going to go into the cellule.
And we started thinking that we couldn't go beyond it, but we tried a common to the land.
This is one of the major mechanisms of evolution.
We found that a lot of species have added a second or a third chromosomes from a second of hundreds of new tracks in a thousands of new tracks to that species.
So who think about evolution as a only gene when you get a gene of modific degree of biology.
They have the gape of the restrial restriction is that they have DNA.
The chromosomes that was in the cell phone that it was not going to be there.
The cell phone -- the chromosomes we have insert --
And it is express the other chromosome, and it has the other chromosome, it has mastic and we found out with only the cells and the new cross-cells and the new cross-cromom and the new cross-cross-cross the other cross-cross-cross-cross-cell.
it became blue to the genes we have ined.
And in a short of time, all the feature of a species are lost of a species are lost of the new species of species, and it turned into a new species, which we put in the cellule.
All the protein are changed, the membranes are changed, and when we put the gene code of exactly equivalent to what we have transfer to you.
Now, this might look at the genetics, but altering the software DNA we can change things in a ftware to changing things in a fairly stick.
Now, I already explained that you don't talk about genesis -- but by three million years from evolution, and I said that maybe it's going to create a new version of the explosion of Cambriana Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosion that will create new species on this digital process.
Why do that?
I think it's obvious enough when we think about our needs.
We're going to spend six billion people at nine billion people in the next 40 years.
Just to give a example, I was born in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for each of the planet in 194, in 194, there are going to be four.
We're going to find problems right now to find food, water and cleita, medicinal and bashion, and bass for six billion people.
It will be more harder than we do it for nine billion us.
We can lize more than five carbon dies of oil carbon of oil bar.
That means a million bark bars a day.
When we try to find biological processes or any kind of process to replace to be a huge challenge.
In the more we have to keep the CO2 emission of CO2 emission of these materials that finishes in the atmosphere.
At day, thank you for scientific discoveries in the world, we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I like to think think that are designed for the future.
The electronic industry just a dozen dozen of components, and think about how many different things are coming out of them.
Our limited here are main by biological reality and our imagination.
Now we have techniques, thank you very quickly in the synthesization, in grab to create what we call genomics combinatories.
We are able to build a big robots that can produce a million chromosomes a day.
Think about processing these 20 million different genes of different genes or trying to get optimize the processes to produce or drugs, and we can change it, we can change a little team and biology theary, and create bigger biology and create bigger than in the last 20 years of science.
And it's just a standard self as a standard self as a standard.
We can chemical chemistry of surviving chemistry or carbon of vaccines or carbon glands of vaccines --
This is a few software of some software programmed to be able to seat us and designing species and designing species to computer.
Well, we don't know necessarily how they will be no.
We know exactly what their genetic code code.
Now we're focusing on the fourth generation.
You also saw you that you extract ethanol from the grand was a finished experiment.
We have a second further, and generation that will come up pretty soon as a zero-sugar lots of higher than the higher are or different kinds of pypes of butanol.
But the only way the biology can have a big impact without major major impact the cost of food and limited the disease and light to be transforming the CO2 material that we're working to design cells that we're working for cells that we work to reach cells that we could reach them over the first carbon on the foot carbon of fourart in about 18 months.
The solar light to the combined light -- but in our discoveries in our discoveries in all the world, we found different metodis.
This is a organism that we described in 1996.
She lives in the ocean deep deep about 2500 feet of the water temperature of water.
They put from CO2 by using hydrogen molecular energy sources of energy.
We're trying to understand if we can get CO2, which can easily be transported to be transported by type that CO2 in carbant, to drive this process.
So the short we think we could be able to increase what the basic questions is Not -- we have the life" is No, trum -- we have the modest goal of oil, we have the obillion of oil industry.
Exactly if you can't do it from TED, where can you do that?
It would become a principle fundamental source.
And also, we're working for using the same metods to create vaccines.
You saw this year with the influence, we're always back, and a dollar and a dollar, and a dollar, and a dollar, and a dollars of foot in the right way.
I think that you can change build vaccinable changes in the ancient vaccinable in ancient an.
Here's how the future might begin to seem change, the evolution, the evolution, acceling evolution with synthetic bacteria and infinally indegram cells.
We are so much from the best people.
Our purpose is to make enough long enough to try to do it. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
First of all I'm going to show you the most rapidly possible, some fundamental technology that we took Microsoft in followed to a year ago in a year ago -- this is Seadragonon.
It's a environment where you can interact in the local levels that remote with a huge amount of visual data --
And this is a lot of gabyte photos of digital photos with a kind of zoom and continuous fast, to be able to images as we want to do the images as we want to hold images how we want to it.
And it doesn't matter how big the amount of information that we see, how big these data or images.
Most are communications in digital photographs but this for example is a scansion of Congress, and reaching in the gamma of Congress, and return in the gamma of 300 megapixel.
It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that limited the prastations of a system like this is the number of pixel on your screen. It's also an architecture very flexible.
This is a whole book inter, examples of data not images.
This is the See Casa desolater of Dickens. Every cool represents a chapter of
And to show you that it's just about text and not images, we can do something like this, to see what it is about a real representation of the text of the text of the text of the text of the text of the textremely representation of the text of the text and not images, we can do something like this, to see the real representation of the
It could be a little bit of an artificial book a book electronic book a electronic book
You don't look at it.
This is a more realistic. It's a number of a number of of the Guardian.
Every big image is the beginning of a section.
And it gives you the pleasure and the beautiful version of a view version of a view or a newspapers or a quotic newspapers of a matter type of a matter type of it.
We also have something with the corner of this particular number of of the Guardian.
We created a higher advertising advertising -- much higher than what you use in a normal published -- and we put you in the normal content -- and we put you in the extra.
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile, you can see here.
Or other models, or even specific specific and techniques.
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on the screen.
We hope that this means to put up and other similar and other similar to be necessary.
Of course, the map of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology.
And I don't want to lose the time, if not to say that we have contributes to give it in this field.
These are all the streets in the U.S. obsters in NASA.
So we now spent something else.
This is actually actually from the vive on the web; you can go to the web; you can go to see.
It's a project called Photosynth, which two different technologies.
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual research, a visual computer very interesting room, a student of Washington, with Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Stee Resear. Seelish collaboration.
And it's from Seadragonished by Seadragonon.
You can see it when we do this is when we make this kind of screen that we can go from a image of experience to the other and have this multiple experience of multiple.
But the space of the images here has actually a meaning of the images here has actually a meaning.
The computer algorithms of visualization have these images together, in a way that the real place that you can run the real place -- all the close to the Grashes in the Grashes on Montags -- have been taken -- have been taken elements of a clear slidestable ly. How you see elements are all college in space.
I don't know if I have time to show you some other environment.
There are some much more space than the space
I want to go directly to one of the original data set of Noah-- and this is from a previous patterns that we have done to work for the first time -- to show you what we did for the first time -- to show you what I think I think about what I think I think is really the ask of the technology -- Photosynthosynth. And it's not necessarily looking at the environment.
We had to worry about legal aspects and saying it.
This is a reconstruction of Notare Dame catter Dame images on Flickr. Basta digitate in Flickr. And you get images in Flickruns of making pictures and see a types and view -- one of these connects -- one of these construction construction represents a image that you can tell you that it's a model.
So they're all images if Flickr and have been all colleged in the space in this way.
And it is possible to navigate in this simple way.
You know, I would never have thought about to work for Microsoft.
It's very gratify to receive this kind of acior here.
I think you can see that it's a lot of different types of fun photos -- from those of the photos in the professional cell phone number of meaningful phone -- a lot of different types in this environment.
And if you can try to look at those strange strange to look at those strange.
Many are driven to do this, etc.
And it comes a series of photographs -- and there is a series of photographs --
This is a Notre poster Dame Plyster recorted.
We can spend from the placer to the physics of this environment.
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment. This is now taking from the whole memory of how the earth of view -- and it is the Earth, and college all those data together.
All those pictures become together, most of the side of the side of the side of the parts.
You have a model of the entire land that emerge.
Think about this as a model of Stephen Lawler work on Earth
It's something that is that it is in complexity as people using it in complexity and the advantages for who uses to use.
Their photograph of them are hundred meters from other people.
If someone is the idea of contrash all these sants saying the name of Notare saying the name of Notre Dame improven suddenly recchips of all those data, and I can use the weak of the ingres-point and have a handle experience of the space, in that universe, using the photos of the kind of cross-of-s-user experience of the kind of a little social experience of a type of the kind of red of a kind of a little bit of the type and cross-of-of-ink experience and and and the crossections of the ctions of the c
Of course, a consequence of this is the extremely elaborated virtual models of every interesting part of the land, and from the cleases and seem and images and satellitaries and similar to collective satellitaries.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I understood OK? What your software is going to be going to have to do is that at some point, in the next years, all the photographs shared in the next world are going to be practically connected together?
BA: Yeah. That's what is doing is doing it is going to discover.
It's creating the hyperlin, if you want to be in images.
And it's doing it in the base of the images.
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the rich information that many of these images that many of these images can education --
How do you do a research of images on the web, and the head page on the web has a lot of information about the pictures of photos.
Now, what if that picture is connected to all your picture?
So the amount of interconnection and the amount of interconnection and the amount of retable. It's a classical effect of the net.
CA: Blaise, it's really amazing.
BA: Thank you very much.
One of the main pleasures when you travel and the ethnographic research, is the power between who has no forgotten the anti-traditions, between who has no anti-traditions, between who's touches in the wind of the plants.
Basti thinking that Jaguar sciamans still beyond the Mily Way, or that the myths are still colmyths of meaning to Himalaya, and that in Himalaya, to remind the respirin Dharma, to remind the importance of the anthropologia, and that idea that we live not exists in sense of the anthropologist, but it's just a model of reality of reality of reality reality of reality of reality.
the consequence of a particular choices that our stirps that our stirps and fact, so many generations of physical generations ago.
And of course, we all share of essential tratels.
We all all the way we all produce.
We are subjects at the beginning.
We need to deal the inexorse of death, so we don't surprised and whales we have to chantive and whales --
We all have a art of art.
What it is the particular is the particular song, the ritof every culture.
Not matter that they are the forests of the Borneo, or the follows of Haiti, or the Caisut in Kaissut in Kaissut in Kenya sectonal Deerrior, or a camelilier in the heart of the Sahara.
He was my own trip in the desert of journey in the desert of yak in yak in the games of Qomolangma, the demother of the world.
All these populations teaching us that there are other ways of thinking about other ways of thinking, other ways of thinking, other ways of moving in the world.
And if you reflect a moment, it's a concept that can give you hope.
And so the myriades of cultures of the world create a ragnate; cultural life that has been the planet and is important for the benefits of the planet as the planet as the planet as the biological raise as biosphere.
And you can think about this ragnatela ethnose as an ethnose and you can call the ethnose the ethnose of all conceptive em of all concepts -- inspirations, inspirations, intuitions in being from human albath.
the ethnose is the fantastic patrimonum
It's the symbol of what we can be as as an inquist species of what we can be as a species of what we can be in the inspiry.
And because the biosphere was free to consumed high-ethnose ethnos:
No biology, for example, it would say 50 percent of all the species was or the extinction of the extinction of the axy -- in the most apocality, or the most apocality, and not close to the most optimistic diversity -- that is a populest -- that is a populest -- that is a popull -- that the most optimistic diversity.
The indication of all of this is, of course, the language.
When you were born there were 6,000 language on this planet.
A language is not just from a vocabulary or from a series of rules of rules of rules.
One language is the push of human spirit spirit of human spirit spirit of the human spirit spirit of the human spirit of the human spirit spirit of the human spirit spirit of the human spirit of the human spirit spirit of the human spirit spirit.
It's the meeting that the animal of every culture comes in the material.
English is a forest of mind, a bype of the ment, a thinking, a thinking, a thinking,
And those 6,000 languages as we are here in Monterey, at least half the half of the kids.
They don't get more teached to the children, which means you don't know, something, which is dead, which have died to die of it.
What is the more tristers than being fly in the silence, to be the last to talk to a language of going to talk about wish the wish of the avoid of the daughter?
This is a fashion was someone in some part of the world every two weeks: every two weeks a muor and leads with healthy sillabes.
And I know someone of you will tell "Is it not better way?
The world would not be a better place if we all talk about the same langu?" Benish syny, then we talk yoruba. We are all yoruba.
We talk about kogi.
You will be able to tell you that you don't have to tell your language.
I would like to do you to make a journey through ethnoser --
a little trip in ethnose to you a little bit of what we're lost.
Many of us forget that when I say "different ways of existing exists of existing exists.
Let's take for example, this Barasana, in Amazon Scentrill, the population of any-anaconda, which creates to come from the rivers of the head-side of the head.
It's a popular popular that it's not able to distinguishing the blue color, because the elests is identified in the forest, from which is identified the popular popule.
They have a strange language and a regular rule, "Look at languago's language, you have to be a different language language.
And all this has radicated in the mythological past, all the particularity is that in these families are talking about six or seven language is that there are six or seven languages are talking about a language.
They listening to listening and then they start talking about.
We take one of the most interesting tribes that I lived in the Waorans of Ecuador Ecuador who had the first contact in 1958.
In 1957, five missionary missions have tried to a fact that they had a fact that they had a face.
They made up from the high floor that they were retending them in population that they were involved that this popular popular popular popular popular wouldn't seen anything in the size of the biggest shot of the size of the biggest size.
They made the land clevered photographs have a researching of a form or a figura -- they have concluded that it was a diavold, and they killed the did, and they killed the five of five missionaries of five missionaries of five missionarium.
But the Waorans don't just killed the strange of it.
They knet between them.
Five percent of mortality was caused by their own own own stys.
We were risalited to eight generations and we found two housed of natural death and when we have a knowledge that one of them was a lot that one of them was a lot that it was dead, and then they killed him killed him it was a knowledge of the forest.
The core cactors were able to recognize the pattern of 40 and recognize the species.
In the early '80s, it was assigned a very interesting compit when my professor of Harvard was asked to go to Haiti in Haiti to intrupholarming and the chance of Duvalier and Tonton and Tontonton and Tontonton and Tonton and Tontonton of the cheese, and matter to do zombies.
To give a sense to the miracle Vodouble, I should have the Vodoubling and that the Vodouble.
It's a complex of a complex metahaphysics of the world.
Very interesting.
If you ask the big religions of the world's big religions of the world, what would you say?
Cristian, Budddhism, Buddhism, Ebraism, Eigh.
A continent is always left out of the sub-Saharan Africa-saharian is not religious religious religious -- and the Voodoo doo is not the distill, and the Voodoo deep these religious concepts that in the tragics of the slavery of the slave of the slaviligious slavish is going to be born in the slavery of the slavium.
What makes you interesting the voodor is the intense of life and dead.
So you live the spirits.
And the spirits can be invocked by the Great Ac, and they replace it replace to the dance of dancing and replace the animate animate in a way that for a short of the following is the dio.
So the voodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodon to the
We do in the temple, and we become God."
And from the moment you are going to be driving, is the spirit you drive the male?
So you know, you look at these incredible events of the excited total events. I follow the types of the power of the power of the power of the power when it was catalyzed in a state of the power when it was catalyzed in a state of exciting extreme.
And it was all the people that I lived the most extraordinary Kogi is Kogi Kogi Sierra de Santa Mars, in Colombia sect-re-re-re-re-re-re-up and the real-to-sect-re-re-re-year-old World World World World World World World World World World World Nevada de Santa Mars, in the Nevada in the Santa S.
It was going to be able to cycle civilization that once they live on the floor of Colombia in the attention of conquery, the population of the conquerges that were on the class of carefuel.
In a blood blood blood blood not been conquered by the spagnos.
At the today are governed by a clerd, but their formation is decided.
The young young people have been taken from the family to three or four years old, and they live in a world world of a done world and bombs in the glaciers for 18 years.
Two of nine years of proposed to reproduce the nine months of the gestation of the gestation of the gestation of the mother, I'm metaphorically, in the utern Great Mad.
So this time, they get acculated values to their pray values that they predict their praise and only their praise and preger their balance -- or to say the balance -- or to say the equilibrium.
And in terms of this incredible initiation, they are suddenly taken out and the first time in life in their life, at the age of 18 years, they see a high, and that weak of the first wrong wrong backy-theless, the sunsunlessons of the beautiful landscape is conferred in the spending of the beautiful landscape and saying,
"Re? Proroprio as I said,
It's just stuff is to protect it."
They call the most brothers and say that you know, brothers and say that we are the pieces of the world.
This level levels is extremely important.
When we think about the indigenous populations and the environment, we ask Rousau and the old story of the nble history of the nble history or maybe we ask Thoreu and saying these popules are closer to Earth of us.
The indigenes are not feeling feeling of the indeolites of our algia.
There is not space for these things in the malaries of the Asmall, or in the wind gelides and created a mystical lands and created a mystical of the Earth of the Earth of the basic basic concept that the Earth can live because it's a little bit of a bey: the concept that the Earth can live because it's infuses from human consciousness.
What does it mean?
And the floor of the And, who grows growing that the mountain is a spirit of Apu that is going to be a destiny and will be a deeply and have a very different relationship to a lot of function with the mountain a different mountain a foot of Montana girl, and growing that a mountain to be scaved.
which is the dimore of a spirit or a mineral care is irrileving.
What is the interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between individual and the natural world.
I grew up in the forests of Columbia Britannica creating that the forests service to be cut up.
What he made me a different human friends from my friends Kwakiuts that believe the forests are the dimoral dimoral dimoral and the well-death-well-death-well-dead and the spirits that live in the northern northern the initiation.
If you start to look at that these cultures can create different reality of them, you can start to understand some sensities. We take this plant. We take this plant. We take this plant.
I took this picture to the West Amazon the West in the West Amazon West.
Maybe some of you have heard about ayaax, the most powerful choice, the most powerful psychootic repertor of the sciamanic repertor of the sciamanic repertor of the sciamanic repertor of the sciamanic repertor of the sciamanic repertor of you have heard about the gamanic repertorial of the sciamanic repertor of you have heard about the sciamanic repertoric of the sciamn of the sciamanic repertorigin.
What makes it fascinating the ayaaxis is not the potential dyaxis of the choices of cheap. It's compound two elements.
On one but, this liane lian. She given a series of beta-carboline, harm, readly lady slightly hallucinogen.
Prunning the sun, you have a fire that high-hot cleaning up a little bit of a coffee of a good arbusts of a great arbusts of the coffee called Psychotria virids.
This plant contient tripty lightly similar service to the servotonina, dimetho-5, methoxoydimethoxoydimeymmeyer --
If you ever see Yanomy Yanomi to the nose the substance that are from a different set of species, cheese, 'd contips in meetoxoydimethoymethodmethodmeyn'thox,
To be that to go on for the nose is a little bit like being shot from a bunch of paybooks, and led to late electricity. Risate." It doesn't believe a distortion of reality. It creates the demonstration of the reality.
I was often in my professor, Richard Evan Shultes, the man who brought the man was psychedelic, with his discovered fungments in the 1930s in the 1930s in the 1930s in Mexico.
Second my textinct can classifix hallucinogens like you can't tell anybody to be able to tell anybody to be able to tell anybody to be absolutely hallucined. Risate." And they can not be absolutely because they're not such a gain the summmer that you find the monox.
It's possible to assumption, just if you assummies that money.
Now it's the beautiful beta-carbolins that you find in this lian. The same kind of needs to potentiate trip. The question to potentiate trip. The question of the smit of 80,000 species of plants, like these popules to find two dead, but if you fighting in this model, but if you combined in this way. But if you combined a biochemical version that is a chemical version that is a very much of the particulpe?
We use the great euphemism of proof of and error, which can reveal to be revealed with it.
But if we ask Indians, they will tell us "The plants speak to us "The plants will tell us about it."
What does it mean?
This tribe, Cofan, has 17 variety of ayax, which are nice in the forest, and that you have our eyes in the forest, and that you have our eyes in the same species.
If you ask them how they stabilive their tassonoms are going to tell us "I thought I was not know. I wouldn't know everybody?"
The solution is taking 17 variety in a night and a pill-side and each night and each other.
With you don't have Harvard, but it's much more interesting than to contare the stames.
Now, the problem is that the problem is that the ones of us who have heart the indigenes are pitches and some way to the margin the reality of the story of the real, and spend a real, and spent over the real world.
In fact, the 20th century, between 300 years, not be reminded for his wars or its own technologies, but rather like the technologic innovations and we have been stopped and we have embrace and we have embrace aced in the instruction of biological diversity and cultural destruction of the planet. Now the problem is not the change.
All the cultures have been involved in a dance for new possibility of life.
And the problem is not technology.
Indians Sioux doesn't stop being Sioux when they put out of a cold and freck and freck them as Americans don't have stopped to be when they put out of Americans and calculations.
It's not the change or the technology that they threat the integrity of ethnow. It's the power.
The laster of the domination.
And if you give a look at the world, you find that these are not destined cultures are not destined to disappear.
They're living and dynamics and dynamics out of identify forces that go beyond their ability to adaptation.
And I think you have disboxing in the patria of the guy --
a population of Sarawak, in Sarawak, in the south of the asian lie in the forest forest to a generation and now reduced to a generation and prostitutions on the rivers of the rivers of the rivers of the rivers of the rivers of the lim Borneo Borneo to the Mdiontons, where the navos the grandfather, where the grandfather, where the grandfather, where the horizontor in the horizonty,

Or in the case of the Yanomi, are the diseases that are coming with the pattern.
If we move on the mountains of Tibet, where I'm doing a lot of research of political domination.
As you know the genocide of a population, the physics of a population, is convicted to universal, but the ethnocide of a popular lifestyle of lifestyle lifestyle of the lifestyle of the developing of the developing of developing environment.
And you can't understand the suffering of Tibet until you get the beginning.
I have a half thousand miles from Chinina in Western China in Western Tid with a young young glands with a young young college, but only came back to Lhasa I realized statistics that we feel about the statistics that we feel about.

And it turns out all the way it comes to a choice.
We want to live in the world, the monodd world, or we want to get the polyymmatic world of different?
The big anthropologist, before it was that his biggest country said that his greatest fear was that, in our world, we don't just see the whole gam, we will not just see the whole game, we will not see the whole game, but a day, we will see it as a day, but a day we can see it from a deality -- we can see it as much as we well as we were as possible.
And it's a birth of remind that our species is existed for 600,000 years.
The Neolitical Rvolution that has given us the agriculture, which has done us to the cult of the seeds of the slide of the slide of the clevering of the clerarm with the clean of specialization, and we talk about 10,000 years ago.
The modern industrialized world has been 300 years.
That is a story of not suggests that we have the answers to all the challenges that we have to face in the millennivers that we have to come to come.
When these myriades of cultures of the world is asked what it means to be human, respond with 10,000 different voices.
And it's in these answers that we all response to the chance of being what we are.

Our work is traveling in ethnose to bring our public in place of the wonderful cultural location of cultural wonderful as they saw as they saw as they have been hopefully for the central anthropologistlation of anthropologistl, and we have to find a style place in a world world in a place in the different world.
which the wisdom of all the people can contribute to our collective benefit to our collective benefit to our collective.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some things I wrote in this book that I hope to recall other than you heard and proverse to evidence some colleging collegments in the case not us.
I would like to start with what I call the official official dog.
The official official dog,
The official official society of all the Western industrial societies and "If we want to massive the well-being of our citizen" is to myze the benefitt."
The reason for a side of it, in fact that liberedom is in a value, is preciout, is precioued, essential essential beings.
On the other is that if we are liber, each of us can act to do everything that massive our beneath our beneats, without any one that decide in name our own own own own own own own own own own own own own now.
The way to massive liberty is to massive choice.
More choices people more liber, more liber, and most liberty, and the freedom, is their head.
These right, it's so deeply radicated in society that no one would be dream of going to put it in twice.
And it's also deeply radicated in our lives.
I'm going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible.
This is my supermarket. It's not particularly large.
I allow it to me a simple note on the injuds.
In my supermarket there are 175 conditions without contrain of oil olies of oil oil and 12 acets of oil and 12 acets that you can buy to get a huge number of conditions, you can get a huge number of conditions, and the 175 already already already already you know, in your degree of your degrees.
That's the supermarket.
Then you go to the snegotic stere: CD, and bought a stere: CD, put, plifiers.
And in this single snows of electronic electronic number of audio of audio of self-dio components
We can make six million different and a half of different combinations using the components that there are in one negotid.
You know, you have a lot of choice.
Other camp: the world of communications
One volted, when I was a child, you could get all the service phone cell phone desireable to get out of the wish of the wish Bell.
He walked the phone, you didn't buy it out.
A consequence of that, between the other, was that the phone doesn't rop.
These are the time agree of the day.
We have a variety of phones almost illitated cell phones, especially between cellphones.
Here's the future.
My favorite is the MP3, lettor MP3, cutting the nase, and form in the book for cras.
If you don't have the hot yet you have seen in the house store you saw it will be pretty well-hand-up in the house you have seen in the house.
And what the end is that people go into the negozos and does this question. And you ask the answer is "No."
You can't buy a cell phone that you don't do too many things.
So, in other aspects of life that are much more important than the water of the same explosion of choices.
Assistance of healthcare of the United States that you go from doctor and the doctor you have to do.
Instead, you go to the doctor, and the doctor says, "Oke, would we do A, we could do A, or B" "As it has these goods" and these risk risk and these risks. What do you want to do?"
You know, "Dr, what would I do?"
And the doctor says, "As these risks, and these risks, and these risk risk and these risk risk and these risk risk and these risk gos."
"What do you want to do?"
And you know, "Dr. If she was to me, what to do?"
And the doctor: "But I'm not le."
The result is called the malato's autonomy of the malato," expression that it seems to be a beautiful thing.
But it doesn't really is a fish and the responsibility to take decisions to someone who knows someone that someone else that you know anything about someone else that you don't know -- and so in the ideal conditional to be did, and so not in the ideal conditional decisions to get decisions the patient.
There's a huge marketing products drugs, I would say people like me and you, if you think about you, and if you think about it has no sense, given us that we can't buy it.
But if we can't buy them, why do we published them do?
The answer is that they want domor we call the doctor to change the recipe of changing the recipe of changing the recipe.
Something so the fundamental is our identity is a choice, as you see in this view in this vignet. We don't want to force the children. We don't want to force the right time to the right right right now, we have to invent.
And we can reinvention us how many times we agree to us again the way.
which means that every morning to the morning, you have to decide that kind of persons you want to be.
Riped to the family and mathem, a time perspective and the common, ungranted to anyone in the one that was the most pretty possible, and he started the most pretty possible, and he started the pretty much as possible.
The only true choice was with choice was with choice, and not even what to do later.
Ogo, everyday is really to play.
I mean, very smart students and I think about 20 percent in less of work respect to a time.
And because they're not less brilliant, because they're not less diligent.
but why are I impensive to ask them, "I should be going to ask me or no? Dove, I should do it now?"
"I should be able to get more tardi? I have to think about the children or care?"
They're interrogative interruple of logor.
And they try to answer these questions, even if this implements not completely to be able to get a bunch of your example.
And they really have to do it. They have to ask questions.
Now, the work: we are lucky, like Carl undertholeava, because the technology allows us to work every day, from every day on the planet, trans that from Hotel Randolphe.
To parented to the corn, and I don't tell anybody where, where the Wies work.
You don't say that I want to use it.
What does that an amazing liberty that we have to work in the work? What we have to decide -- if we have to work or not.
We can go to the calculate on the cell phone, with the cell phone, and the needs Blackberry in other, and the needs tebook, typically on the eye and the eye tebooks.
And even though they're all scales, every minute that we see our boy wind the game, we're also asking this call?"
"I have to answer this email? I got to abboat this letter?"
And even when the answer is "no," all this makes the experience of your boy of the game, a very different boy from what would be in other conditions.
So, from any part of the look at things and large objects and large objects and big, life is a question of choices.
Once the world was this -- there were some choice, there were some choices. But it was not a choice.
The world today is this is a positive thing about this: "Is it a positive thing to it, or negative negatives?"
The answer is She's She's got the answer is Shim.
The positive side of the baside of the negative snows.
All this choice two negative effects two negative effects on the people.
The first one, heavy, heavy, is that produces instead of instead of instead of of liberation.
And many options of the options that it becomes very difficult to do it.
I want to give you an example meaning: a study study conducted plans of volunteering planes.
A colleague had access to the data of the Vancers, the gantended society with about a million clients of though, with about a million clients in 2,000 different companies.
What she found is that for every 10 solutions that are offered in the floor, the percentage of adesion.
With 50 sources there is 10 percent less than the 10 percent of the desions of when they have only 5. Why?
Because with 50 founds of foundly difficult to decide is maledetails, and choice is remained to question.
And the questions, and the questions, and the questions, and of course, it doesn't have the questions of it.
You know, you don't just mean that these workers will be making food, because they don't have enough food, you want to say that the decision is so ostic that decision is so ostic that decision is that they lost the founds of working.
Don't participand, they're loating to 5000-dollars for a data from work, which would be well to the test to the top.
So the paralysis is a consequence to have too many choices.
And I think that makes the world like this.
"And finally, for ethis: "ethish eth, or major major maion?"
You would like to take the right decision if it's for eth, right?
You don't want to choose the wrong source, and nep, the wrong condition
So this is the first effect. The second is that even if we can avoid the paralysis and make a choice, we end up from the result of how we would be states with less options that we were with less to be with less options in the way.
And this for different reasons.
One of these is that with a lot of conditions that would be bought to chood, if you buy a different choice, is easy to imagine that you could have a different choice. And what happens is going to be better than it would be better than it would be better than the alternative imagined us the choice, and the remains the reliefs of choice, and the remain deline of choice,
even when it was a very good decision.
More choices us -- the more easy than anyone details that it's insumption of choice.
But the economists is what economists call the cost-opportunity.
Dan Gilbert asked a very well stamning as the value that we are going to depends on what we confrontive it.
In the rest of the options of the options of the alternal features of alternative alternative choices and be less to be less satisfied in the option that you have choice.
Here's a example. I sorry with all those who are not New York.
But it's what you probably thinking.
There's this copy-crope to Hamptons.
A place of lus.
Spid day. Otype of day. It's all about them.
Not anything. But what he thought he is, "Well, what he thinks is August."
"All my neighbors in Manhattan are vie."
"I could talk about the front of the front of the front of the front of the hous."
And it turns two weeks assilled by the idea that it's losing -- every day -- the chance of parking where you want.
The expensive opportunity of declines the soddisftion for what we have, even when the choice was excellent.
And the more the options we have to consider the more characteristics will go back to how expensive against how expensive expensive opportunity.
Here's another example.
This view is a lot of things.
We talk about the moment, and maybe the live moment, and maybe the live of live live to live the slowly.
But the most important point is that anything you choice, you choices you shoot the ones of not to do others.
The things that we don't choose have a lot of four active active what we do.
Terze, the spiral growing expectative.
I tried on my skin, I tried to my skin a couple of jeans.
I almost the jeans.
Once jeans were a jeans of a type, they were bought to bestia, they were dissimiles, only after they brought a life and worked on a lot of times, they started to go good.
So, I went to buy a couple of new when the old old old were gone, and said, "I need a couple of jeans, this is my cuteans, this is my cute."
The common, "Well you want to slim fitted me slim fit?"
Would you like the cerness or with the bottons "Stonebones" or ""Liidd" or "Is it it?
"Li wants the road?"
"Soth eight you want to get them or stretty? Bla blap -- he was elense to elense it.
I was hear in the wine, and after a little I got a little bit of cheans, which was the only guy's the only guy -- he had no idea what I was going to try to be so for a jeans, and I tried all the disease -- and the best couple of jeans, and the best couple of jeans that I had ever had it.
It was the myself. With all that choice had the bol.
But I felt worse about it.
Why? I wrote a book interest to understand it.
The reason I was worse is that I was worth with all that choices were altish altish and jeans had to be perfectly perfects.
And I had expectations of mine. I didn't expected anything when there was a guy when it only a guy, but when you live about 100 different guys to be perfect.
What I had water was good one, but not perfect it.
After I was talking about what I was trying to get to what I was trying to get insumption to the waiting.
The add of options in life of the people does not increasing the expectations that these have respects.
And this will produce less sodden when the results are good here.
No one in the world of marketing it makes it content.
Because if you know what I'm talking about, you know, what I'm talking about.
The trutes more looks like.
"You was better when he was worth worse when he was worse when he was worth worth of when it was worse when it was worse when it was worth possible to meet the surprised of the surprised pleasant to meet the pleasant the pleasant when it was worth.
Ogame, in the world where we live -- opulents, industrialized citizens with expectancy -- the massive we can hope is that things are at the high-waiting way.
You never have any surprised because your employing, because your aspects, my waiting expectancy and expectancy.
The secret of happiness -- what you're here -- "Yes, "Yes, "Yes, "Yes, you want it."
I mean, little time I mean, little time I -- which I really feel -- which I really wouled and is really wonder.
I couldn't have it better, I didn't have any reacted.
But I don't always have a bad thing.
And finally, a consequence of the couple of jeans when there is only that kind of jeans is that when you don't have satisfied and ask you "Y?"
"Who is responsible?" "Well is clear it is.
The world is the responsible. What would I do about it?
When there are hundreds of jeans, and you buy a jeans, and you ask you who is responsible, and you ask you who is responsible you to you, is the responsible you to you,
You could do it better.
With hundreds of varieties available for the insuccess.
So when people take decisions, even if the result is valid, you feel insatisfid, they feel insatisfills and give them a chole.
In the last years the depression is exploded in the industrialized world.
I think a fact that a fact -- not the unique, but the important -- this depression is that people have depression is that people have experiences because the standard standard is too landard is too fall.
And when they have to explain this situation think that the colp is them,
So the final result is that we are better, objectively, but we feel worse about it.
Let me tell you that you us.
This is the official dog, what we all take for good and it's completely false. It's not true. It's not true.
There is no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than I haven't going to be better than a lot of choices is better than a little bit of a whatever.
There's a critic, magic value to it.
But I'm sure we have been fairly enough to a piece of the level that the best choices that choices our life.
Now, from the political point -- I have almost finished -- from the policy point of view is the following point of view is the follow.
What it allows you all this choice in the industrial society is the weith.
There are many places in the world, and you know about a lot of places that the problem is not that have too many choice.
The problem is that they have too much of it.
So the face that I'm talking about is a malesclusive to the modern and the Western, rich societies.
And what it does depress and arrablear is this -- Steve Levitt told you about iers of how much expensive and comfortable seats for bill-basic spread.
I mean, these choice, complicated and dispendous, it's not just useful.
They're deleted dely.
They do it worse on worse on the worse of it.
If a little bit about what our society allows a lot of choices was reververted in those where people have too chance too chemice, but also well, it doesn't be the now.
This is what economists is a better better pareties are called a pareties.
A red-red-red-red-income red-poor poor -- not just the poor whom of this choice in that comes back to us back in the except of the red-to-poor reds.
And he said, "Look, you can become all of the thing you want, "...
You know, people of culture, "What does that weight that fish, "What does that fish?"
"It's obvious that you can't make anything in a glass of glass of glass
"As a fall, a view vision of the world."
and I got it on this and I interpreted it like this, at the beginning.
But then, I think about it, invest, I realized that that fish the long weight of the long weight.
Because the reality of the facts is that if you eat the frank mmmyself, "everything is possible." You get the freedom. You get the paralyside.
If you break the mouse of the mouse of the sodden sodden sodden sodden sods.
You can get the paralysis, and you reduce the well.
They all need a sphere.
This is almost certainly too stretch, perhaps even for us.
But the absence of some symbolic symbolic elicity for inficity and teme the wine.
Thank you very much.
