The year I've been <unk> these <unk> to <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk>, who <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, it's <unk> <unk>, it's <unk> <unk>, it's <unk> <unk> <unk>, it's <unk> <unk>.
And we <unk> this <unk> <unk> is because it's not <unk> the ice of the ice.
The <unk> <unk> <unk> is, in a sense, the <unk> of the <unk> system.
It's <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
The next <unk> will be a <unk> on the last years.
<unk> <unk> are <unk> in the <unk>.
You see, you're <unk> to the blue <unk>.
What is the ice in <unk>, which <unk> <unk> <unk>.
You can see that the <unk> <unk> ice or five years, the most of five years, which is how <unk> <unk> from the body.
In 25 years is <unk>, so, so.
This is a problem because the <unk> of the <unk> in the ocean, where there are very very lot of <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> are <unk> in <unk>.
<unk> to the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>, that that could be <unk>, that you can't <unk> this point of this point of the <unk>.
In some <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk>. It's <unk> from water.
The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk>, a <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>! <unk>! <unk>: <unk>. The question is if you're <unk>. The question.
A reason is that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk>.
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> had never never been <unk> <unk>.
This is the <unk> <unk>, in the <unk> <unk>.
If you want to know how you you want to know how you you want to <unk> the <unk>, is where the <unk> <unk>.
These are <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> other planet: <unk>, the most <unk> of the planet.
The month, the month have <unk> that the <unk> of the ice is in <unk>, and that <unk> <unk> on some <unk>, it's <unk>, it's <unk> in a <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. <unk> <unk> <unk>, like <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, the third most <unk> of ice, you see new <unk>, who are a few years ago.
<unk> percent of the world <unk> <unk> <unk> from the world <unk> from what <unk>.
<unk> <unk>: this is the water of this is the <unk> of this city.
The <unk> is <unk>.
But when <unk>, the same <unk> is <unk>.
In, the <unk> <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> <unk> percent.
<unk> <unk> are in the <unk>.
<unk>, as you have <unk>, they're <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> in the world in the world in the <unk>.
The <unk> are <unk> <unk> to a <unk> <unk> out from the <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> times <unk> in the last <unk> years to the last years to <unk> <unk>.
This is a <unk> of all <unk>.
If you look at the <unk> <unk>, if you can see the <unk>.
In the last five years we have <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> every day -- 25 million <unk> <unk> in the ocean in the ocean in the ocean.
Look at the <unk> area of the <unk> <unk>, from <unk>, <unk>, and on the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, where there's a <unk> of <unk> in the ocean.
The <unk> of the global global global <unk>, and <unk>, which is 20 percent, is the <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
The oil is a problem, and the <unk> <unk> is even even even even even <unk>.
The United States are one of the two countries with the most <unk>,
And they're <unk> to build a lot of <unk> <unk>.
But we're going to <unk> a <unk> of <unk>.
These are the <unk> <unk> in the last years and some <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And so, there's a <unk> <unk> <unk> in our country.
The <unk> of the <unk> and the oil <unk> million dollars in the last year in the last year for <unk> <unk>, which is a <unk>.
I'm going to <unk> me --
<unk> <unk>, in <unk>, where I was a <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> billion <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
You've seen you saw on <unk>.
This is the second <unk> of <unk> in America.
It's happened in <unk>.
The <unk> of a <unk> of a <unk> of <unk> was this.
<unk>: <unk> ♫ ♫ <unk> <unk> is a kind of <unk> and <unk>.
It's <unk> here in America, and it's <unk> our economy.
<unk> the <unk> is always more <unk>.
It's good good good, <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> <unk> here is a lot of <unk> <unk>.
The big <unk> <unk> in the <unk> is <unk>. This is this is his <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk> -- <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> -- not know what they're not talking about what they're talking.
<unk>: So, the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This is a part of them, a part.
<unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> as a <unk> <unk> like a <unk> <unk> to our <unk>.
For this <unk> is <unk> <unk> a big <unk> of money in a <unk> <unk> to make <unk> and <unk> the <unk> of <unk>.
In fact, the <unk> don't <unk>.
We think it's <unk> -- it's a good <unk>.
So, not <unk> <unk> in the change.
We're going to do.
<unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk> -- you've heard about very much.
So I'm going to <unk> a <unk> to <unk> as a <unk> <unk>.
<unk>! The <unk> are <unk>, but this is the <unk> of the <unk> of the technology of the technology of the technology of the technology.
The <unk> of <unk> is between the <unk> <unk>, but the <unk> <unk> technology, but the <unk> of <unk> technology.
<unk> a look at a look at this is the <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk>, and that <unk> <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> <unk> is in the economy; the economy, the economy, the <unk>, the <unk> <unk>,
The <unk> that <unk> all of the <unk>: our <unk> <unk> <unk>, as the <unk> and <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk>.
Now, there's a new <unk>, <unk> <unk> to <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, a 100 percent of energy <unk>, in the years.
A <unk> for <unk> America in the work, <unk> <unk>, and to help <unk> the global <unk>.
<unk>, a <unk> <unk> that we're going to be to <unk> our problems.
<unk> America. <unk> <unk>.
<unk>: This is the last last.

<unk> <unk> two: <unk> <unk> <unk> for places.
<unk>: <unk> <unk>. It's time to be <unk>.
<unk>: A <unk> <unk> <unk> said, "If you want to go, you're going to go to <unk>,
If you want to go to them, you. "
We have to go to them, <unk>.
Thank you very much.
The year year I got a <unk> <unk> on <unk>.
And <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> on how it works.
So, I'm going to <unk>. And for the other time, there were the <unk> is the most <unk> of <unk>.
The <unk> is <unk> of <unk> <unk>, who were <unk> in a <unk> of a <unk> of the universe -- to <unk> million times to <unk> million times,
And that's just <unk>.
This is the <unk> machine.
<unk> these <unk> <unk> in the <unk>.
This is what I work. It's called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This is a image of <unk> <unk> in <unk> in the <unk>.
The 10 year we <unk> at the last year we've got to the first time.
And this picture was <unk> by <unk>.
It was <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk>.
It's a image of the first <unk> of the first <unk> of <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk>, with a part of <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> in the <unk>.
<unk> words, when I'm going to <unk> the 10 <unk>, <unk> that the <unk>, the <unk> is a big <unk>.
I don't know if it was this to <unk> to <unk>, or this, when somebody <unk> on your <unk> and <unk> that the <unk> was this.
What means we had a <unk> <unk> <unk> in what we had a <unk> <unk>.
<unk> a week, there was a problem with the <unk>, I had to be here to these <unk> here -- these <unk> <unk>.
These <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> when the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Now, the <unk> of you <unk> <unk>, and <unk>, "<unk>," <unk>, "I'm not too <unk>."
And instead can do that when they're very <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
So, in less <unk> <unk>, to a <unk> <unk> <unk> to the space of the <unk>, these <unk> can <unk> that <unk>.
In a <unk> of the most <unk> of <unk> in <unk>, there was a <unk> <unk>.
So the <unk> <unk> <unk>, and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This was a result.
Now, this is more <unk> if you think that these <unk> <unk> <unk>, and that they are <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
They're <unk> about 50 <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, what we did.
We have <unk> and <unk>.
Now, they're <unk> all to them to <unk>.
<unk> the end of <unk> <unk>. It's going to be <unk> to be <unk>.
<unk>, and we <unk> to <unk> data to <unk> or <unk>, and <unk>, and so our <unk> to understand what we're <unk> to what the universe are <unk> that <unk> the universe.
Now, of course, in a way, these <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> on the <unk> of science and <unk>.
I think the fact that's so hard, the fact, the fact, I think that's the <unk> of things like <unk>.
I'd like to <unk> the words of a <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk>, his <unk>, his <unk> was <unk>, "<unk> was <unk>," <unk>, "<unk>," <unk> is a <unk> for human <unk>.
Thank you.
I want to <unk> to <unk> <unk> when they <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> as <unk> and <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> to the way that we <unk> <unk> in the world.
So, from <unk> <unk> <unk> from our <unk> <unk> with <unk>, and I started to my <unk> <unk>, and my <unk> <unk>, I started <unk>, I started <unk>, and I started <unk>, when a computer <unk>, you know, you know, you know, and <unk>, and <unk> a <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk>,
and <unk> our <unk>?
The question was so interesting that we're going to try to look at the answer, the <unk>.
In a lot of words, a computer <unk> is a <unk> computer as a <unk>.
In a lot of words, a computer <unk> is a <unk> computer as a <unk>.
You can <unk> them with your hand, can <unk>, "<unk> between their <unk>, and they're a <unk> and a <unk>.
But <unk>, they're <unk> <unk>, as <unk>, they can just <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> are the example of a new <unk> <unk> to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
And <unk>, as they're more <unk>, <unk> of the <unk>, of the other, and <unk> <unk>, the <unk> of the <unk>, of the other, as <unk>, as <unk>, as <unk>, as <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's a little simple example.
This is <unk> <unk> to show you to show you the video: if you're going to be <unk>, if you <unk> the other <unk>.
These <unk> are <unk> <unk> of other other.
If you know, they're <unk>, they're going to do it.
If they're <unk>, <unk> and they can <unk> a little bit.
If they're <unk>, <unk> and they can <unk> a little bit.
<unk> also their <unk> and <unk>.
We're <unk> that we <unk> that a interesting interesting interesting <unk> of the <unk> was the <unk> <unk> on data, to the data, to the <unk> of the data, as if it was a <unk>.
In this case, we have three <unk> <unk> <unk> as <unk> and I can <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk>, where you can <unk>.
And I can <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk>, where you can <unk>.
If you're <unk> too, we can <unk> a little bit of place.
I'm also <unk> to <unk>, as the <unk>, as <unk>, the <unk> and <unk>, where people can make things, and <unk> things, and <unk> <unk>.
Now I'm --
This is a <unk> <unk> of <unk> that I do with a <unk> <unk>.
Here we have a <unk> <unk> of words that is to <unk> and <unk>.
<unk>, to every <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> on every <unk>, <unk>, to every <unk> <unk>, and as a <unk> <unk>, and as a <unk> <unk> of <unk>. <unk> a <unk> <unk>.
And then, after about 30 <unk>, and you have a new <unk> of <unk> and new <unk>.
Thank you.
Here's here, the <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk>, I did in <unk>, I did a <unk> <unk>.
<unk> are <unk> very <unk>.
And one of the things of this is that that's not to people to people to people.
<unk> just say, "<unk> <unk>," and they know what they know.
Here's other people who <unk>.
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk>, there's a little bit, there.
In fact, he wanted to <unk>.
They were just <unk>, for him.
Now, this is a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> a <unk> to build a <unk> for <unk>. He's <unk>.
It's <unk> new <unk> in the <unk>, <unk> their <unk>.
It's <unk> new <unk> in the <unk>, <unk> their <unk>.
So, this is doing the <unk>.
<unk>: The <unk> is <unk>.
<unk> <unk>: Now, he <unk> a <unk> in the <unk>.
<unk>: The <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> work!
So <unk> <unk> and <unk> can <unk> <unk> and <unk> to <unk> the <unk> --
<unk>: <unk>!
<unk> <unk> your story.
<unk>: <unk>!
<unk>: It's a story with the <unk>, and can do it.
<unk>: It's a story with the <unk>, and can do it.
<unk>: <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
<unk>: The last example I've got the time to show you is a <unk>, to <unk> and <unk> music.
It's a <unk>, <unk> <unk>, for <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> here <unk> <unk> <unk> as the <unk>, and <unk>.
<unk> of these has four <unk>, and you can <unk> that you can use.
You can also also <unk> these <unk> in a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And I'm going to <unk> a <unk> <unk> and a <unk>. "
These are actually that you can <unk> from the <unk> and <unk>.
And I'm going to <unk> a particular <unk> and then <unk> to <unk>.
And then there are the <unk> as a time and <unk>, who <unk> <unk> to the whole <unk>.
<unk> as it's not.
<unk>: <unk> <unk> a <unk> in two <unk> <unk> <unk>, "<unk>, the <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
Now, I'm going to <unk> a <unk> in the <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk>. Now, <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> <unk>. And now I can <unk> the <unk>, so I can <unk> the <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> <unk>, I'm going to <unk> the time, or the other other other, or the other other other.
<unk>: <unk> <unk>. And now I'm going to <unk> the <unk> to <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> <unk>, I'm going to <unk> the <unk> to the <unk>. "
So I don't have to <unk> before, but I can <unk>, more or <unk>.
And now, I can <unk> the whole <unk> <unk> to the left the <unk> <unk>. "
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my <unk> is to new <unk> <unk> <unk>, more <unk> to how our brain <unk> and <unk>.
And I had been time to show you a <unk> of this <unk> of this, and some of this <unk>, and some of this <unk>.
And the idea that I want to <unk> is this new generation of <unk> to <unk> with the <unk> <unk>, that we're going to be information in our world.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the now of you.
I'm a <unk>.
<unk>, <unk>, but it's more than this, of this, of course.
It's also love and the <unk> of my life.
And not what you can change.
But, I said, this, something like this, and my life, who <unk> me to <unk> the <unk>, who <unk> me to <unk> the whole work.
The particular thing is I <unk> to <unk> this book called "<unk>, this book called" <unk>, "<unk>," <unk>, and a <unk> of <unk>, for some of the world and a <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk>.
And the result is that <unk> <unk> now, people like <unk>, people like if I was <unk>.
<unk> -- <unk>, <unk>!
I'm going to me to me and me, "You don't know, you're not going to do better better than to do better?
You don't know you're going to to <unk> all of life, and more than a book that you can <unk> to somebody? "
What can you <unk>? "
It's <unk>, you know.
But could be to be, to the most of the <unk>, and I'm going to say, when I mean, I wanted to say, I wanted to be a <unk>.
<unk> <unk> to the same <unk> of <unk>.
And people said, "You know," I don't <unk> to have to have?
You don't know that <unk> <unk>?
You don't know that you're going to do that that <unk> you're not going to be <unk> and <unk> on a <unk> of <unk> <unk> with your <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>? "
<unk> so, you know.
The answer -- the answer is the way to all these questions is, "
And I'm sure of all the things.
I've always been <unk>.
And I also think of many of many other things that they don't have <unk>.
And as the <unk> and other things.
But, to how about what I thought I was and I'm going to me and I'm going to me to me and I'm going to me to me and I'm going to do what what I'm going to do?
Is it <unk>?
It's <unk> that who <unk> <unk> to be <unk> from a job that was <unk> to do.
But what there's so particular <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> on <unk> <unk> to <unk> on a way that other <unk> are not?
How my father was a <unk> <unk>, he was a <unk> <unk> and I didn't know, one time, I'm not going to be <unk> if he was <unk>?
You never been been been -- that <unk> of <unk> <unk>, how?
You don't know how <unk>?
<unk>, the <unk> <unk>, as a group, in <unk>, in <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We <unk>, we have enough enough to <unk>, and not just <unk> of every kind of <unk>, we have this <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
And they don't know that <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, who are just <unk>, <unk> and they're <unk> and <unk> for them.
And they also don't have <unk> to be <unk> to be <unk> from their <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, before, before, in the last <unk> said, "Every book," My book was a little bit more <unk> about life.
But I'm not going to <unk> when we've heard these things so we've heard these things that in some way that <unk> and <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> that <unk> and <unk> and <unk>, and <unk> and <unk>, and <unk> and <unk>, and <unk> and <unk>, and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk>, and <unk> and <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk>,
And the question I want to <unk> you to <unk> all today is, right today?
I'm going to be good, because I also <unk> from a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
I think it's <unk>.
And I think it's also <unk> and I don't want to <unk> in the next century.
I think it's better better <unk> to live in a <unk>.
And I know, I know, in my -- in my case, in my <unk>, I would be very <unk> to <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, in my <unk>.
<unk> -- I'm pretty young, I've been about 40 years.
I'm still about four <unk> of work in me.
And it's very <unk> that any <unk>, and then I'm going to be <unk> from the world as the world as the last book.
<unk> <unk>, because we're all more or less than the most of my most <unk>.
Oh, <unk>, who thought!
You know this is this is a person to <unk> to <unk> to <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> and I don't want to <unk>.
I'm going to do this work that I love.
So, the question, how?
And so, it seems to me, and that the way to work to work to <unk>, and what do is a <unk> <unk> <unk>, OK?
I'm going to be a <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk>, and my <unk>, and my <unk> <unk> on what I'm going to be <unk>, and then, as we'll get all the <unk> of the <unk> year as a <unk> <unk> of <unk>, and <unk> to <unk>, to find more <unk>, and <unk> to <unk> and <unk>, if you can find more ideas to <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
as to help people <unk> to people to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> of <unk>.
And that <unk> me to <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
<unk> because <unk>, <unk> and then <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> -- people don't think about <unk>, <unk>, OK? OK?
It <unk> that's this <unk> of creativity, and <unk> that <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, for <unk> and <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> these <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk>. "
<unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> to have a <unk> that <unk> <unk> from <unk>.
<unk> were the same idea, but <unk> <unk> that species of the body.
The <unk> is <unk>, because the <unk> don't really really really <unk> that a <unk> was a <unk>.
<unk> that a <unk> was this species of <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, in the <unk> of a <unk> <unk>, a little <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of this species of the <unk> of this species.
<unk> <unk> is, that's the <unk> <unk> of what I talk -- that <unk> you to <unk> the <unk> of your work.
And all of <unk> that was so <unk>, right?
So, <unk> <unk> were <unk> <unk> things, like to <unk> things, as a too <unk>, not?
If your work was not <unk> <unk> all of all <unk>, all <unk> that <unk> was <unk> by this <unk> <unk>.
If your work, it was not all <unk>, your work, right?
All <unk> that was your <unk> to be a <unk>.
And so people <unk> <unk> <unk>, to <unk> <unk>, for very time.
And the <unk> <unk> and all <unk>, and <unk> this idea, and <unk> this idea, we see the universe in the universe of the universe and <unk> and more space and <unk> and <unk> and more space that <unk> from the <unk>.
This was the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and people to think about that <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And for the first time, you're <unk> to <unk> this or that, or that a <unk> <unk> to a <unk> that to a <unk> person.
And I have to <unk>, I think it was a big big <unk>.
I think I <unk> to someone, a simple person to be a <unk> like a <unk> as a <unk>, and <unk> of all the <unk> of all the <unk> of all the <unk>, <unk> and <unk> <unk>, and <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> to human human <unk>.
It's like to somebody of <unk> the <unk>.
<unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> all these <unk> <unk> on <unk>.
And I think it's been this <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk>, in <unk> <unk>.
And, if this is true, and I think that's the question, and I think it's the question, and now?
Can we we do it?
I would be to a more <unk> of the <unk> between human <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
Or you don't.
We can't <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> years in a <unk> of <unk> <unk> in a <unk> minutes.
And there's people in the audience that <unk> <unk> <unk> on <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk>, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, there's probably people.
You don't have to <unk> all about this thing.
But the question I would like to <unk> is -- why?
Why don't you know that?
Because it has more than every other thing that has been heard to <unk> <unk> <unk>.
A process that, as you have been <unk> to do something -- so, so, all here -- so, you know, you know, you know, you're not <unk>.
And, in fact, can <unk> <unk>.
I did this <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk>, who has been now, and <unk>, but that was a <unk> for life and said, and he said, and he said, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk>,
I said, he was like a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And that <unk> <unk> <unk> to her from <unk>.
And I was <unk>, because he was <unk> on the <unk> on his <unk>.
And I'm going to have a only thing to do that that point and he was, "<unk> as a <unk>."
And so I was <unk> to home and he was <unk> from this <unk>, and they didn't have to <unk> a piece of <unk> and a <unk> <unk>, as a piece of <unk>, as <unk> and <unk> on the <unk>, and <unk> on the <unk>.
<unk> times times, not <unk> to be enough, so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and she would be <unk> and her and she would be <unk> and she would be <unk>, as a <unk>, as he said, "<unk>." "" "
And there were those times -- this piece of this piece of the <unk> were <unk> -- there were <unk>, OK?
So, was <unk> to <unk> and he was trying to <unk> and <unk> the <unk> and <unk> a <unk> <unk>, and he said, and he said, and then he said, and then he was <unk>, and then he was, and then he was <unk> with the <unk>.
<unk> the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> in his body and <unk> on the <unk>.
And in these, the <unk> would be <unk> on the <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, but the last <unk>, the last first <unk>.
So when I <unk> <unk> <unk> -- it's <unk>, it's just <unk> to my process.
I don't all my process -- I'm not a <unk>!
I'm a <unk>, and my way to <unk> is; <unk> <unk>, and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> on the same day and <unk> on.
But even I <unk>, I <unk> <unk>, I <unk> <unk> with that, as well.
And I <unk> that we also <unk> to do it.
You know, if the work and the ideas and the ideas to me to <unk> a <unk>.
And what's this thing?
And as we can <unk> it to <unk> it, you don't do <unk> <unk>, but but they <unk> <unk> <unk>?
For how much much much example, the best example I have is the <unk> <unk>, which I <unk> <unk>, the <unk> years ago, to a <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, and you know, and you know, for the <unk> of life was the <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> of <unk>, <unk> these species of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> of these species of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
But then <unk>, <unk>, and a day as a day as a day as a <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> all of him.
<unk>, and all of all a <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>, which is <unk>, which is <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, you know, it's <unk>, and <unk>, but <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>
He didn't have a piece of <unk>, he didn't have a <unk>, it's not a <unk>.
So, I'm going to <unk> this species of <unk> <unk> in he, "I'm going to <unk>, and <unk> from this <unk>.
I'm not not <unk>, and I can't <unk>. "
And, you know, you're <unk>.
<unk> the whole process of <unk> and he was something new <unk>.
<unk> just the <unk> and said, "<unk>, you don't know that?"
"You know that you can look at a song now?
If you really want to <unk>, you can <unk>, when I can <unk> <unk> to you.
<unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> today.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. "
And his process, <unk> <unk> after this.
I don't work, the work was still <unk> as always <unk>.
But the process, and <unk> <unk> that was <unk> when <unk> was <unk> when the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk> that he was <unk> out of him, and <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>.
but I'm <unk> this <unk>, <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> and this <unk>, and <unk> that <unk> was not <unk>.
So, as I <unk> that story to change a little little bit to change that I'm going to be a time.
This idea, I was <unk> when I was <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>," <unk>, "and <unk> in a <unk> of the <unk> that we're working on and we're not going to think about something and we're not going to think about what what you can think about a book.
Not just <unk>, right, right right, I'm going to be <unk>.
And I'm going to think about this project.
But then I <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> and <unk>.
So I <unk> my <unk>, on the <unk> and <unk> my <unk> <unk> and <unk> my <unk>.
And I said, "<unk>," <unk>, what we know if we know if this book, you don't be <unk> to my book, right?
Because you see, I'm going to do this. I'm not more than this.
So if you want to do you and do you have to do and do your part.
OK. But if you don't do, what you know, you know, you know, you know, if you know, you know, you know, you know, if you know, but you know, you know, if you know, you know, you know, if you know, if you know, you know,
<unk>, to <unk> the same because it's my work.
And I'd like to <unk> that was <unk> I'm going to do my part of the <unk> -- -- to do it -- -- -- -- <unk> in the <unk> of Africa in the <unk> of Africa, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk> to <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk>, and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk>, and <unk> and <unk>, and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk>, and <unk> and <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And they were always <unk>, because the <unk> were <unk> and they were <unk>.
But every much, <unk>, something <unk>, and one of these <unk> <unk> in <unk>.
And I know what I'm about, because I know, because I know you all, a point, a <unk> <unk>.
It was as if time you know, and the <unk> <unk> <unk> through a <unk> of <unk> and he was not doing a different different <unk>, as the <unk> <unk>.
And at the <unk> not just <unk> as a human.
But they <unk> from <unk> and <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>.
And when this <unk>, the time, people <unk> what was, and people who was, <unk> with his name.
<unk> your hands and <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, God," God, God, "God," God, "God," <unk>. "
That's God, you know.
<unk> <unk> -- when the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk> this <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>," <unk>, "<unk>," <unk>, "<unk>," <unk>, "<unk>," <unk>, "<unk>," <unk>, "<unk>,"
In <unk>, when a <unk> <unk> was something of <unk> and <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>," <unk>, <unk>, "<unk>," <unk> -- a <unk> <unk> <unk>, "<unk> <unk>," <unk>, "<unk> <unk>," <unk>, "<unk>," <unk>, "<unk>," <unk>, "<unk>," <unk>, "<unk>," <unk> <unk>, "
And it's because we need.
But, the problem is the <unk> day after, for the <unk>, when they <unk> and <unk> that are <unk> and <unk> <unk> of God and <unk>.
It's just a <unk> <unk> with <unk>, and maybe maybe maybe you never <unk> to <unk> that that's not <unk> to <unk> that.
And maybe one <unk> <unk> the name of God, and what's <unk>, and what is to do with the rest of his life?
It's hard.
This is a <unk> of the most <unk> <unk> to do in a life.
But maybe not to be so <unk> if you're not so <unk>, you're not going to be <unk>, you know, you're from you.
But I'm just going to show you data in <unk> from a <unk> of this part of your life that you have to <unk> the other <unk> when you have to <unk> the other <unk> when you have to <unk> it.
And, you know, if we think about this way.
And so I started <unk>, and it's a <unk> as I <unk> for different months in the book, the book that I'm going to <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>,
And what I have to <unk> when I'm going to <unk>, I'm not <unk> to <unk>.
<unk>. <unk> <unk> just your work.
<unk> to <unk> to <unk> your part, any of your part.
If your work is <unk>, <unk>.
If you're <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> some kind of <unk> <unk>, to a <unk> moment through your <unk>, "<unk>!" "<unk>!" "" <unk>! "
<unk>, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you do you know, you know, you do you know, you know, you know, you know, you
And "<unk>!" <unk>! "
I think and I think it's <unk>.
"<unk>!" <unk>, I'm just just to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk>: <unk>!
You know, I've been about some of these <unk> on the human <unk>, on the <unk> of new <unk> of new <unk>.
Now we're going to <unk> a new <unk>, we started <unk> to <unk> the <unk> and now now now, we're <unk> in a new <unk> of <unk>, and <unk> life.
We have been trying to <unk> big questions.
"<unk> is life?" It's something that many <unk> are <unk> to understand to understand.
We've been different <unk> <unk>, <unk> to <unk> <unk>.
We're <unk> from <unk> 20 years.
When we <unk> the human <unk> <unk> to <unk> the world of the world in the world in the <unk>.
Now, we <unk>: We can <unk> life, or create a new life from this universe?
This is the map of a little <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, which is the <unk> in the most of the <unk> in the <unk>.
And we've got to <unk> <unk> the <unk> to <unk> the <unk> to <unk> a little bit.
We're able to <unk> a <unk> of <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> that are here.
But when you look at his <unk> <unk>, it's <unk>, it's <unk> to our <unk>.
<unk>, this is simple.
But when we look at all the <unk> that we can <unk>, one time, one, it's very <unk> that this can <unk> to a <unk>.
So I <unk> that the only <unk> was <unk> this <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> of these <unk> to <unk> the <unk> of these <unk>.
And so we started <unk> <unk> <unk>? "
Is the <unk> <unk> of these big <unk> that we never never <unk> to create before you have been to create before?
And, in <unk> <unk>, we can <unk> a <unk>?
A <unk> is just a piece of <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> that we are able to <unk> life life is <unk> to <unk>.
The ability to <unk> the <unk> <unk>, instead of <unk>, instead of <unk>, <unk>,
And our most <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We have <unk> more than 15 years ago.
The process has <unk> many <unk>, with a <unk> <unk> before <unk> <unk> that <unk> the first <unk>.
But we found that that we were very difficult to be very difficult.
There are <unk> of thousands of <unk> <unk> <unk>, and the world that <unk> <unk> of <unk>, <unk> <unk>, and a <unk> process, and a <unk> process.
We had to be to <unk> a new <unk> to <unk> these <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
And this was our first <unk>, to <unk> <unk>, to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's a little little <unk> that we're <unk>.
We have <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> a <unk> of DNA <unk> <unk>.
The interesting part is when we have this piece of <unk> <unk> <unk> and we <unk> the <unk> in the <unk>, the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk>.
The <unk> are <unk> from <unk> <unk>, are <unk> from the <unk> and they're <unk> <unk> and they're <unk> <unk>.
I talked about about the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> that they have been <unk> this model.
They have <unk> more than you.
And I think this is a <unk> that we can really be <unk> to build the same <unk> in a <unk> system.
But I'm going to do the things in big.
We have to build the whole <unk> of <unk>.
I'm more than <unk> <unk> <unk>.
So we thought, we thought about <unk> <unk> <unk>, so that we can change the <unk> to understand what the <unk> are <unk> to understand what the <unk> of a <unk>.
The <unk> is <unk>, and if you <unk> information in a computer, they have to be very <unk>.
When I <unk> this is a <unk> time in the <unk> <unk> was a <unk> of a <unk> <unk>.
We found, <unk>, 30. If you're not <unk> that <unk> <unk> that <unk> never <unk> to do it.
A part of the process is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> all of the <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> here.
You know, you know that we're going to be <unk> of <unk>.
<unk> <unk>: We have a <unk> <unk> on four <unk>: <unk>, <unk>, <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
<unk> of those <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> about 20 <unk>, and there's a <unk> of <unk> <unk> to <unk> every <unk>.
So we can use the <unk> <unk> for <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
What we did we did at the beginning was <unk>.
Some of the fact, they were <unk> from <unk>.
We have <unk> these <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk>.
There are <unk> that <unk> and <unk> them.
And we started <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk>.
For every step we have <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> <unk>, and we're <unk> to create a very <unk> as a <unk>.
We're trying to <unk> the process.
So, this seems to <unk> a <unk> of a <unk> <unk>.
When I <unk> to these <unk> very <unk>, more than 100 <unk>, not more than a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's <unk> to <unk> the <unk> of <unk>.
So we've got to <unk> other <unk>.
<unk> of another <unk> called <unk> <unk>, which in our <unk>, that in our <unk> <unk>, you can <unk> the <unk> of the <unk>.
Here's a example.
This is <unk>, called <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> million <unk> <unk> <unk>.
You can see in the <unk> <unk> as his <unk> <unk>.
In 12 -- hours is <unk> as a <unk> like,
<unk> thousands of that that are able to do that.
These are <unk> <unk>.
We live in <unk> <unk>.
I'm not not not sure life life in space, and you're going to find new <unk> <unk> of water.
<unk>, the real, the <unk> has <unk>.
This is a image of <unk> that we've been <unk> with these <unk>, as as the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This image was not <unk> with a <unk> <unk>, but with a <unk> <unk>.
It's a <unk> <unk> so big that we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk>.
These are a picture that I'm going to be a <unk> of about six hours.
This is the <unk> <unk> that we did a time ago.
I'm more than <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's the most <unk> of a <unk> <unk> <unk> from a <unk> <unk>.
It's a <unk> <unk> <unk> million.
If you <unk> with a <unk> <unk> <unk>, we <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Now, how do we do it?
<unk>, at a <unk> is a <unk> <unk>.
It's a little bit more <unk> when you're <unk> <unk>.
It's more simple when it's <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> as our <unk>: you can just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> a <unk> of <unk>.
In <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is a <unk> in the <unk>, but we <unk> <unk> that we're going to do a <unk> <unk> from a <unk> <unk> from a <unk> <unk>.
We <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> from a <unk> <unk>.
The two are different different as men from <unk>.
We have <unk> <unk> <unk> in the most <unk> that we can do to do this <unk>.
And then <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk> in the way to <unk> all <unk>.
And when we <unk> <unk> in the <unk> was <unk> and <unk> our <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> our <unk> <unk>.
And <unk> <unk> that you don't go to, but we've got to <unk> more in the more in there.
This is one of the <unk> of evolution.
We found that we found that <unk> a second or a third <unk> from some part, in a second <unk> of new <unk> <unk>.
So who think about evolution as a <unk> <unk> to the time that you're not not <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> of DNA.
The <unk> that was in the <unk> never <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> that we <unk> <unk>.
It's <unk>, and he <unk> the other <unk> as <unk>, <unk>, he was <unk>, and we are <unk> with the new and the new <unk>.
It's a blue <unk> because of the <unk> that we <unk>.
And in a little bit of time, all the <unk> of a kind of a kind of a <unk> of all of all in a new <unk>, on a new species, in a new <unk> in the new <unk>.
All of the <unk> are <unk>, and when they're <unk>, and when you <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Now, this could <unk> <unk> <unk>, but <unk> the <unk> of the <unk>, we can change the things in <unk>.
Now, I've been <unk> that here is not about <unk> -- but of <unk> <unk>, and a <unk> of the <unk> of years, and a new <unk> of evolution, and I said that maybe we're not not a new <unk> of <unk> <unk> in new <unk>.
Why do do what?
I think it's enough, when we think about our <unk> <unk>.
We're going to to six billion and a half of people to <unk> <unk> in the next years.
So, to give a example: I'm I'm <unk> in <unk>.
Now, there are three people on the planet for <unk>, in <unk> <unk>, in <unk> years, there are four years.
We're going to find <unk> problems, water and <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, and a half of people.
It's more <unk> to do it for <unk> billion.
<unk> <unk> billion billion billion billion billion billion <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
That's a <unk> million <unk> to <unk>.
When we look at <unk> <unk>, or any kind of <unk>, or any kind of process to <unk>, it's going to find a huge challenge.
In the most <unk> we have to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> in the atmosphere.
And I'm going to to <unk> <unk> to <unk> in the world, we have a <unk> with <unk> million <unk>, and I like that <unk> to think that the <unk> of the future.
The industry <unk> <unk> <unk> just a <unk> of <unk>, and think about how how many different things are <unk> out.
Our <unk> are data here is data from our <unk> and from our <unk>.
Now we have <unk>, for <unk> <unk> <unk>, and we're able to create what we call <unk> <unk>.
We're able to build a big <unk> that can make a million <unk> <unk> to <unk>.
Think of these million <unk> of these million or <unk> of <unk> <unk>, and to <unk> <unk> <unk>, new <unk>, new <unk>, we can change, and more <unk> in the <unk>, and more <unk> to be more <unk>.
And it's just a <unk> <unk>.
We can have to <unk> to <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This is a <unk> of some <unk> <unk> that we are working to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
Well, we don't know how we're not.
We know what's their <unk>.
Now we're <unk> on <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
You've seen you know that <unk> <unk> from <unk> was a <unk> experiment.
We have <unk> <unk> of second and the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk>, and the <unk> of <unk>.
But the only way we think that we can have a big <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the food and <unk> would be <unk> the <unk> of the <unk>, that we're working working on the <unk> that we're working working on the <unk>, and we think we think we think we think we think we think we think we think we're talking about the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The <unk> <unk> <unk> with the <unk> is a <unk> <unk> but in our world, we found different <unk>.
This is a <unk> <unk> that we <unk> in <unk>.
<unk> in the ocean, about <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> water.
<unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of energy as <unk>.
We're trying to understand if we can <unk> the <unk> <unk>, which can be <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> that <unk> <unk>, to <unk>, to <unk> this process.
And we think about a lot that we can be able to <unk> what the question is the question of the <unk> of the <unk>.
<unk>. If you can't do do it from TED, where you can't?
It's a <unk> of energy.
<unk>, we're working working to use <unk> <unk> to create <unk> <unk>.
You've seen this year with <unk>, we're always <unk> to a year and a <unk> in a <unk> in the right.
I think that you can change <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk>.
Here's how the future could be <unk>, now, now, the <unk> of evolution, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, and <unk>.
We're so so much from people.
Our is to do in the way to live enough to live enough to live. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
<unk>, all of the <unk>, the most of the <unk>, and some of the new technology that we have to <unk> in a year.
It's a <unk> in the environment that you can <unk> a <unk> of the <unk> that you can <unk> a huge <unk> of data data.
Here we are <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk>, to a <unk> <unk>, to a <unk> <unk>, to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> as we want to <unk> them to <unk> as a <unk> <unk>,
And not know how much much much about information information information that we see, how much much of data or the <unk> of data or the <unk>.
Most of the most of <unk>, but this is a <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, and <unk> in the <unk> of <unk>.
It's not not not a difference because the only thing that <unk> the <unk> of a system as this is a <unk> of your <unk> on your <unk>. It's also a very <unk>.
This is a whole book, example of this is not <unk> of them.
This is <unk> <unk> <unk>. Every <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk>.
And I think it's a <unk> of <unk> and not <unk> of <unk>, we can do a <unk> thing, to see that it's a real <unk> of the <unk> of a <unk>.
It could be a way to be a little bit to <unk> a book.
I don't know <unk>.
This is a more <unk> example. It's a number of a number of the <unk>.
Every image is the big <unk>.
And I'm really really <unk> and the <unk> experience to <unk>, or a little bit of a <unk> or a <unk>, which is for nature of nature.
We also also also also <unk> with the <unk> of this number in particular <unk>.
We've got a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. It's <unk> in a <unk> <unk>, and you have <unk> to <unk> <unk>.
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk>, you can see here.
Or other <unk>, or even <unk> <unk>.
And this really <unk> <unk> some ideas to <unk> the <unk> of these ideas to <unk> the <unk>.
<unk> that's this <unk> <unk> to <unk> and other <unk>, not more <unk> to be <unk>.
Well, the <unk> is a more <unk> for this kind of <unk> to this kind of technology.
And on this is not to do time, if we don't have to say that, we have <unk> to be in this <unk>.
These are all the <unk> in the United States in the United States in the <unk>.
So now I'm going to do something.
This is actually actually <unk> in the <unk>, you can <unk>.
It's a project called <unk>, which <unk> two different technologies.
A <unk> is <unk> and other is a very <unk> <unk>, a very interesting <unk> <unk>, one of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk>, with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And it's <unk> in the <unk>, <unk> from <unk>.
You can <unk> when we do this kind of <unk>, where we can <unk> a image of experience, and we have this kind of experience.
But the <unk> <unk> of images here has actually a <unk>.
<unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>, and they <unk> these <unk> of these <unk>, in the <unk> that <unk> all of the <unk> <unk> on <unk> <unk> on <unk> <unk> <unk> on <unk> <unk> on <unk> <unk>. And so you see, or <unk> of <unk>, and these things are <unk>, and these things that are <unk> of <unk>.
I don't know if I've got to show you some of you.
There's some very much more <unk>.
I want to go to a <unk> of data <unk> and this <unk> <unk> from a <unk> <unk> <unk> that we did for the time to the time to the time, to show you what we did the first time to show you. And the <unk> of technology, and the <unk> is <unk>. And so much of the <unk>. And we have been <unk>.
We had to <unk> <unk> and on.
This is a <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>, and <unk> of the <unk> of these <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> of these <unk> <unk>.
So I'm all <unk> <unk> from <unk> and they're all <unk> to <unk> at the <unk>.
And it's possible to this way.
You know, I never thought, I would not be <unk> to work to work.
It's very <unk> <unk> this kind of <unk> here.
I think I think that's a lot of a lot of different different <unk>: from the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk>, a number number of the environment.
And if I can <unk>, I can <unk> to <unk> those more <unk>.
Many are <unk> from <unk>, <unk>.
<unk> some part here is a series of <unk> -- <unk>.
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We can go from the <unk> of this environment.
The point is that we can do about things with the environment. This is now now now now is now <unk> data from the <unk> of the <unk>, the <unk> of <unk>, and <unk> all of <unk>.
All of these are <unk> <unk>, more <unk> of the <unk>.
You have a model of the <unk> of the <unk>.
Think about this as <unk> <unk> on the work of <unk> on Earth <unk>.
It's something that <unk> in <unk> <unk>, who <unk> people are <unk>, and the <unk> that <unk> <unk> with <unk>.
<unk> their picture, I'm <unk> with <unk> <unk> from other people.
If somebody is the idea of <unk> all these <unk> <unk> <unk> the name, my picture, my picture of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of all of all of all of all of all of all of the <unk>, and the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk>, and <unk> of <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and the <unk> of <unk>, and <unk> of <unk>, and <unk> <unk> of <unk> of <unk>, and <unk>,
Well, a <unk> of all of all of all of all of the <unk> of every interesting interesting interesting <unk>, and <unk> <unk> from <unk> and <unk>, but <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
Thank you.
Chris: I do it right? What's what your <unk> is that your <unk> to do is that a point, in the next years, all of years, all of the world, all of you're going to be <unk>?
<unk>: Yeah. What's doing in <unk> is to <unk>.
It's a <unk> of <unk>, if you want to <unk>, between <unk>.
And it's doing the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk>.
The thing is very interesting if you think about <unk> information information of these <unk> <unk> that many <unk> of these <unk>.
As a <unk> when you're a <unk> of <unk> on the <unk>, you're going to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk>.
Now, what happens if you see if you're going to <unk> all your picture?
So, the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and the <unk> of <unk> that <unk> is really a <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk>.
CA: <unk>, it's amazing.
<unk>: I'm going to be very.
One of the <unk> when you <unk> and a <unk> of <unk> <unk> is the <unk> of the who are not <unk> the <unk> <unk>, who <unk> the <unk> <unk>, the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, the <unk> of the <unk>, the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk>, the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> think that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, or <unk> <unk> <unk>, or that <unk> are still <unk> <unk> <unk>, or <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the idea that we don't have <unk>, but we don't have a <unk> of <unk>, but we have a <unk> of <unk>, but we have a <unk> of <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk>, a particular <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> that our <unk> has done, or <unk>, many <unk> <unk>.
And, of course, all of the <unk> <unk>.
All <unk>. <unk> <unk>.
We're <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We have to <unk> <unk> <unk>, so we don't <unk> if you <unk> and <unk> --
We all have a art.
What <unk> is the <unk> is the <unk> of the <unk> of every culture.
It's not that the <unk> <unk> of the <unk>, or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, the <unk> of <unk> <unk>, or a <unk> <unk> <unk>, or a <unk> in the <unk>.
He was my <unk> to <unk> a month ago, or a month, or a month ago, <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of the world.
All these <unk> <unk> <unk> that are other ways of <unk> ways of <unk>, to think, other ways of the world.
And, if you're going to be a <unk>, it's a idea that can <unk>.
<unk>, the <unk> of the world <unk> <unk> and <unk> that <unk> <unk> and <unk> that <unk> the planet and it's important to the planet, and it's important as <unk>.
And you can think about this <unk> <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and can <unk> the <unk> <unk> of all of all the <unk> of all the <unk>, <unk>, <unk> ideas, <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>,
The <unk> is the <unk> of <unk>.
It's the <unk> of what we are and what we can be in how <unk>.
And <unk> <unk> <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> was <unk> <unk>, and <unk> very much more <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, for example, <unk> that <unk> percent of all the species was <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk>, or the <unk> of the <unk>, or <unk> -- in the <unk> -- in the <unk> -- and not <unk> -- and not <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> -- and you don't don't have more <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> of all of all is, of course, the <unk> <unk>.
When you're <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on this planet.
A language is not just <unk> from a <unk> or a <unk> of a <unk> <unk>.
One language is the human <unk>.
It's a half with the <unk> of every culture is in the world.
Every language is a <unk> of the <unk>, a <unk>, a <unk>, a <unk> of <unk>.
And of those <unk> <unk> <unk>, as we are there in <unk>, at least the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of children.
They're not not more <unk> to the children, the that you're not <unk>, who are not <unk>.
What there's more <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, the <unk> of the <unk>, to talk about a <unk> <unk>, the <unk> of the <unk> or <unk> of the <unk> of the children?
This <unk> was <unk> <unk> was a few weeks, some of every two weeks: every two weeks: every two weeks: every two weeks: every two weeks: every two weeks: every two weeks: every two weeks: every two weeks: every two weeks: every two weeks: every two weeks: every two weeks: every two weeks:
And I know somebody of you <unk> <unk>? "
The world not not a better place if you're all the same thing? "<unk>, then we're going to <unk>.
<unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> a <unk> thing to say, I don't think about your <unk>.
I'd like to do a <unk> <unk> on the <unk> --
a little <unk> on <unk> to <unk> to show you a <unk> of what we're <unk>.
Many of us to <unk> that when I say, "I mean," I mean, "I mean," I'm really different ways of us.
<unk> for example, in <unk> <unk>, in <unk> <unk>, the <unk> of <unk>, which <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's a <unk> that is not in the <unk> <unk> the blue <unk>, because the <unk> of the <unk>, from the <unk>, from the <unk>, which <unk> <unk> <unk>.
They have a <unk> <unk> and a <unk> <unk>, "<unk> <unk>" <unk>, "<unk>, you have to <unk> a different <unk>.
And that's <unk> in the past <unk>, as the <unk> is that they're in these <unk>, who are <unk> or seven <unk> <unk> <unk>, because of the <unk> <unk> one.
You're going to talk and then <unk> to me.
<unk> one of the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> that I was, the <unk> of <unk>, a <unk> that has been the <unk> in <unk>.
In <unk> five <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
They did <unk> from the <unk> that they <unk> in <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk>, <unk> that <unk> <unk> never seen.
They <unk> the picture from the <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, and they <unk>, and a <unk>, they don't <unk>, they're not <unk>, and they <unk> <unk> <unk>, and they <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
But the <unk> don't just <unk> <unk>.
They're <unk> between them.
<unk> percent of the <unk> was <unk> from their <unk>.
We <unk> <unk> <unk> and we found two <unk> of <unk>, and when we <unk> to know, they're <unk> to know, they <unk> that a <unk> of them was so <unk>, and then <unk> <unk> <unk>. And then they <unk> the same <unk>. And so we had a <unk> <unk> of <unk>.
<unk> were able to <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk>, from <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> the species.
<unk> years years, I was <unk> a really really really interesting when I was a really interesting interesting <unk>, I wanted to <unk> to <unk> <unk> to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And to give a sense of <unk>, I would have to understand what <unk> is not <unk> <unk>.
It's pretty pretty <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's interesting.
If you're going to <unk> to <unk> the world, what I'm going to me to me?
<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk>,
A continent is always always always out, which Africa is not <unk> <unk>. And instead of these <unk> is not the <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
What's interesting is <unk> <unk> is the <unk> between life and <unk>.
So the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> can be <unk> from <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> in the way that we <unk> to <unk> the <unk>.
So, the <unk> <unk> <unk>, "<unk> <unk> <unk> to talk to God.
We're <unk> in <unk> and God. "
And the moment that you're <unk>, it's the <unk> of the <unk>, how you can you, you can <unk> to you, you can <unk>, you can <unk>, you can <unk>, you can <unk>, you can <unk>, you can <unk>, you can <unk>, you can <unk>, you can <unk>, you, you can <unk>,
So, you have <unk> to these new <unk>: <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> all the <unk> of the <unk> that I <unk> the most <unk> are the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, in the <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on <unk> <unk> <unk> on <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> on <unk>.
In a continent of <unk> <unk>, this <unk> never been <unk> from <unk>.
And I'm <unk> today, I'm <unk> from a <unk>, but they're <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> are <unk> <unk> from <unk> or four or four years, and they live in a world world, and they're <unk> to <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> years.
Two years of the <unk> years <unk> <unk> <unk>. The <unk> months of <unk> that <unk> in the <unk> <unk>, now are <unk> in the <unk> of <unk>.
So, that time, they're <unk> to <unk> their <unk>, which <unk> their <unk> and just their <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or just to <unk> <unk> -- or not better to say, or <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And the <unk> of this incredible <unk>, they're <unk> out and <unk> for the first time, at the <unk> of the <unk> years, you know, a <unk> <unk>. And that I'm going to <unk> the <unk>, when the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk>,
"<unk>? <unk> <unk> how I said.
It's <unk>. Now, you're going to show you. "
They said, "<unk> and they say, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, we're <unk> <unk> of the world.
This is very important.
When we think about <unk> <unk> and the environment <unk> and the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, which is a <unk> in his <unk> or <unk>, or <unk> <unk>, and they're going to be more than us to us.
<unk> <unk> are not <unk> <unk> from <unk>.
There's not space for these things in <unk> or <unk> in the <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk>, but <unk> to the time and <unk>, they had a <unk> of <unk> on the <unk> <unk> on the <unk>, but <unk> <unk> <unk>, and more <unk> <unk>, and the <unk> <unk> that we can be a <unk> <unk>.
What is, what?
<unk>, that a <unk> <unk> of <unk> that <unk> <unk> that the <unk> is a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> is a human <unk>, and we have a different different <unk> and <unk> a different different <unk> of a different <unk> that <unk> <unk> or that a <unk> of <unk> that a <unk> that a <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
That's the <unk> of a <unk> or a <unk> <unk> is <unk>.
What is interesting is the <unk> that <unk> <unk> the <unk> between the <unk> and the world.
I'm going to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> to be <unk>.
What has a human <unk> to be different from my friends that <unk> are <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, that <unk> <unk> in the <unk>.
If you <unk> that these <unk> can create different <unk>, <unk>, <unk> to <unk> them to <unk> them.
I <unk> this picture at <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> some of you have heard about <unk> <unk>, the most <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk>.
What's really really really really really <unk> is not the <unk> of the <unk>, but his <unk>.
<unk> a side, this <unk> <unk> <unk> that has a series of <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> the only <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. It's a little bit of the <unk>, but it's <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This <unk> <unk> <unk>, very <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
If you're going to see the <unk> <unk> to the <unk> that they do a different <unk> of a different <unk>, it's <unk>.
<unk> that <unk> on <unk> <unk> is a little bit like to be <unk> from a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a <unk> of a <unk> <unk>. It's <unk> <unk>. It's <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, the <unk> was <unk>, with his <unk> <unk> in the <unk> years.
My <unk>, I don't <unk> these <unk> as <unk>, because if you're not going to tell you you to be <unk>. And they're not <unk>. They're not <unk> to be <unk> because they're not <unk> <unk>, which is <unk> by a <unk> that, and <unk> <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>.
It's possible <unk> <unk>, if you're going to be <unk> with other <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk>.
Now, the <unk> is the <unk> that are in this <unk> are <unk> <unk> of the <unk>, the same <unk>. The <unk> <unk>. The question: <unk> <unk>: <unk> in a <unk> of <unk> <unk>, how to <unk> <unk>, as <unk> <unk>, but <unk> <unk>, how to <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, but <unk> <unk>, <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk>,
We use the big <unk> of <unk> and <unk>, which can <unk> <unk>.
But if you're <unk>, <unk> <unk>, "<unk> <unk> <unk>."
What is, what?
This <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, who <unk> <unk> in the <unk>, and that our <unk> <unk> in the same <unk> in the same <unk>.
If you know, <unk> as <unk> their <unk> <unk>, "<unk> <unk> <unk>," <unk>, I said, "No." "" "" "" "No."
The <unk> is, you're <unk> <unk> in a <unk> night, and <unk> <unk> <unk> with a different <unk>.
And that's not <unk> to <unk>, but it's very interesting than <unk> <unk>.
Now, <unk> <unk> <unk>, and the problem is that they have to <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, but in some way to the story of the history of the history of our <unk>, and <unk>.
In fact, the <unk> century, between years, <unk>, not <unk> to his <unk> or his <unk> <unk>, but as the <unk> was that we were in <unk> or <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk>. And the planet. And the <unk> of the <unk>. And the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk>.
All of the <unk> are <unk> in a <unk> <unk> for new <unk> to <unk>.
And the problem is not technology.
<unk> <unk> <unk>, they don't have <unk> to be <unk> when they <unk> <unk> and so <unk> as <unk> <unk>, they were <unk> when they <unk> <unk>, they <unk> to be part of <unk> and <unk>.
It's not the change or technology that <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And if you're going to be a <unk> of the world, I'm not <unk> to <unk>.
They're <unk> and <unk> <unk> out of the <unk> <unk> that they're <unk> to their <unk> to <unk>.
<unk> that <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> of <unk> --
a <unk> <unk> <unk>, in <unk> <unk>, a <unk> that has been <unk> in the <unk> in a generation, and now <unk> to a generation ago, and <unk> to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk>, where you can see the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk>, where the <unk> of a <unk>, where the <unk> of the <unk>, where the <unk>, where the <unk> of the <unk>, where the <unk>, where the <unk>, where the <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, where
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> the <unk> <unk> to the <unk>.
Or, in the case of the <unk>, are <unk> with the <unk> of <unk>.
If we <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk>, where I'm doing a lot of <unk>, you see the <unk> of <unk>.
As <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> is <unk>, it's <unk> to <unk>, but <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, the <unk> of life, not just <unk>, not just <unk>, but not just <unk>, <unk>, because of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>, because of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, because of <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And you can't understand <unk> <unk> <unk>.
I <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> in the <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk>, but just <unk> to <unk> a <unk>, but just to <unk> <unk> that's the <unk> of <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> million people <unk> from <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The father was <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> that's <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> that has <unk> to <unk>.
<unk> mother was <unk> and his <unk> was <unk>.
It was been been been been <unk> in <unk> <unk>, in the <unk> of two years, because he didn't have to be <unk>.
<unk>, <unk>, he was <unk> <unk> in the same, was <unk> in the <unk> of <unk>.
A day day has <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> and, for this <unk>, was <unk> to <unk> <unk> to <unk> years.
<unk> <unk> can be <unk>, but the <unk> of the <unk> is from <unk>.
And then, all, all of a <unk>.
<unk> live in the world <unk> or we want to be <unk> the world of the <unk>?
The big <unk> <unk> <unk>, before he said, before he said that her <unk> was that, in our <unk>, in our <unk> of the world, not just <unk> the world, not just <unk> the <unk> of human <unk> of human <unk>, but a <unk> of <unk>, a day.
And it's <unk> to <unk> that our species is <unk> for <unk> years.
The <unk> <unk>, that <unk> <unk>, which has been <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> with <unk>, and <unk> <unk> of <unk>, and we're <unk> of <unk>, and we're <unk> <unk> years ago.
The <unk> world has been <unk> to <unk> years.
The <unk> story not <unk> me that we have to all the most <unk> that we have to <unk> in <unk>.
When I'm going to <unk> of the world is, I mean, <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And it's in these <unk> that all of what we all <unk> to be, that we have to be a kind of <unk>, that all of the way that all of all of the <unk>. And there are very very very <unk>.
I <unk> this picture on the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk>, when I went to <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk>, and this <unk>, I was <unk>, and this <unk> story of his <unk>.
The government <unk> was not always <unk> with the <unk> and <unk> in the years to <unk> our <unk>, we have <unk> <unk>, we have <unk> in <unk>.
The <unk> of this man was <unk> <unk>.
The family, <unk> for his life, <unk> all of his life, and all his <unk>.
You know that <unk> don't <unk> the <unk>, the <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> were <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> of this man was not <unk> from night or <unk> from the <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's <unk>, it's <unk>, it's <unk>, and <unk> in your <unk>. When I <unk> <unk>, I'm <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, the <unk> has <unk> a <unk>.
It's <unk> <unk> on <unk> <unk>, and when <unk> <unk>, he <unk>, he was a <unk>.
It's <unk> the <unk> and a <unk>, with the <unk> <unk> <unk> has a <unk>, <unk> a <unk> <unk>, and it's <unk> on <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> to talk about <unk> <unk>. And this, and this, and this, <unk> is the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the world.
<unk> <unk> <unk> the government <unk> has <unk> to the <unk> of a <unk> area of a <unk> area of the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk>.
It's their new <unk>. It's called <unk>.
It's a <unk> <unk> <unk>. <unk> all the <unk> <unk>.
One example of how a <unk> can <unk> with his <unk>.
And, to <unk>, I think it's pretty <unk> at least who are in these <unk> of the planet, <unk> that they're not not not <unk>.
And somebody's home.
<unk> <unk> <unk> of human <unk>, and for us to <unk>, and for all of these children, as the <unk> of our children, as the children, they're <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
For, we have <unk> <unk> <unk>, we're not <unk> to <unk>.
<unk> that <unk> --
<unk> <unk> <unk>, but we're not <unk>, but we're going to change the world, and maybe we're going to tell the world about the world, and maybe our world <unk> million <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> our <unk> <unk>.
<unk> our <unk> are <unk> from million people.
Our work is <unk> in <unk> <unk> to <unk> to <unk> our <unk> in places of <unk> <unk> from <unk> from <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of <unk>, and they've seen and <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, and we have to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> and a world, and <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, and a <unk> world.
that <unk> <unk> all of all the <unk> can <unk> to our <unk> <unk>.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some things I'm going to be in this book, I hope you've heard of a <unk>, in the case, in the case, in the case, you've been <unk>, in this book, in this book, in the case,
I'd like to <unk> what I call "<unk> <unk>."
The <unk> <unk> of what?
The <unk> <unk> of all the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>: "If we want to <unk> the <unk> of our <unk> <unk> <unk>."
The reason is, from a side, in fact that <unk> is in the same <unk>, is <unk>, for <unk>, for <unk>, for <unk>.
<unk> other is in fact that if we're <unk>, each of us can do that that <unk> our <unk>, not to do that that we're not not not not one of our <unk>.
The way to <unk> <unk> is <unk>.
The <unk> people have, more <unk>, and more <unk>, and more than their <unk>, is their <unk>.
This is <unk>, <unk>, it's so <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk>.
And it's also <unk> in our lives.
I'm going to show you some of what the <unk> is.
This is my <unk>. It's not great.
I <unk> a simple simple <unk> on <unk>.
In my <unk> <unk> are <unk> <unk>, without <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that you can <unk> <unk> that you can <unk> a <unk> <unk> of <unk> in <unk> <unk> that one of your <unk>.
Here's what's the <unk>.
And then you go to <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk>.
And in this single <unk> <unk>, there's a big number of <unk>.
We can make a half and a half of different <unk> <unk> <unk> that are in a <unk>.
<unk> <unk> that there's <unk>.
<unk> <unk>: The world of the world.
A time, when I was a child, they were <unk> to <unk>, they were <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
You're <unk> the <unk>, you're not <unk>.
A <unk> of what is, between the other, was that the <unk> never <unk>.
These days, they had been.
We have a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, but in the <unk> <unk>.
Here's the <unk> of the future.
My <unk> is what in a half, <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, and <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk>.
If you're not not not <unk> in the <unk>, you're going to be <unk>.
And what's what happens is that people are in <unk> and this question, and this question question? The answer is the answer? "No."
It's not possible to do a <unk> <unk> that you don't do things.
So, in other <unk> of life that are much more important than the same <unk>, <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>: You don't have more in the United States that you have to <unk> and <unk> you to do.
Instead, <unk> from <unk>, and the <unk>, and <unk>, "OK," or <unk>, or "<unk>," <unk>, "<unk>," <unk>, and these <unk> and these <unk> and <unk>. "
You know, "<unk>, what do do?"
And the <unk> said, "<unk> has these <unk> and these <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk> these <unk> and <unk> these <unk>."
"What do you want to do?"
And you're <unk>, "<unk> if she was, what?"
And the <unk> <unk>, "But I'm not."
The <unk> <unk> <unk> "<unk> <unk>," <unk> that's <unk>, <unk> that's a <unk> thing.
But in fact, it's not that a <unk> <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk>, who know, <unk> <unk>, to <unk> the <unk>, and <unk>, it's not not not not not not not not not not not not not <unk> -- and so in the <unk>.
There's a huge <unk> of <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk> people like me, and you, you know, if you think, you know, because it's not <unk>.
But if you don't <unk>, why do we <unk> them?
The answer is that they want to <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, so much as a <unk> is our <unk>, as a <unk> of <unk>, as you see the <unk> of the <unk>. "You're not going to be <unk> the <unk>." We're not going to be <unk>.
And we can <unk> them them.
The <unk> that means that every <unk>, you have to <unk>, you know, you want to be.
<unk>, the family and <unk>, a time the <unk> of <unk>, <unk> to any <unk> of people, and they were <unk> the <unk>, and you can <unk> the kids to be <unk>.
The only <unk> was with who, who didn't know what I don't know, and I don't know what I'm not going to do.
<unk>, all, it's really really <unk>.
<unk> to the students, and <unk> their <unk>, and <unk> their <unk> in less than a time.
And because they don't have less <unk>, because they're not not <unk>.
but why I'm <unk>, <unk> <unk>, "<unk> or not?" <unk> or not? "
"<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. I'm going to be before to the children or <unk>?"
I'm <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And they're going to to be to these questions, even if this <unk> <unk>, and they don't have a <unk> <unk> to my <unk>.
And they have to do it.
Now, the work: we're <unk>, as <unk> <unk>, because the technology of work, every day, every day, from every day, from the planet, that that <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, there's a <unk>, and I don't know what it's not to you know.
I'm not going to show you, because I want to do.
What means, this incredible <unk> of <unk>, we have about the work? It's what we have to do, if we have to work, or not.
We can go to see our <unk>, with the <unk>, with the <unk> in a <unk>, and the <unk>, and <unk>, on the <unk>.
And if I'm all <unk>, every day that we see, every day that we're <unk>, "What do I'm going to be to this?"
"" I'm going to to do you to do this <unk>? "
And when the answer is not, "Well, this is not, all of your <unk> <unk> of your <unk>.
So, from any part, and big things, and big, and <unk> of life, life, life is a question of <unk>.
A time the world was this: <unk>, there were some <unk>, but not all of a <unk>. But it was a question.
The world of today today today, <unk> is, "<unk> is," <unk>, or <unk>? "
The answer is <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> <unk> them, so I'm going to talk about the <unk>.
<unk> this is a <unk> two <unk>, in people.
The first, <unk>, it's that <unk> <unk>.
And so we're going to be very difficult to do.
I'm going to show a <unk> example, one of <unk> <unk> <unk>.
A <unk> <unk> had to <unk> data, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, with a million <unk> <unk> in different <unk> <unk> in different <unk>.
What she was was that that for every 10 <unk> that are <unk> in the most <unk>, the <unk> of the two percent.
<unk> <unk> <unk>, there's 10 percent in less than <unk> to <unk> when they are only <unk> to <unk>. Why?
Because with 50 <unk> in the <unk> that you have to be hard, and <unk> is <unk> to <unk>.
And I <unk>, and still still <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and of course, you don't have been.
<unk> that's not just that these <unk> from <unk> <unk>, because they don't have enough enough, you want to say that the <unk> is so <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk>.
<unk>, they're <unk>, they're <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> for the <unk> of work, who would be <unk> to <unk>.
So the <unk> is a <unk> of <unk> to have <unk> <unk>.
And I think I <unk> the world.
"And for <unk>, to <unk> <unk>, <unk> or <unk>?"
<unk> <unk>, to do the right right, if it's the right?
You don't want to <unk> the <unk> and <unk> the <unk> <unk>.
So this is the first <unk>. The second is that if we can <unk> <unk> and do a <unk>, at the end of how to <unk>, we're <unk> from the <unk> of how to be less <unk> in the <unk>.
And this for different reasons.
One of these is that with many <unk> in the <unk> that you can't have a lot of <unk>, it's not a different <unk> that could be a different <unk>. And that's better. And that's <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, and <unk> the <unk> of <unk>, and <unk> the <unk> of the <unk>, and <unk>, and the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk>,
And when it was a <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> are, more than you're more than you're <unk> to <unk>.
<unk>, there's what <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> has <unk> very <unk>, as the <unk> that we do things from what we do with what <unk>.
<unk>, when there are many <unk>, it's <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, is much <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> that's <unk> of <unk> that is.
Here's a example. I'm not not not about New York.
But it's what you know.
There's this <unk> <unk>.
A place of <unk>.
<unk> <unk>. <unk> <unk>. It's all of them.
It's not not that. But that he said, "Well, <unk>, it's <unk>."
"<unk> my <unk> are on <unk>."
"<unk> <unk> <unk>."
And in two weeks weeks weeks weeks from the idea that's <unk> -- every day -- every day -- every day -- every day -- every day -- every day -- every day -- every day -- every day -- every day -- every day -- every day -- every day -- every day -- every day -- every day -- every day -- every day -- every day -- every day -- every day -- every day -- every day -- every day -- every day -- every day -- every day -- every
The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> for that we have, when the <unk> was <unk>.
And more are the <unk> that we have <unk>, more <unk> <unk> <unk>, and more <unk> <unk>.
Here's another example.
This <unk> said, so many things.
And maybe about a live, and maybe a live in <unk>.
But the most important is that any important is that you're going to do the other.
The things that's not <unk> have a lot of <unk> that can make less <unk> what we do.
<unk> <unk> <unk>. <unk> <unk> <unk>.
I've been on my <unk> <unk> a new <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk>.
A time, the <unk> were a kind of <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, just after <unk>, and <unk> a lot of <unk>, and a lot of <unk>, to go to <unk>.
So, I <unk> to <unk> a new when they were <unk>, they were <unk>, and I said, "I said," I said, "I'm my <unk>."
The <unk> said, "<unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>?"
And I want to <unk> or <unk>? "<unk>?" <unk> or <unk>? "
"Do you want to <unk>?"
"<unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk>? <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> --" <unk> <unk> <unk>.
I was <unk>, and after a little little bit of what I'm going to say, "I want to say," I'm not not a <unk>. I'm not so so <unk>. I was so <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>,
It was <unk>. It was <unk>.
But I'm going to be <unk>.
Why? I said a whole book for <unk>.
The reason I was not not <unk> with all of the <unk>, the <unk> were <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
I had <unk> <unk> <unk>. I didn't <unk> me when I'm not just a kind of <unk>, when they're going to be a <unk> of a <unk>, a kind of <unk>, a <unk> had to be.
What I was <unk> was a good, but not a <unk>.
And then I was <unk> what I was <unk> in <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> of <unk> in life life, not ago that <unk> <unk> that these are <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>.
And this <unk> <unk> <unk>, even when the <unk> are good.
<unk> in the world if you're going to do.
Because if I'm not <unk>, I'm talking about what I'm talking about.
The <unk> of the most <unk>.
"You know, he was better when he was <unk>," The reason that was better when he was <unk>.
<unk>, in the world we live -- <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> that we can <unk> the things are in the <unk>.
You've never never <unk> <unk> because your <unk>, my <unk>, my <unk>, my <unk>, and my <unk>, I'm <unk>.
The <unk> of happiness -- what you're here -- that's, "Yeah, you want to <unk>." Yeah, you want to you. "
I mean -- I'm really <unk> <unk> -- that I'm really <unk> and my wife is really <unk>.
I didn't have to do better, I'm not <unk>.
But I'm not not a <unk> thing.
<unk>, a <unk> of a couple of <unk> <unk> when there's just that kind of <unk> is that when you're not just <unk>, and you're not not <unk>, and you're not just <unk>, and you know? "
"Who's <unk>?" "" "" <unk> is <unk>.
The world is <unk>. What I could do I'm going to do?
When there are hundreds of kinds of <unk> <unk>, and <unk> a <unk>, and you <unk> to you who's <unk>, and you're <unk>, you're <unk>.
I could be better better.
And we were <unk>, we're not <unk> for <unk>.
So when people are <unk>, even if the <unk> is <unk>, you know, they're <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> their same.
In the last years <unk> is <unk> in the world.
I think a <unk> <unk> -- not the only only <unk> -- but important -- I'm not not the people to be too <unk> because the <unk> are too <unk>.
And when they have to <unk> this is their <unk>.
So the end of the end is that we're going to be better, but we're going to be <unk>.
I'm going to show you.
This is the <unk> <unk>, what we're going to do and it's <unk>.
There's not no <unk> that a little bit of the <unk> is better than that we don't have a lot of a little bit.
There's a <unk> <unk>, <unk>. I don't know what it's.
But I'm sure we <unk> from a piece of a piece of the <unk> that the <unk> of our life.
Now, from the point of <unk> -- I'm <unk> -- from the <unk>, the <unk> is the <unk> <unk>.
What we're all this is the <unk> of the <unk> is <unk>.
There are many places in the world, and you're <unk> <unk>, in the problem is not that have <unk> <unk>.
The problem is that they're too <unk>.
And so I'm talking about is a <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And that's <unk> and <unk> is this: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, you've got to <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> to <unk>.
I mean, these <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, it's not that are just <unk>.
I'm <unk> <unk> <unk>.
They do it.
If a little bit of what our society is <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk>. And the people have too <unk> to be a lot of their life, not just their life, but our life to be our life.
This is what <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
A <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> -- not just to the <unk> -- because of this <unk> <unk> <unk> that we're <unk>.
And as "<unk>," <unk>, you can be all that you want to be all of what you want to be all.
<unk>, people, <unk>, <unk>, "But what <unk> <unk>?"
"It's <unk> that you can't do it in a <unk> of <unk>."
"A <unk>, a <unk> <unk> <unk> of the world --"
and I <unk> I <unk> this, at the beginning.
But then, <unk>, <unk>, instead of me that that that <unk> was the <unk>.
Because the fact of the <unk> is that if you're <unk> in <unk>, in <unk>, and so that it's not <unk>.
If you <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk>. And we <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk>.
They need to need a <unk>.
This is almost almost too <unk>, maybe for the fish, maybe for the fish, and <unk> for us.
But the <unk> of some <unk> <unk> is a <unk> for <unk> and <unk>, <unk>, to <unk> <unk>.
Thank you.
