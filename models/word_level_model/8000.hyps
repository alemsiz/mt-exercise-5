And last year I showed these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, which <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, for almost three million years, had the size of the United States, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, which is
And this <unk> the <unk> of the problem because it's not shows the ice.
<unk> <unk> <unk> is, in a way, the heart of global global global system.
It's <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
The next next <unk> is going to be a <unk> <unk> on the last 25 years.
<unk> <unk> are <unk> in red.
You see, you're <unk> to the blue <unk>.
That's the ice in <unk>, which is <unk> <unk> in summer.
You can see that the <unk> ice <unk>, of five years, is like the blood, which here is like the blood, which here is as the blood <unk>, which is like the blood <unk>, you can see that the <unk> ice <unk> from the body.
<unk> years, it's been so, so.
This is a problem because the <unk> are interested in the ocean <unk>, where there are huge <unk> of <unk> <unk>, <unk>, are <unk> in <unk> <unk>.
<unk> to the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>, that <unk> <unk>, that <unk> <unk> this point of not <unk>.
In some <unk> <unk> <unk> is already <unk> from the water.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with a <unk> team <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>! <unk>: <unk>! <unk>: She's good. The question is if we're <unk> it also.
And one reason is that this <unk> <unk> <unk> from the north.
This is a <unk> <unk>.
<unk> had never <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This is the <unk> <unk>, in the <unk> of <unk>.
If you want to know how it's <unk> the <unk> <unk> on <unk> <unk>, here's where the sea.
These <unk> are <unk>.
And on the planet, <unk>, the largest <unk> of the planet.
<unk> month last month, the <unk> scientists who <unk> the <unk> of the ice is in <unk>, and the <unk> <unk> on some <unk> <unk>, is particularly <unk> in <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk>, like <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, you know, the largest <unk> <unk>, you see new <unk>, which a few years ago, they were <unk>.
40 percent of the world population <unk> half of the <unk> water from that <unk>.
<unk> <unk>: this <unk> is the water <unk> of the <unk> of the water <unk> of this city.
<unk> is <unk>.
But when you <unk>, the same happens to the water.
<unk> California <unk> on the <unk> <unk> is <unk> of 40 percent.
<unk> <unk> are in the crisis.
<unk>, as you read, they're <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> in the world to a <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> are <unk> to a <unk> out of the normal and <unk>.
<unk> times over the last 30 years, than the <unk> <unk>.
This is a <unk> of the <unk>.
If you look in the context of the <unk>, you can see the <unk>.
In the last five years, we have <unk> <unk> <unk> million <unk> in the ocean every day.
Look at the <unk> <unk>, from <unk>, from <unk>, to <unk>, and both the parts of the <unk> <unk>, where there's a <unk> <unk> <unk> of oxygen in the oceans.
The <unk> of global <unk>, together to <unk>, which is 20 percent, is the use of <unk> <unk>.
<unk> is a problem, and the <unk> is even worse.
The United States are one of the two countries with <unk> emissions, together.
And they <unk> to build a lot of other <unk>.
But we're <unk> to a <unk> of the direction.
These are the <unk> projects in the last years and some <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
And so, there's a <unk> <unk> in our country.
<unk> <unk> and oil <unk> <unk> <unk> million dollars in the last year to <unk> <unk> <unk>, which is a <unk>.
And I <unk> image to me --
<unk> <unk>, in <unk>, where I live, there was a <unk> of <unk> billion <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
You know, you saw it on the <unk>.
This is the second largest <unk> <unk> <unk> in America.
It's happened around <unk>.
<unk> <unk> of one of the <unk> <unk> was this.
<unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk> is a <unk> <unk> and happy.
It's <unk> in America, and it's <unk> in America, and it's our economy.
<unk> the <unk> is more <unk>.
It's <unk>, <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> here is a lot of the <unk> <unk>.
The largest <unk> society on the <unk> is <unk>. This is his <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk> -- Al <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> -- they don't know what they're talking about.
<unk>: So <unk> for <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This is a one of them, a part.
<unk>: <unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk>, we see the <unk> changes as a <unk> <unk> in our business.
So, we have a big amount of money in a big <unk> in a <unk> <unk> to make public and <unk> the truth on <unk>.
In fact, <unk> is not <unk>.
We think it's <unk> -- it's also a good <unk>.
So, we don't have to <unk> of climate change.
We're going to do.
<unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk> -- you've heard a lot of you.
So I <unk> a <unk> <unk> structure to <unk> as much as <unk> <unk>.
<unk>! <unk> are a little <unk>, but this is the sound of technology <unk>.
<unk> <unk> is between the <unk> <unk> of global <unk>, but the <unk> technology of <unk> <unk> that you see everything.
And I look at a: this is the <unk> technology of <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to the <unk> to the <unk> and the national security.
<unk>: <unk>: <unk> <unk>, the national security <unk>, the national security <unk>, the national <unk> crisis.
The <unk> that the <unk> all of our <unk> from <unk> <unk>, as <unk> <unk> and oil <unk>.
Now, but there's a new <unk>, <unk> solution to <unk>.
<unk> America: 100 percent of <unk> energy, in 10 years.
A plan to <unk> America to work, <unk> more <unk>, and help <unk> global warming.
<unk>, a solution that we <unk> to solve our problems.
<unk> America. <unk> of more.
<unk>: This is the last.
<unk>: <unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk> to America.
One of the most <unk> ways of <unk> <unk> to <unk> from the <unk> that we <unk> our planet.
<unk>: The future is here. <unk>, <unk>, a new <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>: <unk> <unk> for jobs <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> America. It's time to be <unk>.
<unk>: A old <unk> <unk> says, "If you you want to go to <unk>, you go from the.
If you want to go, you go together. "
We have to go away, quickly.
Thank you very much.
<unk> year I did an <unk> on <unk>.
And they <unk> to <unk> on how it works.
So, here's. And for those who was no one, the <unk> is the largest <unk> <unk> experiment. <unk> is the largest <unk> experiment.
His task is to <unk> the conditions that were <unk> less than a <unk> <unk> of a second from the universe -- until <unk> million times a second.
All that's just <unk>.
This is the machine <unk>.
So, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you
This is what work. It's called <unk> -- it's <unk> <unk> <unk> feet and he has a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This is a picture of <unk> <unk> in building, you can see the <unk>.
<unk> 10 <unk> year, we <unk> the car for the first time.
And this picture was <unk> by <unk>.
It was <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk>.
It's an image of the first <unk> of particles that had done all the <unk> of <unk>, <unk>, with a part of <unk>, and <unk> particles in the <unk>.
In other words, when I <unk> that image the <unk>, which the <unk> machine, which is a big <unk>.
I don't know if it was this to <unk> about more or this, when somebody <unk> on Google and <unk> that the <unk> <unk> was this.
That means we have had a <unk> impact on the scientific <unk>.
And a week later, there was a problem with the machine, we had a problem with the machine, and this <unk>.
These <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> when the machine works at the <unk> <unk>.
Now, the <unk> between you <unk> and <unk>, "It's not true. I'm too <unk>."
And instead they can do it because when they're very <unk> <unk> <unk>.
So, <unk> degrees, at a <unk> temperature <unk> to that the space between the stars, these <unk> can bring that <unk> that <unk>.
And in one of the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>, there was a <unk> <unk>.
So the <unk> <unk> <unk>, and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This was the result.
Now, this is still more <unk> if you think that these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and that's <unk> about 30 <unk>.
It's about 50 <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, what we did did.
We have <unk> and <unk>.
Now they're <unk> all at their <unk>.
<unk> the end of <unk> the <unk> is going to be new <unk>.
We <unk> it, and we <unk> to get <unk> to <unk> and <unk>, and keep our <unk>, and we'll continue to find what the universe are.
Now, of course, in a certain way, these <unk> <unk> the <unk> on the <unk> of science and <unk>. It's easy to <unk>. It's easy to <unk>.
I think the fact that's so hard, the fact that it's the value of things like <unk>.
I want to end with the words of a <unk> <unk>, which, <unk> <unk>, which, in <unk> <unk> <unk>, which <unk> <unk>, the <unk> was Michael <unk>, he said, "<unk> is <unk> <unk> to the human mind as the <unk> that the <unk> of the human mind as the <unk> that the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk>, which are <unk>," <unk>, "<unk>," <unk>, "<unk>," <unk>, "
Thank you.
I want to start to <unk> <unk> to <unk> to <unk> to <unk>.
As <unk> as <unk> and <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, in fact, we think and <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> to the way that we <unk> a lot of the world around us.
So, from <unk> <unk> from <unk> <unk> of our <unk> with <unk> objects, together to my <unk> <unk>, and my <unk> <unk> <unk>, I started to <unk>, "And if we use a computer, instead of having the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on a <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
and we <unk> to our <unk>?
The question was so interesting that we <unk> to explore the answer, building <unk>.
In a few words, a <unk> is a computer <unk> as a <unk>.
In a few words, a <unk> is a computer <unk> as a <unk>.
You can <unk> them with the hand, you can see them with them, and they feel their movement and have a <unk> <unk>.
But <unk>, they're <unk>, as <unk>, you can just <unk>.
<unk> are the <unk> of a new <unk> of tools to <unk> the digital information.
And as as much <unk>, <unk> of the <unk>, <unk> of the movement, and as they become more <unk>, <unk> of the <unk>, <unk> of the <unk> movement, we can explore new <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
It's going to start with a few simple example.
This <unk> is <unk> to show video: if you <unk> it in a direction, the video <unk> <unk> so if we <unk> from the other side.
These <unk> <unk> are <unk> of others.
If you <unk> them, you get them to what's going around.
If they're <unk>, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, if they're <unk> it.
If they're <unk>, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, if they're <unk> it.
They also <unk> their movement and <unk>.
We've got to realize that one of the interesting <unk> of <unk> was the <unk> that we could use <unk> <unk> on the data, to example, "<unk> a color of the <unk>.
In this case, we have three <unk> <unk> as <unk> of <unk> and I can <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk>, where you get <unk>.
and I can <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk>, where you <unk>.
If you <unk> too, we can <unk> a little bit of a place.
I'm also <unk> <unk> <unk>, as <unk>, as <unk>, <unk>, the <unk> and <unk> where people are going to try to do things, and <unk> the results.
Now I'm --
This is a <unk> sequence that I do with a <unk> <unk>.
And here we have a <unk> of words that's <unk> between <unk> and <unk>.
<unk>, every <unk> <unk> a letter to <unk> a letter on every <unk>, <unk>, every <unk> <unk> a letter to <unk> a letter to <unk>, and as <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on a <unk>.
And then, about 30 seconds, you have a new <unk> of <unk> and new possibilities of <unk> and new possibilities to try.
Thank you.
So here's the kids <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk>, I did in the way that I <unk> them and I <unk> a video.
They're <unk> very <unk>.
And one of the interesting things of <unk> is that you don't have to give people a lot of <unk>.
You just say, "<unk> of the words," and they know exactly what to do.
Here's other people who are <unk>.
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, there's right.
It's actually wanted to <unk>.
They were just <unk>, for him.
Now, this is a <unk> of a <unk> <unk>.
<unk> building a <unk> for the <unk> of the <unk>. He's <unk>.
It can <unk> new characters in the <unk>, <unk> their <unk>.
It can <unk> new characters in the <unk>, <unk> their <unk>.
So, it's doing the sun.
<unk>: The sun is <unk>.
David <unk>: Now he took a <unk> in the scene.
<unk>: <unk> <unk>.
<unk> work! <unk>!
So, <unk> the <unk> and <unk> can <unk> the characters --
<unk>: <unk>!
-- I <unk> your story.
<unk>: <unk>!
<unk>: It's a <unk> story with the final <unk>, and you can decide him as a <unk>.
<unk>: It's a <unk> story with the final <unk>, and you can decide him as a <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>, <unk>.
<unk>: The last example, I have the time to show you is a <unk>, I've been <unk>, for <unk> and <unk> music.
It's a tool, made of <unk>, and <unk> music.
<unk> here is <unk> by <unk> as the <unk>, <unk> and <unk>.
And you have these four different <unk>, and you can choose what to use.
You can also <unk> these <unk> in a <unk> sequence of your <unk>.
And I just <unk> a <unk>, you know, "and a sequence."
These are actually that you can control from the live, as the <unk> and <unk>.
You <unk> it to a particular sound and then <unk> to <unk>.
And then there are the effects of time and <unk>, which <unk> the entire sequence.
It's like it works.
<unk>: <unk> <unk> a <unk> in two <unk>, "<unk> in a <unk>, the <unk> in a series, the <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
Now, you're going to <unk> a <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>: And now I'm going to <unk> the <unk>, so I can control the effect from live.
<unk>: <unk>: I can <unk> the entire <unk> <unk> the <unk> on one side or another.
<unk>: <unk>: And now we <unk> the <unk> <unk> to <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>: I can <unk> the sequence of the <unk>.
So I don't have to <unk> before, but I can <unk>, I can <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
And now, finally, I can <unk> the entire <unk> <unk> on the left <unk> <unk>.
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is to build new <unk> <unk>, and more <unk> <unk> to work work like our brain and body.
And today, I had time to show you one of this <unk>, and some possibilities that we're trying to bring out of the lab.
And the concept I want to <unk> is that's going to <unk> this new generation of objects to <unk> with media <unk>, which we're going to do it in our world in the way we want.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the <unk> of you.
I'm a <unk>.
<unk> books is my <unk>, but it's more than this, of course.
It's also the love and <unk> of my life.
And I don't look like that.
But, said this, something particular happened happened in my life and my career, which has taken me to <unk> the whole whole <unk> with this work.
The particular thing is I <unk> wrote this book, this <unk> called "<unk>," <unk>, "which," which, "which," which, "<unk>," which, "<unk> <unk>."
And the result is that everywhere are now, people <unk> me as if I was <unk>.
<unk> -- <unk>, <unk>!
I'm going to be <unk> and say, "You don't fear of you don't have to do better?
You don't fear of <unk> to write for all life without more to be able to create a book? "
that can <unk> somebody? "
It's <unk>, you know.
But it might be worse, and I remember that more than 20 years ago, when I started to say to people -- I was a <unk> -- I wanted to be a <unk>.
I <unk> at the same <unk> <unk>.
And people said, "Don't <unk> to be going to be going to be successful?
You don't fear that the <unk> of the <unk> you?
You don't fear of doing this <unk> for all life without anything to get out and <unk> on a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>? "
So, you know.
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is, "Yes."
And I fear of all those things.
I've always <unk>.
And I also think of other things that people can't <unk>.
As the <unk> and other things <unk>.
But, as much about the <unk> I thought and I thought I was <unk> to me is why?
Is it <unk>?
It's <unk> who who <unk> <unk> <unk> to be <unk> from a job that you feel that you can do.
But what's so particular in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in a way that <unk> <unk> in a way that other <unk> don't do?
Like my father, for example, he was a <unk> <unk> and I didn't remember one time in his 40 years of activity in his 40 years of activity in which was asked to be <unk>?
It was never -- that <unk> of the <unk> John, how does it?
You don't know that, <unk>?
<unk>, the engineers as a group of <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We <unk>, we have enough this <unk>, and not only <unk>, but <unk> of all kinds of <unk>, we have this <unk> of being <unk>.
And they don't know, another that you look at the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, only in the <unk> century, <unk> young and <unk> for them.
And the ones that are not <unk> to be really <unk> from their <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, before he died, in the last <unk> said, "Every book my book <unk> me a little bit more <unk> about the work of their life.
But I didn't <unk> <unk> when I said, because we've heard these things so long in some way we have completely <unk> and <unk> the <unk> that creativity and <unk> are in some <unk>, and the <unk> are in some <unk> way and <unk>.
And the question I want to <unk> to all here today is, you're going to do this idea?
I'm going to tell you this thing -- because it also <unk> by a <unk> distance to me not go to me.
I think it's <unk>.
And I think it's also <unk> and I don't want to <unk> <unk> in the next century.
I think it's better <unk> our big <unk> to live.
And I know that, in my case -- it's going to be very <unk> to start to <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in which I'm in my career.
<unk> -- look at, I'm rather young, I have about 40 years.
I still have about four <unk> of work in me.
And it's very <unk> that anything <unk> in the world as the work that <unk> after <unk> <unk> in the world as the work that <unk> after the <unk> of my last book.
<unk> <unk>, because we're all more or less friends here -- is <unk> that my greatest success is to my <unk>.
Oh, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>!
You know, this is the kind of thinking that leads to start to <unk> <unk> at the nine <unk> in the morning and I don't want to do it.
I'm going to do this work that I love.
So, the question becomes, how?
And so I think, after many <unk>, that the way to work to write is to create a <unk> <unk> <unk>, right?
I have to have a few <unk> from <unk>, and my natural <unk> on what I'm <unk>, and my natural <unk> on what wrote to get, and I was going to get all the last year models on the time, looking at the time, trying to find other society to see if you're going to have more <unk> ideas and <unk>.
about how to help people <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity.
And that research <unk> me to <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
And it's because it <unk> in <unk> and then <unk> back.
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> -- people don't believe that <unk> creativity from men, OK?
It's <unk> that creativity was this <unk> <unk> and <unk> to men from a few <unk> <unk> and <unk>, for <unk> and <unk>, for <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity. "
<unk>, <unk>, <unk> to have a <unk> <unk> <unk> from <unk>.
<unk> were the same idea, but <unk> that species of spirit without a <unk>.
which is <unk>, because the <unk> didn't really know that a <unk> was somebody who was particularly <unk>.
And I thought that a <unk> was this kind of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> literally in the <unk> of a artist, a little bit like the <unk> <unk>, and <unk> out of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of the artist and <unk> the <unk> of that work.
<unk> <unk> <unk> here, that's the distance of what I talk -- that <unk> <unk> you from the results of your work.
And everyone <unk> that was so that you would be, right?
So the artists were <unk> to <unk> things, as for example, the too <unk>, no?
If your work was <unk>, you didn't <unk> all the <unk>, all of <unk> that <unk> had been <unk> from this <unk> <unk>.
If your work <unk>, it wasn't all <unk>, you know?
All of <unk> that was your <unk> to be a <unk>.
And so people <unk> the <unk> creativity in <unk> for a long time.
And then the <unk> <unk> and all <unk>, and we <unk> this big idea; we put the human being in the universe on all the universe on the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> this big
This was the <unk> <unk> and people to think about thinking about that <unk> creativity <unk> <unk>.
And for the first time in the history, it <unk> to <unk> to this or that artist as a <unk> <unk> to a person with the <unk>.
And I have to <unk>, I think it was a big <unk>.
I think you're going to be like a <unk> person to believe about being as a <unk> as a <unk> as a <unk> as a <unk> as a <unk> as a <unk> as a <unk> as a <unk> person to <unk> <unk>.
It's as to ask someone of <unk> the sun.
<unk> and <unk> completely <unk> and <unk> the <unk> and create all these <unk> <unk> on the <unk>.
And I think it was this pressure to have <unk> artists in <unk> 500 years.
And if this is true, and I think it's, the question is, the question, and now?
Can we do it?
It's going to go back to a more <unk> of the relationship between human <unk> and <unk>.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we can't <unk> 500 years of thinking in a <unk> of <unk>.
And there's probably people in the audience who <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of <unk>, you do <unk> people <unk> <unk> to <unk> on their projects.
You probably don't tell you all about this thing.
But the question I want to <unk> is -- why not?
Why don't you get it in this way?
Because it's more sense of all the other thing that has ever heard to explain the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> process.
A process that, as anyone who ever <unk> to do something -- so, so, all here -- so, you know, you don't have <unk>.
And in fact, it's a completely <unk>.
I did this <unk> with the amazing <unk> <unk>, which has now 90 years, but that was a <unk> for the whole life and said that during his <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk>, <unk> out in the <unk>, <unk> out in the <unk> <unk>, and he <unk> it, in the <unk> <unk>, and he <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk>, and he <unk> the <unk> <unk>, and he <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk>.
He said that it was like a <unk> <unk>.
And that <unk> <unk> to her from <unk>.
He <unk> it, because he <unk> the earth on his feet.
And I was to have one thing to do that, and it was of, words, "<unk> as a <unk>."
And so he was <unk> to home and he was <unk> from this <unk>, and he didn't have to take a piece of paper and a <unk> <unk> enough, and a <unk> <unk> <unk> on the page.
<unk> times, you don't get enough to be <unk>, so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> the <unk> <unk> through and she would <unk> to <unk> through the <unk> and she would <unk> to <unk> through the <unk>, and he would be <unk> through the <unk>, and he would be <unk> to <unk> through the <unk>, and he would be <unk> to <unk> through the <unk> and <unk> and
And then there were those times -- this is not <unk> the <unk> -- there were the moments of times, was <unk>, right?
So, he was <unk> home and he was trying to paper and the <unk> <unk> through, and he was a <unk> <unk> in the while he was <unk>, and he said, and he was how it was <unk> with the other hand and <unk>.
<unk> the <unk> from the tail and the <unk> in his body and the <unk> on the page.
And in these cases, the <unk> would be <unk> on the <unk> page and <unk>, but the last word to the first word to the first word to the first word to the first word to the first word.
So when I <unk> <unk> -- it's <unk>, it's exactly <unk> to my <unk> process.
Not all my <unk> process -- I'm not a <unk>.
I'm a <unk>, and my way of <unk> is; it <unk> at the same <unk> every day and work and work on the <unk>.
But even I was, in my <unk>, I got <unk> against that what, sometimes.
And I'm going to say that many of you <unk>.
You know, even though the work and the ideas to <unk> me from a certain source I couldn't have to <unk>.
And what is this thing?
And how can we <unk> it in it way to it not <unk> your head, but rather, what do you do?
For how much I have is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, which I have is the <unk> <unk> <unk>, which I've <unk> different years ago for a <unk>.
<unk> talking about this, and you know, <unk>, for the <unk> of life was the <unk> <unk>, trying to control, <unk>, <unk> these <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> these species of <unk> <unk> <unk>.
But then <unk>, he was <unk>, and a day as he was <unk> on a <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> all of him to him.
<unk> <unk> and all of a <unk> <unk>, and it's a <unk> of <unk>, which comes into his head as a <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, and it wants, you to <unk>, but not as <unk>.
It's not a piece of paper, he didn't have a <unk>.
So he starts to hear this kind of old <unk> to grow in him, "I'm going to <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk> from this song.
I'm not enough <unk> and I can't <unk>. "
And instead of going to go to <unk>, you know.
<unk> the entire process and made something completely new.
He said, "<unk>," <unk>, you know, you know, you can't see I'm <unk>? "
"You know," You know, "<unk>?
If you really want to <unk>, you're going to get a more <unk> when I can <unk> care of you.
<unk>, <unk> to <unk> <unk>.
<unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk>. "
And his process <unk> <unk> after this.
Not the work, the work was still <unk> as always.
But the process, and the <unk> <unk> that <unk> was <unk> when <unk> the <unk>, the <unk> that out of him <unk>, the <unk> that out of him, and <unk> <unk> it back from where it was, and it was <unk> that didn't be a <unk> thing and <unk>.
but <unk> this <unk>, wonderful <unk> <unk> <unk> a conversation and this <unk> <unk> and this <unk> and <unk> that's <unk> and <unk> that was not <unk>.
So how much <unk> that story to change a little bit about a little bit of a way that I've been <unk> me and I've been <unk> to me.
This idea, I was <unk>, "<unk>," <unk>, "and <unk>," and I <unk> in a <unk> of the <unk> that we're working on something and we're not working on something and we're going to think that's going to be a <unk>, which is going to be a <unk>, which is going to be a <unk>,
Not just <unk>, just the <unk> book.
And I started thinking about <unk> this project.
But then I <unk> <unk> that <unk> the air and <unk>.
So I <unk> my face on the <unk> and <unk> my <unk> to a <unk> <unk> in the room.
And I said to <unk>, "<unk>," <unk>, "<unk>," What, "is not going to be <unk>.
Because as you see I'm <unk> all that I have, I have no longer than this.
So if you want you to <unk> and do your part.
OK. But if you don't do it, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you don't do it, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you don't do it.
I started writing the same thing because it's my work.
And I want to do you that that was <unk> that I've been <unk> to do my part. "Because I -- at the end is so, OK -- <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> of the moon, <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and hours to <unk>.
And they were always <unk>, because the <unk> were <unk> and <unk>.
But every <unk>, something <unk>, something <unk>, and one of these <unk> artists actually <unk>.
And I know you know what I talk about, because I know you have seen all, at a certain point, a <unk>.
It was like if the time you <unk>, and the <unk> <unk> through a kind of <unk> and he was not doing anything about the <unk>, as the <unk> <unk> before, but all <unk>.
And a sudden, you don't just <unk> as a human.
But it <unk> from <unk> and <unk> in <unk> <unk> in the <unk>.
And when this <unk>, the people <unk> what was, he <unk> her name.
<unk> your hands and <unk> to <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, God," God, God. "
That's God, you know.
<unk> <unk> <unk> -- when the <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk>, <unk> this <unk> with them and <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk>, "<unk>," <unk>, "<unk>," <unk>, "<unk>," which you can still hear in the <unk> or <unk>.
In <unk>, when a artist has made something something impossible and <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> -- a <unk> of God.
And it's <unk> because we need.
But the problem comes the next day, for the <unk>, when you <unk> and <unk> <unk> that are the <unk> <unk> and <unk> that are the <unk> <unk> and <unk> of God is no longer.
It's just a <unk> with a <unk> <unk>, and maybe never <unk> to <unk> that <unk> to the <unk>.
And maybe nobody <unk> the name of God still as <unk>, and what did you have to do with the rest of his life?
It's hard.
This is one of the most <unk> <unk> to do in a <unk> life.
But maybe it doesn't have to be so <unk> if you can't believe, <unk>, <unk>, which the most <unk> of your being being <unk> from you.
But I just'm going to <unk> you from a <unk> source of this <unk> <unk> of your life that you have to <unk> to <unk> another when you're finished.
And, you know, if we think that's all of this way.
And so I started <unk>, and it's certainly as I have <unk> for different months in the <unk> of the book that <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> of my <unk> success.
And what I have to keep <unk> when I feel about this is, I'm not afraid.
You don't know. You're not just <unk>.
You can get to <unk> for your side, any of being.
If your work is <unk>, <unk>.
If the <unk>, you're going to <unk> <unk> to you <unk> <unk> <unk> some kind of <unk>, for a moment through your <unk>, then, "<unk>!"
You're going to do the same <unk>.
And "<unk>!" <unk>! "<unk>.
I think, and I think it's <unk>.
"<unk>!" <unk>! "<unk>!" <unk>, "<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk>: <unk>!
You know, I've already talked about some of these projects on the human genome, about what human genome can <unk> and <unk> of new <unk>.
Now we're <unk> a new way, we started <unk> to <unk> biology and now from that digital code in a new <unk> of biology, <unk> and <unk> life.
We've always tried to <unk> <unk>.
"<unk> is something that many <unk> I think have <unk> to understand <unk> to understand <unk>.
We tried to <unk> <unk> to <unk> terms.
We're <unk> by almost 20 years.
When we have <unk> the human genome <unk> to <unk> from <unk> the world of the digital world.
Now, we can <unk> life, or create new life from this digital universe?
This is the map of a little <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, which is the most small <unk> of those who can <unk> in the lab.
And we tried to <unk> the genome to <unk> a little <unk>.
We're able to <unk> a <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk>.
But when we give a look at his map, it's <unk> simple than our.
<unk>, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can <unk>, one at one time, it's very <unk> that this can bring to a <unk> cell.
So, I thought that the only <unk> <unk> was <unk> this <unk> in a way of <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> some of these questions.
And so we started the <unk> of the "We can <unk> a <unk>?"
Can the chemistry of produce these big molecules that we never have to create these <unk> before?
And in the case, we can make a <unk>?
A <unk> is just a piece of <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The speed with which we're able to <unk> life is <unk> to <unk> <unk>.
Our ability to write the code, instead of <unk>, rather slowly, but it's <unk>.
And our most <unk> results on a <unk> <unk>.
We have <unk> more than 15 years ago.
The process has <unk> a lot of <unk>, <unk> with a <unk> <unk> before we <unk> the first experiments.
But we found that we found that DNA is very hard.
There are <unk> of thousands of machines in the world that <unk> little <unk> of DNA, <unk> <unk> <unk>, and it's a <unk> process: the most <unk> <unk> is <unk>, the most <unk> <unk> is <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, there are.
So we had to develop a new <unk> to <unk> these <unk> and <unk> the <unk>.
And this was our first <unk>, from the digital <unk> of the <unk> genome <unk> <unk>.
It's a little <unk> <unk>.
We designed the <unk>, <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> a DNA <unk> of DNA <unk> <unk>.
The interesting part is when we took this piece of <unk> <unk> <unk> and we have <unk> in bacteria, the bacteria have <unk> to read this code and <unk> the <unk> particles.
<unk> particles are <unk> by cells, they're <unk> by cells, they're <unk> <unk>.
I've been talking about <unk> <unk> <unk> that they have certainly <unk> this model.
They have more than you.
And I think this is a situation where the software can actually build his same <unk> in a <unk> system.
But I <unk> to do things in big.
<unk> to build the entire <unk>.
They're more than <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
So we thought about <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk>, so we can change the <unk> to understand what are the <unk> of a <unk> cell.
<unk> is <unk>, and if we <unk> with information in a computer, these must be very <unk>.
When I <unk> this genome for the first time in <unk> the <unk> <unk> was a <unk> for every 10 <unk> <unk>.
We've found, 30 <unk>. If we were <unk> that original sequence, you can never be able to do this work.
A part of the process is to design <unk> <unk> that <unk> with all the other <unk> of 50 to build <unk> <unk> to build more small <unk> that <unk> together.
<unk> elements here.
You probably know that you're <unk>.
<unk> <unk>: So we have a <unk> <unk> <unk> on four <unk>: <unk>, <unk>, <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> of those <unk> <unk> together <unk> <unk> about 20 <unk>, and there's a <unk> order to <unk> every <unk>.
So we can use the <unk> code to write words, <unk>.
What we did was in the beginning was <unk>.
Some of them have been <unk> by the fact that it wasn't <unk>.
We designed these <unk> to <unk> <unk>.
There are <unk> that <unk> them and <unk> them.
And we started <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> in a way of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to them to them <unk> <unk>.
So, every step, we have produced these <unk> in <unk> so that we're <unk> to create a <unk> <unk> as you see in a minute.
We're trying to <unk> the process.
So, this looks like a <unk> of a <unk> <unk>.
When I started these <unk> <unk>, much more than 100 <unk>, <unk>, you're not <unk> to <unk> <unk>.
It's <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
So we have <unk> other <unk>.
And we <unk> of another <unk> called <unk> <unk>, which in biology <unk> to <unk> the DNA in <unk>, the <unk>.
So here's an example.
This <unk>, called <unk> <unk>, it can <unk> three million <unk> <unk>.
You can see in the <unk> <unk> as the <unk> <unk>.
And 12 -- 24 hours is <unk> exactly as it was before.
<unk> thousands of organisms that are able to do that.
These organisms can <unk> completely.
It's going to live under <unk>.
They're absolutely sure that life <unk> in space, and you get <unk> to find new <unk> of water.
In fact, NASA showed that this is.
This is an image of the <unk> that we have built using these <unk>, just using the <unk> with the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> them.
This image was not <unk> with a <unk> <unk>, but with a <unk> <unk>.
It's a big <unk> that we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk>.
These are pictures that <unk> a period of about six seconds.
This is the <unk> that we did a little time ago.
They're more than <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's the largest <unk> of a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from man.
It's got a <unk> <unk>.
If you <unk> it with a <unk> <unk>, we <unk> pages to <unk> this code.
Now, how do we do it work? How do we do we do it?
Of course, by a <unk> <unk> is a <unk>.
It's a little more <unk> when you use of bacteria.
It's more simple when it's about <unk> cells as our: you can just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> another, which is <unk> the process.
In <unk>, <unk> <unk> is instead of <unk> in the cell, but we have <unk> <unk> <unk> that we are able to do a <unk> <unk> of a <unk> cell to another cell cell cell.
We have <unk> a <unk> <unk> from a <unk>.
<unk> are the two different as the <unk>.
We have <unk> some <unk> in a more way that we could decide what to have this <unk>.
It's got it to <unk> with <unk> all the <unk>.
And when we <unk> in the cell was <unk> and <unk> our <unk> the new <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> went into the cell.
And <unk> <unk> that we didn't go beyond, but we tried to <unk> more in there.
This is one of the <unk> of evolution.
We've found that <unk> species have <unk> a second or a third <unk> from some part, <unk> in a second thousands of new <unk> to that species.
So who think about evolution as a <unk> <unk> at the evolution of the biology.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And the <unk> that was in the cell didn't <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> that we have <unk>.
It's <unk>, and it <unk> the other <unk> as <unk> material, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, and we're <unk> with only the cell cell and the new <unk>.
It's become blue because of the genes we have <unk>.
And in a short <unk> of time, all the <unk> of a <unk>, and it's <unk> of all in a new species, <unk> on the new software that we have <unk> in the cell cell.
All the <unk> are <unk>, the <unk> are <unk>, and when we <unk> the <unk> code that we have <unk>.
Now, this might look like <unk>, but we can <unk> the software, we can change things in a very <unk>.
Now, I've already <unk> that here is not about <unk> -- but of progress that we're going to start three million years and a half of evolution, and a <unk> version of evolution, and I've already said that maybe we're going to create new species on this process.
Why do that?
I think it's enough to <unk> when we think about our <unk>.
We're going to <unk> from six billion people to <unk> billion people in the next 40 years.
Right to give a example: I was born in <unk>.
Now, there are three people on the planet to <unk> in <unk>; in 40 years, there's four.
We're <unk> problems now to find food, water and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> for six billion people.
It's still more <unk> to do it for nine billion.
<unk> more than five billion <unk>, more than 30 billion <unk> <unk>.
That means a hundred million <unk> a day.
When we try to find <unk> <unk>, or any kind of process to <unk>, it's going to be a huge challenge.
And we have to realize that all of the <unk> of CO2 from these materials that <unk> in the atmosphere.
And so on today, by the <unk> <unk> in the world, we have a <unk> with about 20 million genes, and I think that are the <unk> <unk> for the future.
<unk> <unk> <unk> only a <unk> of <unk>, and think about how many different things are <unk> out.
Our <unk> here are <unk> data from reality and our imagination.
Now we have <unk>, thank you to these <unk> <unk> <unk>, to create what we call <unk> <unk>.
We can build a big robot that can produce a big robot that can produce a million <unk> a day.
Think about <unk> these 20 million genes or try to try to <unk> the <unk> <unk> to produce <unk> or <unk>, new <unk>, we can change, with a little team, and create more <unk> biology in the last 20 years of science.
And it's just a <unk> <unk>.
We can choose to choose <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This is a <unk> of some software <unk> that we're working on to be able to <unk> and design species to the computer.
Well, we don't know how they'll be.
We know exactly exactly how their <unk>.
Now we're <unk> on the <unk> of <unk> generation.
You've seen you who <unk> from <unk> <unk> was a <unk> experiment.
We have <unk> of second and third generation that we <unk> enough from <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk>, or different kinds of <unk>.
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without <unk> <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the cost of food and <unk> would be <unk> the CO2 in matter, which we're working for <unk>, and we think that we can have the first <unk> of <unk> in about <unk> in about <unk> generation, in about 18 months.
<unk> <unk> <unk> with CO2 is a <unk>, but in our <unk> in our <unk> in the world, we found different <unk>.
This is a <unk> that we have <unk> in <unk>.
<unk> in the ocean, at about <unk> feet of <unk> <unk> to the water.
<unk> <unk> <unk> of hydrogen <unk> as a source of energy.
We're trying to understand if we can <unk> CO2, which can easily be <unk> by <unk>, <unk> that CO2 in <unk>, to drive this process.
So, we think that short we can think that we could be able to <unk> what the <unk> is life, "We have, we have the <unk> <unk> <unk> the whole <unk> of <unk> <unk> the whole <unk> industry.
<unk>. If you can't do it from TED, where you can't do it from TED, where you can't do it from TED, where you can't do it from TED, you can't do it from TED.
It's a <unk> source of energy.
<unk>, we're working working for using the same <unk> to create <unk> <unk>.
You've seen this year with flu, we're always back to a year and a dollar in less when it's about it, it's going to find the right right.
I think what you can change building <unk> <unk> in <unk>.
So, here's how the future it might be <unk>, now, the tree of evolution, <unk> the evolution with bacteria <unk>, <unk>, and finally <unk> cells.
We're so <unk> people.
Our goal is to do in a way of living enough to try to try to try to try to try to <unk> <unk>. Thank you very much.
So, I'll just do you, the <unk> <unk>, some fundamental work, some <unk>, the new technology that we have taken to a <unk> <unk> almost a year ago. This is <unk>.
It's a <unk> environment that you can <unk> is <unk> in the local level that you can <unk> it with a huge <unk> of data.
And here we're seeing <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with a <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> the images of the images as we want.
And it's not matter how big much information that we see, how big are these <unk> of data, or images.
Most of the most <unk> pictures, but this is a <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> <unk>, and <unk> in the <unk> of <unk>, and <unk> in the <unk> of 300 <unk>.
It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that <unk> the <unk> of a system like this is the number of <unk> on your screen in any time. It's also a very <unk> architecture. It's also a very <unk> architecture.
This is a whole book, example of data, no <unk>.
This is <unk> <unk> <unk>. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. <unk> <unk> a <unk>.
And so I'm going to <unk> that's not about images, we can do a kind of <unk>, to see that it's about a real <unk> of the <unk>, not a picture.
It could be a little <unk> to read a book.
I don't <unk> it.
This is a more <unk> example. It's a <unk> number of the <unk>.
Every image is the beginning of a <unk>.
And it's really a lot of <unk> and the <unk> experience of read the real <unk> <unk>, or a <unk>, which is for nature <unk> a <unk>, which is for nature.
We also did something with the corner of this particular number of the <unk>.
We've created a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and we have <unk> in the normal <unk> and we have <unk> <unk> in the <unk> and we <unk> of the content.
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk>, you can see here.
Or another <unk> models, or even <unk> <unk>.
And this really <unk> some of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of space on the screen.
And I thought this <unk> to <unk> and other <unk>, and other <unk>, not <unk> to be <unk>.
Of course, the <unk> is one of the most <unk> <unk> to this kind of technology.
And on this is not want to lose time, if you don't say we have <unk> to <unk> that in this field.
These are all the <unk> in the United States <unk> on a NASA picture of NASA.
So now I started something else.
This is actually in the web; you can <unk> to see it.
It's a project called <unk>, which <unk> two different technologies.
One is <unk> and the other is a very interesting research computer computer computer <unk> <unk>, a <unk> <unk> <unk>, a <unk> <unk> of Washington, with the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. <unk> <unk>.
And it's from <unk>, <unk> from <unk>.
You can see when we do this kind of <unk>, where we can go from an image to another and have this kind of experience to <unk>.
But the <unk> <unk> of the images here has actually actually a meaning.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and these <unk> <unk>, in the way that <unk> the <unk> <unk> in which the <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> are <unk>. And you see the <unk> of the <unk> of a <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk>, and these things are all <unk> <unk>.
I don't know if I have a few other environment.
There are a lot more <unk>.
I want to go to one of the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> and this <unk> from a <unk> <unk> of <unk> that we have done for the first time, I'm going to show you what we're really going to be the key to show you what we have in the website. And it's not <unk> <unk> that we have in the website.
We had to <unk> <unk> and on the <unk>.
This is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> of <unk> and <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> of these <unk> <unk> a picture that's <unk> <unk>.
So, I'm all <unk> <unk> <unk> and they're all <unk> at the <unk> level in this way.
And it's possible to <unk> in this way.
You know, I never thought of end to work to <unk>.
It's very <unk> <unk> this kind of <unk> here.
I think you can see that it's about a lot of different kinds of <unk>: those <unk> <unk> <unk>, a number of <unk>, <unk> <unk> together in this environment.
And if I can, I can try to find those <unk>.
A lot of them are <unk> by <unk>, etc..
And a few here is a series of pictures -- <unk>.
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We can go from <unk> to physics of this environment.
The <unk> point is that we can do things with social environment. This is now <unk> data from the entire <unk> <unk> from the entire <unk> of how we <unk> the earth, from the <unk> point of view and <unk> all that data together.
All those pictures are <unk> together, the <unk> of the <unk>.
You have a <unk> model of the entire <unk>.
Think about this as the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> on Earth <unk>.
It's something that <unk> in complexity, <unk>, and the people who <unk> the <unk> with the use.
Their <unk> are <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> by other people.
If somebody's <unk> <unk> <unk> all these <unk> <unk> the name, my <unk>, my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of all of those data, and I can use it as a point of <unk> to <unk> in the space, that <unk>, using the <unk> of the space, that <unk>, using the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk>, and having a social <unk> and <unk>.
Of course, a <unk> of all of this is <unk> <unk> of every part of the earth, <unk> not only from <unk> <unk> and from <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
Thank you.
CA: I realized? What do you have to do is that at some point, in the next years, all the <unk> <unk> in the next years, all the <unk> <unk> <unk> in the world.
<unk>: Yeah. What's doing is basically <unk>.
It's creating <unk>, if you want, between images.
And it's doing that in the <unk> of images.
And what it becomes very interesting if you think about <unk> information that many of these <unk> images.
As a research research <unk>, you get a <unk> and the <unk> on the web, you have a <unk> and the <unk> on the <unk> of the picture.
Now, what happens if that picture you <unk> to all your picture?
So the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and the <unk> of <unk> that's really huge. It's a <unk> effect of the network.
CA: <unk>, it's really amazing.
<unk>: I'm going to tell you very much.
One of the main <unk> when you <unk> and one of the <unk> <unk> is the able to live in who have no <unk> <unk> <unk>, between who didn't <unk> the <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> thinking that the <unk> <unk> still <unk> <unk> <unk>, or that the <unk> <unk> <unk> are still <unk> of <unk>, or <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, or <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and that the idea that the idea that the world we live in in <unk> sense, but it's just a <unk>,
the <unk> of a particular <unk> of <unk> choices that our <unk> has done, well, or bad, a lot of <unk>.
And of course, all of the <unk> <unk>.
All <unk>. All <unk>.
We're <unk> <unk>.
We have to <unk> the death <unk>, so we don't have to <unk> <unk> and <unk> --
We have a art.
What <unk> is the <unk> <unk> of the song, the <unk> of <unk> every culture.
It doesn't matter that are the <unk> of <unk>, or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk>, or <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk>, or a <unk> in the <unk> of <unk>.
He was my <unk> of a <unk> <unk> in <unk> a month ago, or a <unk> of <unk> in <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk>'s mother.
All of these <unk> <unk> that there are other ways of thinking about, other ways of thinking, other ways of <unk> in the world.
And if you <unk> a second, it's a concept that can give you hope.
<unk>, the <unk> of <unk> <unk> of the world create a <unk> <unk> and <unk> that planet, and it's important to the <unk> of the planet, and it's important to the planet as <unk> <unk>.
And you can think about this <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and you can <unk> the <unk> <unk> the <unk> of all the <unk>, <unk>, <unk> ideas, <unk>, <unk> <unk> in being from human imagination from the <unk> of the <unk>.
<unk> is the <unk> <unk> of humanity.
It's the <unk> of what we are and what we can be in how much <unk>.
And <unk> <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> was successful to <unk> and <unk> <unk> very <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, for example, <unk> that 50 percent of all the species has been or <unk>, or is about <unk>, or -- in the <unk> <unk>, or -- in the <unk> <unk>, and you don't even even even even <unk> to the <unk> <unk> -- that's not even <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- that <unk> the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> diversity.
<unk> of all that is, of course, the <unk> <unk>.
When you're <unk> <unk> <unk> on this planet.
A <unk> language is not only <unk> by a <unk> or a <unk> of rules.
A <unk> is the human language.
It's the middle of the culture that the <unk> of every culture comes in the world.
Every <unk> language is a <unk>, a <unk>, a <unk>, a <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
And of those <unk> <unk>, as we are here in <unk>, at least half the <unk> is not <unk> in the <unk> of children.
They don't get to <unk> to kids, which means, in less than <unk> something, which are already death.
What's more <unk> than the <unk> of being <unk> by <unk>, the last few people to talk about a language, the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> or <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk>, or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
This <unk> <unk> <unk> was the state of somebody in the world every two weeks, every two weeks, a <unk> <unk> and <unk> with it in the <unk> <unk> <unk> of a <unk> language.
And I know that somebody of you <unk> "is not better?
The world doesn't be a better place if we all <unk> the language? "<unk>, then we're talking about <unk>.
<unk> <unk>.
<unk> a <unk> thing means that you can't talk about their language.
And I'd like to give you a journey through the <unk> --
a little journey in the <unk> to give you a <unk> of what we're <unk>.
And a lot of us <unk> that when I say, "I mean," I mean, I mean, a lot of different ways of <unk>.
So, for example, this <unk> <unk>, in <unk> <unk>, the <unk> of <unk>, which <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's a <unk> that's not able to <unk> the blue color from green because the <unk> <unk> is <unk> in the forest, which <unk> is <unk> in the forest, which <unk> the <unk>.
They have a <unk> language and a <unk> <unk>, "<unk> <unk>": you have to <unk> a person who talks a different language.
All this has <unk> in the past <unk>, yet the <unk> is that in these families in which they talk about six or seven <unk>, because of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
You're going to listen and then he's talking to you.
And I <unk> one of the most interesting <unk> that I've lived, the <unk> of <unk> <unk>, an amazing <unk> that had the first <unk> in <unk>.
In <unk> five <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
They did <unk> from the top of the <unk> <unk>, <unk> that this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> that this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> had never seen anything about anything.
They <unk> the picture from the earth, they <unk> to <unk> a form or a <unk> and <unk>, nothing, they <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk>, and they <unk> the five <unk> with <unk>.
But the <unk> didn't just <unk>.
They <unk> between them.
<unk> percent of <unk> was <unk> by their own.
We're <unk> <unk> and we found two <unk> and we found two <unk> of the natural <unk> and when we <unk> to know, they <unk> that one of them was so <unk> that they <unk> the same. [<unk> <unk>]. And then they <unk> it's <unk>.
<unk> were able to recognize the animal <unk> from 40 <unk> and <unk> the <unk> species.
<unk> years early, I was <unk> a very interesting task when my <unk> <unk> <unk> me if I wanted to go to <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> in <unk> society to <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to make the <unk>.
To give a sense of <unk>, I should have understanding culture and <unk> and <unk> is not <unk>.
It's pretty much of a <unk> <unk> <unk> of the world.
Very interesting.
If you're going to <unk> the big <unk> of the world, what do you get?
<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, etc.
A continent comes to <unk> out, thinking about Africa has no <unk> <unk>. And instead and the <unk> is not that the <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk>.
What makes interesting is <unk> is the <unk> relationship between life and death.
So <unk> do <unk>.
<unk> can be <unk> by <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of the live in the way that for a short moment the <unk> becomes the <unk>.
So, for this <unk> <unk> to say, "<unk> <unk> you go to talk about God.
We <unk> in <unk> and <unk> God. "
And from the moment you're <unk>, is the spirit that you can get you <unk>?
So, it <unk> to these incredible events: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> all the <unk> with the most <unk> <unk> are the most <unk> <unk> are the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, in <unk> <unk>.
<unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
In a continent <unk> of blood, this <unk> never been <unk> by <unk>.
In <unk>, I'm <unk> by a <unk>, but their <unk> is <unk>.
<unk> <unk> are <unk> from families, and they live <unk> in a world, and live in a world fact, in a world, <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> for 18 years.
Two <unk> years of nine years, <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of the mother, now are <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>.
So, all of this time, they're <unk> to their values, and only their <unk> <unk> and only their <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or to say the <unk> <unk>.
And the <unk> of this incredible <unk>, they <unk> out and for the first time in their life, at the age of 18 years, see a <unk>. And in that moment of the first <unk>, when the sun <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, all of the <unk> <unk> <unk>, all of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, all of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and he says,
"<unk>? I said, I said.
It's <unk>. Now it's going to you <unk>. "
They call <unk> <unk> <unk> and say we, <unk> <unk>, we are the <unk> of the world.
This <unk> level is extremely important.
When we think about <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> and the old story of the <unk> <unk>, which is a <unk> concept in his <unk> or maybe <unk> <unk> <unk> and say that these are more <unk> to the Earth.
<unk> <unk> are not <unk> <unk> <unk> from <unk>.
There's no space for these things in the <unk> <unk> or in <unk> <unk> <unk>, but because of the time and <unk>, they made a <unk> <unk> of the Earth <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, which is not <unk> <unk> <unk>. It's <unk> <unk>. The <unk> that the Earth is not about the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of human <unk>.
What does that mean?
And it's a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> that the mountain is a <unk> <unk> <unk> his <unk> is a human being <unk>. It's going to be <unk> <unk> and it's going to be a different <unk> of <unk> that <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> that a mountain is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that a mountain is a <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
That's the <unk> of a spirit or a <unk> <unk> is <unk>.
What's interesting is the <unk> that <unk> the relationship between the <unk> and the world.
I grew up in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to be <unk>.
And that's a human being different from my friends who believe that <unk> are the <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> that live in the <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk>.
If you start <unk> that these <unk> can actually create <unk>, <unk> to understand some of them <unk> <unk>. <unk> this <unk>.
I <unk> this picture of <unk> in <unk> <unk>.
Maybe some of you have heard about the <unk>, the most powerful <unk> <unk> <unk>.
What makes the <unk> is not the potential <unk> of the <unk>, but his <unk>. It's <unk> from two elements.
On one side, this <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
<unk> the only <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a little <unk> that <unk> a little bit of the <unk>, but it's <unk> with the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, very similar to <unk>, <unk>.
If you're going to see the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> that make a different <unk> of species, <unk> it has <unk>.
<unk> that <unk> on the <unk> is a little bit like being <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a sea <unk> of electricity. <unk>'t create a <unk> of <unk>; it's not a <unk> of the reality.
<unk>, often with my <unk>, Richard <unk> <unk>, the man who <unk> the <unk> was <unk>, with his discovery of <unk> <unk> in the '<unk>.
My <unk> is not <unk> these <unk> as you can't tell these <unk> as you're <unk>, you can't tell anybody to be <unk>. <unk> <unk>, but they can't be <unk> because they're <unk> by a <unk> that's <unk> <unk>.
It's possible to <unk> <unk> only if we <unk> with other <unk> <unk> that <unk> the <unk>.
Now, the <unk> is the <unk> that are in this <unk> <unk> are <unk>, the same kind of <unk> for <unk>. <unk> question: in a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We use the big <unk> of <unk> and <unk>, which can <unk> <unk>.
But if we <unk> to <unk>, we <unk> "<unk>" <unk> "<unk>" <unk> "."
What does that mean?
This <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> in the forest, and that our <unk> in the forest, and our <unk> in our <unk> species.
If the <unk> as <unk> their <unk> <unk>, "<unk> <unk> <unk> of plants, the rest of the rest of the rest of the <unk>, you know," No.
The solution is: you take the <unk> <unk> in a night of the moon and <unk> with a different <unk>.
And so, you don't get to <unk>, but it's much more interesting than <unk>.
Now, [<unk>] the problem is that even those of us who have to heart <unk> <unk> them are <unk>, but in some way to <unk> the <unk> of history of history than our real world, and it's over.
In fact, the <unk> century, by 300 years, not <unk> for his <unk> or his <unk> <unk>, but rather as the was where we <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of the planet. Now the problem is not the change.
All the <unk> through <unk> have been <unk> in a new <unk> to a new <unk> of life.
And the problem is not technology.
<unk> <unk> <unk> have no <unk> to be <unk> when they put <unk> and <unk> and <unk> as <unk> have <unk> <unk>, as the <unk> <unk> have <unk> when they <unk> <unk> and <unk>.
It's not the change or technology that <unk> the <unk> of <unk>. It's the power.
<unk> <unk> <unk>.
And if you look at the world, you know that these are not <unk> <unk>.
They're <unk> and <unk> <unk> out of the <unk> forces that go beyond their <unk> <unk>.
<unk> that <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> --
a <unk> <unk> <unk>, in <unk> <unk>, a <unk> that has been <unk> in the forest to a generation ago, and now <unk> to the <unk> and <unk> on the <unk> <unk>, where it looks like <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, where it looks like <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>,
<unk> to <unk> the <unk> with the <unk> <unk> to the forest.
Or in the case of <unk>, are the <unk> that are <unk> with the <unk> discovery of <unk>.
If you <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk>, where I'm doing a lot of research, you'll see the <unk> <unk> of the political <unk>.
As <unk> the <unk>, the <unk> physics of a <unk>, is <unk> at the <unk>, but the <unk>, the <unk> of <unk> <unk>, not just <unk>, but <unk> in certain <unk>, not just <unk>, but <unk> <unk> in certain <unk>, because it's part of the <unk> of <unk>.
And you can't understand the <unk> of the <unk> until you can't see the beginning of the beginning.
I <unk> <unk> miles from <unk> in the <unk> China through the <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> with a young <unk>, but just <unk> to <unk> with a young <unk>, but just to <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> million people <unk> from <unk> in the <unk> <unk>.
And the father of this guy was <unk> to <unk> <unk>.
which means that it's been <unk> to the Chinese <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> that <unk> <unk> in <unk>.
My mother was <unk> and his <unk> was to be <unk>.
It was <unk> of <unk> in <unk> at <unk> at <unk> age of two years <unk> his <unk> because he didn't have to live without him.
<unk>, who did the same, was <unk> in the <unk> of <unk>.
A day <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>, for this <unk>, was <unk> to the work work for seven years.
<unk> <unk> can be <unk>, but the spirit of the <unk> is from <unk> <unk> <unk>.
So, it's all <unk> to a choice.
You have to live in the world of <unk> or we want to <unk> the world <unk>?
The big <unk> <unk> <unk>, before he said that his greatest <unk> was that, in our <unk>, in our <unk> <unk> <unk>, and not only <unk> the whole <unk> of human imagination <unk> to a <unk> <unk> of thinking, but a day, we <unk> us from a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that were other possibilities.
And it's <unk> that our species is <unk> for <unk> years.
<unk> <unk> <unk>, which has given us agriculture, which has been <unk> us to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with the <unk> of <unk>, creating the <unk> of <unk>, creating the <unk> of <unk>, and we talk about <unk> years ago.
The <unk> world has been <unk> 300 years.
And that <unk> story, I didn't know we have the answers to all the challenges that we could come.
When these <unk> of <unk> <unk> in the world's <unk>, what you want to be human, <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And it's in these answers that we all <unk> the possibility of being what we are: a <unk> species, that has to make all the <unk> and all the <unk> can <unk>. And there's great times.
I <unk> this picture on the north of <unk> <unk>, when I went to <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk>, and this man, <unk> me to <unk> the wonderful story of his <unk>.
The government <unk> was not always <unk> with <unk> <unk> and in the '<unk>, we <unk> them in <unk>.
The <unk> of this man <unk> <unk>.
The family, <unk> for his life, <unk> all the <unk>, and all his <unk>.
You know, you know, the <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> of this man didn't <unk> by night or <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's <unk>, you <unk> <unk> <unk> in the skin of <unk> and <unk> in your hand. When I did <unk>, they <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> by creating a <unk>.
He <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk> of <unk> and when <unk> <unk> <unk>, he <unk> a dog.
He <unk> the dog and created a <unk>, with <unk> <unk> <unk> has created a <unk>, <unk> another dog and it's <unk> on the <unk>, <unk> <unk> in <unk>.
<unk> to talk about <unk> with nothing? [<unk>] And this, in different ways, [<unk> is the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> and all the <unk> <unk> of the world.
<unk> <unk> <unk> government <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of a <unk> <unk> <unk> of a big <unk> of California and <unk>.
It's their new <unk>. It's called <unk>.
It's a <unk> <unk>. <unk> all the <unk>.
One example of how a <unk> can <unk> with his <unk>.
And, by end, I think it's rather <unk> at least at least at the planet, <unk> that they're not <unk> at all.
For someone is home.
<unk> <unk> <unk> of the human imagination that <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk>, dreams of these children, as the dreams of our children, become part of the <unk> <unk> of hope.
So, we <unk> <unk> <unk>, we're <unk> that the political never <unk>.
<unk> that <unk> --
[<unk>] are not <unk>, but we believe that stories can change the world, and maybe we are the best <unk> to tell the stories of the world. Every month our <unk> <unk> million <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> our <unk>.
Our <unk> are <unk> by millions of people.
Our work is <unk> in <unk> to bring our audience in places of <unk> <unk> <unk> from which <unk> <unk> from which <unk> <unk> from how they <unk> and <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, the world's <unk> in the <unk> of diversity, and we have to find a <unk> of life in a <unk> world.
where the <unk> of all <unk> can <unk> our <unk> to our <unk>.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book I hope you've heard and <unk> to <unk> some <unk>, in the case, I didn't <unk> them.
I want to start with what I call "the <unk> <unk>."
<unk> <unk> of what?
<unk> <unk> of all the society <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>: "If we we want to <unk> the <unk> of our citizens" <unk> "<unk> <unk> to do it is <unk> the <unk>."
The reason is, from one side, in fact that the freedom is in the same <unk>, it's <unk>, <unk> to human beings.
And it's in fact that if we are <unk>, each of us can act to just that we can do all that we <unk> our <unk> our <unk>, without no one that <unk> in our name.
The way to <unk> the freedom is <unk>.
<unk> choices, the most <unk>, and more <unk>, and it's their <unk>.
This, <unk>, it's so <unk> <unk> in society that nobody <unk> <unk> in <unk>.
And it's also <unk> <unk> in our lives.
I'm going to show you a few examples of what progress has made possible.
This is my <unk>. It's not particularly big.
I <unk> a simple <unk> on <unk> to <unk>.
In my <unk>, there's <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> that you can buy a huge number of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> that nobody of <unk> <unk>.
Here's what the <unk>.
And then you go to the <unk> <unk> to buy a <unk>: <unk>, <unk> <unk>, radio, <unk>.
And in this single <unk> <unk>, there's a big number of <unk> <unk>.
We can do six million and a half a <unk> of different <unk> using the <unk> that there are in a <unk>.
<unk> <unk> that there's <unk> choice.
<unk> <unk>: the world of <unk>.
Once, when I was a child, you could get all the <unk> <unk>, <unk> that were <unk> by <unk> <unk>.
You <unk> the phone, you don't get it.
A <unk> of that, between the other, was that the phone never <unk>.
These time, they went to.
Now we have a <unk> <unk> <unk>, especially between the phones.
So, here's the <unk>.
My <unk> is in the middle, <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk>.
If you don't have seen in the <unk> <unk>, you're very <unk>.
And what's the end is that people <unk> in <unk> and does this question. And it's the answer? The answer is "No."
It's not possible to buy a cell cell cell cell cell cell cell cell cell not <unk>.
So, in other things about life that are much more important than <unk>, <unk> the same <unk> of choices.
<unk> <unk>: <unk> <unk> you're not going to be in the United States you're <unk> from <unk> and the <unk> <unk> you to do.
Instead, <unk> from <unk>, and the <unk> says, "OK, we could do it, or <unk>," <unk> "<unk>," <unk>, "<unk>," <unk> <unk> these <unk> and these <unk>. What do you want to do? "
You know, you know, what do you do? "
And the <unk> says, "<unk> <unk>," <unk>, this <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> these <unk> and <unk>. "
"What do you want to do?"
And you said, "<unk> if you were she was, what would you know?"
And the <unk> said, "But I'm not her."
The result we call it "<unk> <unk>", "<unk>" <unk> "," <unk> that makes it a beautiful thing.
But actually, it's not that one <unk> the <unk> and responsibility to make decisions from somebody who knows something, <unk> the <unk>, to <unk>, <unk> that's not about -- and almost certainly it's <unk> -- and it's certainly <unk> -- and it's certainly <unk> to make decisions.
There's a huge <unk> of <unk> <unk>, <unk> to people like me and you, that if you think about it has no sense, because we can't <unk>.
But if we can't <unk>, why do we <unk> them?
The answer is that they want to <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And so fundamental as a <unk> is our <unk>. It's a question of choice, as you see in this <unk>, "We don't want to <unk> the kids. You're not going to get a <unk>. You have to <unk> it.
And we can <unk> how many times we <unk>.
which means that every <unk>, you have to decide that you have to decide that kind of person being.
<unk> to the family and <unk>, a time the common perspective, <unk> <unk>, almost anyone, was that you <unk> the <unk> as possible, and they <unk> to get <unk> to the <unk> as possible.
The only real choice was with who, not when, and even what do after.
<unk>, all of the very thing to play.
<unk> to students very smart, and they <unk> them to <unk>, <unk> to a time.
And not because they're not <unk>, because they're not <unk>.
but why they're <unk>, <unk> to <unk>, "<unk> <unk> or not? <unk>?"
"<unk> <unk> <unk>? I have to think before? I have to think about the children or to career?"
They're <unk>.
And they try to answer these questions, even though this <unk>, even though this <unk>, you don't get a <unk> <unk> to my <unk>.
And they have to do that. They're important.
Now, the work: we're <unk>, as <unk> <unk>, because the technology allows us to work every day, from every day, from every day, from every day of the planet, <unk> that from the <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, there's a <unk>, and I'm not going to tell you about what the <unk> works.
I don't tell you, because I want to use it.
What does, this incredible <unk> of choice that we have about the work? Is we we have to decide, <unk> in every moment, if we have to work or not.
We can go to see our son to <unk>, with the cell phone in a <unk>, the <unk> in the other, and the <unk>, <unk>, on the <unk>.
And if they're all <unk>, every minute that we see our son, we're also <unk>, "I have to answer this called"? "
"I have to answer this <unk>? I have to <unk> this letter?"
And when the answer is, "no, this makes the experience of your <unk> <unk>'s <unk>'s <unk>.
So, from any part of all, we look, little and big things, life is a question of choices.
Once the world was this: <unk>, there were some possibilities, but it was a question of choice.
The world of today we're going to do this: "<unk> is a <unk> thing, or <unk>?"
The answer is <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> them all of the <unk>. So I'm going to talk about the <unk>.
So, this choice <unk> two actually <unk> on people.
The first, <unk>, is that it <unk> <unk>.
And so many <unk> between which choose, it's very hard to do it.
I'll give you a <unk> example: a study of <unk> <unk>.
A <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, with <unk> <unk> <unk>, with about a million <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk>.
What she found is that for every 10 solutions that are <unk> in the most, the <unk> <unk> <unk> of two percent.
With 50 <unk> <unk>, there's 10 percent in less than <unk> than <unk> when they are available.
Because with 50 <unk> in the <unk> of which is <unk>, and the choice is <unk> to <unk>.
And in <unk>, and again, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and of course, <unk> <unk> never comes.
<unk> that's not just that these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> for <unk> because they don't have enough money, it's so <unk> that the decision is so <unk> that we're also <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of work.
You don't know, they're <unk> to five to <unk> <unk> for the year from <unk> of work, which would be <unk> to <unk>.
So the <unk> is a <unk> of having choices.
And I think you're going to be the world.
"And to end, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> or <unk>?"
You know, you take the right decision, if it's <unk>, you know?
You don't want to choose the wrong wrong, and <unk> the wrong <unk>.
So this is the first effect. The second is that even though we can <unk> the <unk> and make a choice, at the end, we're less <unk> from the result of how to <unk> <unk> <unk> in which <unk>.
And this for different reasons.
One of these is that with a lot of <unk> between which choose, if you <unk> one and it's not perfect, it's easy to imagine that <unk> <unk> to make a different choice that would be better. And what happens is that the <unk> <unk> <unk> us to <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from choice, and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, the decision,
And when it was a <unk> decision.
And the more choices, there are, more easy to <unk> of any <unk> choice.
<unk>, there's what the <unk> call.
Dan <unk> has <unk> very well as the value that we give things from what we're <unk>.
<unk>, all, when there are a lot of <unk>, it's easy to <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>.
So, here's an example. I <unk> with all of New York.
But it's probably what you're probably <unk>.
There's this <unk> to <unk>.
A place of <unk>.
<unk> <unk>. <unk> day. It's all about them.
You don't know anything. But what he thinks is, "Well, <unk>, it's <unk>."
"All my <unk> <unk> are <unk>."
"<unk> <unk> <unk> in front of the home."
And it's <unk> two weeks from the idea that's <unk> -- every day -- the <unk> <unk> where it wants.
The <unk> <unk> <unk> for what we have, even when the choice was <unk>.
And the most of the <unk> that we have from <unk>, the most <unk> <unk> us to <unk> them to <unk> as <unk>.
Here's another example.
This <unk> tells us a lot of things.
It's about the moment, and maybe the time, and maybe the <unk>.
But the most important point is that anything you're going to do, you're not going to do other.
The things that are not <unk> many <unk> that can make less <unk> what we do.
<unk> <unk> <unk>.
I tried to my skin <unk> a new <unk>.
<unk> almost always <unk>.
Once the <unk> were just a kind of <unk> them and <unk> <unk>, they were <unk>, only after <unk> <unk> a life and <unk> a lot of times, they were <unk> a lot of times, <unk> to go well.
So I started to <unk> a new <unk> when the <unk> were gone, and I said, "I need a couple of <unk>, this is my <unk>."
<unk> said, "<unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>?"
You want them to <unk> or <unk>? "
"Do them want to <unk>?"
"<unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>? <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> --" <unk> to <unk>.
I was <unk>, and after a little bit of a <unk>, I was the one guy -- which was the only kind of <unk>. "I didn't have to be <unk> <unk> <unk>, and then <unk> from the <unk>, and I had <unk> <unk> <unk>, and then <unk> from the <unk>, <unk>, and I had had ever had.
It was the <unk>. With all that choice I had to <unk> the best.
But it's worse.
Why? I wrote a whole book to <unk>.
And the reason I was worse to say, I was <unk> with all my <unk> were <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And I had <unk> <unk>. I didn't <unk> to <unk> me when I was just a kind of <unk>, but when I was a <unk>, at least one kind of had to be perfect.
What I had to <unk> was good, but not perfect.
After <unk>, I was <unk> to <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> in life, not <unk> that <unk> the <unk> that these <unk> <unk> that these <unk> <unk> that these <unk> <unk>.
And this <unk> less <unk>, even when the results are good.
<unk> in the world <unk> <unk>, it makes it.
Because if I <unk> it, I'm not talking about what I'm talking about.
<unk> <unk> to this.
"He was better when he was worse worse," The reason he was going to get worse when he was <unk> was <unk> that when he was still <unk> <unk>.
<unk>, in the world that we live -- <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> with the <unk> of <unk> -- the <unk> that we can <unk> is that things are the <unk> of the <unk>.
You've never <unk> <unk> because your <unk>, my <unk>, you're <unk>.
The <unk> of happiness -- what you're here -- is, "<unk> <unk>" Yes, "Yeah, you want to."
I mean -- little <unk> moment -- that's really <unk> and my wife is really <unk>.
I couldn't do better, I didn't have to be <unk>.
But <unk>, it's not a <unk> thing.
<unk>, a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> when there's just that kind of <unk> is that when you're not <unk>, and you're <unk>, and I'll tell you, "Why?"
"Who is <unk>?" "" "<unk> is <unk>.
The world is the <unk>. What I could do?
When there are hundreds of <unk>, and you <unk> a <unk>, and you <unk> a <unk>, and you'll <unk> who is the <unk>, it's <unk> that the <unk> you're.
And they could do better.
And by hundreds of <unk> available, there are no <unk> for the <unk>.
So when people are doing decisions, even though the result is <unk>, you get <unk> and <unk> <unk> to them them.
In the last years, the <unk> is <unk> in the <unk> world.
I think a <unk> <unk> -- not the only one, but important -- of this <unk> <unk> <unk> is just that people have experiences because the <unk> are too <unk>.
And when they have to <unk> this situation they think that <unk> is their.
So the final result is that we're better, <unk>, <unk>, but we <unk>.
Let me tell you.
This is the <unk> <unk>, what we're going to take it for good and it's completely <unk>.
There's no <unk> that a little bit of choice is better than <unk>, but by this is not <unk> that much choice is better than a little choice.
There's a <unk> value, <unk>. I don't know what it's.
But I'm sure we have <unk> from a piece of the level where the <unk> our life.
Now, from the <unk> <unk> -- I've almost been <unk> -- from the point of view, the <unk> is the <unk>.
What allows this choice in the <unk> society is the <unk> material.
There are many places in the world, and you have <unk> <unk>, where the problem is not that they have <unk> choice.
The problem is that they have too <unk>.
So the <unk> that I'm talking about is a <unk> <unk> of <unk>, <unk> society.
And what it's <unk> and <unk> is this: <unk> <unk> <unk> you talked about how much <unk> and <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> are <unk>. It's a <unk> of money.
I mean that these choices, <unk> and <unk>, it's not that they're just <unk>.
They're <unk>.
They do it worse.
If a little bit of what our society is <unk> <unk> choice was <unk> in the those where people have too few possibilities, it would not be their life to <unk>, but also our life also <unk>, it would be <unk> to <unk> our own.
This is what the <unk> call a <unk> <unk>.
A <unk> of <unk> income, well, not only to the poor people -- because of this choice in <unk> that we <unk>.
And so, I said, "You can become all you want to be --
<unk>, people, <unk>, <unk>, "But what <unk> that fish?"
"It's <unk> you can't make anything in a <unk> of glass."
"A <unk> <unk>, a <unk> <unk> <unk> of the world --"
and I <unk> it, I got it so, at the beginning.
But then, <unk>, I realized that that fish knows that that fish <unk> knows that fish knows.
Because the reality of the fact that if you <unk> <unk> the <unk>, in the way that you can't <unk> the freedom. You can't <unk> the freedom.
If you <unk> the <unk> in a way that everything you can <unk> the <unk>.
<unk> the <unk>, and <unk> <unk>.
Everybody needs a <unk>.
This is almost certainly too <unk>, maybe even for the fish, and certainly, for us.
But the <unk> of some <unk> <unk> is a <unk> for <unk> and, <unk>, for <unk>.
Thank you.
