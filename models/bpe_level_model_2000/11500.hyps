The year I showed these slide to show that the calots to show that the calots of the artical size, which is almost three million years had had the sizes of 40 percent of the 40 percent.
All this under of the gravity of the problem because it doesn't show it in the ice of the glacishing of the glacishing the glacishing the gravity of the issue.
The matter glacial calry, in a sense, the climbs of the climate system.
You know, the wind and wind and the western the west.
The next next device, the next degrees will be a rapid of the last 25 years.
The garms are signed in red red red red red it.
As you see it up to the blue well as the blue west.
That's the wind in the winver, which is the late in the west.
You can see that the cosid-called the English, five years of five years or more, is like the sanks, which is like the sket, which is like the sket.
In 25 years is spent from this, like this.
This is a problem because the interesting lacive in the ocean in the ocean to the ocean to the ocean where there are enormous amount of carbon -- they turn up to the microbs to the microbs of microbs to the microbe.
Rished to the totality of the atmospheric of global action to global global climate that we could ran this point of not ritor.
In some of the deep-deep-foundation in Alaska he's already rebooks from water.
The professor, Katey Walter the University of Alaska is recated team a team of the taking a team of the basic score.
Video: Wow! Al Gore: You're going to be us. The question.
A motivating motivating terms of the Eththmic, the Greenland from the north.
This is a glacial record.
The levels had never reached levels simild.
This is the Kangerlusual Rewest Greenlandscape of the Greenland of the Greenland of the Greenland in the Greenland.
If you want to know how the sky level of the mate of the level of the level of the level of the level of the mare.
These corrents are increasing rapidly folds.

This is a walking of the instainable.
If you look in the story if you can see the consequence.
In the last five years we add 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the ocean in the ocean in the oceans every day.
Look at the American area of oriental Pacific American extinct of American extinct of the subjects of the subjects of the continent, where there's a very poor in the ocean.
Most of global warming global deforest deformation, which is 20th 20, is the usual deformation of the deformation were the usual field.
Oil is a problem, and the carbon is perhaps the charbon is perhaps the basic problem,
The United States are one of the most emission, together with Cina.
And they proponed a lot of other centrate of the carbon the carbon the down.
But we're assisting to a change or direction.
These are the projects in the last years, and some of the proposes of the version of the version of the version of the version of the version of the version of the realternative years and some of the places of the realternative years and some of the places and some proposites.
Actually, there's a political loten political in our Paese.
The industries of the carbon and oil have 250 million dollars in the last year to promote the year to promote the charbon clean hossided.
This image me remind me --

In fact, the carbon is not spore.
We think it's a good -- it has a good progress.
So not predictately, the climate change.
Let me do now.

If you want to go to the ways, you go together."
We have to go to the way.
Thank you very much.
The year TED phececks a introduction on the LHC.
And they promise to ritoral to get to the machine.
So I understand the other time we don't want to be the other time -- the LHC is the largest scientific experiment -- 27 miles of conference.
His recognize the conditions that were less than a billion second of a second billion in the beginning, 600 million times a second.
All is simply environment.
This is the Gineva.
We have these mini-Big Bang Bang Bang Big Bang Big Bang Big Bang Big Big Bang Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Bang Bang Bang Big Big Big Big Blevel.
This is what I work. She called ATLAS -- is a 44 meters and it has a diameter diameter and he's a 2-feet and he's a diamet.
This is a picture of ATLAS in ATLAS in building the proportion of the proportion of the proportion of it.
The 10 settember of the scores we have accesor the machine for the first time.
And this picture was taken by ATLAS.
It was because of the immenses in the heads in the health.
It's a picture of the first particles, which had made all of the game of the LHC, ring in collision, deliberately, with a part of the LHC, and hard particles.
In other words, when we see that the 10 settember 10 settember that machine works, we would see that the machine works, which is a great liftell.
I don't know if it was this to do us more opening to the Google and saw this on Google and vide that the beginning was this thing.
What means we had a cultural impact of the science of the scientific impact.
Or a week later, there was a problem with the machine, I had to have these films here -- these films.
These are 13,000 prints when the machine works in the machine works in the power.
Now, the technical technical and say, "It's not true. They're not true. They're the too much under ty."
And instead can do it because when they are a very freedom in the supercondition of the supercondition of the surfaces.
So, in the less 271 degrees to the inferior to that space between the stars, these files can bring that corner.
In one of the most of the most of the most of the magnets in the LHC, there was a fabrication of fabrication.
So the movie of the movies are going to read minds, and 13,000 prints of course they meet a resistance of electrical resistance of electric.
This was the result.
Now, this is still more impression, if you think that these magnets fishing the fishing of 20 tons and that are placed about 30 centimeters.
They're damage about 50 magnets.
We had to get to the them, what we did we down.
We have repristined and advances.
Now, they're going to be ritoral place to their place in the ter.
Entrum of the LHC will be a new integrate of new intetegry.
Let's accender, and we waiting to get the data of the game, and keep it so our wind to discover that are the matts that are the matts that they are the matters that they are the matters that they are the universe.
Now, of course, in a certain the way, these accidents are the dibates of the science and the science of science and the science and engineering.
I think that the fact that it's so hard to go beyond the limits, I think this is the values of things like LHC.
I want to conclude with the scientists of a scientist, Humph, Humphed Davy, which image, in the involved in the inuses of his inuses of his hopen was Michael Faray, said, "No of the human beingly as the human human beings of human beings of human beings in the science of the science of the science of the human human beings in in in the wave, and that are in the triggested of the square of the suntil of the squeeees of the squence,
Thank you.
I want to start to rethink about how to rethink about how to go to the kids, you know, you get the matter matter matter matter matter matter matter --
While you realize that as a reachers and to make them and move them and move them and move them to think and solve them to think and solve the relationships and to thinking and eat relationships
The reason is actually deeply connected to the way that we understand the part of the world around us.
So, by informispirated by the elelection of our physics, together and my consults, and my consult to my collaborator Jeevan Kalanith, I started to ask with a computers, I started asking to the care of the mouse as a computer's hunseass that you move a computering hands as a crowd of the sket, we can get a little bit of a broke in the midle of the broke up with a broke of the sands with the soul, with the sand.
and the system, we are the food?
The question was so interesting that we decided we decided to exploring the answer, building Siftable.
In fact, a Siftable computers is a big computers as a big computers.
In fact, a Siftable computers is a big computers as a big computers.
You can move with the hand, they can see the side of them, you feel the motion and they have a radio and they have a wireless.
But basically objects are physics, as the battons, you can move to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to degrees.
The Siftable example of a new ecosystem of a new ecosypolar system.
And as a more physics, consciouss, consciousness, and the other people who become more physics, and they become more physical motion of the motion, of the other people as we can exploring new and the movie, we can exploring new stily and the interaction of interaction.
I'm going to start with some example.
This Siftable to show the video to show the video -- if you include it in a direction, the video oter.
These ritical ritrates are consciouss.
If you do them in fact, you are interesting in the year.
If they come up to the circumps and can agitars a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bunding.
If they come up to the circumps and can agitars a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bunding.
They also also also their motion and including the motion and including the line.
And we realized that one of the interaction of the interaction was the power to use the data, to use the data, a color, "versation a color, as a liquirement.
In this case, we have three Siftable configurated as sects of trum and I can use them to the color, where you melse to the color, where they misse.
and I can use them to be the color, where you missing them in the centry, where they missing them to be a mix.
If we do too -- we can get a little place.
These are beautiful as a ling-ling-mathematics and the mathematics and gymes where people can try to try and see the results and see the results and see the results of the results of the immediately.
Now I'm --
This is a Fibonaction that I do with a program of equations.
And we have a play play in the Scarabeo and Boggle.
Prically, to every turn Some of the letter in every Siftable, Pratically, to every turn in the Siftable, Protable, and as you try to get a letter on a letter on a landscape on a depending on a degrees on a detect land.
Then, after about 30 seconds remissing and a new set of lects, and you can try to try to try to try to try to try to get to try to try to it.
Thank you.
And here's where the children came to Middle Lab, I did it and I did it and I got them a video.
They are a lot of the molecules.
And one of the interesting things of this kind of application is that you don't have to give people a lot of education.
You know, you know, "Well the words, and they will be exactly what to do.
Here's what other people who tries to be it.
This is our young header head, there is a destream.
It actually wanted to be the implant.
They just were further, for him.
Now, this is a very very interactive application of a interactive application of a cards.
We wanted to build a tool, the Luke English of the Lui is Felix.
It can inserve new person, the scene, you know, you have a slilling Siftable to their associates.
It can inserve new person, the scene, you know, you have a slilling Siftable to their associates.
And that's doing the solid of the sole.
Video: The sole is surprising.
David Merrill: On a treat the scen.
Video: The treatment -- it's a couple of it.
Bel work! Sa!
So school Siftable and put the neighbors can interact the people --
Video: Bau!
-- -- in the invention of the story.
Video: Cia!
DM: It's a story with the environment, and you can decide as you feel like you feel.
DM: It's a story with the environment, and you can decide as you feel like you feel.
Video: Vole, you know, you know.
DM: The last example I have the time to show you is a tool, realized to be recently, to field and exeside and exeguess to be a music.
It's a tool, realized recently, to field and exeguess and exeside and exequal music.
Siftable here are based by the base, as based on the basic and the bacteria.
Every one of these has four different variations, and you can choose what you can choose to use that
You can get these sounds in a sequence of a sequence of compore to your food to your food to your food.
And the modifishing to touch a sound "sound of a "sequence."
These are effects that you can control the live and the tree and the film and the film.
And they attack up to a particular and then include to advertiss.
And then there are the general effects as a time and um, which is apply to intersequence.
Let's look like it.
Video: DM: We will start a base in two Sift" in two Sift" we can put the system, we get in a serious side of the extreme of the extince.
Now on the basic line of bax.
Video: Do you add the percent of the ussion.
Video: DM: And I'll put the movie the bacteria, so I can control the effect of the live from the live of the live to the live to the face.
Video: DM: I know to fast the intersequence the time to a time from a time to the side or from one or from one or the other.
Video: DM: And I'll add the movie to the bottom to be expression.
Video: DM: I can get the sequence the sequence of the flight to the flight to the flight to the flight to the sequence of the flight to the sequence the sequence of the time.
So I don't have to planning the first time, but I can provide to try to make a longer or more corts.
And finally, finally, I can get the interest sequence the whole sequence of the left Sift-well.
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is building new man-machine machine is a lot more like our brain works, how our brain and body.
And today, I had time to show you one of the results of this results of this person that we can bring out of the lab.
The concept that I want to transmity, that is that we have this new generation of designers to interact with the media to interact with the digital world.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the time to talk to all of you.
They're a write write.
Sorefs is my profession, but it's more of this -- of course, of this obviously.
It's also the friend and the fashhim.
And I don't expect that can change it.
But what I mean, something particular is going to be recently in my life and in my careera, which has taken me to realibring the whole whole of the work.
The particularly thing I recently written this book, this biography called Mangia, Prega, Prega, Ama," and Ama," for some reason in the world and I became a great sensational, for some reason in the world and became a big sensational.
And the result is that everybody else to me, people are like if they were condence.
Dave, the face -- condence.
They are now all worried and said, "You don't have to be able to do you can't do that?
You have to keep to keep writing to write the life without the most of life without the book that can make a book that can you have to make somebody to do you to get somebody to do you to get somebody to get to be able to do you to get to the write to keep in the write of the life without of the light to keep a book of the book that you can be able to do this?"
that you can important somebody to the one?"
It's rashes, you know.
But it could go to the worst of the most 20 years ago, when I started to say to say to say to the people -- I was a adolescent -- I wanted to be a writer.
I meet against the same based by the country.
And people said, "I don't want to get the time to have happened?
You have no purn billion of the refilled by killed kill?
You have to do this mestishing mestishing the life without that nothing you know, and I was never and history to be in a heart of the hop of the clean to lose energy fliors of the falliment?"
So, you know.
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is, "Se."
I have a little bit of all of the things.
I had a lot of the way.
And I also have a lot of other things that people would be to ine.
As the galain and other things of,
But what I was thinking about the write and I thought and I ask and ask me is why you do?
Is that you know?
It's logical that anybody debes to be often to be often by a work that you feel to do.
But what is so particular in the preseseses to make us to be a reality to the reality that other people in a way that other people in a way that other way that other other charright?
As my father, for example, and he was a engineer and I don't remember a months in the 40 years of the activity that was asked to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be able to be engineer and I don't get to be able to be able to be the engineer?
Do you have never -- that block of the engineer John, like you know?
It didn't work.
Onestly, the engineers as group as group as group as group of course, in the seem of being alcolized to be alcolized in the depressive.
We have the writers, we have this reputation, and not only writers but creative growriters but creative creative of all generes, we have this reputation of being instable.
And it's not rest that look at triste of the deaths of the magnific of the magnition of the windnine and often to the young and often to the hunt hundred of the death.
And the ones that you don't have to be actually seems to be actually made by by their women.
Norman Mailer, before the last view of the interviewish said, "Ogni has killed me a little more" -- "Ognet, a little more" --
But we don't know the way when we heard about why we have to be able to be able to be completely interiorized in a few way we have a kind of interiors and soffer and soffavor, and the soffood and the art, and the art-up and the art, and it will always be a scientist.
And the question I want to bring to all of the today is, you're going to be with this ideas?
It is well this -- because it also looks like a centimeter of a centimeter of myself to me nothing that is not about this supposion.
I think it's good.
And I think it's also dangerous and I don't want the perpetuated in the next century.
I think it's better to incorporate our great minds creative creative to the live.
And I mean, in my case -- in my home -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to the right right right to the circumstances in my careers, surround the circumstances in my careera.
Of course, it's a none; I have a young young young years.
I still have about four decade work in me.
And it's very likely to write that anything to write in the world as the work that was going to be used to be the world as the work that was happened by my book.
I'm going to be ask -- because we are more or friends here -- it's probable, which my greatest is to my big and the midddle is to my shares.
Oh, Gese, you know, you think.
You know this is the kind of thinking that you have a person who begin to begin to the nine and I don't want to do it.
I would keep to do this work that we do it.
So, the question become, you know?
And so that seeds, after a lot of reflections, which the way to keep is to keep a psychological costruction of protective psychological cool?
I had some way to find a distance of security between me, I think, and I write, and my natural natural reaction is on what I was going to get E, and I was trying to get the next year to look at the time, to look through the time, to look through the time, to look through the time, to look through the time, to see if they could have the more and the ideas they could have the more and more than the ideas to see if I was a better than the best ideas as that I was write to look at the the the the time to the other other year of the writers.
as a creative people who creative to the inherents of creative emotional creative creative of creative creative creative to creative inherent.
And that research me to the anthic and Roma.
Seguitems because it was in certain and then back.
In the ancient Grecia and anthic Roma -- people don't believe that the creativity came to the man, OK?
It was thinking that the creativity was the inspirit of the divine and that if the humans from a few people can distant and cute, to reach and clues and consciousness and consequence.
The gregreats called these dives of creativity of creativity of creativity to demonish."
Socrate, wonderful demon the else of the else that elarged by the long.
The Romans were the same idea, but they call that species a genie.
The what's great -- because the Romans they didn't think that a genius was somebody particularly intelligence of intelligenigenies.
They believe that a genius was this kind of devine that you believe in the walls of the study of a little bit like elpho Dobby, a little bit like elpho Dobby, and that came up to the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of work.
Exxitional -- except -- that the psychological costruction that the psychological that protects of the results of your work.
And everybody knew that was so that it working, right?
So the artists of antic anties were protects of things, like for example, like the too narcific --
If your work was exceptional work was not to take and all the market, all of the market, all of the people who helped by this genie.
If your work falong land was not all of your broke, right?
They knew that was the your genius to be a incapace.
And so the people han conceived creativity in Occident in Ockay.
Then the Rinasciment and all changed this big idea; we put this great idea; we put the human human beings and the human beings and myself and no longer and without left to creature to creature that they write to details from the divinity.
This was the main of the human eximution and people begin to think that creativity came to think that creativity from ishing iar.
And for the first time in the story, you know, you know, you know, this artist as a gene of the argument as a genius with genie.
And I have to tell you that was a big herror.
I think that allows somebody to believe a simple person to believe as a recipes as the bottom and the people of all my mysteries and the people of all my mysteries and and the eeterness and the eeterner and the ethese, and the human.
It's like to ask somebody of enginoid the sole.
Deform and distores and creates all these expectative and creates on the performance.
And I think it was this pression to the artists in the pasts in the past.
And, if this is true, and I think the question, and I think it becomes and or?
Can we do it different?
Magarrobing to a more antics of the human relationship between humans and creative creativity.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we can't cancelling 500 years of a rational thinking about 18 minutes.
And probably people in the public that soll, that would be legitymen of scientific non-insects of the notion that they follow the next projects.
It probably doesn't know that you can not convinced on this thing.
But the question I want to ask is -- why you know?
Why don't think it in this way?
Because it has more sense of every other thing that you have ever heard to explain the process.
A process that as anybody who ever have ever been telling something -- so fundamentally, all of here -- you know, you don't understand it -- you know, you don't understand.
And, in fact, you can seem completely paranormal look like a mal.
I did this meeting recently with the extraordinary of the same Ruth Ston that has 90 years, but that was a little bit of the life and said, "I was a little bit of the Mr. Virginia, and I was working out in the walke, and I was the walked up the walloce, and I was the walke, and I was the countruth.
I said that was like a phrageorom trenough trenough tren.
And that was rotoling to the landscape.
I feel to be the way to be the land and the land and the hunt of his pids.
It was going to have a sole thing to do to that point and it was to say, "corrupt like a matta."
And so it was going to be the case and it was followed by this poet, and it should be able to make a piece of paper, and a mathemates a mathemates and a mathemates and a translate on the page and the past.
One of three times would be fastonished and the recorree and corree and corres and corree the rotate room and the rotate rolled and it would continued to roten through the line and it would continued to roll the country, and he would go through the countravel, and he said, "another poet."
Then there were the times -- this piece of -- I will never mentioned -- there were a moments that was the moments that was almost perdent of the time --
So, he was cording to the house and he was trying to carry and the poet, and he was the walked through the way, and he was going to go and then said, and then he said, that was like a walgasses with the other hand the off.
She was the offered poethrowed in his body and he had to put it in his body and turned was the pay of the pay was the pain.
And in these things, the poetimes would be presented on the perfect and intact and intact of the last word to the earth.
So when you hear the thinkers -- it's exactly evidence my creative process.
I don't have the creative process -- I'm not a condent condence.
I'm a mule, and my way to work is, I can see it in the same orary every day, and he slide and to go to work and go to work and go to the off.
But I lost it -- in my head, I spent against that I met against that --
And I image many of you the han han face.
You know, if the work and ideas and ideas and ideas and ideas I could not extremely know.
And what is this thing?
And how we can get to be relate to the head, you know, you don't lost the head, which you do to remain them, which we do it?
And as I realized me to be the best example I have the musician that I have a Tom Waits, which I interviews for a day.
We were talking about this, and you know, Tom, and you know, Tom, and the major the major the artist of the artist of the arm, to try to control these species of the kind of creatives to the reality of creatives to the inorizates.
But then I said, "Sewish and a day, and a day, and a day, and he was driving on the under of Los Angeles, changed it to him.
He was going to go and fast, and a little basic tracks, which is that you go into his head, which is a hopirations, and it was a very wish and the wish and wish and the wish and wish wish and wish wish and wish and wish the wish of a bad of the half of the ske.
It doesn't have a basic piece of cards, it doesn't have a record.
So I started to feel this kind of old old old it is growing in the him, "I'm going to be a hundressessioned by this song.
I'm not enough and I can't do a little bit of it.
And instead of the basic stopping it down.
I'm going to go the whole new process and fold-new process.
And he just said, "Scus, and he said, "Scus, you don't see that I'm driving that I'm driving you to drop?
"You seems that you can write a song?
If you really want to exister, in a moment in a moment when I can take me care of a topports of you.
One of triment, you know, you have to get somebody else today.
You have to disturbing Leonard Cohen."
And his process working on this thing.
Not work, the work was still knowledge.
But the process, and the fishing of the ancient was released when the genie, the genie, the genie, the genius that was nothing else to the other thing that was a kind of a kind of the indiet, and they had to be a whole thing that was a interiority and they had to be a interished and back back to the mind.
but it well-cliar work, wonderful bizar, a conversation between Tom and this thing is that I'm not Tom. and that he was not Tom.
So how the story that was to change a little bit of the way I was working and already and I already a time.
This idea, I was writing when I was writing "Mangia, Prega, and and he said, "Ama, and he said, "Mangia, and we were all when we are working on something and we started to think that it will be a deal to think that it will be a book write, and I would be write.
Not only good write, the broke written written write.
And I started thinking about design.
But then I rereminds of Tom that working on the air, and tries to be tried.
So I was the face of my face and I would say, "I realized my begin to a room.
And he said, "Sent, I mean, what you know, you know, what this book you know that if this book doesn't be brilliant to be brilliant not be brilliant to myself --
Because as I see that I'm going to put all of the hod, I don't have the morning.
So if you want to think it's better and you get your parts.
Okay, you know, you don't know what I don't know about it.
I'm going to write the same because I will write the same because my job.
And I want to do that was recorded that I today I today I today, because I realized my theat" -- in the end of Africa in the deserts of Africa in the North of the people were rather to the wall, and they were going to go to the move and the musics and the musics and walked to the be.
And they were always magnific because the ballers, because the ballers, and they were fantastic.
But every tant, of course, and one of these artists became in fact, and one of these argument.
And I know what you know about what I know the view all of the time, a certain the point, a performance of it.
It was as the time you stopping and the walerin's walked through a kind of bring and walked through a kind of hundred from the solit, as the 1,000 night night -- but all of the primal -- but all of the primal and it was in the suneav.
And of suddenly as a human human huntil as a human human him.
But you get accepty and under the diving of the divinity of divinity.
And when this happen, I knew the people who knew what I knew what was called her name.
They said, "Aah, Do and they started cant, "Allah, Dod Dod Dod God, God, God, God."
That's God, you know.
She had a nice -- when the Mororor, the Morinvent the Spapay of Spapay to the Spay and prunds to the walked by "Okah, Allah, Allah, Allah, "Oh, you can see in the flock or in the floor in the floorder to the fle-up in the floor.
In Spapay has something impossible and magic -- "Ah, oh, oh, open -- oh, maign, bah, maific -- a score, and a score, a score.
And it's great because we have to have it.
But the problem is the day down, the ballery -- when you see when you see that the 11 of the mosquares that are the 11 of Marteds and the Dod is no longer --
It's just a mortal death, and maybe it will never be able to be able to ask that we never get to the treat that theat.
And maybe no one will be the Dod of Dod still as well, and what you need to do with the rest of his life?
It's hard to it.
This is one of the most dolors of a creatic life.
But maybe it doesn't have to be so angoes to be so scientist, that you can not believe that the most extraordinary to your being being from you to you,
But I just believe that you have to be data in prested by a imaginable imaginable to be a little bit of the squisite that you have to spend somebody else when you go back to somebody else when you get to be a huntil of the square going to be in the prester of the square that you going to be a little bit of the squist of the squisite of the s
And, you know, if we think we think about this way.
And so I started thinking about it, and it's sure as I thought about the different months in the walls of the book that public book that public book that the public of my great deal with my great degrees of my great degrees that I was followed to my great deal with my big deal with my great degree.
And that I have to keep on the electric I feel electric to be in the wall.
Don't be arms.
Continua presents to your parts, whatever you can be it.
If your work is ball, you know, ball.
If you dive, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you would be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a moment through your shapes, then "Ole!"
One of triments, you do the same your does.
And "Ole!"
I think and I think and I think it debbits to teach it.
"Ole!" to you, you know, you have to have a human human head, and head, and head, and text the talks to keep the way to keep keep to keep keep to keep keep to keep the way.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
As you know about some of these projects on human genome of human genome of human genes.
Now we're starting a new new enough to digitalizing biology and now to the biology and now to that code the degital of biology, we are going to be in a new fashion, and designing lives.
We always set of the big questions.
"What is the life, you know, a lot of biological biological biological well.
We tried to be different approaches, and the terms.
We're digitalizing almost 20 years ago.
When we sequenced the genome of the human biology of the world of biology of biology to the world digital world.
Now we ask us to regenerate the life, or create new life from this universe to digital?
This is the maps of a little organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, which is the kind of a little bit of the small between those who can autoreplicate in the lab.
And we tried to reduce the genome of the genome to create a little bit more smaller it.
We're able to eliminating a hundred genes of the about 500 that are there.
But when we look at a matter to his maps in methaboles, it's very simple respect to the now.
Credetemes, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can elimine, a lot of the time, it's very improbable, that this can bring to a vivent.
So we decided that the only views to progrese was sintetic to progress in a way to be able to deficate the components to some of these questions of these questions.
And so we started the wind of the "Post we can intetizing a romosoma?"
He can make the chemistry of producing these great molecules that we never can create before we have ever ever to create before we have never been able to create before we have never been able to make this before we have never been able to make this before we have to make this before we have never been able to make these big molecules that we never can make this before we have never been able to create before
And, in case of them, we can make a romosomain?
A cromosomes is simply a chemical piece of inherts.
The speed that we are able to degityalize the life is growing exponential exponential exponential exponential exponential speed to degityalize the life is growing of the life is growing to degityalize the life is growing of the life is growing to the exponential exponential exponenti
Our our ability to write the genetic, progress of the genet, but it's more exciting and more more mild.
And our most results of our more results of a curve.
We started 15 years ago.
The process has requires a lot of the beginning with a biothic reviewing the first of the first experiments.
But we found that sintetic to DNA is very difficult to the DNA is very difficult.
There are decade of the world that produce of the world that produce of DNA, of DNA, of the long eththrown and it's a degenerative process and it's a degenerative process is a degenerative process is a degenerative process.
So we had to develop a new metom to assembling these framments and corrects.
And this was our first tentative in the particularly information of the genome of the genome of Phi Mr.
It's a little virus that killed foods.
We designed the phramments, effects of the errors and keep a molecules and keep a molecule.
The interesting part is when we have this piece of chemical inergence, and we put it in the bacteria have begin the bacteria have begin to read this genetic particles.
The particles are going to release from cellule, they came back to the cellule, and they have distruck the Ecover.
I talked about recent recent the oil industry was saying that they are saying that they certainly comprecise this model.
They have more than you.
We think this is a situation that the software can actually building his hardware in a biological system.
But we wanted to do things more in big things.
We wanted to build the whole batteri.
They're more than 58miles of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genet.
So we thought of the class of the size of the viruses, so that we can change the cassets to understand what the class are components of a vivent.
The projecation is crucial information and if we begin a computer, these are demyself in a computer, these must be very accurated.
When we sequence, we know, this genome for the first time in 1995 accuratezed the standard of a herror, for every 10 mibasic miles.
We found out of course, 30 herror. If we were going to use that sequence of the original sequence of the original sequence of doing it.
One part of the process is to designing the long 50 lects of the 50 lects of the other side of the other sides of 50 lects to build to build under to build under to build together with all of the works.
We can be a lot of the only one of them.
You probably have a read that we read the physical filight of the great physical fill.
Think the thing: we have a genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic code and T.
Three of those lects together with about 20 minamminammine of 20 minammino-minamines of lects, and there's a specifical minamaminous amminates.
So we can use the genetic code to write part, you think, you know, you think.
What we did in the beginning was autograph.
Some are deluses from the fact that was not exished to it.
We designed these segments for a few simply unique with the very simply unique with the middle of the same things.
There are imes that reparts and put them them and put them them together and put them them together and put them them together and put them them together and put them them together and put them them together and put them them together and put them them them together and they are the consequence.
And we started to assembling the particularly beginning with five to five to seven the letter of 24 milddle of 24 milddle lects to the lect of 24 mildddle les.
At every pass we produced these segments in the enough to sequence, so that we are going to create a proception of creating a minute.
We're trying to automatizing the process.
So, this looks like the tabellon a basis of a basket.
When we go to these very long long long, more than 100 miles of 100 miles of the basic milar weren.
You get to the limbs of the tools of the biology of molecular biology to the basic biology.
So we considered other months.
We knew of another mechanism, we call recombination called recombination of biology, which in biology, which in the DNA degrees in the universe of the universe to the segments.
Here's a example.
This organism, called Deinococcus radioddrinotive three million radiation.
You can see in the requarter, as his cromosometimes as a destruct.
In 12 -- 24 hours is reassembled as was the primal was the prima.
They were thousands of organisms that I have a degrees that I have to do it.
These organisms you can set to completely completely completely them.
They can live to the beautiful thing.
They're absolutely summmer in space and you can find the environments to find the environments of water.
ASA has showed that this was showed that this aven.
This is a picture of the molecules that we built these process, just just by using the board design to the design appropriate with the design appropriate to segments from a serious imagine.
The evidence of the automatically.
This image was not been taken with a microscope electronic microscope of a microscope of a microscope.
It's a very big molecular molecules we can see the with a microscope with a microscope.
These are pictures that cover a period of about six seconds.
This is the published that we did a little time time.
They're more than 58,000 letting genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genet.
It's the largest molecules of a definited structure of a major of the man.
He's a fishsh, a lot of the 300 million billion hundred million ons.
If we were passide with a carear 10 without space, you want to get to transck this genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic genetic genetic genetic code of the genet.
Now, how do we work? How do we activate we activate it to the do?
Of course, we track a young girls.
It's a little bit more complicated when you get bacteria bacteria
It's just a simple cells as the cell phones as the nuclear as our re: you simply to extremely ext that is practical process of clon.
In the bacteria araaaa's narromosometimes in the cell, but we have recently demonstrated that we are able to do a traping cell of a cell phone and a cell phone and a cell phone and a cell phone and active it.
We can do a bromosometimes a kind of microbe.
The two are different as the men of the topis.
We add some genes in the more way to decide that you can decide that you can be able to chromoma.
And it turns out with the science of the indetection to kill all the protein.
And when we put in the cells was a stuff, and you have a dependent to our graphy -- the new cell -- the new romosometimes is went to the cell phone.
And we were thinking we well as we could go to the test in the waste in the waste of it.
This is one of the most extremendous mess,
We found that anti-to-species have added a second or a third of a third cromosomes in a second thousands of new tracks.
So who think about evolution as a gene gene of the gene that you have to understood part of the biology.
They were in the human beings called the restription of restription is that deritical DNA.
The cell that was in the cellum is not going to be a well.
The cell phon-the cell cell that we have inserito-ha.
It's expressed and he's recognized the other cromosomes like the extranke, and we are ritual cell as a mosoma.
it became blue of genes that we have to put it out.
And in a short of time, all the bacteristics of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a species, and it's transformed on the new species, which we have insert in the cell phone in the cell.
All the protein are changed, the membrans are changed, and when we go to the genetic code of the equivalent of the equipment.
Now, this could look at the genetic software alter, but altering the software we to change the things in the hand.
Now, I have exploital here is the geness, but of progress -- but I realized by three million years of evolution, and I said that maybe we are to create a new version of the Cambriversion of the Cambrian that they make new species of the Cambriban evolution.
Why do you do this?
I think it's enough obvious when we think about our needs.
We're going to spend six billion people to the next billion people in the next 40 years.
Geeeasy to give an example, I was born in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for the planet for the 1946, in 40 years, in 40 years, they will be four years, they will be four years,
We're going to find the food now, water and clean and clean and clean and basic clean and basix billion people.
It will be more hard to do it for us.
One of the old-billion carbon billion carbon billion barried board board board of bars.
What means a million barbels of a day.
When we try to find biological process, or whatever kind of process to remain a challenge, it will be a fix.
In the most of the CO2 of the CO2 from these materials that finishes in the atmosphere.
At day, thank today, thank you to the science of scientific discovered in the world, we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I like to think that are designed to design for the future.
The electronic industry is only a dozen dozen of components, and think about how many different are coming out.
Our limited here are the main biological reality and our imagination.
Now we have techniques, thanks in these half midddypetic of sexization in the genomics of genomics that we call genomics.
We're able to build a big robots that can produce a million robots that can produce a million cromosomes to the day.
Think of the next 20 million genes of genes or try to make a little bit of a lot of different processing to produce the processing to make a little team, and to make a little team, and create more of a little team, and create biology of the last 20 years of science.
And it's just a sleption of the standard.
We can be able to be able to survival of survival of survival of carbon or of carbon vaccines of vaccines of vaccines
This is a few software some of some software programmed on that we are working for a computer.
Well, we don't know that we need to be like year.
We know how they exactly the genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genet.
Now we're concentrate on the reality of how much around.
You also saw you that you can experiment from the grate was a finishment experiment in the window.
We have carburant reality and third generation that they are going to be pretty much more than the burons of the most of butanol.
But the only way that biology can have a great impact without a big impact of the food and the coast of the food and the climited to be transforming CO2 in the primal materials that we are working for the first time, and we think of the first of the first time, and we think about the first of the generation in a generation of the generation in about 18 months in about 18 months.
The solar light with CO2 is a metodom -- but in our discovered -- but in our world, we have fun in the world, we fun in the world, we fun in the world, we found out of the world, we found out of the world, we have fun to the world, we found out of the world, we fun in the world, we fun in all the world, we found that in the world, we have fun in the world, we fun in the world, we found in the world, we have fun in the world, we have to find that different different different hund in the world, we fun in the world, we have fun in the world
This is a organisms we have described in 1996.
See in the ocean of the deep, about 2500 feet of the ebolliance of ebolliance of water.
They recovered by CO2 using a molecular molecular as a foot of energy.
We're trying to figure out if we can insonate CO2, which can be transported to be transported to be transporting that CO2 in the carbon to drive this process.
So what the short we think we could be able to increase what the question of the basic questions is the Not, "Not Not -- we have the dest of the remodel, and we have the internal to remoon on oil.
Exactly if you don't do it from TED, where you can you do?
It would be a main the energy.
Is we are working for the same same methods to create vaccines of creating vaccines of the same myself of the same myself in the same way.
You saw this year with the influence, we are always behind a year and with a year and it in the right right right right now.
I think that you can change in the vaccinable to change in antic.
So here's how the future could begin to be changing, the tree of evolution, the evolution, and accelerating the evolution with the bacteria and infinally infinally infinally cell phoneucarian eucarian eucarian eucary to be beginning to be changing the evolution, and the evolution, and the evolution
We're so so much from the best people.
Our the body is to live to live to try to make a long way to try to make it. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
Prie of all you to see the most rapidly possible, some work work of the new technology that we have taken in the new technology that we have to have a year ago in a year ago in the follow. This is Seadragon.
It's a environment where you can interact is a local level that remote with a huge amount of data visual data in visual data of visual data in the visual local of a local that you can interact with a local enormous envisual enormous enormous enormous en
What we're seeing a lot of gabyte photographer of photographer and a kind of a kind of a kind of a quickly.
And it doesn't matter how big amount of information that we see how big we see the great of these data or the data or images.
Most are the photographers are the digital scane, but this is a provision of the Bibooech of the Congress and in the gam, and reent, and reached 300 migapixel.
It doesn't do any difference because the only thing that the prestations of a system as this is the number of a system of a system in any time.
This is a book inter, example, or example, or example of images.
This is the Dickens. Ognes Dickens. Ognes a hundred represents a capitol.
And to show you that is just about head, and you can do a thing of the general of the general representation of a representation of a representation of a representation of a photo.
It could be a little artical around, a little book to read electronic book for electronic book for a electronic book for a electronic.
You don't need it.
This is a more realistic. It's a number of the Guardian.
Every big image is the beginning of a section.
And it will be the beautiful and the beauty of the read version of a very read version of a view of a very quote or a lot of a very very quote a lot of midddle of meet.
We also did something with the angle of this number of this particular Guardian.
We created a public phasulla solution of that -- much more others -- much more than that you use in a normal public -- and we have insert in the normal of the content of the content of the content of the content of the content of the content of the content to the content of that that you use a publish.
If you want to see the careful of this authomobile, you can see here.
Or other models, or the specific specific models, or perhaps
And this really really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on the scream.
We hope that that means you can be able to the end and other porary cheries and other porary cheries are not going to be necessar.
Of course, the maps is one of the most obvious applications of the most obvious applications of technology.
And on this doesn't want to lose the time, if we don't want to say that we have contributed to be in this camp.
These are all the streets in the U.S. SSSunder to a image of the NASA.
So now we go to the other things?
This is effectively from the websk; you can go to the webse.
It's a project called Photosynth, which combine combine two different technologies.
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual visual computers in the University of the University of the Washington the University of Steve Steve Seve Steve Selish Microsoft Rick Szelish Microsoft Rick Szelish Microsoft Rick Selish Microsoft Rick SSead.
And it's from the web, gestished by Seadragon.
You can see it when we do this kind of screen of screen in the other image of the other image of the experience of the month.
But the collocaon the space of the images here has actually a meaning.
The goritms of visualization of the computers have recorresponds to the recorresponds, which corresponds to the reality that you have the reality to the reality of the Grashi Grashi Grashi Roccipes -- they were taken from the slide-showed stable. What you see the rest of a slide-showed space, and these things are all the spaces of the space of the space.
I don't know if I have a few other environment.
There's a lot more space of the larger space.
I want to spend the Norginal set of the name of Noah-- and this is a precedent prototype of Photynth that we did to work.
We had to worry about the legal and saying it.
This is a rebuilding in Nota rebuilding Dake Dame images Flickr. Basta Dame in Flickly. Basta and you can images in Flickl, and you get images of the types and says that you can see that it's just a picture of the represents that is discovered a picture that is discovered to this model.
So I'm all the images of Flickr and they were all colleagues in this way.
And it's possible to get in this simple way in this simple way.
You know, I would never think I had to end to work for Microsoft.
It's very gratifiction to recognize this kind of accool here.
I think you can see that you can see that it's a lot of different kinds of fun of fotos in the SLR, a number of the SLR, a number of SLR, a number of mean, in this environment.
And if you reex, I try to try to the strange.
Many are blocks, etc.
Some somewhere you find a series of photographers and -- execule.
This is a Notos Dr. Dr. Deep correctable.
We can spend from the places of this environment.
The essential point is that we can do the social environment, is now now now to all of the internal memories of how to appear the Earth, from the visual point -- and college all of those data together.
All of those pictures are colleagues of the particular of the particular of the particular of the particular picture.
You have a model of the land that emerge.
Think about this as the Stephen Lawler of Stephen Lawler on the Earth
It's something that grows in complexity in complexity and the people that are using to the people who use to use the hundred of the hand.
Their pictures are with other people.
If somebody is the idea of the idea of the skets of the name of the name of the name of Notage Dah Da's suddenly to all of all of those data, and I can use to the point of all of those data, and I can use the the picture, and I can use the picture, and I can get a crowd of the recross-up and a type of the type of the type and from the red of the type of the total kind of a little bit of the recross-totype and and and and and and and and the real-user.
In course, a consequence of all of the extremely elaborated virtual models of all of the earth, you don't just money to views and images and the images and a hot of the images and the memory of the memory of the extincluding memory of the extremely interesting of the extremely interesting of the extremely interesting of the earth, but the extremely interesting in the same same way of the tells and the plane and the plane of the the satellitaries and the plane of the satellitaries.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I understand well? What your software to be constantly to do is that a certain the next years, all the photographs that everybody in the world to the interinteral world.
BA: Yeah. What is doing in the practice.
Somefs up the hyperl, if you want to be in images.
And it's doing it in the base of the images.
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the recheesses that many of these images that many of these images that many of these images that many of these images that many of these images that many of these images that many of the images that a lot of these images that a lot of these images that a lot of these images that are seedones that are seedons.
As when you do a research of the web, and you know, you get a frashes on the web has a lot of information about the pictures of the photos of the photos.
Now, what if that is going to get the photos to all the yourself?
So the amount of interconnection of the experience and the amount of reckets that is really enormous amount of the retash of the retas.
CA: Blax, it's really amazing it.
BA: You want to thank you very much.
One of the principal patterns when you travels and one of the research is the power between who has no demented antic anti-traditions, who has the the past of the pasts of the wind, the touching of the floor of the floor and lost of the floors and lost the floor.

No biology, for example, it would be about 50-percent of all the species is about the extinction of the simply -- in the most of the hypoctor, in the most of the biological diversity -- and you have no neighborhood, and the most of the cultural hythmics -- the midddle of the cultural history.
The indication of all is, of course, the perfinger's language.

Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some things that I written in this book that I hope to be able and provide and proverse to the rest of the college, in the case of the non-nasic in the case of the non-non-house.
I want to start with what I call "the dog, the official."
The official official dog?
The dog, the official society is the Western the Western dog, "If we want to mate the well-well-well-well-well-well-well-well-well-well-to the freedoms to the freedog.
The reason the states, in fact, in fact, which the liberty is in the same a value, is precious value, is precious for humans.
On the other is that if we are free, each of us can agive to do all of us to do all that that massimizes our well-myself in our well.
The way to massimizing the freedom is massimizing the choice.
More choices people hane, more liberts, and most of the free, most of the freedom is their well.
These rit, it's so fundamentally radicated in society that nobody would be able to put it in the dubbbe.
And it's also deeply in our lives.
I'm going to show you some examples of what the progress.
This is my supermarket. It's not particularly big it.
I lost a simple nine of the inspiring of the inspir.
In my surmarket are 175 conditions, without contributed the 10 variety of the line of the balswimms that you can buy to do you a number of the enormous conditional number of the falls of the fold-to-indegree.

Other camp: the world of the communications.
One volved -- when I was a child, you could get all the phone of the phones that were services to the phone that were going to get the mam.
He wood was wood the phone -- you don't buy it up.
One of that, in the other one of the other one, that was that the telephone is that the phone is well.

"What do you want to do you do?"
And you can get to the wis: "Dr, whether she was to do?"
And the doctor: "But I am not lei."
The result we call it autonomy of malato," expression that it looks like a beautiful thing.
But in fact, it's not that one is that one to get the fishing and responsibility to take something, and it's the doctor, and somebody knows anybody -- and almost of anybody -- and almost certain is a conditional conditional conditional conditional decision, and so that we don't know the real decisions to take the real decision.
There's a enormous marketing products of products to do that that if you think about you, and you think you don't know, if you think it doesn't have no sense, that we can't buy to buy it.
But if we can't buy it to buy them, because you public them to the public them.
The answer is that they want to ask we call the doctors to ask the class of change.
What of so fundamental as we have a choice, is a choice, as you see in this view in this view in this views of the bundle of the right right right right nowing to the right right right right now, we have to invent.

The only only only one was choice was with the choice and we don't even know what down.
Ogame day, everything is really to play.
I mean, in a very intelligents, and I do the 20th less work in the work of a time.
And why they don't know the brilliant well.
but why I am impenity, I mean to ask her, I said, "I would say I do it it to me to do it it now?"

You don't need to use it to use it.
What means this incredible liberty liberty that we have to be a choice that we have to decide we have to work or not.
We can go to see our child to play cell with the cell phones in a task in a task in the other, and the nbook, and the nbook, and the nest of the eye and the eye of the eye and the nurch.

And as the answer is "nachieved the experience of the wester's wind of your child better than what it would be in other conditions.
So, from any part of the things we look at the big and large objects and stily materials and stily is a question, and life is a choice.
Once the world was this -- there were some possibly possibly possibly dealth, but it was a choice.
The world today, the world is a positive thing, "Ilemma is: "It's a positive thing.
The answer is Scient.
The slide of the negative slide of the negatic negatives
All this choice of the two effects of negatic effects on the gatic game.
The first -- the prim, paralyside, it's producing that liberation is that reliberation of liberation that liberation is that reliberation that is that reliberation.
With options the stands of the choice becomes very difficult to do it.
I want to offer a meant mean an to a study conducted plans of thinking.
A colleague had access to the Vanket, the gants of the Vanth, with about a million of thinking, with about a million clients in 2,000 different companies.
What she found was discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are going to come up up in the more, the percent.
With 50 founds, there's 10 percent in less of the desions of the respect of the respect of it. Why?
Because with 50 founds, the choice of the choice is diedetail, and the choice is remaking chine.
And in the question, and the questions, question, questions, and of course, and of course, the questions that we don't have the major question,
You know, that doesn't just mean that this is just that these workers will be food to cannot enough to dog because they don't have enough money, that the decision is so that the decision is so that the decision is so that the decision of the work.
Don't tecip, they're lost to 50,000 dollars a year from the dator to work, which would be well displayed to the way.
So the paralsuspens on the skin the too much.
And I think that makes the world like this.
"And for finally, for the eternity: "ketchooo-sumption and or maines?"
You know, you would take the right decision is the right right right now, if it's for the eternity, right?
You don't want to choose the wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong.
So this is the first effect. The second is that if we could evitate the paralske, and we do a choice, we are less to be in the end of how we were going to be with less of how we were going to be the options of the scares that well well to the wish the scares.
And this for different reasons.
One of those is that with a lot of the wind of the choice and you know, if you buy a and it's not perfect that you would have a choice that you would have a choice that would be better to do a different choice, and the what's happens that happens that the sky of the choice, and the climbs of the decision of the recent of the decision of the decision of the decision of the decision of the decision of the decision of the decision of the decision of the decision that that that that that you would have to be a very much more more more more and winduce of the swollen in the chollowner and www
even when it was a great decision.
More choice, more easy to be easy to know who's detail, which is insodd-well.
Inoless the economists called the cost opportunity.
Dan Gilbert has asked a very well stamine as the value that we think about things that we are to depend on what we are going to confrontive to the confronting.
In the case of the options of the options of the characteristics of the represents of the alternative and be less to be less to be spread.

And the two weeks achilled from the idea that is perdriving -- every day, the possibility -- the possibility of parking where you want.
The opportunity of diminum of the defation for that that we have now, when the choice was excell extremely ex.
And the most of the options we have to be the most careful to be able to get to be a coast, as a cost-opportunity.
Here's another example.
This view of things.
And the living of the time and maybe the live to live to live to live to live in the way.
But the most important point is that whatever you choice, you know, you choice.
The things that we don't have a lot of four that they can make less that we do it.
Terzo point: you growing the waits.

It was the mas. Con all that choice had a ballo.
But I heard I knew I knew it.
Why? I wrote a book to understand it.
The reason that I was worst worst is that with all of the choice is that the myself were altising, the jeans had to be perfect to be perfect to be perfect in the wind of the choice.
And I started expectative minimes. I didn't expect me exceptional exists when you go to be a type of a type of a guy had to be perfect.
What I had water was good -- but it doesn't perfect.
After I was walked to the choice with what I was trying to insodddone in confront of the waits.
The add of options in the life of the people who are not going to be the expect of the stands of the stands.
And this will produce less of the disfations, as the results are good ones.
No one in the world of the marketing of the marketing of the marketing of the marketing of the marketing world.
Because if you know the way you know, you don't know what I'm talking about it.
The truths more like this.
"You was better when you was worst the worst of the reason was worst better when you was worst better when you was that when you was that when he was that when he was still possible to meet the surprisevarious surprised.
Ogay, in the world we live -- the industrialized citizens with the citizens with the perfection -- the mmassive that we can hope is that things are in the waiting to the theizes of the waiting to the theath expected.
You don't have ever surprised to the involved to expectative, you know, the mistay and waiting --
The secret of happiness -- what you're here is -- "Bassect."
I mean, little bit of the authobiography -- that I was really wrong and my wife is really stuff.
I would not do a better, I didn't do mean I don't have to be a little bit of it.
But you don't always get a bad thing, it's a butty thing.
And finally, a couple of jeans of jeans is that kind of jeans is that when you don't know that when you don't know you sodddddrive, and you ask "Why you do you know, "Why you do you saw "What's the kind of jeans is that when you don't know how to do you know, "Why do you
"Cho's responsible responsible is cle?"
The world is the responsible responsible to do we do?
When there are hundreds of jeans, and you buy a windown, and you ask you to ask that you have a responsible to be a responsible of you, you know.
You would have a little bit of a better.
With hundreds of variety responsible to the successful in the success.
So when people are decisions, even if the result is valized, you know, they were insoddddrops and they make the colps and they go to their own own own hundred to their own own own hundred decisions.
In the last years the depression is explose in the industrialized the world industrialized in the industrialized.
I think a factory means -- not the unique, but the important, the important, but that people have depression is just that people have experiences because the standard are too alties.
And when they explain this situation thinking that the colps is there.
So the final result, that we are general in general general -- objective --
Let me tell you about it.
This is the dog, the official dog, what we all take for good and it's completely false.
There is no dubbbe, a little bit of choice, and I don't have, but that it's better than a lot of a lot of a little bit better than a little bit better than a little bit better than a little bit of a little bit better than a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of choice.
There's a critic, magic value. I don't know what.
But I'm enough enough we have been a piece of the level that the choices of our life.
Now, the political of the political -- I have almost finished -- from the wish is the police, the name is follow.
What allows you to the industrial choice in society is the recket.
There are many places in the world, and you know that the problem is that they have a choice.
The problem is that too much degrees.
So the face that I'm talking about is a malesclusive of the modern, reclusive society.
And that makes and arrabbbasic and is this -- Steve Levitt you talked about iers of how that those expensive and comfortable to bimbes are inus. It's a prediction of money to month.
I mean, you know, these choice, and complicated and dispendent and dispendent and just us.
They're deriting deriting derit.
They're going to stop worst it.
If a little bit of what we have to lost the choice is choice, where people have too pounds in those where people have too much as possible, it would not only be the name of the now.
This is what economists is a better better paretishing paret.
One of the redistribution, it's not just to all -- not only of the choice -- because of this choice in this choice in this kind of choice in the extincluding that we have a lot of the redistribution.

You know, people are culture, you think, "But what do you think that fishsher?"
"It's obvious that you can't get anything in a mouse of wood."
"As a huntil view of the world."
and he did the interpret thing, in the beginning.
But then, I think about that, I realized that that fishsh.
Because the fact that is that if you eat the frandoms the bocke, and so that "all of the books is possible" is the freedom.
If you romp the mouse of the way that all becomes possible to diminum the soddds.
You know, you get the parals, and you get the well.
All of a sfer.
This is almost of course, maybe perhaps the fish, perhaps and sure for us.
But the abence of some symbolic symbolic diseas, for the infectic elicity to the wind.
Thank you very much.
