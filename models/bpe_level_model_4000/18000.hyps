And I went last year I showed these slides to show that the glacial calote, which for almost three million years has been the size of the 48 million years has been stretch of the United States of the 40-percent.
But this undervalue the gravity of the problem because it doesn't show the exhibition of the ice problem because it doesn't show the ice of the ice.
The artic calotter is in a sense, the heart customer of the global climate system.
It expandes and return it into the summer of the summer of the summer of the summer and return it into the extinct.
The next deapositive will be a quick carred, the sent fast of the last 25 years.
The ice lost beens are signed in red in red by red.
As you see, they expanding up to the blue scuro.
And that's the ice in inverse that you return into the summer of the summer of the summer in the summer that is the ice in the summer that is the thumb.
You can see the cosident ice cosidential cosident at the cosident -- it's like the blood, which is like the blood of the box.
In 25 years old, it went from like that.
This is a problem because the interest rewarming the falling ground around the ocean where there are huge carbon of coal carbon congeled that, by the proud of the micro-bed microbes.
It turns out to the totality of the atmosphere from global warming, that amount of global warming, that amount of it may double this point of not return this point of not return out out this point of not return out of it.
In some deep in some deep in Alaska metan is already rebolling from the water.

Video: Wow! Al Gore: She is good. The question is if we will be done.
And a reason is that this termal scale of the north scale of the north.
This is a glacial fighting phrase.
And the laughed never reached levels.
This is the fume Kangerlussuaq, in the south.
If you want to know how the sea a level of the sea ice of the sea ice of the ground of the sea.
These are increasing are increasing very quickly.
Another part of the planet: Antartartarcy block of the planet.
The last month of the scientists have degree that the ice of ice is in negative, and that Antartartartarctical Antartartarctical issues on some underwater on the skid in the skies.

Four time sometimes numbered in the last 30 years respect to the previous 75.
This is a game of all insustainable.
If you look at the historical context if you can see the consequences
In the last five years we added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours of the tons in the ocean every day.
Look at attently the area of the East East East, in the west, and both of the subcontinent in the subcontinent where there's a radical impoor in the oceans.
The largest causes of global warming, and the deforestation, which is 20, the use of fuel fuel fuels.
On it is a problem, and the carbon is even worse.
The United States are one of the most emissions, with China.
And it was proposing to build a lot of carbon deal.
But we're looking at a direction of direction.
These are the projects of them are annulled in the past and some evidence of the version of the vere.
On any way, there's a political lottta in our country.
The carbon industry and oil industry has spent 250 million dollars in the last year for the carbon to promote the carbon dioxymore.
That image me to tell me something,
Veras Natral in Tennessee, where I lived a 3.8 billion liters of coal gallallons of carbon gallons of carbon gallons of coal scrate.
Maybe you saw it on the news news news
This is the second largest flower of scale in America.
It happened around Natal.
The natalization of one of the carbon industry was this.
Video: Health Frosty the carbon is a kind of coalee and happy.
It's abundant here in America, and it makes our economy.
Frosty the carbon is more and more cleaner and more cleaner and more cleaner and more cleaner and more cleaner and more cleaner and more cleaner and more cleaner.
It's a good price, adorables and workers are their own own the stuck of their own own south.
Al Gor: From this is a lot of coal West Virginia.

Al Gore: So the Alleance for the Clima Protetion has two campaign.
This is a bunch of it, a part.
Video: Ate: Alla COALergives we see the climatics of climate changes like a night-threat to our business.
For this first is to invest a great amount of money in a very high school in a soul soul to make public and confused the truth of the coal of the coal of the carbon in the cost of the money in a south.
In fact, the carbon is not sport.
We think it's cleaned -- it also a good profume.
So not predicted.
Let me do it.
Video: Attor: Carbone can be talking a lot of it.
So let's do it a whole pattern in a structure of the column as it as a column as it as a carbon as a carbon as a coal.
Straordinary, cars are a little road of wheels -- but this is the sound of the carbon technology of the carbon and the coal technology of it.
The carbon is between the main causes of global warming, but the night of the carbon wild technology that you can see it change.
Take a eye of the carbon deherent technology.
Al Gore: Infind, the positive alternative to connect to the economic question, and the national.
Video: Comment: The America is in crisi; the economy, the national security crisis.
The file that lines all the is: our dependence from fossil fuels, like the fuel and oil oil oil oil oil and oil oil oil oil oil oil
Now, yet, there's a new solution for user to use it.
Repower -- 100 percent of the clean energy in 10 years.
A plan to reput the America to work, to make us sure sure and help us to help the global warming.
Finally, a solution that basts to solve our problems.
Repower America. Scover more.
Al Gor: This is the ultimate of the last one.
Video: Health is to reach America.
One of the fastest ways of bring to the finally dependence from combuster to kill our planet.

It makes them a lot of the investment for a lot of work ben retribes to work ben retribes.
Comment: Repower America. It's time to be realists.
Al Gore: A proverbio African old proverbio in the Gor: "If you want to go fast,
If you want to go away away from the soul together."
We need to go away away fast.
Thank you very much.
Last year at TED I did a introduction on the LHC.
And I promise to return to the back to you about how the machine works.
So I mean, this is the most time I don't have the mocent of the most scientific experiment, the most scientific experiment, or a thousand miles of a circcle.
His the job is to reach the conditions that were less than a billion years of a billion years of the universe -- until 600 million times a second.
All this is just the environment.
This is the car below the machine here.
Let's make these min-Big Bang in the detectors.
This is what I work on. It's called AS -- it's largo 44 meters and has a 22 feet and has a 2,000 feet and a 2,000 feet.
This is a spectacular image of ATLS in built so you can notice the proportion in the proportion of it.
The 10 sect secember we last year we have accesor the first time.
And this was taken by ATLAS.
It was because of immense in the room in the healthy healthy of the control.
It's a picture of the first fashion particles that had all the around the LHC, entertaining in collision, deliberately, with a part of the LHC, and spread particles inside the detect in the detect of the LHC, and it turns out into the detect of the LHC
In other words, when we saw that image the 10 sect secember, we realized that the machine was a great living.
I don't know if it was this to do more than that, when somebody went on to Google and vide that the beginning was this.
That means that we have a cultural impact,
About a week later, it was a problem with the machine, it was just to these files here -- these files here -- these films -- this films.
These files bring 13,000 prints when the car works at the massive of the power.
Now, the technical technical files of you will look at the files and did, "It's not true.
And instead they can do it because they are very cosident cosident films.
So, at least 271 degrees, a degrees, to a inference to that of the space between the stars, and they can bring that to the current of the space between the stellellow of the space,
In one of the junctures in the most of the magneti in LHC, there was a frack of fence fraction of fracation.
So the filmes will be reading to read it and 13,000 printing bought a electrical resistance.
This was the result.
Now, this is still more impressive if you think that these magnets, the fish more than 20 tons in it, and that have been moving out of about 30 centimeters.
They are damaged about 50 magnets.
We had to get them to get them to get them to do it.
We have repristined and cousted it.
Now they're coming back to their underneath place.
By the end of the end of the mark of the LHC will be new intea.
And we expect it, and we expect to get the right data to get to jugger or him, and continue that our avventure to discover what are the morning, the morning, which is the universe.
Now, of course, in a certain quote, these accidents reaccendate the debate on the value of science and engineering. It's easy to confuting.
I think that the fact that it's so difficult to go beyons, I think this is the value of things like LHC.
I want to end up with the words of a scientist Inglese scientist Humphrey Davy, where, I guy, in defended defended with his pupill, his pupill, his pupill, he said, "No is a lot of the human mind, which is so dangerous for human mind, which is how much dangerous the ideas of the human mind, which is defines of our trionfes are mysteries in nature of the world."
Thank you.
I want to start asking you to rethink about how to be children, you play the couknal cooking.
As you understand how to reach them and make them them and make them move them and move them and move them and sold them to think and sold problems and resolving problems and space.
The space reasoning is deeply connected to the way we understand most of the world around us.
So, from informatic inspired by the useful of our interaction with physics, and I started to my Pac, and my Jeevan Kalanithi, I started asking said, "And when we use a computer, instead of having the only one of the way that you can only be a computer, instead of the only one of the digital as a digital polymer that you can get on a digital information with both of the information to a information with both of a digital mouse to a information
and systems our pleasure to our pleasure to feed?
And the question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer, building the answer, building the Siftable.
In a way, a Siftable is a whole computer interactive as a bisco.
In a way, a Siftable is a whole computer interactive as a bisco.
You can move with the hand the hand they can see their own movement and they feel the right movement and they have a pattern and a wireless-wireless-wirelessly.
But most of course, they're physically physics, as the morning, you can just move on to the morning, you can just move to the round of it.
The Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem for a new ecosystem to manipulate information digital information.
And as they become more physics, you know, you know about the movement, the other, and as they get more physics, and as they get more physics, you know, others, how we move them to the new fun and the fun of the fun of the whole fun of interaction of interaction of interaction.
He started with some simple example.
This Siftable is configured to show the vide: if you include it in a direction, the rooters like that, if you including it from the other hand, you know,
These interactive ritory ritory reportraise of others.
If they are interested in what they are interested in what they are intold.
If they come out of it, they notice and they can grow a little bit of it.
If they come out of it, they notice and they can grow a little bit of it.
They also have their movement.
And then we realized that one of the interesting interesting interesting interaction was the common to use the common on dates, for example, "vers" a bultimate as if it was a liquid.
In this case, we have three Sifty configured as a seats and I can use them to be the color in the central color in the central of the color in the middle of the color in the middle of the color in the case,
and I can use them to be using them to the color in the central color, where they missing it.
If we can get too too much of it.
And there are also good possibility of appractice as langues, the mathematics and math where people can try to try the fast things and see the results of the things and you see the results of the logical things and you can be immediately.
Now I'm --
This is a Fibonacy of the Fibonacy program.
So here we have a words of words that is in the Scarabeo and Boggle.
Mosically, every turning of a literal case on every Siftable, Pratictable, Pratically, every turnns, and while you try to get a little bit about a comporate in the dictionary.
And then after about 30 seconds of the remiss and you have a new set of reading and new possibility to try to read.
Thank you.
So here are the children in the Media Lab, I did it in a way that I tried them and I went a video.
They have a lot of them very fliked a lot of it.
And one of the interesting things about this gene is that you don't have to give you many educational people in the many educational people
You just say, "He," and they know exactly what to do.
That's what other people who try it.
This is our beta young, young people who are on the way on the road.
It actually wanted to be employees.
They only were morning, for him.
Now, this is a apply of a interactive.
We wanted to build a tool for the folded by the lingue of the lingue Lui is Felix.
It can insert new characters in the scene, solliant to the Siftable to be able to be able to get new characters.
It can insert new characters in the scene, solliant to the Siftable to be able to be able to get new characters.
So it's doing the sun of the sun
Video: The only is surging.
David Merrill: Now it took a treatment in the scene.
Video: The arancient treatment.
Bel work!
So when you get the Siftable and put it close to the characters --
Video: Bau!
-- by by the story.
Video: Ho!
DM: It's a story with the open-up story with the open-up as you know.
DM: It's a story with the open-up story with the open-up as you know.
Video: Volua, chat.
DM: The last example I have time to show you is a device to show you is a recently fold, to sampling and exeguing music.
It's a tool, made recently, to sample, to sampling and exeguing music.
The Siftable here act from sounds like based and bacteria --
Each one of these has four different variations, and you can choose what you use using.
You can insert these sounds in a compounds in a compounds of your pleasure.
And it just modifice it just touch a sound."
These are actually that you can control from the live, as the revere and filtrouble film.
And it turns out to a particular sound and then including them to the south.
And then there are the effects like time and volume, which you apply to the whole sequence.
Let's look at how it works.
Video: M: We will start putting a basic in two Siftable in two Sift," we go into a serie, the way we go in a serie, we add up in a seriously.
I now put a line of blow.
Video: DM: Now I put some of ussionate --
Video: DM: And I'm going to put the bacteria, so I can control the effect of the live.
Video: I can speak to the entire sequence on the sequence by a bunch or from the other.
Video: DM: And I'm going to add the bottom to give more expression.
Video: DM: I can recombined the sequence """vole."
So I didn't have to planning the first one I can improve it longer or more cort.
And now, finally, I can smoke the entire sequence of the left the Siftable to the left the Siftable to the Siftable to the entire Redwood.
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is to build new interfaces more like how they work as well.
And today, I've had time to show you one of the results of this lost and some possibilities that we try to bring out of the lab.
The concept I want to transmit is that it's coming this new generation of designed designed to interact with digital media media that will bring information in our world in the way we want.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the time to talk to all of you.
I'm a write writing about it.
And I would like to be books is my professional exsion is more than that.
It's also love and the fall of my life.
And I don't expect to change it.
But that, something especially happened recently in my life and my career and in my career that took me to realibrate the whole report.
And the particular thing I recently recently wrote this wheel, this biography called "Mangia, Prega, which is a very big prious previous precedent books, for some reason she went to a great degrees -- and he got a great coast, sensely conditional interactly.
And the result is that everywhere you go to me as if I was condanned to me as if I was convicted by the way of them like the fossil is that everywhwhere.
It is -- condannata!
They all worried now all worried and they said, "You don't fear you you can't do anymore to do than a better better better than to do that?
You don't fear to continue to write for all the life without any more to be able to create a book that can match someon?"
that could match somebody?"
It's reashion and it knows.
But it could go worse -- I remember that more than 20 years ago, when I started to tell people -- I was a trained adolescent -- I wanted to be a write in the worse -- I wanted to be a write write in the worse of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the miles, I was a little bit more than 20 years ago, when I started to tell people -- I was a write of the most of the most of 20
I would go to the same based on the same fear.
And people said, "Don't you have successful?
You don't fear that the humble refute you kill?
You don't give you to do this mestiate for all the life without any of the liver that you ever come out and die of a saming of saming sus?"
So, you know.
The answer -- the short response to all these questions is: "Yes."
I have about all those things.
I always had fear.
And I also have a lot of other things that people can't instruct.
As the algas and other things like that.
But as I think about the writing what I thought and I would ask me the very timate is why is that?
Is it rational?
It's logical that anyone who should expect to be spent by a job that you feel about it.
But what is that particularly in the imprese creative to make us nervous about the mind, which other careful than other career than other careful careful in a way that other careful to you can't do that?
As my father, for him was a chimical engineer and I don't remember one time in his 40 years of activity when he was asked if it was asked if it was asked if it was asked if it was asked if it was a chance?
It wasn't -- that block of engineer how do you walk at the engineer
It wasn't worked like this, you know?
Only, chemicals like a group of chemical engineers like they don't have certainly the reputation of being a bunch of being a way of depressent to be a depressent depressing.
We writers, we have enough this reputation and not only writers but creatives of all these reputation of being enormous reputation of being enormously instabmented by mindsous.
And it's not another that look at the content of the magnificent death of the magnificent death that creative moral death that only in the twentieth century, and often for them.
And the ones that don't have to be really seem to be really disappeared by their woman.
Norman Mailer, before I did, in the last interview said, ""I'm killed a little bit more more." And he killed me a little bit more more than the job of their lives.
But we don't get to say because we feel like to say because we heard these things like this is very long as you have completely interiored and accepty the notion and suffering, and the notion are somehow you read and the art, and the art, and the art, and it will always be somehow relatively you can get to the hangoat.
And the question I want to bring to all of this thing today is you agree with this idea?
And it goes to you know, because you look at this thing -- because you look at me not for this guess is not good for this supposed to do this suppose in this suppose of this guess.
I think it's odied.
And I think it's also dangerouse and I don't want to see the perpetuated in the next century.
I think it's better to encouraging our great minds creative mind.
And because I know that in my case -- in my case -- in my case -- it would be very dangerous to start out to the constitude in the constitude of the circumstances that are in my career.
Or it's really -- unlike you look at it, I'm pretty young people, I've got about 40 years.
I have about four decade of work in me.
And it's very likely that anything about now in the world will be right by the world as the work that used to be right by the world as the work that used to be in my last book.
He slavery, because we are all more or less friends here -- it's likely to be the most successful one of my sheep.
Oh, Gesood, which think!
You know this is the kind of thinking that leads a person to start to start to be, and I don't want to do that.
I would continue to do this work that we do.
So, the question becomes it like, "?
And so I would alsemble, after many reflection that the way of work to continue to write is to create a psychological costruck costruck it, right?
I have to find a few way to find a safety distance between me, which I'm writing and my natural anxious anxious goal, as I was trying to get to look for all the last year models I started looking through the time, trying to find other society to see if they could have the best ideas to get better ideas and more health health and more blood and more health health and more blood and more health and more blood and more blood to get a lot of the blood of the most bab
as you can help people creative to manage inherent inerent risks of creativity.
And that research took me to the Great and ancient Roome.
See because it goes back to the circle and then back back back back back.
In the ancient Greek and ancient Rome -- people didn't seem to believe that creativity came to man, OK?
It was thought that creativity was this spirit was this spirit and who came from a few surprising and unknown and unknown and unknown and unknown and unknown and unknown and unknown and unknown and unknown and unknown and unknown and unknowing it.
The green was called these demonizes of creativity of creativity "demoni,"
Socrate, wonderful, he believed that they had a demic that elder-hgem that heavy.
The Romans, were the same idea, but they call that that kind of spirit without a genium.
And the Romans, because Romans, they didn't think that a genius was a particular genius was kind of intelligence --
They believed that a genius was this kind of divine entity that creates was literally in the study of a little bit like the Dobby, and who came out of the Dobby, and who came out of the cool of the artick and the result of that work.
Ecceptional -- -- -- -- -- -- that is the distance of which is that the psychological costructure.
And everyone knew that it was so that it works, right?
So the antic artists were protsed by certain things, like you for example, the too narcissm, right?
If your job was exceptional, you couldn't take it all the ded, all of them were helped by this genius to be helped by this genius incorporea.
If your work fail, it wasn't all the whole bought -- right?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be a inable,
And so the people han conceived the creativity in Occident for a long time.
And then the Rindication came and everything changed this great idea, and we put this great idea, we put the human being in the middle of the universe and the mysteries and mysteries that write devices.
This was the principle of humans rational human and people started thinking about that creativity came from the hydrops.
And for the first time in history, you start to start this or a falling that arts like a genius rather than a person with a genius of genius.
And I must tell you, I think it was a big error.
I think that allowed someone to believe that a simple person to believe that being like a recicipe as a recipe as a recipe of all the mysteries of all the mysterious mysteries a very much too big to give to the fragile of the fragile that human.
It's like to ask someone to ingoid the sun
It makes a completely foldly the ego and creates all these ingestiable ingestiable ingestive on the lost of the performance.
And I think it was this pressure that they destruct the artists in the past 500 years.
And, if this is true, and I think that the question is becoming in, and you?
Can we do it different?
And you can go back to a more ancient understanding of the relationship between humans and creative mystery creative mystery of the relationship between humans and creative mystery of the relationship between humans and creative mystery of the relationship between humans and mystery of the relationship between humans and creative mystery of the most ancient of the relationship between humans and mystery of the relationship between humans and mystery
Or maybe no.
Maybe we can't cell 500 years of thinking about a very rational thinking,
And you probably have people between the audience that would suspect of scientific suspects about the notion of the notion of the nice of the nice of the nice of the same falling on their projects.
I probably won't convince you all about this thing.
But the question I want to bring is -- why is it -- why now?
Why don't you think about this in this way?
Because it has more sense of any other thing that I've ever heard about the exhise of creative processes of creative process.
One thing that you ever have to do something -- so fundamentally, all here -- so fundamentally, all here -- yeasily.
And, in fact, it can be completely paranormal.
I did this recently recently with the extraordinary poetry Ruth Stone, who has now 90 years, but that was a poetry for me that in his childhood in his childhood in the Virginia, he worked out in the camps, he was working out in the camps, and I felt it from the exploitself from the explounted to the explode the exployed.
She said that it was like a fragorous fragorous frage of air.
And that came to rotolating in her landscape.
It feels come to the way that it was going to take the land below the land below its feet.
He knew that you have one thing to do to do that point and it was like, "current."
And it goes to the house and it was following from this poetpoesia, and it would not have to take a piece of paper and a mattered pretty quickly as the train and the train the paper on the page.
Sometimes it can't be quite quickly, so it was very quickly, so correct and correcent and correcent it without able to get in home and she was going to stay through and she kept heaven, and it would continued to roll through the landscape, as she said, "another poet."
And then there were -- this piece I don't forget it -- there were moments where the was almost lost of the time was almost lost of it, right?
So, she was running at the house and he was trying to card the career and it was a marg in the time she was going on, and then he said, it was like you the other hand the off.
He was the poesia from and the tail and it in his body and the transmitted it in his body and translate it in his body and translate it in his body and the transmittonight.
And in these halls, the poem would be presented on the perfect paper and intact, from the last word at the first word at the first word at the first word at the first word at the first of the first word at the first of the last word at the first word at the first one of the first word at the first one of the first one and intattached in the first one of the poesia would be presented on the first of the first one and intact on the first four.
So when you feel the feels -- it's crazy -- it's kind of the creative process.
Not my creative process, it's not a conductured -- I'm not a conductured it!
I'm a mult, and my way of work is -- sweat me to be able to go to the same orary every day and go around and go out and go out and go up and go out and go out and go up and go up and go up and go out of it.
But even I stand in my head, I have a cheap against that thing, in the time.
And I imagine that many of you have a face.
You know, even if the work and the ideas came to me from a certain source of a certain source I couldn't honestly know.
And what is this thing about that?
And how can we relate to it in a way to not lose the head, but please, which is it going to be slow?
As I think about it, the best example of me, the contemporary example that I have is the musician in Tom Waits, which I interview, I interview,
We were talking about this, and you know, Tom, you know, Tom, for the most life was the incarnation of the artist of the article of the emporary impull of creatives of the creatives of the creatives of the whole whole iorized.
But then you get to calculate and a day while she was driving on a whereas she was driving on a road in Los Angeles, she changed all for him.
She was going fast, and all of a sea a very sent this little framtion of a melodia, which comes in his head, as it makes the inspiration, elder's wonderful, you know, it's wonderful, and the wish, you know, it's wonderful, and the wish, but it doesn't know how to take it.
It doesn't have a piece of paper -- it doesn't have a math record -- it doesn't have a record record --
So it starts to feel this kind of old anxious growing in him in his guys, "I'm going to lose and remarrushed by this lost song from this lost song from this lost seed by this kind of a lose seed by this kind of old anxymer to be growing in this kind of old anxious old in the guy of old anxious old in the guy of the old anxious.
I'm not quite good and I can't do it."
And instead of going to go into the panic of the panic of the pania,
He just got the whole process of mind, and he did something again.
He just watched the sky and said, "Cus," you can't see that I'm driving you?"
"Do you look like it can write a song hon?
If you really want to be there, you get to a more opport, you get to take a current of you.
On the triments, you know, you get someone else today.
You go to disturbing Leonard Cohen."
And his work changed process.
I don't work was the work of the job was still like that.
But the process, the fishing ry, which was released when the genius, the genius that was released when the genius was going to be a little bit of the problems and free from where I was happening that didn't have to be a whole thing.
but he knows this peculiar bizarre whizarm a conversation between Tom and this strange thing that he didn't have Tom.
So how much the story that I felt the way I was working and I was just a little bit of a little bit of a time.
This idea, I was saving when I was writing "Mangia, Prega, Amaa," and falling in one of the disperation where we are working on on something and we can't start thinking that it's going to be a saster, which is going to be the worst book that will be the worst book ever written a bit of a written book ever written a little bit about the worst book about the worst book that you would be the worst book
Not just a good worst book written a book written about it.
And I started thinking about object like this.
But then I reminded me from Tom and try and try and heres.
So I went to my face in the hands of the manufacty and direct my comments to a vacuum of the room.
And I said, "You know, what you know is, you know that if this book will not be brilliant will not be brilliant to me, right?
Because as I see that I'm putting all that I haven't more than that.
So if you want to be better you to present you and do your parts.
Okay. But if you don't do it, you know it, you know, I don't know it free.
I'm going to write the same because it's my work.
And I'd like to do that was registered to be recorded to do my part, because I was like, "Finally, it's like, "Oh, thoh, you -- the sixth of North Africa in the North people who was used for the lack of the dances of the dances and the music that were going to be on for the wild and the wild to the walk up to the bea.
And they were always magnificent because the ballers were fantastic.
But every tant, I mean, something happened, and one of these artists became actually transending.
And I know that you know what I know about what I know is all about a certain point, a certain point, a certain point, a little bit like that.
It was like the time you stop and the ballery walks through a kind of laps and she wasn't fun from the sun of the sun of the sun of the sun of the soul --
And suddenly it doesn't look like a human as a human human being.
But you access from divince and under illuminated in the device.
And when this happened, the people knew what was -- they knew what was -- they called him with his name.
They had the hands and started to meeting, "Allah, Allah, God God, God God, God God, God, God, God."
This is God, you know.
Curious nice -- when the More the Spaper per in Spain, they took this abitude with their and the ready ready to be in the century of the Spaper in in the seat, "Allah, he," you can be in the fam, "You know, you still feel in the fam.
In Spaper per in Spaper has done something impossible and magic said, "Allah, magnifie, Allah, magnifie, and he said, "Hey, it fell in God's last of God.
And it's great, because we need it.
But the problem comes the problem comes up the day later, for the baller's same, when you get up and discovered that are 11 in the morning, and the Dod is not morning, there is no more.
It's just a mortal with great male with the knee, and maybe it will never be more to each other.
And maybe nobody will give the name of God still as the God still as the rest of his lives?
It's difficult to it.
This is one of the most painful reaction to make a creative life creative life.
But maybe it doesn't have to be so angoating, if you can not believe that it doesn't believe it, but for the most extraordinary of your being come from you yourself.
But credit you are actually actually actually the data from a imaginable imaginable of this team of this team of your life that you have to go to somebody.
And, you know, if we think about this whole change.
And so I started thinking about it, and it's sure as I thought for a few months during the work that I think about the work that I think about the work that I will prestate, the dangerous, and I was very very success.
And what I have to continue to tell me when I feel electrized by this is, not fold.
Not it just just your work.
It goes to presents for your parts, whatever it can be.
If your job is ball, ball.
If the divin, I assumpting the device, and I decided to let me scorgeous some kind of wonderful for a time through your soul sfor, then "O!"
On the same thing you have the dance.
And "Oh, it is now."
I think I think I have to teach it.
"Yes!" And it is just for the human and testing and tests to take a lot of talks to be continuously presenting to keep up to a continuously.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
As you know I've been talking about some of these projects on the genome of these projects on the genomes.
Now we're starting a new percorn: we started a new biologist and now starting to the biology and now from that digital code we are both in a new fashion biology, designing and synthesizing life.
We always tried to bring big questions.
"What is the vite is something that many biologists I think they have attempt to understand the levels.
We tried a different approach, reducing the minimes of terms.
We're digitalizing almost 20 years old.
When we sequenced the human genome was treated by the world's analogy of biology in the digital world of the computer.
Now we ask us to do it regenerate life to this digital universe from this digital universe from this digital universe
This is the map of a little organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, which is the kind of the genome of the most little between those that can cars in the lab of the most little organisms,
And we tried to reduce the genome to create one more little bit more little bit.
We can get a hundred to genes of genes about 500 that are here.
But when we take a chock to his metabolic map is relatively easy to the nostr.
I believe, this is simple.
But when you look at all the genes that we can eliminate it, one of the time, it's very unlikely that this can bring a vivision.
So we decided that the only way to progression was synthesize this chromosomes in a way of the modifying the components to bring some of these fundamental questions.
And so we started the way the "Can we can synthesize a chromoso?"
Can the chemicals convent to produce these great molecules that never been able to create before I haven't been able to create before you?
And, in case of the business, we can make a chromoso?
A chromosome is just a piece of chemical material in it.
The speed that we can digitalize life is growing in the life is growing to exponential res.
Our ability to write the genetic code, ages, it progressive progression of mind, but it's better.
And our most recently resulted the door to a exponential curve.
We started more than 15 years ago.
And the process has required a lot of the taboetic revision before we started the first experiments.
But we found out that synthesize DNA is very difficult to it.
There are tens of thousands of cars in the world that make little segment little segment of DNA, the long-beaten proces: the most selected proces: the most selected is long, more errors us.
So we had to develop a new method to assemble these framatically and regging the errors and reaching the errors and the errors of the errors and reaching the errors and reaching the errors and reaching the errors and reaching the errors and reaching the errors and reaching the errors and
And this was our first attemptative, starting from the digital information of the genome of the genome of the genome of the Phi 174.
It's a little virus that kills bacteria kills.
We designed the framments, effectively the reeffort the report of the errors and I got a molecule,
And the interesting part of it is when we took this piece of chemical material that is inherent in the bacteria started reading this genetic code and produce the particles started reading this genetic code and produce the virals.
The virals have been release from the cell phone, are coming back and they have destroyed the E.
I talked about recent recent with the petroping industry said that their own that they have certainly comfortable this model.
They have a more than you.
We believe that this is a situation where the software can really build his own hardware in a biologist.
But we wanted to do the biggest things in the biggest thing.
We wanted to build the entire chromosome.
They're more than 580 mile beat.
So we thought we build it in the size of virus, so that we could change the cassets to figure out what the components are the component of a viventure cell in the viventure of the viventure of the virus, so we could change the vidous.
The designation is crucial and if we start with digital information in a computer, these must be very accurated.
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 the standard accurateless was of a mistake for every 10 mibasis.
We found resequence to resequence 30 errors that original sequence that original sequence will never be able to do it work.
One part of the process is designing segment for a long time to be able to be segent with all the other segment of 50 letters to build underunity that they were able to build smaller subunity that they were able to make a little bit smaller than the work work together.
We try to get one here.
You probably have a bed that we insert that we insert the flights of the big.
Think of this is: We have a genetic code on four literally literally code and T.
Three of the reading together with about 20 love love love about 20 love love and a specific order of reading for every love for every love for every love love for every love love love for every love loca.
So we can use the genetic code, you guys do it, you know, you think about it.
What we did in the beginning was self-to do with it.
Some people have been dolphuses from the fact that it wasn't poeted.
We designed these segments for a few of them just to unique with essentially unique.
There are the imming them and they put them up and put them up and asyme.
And we started to start with the parts, starting with segment segment segments from five to miles, you know, you can be forming segments in their letter to reach 72 miles, and they were literally to reach 72 letter to reach.
On all past we made these segments in these sitting so that we are trying to make them very robate proceing to create a very robate procept robs -- as you will see in a minute.
We're trying to automatization the process.
So, this seems the tabellon a baket.
When we get to these very long, more than 100 mile -- more than 100 mile mile -- it will not grow more directly in E.
You get to the modern limits of the molecule.
So we considered other mechanismmies.
We knew about another mechanism called a homologist called recombination recombination that in biology uses to repair the DNA to unique to repair the DNA to unique in the segments.
So this is an example.
This organism, called Deinococcus radioduce -- it can absorb three million rads radiation.
You can see in the square the square foline as his chromosome.
In 12 -- 24 hours comes up as it was before.
There's a thousand organisms that can do that.
These organisms can check completely.
They can live under empty.
I'm absolutely sure that life is in space, and you get suspect for new rich environments of water.
And in the real NASA showed that this avail.
This is a picture of the molecule, we built these process, just using these process, just using the lights of the segment of the segment of inserious segments.
The lightforeign them all of the automatically.
This image wasn't taken with a electron with a electron microscope with a regular microscope to the regulate microscope to it.
It's a molecule, so the great that we can see it with a microscope with a little bit of readery.
These are pictures that cover a period of about six seconds.
This is the publishing that we did very little time ago.
They're more than 58,000 letters reading of genetic code.
It's the largest molecule, which was a framed by man.
It has a lot of ecolating fish.
If we stamp it with a 10 without spaces, it would like 142 pages only 142 pages only to turn this this genetic code.
Now, how do we work? How do we make it work?
Obviously, you get a virus is a game by girls.
It's a little more complicated when they use of bacteria as they use the bacteria
It's easier when it's the eucariote as the eucariote as ourselves, you can just get the nucleus and insert one one one of them else, which is basically the process of clonation.
In the bacteria archaea is instead of integrated inside the cell -- but we recently showed that we can do a birthday that we can do a birthday and a fally of a cell and activity it.
We can refted a chromosometimes
The two are different as the way of the toss of the topis.
We put a few gene gene in a way that we could decide what to choose for this chromosoon.
And then it took the blood with the ince in a way to kill all the proteins.
And when we put it into the cell was stupend -- and you open our graphic dealing our graphic defy -- the new chromosome was going to the cell phone.
And we were really thinking that we couldn't go to the tre, but we tried it in the spingerity of the way in there.
This is one of the most mectural mechanisms of evolution.
We found that a very many species have added a second or a third of a third romosomt in a second thousand new tratts of the new tratts of that species.
So who think about evolution as a only gene to the time that you modic modiphic doesn't understand the biologist of the biology.
There's a matter of the imations called "restription is that address from the DNA.
The covery that it was in the cell of it could not be a one.
The cell pha-tail-tails that we inseritos.
It turns out the other and has recognized the other chromosome, as a low-rane," and we were return up with only the cell and the new courage and the new coil.
It became blue because of genes that we have inserved.
And in a short of time, all the characteristics of a species, you go lost of a species, and it turned out of all over a species, based on the new software that we insert in the cell phone in the cell phone in a short of the kind of lash --
All the protein is changed, member are changed, and when we read the genetic code, and when we read the genetic code,
Now, this could look at the genetic alchemia als, but altering the software we can change things in a pretty replace.
Now, I've already explained that this is not about genes: but progress from three million years and a half a million years and a half a thousand a half million years and a half a million years and a half a million years of this digital explosion of the Cambrian explosion of this digital process.
Why do that?
I think it's pretty obvious when we think about our needs.
We're going to go from six billion and a half billion people in the next 40 years.
Just to give you an example: I am born in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for each one existing in 1946; in 40 years, there will be four years, there will be four of them will be four of the planet for each other.
We're going to find the problems now to find food, water and cleaning and cleaning medicine for six billion and a half billion people.
It will be more harmer to do it for nine billion.
We use more than five billion carbon barrels of carbon barrels.
That means a million barrels a day.
When we try to find biological processes or whatever the kind of process to remise them, it's going to be a huge challenge.
We have to keep out of all the way we have to get the CO2 from these materials that end up in the atmosphere.
On day, thank you to the scientific discoveries that all over the world, we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I like to think that are designed for the future.
The electric industry has only a dozen about components, and think about how many different things have come out of it.
Our limits of the limits are the reality of our imagination and our imagination.
Now we have the techniques of the rapid of the rapid synthesization in the combinatory methetods of the combinator.
We can build a big robot, robots that can produce a million chromosomes a million chromosomes a day.
Think of processes 20 million genes or try to optimize the processes to try and optimize the processes or drug vaccines, we can change a little team, and create more biology now that in the last 20 years of science.
And it's just a standard selection selection selection selection.
We can choose for the possibility of surviving, chemistry or carbon vaccine vaccine vacuum blow.
This is a instantanea of software programmed that we're working for being able to be able to sit and designing special species.
Well, we don't know how much they will be done.
We know exactly what their genetic code.
Now we're focusing on fourth of generation.
You also see you that you can get to ethanol from the grate was a mouthanol experiment.
We have carbon on on the third generation that will use enough to be prazed by the cooker as the oth-higher than a either different kinds of throw or different kinds of throw --
But the only way the biology can have a great impact without increasing more than the cost of food and limiting the cost of the food and limiting the availability would be transforming the first column CO2 in materials that can reach this purpose this purpose and we are able to be able to be able to be able to be able to reach this discovery.
And the only combined light with CO2 is a metodox -- but in our discoveries in the world, we found different methods.
This is a organism that we described in 1996.
It lives in the deep ocean to about 2,500 feet of the water's temperature of the water.
It creates metan from CO2 using hydrogen hydrogen molecular as a source of energy.
We're trying to figure out if we can inch the CO2, which can easily be transported by tubes, converting that CO2 in carbon in carburing this process.
So we think about a short we might be able to increase what the question of "What is the life."
Eastly. If you can't do it from TED, where can you do that?
It would be a main of energy source.
And so we're working on the same metods to use the metods to create vaccine vaccine vaccine in the same methods to create vaccine vaccine to the same metods to create vaccine to create vaccine vaccine to create vaccines to make vaccine vaccine to the same metods to the same metoid of the same metos.
You saw this year with the influence, we are always behind a year and a dollar, less when it comes to find the right vaccine falling the right vaccine falling the right vaccine vaccine of the year and a dollar.
I think that what you can change in combinables in a combinable vaccine in anticipt.
So that's how the future could start to look at how to look at the evolution, accelerating the evolution of the evolution with bacteria and finally cells and finally cells and finally cells --
We are so much as it turns out to get people.
Our purpose is to do it in a way of living enough to try to try to try to try to get it. Thank you very much.
First of all you can see, the fastest as possible, a few fundamental job of the new technology that we took to the Microsoft in a year a very exactly. This is Seadragon.
It's a local environment, which you can interact is at a local level that remote with a huge amount of visual data here.
We're seeing a lot of gigabyte of digital photographs with a kind of a kind of zoom and continuous for a speed panoramic zoom and continue, and I mean, you know,
And it doesn't matter how much much the amount of information that we see, how much big these things are these things like the big thing or images.
Most are common photographs, but this for example, this is a provient from the Bible scan-up scansion of Congress, and reenter in the legal game.
It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that limits the prestations of a system like this is the number of pixel in any moment. It's also a very flexible architecture.
This is a whole book of data not imagined by imagines.
This is the Casa desolated of Dickens. Each wonna represents a capitulate capitulous.
And to show you that this is just about testing and not images, we can do something like this, to do something like this, to really show that this is a real representation of the test, not a photoe.
It could be a little bit a little bit of a little artificial book.
It doesn't advice.
This is a more realistic example of the number of the Guardian of the Guardian hit.
Each image is the beginning of a century.
And it really gives you the pleasure of law the beauty version of a magazine version of a five-year-old version of a quote of a meeting.
We also did something with the cornal of this particular number of the Guardian of the Guardian.
We made a fashion advertising a higher of the higher that you use in a normal publishing -- and we insert in the normal content content content ent content ent content ent content ent content ent ent ent of the fasural advertising content in a normal fasold.
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile, you can see here.
Or other models, or even the specific folder techniques.
And this really shows some of these ideas to to get the limits of space on the screen of the screen space.
And we hope that this gentlemifies to the pop-up to some of the similar, you don't have to be necessary.
Of course, the map is one of the most obvious for this kind of technology.
And on this not to say that we have some contributes to say that we have contributed to give it in this field.
These are all the streets in the U.S. soven in a geosphic image of the NASA.
So we're going to go to something else.
This is actually from the vision on the webs; you can go to see it.
This is a project called Photosynth, which fights two different technologies.
One is Seadragon and the other is a very interesting visual computer visual computing from Noah Snavely, a student of the University of Washington, with the aid of Microsoft and of Research of Microsoft of Microsoft Research of Microsoft Microsoft of the Microsoft Snavigate Microsoft Snavigation of the University of
And it's from the vision of the web, managed by Seadragon.
You can see it when we do this kind of pattern, which we can go from one of the way we can go from one and have this kind of experience of the same kind of experience.
But the spacecraft collection of images here has actually a meaning.
The visualization of the computer have registrated these images together, in a way that correspond to the real, in which corresponding to the real, all the way the lagree in the Flagne of the Clagne Grassian artics -- have been taken away. So here you see the elemptable or of imaging or of a slide-stable, or of imaging pleasant or of a slight-stable,
I don't know if I don't know if I don't know if I know if I don't know if I don't know if I don't know if I don't know if I don't know if I don't know if I don't know if I don't know if I don't know if I don't know if I don't know if I don't know if I know if I have time to show you any other environment.
There are a lot more spacecraft of it.
I want to go directly to one of the original data from Noah's original data, and this is from a previous prototype of Photosynthic of the first time last summer -- to show you what I think is really the close of the extra Photosynth. And it's not necessarily so much evident in the environment. And it's not necessarily so evident as well.
We had to worry about the legal aspects and so forth.
This is a rebuild a rebuild a cattedral of Notre Dame images prese from Flickr. Basta Flickr in Flickr and you get imagines of the campines in the cams and so on. Every one of these around, you can see a picture that it has discovered this model.
So they're all images from Flickr and have been all connected to space,
And it is possible to navigate in this very simply way.
You know, I never would have thought of finish to work for Microsoft.
It's very gratify to receive this kind of account here.
I think you can see that this is a lot of different types of falls of falls in the SLR, a phone number meaningful number means, it was a very powerful number of different falls.
And if I can try to try to look at those more stranges.
Most are blocks to face, etc.
Some of this is a series of photographs -- excold.
This is a poster of Notre Dame registered correctly.
We can go from the universe to the physics of this environment.
The essential point is that we can do the things with social environment. This is now taking data from everyone from all of the collective interaction of how to apply the Earth, from visual view -- and all those data together.
All those pictures become connected together, more than the sum of the sum of the sum of the sum of the sum of the sum found.
You have a model of the land of the land of the land of the land of the land of the land --
Think about this as a promote of Stephen Lawler on the Earth virtual Earth.
It's something that growing in complexity as as the people use uses, and the people who uses for the uses of uses to use it to use.
Their photos are sushed by other people.
If you get the idea of contrast all of these sants say my names of the nice of the nice of Notral, sudral of all those dates, and I can use how to sush point of all those dates, and I can use as a point in that space, in that space, and I can use the photos of the type of the type of the kind of red type of the type of the type of the type of the type of the kind of a type of disappleasant sprate of these things that
Of course, a consequence of all of this is extremely elaborate models of all the interesting part of the earth -- you don't only have a lot of folds and a millions, but by the collective memory and a million bunch of the most interesting memory of the most interesting place.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I realized the bene?" What is that your software will you like to do is that in a certain point, in the next years, all photographs of all the photographs of wherever in the world or will be basically connected together?
BAA: Yeah. What is doing is actually discover it.
It's creating hyperlink, if you want to imagine hyperlink,
And it's doing it in the content of the imagines.
And the thing becomes very interesting if you think about the recipe of the very very many of these images of these images possible.
As you do a research of images on the Web, you know, a frack and the text on the page of the picture.
Now, what happens if that picture you connect to all your fell in your picture?
So the amount of the seed: the semantic interconnection and the amount of wealth that comes to a very huge effect.
CA: Blaise, it's really incredible.
BAA: Thank you very much.
One of the pleasure of the pleasant when you travel and one of the inngraphic research is the living between who didn't forget the antic antic of the traditions, between who had the past, the past, the soul in the wind pietrate of the plant pletry.
You know, the thinking that the chamans Jaguar travel even beyond the Milky that the myths of the older of the Inuit is still cover the remained by the Dhar, or in Himalaya, to remember the world the same in the middle of the world in which the world in which the world in which the world in which the world is not in a sense of reality, but it's just a model of reality,
the consequence of a particular set of choice adapt that our stirts of adapts that our stirts of a lot of generations ago.
And, of course, we all share the essential trates.
All of it.
We are subject to start start with.
We need to deal with the inesorability of death you, so we don't take us and balance, and balances --
We all have a art.
What it grows is the particular rate of the dance of the dance of the dance of the dance of all culture.
It doesn't matter that they are the Those are the Borneo, or the following of the Borneo, or the War, or the warriers of the Kaid in Kenya secentonal, or a camelmmaster of Anmmain in in Kenya camel.
He was my company in the desert in a month ago, or a month ago, or a walls of the walls of the Mounm of Everest, the mother of the world.
All of these populations teaching us that there are other ways of thinking about it, other ways of thinking about it, other ways of moving in the world.
And, if you think a moment, it's a concept that can give you hope to give you a hope of it.
Inside, the miriadic of culture of the world creating a spiritual life and cultural that fly aving the planet and cultural is important for the planet as the biosphosphones.
And you can think about this raise as a ethnosphery as a hetnospher's being, and you can call it the total sure, ideas, ideas, inspirations, intuitions that are brought by the human imagination from the human imagination from the human imagination from the tree of the consciously.
The ethnosfast is the fantastic pathrimonize.
It's the symbol of what we are and what we can be in how much inquise.
And because the biosphery was quite consumed as much as it as a fast as a very quickly.
No biologist, for example, it would say that 50 percent of all the species has been or on the earth of the summer -- in the most apocalculation -- in the most apocalittics -- and you don't get close to the most culture -- and you don't get a little bit of the culture -- that the culral diversity -- that the most culral diversity --
The indicate of all of this is, of course, the language of language.
When you're born 6,000 lings, they were 6,000 lings,
One language is not just a composal of a vocabulary of a series of gramatical rules.
One language is the spirit of human spirit of the spirit.
It's the middle of which animates every culture comes in in the material world.
Each language is a forest of mind, a soul thinking, a ecosystem thinking, a ecosystem of the spiritual possibilities.
And of those 6,000 langues, as we are sitting in Monterey, at least half it comes out of the babies.
They don't get to teach children, which means less you camel -- unless than not cambi something, which is already dead.
What is more tristed to be flighted by silence of being the last to talk about a language, the fact that you don't have the saggem of the bunch of the daughters?
This is the gone in a few weeks of the world every two weeks a few weeks a few weeks a little bit of a weeks and brings with the soul s' language.
And I know that someone to say ""Is it better like this?
The world would not be a better place if we talk all the same languages?" Beniso, then we talk all yoruba.
We talk about kogis.
You will be a tract, which means that you can't talk about their language.
I'd like to give you a journey through the ethnosfera's ethnosfera's --
a little journey in the ethnospher's above that we're lost in the ethize.
Many of us forget that when I say "different ways of existing existing in existing in existing in existing in the way.
Let's take for example, this baby baby in Amazony in Amazony, the popular population of anacony, which creates the militty of the lator of the lator of the sacridge of the sacridge.
It's a population that is not able to distinguish the blue column color, because the celeste is identified in the time of the forest whenever they dipends the population of the older courage did, which depends the population of the blue cool cocelest, which is identified in the blue of the blue cool blue cool color in the west of the blue cool cool cool color that is not not able to distingui
They have a strange language and a matrimonial rule, "exogamia said, "Hamia language -- you have to get a person who talks a different language.
All this has radically radically the mitable in the past, yet the particular particular particular family that in these very extinct family maintain marriage that is in the mystical matrimonstrict.
They are limited to listen and then they start talking about it.
Let's take one of the most interesting tribes that I've lived Waorani tribes that I lived the Waorani Ecuador Norder, a incredible population that has the first contatts in 1958.
In 1957 mission to have a contact with a framated.
They made it from the high-photographs that they would reach them in a few that would be loved in a pluvial folded that this population had never seen anything of bi-dimensional pluvial bit.
They raw the pictures from the ground, they turned to the research of a form or a shape or a flowing in the diavoid of the diavoid and they killed the five mission with the bits with les.
But the Waorani didn't just killed the stranimal to the stranimal here.
They killed between each other.
Fify percent of the death was caused by their own stessi.
We are saved to eight generations and we found two natural death and when we found two natural death housing and when we got it for them was invectively that one of them was invective, and then they killed it itself.

To make a sense of the myray I would have to understand the Voun culture and that Voodoo is not a black of black in the mirace.
It's quite a metaphor of a metaphor of the world.
Very interesting.
If you ask you to tell me the great religions of the world, what would I say to do that?
Christian: Islam, Buddismo, Ebraism;
A continent is always left out of it, I think that sub-Saharan Africa has no folded by religious fts of these concepts, and Voodoo is not that the distilled of these very profound religious faces in the diashion slavery of the slavery of slavery in the slavery of slavery.
What makes it interesting the voodoo is the intense relationship between life and death.
So the lives are born to the spirit.
And the spirits can be invocated by Grande Aqua, they respond to the dance of dance, and they replaced themselves to the soul of the vision in a short way for a short time it comes the following becomes the die.
So for this voodooists love to say, "You want to go to close to talk about God.
We give them in the temple and we become God."
And the moment you are possat that you guise that drives you to you, how can you do you do that?
So you get incredible event that these incredible events, following voodoo in the state of the train that touch touch a demonstration of the power of the mind in the power of the mind when it was catalyzed in a state of remaintained remaintains.

It turns out of the ancient civilization that once they lived on the carbolombia in the carbolombia in the conquist, the population of the vulcanic mass that were on the vulcanic floor.
In a jeweled of blood this population never been conqued by the spagnowl.
And in the today, they have governed by a clack but their formation is really extraordinary.
The young followers are taken by the family to three or four years, and they live in a secret in a world of doubio and shake up in the basic flowing for 18 years.
Two terms of nine years of proposited to reduce the nine months of the nine deployees that transmmic is metaphor of the Madre.
For all of this time, they get accultured to the value of their society, values that they preice and only their preice and only their preice and only their preice to say -- or cosmic balance.
At the end of this incredible beginning, they suddenly took out and the first time in their lives, at the age of the first time in the age of consciousness when the sun of the first balls when the sun sun is the sun of the beautiful foldness when the sun is a conference in the conference of this incredible -- and he got a little bit of the first splor. The pret of this incredible starts the splor.
"Right? Proprio like I have detail.
It's stupend. Now it's stupend. It's about protect."
They call them the largest brothers and say that we are the threats of the destruction of the world.
This level of intuition is extremely important.
When we think about the indeed populations and the environment, we invote Rousseau and the old story of the noble noble noble concept of noble now-no-bunch of voices and say, "We are close to the Earth in the Earth of us.
The indees are not feeling about indebed by ourselves from ourselves from ourselves from ourselves from ourselves from ourselves from ourselves from ourselves from ourselves from ourselves from ourselves.
There's no space for these things in the malaric stopped in the gelies of Tibet, but thank you to the time and the reports, they created a mystic of the Earth based on a notion of being conscious conscious conscious conscious conscious intuition of the same way that the Earth can only be the same because it's infused by the human conscious as it as well.

which is the death of a spirit or a mineral is irrieving.
What is interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between the individual world and natural world.
I grew up in the Columbia forests of Britannica creating that the forests had to be cuts.
And that really, it has a fun from my friends who believe that the forest people believe that the forest and the waves are dimore, and the beetry of the wild and the beetry channibal spirits that live in the world that are going to the north of the world who face in the Hamatsa.
If you start to think that these culture can create different reality -- you can start to start to understand some of their feelings.
I took this picture of this picture of the nordoctorky Amazonia nordoctor.
Maybe some of you heard about the ayahuase, the most powerful replacement, the most powerful repertorio of you have been talking about the skiing.
What makes it fascinating the ayahuasing is not the potential for the basic face, but his elaboration. It's composed by two elements.
From a lian lian launch that conties a series of beta-carboline, and harmful and harmful and harmful and hardly falling and a moline, and harmful best.
And by the only plant planta smoke that alters a little bit of the coscicies, but it's measured with the leaves of a coffeeeeeths of a coffee coffee in the coffee of the coffee coffee.
This plant is a powerful powerful powerful powerful powerful to serotonine, a methyltrypty methoxyxyydithoxydithoxyptamines.
If you ever see the Yanomami tiring on the nose of the nose that they make a different set of the species, ancheckydithoxydithoxyltrypty methoxyptamines.
Tiring that poles on the nose is a little bit like being disappeared by a smoking of dipines and landing on a sea a sea of electricity. Reseses: It doesn't believe a degree of reality.
I was often with my professor, Richard Evan Shultes, the man who took the man who took the psychchopic fungi in the '30 in Mext of the hallucinogeni in the '30 in Mexico.
I think my testhesis not to classessed these triptamine as a hallucinogens because if you're made not being hallucined. Risate.............................
It is possible to assume only if you have a few few people who denaturate the MAO.
Now is the beauty beta-carboline that are inbaby ines, the same kind of necessary as the same kind of necessary for the triptamines available to potentiate triptamines of 80,000 species, how these populations are they going to find two dead morphologistly don't million, but if you combine in this kind of a true that if you are dangerous version that is dangers?

But if we ask the Indians, they will tell us about the plants tell us about it."
What does it mean?
This tribbe, the Cofan, has 17 variety of ayahuase, which distinguished in the forest, and that our eyes would be in the same species.
If you ask how they are they ask, they tell us how they are going to tell us how much they were like, "Three of the rest I didn't know everyone wh?" I said, "No."
The solution is: you take 17 variety in a night of a bunch and each one will be a different different tune.
And you don't get to Harvard, but it's much more interesting than contare in Harvard, but it's much more interesting than content in this way.

All culture through the cents have been involved in a dance for new possibility of life.
And the problem is not technology.
Indians don't have been being Sioux when they put it from the arm and cock as and cock as Americans have no bed to be Americans when they put from the horse and calmites.
It's not the change or technology that threat the ethnosfer. It's the poterms. It's the poterm.

Thank you.
And I'm going to talk about some things that I hope to say that I hope to call the other that you have heard and prove to be a few links in case not for them.
I want to start with what I call "the official."
The dogal official of thing?
The official dogal society of all the Western industrial societial societies: "If we want to massive our city.
The reason is that freedom is in the fact that freedom is in itself a value, useful value, essential for human beings.
And in the other is that if we are free, each of us can act for it to do everything that massive in order to do everything that massive our benefit in name.
The way to massive freedom is massive choice.
More choice people are freedom, and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more choices is their freedom, and more and more and more choices are freedom, and more and more and more of the freedom is freedom, and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and
This is so deeply rooted in the society that nobody would have dreamed to put it in a doubt.
And it's also deeply row in our lives.
And I'm going to show you some examples of what progress has recovered possible.
This is my supermarket. It's not particularly big.
I lost a simple note on condition to initiate
In my supermarket there are 175 conditions, without content to the 10 variety of the extrack of the extracets, which you can buy a huge number of conditional conditions, which is a huge amount of condition that nobody of the 175 already ready to be your gradiment.
So that's the supermarket.
Then you go to the snegot, to buy a stereo: casses, reader CD, radio, radio, radio, radio, plast, the practice.
And in this single story, the nice of electronic components.
We can make six million different combinations using the components that there are in a only negotial in a negotia.
You need to admit that there is a lot of choice.
Other be: the world of communications.
One time, when I was a kid, they could get all the telephone services, to be pat that were forced by mamma Bell.
It was nowed the phone is not the bought it.
One consequence of that, in the way, it was that the telephone is that the telephone is not a make.
These themselves are gone.
We have a variety of telephone of the telephone cell phone of the phone cell phone of the cell phone of the phone cell phone of the phone cell phone of the phone cell phone of the cell phone cell phone of the phone cell phone of the cell phone cell phone of the cell phone cell phone of the phone cell phone cell phone c
So the cell phones of the future.
My favorite is that in a meth, reader MP3, cut the hidden of the nose and foreign for the crash of me --
If you don't have seen it in the store, you know, you're under the below house, you're going to be going to get there.
And what the ended is that people enter in the soul and it makes this question. And you know what the answer is, "No."
It doesn't possible to buy a cell phone that doesn't do too many things.
So, in other aspects of life that are much more important than the water's explosion of choices.
Assistence -- not happens in the United States you go from the doctor and the doctor of the doctor of the doctor and the doctor of the dramated.
Instead, you go from the doctor, and the doctor says, "Okay, you could do A, you know, "B" has these benefits and these sets and these risks. What do you want to do you that?"
You know, "Dr. Dot, what should I do?
And the doctor says, "A has these benefits and these risks and the Brits has these benefits and these risk."
"What do you want to do that?"
And you rebate said, "Dottore if she was me, what do you do?
And the doctor, "But I'm not lei."
The result of the malato," expression that makes it a beautiful thing.
But in fact, it's not a smom and responsibility to take the decisions of the decisions from someone who knows something, which is the doctor, and almost certainly it's sick -- and so it doesn't know -- and so in the condition to take the patient of the patient of the patient of the patient of the decisions of the decisions of the decisions from someone who knows the decisions of the decisions from anything,
There's a huge marketing of products of drug products to people like me and you, if you think that if you think it doesn't have any sense, that we can't buy them.
But if we can't buy them them because of the public them, because they are it?
The answer is that they want to do that doctor to ask the way to ask for the way to change the received to change the received to change the received to change the received to change the received to change the received to change the reject.
And that is that fundamental as is our identity is a question of choice, as you see in this vignant journey to be children. We don't want to force the children.
And we can reinvention us how many times we get to reinvent.
Whatever ever I was in the risk of the risk you to decide that kind of person wants to be.
It turns out to the family and matrimonize, a time the perspective, unhappy almost for anybody anything, and it was that he was the most prestant, and it was going to be able to be able to do it.
The only real choice was with chemicals with chemicals, not what to do later.
On the day, all is really really to play it.
I mean, in the student very smart, and I do their 20 percent in less than a time.
And because they don't have to be less diligents.
But why are they implemented to ask you to say, "Do I should I be able or no?
"Do I have to think before I think before you think before the kids or to the care?"
They're interrogative interrogats.
And they try to answer these questions, even if this implement, even if this implementing doesn't really get a bel vote to my exame.
And they really need to do that. I'm really important question.
Now, the work: we're lucky, like Carl suboline -- because the technology allows us to work every single day, from every day, from every day, from the model of the planet's planet, except from Hotel Randolph.
Turderderders, there's a corner, and he didn't tell any qual, where the WiFi works.
I don't say it because I want to use it.
What is that incredible freedom of choice that we have about the work? Is it it continuously decided, if we have to work in every moment, if we have to work or not.
We can go to the toy play, with the cell phone in a tax tax, Blackberry in the other, and the night night in the knee.
And even if they're all spective, every minute that we see our roll road the game we are also asking the game of the game we are also asking this call?"
"Do I have to answer this email? I got to embozing this liter?"
And even when the answer is "no," this makes the experience of the tites of your game from the game that would be be in other conditions.
So, we all look at it, little big, things and stilts and stilks and stilks of life, life is a question of choices.
Once the world was this: Ovo, there were some possibilities, but it wasn't a question of choice.
The world today is like this: The dilemma ism is a positive thing, or negative, or negative, or negative, or negative, or negative, or negative, or say?"
The answer is the answer is the same thing.
The positives we know all of them, so I'm going to talk about the negative of the negative lies.
All this is this choice behaviors on the two negative effects on people.
The first paradoxy, is that producing is that they are related to be free.
With many options between the way that you choose to do it.
I offer a meaning for meaningful instance, a conduction of flict pensionate pensionate pleasure.
A link my connection to the data of Vancer, the giant company with a million-degrees with about a million-million clients employees in 2,000 companies.
What she found is that for every 10 solutions that are coming out more, the percentage of adession of adession of adedession of the 2.
With 50 sources are about 10 percent of adesions at least adesions when they're available to be only 5. Why?
Because with 50 founds the way that you choose to decide and choice is to decide and choice is remaintains.
And I still ask question, and I said, "Yeah, I would say, "Yeah, I really won't get it.
You know, that doesn't mean that only means that these work from old who will be eating for the canod, because they will not have enough money, it wants to say that the decision is so obstant that the decision is so obsticle funds of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work in the old.
They don't participating them until 5,000 dollars for the dator 5000-dollar dator of the dator of the dator of the dator of it.
So the paralysis is a consequence of having too much choices.
And I think that makes the world like this.
"And finally finally for the ethchetches, senape or or maining or main?"
You would just take the right decision to the right decision if it's for the etherness, right?
You don't want to choose the wrong of the wrong condition to the wrong condition to it.
So this is the first effect. The second is that if we can avoid paralysis and do a choice, we finally have been less sodynamed by the result of how we were with less options between which you choose to avoid the paraly;
And this for different reasons.
One of these is that with many conditions that you choose to the choose, if you buy a little bit of a different choice that you would have a different choice that would be better choice that would be better better than the alternative imagined us to be a very high image of the choice, and rempiant the site the site the sflower of the decision of the decision that decision of the decision that you would have been doing a little bit of the present of the present of the defetch of the degree of the defetate of the church of the choice of the decision of the deci
even when it was a good decision.
More choice us is easy to be diseasy to any detail of any detail, which is insodly indicating of the option of choice.
And so, there's what economists call it cost economists call it cost-opportunity.
Dan Gilbert surprised very well stamattine as the value that we give the things depends on what we confronti.
And then I think when there are many options possible is to represent the features of the alternative features of the alternative and being less soddisappeared by the option of the option that is choice.
So here's an example. I scuse with all of the ones that are not in New York.
But it's probably what you probably think about it.
There's this copying to Hamptons.
A place of lused.
It splendid. It's all about them. It's all about them.
Not managent anything. But what is it is: "Well, maledization, is Agstod."
"All my neighbors in Manhattan are lived by here."
"I could talk about the right right in front of hous."
And two weeks that folded by the idea that is lost -- every day -- the chance of parking where you want.
The deliver, the delights the soddisfation for what we have, when the choice was excellent --
And more are the options that we have from considering the most characteristics return us to return us out out of how consto-opportunity.
Here's another example.
This journey says many things.
It talks about the time and maybe the living slow.
But the most important point is that you choice, you can take it to not do the others.
The things that don't choose have a lot of attractive that can make less attactive what we do.
Third point: spiral growing for the expectancy.
I tried to my skin, buying a new new jeans.
I was almost always jeeans.
Once the jeans were just a few people who were sought and vested by the best, they were smoodissimilar to a lot of times, starting to go well.
So, I went to buy a new time when the old people who were gone in the old people who were gone in jeeans, this is my tage."
The committed me to the slim fit, falling, relaxed it, fit?"
Do you want to the cernier or with the bottonies? "Stonehed" or "acid" or "acid" or "that?
"Do you want to be the road?"
"Well it wants to be a stret? Ble -- the bla-up to the bla-hold and it it was in the bit.
I was skid, and after a little bit of I could say, "I want to want to the kind of -- which was the only guy who was so for a hour jeeans, and I tried to all the 'sti in the negoties, and then I went from the negoti, and I had ever ever happened.
And it was the massive. I had the check of that choice I had the better.
But I felt t the worse.
Why? I wrote a book to understand it.
The reason I was worse is that I was that with all that choice my expected, jeans had to be perfectly perfectly fold.
And I was expected to minim. I didn't expect to me nothing about exceptional, when it was just a guessed by a guy, at least a guy had to be perfect.
What I had watched was good, but not perfect that.
After I paragoned to what I was trying to be insodded in confront.
The addition of the options of the people don't make the expect that these have respect the same brought in the options itself.
And this will be less soddisfation, even when the results are good ones.
No one in the world of marketing if it makes it content.
Because if you know it doesn't know what I'm talking about.
The truth resembles more than that.
"It was better when it was worse when it was worse when it was worried when it was worse was worried above it was still possible to meet the surprise pleasure.
On the world that we live -- opulal initiitizens with the citizens the falling of the perfeation -- the massive that we can hope is that things are at the waiting of expectancy.
You never have the premise pleasant because your expectances, my expectances, and I have ingiant to you.
The secret of happiness -- what you're here -- is "Basas." "Yes, you want to say, "Yes, you want."
I mean, little -- I mean, little time I mean, I'm really sposed and my wife is really stupendous.
I couldn't do it better, I didn't have to do it in it.
But it doesn't always get a good thing.
And finally, a consequence of the buying a couple of jeans smoods when you have that kind of jeans is that when you're not satisd, and you ask you "What?"
"What's responsibl?" "What, the answer is clear.
The world is the responsible. What could I do?
When there are hundreds of jeeans, and you buy a insoddisrently and you ask you to you, you who is responsible for you to be you.
You could have to do a better.
With hundreds of variety variety in available for the insuccess.
So when people get to get decisions, even if the result is valid, they feel insodynamed and damage their same.
In the last few years the depression is exploded in the industrialized world.
I think a meaning -- I don't think that the universe -- this hondid, but important -- of this wave of this wave is very much too much of the people have deludent experience.
And when they need to explain this situation that the color is them.
So the final result is that in general we're very very much better, but we feel worse.
Let me tell you about it.
This is the official dogal dogal and it's completely failed.
