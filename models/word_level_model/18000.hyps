<unk> year I showed these <unk> <unk> <unk>, which for almost three million years had the size of the United States <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, which for almost three million years had the size of the United States <unk>,
<unk> this <unk> the <unk> of the problem because it doesn't show the ice <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> is, in a way, the heart of the <unk> of the global system.
It's <unk> <unk> and <unk>.
The next <unk> will be a <unk> <unk> on the last 25 years.
<unk> <unk> are <unk> in red.
You see, you see, they <unk> up to the blue <unk>.
That's the ice in <unk>, which <unk> in summer.
You can see that the <unk> ice <unk>, five years, it's like the blood, which here <unk> from the body.
In 25 years, it's been <unk>, so.
This is a problem because the <unk> <unk> <unk> the ground around the ocean where there are huge amount of <unk> <unk> that, <unk> are <unk> <unk> <unk> that, <unk> are <unk> in <unk> by the <unk>.
<unk> to the <unk> <unk> <unk>, that <unk> could <unk>, that <unk> could <unk>, <unk> this point of not <unk>.
In some <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is already <unk> from the water.
The <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>! <unk>: She's good. <unk>: She's good. The question is if we also do it.
A reason is that this <unk> <unk> <unk> from the north.
This is a river in <unk> <unk>.
<unk> had never <unk> <unk> similar.
This is the <unk> <unk>, in the <unk> <unk>.
If you want to know how the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on <unk>, here is where the sea.
These <unk> are <unk>.
<unk> else else else's <unk>, the largest <unk> of ice <unk>.
<unk> month, scientists have <unk> that the <unk> of the ice <unk> is in <unk>, and that <unk> <unk> on some <unk> <unk>, is particularly <unk> in the <unk>.
<unk> at <unk> feet of the level of the <unk>, like <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, the third largest <unk> of ice, you see new <unk>, which a few years ago.
<unk> percent of the world population will be half of the water from that <unk>.
<unk> <unk>: this <unk> is the source of the water <unk> of this city.
<unk> is <unk>.
But when you <unk>, the same happens to the water.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> are in the crisis.
<unk>, as you read, they're <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> in the world, <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> are <unk> to a <unk> out of the normal <unk> and without <unk>.
Sometimes, over the last 30 years, <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This is a <unk> of the whole <unk>.
If you look at it in the context of the <unk> can see the <unk>.
We've been <unk> 70 million <unk> of CO2 <unk> every 24 hours -- 25 million <unk> in the ocean every day.
Look at the area of the <unk> <unk>, from <unk>, to <unk>, and on both parts of the <unk> <unk>, where there's a <unk> <unk> of oxygen in the oceans.
The most <unk> of global warming, with <unk>, which is the use of <unk> <unk>.
The oil is a problem, and <unk> is even worse.
The United States is one of the two countries with <unk> emissions, together to China.
And they <unk> to build a lot of other <unk> <unk>.
But we're <unk> to a <unk> of the direction.
These are the projects <unk> over the last years and some <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
So, there's a <unk> policy in our country.
<unk> <unk> and oil <unk> <unk> million dollars in the last year to <unk> <unk> <unk>, which is a <unk>.
<unk> image I'm <unk> something --
<unk> <unk>, in <unk>, where I live, there was a <unk> of <unk> billion <unk> <unk> of <unk>.
Maybe you saw it on the <unk>.
This is the second largest flow in America.
It's happened around <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> of one of the <unk> <unk> was this.
<unk>: <unk> â™« <unk> <unk> is a <unk> <unk> and happy.
It's <unk> here in America, and <unk> our economy.
<unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk>.
It's <unk>, <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> is from here's most of the <unk> <unk>.
The largest <unk> society on the <unk> is <unk> <unk>. This is his <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> <unk>: <unk> <unk> -- Al <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> -- they don't know what they're talking about.
<unk>: So <unk> for the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> has <unk> two <unk>.
This is one of them, one part.
<unk>: <unk>: <unk> we see the changes as a <unk> <unk> to our business.
So, our <unk> is <unk> a big amount of money in a <unk> <unk> to make public <unk> and <unk> the truth.
Actually, <unk> is not <unk>.
We think it's <unk> -- it's also a good <unk>.
So, we don't know about climate change.
We should do it.
<unk>: <unk> <unk>: <unk> <unk> -- you've heard a lot of it.
So, I'm going to <unk> a <unk> <unk> for how much <unk>.
<unk>! <unk> are a little <unk>, but that's the sound of the technology of <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> is between the main <unk> of global <unk>, but the <unk> technology technology of <unk> that you see changes everything.
Let's look at this is the <unk> technology of <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to the economic issue and national security.
<unk>: <unk>: <unk> America is in the crisis; the economy, national <unk>.
The <unk> that the <unk> all: our <unk> from the <unk> <unk>, like <unk> and the oil <unk>.
Now, there's a new, <unk> solution to <unk>.
<unk> America: 100 percent of <unk> energy in 10 years.
A <unk> plan to <unk> America to work, <unk> <unk>, and to help <unk> global warming.
<unk>, a solution that we tend to solve our problems.
<unk> America. <unk> more.
<unk>: This is the last one.
<unk>: <unk>: It's <unk> energy to America.
One of the most <unk> ways of <unk> <unk> to the <unk> that <unk> our planet.
<unk>: The future is here. <unk>, the sun, a new network.
<unk> <unk> 2: <unk> <unk> for jobs <unk> <unk>
<unk>: <unk> America. It's time to be <unk>.
<unk>: A old <unk> <unk> says, "If you want to go, you go from alone.
If you want to go far, you go together. "
We have to go far, fast.
Thank you very much.
<unk> year at TED I did a <unk> on <unk>.
And I'm going to try to <unk> about how the machine works.
So, here. And for those who was not the other time there were no, the <unk> is the largest scientific experiment ever <unk> -- <unk> miles of <unk>.
His job is to <unk> the conditions that were in the less than a <unk> <unk> from the beginning of the universe -- to <unk> million times a second.
All that's just <unk>.
This is the <unk> <unk>.
And so these <unk> <unk> in the <unk>.
This is what I work on. It's called <unk> -- <unk> feet and it's <unk> feet and it's <unk> feet.
This is a <unk> <unk> image in building so you can see the <unk>.
<unk> <unk> last year, we <unk> the car for the first time.
And this picture was <unk> by <unk>.
It was <unk> <unk> in control.
It's an image of the first <unk> of particles that he had all the around the <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, with a part of the <unk>, and <unk> particles inside the <unk>.
In other words, when you look at that picture the 10 <unk>, <unk> that the machine, which is a big <unk>.
I don't know if that was to <unk> us more or this, when somebody <unk> on Google and I <unk> that the <unk> page was this.
That means we've had a <unk> impact beyond the scientific <unk>.
And I was a week later, there was a problem with the car, I had to do this <unk> here -- these <unk> <unk>.
These <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> when the car works at the <unk> of the <unk>.
Now, the <unk> between you are <unk> <unk> and <unk>, "It's not true. I'm <unk> too <unk>."
And instead they can do it because when they're very <unk> to become the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
So, <unk> degrees <unk>, at a <unk> temperature <unk> to the space of the stars, these <unk> can bring that <unk>.
In one of the <unk> of the most <unk> <unk> in the <unk>, there was a <unk> <unk>.
So the <unk> <unk> <unk>, and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a electric <unk>.
This was the result.
Now, this is even more <unk> if you think that these <unk> <unk> <unk> over 20 <unk>, and that's <unk> about 30 <unk>.
They <unk> about 50 <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, what we did.
We <unk> them and <unk>.
Now they're all <unk> to their <unk> place.
<unk> the end of <unk> <unk> will be new <unk>.
<unk>, and we try to get it to get some data to <unk> or <unk>, and continue to <unk> what are the <unk> that <unk> the universe.
Now, of course, in a way, these <unk> <unk> the <unk> of science and engineering <unk>.
I think the fact that's so difficult, the fact that's so difficult, I think that's the value of things like <unk>.
<unk>, I'd like to end with the words of a <unk> <unk>, who, <unk> <unk> <unk>, who, in <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, his <unk> was Michael <unk>, he said, "No, so <unk> as the <unk> that the ideas of science are <unk>, that there are no <unk> in nature, that our <unk> are <unk>, and that there are no new <unk> <unk>."
Thank you.
I want to start <unk> <unk> to when, from children, <unk> with <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, actually, to think and solve <unk> problems.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to the way we <unk> most of the world around us.
So, from <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of our <unk> with <unk> objects, together to my <unk> <unk>, and my <unk> <unk> <unk>, I started <unk>, "And if we use a computer, instead of having the only <unk> as the <unk> that's <unk> on a <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with both hands,
and <unk> to our <unk>?
The question was so interesting that I thought I was trying to explore the answer, building <unk>.
In a few words, a <unk> is a <unk> computer <unk> as a <unk>.
In a few words, a <unk> is a <unk> computer <unk> as a <unk>.
You can <unk> them with their hand, they can say, "<unk>" them "and have a screen <unk>.
But <unk>, they're <unk> objects, like <unk>, you can just <unk>.
<unk> are the example of a new <unk> to <unk> the digital information.
And as <unk> as <unk>, as <unk>, as <unk>, other, of the movement, others, and as they become <unk>, of their movement, others, how we can explore new and <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> with some simple example.
This <unk> is <unk> to show you about the video: if you put it in a direction, the <unk> <unk>, so if you can put it in the other side, then you'll go back.
These <unk> <unk> are <unk> of others.
If you <unk> them, they <unk> what they're going to be around.
If they get <unk>, you can <unk> it and they can <unk> a little bit.
If they get <unk>, you can <unk> it and they can <unk> a little bit.
They also <unk> their movement and <unk>.
We then realized that one of the interesting <unk> <unk> was that we could use common <unk> on data, for example, "<unk>" a color as if it was a <unk>.
In this case, we have three <unk> <unk> as a <unk> <unk> and I can <unk> to <unk> the color in that central, where you're <unk>.
and I can <unk> to <unk> the color in the central one, where they <unk>.
If we <unk> too much, we can <unk> a little bit.
And there are also <unk> <unk> <unk>, like <unk>, <unk> and games where people can <unk> to try and <unk> where people can <unk> things quickly, and <unk> the results immediately.
Now, I'm --
This is a sequence of <unk> that I do with a <unk> program.
Here we have a word word that's <unk> between <unk> and <unk>.
<unk>, every <unk> <unk> <unk> a letter to <unk> on every <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, every <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk> a letter to <unk>, and as I was <unk> to <unk> <unk>.
Then, after about 30 seconds, you <unk>, and you have a new <unk> of <unk> and new <unk> <unk>.
Thank you.
Here's the kids who are <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk>, I did so that I <unk> them and I <unk> a video.
They are <unk> very <unk>.
And one of the interesting things about this <unk> of <unk> is that you don't have to give people a lot of <unk>.
I just say, "<unk> <unk>", "and they know what to do.
Here's the people who <unk> it.
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>,
It actually wanted to <unk>.
They were just <unk>, for him.
Now, this is a <unk> <unk> of a <unk> <unk>.
We could build a <unk> for the <unk> of the <unk>. He's <unk>.
It can <unk> new characters in the scene, <unk> their <unk>.
It can <unk> new characters in the scene, <unk> their <unk>.
So, that's doing the sun.
<unk>: The sun is <unk>.
David <unk>: Now he's <unk> a <unk> in the scene.
<unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> work! Yeah!
So, <unk> the <unk> and <unk> can <unk> the characters --
<unk>: <unk>!
<unk> your story.
<unk>: <unk>!
<unk>: It's a story with the open open, and it can decide how to <unk>.
<unk>: It's a story with the open open, and it can decide how to <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>, <unk>.
<unk>: The last example I have the time to show you is a <unk>, which was <unk>, in <unk> and <unk> music.
It's a <unk>, which was recently <unk>, to <unk> and <unk> music.
The <unk> here are <unk> <unk> as <unk>, <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> of these four different <unk>, and you can choose which I use.
And you can also <unk> these <unk> in a sequence that's <unk>.
And I just <unk> by doing a <unk> sound and a sequence.
These are actually that you can control the alive, like <unk> and <unk>.
I'm going to <unk> it to a particular sound and then <unk> to <unk> it.
And then there are actually <unk>, like time, and <unk>, which is <unk> to the entire sequence.
<unk> how it works.
<unk>: <unk>: <unk> <unk> a <unk> in two <unk> sequence, "<unk> in a series, <unk>, <unk> in a series, the <unk>, <unk>.
Now let's take a <unk> line.
<unk>: <unk>: Now let's <unk> <unk>...
<unk>: <unk>: And now I'm going to <unk> the <unk>, so I can control the effect from live.
<unk>: <unk>: I can <unk> the entire sequence <unk> the time on one hand.
<unk>: <unk>: And now <unk> <unk> the bottom to give <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>: I can <unk> the sequence of the flight.
So I don't have to <unk> before, but I can <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk>.
And now, finally, I can <unk> the entire sequence <unk> on the left <unk> the <unk> <unk>.
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is to build new <unk> <unk> <unk>, how our brain works.
And today, I've <unk> to show you one of the results of this <unk>, and some possibilities that we try to get out of the lab.
The concept that I want to <unk> is that it's <unk> this new generation of <unk> objects to <unk> with the media, which <unk> information in our world in the way we want.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the <unk> to talk to all of you.
I'm a <unk>.
<unk> books is my <unk>, but it's more of course,
It's also the love and the <unk> of my life.
And I don't look like that.
But, I said this, something particular is happened in my life and in my career, which has taken me to <unk> the whole relationship with this job.
The particular thing is I wrote this book, this <unk> called "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, which, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, for some reason to <unk> the world and <unk> a big, <unk> <unk>.
And the result of it is that everywhere I'm going to <unk>, people <unk> me as if I <unk>.
<unk> -- <unk>, <unk>!
I'm going to go from me now, and they say, "You don't have fear of you not be able to do it better?
You don't have fear to write for all the life without being able to create a book that can <unk> to make a book that can <unk> to someone? "
that can <unk>? "
It's <unk>, you know.
But it could go worse, part of that I remember over 20 years ago, when I was telling people -- I was a <unk> -- I wanted to be a <unk>.
I'm <unk> at the same <unk> <unk>.
And people said, "Don't <unk> I'm not going to be able to be able to be <unk>?
You don't get <unk>?
You don't have fear to do this <unk> for all of life without anything coming out and die on a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>? "
So, you know.
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is, "Yes."
Yeah, I'm <unk> of all those things.
I've always been <unk>.
And I'm also <unk> of many other things that people can't <unk>.
How <unk> and other things <unk>.
But, as much as I did, I know, I thought, and <unk> <unk> is why?
Is it <unk>?
It's <unk> that anybody who <unk> <unk> to be <unk> by a job that you feel in order to do.
But what's so particular, in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> about health <unk> <unk> <unk> in a way that other <unk> do not do?
How did my father, for example, he was a <unk> <unk> and I didn't remember one time in his <unk> years of activity where asked if they were were to be <unk> <unk>?
There was never -- that <unk> of the <unk> John, how does it go?
Don't <unk>, how do you get it?
<unk>, the engineers like no group of course, the <unk> of being <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We <unk>, we have enough this <unk>, and not just <unk> but <unk> of all of these kinds, we have this <unk> to be <unk> <unk>.
And I don't know, look at the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that, just in the <unk> century, young and often for them.
And the ones that are not <unk> seem to be really <unk> by their <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, before they were <unk> in the last <unk> said, "My book has <unk> me a little bit more <unk>." And I was a little bit more <unk>. "And I was <unk> <unk> about their life.
But we don't know when we <unk> to say why we've been so long that way that we have all these things so far, we have completely <unk> and <unk> are <unk> in some way, and that art, at the end, <unk>.
And the question I want to <unk> all here is, you know, you know, that's this idea?
It's good for this thing -- because it's also <unk> by a <unk> distance to me, it's not good for this <unk>.
I think it's <unk>.
And I think it's also <unk> and I don't want to <unk> <unk> in the next century.
I think it's better <unk> our big <unk> to live.
And I certainly know that, in my case -- it's really <unk> to start <unk> to <unk> <unk> to that <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in which I'm in my career.
<unk> -- <unk> look at this, I'm pretty young, I've got 40 years.
I still have about four <unk> of work in me.
And it's very <unk> that anything <unk> <unk> in now, then it's going to be <unk> from the world as the work that I would <unk> <unk> after the last book of my last book.
<unk> <unk>, because we're all <unk> or less friends here -- is <unk> that my biggest success is to my <unk>.
Oh, <unk>, what thinking!
You know this is the kind of thinking that leads to a person to start <unk> <unk> at nine <unk> in the morning and I don't want to do it.
I'm going to keep doing this work that I love.
So, the question is, how?
And so, I think, after many <unk>, that the way to work to write is to create a <unk> <unk> <unk>, OK?
I have to have to get a distance of security between me, which I'm <unk>, and the natural <unk> that I wrote about, and the natural <unk> that I wrote about it, and as I'm <unk> for all last year, looking at the time, looking at trying to find out if you have the best ideas and more <unk>.
about how to help people <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity.
And that research has taken me to the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
It's because I <unk> in <unk> and then <unk> back.
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> -- people don't believe believe that creativity <unk> creativity from men, OK?
It was <unk> that creativity was this <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> to men from some <unk> <unk> and <unk>, for reasons <unk> and <unk>, for reasons <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> these <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of creativity.
<unk>, <unk>, I decided to have a <unk> that <unk> <unk> from far.
<unk> were the same idea, but I'm going to <unk> that sort of spirit without a <unk>.
which is <unk>, because the <unk> didn't really know that a <unk> was somebody was particularly somebody who was <unk>.
<unk> that <unk> was this sort of <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> literally <unk> in the <unk> of the study of a artist, a little bit like <unk> <unk>, and that <unk> out of <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the <unk>, and <unk> the result of the <unk> of the artist, and <unk> the result of that work.
<unk> <unk> <unk> that I'm <unk> -- that <unk> <unk> that <unk> you from the results of your work.
And everybody <unk> that was so that I was <unk>, right?
So, artists <unk> were <unk> by <unk>, like, for example, how much <unk>, right?
If your work was <unk>, you didn't <unk> all the <unk>, everybody <unk> that was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
If your work <unk>, it wasn't all <unk>, right?
Everybody <unk> that was your <unk> to be a <unk>.
And so people <unk> <unk> creativity in <unk> for a long time.
And then the <unk> <unk> and everything <unk>, and we <unk> this big idea; we put the human being at the center of the universe over the center of the universe over the <unk>.
This was the principle of <unk> <unk> and people tend to think that creativity is <unk> by <unk>.
And for the first time in history, they <unk> to <unk> this or that artist as a rather <unk> person to a rather <unk> that's a person with <unk>.
And I have to say, I think that was a big <unk>.
I think you're going to be like a <unk> person to believe that I think of being as a source, as a source of all of the <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, <unk> and <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> is a <unk> <unk> to <unk>.
It's like to ask someone to <unk> the sun.
<unk> and <unk> completely <unk> the <unk> and creates all these <unk> <unk> on the <unk>.
And I think it was this pressure to <unk> artists in the <unk> 500 years.
And, if that's true, and I think that's the question, is it becomes, and now?
Can we do it?
<unk> to go back to a <unk> <unk> of human relationship and <unk> <unk>.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we can't <unk> 500 years of thinking about <unk> <unk> in a 18 minutes.
And there's probably people in the audience who <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk>, you do <unk> people <unk> <unk> <unk> on their projects.
You probably don't all of this thing.
But the question I'd like to <unk> is -- why not?
Why don't we <unk> this way?
Because it's more <unk> than anything that ever heard to explain the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> process.
A process that, as anyone who has ever <unk> to do something -- so, basically, all of them here -- knows, you know, you don't <unk>.
And in fact, it can sometimes look completely <unk>.
I did this <unk> <unk> with the extraordinary <unk> <unk>, who has now 90 years old, but which was a <unk> for life and said, during his <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> out in the <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> out in the <unk> <unk>, <unk> out in the <unk> <unk>, <unk> out in the fields, and he <unk> it, in if you, when a <unk> the <unk> from the <unk>.
He said, it was like a <unk> <unk>.
And that <unk> <unk> to her from the <unk>.
I was <unk>, because he was <unk> the earth under his feet.
I thought I had one thing to do to do that point and was, he said, "<unk> as a <unk>."
And so he went to home and he was <unk> by this <unk>, and it would not have to get else that I had a piece of paper, and a pretty quickly <unk>, and <unk> on the page.
Sometimes I didn't <unk> enough, so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> without being able to get it to the <unk> and she would <unk> the <unk> through the <unk>, to say, "another <unk>."
And then there were those times -- this piece never <unk> -- there was no <unk> times, when the <unk> was almost <unk>, right?
So, he was <unk> home and he was looking for paper and the <unk> through the <unk> through, and he <unk> a <unk> right in the while he was <unk> with the other hand and <unk> it.
<unk> the <unk> from the tail and the <unk> in his body and the <unk> on the page.
And in these cases, the <unk> would be <unk> on the <unk> page and <unk>, but <unk>, the <unk> word to the first word to the word.
So when I <unk> <unk> -- it's <unk>, it's exactly <unk> to my <unk> process.
Not all my <unk> process -- I'm not a <unk>!
I'm a <unk>, and my way of <unk> is; I'm going to <unk> every day and work and <unk> on top.
But even I was in my <unk>, I <unk> against that thing, sometimes.
And I'm also <unk> many of you <unk> the fact.
You know, even if the work and ideas <unk> me <unk> from a certain source I couldn't have to <unk> <unk>.
And what is this thing?
And how can we <unk> it in a way that we don't lose your head, but rather, that's kind of face it?
So, as I'm the best example, I'm <unk> <unk> <unk>, which I've <unk> different years ago for a <unk>.
<unk> talking about this, and you know, <unk>, for the <unk> of life was the <unk> of the <unk> artist's <unk> <unk>, trying to control, <unk> these <unk> <unk> <unk>.
But then <unk>, he was <unk>, and one day while he was <unk> on a <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> everything for him.
<unk> <unk>, and everything of a <unk> <unk> this little <unk> of <unk>, which is in his head as a <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, and you want, and the <unk>, and the <unk>, but it doesn't know how to <unk>.
It's not a <unk> piece of paper, it doesn't have a <unk>.
So it starts to hear this kind of old <unk> <unk> <unk> in him, "I'm going to lose, and I'm going to <unk> from this <unk> song.
I'm not <unk> enough and I can't <unk> it. "
And instead of going to go to the <unk>, they <unk>.
He <unk> the whole process and made something completely new.
He just <unk> the sky and said, "<unk>, you don't see that I'm <unk>?"
"Do you think it can write a song now?
If you really want to <unk>, you'll <unk> it in a <unk> moment when I can <unk> care of you.
<unk>, <unk> to <unk> another today.
<unk> <unk> <unk>. "
And his process <unk> <unk> after this.
Not the work, the work was still <unk> like always.
But the process, and the <unk> <unk> that <unk> was <unk> when he <unk> the <unk>, the <unk> that the <unk> that the problems and <unk> it back from <unk> where, <unk> was <unk> that it wasn't to be a <unk> thing and <unk>.
but I <unk> this <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> a conversation between <unk> and this thing <unk> and <unk> <unk> that <unk>, but it wasn't <unk>.
So how much <unk> that story to change a little bit of a way I'm <unk> and already <unk> me once and I <unk> me once.
This idea, I <unk> when I was <unk> "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and I <unk> in one of those <unk> <unk> when we're all working on something and you can't think that's going to be a <unk>, which will be the <unk>, that will be the <unk>, that will be the book.
Not just <unk>, just <unk> the book wrote.
And I started thinking about <unk> this project.
But then I'm <unk> to <unk> that <unk> <unk> and <unk> us.
So I <unk> my face on the <unk> and I <unk> my <unk> to a <unk> <unk> of the room.
And I said to <unk>, "<unk>, what, we know, if this book is not going to be <unk>, not be <unk>, my <unk>, not?
Because as you see, I'm <unk> everything I have, I don't have this.
So if you want it to be better, you have to <unk> and do your part.
Okay. But if you don't do that, you know what, you don't know anything.
I started to write the same because it's my job.
And I would like to say, please, I'm <unk> to do my part of "Because that's the end of the Africa is so, OK -- <unk> does it in the <unk> Africa <unk> people <unk> to <unk> the <unk> <unk>, and music <unk> that <unk>, and <unk> music that <unk>, and <unk> and hours to <unk>.
And they were always <unk>, because the <unk> were <unk> and <unk>.
But every so, <unk>, something <unk>, and one of these <unk> artists actually <unk>.
And I know what I'm talking about what I'm, because I know that you all of them, at some point, a <unk> like this.
It was like the time <unk>, and the <unk> <unk> through a kind of <unk> and it was <unk> through a kind of <unk> and it was <unk>.
And suddenly, I don't just know, like a human.
But they <unk> from <unk> and <unk> under the <unk> of the <unk>.
And when this <unk>, at the time, people <unk> what was, he <unk> him.
<unk> your hands and <unk> <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, God,"
That's God, you know.
<unk> <unk> note -- when the <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the <unk>, I <unk> this <unk> with them and <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> from "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, which you can still feel in <unk> or <unk>.
In <unk>, when a artist has done something impossible and <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>,
And it's <unk> because we need.
But the problem is coming up the day after the <unk>, when you <unk> and <unk> <unk> that are the 11 <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> it.
It's just a <unk> <unk> with great <unk> to <unk>, and maybe you never <unk> to <unk> that <unk>.
And maybe nobody <unk> the name of God still, and what does it have to do with the rest of his life?
It's hard.
This is one of the most <unk> <unk> to do in a <unk> life.
But maybe it doesn't have to be so <unk> if you can't believe, you know, that the most <unk> of your being being <unk> by you.
But I just <unk> you have data in <unk> from a source of this <unk> <unk> of your life that you have to <unk> <unk> when you're finished.
And, you know, if we think that way it's all changes.
And so I started <unk>, and it's <unk> like I <unk> for several months during the <unk> <unk> of the book that I was soon <unk>, the <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> of my success.
And what I have to keep <unk> when I feel like to <unk> from this is, I'm not <unk>.
Don't <unk>. <unk> just your job.
<unk> <unk> for your part, any can be.
If your work is <unk>, <unk>.
If the <unk>, you'll <unk> <unk> <unk> to you <unk> <unk> <unk> some kind of <unk>, for one moment through your <unk>, then, "<unk>!"
<unk>, you do the same your <unk>.
And <unk>! "<unk>!"
I think it's <unk>.
"<unk>!" <unk>! "<unk>, just for having a human love and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> by <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk>: <unk>!
As you know, I've talked about some of these projects on the human genome, what can <unk> and the discovery of new genes.
Now we're <unk> a new way: we started <unk> the biology and now from that digital code, we're <unk> into a new <unk> of biology, <unk> and <unk> life.
We always tried to <unk> big questions.
"What is life?" It's something that many <unk> I think they have <unk> to understand different levels.
We tried different <unk>, <unk> to the <unk>.
We're <unk> for about 20 years now.
When we <unk> the human genome <unk> to <unk> from the world of biology world.
Now, we're going to <unk> us: can we <unk> the life, or create new life from this digital universe?
This is the map of a small <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, which is the <unk> species from the <unk> genome between those that can <unk> into the lab.
And we tried to <unk> <unk> the genome to <unk> one even smaller.
We can <unk> a <unk> of the <unk> of about 500 that are here.
But when we look at its <unk> map, it's <unk> simple than our <unk>.
<unk>, that's simple.
But when you look at all the genes that we can <unk>, one at the time, it's very <unk> that this can bring a <unk> cell.
So I thought the only way to <unk> that <unk> was <unk> this <unk> so that we can <unk> the <unk> to <unk> some of these questions.
And so we started the <unk> of the "We can <unk> a <unk>?"
Can the chemistry <unk> of produce these big molecules that we've never been able to create before?
And in case, can we make a <unk>?
A <unk> is just a <unk> piece of <unk> material.
The speed with which we're able to <unk> life is <unk> to <unk> <unk>.
Our <unk> <unk> code, instead, <unk> rather slowly, but it's <unk>.
And our most <unk> <unk> <unk> on a <unk> <unk>.
We <unk> over 15 years ago.
The process has <unk> many <unk>, <unk> with a <unk> <unk> <unk> before <unk> <unk> that <unk> the first experiments.
But we found that DNA <unk> is very difficult.
There are <unk> of thousands of cars in the world that <unk> small <unk> of DNA <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, and it's a <unk> process: the <unk> is long, the <unk> is, the longer there are.
So we had to develop a new way to <unk> these <unk> and <unk> the <unk>.
And this was our first <unk>, <unk> from information of the digital genome of <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's a small virus that <unk> bacteria.
We designed the <unk>, <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> a DNA <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
The interesting part is when we took this piece of <unk> <unk> <unk> and we <unk> it into the bacteria, the bacteria have <unk> to read this code and <unk> particles.
<unk> particles are <unk> by cells, they <unk> back and they <unk> the <unk> <unk>.
I talked about <unk> in <unk> industry that they certainly <unk> this model.
They have more than you.
<unk> that's a situation where the software can actually build its same <unk> in a <unk> system.
But I could do the bigger things in the big.
We could build the entire <unk> of the <unk>.
They are more <unk> <unk> <unk>.
So we thought about <unk> in the size of the virus, so that we can change the <unk> to understand what the <unk> is the <unk> of a <unk> cell.
<unk> is <unk>, and if you <unk> information with information information in a computer, they have to be very <unk>.
When I was <unk> this genome for the first time in <unk> the <unk> <unk> was a <unk> for every 10 <unk> <unk>.
We found, <unk>, 30 <unk>. If we used that original sequence, you never have been able to do it.
One part of the process is designing <unk> 50 <unk> that <unk> with all the other <unk> <unk> of 50 <unk> to build smaller <unk> that <unk>.
<unk> elements here.
You probably read that <unk> us of the <unk>.
<unk> <unk>: We have a <unk> code on four <unk>: A, <unk>, <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> of those <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, about 20 <unk>, and there's a <unk> order to <unk> every <unk>.
So we can use the code for <unk> words, <unk>, <unk>.
What we did at the beginning was <unk>.
Some of them were <unk> by the fact that it wasn't <unk>.
We designed these <unk> to <unk> just <unk> with <unk>.
There are <unk> that <unk> them and <unk> them.
And we started <unk> <unk>, <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
But anyway, we have these <unk> in <unk> so that we're <unk> <unk>, because we're trying to create a <unk> <unk> that we're <unk> to create a minute.
We're trying to <unk> the process.
So, this seems to be the <unk> of a <unk> <unk>.
When you get to these very <unk>, much more than 100 <unk> <unk> <unk>, you don't get directly directly in the <unk> <unk>.
You get to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk>.
So we've <unk> other <unk>.
<unk> of another <unk> called <unk> <unk>, which in biology <unk> to <unk> DNA that <unk> to <unk> DNA to <unk> the DNA to <unk>.
Here's an example.
This <unk>, called <unk> <unk>, can <unk> three million <unk> <unk>.
You can see in the <unk> as his <unk> <unk> is <unk>.
And 12 -- 24 hours, it's <unk> exactly like it was before.
<unk> of thousands of organisms that are able to do that.
These organisms can be completely <unk>.
We could live under <unk>.
I'm absolutely sure that life <unk> in space, and you <unk> to find new <unk> <unk> of water.
Actually, NASA has shown that this happens.
This is an image of the <unk> that we've built using these <unk>, just using the <unk> with the design <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> <unk> them.
This image was not <unk> with a <unk> <unk>, but with a <unk> <unk>.
It's a <unk> so big that we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk>.
These are pictures that <unk> a period of about six seconds.
This is the <unk> that we've <unk> just <unk>.
They are more <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's the largest <unk> of a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's got a <unk> <unk>.
If you <unk> it with a <unk> 10 <unk>, <unk> <unk> pages to <unk> this code.
Now, how do we do it work? How can we <unk>?
<unk>, through a <unk> virus is a game from kids.
It's a little bit more <unk> when you use the bacteria.
It's <unk> simple when it's <unk> cells like our: you can just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> another, which is basically the process of <unk>.
In <unk>, we <unk> the <unk> is instead <unk> inside the cell, but we <unk> <unk> that we're able to do a <unk> <unk> <unk> of a <unk> cell to another and <unk>.
We <unk> a <unk> <unk> from a kind of a <unk>.
<unk> are different how men from <unk>.
We <unk> some <unk> <unk> in a way that we could decide which to <unk> what this <unk>.
And then he <unk> it <unk> with <unk> so that we can <unk> all the <unk>.
And when we put it in the cell was <unk> and <unk> our <unk> <unk> the new <unk> went into the cell.
And we <unk> <unk> that we didn't go beyond, but we tried to <unk> it over there.
This is one of the big <unk> of evolution.
We found that <unk> species have <unk> a second or a third <unk> somewhere, <unk> in a second thousands of new <unk> to that species.
So who thinks about evolution as a <unk> <unk> at the time that <unk> has not <unk> most of the biology.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that DNA <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> that was in the cell, you didn't know.
The <unk> <unk> we <unk> it.
It's <unk>, and it <unk> the other <unk> like <unk> material, and we <unk> it, and we <unk> with only the cell and the new <unk>.
It became blue because of the genes we <unk>.
And in a short short <unk> of time, all the <unk> of a kind of <unk>, and it's <unk> of all in a new species, <unk> on software that we <unk> in the cell.
All the <unk> are <unk>, the <unk> are <unk>, and when you look at the code, you know,
Now, this may seem <unk> <unk>, but we <unk> the software, we can change the software enough.
Now, I've already <unk> that there's not about <unk> -- but of progress from three million years and a half million years of evolution, and I said that maybe we're going to create a new version of the <unk> <unk> that we can <unk> new <unk> <unk> species on this digital process.
Why do that?
I think it's quite <unk> when we think of our <unk>.
We're going to be <unk> billion people in the next 40 years.
Right to give one example: I was born in <unk>.
There are now three people on the planet to <unk> <unk> in <unk>; in the <unk> years, there's four years.
We're <unk> problems now to find food, water and <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, <unk> and <unk> for six billion people.
We're going to have to do it for nine billion.
<unk> billion <unk> <unk>.
That means 100 million <unk> a day.
When we try to find <unk> <unk>, or any kind of process to <unk>, it will be a huge challenge.
<unk> we have to realize all the <unk> of CO2 from these materials that <unk> in the atmosphere.
At day, with the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> around the world, we have a <unk> with about 20 million genes, and I like to think that are the <unk> <unk> for the future.
The <unk> industry <unk> only a <unk> <unk>, and think about how many different things are <unk> out.
Our <unk> are <unk> data from the reality reality of the <unk> and our imagination.
Now we have <unk>, because of these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, able to create what we call <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We can actually build a big robot that can produce a big <unk> that can produce a million <unk> a day.
Think of these 20 million genes or <unk> to <unk> <unk> to produce <unk> or <unk>, new <unk>, new <unk>, we can change, with a small team, and create more <unk> biology that we can change, with a little team, and create more <unk> biology biology that are now in the last 20 years of science.
And it's just a standard <unk>.
We can choose to <unk> <unk>, chemistry or <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This is a <unk> of some software <unk> that we're working on to be able to <unk> and design species to computers.
Well, we don't know how to be.
We know exactly how their code code.
Now we're <unk> on the <unk> <unk>.
You saw you also see <unk> from the <unk> was a <unk> experiment.
We <unk> <unk> <unk> as <unk> as soon as <unk> as <unk> as soon as the <unk> or <unk> <unk> as the <unk> or different kinds of <unk>.
But the only way the biology can have a big impact without <unk> <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the <unk> would be <unk> the CO2 in the matter of the cost of food, so we're working on to design cells that can achieve this goal, and we think we can have the first <unk> <unk> of <unk> in about months.
The <unk> light <unk> with CO2 is a <unk>, but in our <unk> <unk> in our <unk> <unk>, we found different <unk>.
This is a <unk> that we <unk> in <unk>.
<unk> in the deep ocean, about <unk> feet of <unk> at the temperature of water.
<unk> <unk> from CO2 using hydrogen <unk> as a source of energy.
We're trying to understand if we can <unk> the CO2, which can easily be <unk> by <unk>, <unk> that can easily be <unk>, to drive this process.
So, the short <unk> we think that we could be able to <unk> what the basic question is what life is, "We, we have the <unk> goal of <unk> the entire <unk> industry.
<unk>. If you can't do it from TED, where can you?
It's a main source of energy.
And also, we're working for the same <unk> to create <unk> <unk>.
You saw this year with flu, we're always back in a year and with a dollar in less when you're <unk> to find the right right.
I think that's what you can change by <unk>.
That's how the future could start to look at <unk>, now, the tree of evolution with bacteria <unk> bacteria, <unk>, <unk>, and finally cells.
We are so <unk> people.
Our goal is to do so we can live enough to try to <unk> them. Thank you very much.
First of all, I'm going to show you, the <unk> <unk>, some <unk> work, the new technology that we took <unk> to a <unk> <unk>. It's <unk>.
It's a environment that you can <unk> both <unk> <unk> with a huge amount of data.
We're seeing <unk> <unk> with a <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk>, for a fast <unk>, <unk> <unk>, for a fast <unk>, <unk> the images like we want.
And it doesn't matter how big the amount of information that we see, how big these are <unk> of data, how much these are <unk> of data, or images.
Most of them are <unk> photographs, but this is a <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk>, and I'm <unk> in the <unk> of 300 <unk>.
It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that <unk> the <unk> of a system like this is the number of <unk> on your screen at any moment. It's also a very <unk> architecture.
This is a whole book, example of data, not of images.
This is the <unk> <unk> <unk>. Every <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk>.
So, to <unk> that's about the <unk> and not of images, we can do something like that, to actually see that it's a real <unk> of the text, not a picture.
It could be a way of <unk> to read a <unk> <unk>.
I don't <unk> it.
This is a <unk> example. This is a <unk> number.
Every picture is the beginning of a <unk>.
And it really gives you the <unk> and the good experience of reading the real version of a <unk>, which is for nature a <unk> <unk>, which is for nature a <unk> kind of a <unk>.
We also did something with the corner of this particular number in the <unk>.
We created a <unk> <unk> <unk> much <unk> than what you use is using in a normal <unk> <unk>, and we <unk> it from the <unk> content.
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk>, you can see here.
Or other models, or even the <unk> <unk>.
And that really <unk> some of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of space on the screen.
And that <unk> this <unk> <unk> to <unk> and other <unk> <unk>, and other <unk> <unk>, not to be <unk>.
Of course, the <unk> is one of the most <unk> <unk> for this kind of technology.
And on this, I don't want to lose time, if not to say that we have <unk> to <unk> from that.
These are all the streets in the U.S. <unk> over a NASA <unk> picture.
So now I'm going to do something else.
This is actually live on the web; you can <unk> it.
It's a project called <unk>, which <unk> two different technologies.
One is <unk> and the other is a <unk> research that's very interesting <unk> computers made by <unk> <unk>, a student of the <unk> of Washington, with the help of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And it's alive on the web, <unk> by <unk>.
You can see when we do this kind of <unk>, where we can go from a picture to the other one and have this kind of experience <unk>.
But the <unk> <unk> of the images here actually actually actually.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> are <unk>. They <unk> these pictures together, so that they <unk> to the <unk> <unk> all near the <unk> <unk> <unk> are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> have been <unk>. Here you see some <unk> of a <unk> <unk> or <unk>, and these things were all <unk> <unk> <unk>.
I don't know if I've time to show you some other environment.
There are some much more <unk>.
I want to go directly to one of the <unk> of the <unk> data, and this <unk> from a <unk> <unk> of <unk> that we've done for the first time, I <unk> to show you what <unk> is really the key to behind this technology, the <unk> technology. And it's not <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> that we put in the website.
We had to <unk> <unk> and so on.
This is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> of <unk> in <unk>, other <unk>, other <unk> of the <unk> and so on. <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> a picture that's discovery.
So, I'm all <unk> <unk> from <unk> and they were all <unk> at the <unk> level like this.
And it's possible to <unk> this <unk> way.
You know, I would never have thought of <unk> to work.
It's very <unk> <unk> this kind of <unk> here.
I think you can see that it's a lot of different kinds of <unk>: from those <unk> to the <unk> <unk>, a number of <unk>, a <unk> number, <unk> together in this environment.
And if I can, I can <unk> to look at the <unk>.
There are many <unk> <unk>, etc.
<unk>, somewhere here is a series of photographs -- <unk>.
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We can go from the <unk> to the physics of this environment.
The <unk> point is that we can do things with the social environment. This is <unk> data from the entire memory of how the land, from the <unk> point of view and <unk> all that data.
All those pictures become <unk> together, more than the <unk>.
You have a model of the entire <unk> that <unk>.
Think about this as the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> on Earth.
It's something that <unk> in <unk> complexity as people <unk>, and the <unk> that you can <unk> for the <unk> <unk> with the use.
Their pictures are <unk> with <unk> <unk> by other people.
If somebody comes to the idea of <unk> all these <unk> <unk> the name, my picture of the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> all of that data, and I can use it as a <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> in that space, using the <unk> of everyone else, and have a social experience of <unk> and <unk>.
Of course, a <unk> of all that are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of every interesting part of the earth, not just <unk> <unk> <unk> and from <unk> and <unk>, but from memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Do you know? What your software <unk> us to do is that at some point, in the next few years, all the photographs of <unk> from everybody in the world's world almost <unk> together.
<unk>: Yeah. What's doing is basically <unk>.
It's <unk> <unk>, if you want, between pictures.
And it's doing it in the content of images.
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the <unk> of information that many of these <unk> images.
As you do a <unk> research images on the web, you <unk> a <unk> and the <unk> on the page has a lot of information about the pictures of the pictures.
Now, what's going if that picture <unk> all of your picture?
So the amount of <unk> <unk> and the amount of <unk> that <unk> is really enormous. It's a <unk> effect.
CA: <unk>, it's really amazing.
<unk>: I'm <unk> you.
One of the main <unk> when you <unk> and one of the <unk> research is that we can live between who has no <unk> <unk> <unk>, between who <unk> the past, in the wind <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk>, the <unk> <unk> of the plants.
You should think that <unk> <unk> <unk> still beyond <unk> <unk>, or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, or <unk> <unk> <unk> are still <unk> <unk> <unk>, or <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and that the idea that the world in which we live in which we don't exist in a <unk> sense, and that the idea that the world in which we live in which we don't exist in which we live in which we don't exist in which is a <unk>, in which is actually <unk> sense,
the <unk> of a particular <unk> of <unk> choices that our <unk> has done, good or bad, a lot of <unk> it.
And, of course, everybody <unk> <unk>.
Everybody <unk>.
We're <unk> <unk>.
We have to deal with the <unk> of death <unk>, so we can't <unk> and <unk> --
We all have art.
What <unk> is the <unk> <unk> of the song, the <unk> of the <unk> of every culture.
It doesn't matter that they are the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk>, or the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk>, or a <unk> <unk> in the heart of the <unk>.
He was my <unk> of <unk>, a month ago, or a <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk>, on the <unk>, the <unk> mother's mother.
All these <unk> <unk> us that there are other ways of <unk> other ways of thinking, other ways to move in the world.
And if you look at a moment, it's a concept that can give you hope.
<unk>, the <unk> of the world create a <unk> of life and <unk> that <unk> the planet, and it's important for the planet as the <unk> <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk>.
And you can think of this <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and you can <unk> the <unk> of all the <unk>, dreams, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, being <unk> in being from human imagination.
<unk> is the fantastic <unk> of humanity.
It's the <unk> of what we are and what we can be as as as a <unk> species.
And <unk> <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> was <unk> at <unk> and <unk> much <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, for example, <unk> that 50 percent of all the species has been or <unk> on the <unk> of <unk> because it's <unk>, or <unk> -- in the <unk> of <unk> diversity -- and you don't even <unk> to <unk> <unk> -- that's the <unk> diversity.
<unk> of that is, of course, the <unk> <unk>.
When you're <unk> <unk> <unk> on this planet.
A language is not just <unk> by a <unk> or a series of rules.
A language is the <unk> of the human spirit.
It's the middle of which the <unk> of every culture <unk> is coming in the world.
Every language is a forest of the mind, a <unk>, a <unk> of <unk>.
And of those <unk> <unk>, as we're here at <unk>, at least half doesn't <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of children.
They're not <unk> to children, which means that you don't know something, that's already death.
What's more <unk> than being <unk> by the <unk>, to be the last <unk> to talk to a language, the not to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> or <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> or the children's <unk>?
This <unk> <unk> was the state of someone in the world every two weeks: every two weeks, a <unk> <unk> and <unk> with them in the <unk> <unk> of a <unk> language.
And I know somebody of you will say, "<unk>'t it better?
The world would not be a better place if we all <unk> the same language? "<unk>, then we're talking about it.
<unk> <unk>.
<unk> of a <unk> thing that means we can't talk about their language.
I'd like to give you a journey through the <unk> --
a small journey in the <unk> to give you a <unk> of what we're <unk>.
Many of us <unk> that when I say, "different ways of <unk>," I really mean different ways of <unk>.
<unk> for example, this <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, the <unk> of the <unk>, which <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's a <unk> that's not able to <unk> the blue color from the green because the <unk> <unk> is <unk> in the forest, which <unk> the <unk>.
They have a <unk> language and a <unk> rule, <unk> <unk> <unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk>.
All of that has <unk> in the past <unk>, yet <unk> is that in these families, where you're talking about six or seven <unk> because of the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
You can hear and then I'll start talking about.
I <unk> one of the most interesting <unk> I've lived, the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, an amazing <unk> that had the first <unk> in <unk>.
In <unk> five <unk>, they <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
They made <unk> from the top photographs that <unk> them in <unk> that <unk> <unk>, <unk> that this <unk> of the <unk> forest <unk> had never seen anything.
They <unk> the picture from the earth, they <unk> it to <unk> a form or a <unk> and, not <unk>, they <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk>, and they <unk> the five <unk> with <unk>.
But the <unk> didn't just <unk> the <unk>.
They <unk> between them.
<unk> percent of the <unk> <unk> was <unk> by themselves.
We went to eight <unk> and we found two <unk> of natural death and when we <unk> to know, they <unk> that one of them was <unk> so that it's dead <unk>, and then <unk> <unk> it. So,, in all the way, had a <unk> knowledge of the forest.
The <unk> were able to recognize the animal <unk> from 40 <unk> and <unk> the species.
I was <unk> a very interesting job when my <unk> <unk> <unk>, I was really interesting <unk> when my <unk> <unk> <unk> me if I wanted to go to <unk> between the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> of the used to do <unk>.
To give a sense of <unk>, I should have understand <unk> culture and <unk> not <unk>.
It's pretty much about a <unk> <unk> vision of the world.
Very interesting.
If you're <unk> to <unk> the big <unk> of the world, what would you like?
<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, etc.
A continent has been left out, thinking that Africa doesn't have <unk> <unk> <unk>. And instead, the <unk> is not the <unk> of these <unk> <unk> very <unk> <unk> during the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
What makes interesting the <unk> is the <unk> relationship between life and death.
So <unk> do <unk> <unk>.
<unk> can be <unk> by the <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> in such a short moment the <unk> becomes the <unk>.
So, for the <unk> <unk> to say, "<unk> <unk>, you go to <unk> to speak about God.
We <unk> in <unk> and <unk> God. "
And from the moment that you're <unk>, is the spirit that you can <unk> you, how can you get you <unk>?
So, you're <unk> to these incredible events: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a rather <unk> of the power of the mind when it's <unk> in a state of <unk>.
<unk> all the <unk> that I lived with the <unk> <unk> are the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, in the <unk> <unk>.
<unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
In a <unk> continent <unk> of blood, this <unk> never been <unk> by <unk>.
And today, I'm <unk> by a <unk>, but their education is extraordinary.
<unk> <unk> are <unk> away from the families to three or four years, and live in a world fact that they're <unk> in a world <unk> <unk> for 18 years.
Two <unk> years <unk> of nine years, <unk> of the nine months of <unk> <unk> that <unk> in the <unk> of the mother, now are <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
For this time, they are <unk> to the values of their society, values that <unk> their <unk> and just their <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or to say, to <unk> <unk> <unk>.
At the end of this incredible <unk>, they're <unk> out and for the first time in their lives, they see a <unk>. And in that moment of the first <unk>, when the sun <unk> <unk> <unk>, everything that they learned in the <unk> <unk>, everything that they learned in the <unk> <unk>, everything that they've learned in the <unk> theory, it's <unk> in its <unk>. <unk> does a <unk> <unk> does it <unk>.
"<unk>? <unk>, how I said.
It's <unk>. Now it's <unk> to you. "
They call <unk> <unk> and say that we, <unk> <unk>, we are the <unk> of the world's <unk>.
This level of <unk> is extremely important.
When we think of <unk> <unk> and the <unk> environment and the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, which is a <unk> concept in his <unk> or maybe <unk> <unk> and we say that these are <unk> <unk> to the Earth.
<unk> <unk> are not <unk> or <unk> <unk>.
There's no space for these things in the <unk> <unk> of <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, but because of the time and <unk>, they created a <unk> of the Earth <unk> <unk>, not on the concept of <unk> <unk> <unk>, but on a <unk> <unk>, the idea that the Earth can only only only live because it is <unk> by human <unk> of the human <unk>.
What does that mean?
You know, a <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> that the mountain is a <unk> spirit that <unk> is going to be a human being <unk> different and will have a <unk> different <unk> and will have a <unk> <unk> of <unk> that <unk> a mountain of <unk> that <unk> is a <unk> of <unk> to be <unk>.
which is the <unk> of a spirit or a <unk> <unk> is <unk>.
What's interesting is the <unk> that <unk> the relationship between the <unk> and the natural world.
I grew up in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that the <unk> <unk> to be <unk>.
That made me a human being different from my friends who believe that <unk> are the <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> that live in the <unk> <unk>, <unk> that live in the <unk> <unk>.
If we start <unk> that these <unk> can actually create reality, different <unk>, we can start understanding some of them <unk>.
I <unk> this picture in <unk> in the <unk> <unk>.
Maybe some of you have heard about <unk>, the most powerful <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk>.
What makes the <unk> is not the potential <unk> of the <unk>, but its <unk>. It's <unk> by two elements.
On one hand, this <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> a series of <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
<unk> the only <unk> has a <unk> <unk> that <unk> a little bit, but it's <unk> with the <unk> of a <unk> <unk>'s family <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This <unk> <unk> <unk>, very similar to the <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
If you're going to see the <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk> that's <unk> do that make a different <unk> of the <unk>, it's <unk>.
<unk> that <unk> on the <unk> is a little bit like being <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a sea of electricity. <unk>'t create a <unk> of reality; it makes the <unk> of reality.
I often <unk> with my <unk>, Richard <unk> <unk>, the man who <unk> <unk> <unk> was <unk>, with his discovery of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> years,
<unk> my <unk> can't <unk> these <unk> as you can't <unk> these <unk>, because if you can't tell anybody to be <unk>. <unk>, but they can't be <unk> because they're <unk> by a <unk> that's <unk>, of course, in <unk>.
It's possible to <unk> <unk> only if you <unk> with other <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk>.
Now, the <unk> that are in this <unk> are <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, the same <unk> necessary to <unk> the <unk>. The question <unk> <unk>: in a <unk> <unk> <unk>, in a <unk> of plants, how do these <unk> <unk> to <unk> two <unk>, not similar, but that if you <unk> in this way, they create a <unk> version that's.
We use the big <unk> of <unk> and <unk>, which can <unk>.
But if you look at the <unk>, we'll <unk> "<unk>" <unk> "<unk>". "
What does that mean?
This <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, which <unk> <unk> in the forest, and that our eyes will be in the same species.
If you look at it as <unk> their <unk> <unk> us, "<unk> <unk> <unk> of plants, you don't know it?" I said, "No."
The solution is, you take the <unk> <unk> in a night night of the moon and <unk> <unk> with a different <unk>.
With this one is not <unk> to <unk>, but it's much more interesting that <unk> <unk>.
Now, <unk> the problem is that even those of us who have heart <unk> <unk> <unk> them are <unk>, but somehow <unk> to the <unk> of the history of the real world, and <unk> beyond.
In fact, the <unk> century, in 300 years, not <unk> <unk> for its <unk> or its <unk> <unk>, but rather like the <unk> was where we <unk> and we <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> diversity and <unk> <unk> of the <unk> diversity and <unk> of the planet. Now the problem is not the change.
All the <unk> through the <unk> have been <unk> in a <unk> for new possibility of life.
And the problem is not technology.
<unk> <unk> have no <unk> to be <unk> when they put <unk> <unk> and <unk>, so as the <unk> have <unk>, when they <unk> don't have <unk> to be <unk> when they put out of <unk> and <unk>.
It's not the change or technology that <unk> the <unk> of <unk>. It's the power.
The <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And if you look at the world, I'll see that these are not <unk> <unk> <unk>.
They are creatures <unk> and <unk> <unk> out of the existence of <unk> forces that are beyond their <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> --
a <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, a <unk> that has been <unk> <unk> in the forest to a generation ago, and now <unk> to the <unk> <unk>, where you can see the <unk> <unk> <unk>, where you can see the <unk> <unk> from the <unk> that looks like <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>,
We started <unk> with the <unk> <unk> to the forest.
Or, in the case of <unk>, are the diseases that are <unk> with the <unk> discovery.
If you look at the <unk> of the <unk>, where I'm doing a lot of research, you'll see the <unk> of the <unk> of politics.
As the <unk>, the <unk> physics of a <unk>, is <unk> at the <unk> level, but the <unk>, the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of a <unk>, not just <unk>, but <unk> <unk> in certain <unk>, because it's part of the development.
And you can't understand the <unk> of the <unk> until you get out of the beginning.
I've <unk> miles from <unk> in the <unk> <unk> through the <unk> <unk>, <unk> with a young <unk>, but just <unk> to <unk>, I realized what's behind.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> million people <unk> from the <unk> during the <unk> <unk>.
The father of this guy was <unk> at <unk> <unk>.
which means that it was <unk> at the time of the Chinese <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> that brought the <unk> in <unk>.
My mother was <unk> and his <unk> was to be <unk>.
It was taken by <unk> <unk> in <unk> at age two <unk> under his <unk> because he couldn't have to live without him.
The <unk>, who did the same, was <unk> in <unk>.
One day has <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> and, for this <unk>, was <unk> to the work <unk> for seven years.
The pain of the <unk> can be <unk>, but the spirit of the <unk> is <unk> by <unk> there.
So, all of all, they <unk> to a choice.
How do we live in the world <unk>, or we want to <unk> the world's <unk>?
The big <unk> <unk> <unk>, before he died said that his greatest fear was that, in our <unk> to go to this <unk> <unk> <unk>, not just <unk> the entire entire <unk> of human imagination <unk> to a <unk> <unk> of human imagination, <unk> to a <unk> <unk> that there were other possibilities.
And it's <unk> to remember that our species has been <unk> for <unk> years.
The <unk> <unk>, which has given us to agriculture, which has <unk> us to the <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> with the <unk> of the <unk>, by <unk> <unk>, by <unk> <unk> years ago.
<unk> world <unk> <unk> 300 years.
That <unk> story, I don't <unk> that we have the answers to all the challenges that we could <unk> in the <unk> to come.
When these <unk> <unk> of the world is asked what it means to be human, <unk> with <unk> <unk> different <unk>.
And it's in these answers that we all <unk> the possibility of being what we are, sort of, a <unk> species that has to be <unk>. And there are big times as <unk>.
I <unk> this picture on the <unk> <unk> of <unk>, when I went to <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk>, and this man, <unk>, <unk> me, <unk>, <unk> me the wonderful story of his <unk>.
The government <unk> was not always <unk> with the <unk> <unk> and in the '<unk> to <unk> our <unk>, and in the' <unk> to <unk> our <unk>, we <unk> them in <unk>.
The <unk> of this man <unk> <unk>.
The family, <unk> for his life, the <unk> <unk> all the <unk>, and all of his <unk>.
You know, the <unk> doesn't <unk> the cold,
The <unk> of <unk> <unk> were made of fish <unk> in <unk>.
The <unk> of this man didn't <unk> out of the night or <unk> <unk>.
It's <unk> away, it <unk> the <unk> in <unk> and <unk> in your hand. When I did it, I <unk> it, he <unk> it <unk> it into a <unk>.
He <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk> of <unk> and when <unk> <unk>, he <unk> a dog.
He <unk> the dog and created a <unk>, with the <unk> <unk> <unk> created a <unk>, he <unk> another dog and it's <unk> on the <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>.
You should talk about <unk>? [<unk>] and that, in different ways, [<unk>] is the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and all the <unk> <unk> of the world.
<unk> <unk> <unk> the government <unk> <unk> to <unk> the total control of an area of bigger <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's their new <unk>. It's called <unk>.
It's a <unk> <unk>. We <unk> all the resources.
One <unk> example of how a <unk> can <unk> with his <unk>.
And, to end, I think it's pretty <unk> at least at least at the <unk> areas of the planet, <unk> that they don't have <unk> at all.
For someone's home.
<unk> <unk> of human imagination, which <unk> <unk> <unk>. And for all of us, the dreams of these children, like our children of our children, become part of the hope.
And to end, we <unk> <unk>, we're <unk> that <unk> never <unk>.
<unk> that <unk> --
<unk> <unk> are not <unk>, but we believe that stories can change the world, and maybe we're the best <unk> to tell the stories of the world. Every month our <unk> site <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> our <unk>.
Our <unk> are <unk> by millions of people.
Our work is <unk> in the <unk> to bring our public in <unk> <unk> <unk> from which which <unk> <unk> from which <unk> <unk> from which <unk> <unk> from which <unk> <unk>, <unk> to <unk> the <unk> of <unk>, the <unk> world, and we have to find a <unk> <unk> in a world of <unk> and <unk>.
where the <unk> of all the <unk> can <unk> to our <unk> <unk>.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some of the things that I wrote in this book that I hope you've already heard and <unk> to <unk> some <unk>, in the case you don't <unk> them.
So, I'd like to start with what I call "the <unk> <unk>."
The <unk> <unk> of what?
The <unk> <unk> of all the society <unk>. The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>: "If we want to <unk> the <unk> of our citizens" The way to do it is <unk> freedom to <unk>. "
The reason is, on one hand, in fact that the freedom is itself, is <unk>, <unk>, <unk> for humans.
On the other one is in the fact that if we're <unk>, every one of us can act to do everything that <unk> our <unk>, without any one one <unk> in our own name.
The way to <unk> the freedom is to <unk>.
More choices people have, more <unk> are <unk>, and more their freedom, is their freedom, more <unk>.
This, <unk>, it's so <unk> <unk> in the society that no one <unk> <unk> in <unk>.
And it's also <unk> <unk> in our lives.
I'm going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible.
This is my <unk>. It's not particularly big.
I <unk> a simple note on the <unk> to <unk>.
In my <unk>, there's <unk> <unk>, <unk> the 10 <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and 12 <unk> <unk> that you can buy for a huge number of <unk> in the <unk> <unk> that no one of the <unk> already <unk> <unk> that no one of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that no one of the <unk> <unk> <unk>, which no one of the <unk> already <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> of your <unk>.
That's what the <unk> is.
Then you go to the store <unk> to buy a <unk>: <unk>, <unk> <unk>, radio, <unk>, radio, <unk>.
And in this single <unk> store, there's a big number of <unk>.
We can make six million different <unk> using the <unk> that there are just a <unk> store that there's just a store.
<unk> <unk> that there's <unk>.
<unk> fields: the world of <unk>.
Once, when I was a child, you could get all the services <unk> <unk>, <unk> that were <unk> by <unk> <unk>.
They <unk> the phone, you don't <unk> it.
And so, as a <unk> of that, was that the phone <unk> never.
These days, these days,
We now have a <unk> <unk> <unk>, especially between the cell phones.
Here's the cell phones.
My <unk> is in the middle, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, and <unk> for the <unk> <unk>.
If you can't have it yet seen in the <unk> <unk>, you're <unk> <unk>.
And what's the end of the end is that people <unk> to <unk> and this question. And you know, the answer is, "Is it." No. "
It's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn't make things.
So, in other <unk> of life that are much more important than <unk>, <unk> the same <unk> of choices.
<unk> <unk>: not happens in the United States that you're <unk> from the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> you know what you have to do.
Instead, <unk> from the <unk>, and the <unk> says, "OK, we could do it." And it's got these <unk> and these <unk> <unk> "<unk> has these <unk> and these <unk> <unk>. What do you want to do?"
You <unk> him, "<unk>, what do you want to do?"
And the <unk> says, "He's got these <unk> and these <unk>, and <unk> has these <unk> and these <unk>."
"What do you want to do?"
And you said, "<unk> if she was me, what would you say?"
And the <unk> said, "I'm not her."
The result we call it "<unk> <unk>", "<unk>", "<unk>", "<unk>", "<unk>", "<unk>", "<unk> <unk>", "<unk> <unk>", "which is the <unk> <unk>, which makes it look like a good thing.
But actually, it's not that a <unk> <unk> and the <unk> of making decisions from someone knows something, <unk> the <unk>, to <unk>, <unk> that nothing knows nothing -- and of course, it's <unk> -- and of course, it's not <unk> to make the patient.
There's a huge <unk> of <unk> products, <unk> to people like me and you, that if you think about it is not any sense, because we can't <unk>.
But if we can't <unk>, why do we <unk> them?
The answer is that they want you to <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> so <unk>, as the <unk> is our <unk> now is a question of choice, as you can see in this <unk>. "We don't want to <unk> children. We don't want to <unk> <unk>.
And we can <unk> how many times we <unk>.
which means that every <unk>, <unk>, you have to decide that kind of person.
<unk> to the family and <unk>, a time the common common perspective, <unk> almost for anyone, was that there was the <unk> as soon as possible.
The only real choice was with who, not when, and even what to do after.
<unk>, everything is really to play.
<unk> to <unk> very smart, and they <unk> 20 percent <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And not because they're <unk>, not because they're <unk> <unk>.
But why they're <unk>, <unk> to <unk>, "<unk> <unk>, or not?"
"<unk> <unk> <unk>? I have to think before? I have to think about the children or to career?"
They are <unk> <unk>.
And I try to answer these questions, even if this <unk> doesn't <unk> the <unk> that <unk> and not get a good <unk> to my <unk>.
And they really have to do that. They're important questions.
Now, the work: we're <unk>, like <unk> <unk>, because the technology <unk> us to work every minute, every day, from every corner of the planet, <unk> that from the <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, there's a <unk>, and I'm not going to say nobody, where the <unk> works.
I don't tell you, because I want to use it.
What does this incredible freedom to choice that we have about work? It's that we have to decide, <unk> it all moment, if we have to work or not.
We can go to see our son to play <unk>, with the cell phone in a <unk>, the <unk> in the other, and the <unk>, <unk>.
And even if I'm all <unk>, every minute that's <unk>, we're also <unk>, "I have to <unk> this call?"
"Do I have to <unk> this <unk>? I have to <unk> this letter?"
And even when the answer is, "not," all that makes the experience of your son very different from what would be in other conditions.
So, from all of the <unk>, small things, and big, <unk>, the materials and big, life is a question of choices.
Once the world was this: <unk>, there were some possibilities, but it wasn't all about choice.
The world today <unk> to this: <unk> is, "It's a <unk> thing, or <unk>?"
The answer is <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk>, we know, so I'm going to talk about <unk>.
<unk> that choice <unk> two effects <unk> on people.
The first one, <unk>, is that it <unk> <unk>.
With many <unk> between which you choose, it becomes very difficult to do it.
So, I'll give you an <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
A <unk> my <unk> had access to the data of the <unk>, the <unk> society of <unk> <unk>, with about a million <unk> <unk> <unk> in different companies.
What she found out is that for every 10 solutions that are <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of two percent.
With 50 <unk> <unk>, there's 10 percent less than <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>. Why?
Because with 50 <unk> <unk> that you choose, is to <unk> difficult to decide, and choice is <unk> to <unk>.
And <unk>, and yet <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and of course, <unk>, and of course, <unk> never comes.
<unk> that doesn't just mean that these <unk> <unk> <unk> food to <unk> because they don't have enough money, it wants to say that the decision is so <unk> that you can also <unk> the decision <unk> <unk> <unk>.
They don't know, they're <unk> up to five <unk> <unk> for the year's <unk> <unk>, which would be <unk>.
So the <unk> is a <unk> of having <unk> choices.
And I think it's going to be <unk>.
"And to end, to end, <unk>, <unk> or <unk>?"
You know, you can really do the right decision, if it's for the <unk>, right?
You don't want to choose the wrong <unk>, and <unk> the wrong <unk>.
So that's the first effect. The second is that even if we can <unk> <unk> <unk> and make a choice, at the end, we're less <unk> by the result of how you have been <unk> with less <unk>.
And that's why I'm going to do that for several reasons.
One of them is that with many <unk> between which you choose, and it's not perfect, it's not perfect, it's easy to imagine that you could make a different choice that would be better. And that's that the <unk> <unk> us to <unk> the <unk>, and the <unk> <unk> from the decision, and the <unk> <unk> <unk> the decision,
And when it was a <unk> decision.
More choices there are, <unk> <unk> of any <unk> that <unk> is <unk> of choice.
<unk>, there's what <unk> call.
Dan <unk> has <unk> very well <unk> like the value that we give things to the <unk> things that we give <unk>.
<unk> else, when there's so many <unk> of them, it's easy to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and be <unk> <unk> of the <unk> that's choice.
Here's an example. I <unk> with all the people who are not in New York.
But that's what you probably know.
There's this <unk> to the <unk>.
It's a place of <unk>.
<unk>. <unk> day. It's all for them.
<unk> nothing. But what he thinks it's, "Well, <unk>, it's <unk>."
"All my <unk> <unk> are away."
"<unk> <unk> right in front of the house."
And it's about two weeks, I'm going to <unk> -- every day -- the possibility of <unk> where it wants.
The <unk> <unk> <unk> for what we have, even when choice was <unk>.
And the <unk> are the <unk> that we have from <unk>, the <unk> <unk> us <unk> against how <unk>.
Here's another example.
This <unk> tells us a lot of things.
It's about to live the moment, and maybe maybe a living living slowly.
But the most important point is that anything you want, you know, you're <unk>'t <unk>.
The things that don't know, they have a lot of <unk> that can make less <unk> what we do.
<unk> <unk>: <unk> <unk>.
I tried it on my skin <unk> a new couple of <unk>.
It's <unk> always <unk>.
Once the <unk> were just like, I <unk> them and <unk> <unk>, they were <unk>, just after <unk> a <unk>, and I was <unk>, just after <unk> a life, and I was going to go well.
So, I went to <unk> a couple of them when the <unk> were gone, and I need a couple of <unk>, this is my <unk>. "
The <unk> said, "Do you want to <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>?"
Do you want them to the <unk>? "<unk>" or "<unk>" or "<unk>"?
"
"<unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk>? <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> --" <unk> to <unk>.
I was <unk>, and after a little bit I was able to say, "I want the only guy that was," He didn't know what it was, so for a now, I <unk> all of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, then <unk>, and then I <unk> out of the store, I had ever <unk>.
It was the <unk>. With all that choice I had <unk> the best.
But it's worse.
Why? I wrote a whole book to <unk>.
The reason I was worse is that with all that choice my <unk> were <unk>, the <unk> <unk> to be <unk>.
At the beginning I had <unk> <unk>. I didn't know anything about <unk> when I just had one guy, but when I was 100 different, at least one guy had to be perfect.
What I had <unk> was good, but not perfect.
And after I <unk> that I was <unk> in <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> in the life of people do not <unk> the <unk> that these <unk> <unk> that they have <unk> <unk>.
And this <unk> less <unk>, even when the results are good.
<unk> in the world of <unk> <unk>.
Because if I <unk> it, I don't know what I'm talking about.
The truth <unk> to that.
"It was better when he was worse," The reason why he was better when he was worse was when he was worse was possible to <unk> <unk>.
<unk>, in the world that we live in -- <unk>, <unk> citizens with the <unk> of <unk> -- the <unk> that we can <unk> is that the <unk> <unk>.
You never have to be <unk> <unk> because your <unk>, my <unk>, my <unk>, <unk>.
The <unk> of happiness -- which you're here -- is, "<unk> <unk>" Yes, "<unk> <unk>," Yes, "you want it."
I mean -- small moment, <unk> -- that I'm really <unk> and my wife is really <unk>.
I couldn't do better, I couldn't <unk>.
But <unk>, it's not a <unk> thing.
<unk>, a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> when there's just that kind of <unk> is that when you're not <unk>, and you're <unk>, "Why?"
"Who is <unk>?" The answer is <unk>.
The world is the <unk>. What could I do?
When there's hundreds of <unk>, and I'll <unk> a <unk>, and I'll tell you who's the <unk>, it's clear that the <unk> are you.
I could do better.
With hundreds of <unk> <unk>, there are no <unk> for <unk>.
So when people make decisions, even if the result is <unk>, they <unk> <unk> and give them the <unk> to them.
In the last years, <unk> is <unk> in the <unk> world.
I think a <unk> <unk> -- not the only, but important -- of this <unk> <unk> is just that people have experiences because the standard are too <unk>.
And when they have to <unk> this situation think that <unk> is them.
So the final result is that we're <unk> better, we're better, <unk>, but we <unk> it.
Let me show you.
This is the <unk> <unk>, what we all take for for good and it's completely <unk>. It's not true.
There's no <unk> that a little bit of choice is better than <unk> at all, but that's not <unk> that much choice is better than a little bit better than that.
There's a <unk> value, <unk>. I don't know what it's.
But I'm quite sure we've <unk> from a piece of the level that the choices our lives.
Now, from the point of view <unk> -- I almost finished -- from the point of view, the <unk> is the <unk>.
What <unk> allows all this choice in <unk> society is the <unk> material.
There are many places in the world, and you'll <unk> <unk>, where the problem is not that they have <unk>.
The problem is they have too <unk>.
So the <unk> I'm talking about is a <unk> <unk> of <unk>, <unk> society.
And what <unk> does and <unk> is this: <unk> <unk> <unk> talked about yesterday about how <unk> and <unk> <unk> to <unk> are <unk>. It's a <unk> <unk>. It's a <unk> <unk> of money.
I mean that these choices, <unk> and <unk>, it's not that just <unk>.
They are <unk> <unk>.
They do worse.
If a little bit of what in our society allows choice to be <unk> to the <unk> in those where people are too few possibilities, it would not just be their life to <unk>, but our <unk>.
This is what <unk> call a <unk> <unk>.
A income <unk> to all -- not just the poor -- not just the poor -- because of this choice in <unk> that <unk> us.
And so, to <unk>, you can become everything you want to --
<unk>, people of culture, <unk>, "What's going to do that fish?"
"It's <unk> that you can't get anything in a glass <unk>."
"A <unk> imagination, a <unk> vision of the world --
and I <unk> it so, I <unk> it, at the beginning.
But then, I'm <unk>, instead, I realized that that fish knows the long <unk>.
Because the reality of <unk> is that if you <unk> <unk> the <unk>, so that it's all possible is possible to be not <unk> the freedom.
If you look at the <unk> so that it's all possible possible to <unk> the <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk>.
Everybody needs a <unk>.
This is almost certainly too <unk>, maybe for the fish, and certainly for us.
But the <unk> of some <unk> <unk> is a <unk> for the <unk> and, <unk>, for <unk>.
Thank you so much.
