<unk> year I showed these <unk> to <unk> that the <unk> <unk> <unk>, which for almost three million years had the size of the United States <unk>, <unk> of 40 percent.
I'm going to <unk> this problem because it doesn't show <unk> of the ice.
<unk> <unk> <unk> is, in a sense, the heart of the <unk> of the global warming system.
It <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
The next <unk> is going to be a <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of the last 25 years.
<unk> <unk> are <unk> in red.
You can see, they <unk> up to the blue <unk>.
That's the ice in <unk>, which <unk> in summer.
You can see that the <unk> ice <unk>, of five years or more, is like the blood here, which is <unk> from the body.
In 25 years, it's been <unk> by this.
This is a problem because the <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> that, the <unk> <unk> <unk> that, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, are <unk> in <unk> from <unk>.
<unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk>, that <unk> could <unk>, <unk> this point.
In some <unk> <unk>, the <unk> is already <unk> from the water.
The <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> is <unk> with a team <unk> <unk> <unk> last <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>! <unk>: She's good. The question is if we're <unk> it.
It's a reason that this <unk> <unk> <unk> from the north.
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It had never <unk> <unk> like that.
This is the <unk> <unk>, in the <unk> of <unk>.
If you want to know how the <unk> <unk> for the sea <unk> to <unk> on <unk>, here is where the sea.
These <unk> are <unk> <unk>.
<unk> the other part of the planet: <unk>, the greatest <unk> of ice on the planet.
<unk> month, the <unk> scientists that the <unk> of the ice is in <unk>, and that the <unk> <unk> on some <unk> <unk>, is particularly <unk> in <unk>.
<unk> at six feet of the <unk> of the <unk>, like in <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, the third largest <unk> of ice, you see new <unk>, which a few years ago.
40 percent of the world's population <unk> water from that <unk>.
<unk> <unk>: this <unk> is the source of <unk> water in this city.
<unk> is <unk>.
But when you get it, the same happens to the <unk> water.
In California, <unk> on <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> are in the crisis.
<unk>, like you read, they're <unk>.
<unk> <unk> in the world <unk> to a <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> are <unk> to a <unk> out of the normal and not <unk>.
Sometimes more <unk> in the last 30 years to the <unk> <unk>.
This is a <unk> of the whole <unk>.
If you look at it in the <unk> context, they can see the <unk>.
We've been <unk> 70 million <unk> of CO2 every 24 hours of CO2 in the ocean every day.
Look at the area of the <unk> <unk>, from <unk>, to <unk>, and both parts of the <unk> <unk>, where there's a <unk> <unk> of oxygen in the ocean.
The <unk> of the global <unk>, with <unk>, which is 20 percent, is the use of <unk> <unk>.
<unk> is a problem, and <unk> is even worse.
The United States is one of the two countries with <unk> emissions, with China.
And they're trying to build a lot of other <unk>.
But we're <unk> to a <unk> of direction.
These are the <unk> projects in the last few years and some <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
And so, there's a <unk> policy in our country.
<unk> <unk> and the oil <unk> <unk> million dollars in the last year to <unk> <unk>, which is a <unk>.
I would have a little bit --
<unk> <unk>, in <unk>, where I live, there was a <unk> of <unk> billion <unk> of <unk>.
Maybe you've seen it on <unk>.
This is the second largest flow of <unk> in America.
It's happened around <unk>.
<unk> <unk> of one of the <unk> of <unk> was this.
<unk>: <unk> ♫ ♫ <unk> the <unk> is a <unk> <unk>, and happy.
It's <unk> here in America, and we grow our economy.
<unk> the <unk> is <unk>.
It's <unk>, <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk>: From the <unk> here is a lot of <unk> <unk>.
The biggest <unk> society <unk> on the <unk> is <unk> <unk>. This is his <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> <unk>. <unk> <unk> -- Al <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> -- they don't know what they're talking about.
<unk>: So the <unk> <unk> <unk> two <unk>.
This is one of them, a part.
<unk>: <unk>: <unk> we see the <unk> changes as a <unk> <unk> to our business.
So we're <unk> a lot of money in a <unk> <unk> to make public and <unk> the truth to <unk>.
It's actually <unk>.
We think it's <unk> -- it also a good <unk>.
So we don't <unk> of climate change.
We could do it.
<unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk> -- you've heard a lot of it.
So we <unk> a <unk> <unk> structure for <unk> <unk>.
<unk>! <unk> are a little <unk>, but this is the <unk> of <unk> technology.
<unk> <unk> is between the <unk> of the <unk> of global warming, but the <unk> technology of <unk> that you see changes everything.
Let's look at a look at this: the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk> to the economic <unk> and the national security.
<unk>: <unk>: <unk> is in the crisis; the economy, national security crisis.
The <unk> that the <unk> of all: our <unk> from the <unk> <unk>, like <unk> and the oil <unk>.
Now, there's a new, <unk> <unk> solution to <unk>.
<unk> America: 100 percent of <unk> energy, in 10 years.
A plan to <unk> America to work, more <unk> <unk>, and help <unk> the global warming.
<unk>, a solution that we <unk> to solve our problems.
<unk> America. <unk> more.
<unk>: This is the last one.
<unk>: It's <unk> energy to America.
One of the most <unk> ways of <unk> <unk> to the <unk> that we <unk> our planet.
<unk>: The future is here. <unk>, sun, a new <unk> network.
<unk> <unk> two: <unk> <unk> for jobs well <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> America. It's time to be <unk>.
<unk>: A old <unk> <unk> says, "If you want to go to <unk>, you go from.
If you want to go far, you go together. "
We have to go far, fast.
Thank you very much.
<unk> year at TED, a <unk> on <unk>.
And we try to <unk> how the machine works.
So, there we go. And for the people who didn't have, the <unk> is the largest scientific <unk> experiment ever -- <unk> miles of <unk>.
His task is to <unk> the conditions that were <unk> less than a <unk> of a second from the beginning of the universe -- to <unk> million times a second.
That's just <unk>.
This is the machine under <unk>.
We're going to <unk> these <unk> <unk> into the <unk>.
This is what I work. It's called <unk> -- it's <unk> feet and it's <unk> feet.
This is a picture of <unk> <unk> in construction in the construction <unk>.
<unk> <unk> last year we <unk> the machine for the first time.
And this picture was <unk> by <unk>.
It was <unk> <unk> in control.
It's an image of the first <unk> of the particles that he had done all the <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, with a part of the <unk>, and <unk> particles inside the <unk>.
In other words, when you <unk> that image the 10 <unk>, you'll see that the machine, which is a great <unk>.
I don't know if it was this to <unk> us more or this, when somebody <unk> on Google and <unk> that the page was this.
That means we've had a <unk> impact beyond the scientific <unk>.
And we had a week later, there was a problem with the machine, had to be <unk> here -- these <unk> <unk> <unk>.
These <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> when the machine works at the <unk> of the <unk>.
Now, the <unk> between you to <unk> the <unk> and <unk>, "It's not true. I'm too <unk>."
And they can do that because when they're very <unk> become the <unk> <unk>.
So, <unk> degrees <unk>, to a temperature temperature <unk> to the space between stars, these <unk> can bring that <unk> to the <unk>.
In one of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> in <unk>, there was a <unk> of <unk>.
So the <unk> <unk> <unk>, and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
That was the result.
Now, this is even more <unk> if you think that these <unk> <unk> more than 20 <unk>, and they've <unk> about 30 <unk>.
They <unk> about 50 <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, what we did.
We <unk> them and <unk>.
They're now <unk> everybody to their <unk>.
<unk> the end of <unk> the <unk> is going to be again.
We <unk> it, and we try to get <unk> data to <unk> or <unk>, and continue so our <unk> to find out what the universe is.
Now, of course, in a certain way, these <unk> <unk> the <unk> of science and engineering engineering to <unk>. It's easy to <unk>.
I think the fact that it's so hard, the fact that it's so hard, I think this is the value of things like <unk>.
I would like to <unk> with the words of a <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, who, <unk> <unk>, in <unk> of <unk> experiments of the <unk> of his <unk> was Michael <unk>, said, "No, <unk> so <unk> to the <unk> of the human mind as the <unk> that the ideas of science are <unk>, that there are not <unk> in nature, that our <unk> are <unk>, and that we don't have to be <unk> by <unk>.
Thank you.
I want to start <unk> <unk> to when, from children, <unk> with <unk>.
<unk> <unk> like <unk> and <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, actually to think and solve <unk> problems.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to the way we <unk> most of the world around us.
So, from <unk> <unk> <unk> of our <unk> with <unk> objects, and I <unk> <unk>, and my <unk> <unk> <unk>, and my <unk> <unk> <unk>, I started <unk>, "And if we use a computer, instead of having the <unk> of the <unk> as a digital <unk> that's moving on a <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. And then I started <unk> <unk> <unk> with the hands,
and do we <unk>?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer, by building the <unk>.
In a few words, a <unk> is a <unk> computer <unk> as a <unk>.
In a few words, a <unk> is a <unk> computer <unk> as a <unk>.
You can <unk> them with the hand, they can "<unk>" <unk> "between them, feel their movement and have a <unk> radio.
But <unk>, they're <unk> objects, like <unk>, you can just <unk>.
<unk> is the example of a new <unk> of tools to <unk> digital information.
And as they become more <unk>, <unk> of their movement, other, and as they become more <unk>, <unk> of their movement, of their <unk>, of their own movement, we can explore new and <unk> <unk> <unk>.
I'll start with some simple example.
This <unk> is <unk> to show you some video: if you're going to <unk> it in a direction, the video <unk> so, if we'll get to the other <unk> back.
These <unk> <unk> are <unk> of others.
If you <unk> them, they <unk> what they're going to around.
If they're <unk>, they can <unk> it and they can <unk> a little bit.
If they're <unk>, they can <unk> it and they can <unk> a little bit.
We also <unk> their movement and <unk>.
We've got to realize that one of the interesting <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk>.
In this case, we have three <unk> <unk> as a <unk> of <unk> and I can <unk> to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk>, where they're <unk>.
and I can <unk> to <unk> the <unk> of the central color, where they <unk>.
If we can <unk> it, we can <unk> a little bit.
There are also <unk> possibility of <unk>, like <unk>, <unk> and games where people can <unk> the <unk> and games that people can <unk> things things, and <unk> the results immediately.
I'm now --
This is a <unk> <unk> that I do with a <unk> program.
Here we have a word of <unk> <unk> and <unk>.
<unk>, at every <unk> <unk> a letter to <unk> on every <unk>, <unk>, <unk> to every <unk> <unk> a letter on every <unk>, and while I was <unk> <unk> words, he <unk> on a <unk>.
Then, after about 30 seconds, you get <unk>, and you have a new <unk> of <unk>.
Thank you.
Here we have kids in <unk> <unk> <unk>, I did so that I <unk> them and I <unk> a video.
They're very very much.
And one of the interesting things of <unk> is that you don't have to give people a lot of <unk>.
It's just to say, "<unk> <unk>," and they know what to do.
Here we are other people who <unk> it.
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> there.
It really wanted to <unk>.
They were just <unk>, for him.
Now, this is a <unk> of a <unk> <unk>.
We could build a tool for the <unk> of <unk>. He's <unk>.
It can <unk> new characters in the scene, <unk> their <unk>.
It can <unk> new characters in the scene, <unk> their <unk>.
So, it's going to get out the sun.
<unk>: The sun is <unk>.
David <unk>: Now he's <unk> a <unk> in the scene.
<unk>: The <unk> <unk>.
<unk>! Yeah!
So we <unk> the <unk> and <unk> can <unk> the characters --
<unk>: <unk>!
<unk> your own story.
<unk>: <unk>!
<unk>: It's a very <unk> story, and it can decide how they <unk>.
<unk>: It's a very <unk> story, and it can decide how they <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> away, <unk>.
<unk>: The last example I have time to show you is a tool, made of a recent <unk>, and made of music.
It's a <unk>, made of <unk>, to <unk> and <unk> music.
The <unk> here are <unk> <unk> as basic, and the <unk>.
<unk> of these have four different <unk>, and you can choose what to use.
You can also <unk> these <unk> in a <unk> <unk>.
And they just <unk> a <unk> a sound and a sequence. "
These are actually that you can control from live, like <unk> and <unk>.
I'm going to <unk> it to a particular sound and then <unk> to <unk>.
And then there are the <unk> effects like time and <unk>, which is <unk> to the entire sequence.
It works.
<unk>: <unk> <unk>, <unk> a <unk> <unk>, "<unk> a <unk>," the <unk> in a series, the <unk> <unk>, <unk>.
Now we're going to take a <unk>.
<unk>: Now, I'll <unk> <unk> --
<unk>: And now I'm going to <unk> the <unk> to the <unk>, so I can control control the effect of alive.
<unk>: <unk>: I can <unk> the whole sequence <unk> the <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the time from one or the other.
<unk>: And now we're going to <unk> the <unk> to give the <unk> to the <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> the sequence of the <unk> <unk>.
So I don't have to <unk> before, but I can <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
And now, finally, I can <unk> the whole sequence <unk> on the left the <unk> <unk>.
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is to build new <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to how our brain work and body.
And today, I've had time to show you one of the results of the <unk> of this path, and also some possibilities we try to bring out of the lab.
So the idea I want to <unk> is that it's <unk> this new generation of <unk> objects to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> that we want.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the time I'm going to talk to all of you.
I'm a <unk>.
<unk> books is my <unk>, but it's more than this, of course.
It's also love and love <unk> of my life.
And I don't look like it to change.
But, I said this, something particular happened in my life and my life, and in my career, who led me to <unk> the whole relationship with this work.
The particular thing is I <unk> wrote this book, this <unk> called "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
And the result is that everywhere, I'm <unk> now, people <unk> me as if I <unk>.
<unk> -- <unk>, <unk>!
I'm going to be <unk>, and they say, "You don't fear of them to be able to do better?
You don't have fear to write all the life without being able to create a book that can <unk> to make a book that can <unk> someone? "
What can you get to someone? "
It's <unk>, you know.
But it could be worse, except that I remember more than 20 years ago, when I started to say to people -- I was a <unk> --
I'm going to <unk> the same <unk> <unk>.
And people said, "Do you don't think I could be able to be successful?
Do you don't have fear <unk> <unk> you?
You don't have fear of this <unk> for all life without anything to be <unk> out of it and die on a <unk> of <unk> <unk>? "
So, you know.
The short answer -- the short answer to all these questions is, "Yes."
Yeah, I fear of all those things.
I've always had fear.
And I also fear of many other things that people couldn't <unk>.
How <unk> and other things <unk>.
But, as it is, I'm going to write what I thought and <unk> me is why?
Is it <unk>?
It's <unk> that anybody who <unk> <unk> to be <unk> by a job that you feel born to do.
But what's so particular is in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in a way that other <unk> don't do?
How do my father, for example, he was a <unk> <unk> and I don't remember one time in his <unk> years of activity where asked her to be asked if she was <unk> to be <unk>?
There was never -- that <unk> of <unk> John, how it goes?
<unk> not so, <unk>?
<unk>, engineers <unk> as a group of course, in <unk>, <unk> the <unk> of being <unk> <unk>.
We <unk>, we have enough this <unk>, and not only <unk>, but we have this <unk> to be <unk> <unk>.
And they don't know anything else that we look at the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> that, only in the <unk> century, <unk> young, and often for them.
And even the ones that don't seem to be really <unk> by their <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, before they die, in the last <unk> said, "My book," <unk> my book, "<unk> me a little more <unk>." And I <unk> <unk> <unk> about his life.
But we don't <unk> <unk> when we say, because we've heard these things so long that somehow we have completely <unk> and <unk> the <unk> that creativity and <unk> the <unk> that creativity and <unk> are in some ways to <unk> and <unk> the art, at the end, always <unk>.
And the question I want to <unk> all here is, you agree with this?
It's good for this -- because even <unk> from a <unk> distance to me. It's not good for anything that <unk>.
I think it's <unk>.
And I think it's also <unk> and I don't want to <unk> in the next century.
I think it's better <unk> our great <unk> <unk> to live.
And I certainly know that, in my case -- it would be very <unk> to start <unk> to that <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> the <unk> <unk> in which I'm in my career.
<unk> -- <unk> look at it's quite young, I've got about 40 years.
I still have about four <unk> of work in me.
And it's very <unk> that everything <unk> in the world as the work that it will be <unk> by the world as the work that <unk> after <unk> <unk> in my last book.
<unk> <unk>, because we're all <unk> friends here -- is <unk> that my greatest success is to my <unk>.
Oh, <unk>, <unk>, what thought!
You know this is the kind of the thought that leads to <unk> <unk> at nine in the morning, and I don't want to do it.
I'm going to be doing this work that I love.
So, the question is, how?
And so it seems to me, after many <unk>, that the way to work to write is to create a <unk> <unk> <unk>, right?
I have to have a little bit of <unk> between me, which I'm <unk>, and my natural <unk> to what's written about, and the natural <unk> to what's going to happen to look through the time, looking for other society to see if we have any better ideas and see if we have better ideas and see if we have some better ideas and <unk>'s better ideas.
about how to help people <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity.
And that research led me to the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
It's because they <unk> in <unk> and then <unk> back.
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> -- people don't believe that creativity <unk> from men, OK?
It <unk> that creativity was this <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> to men from some <unk> <unk> and <unk>, for reasons <unk> and <unk>, for reasons <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> <unk> these <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk>.
<unk>, <unk>, <unk> to have a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> were the same idea, but we'll have that the <unk> of the spirit without a <unk>.
which is <unk>, because the <unk> didn't really understand that a <unk> was a very smart <unk>.
And I think that a <unk> was this species of <unk> <unk> that was <unk> literally in the <unk> of the study of a artist, a little bit like <unk>, and that we <unk> out out of <unk> the <unk> of the artist and <unk> the <unk> of that work.
<unk> <unk> here, that's the distance I'm talking -- that <unk> <unk> that you're <unk> from the results of your work.
And everybody <unk> that was so that they would be <unk>, right?
So artists <unk> were <unk> to <unk> things, like the too <unk>, you know?
If your work was <unk>, you don't <unk> <unk> all the <unk>, everybody <unk> that <unk> state from this <unk> <unk>.
If your work <unk>, it was not <unk> your <unk>, right?
Everybody <unk> that was your <unk> to be a <unk>.
And so people are <unk> to <unk> creativity in <unk> for a long time.
Then the <unk> <unk> and everything <unk>, and <unk> this great idea; we put the human being at the center of the universe, and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and <unk> and not <unk> space to the <unk>.
This was the principle of <unk> <unk> and people to think that creativity is <unk> by <unk>.
And for the first time in the history, it <unk> to <unk> this or that artist as a <unk> rather than a person with <unk>.
And I have to <unk>, I think that was a big <unk>.
I think you're going to be like a <unk> as a source of as a source of as a source, as a <unk> as a source of all of the <unk> <unk>, <unk> and <unk> and <unk> is a responsibility to <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's like to ask someone to <unk> the sun.
<unk> and <unk> completely the <unk> and create all these <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk>.
And I think it was this pressure to have <unk> artists in <unk> 500 years.
And if that's true, and I think it's true, and I think it's, the question now becomes, and right now?
Can we do it?
It will be back to a more <unk> understanding of the relationship between humans and <unk> <unk>.
or maybe not.
Maybe we can't <unk> 500 years of thinking in a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And there's probably people in the audience who <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on their <unk>, <unk>, you do <unk> people <unk> <unk> <unk> on their projects.
You probably don't <unk> all about this.
But the question I want to ask you is -- why don't it?
Why don't we <unk> it this way?
Because it's more sense of anything that I've ever heard to explain the <unk> of the <unk> process.
A process that, as anybody who ever <unk> to do something -- so, so, we're all here -- knows, you don't know.
And, in fact, it can sometimes look completely <unk>.
I did this <unk> <unk> with the extraordinary <unk> <unk> <unk>, who has now 90 years, but that was a <unk> for life and said that during his <unk> in <unk> <unk>, <unk> out in the <unk> <unk>, <unk> out in the <unk> <unk>, <unk> out in the <unk> <unk>.
He said he was like a a <unk> <unk>.
And that <unk> <unk> to her from <unk>.
I would <unk> him to come up, because he <unk> the ground under his feet.
I was <unk> to have one thing to do that point and was, words, "<unk> like a <unk>."
And we went to the house and he was <unk> by this <unk>, and he wouldn't have to get anything to a paper <unk> and a <unk> <unk> enough <unk>, and <unk> <unk> on the page.
Sometimes it doesn't <unk> to be enough enough, so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> without able to get to the house and <unk> the <unk> through the <unk> and she would <unk> the <unk> through the <unk>, to, to, how she said, "another <unk>."
Then there were those times -- this <unk> <unk> never -- there was any time -- there were any time when it was almost <unk>, OK?
So, he was <unk> back to the paper and he was looking for paper and <unk> the <unk> through, and he <unk> a <unk> right in the while he was <unk> with the other hand and <unk>.
It <unk> the <unk> from the tail and <unk> into his body and the <unk> on the page.
And in these cases, the <unk> would be <unk> on the <unk> page, and <unk>, but the <unk>, the last word to the first word.
So when you <unk> <unk> -- it's exactly <unk>, it's exactly <unk> to my <unk> process.
Not all my <unk> process -- I'm not a <unk>!
I'm a <unk>, and my way of <unk> is; I'm going to <unk> at the same <unk> every day and <unk> to work and <unk> on top of the <unk>.
But even I was, in my <unk>, I <unk> against that thing, sometimes.
And I think many of you will <unk> that.
You know, even if the work and ideas <unk> me to be <unk> by a certain source I couldn't <unk> <unk>.
And what is this?
And how can we <unk> it in a way we don't lose your head, but rather, that it's <unk> <unk>?
As a <unk>, as a <unk> <unk> I have been the <unk> <unk> <unk>, which I've <unk> several years ago for a <unk>.
I'm talking about this, and you know, <unk>, for the <unk> of life has been the <unk> of the <unk> artist, <unk> these species of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
But then <unk>, he was <unk>, and a day while he was <unk> on a <unk> <unk>, <unk> everything for him.
It's going fast fast and everything is a <unk> this little <unk> of <unk>, which comes into his head as <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, and you want, you know, it's wonderful, and the <unk>, but it doesn't know how to <unk>.
It's not a <unk> of paper, it doesn't have a <unk>.
So it starts to feel this species of old <unk> <unk> <unk> in him, "I'm going to lose, and <unk> <unk> from this song.
I'm not enough <unk> and I can't <unk>. "
And instead of going to <unk>, they <unk>.
<unk> the whole process and made something completely new.
He just looked at the sky and said, "<unk>, you can't see I'm <unk>?"
"Do you think it's a song now?
If you really want to <unk>, you'll <unk> it at a <unk> moment.
<unk>, we're going to <unk> <unk> more.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. "
And his process <unk> <unk> <unk> after that.
Not the work, the work was still <unk> as always.
But the process, and the <unk> <unk> that <unk> was <unk> when <unk> the <unk>, the <unk> that the <unk> that out of him <unk> <unk> that out of the problems and <unk> it back from where he was, that he didn't have to be something <unk> and <unk>.
but I was <unk> this <unk>, <unk> <unk> a conversation between <unk> and this <unk> thing that <unk> and <unk> <unk> that it was not <unk>.
So how much I <unk> that story to change a little bit even the way I'm going to do and already <unk> me.
This idea, I <unk> when I was <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and I <unk> into one of the <unk> of the <unk> that we all have been working on something and we can't think it's going to be a <unk>, that it will be the <unk> book.
Not just <unk>, just the <unk> book.
And we start to think about <unk> this project.
But then I <unk> to <unk> that <unk> the air and <unk> us.
So I <unk> my face on the <unk> and <unk> my <unk> to a <unk> of the room.
And I said <unk>, "<unk>, what, we know, we know that if this book is not going to be <unk>, don't it?
Because as you see I'm <unk> everything I have, I don't have more of this.
So if you want it to be better, you have to <unk> and do your part.
OK. But if you don't do it, you know what, I don't like.
I started to write the same because it's my job.
And I would like to be <unk> that I'm <unk> to do my part. "Because at the end is so, OK -- <unk>, OK -- <unk>, <unk>, in the <unk> of the <unk> of the moon, <unk> and <unk> music that would be <unk> to the moon, and <unk> that they would <unk> for hours to the <unk>.
And they were always <unk>, because the <unk> were <unk> and they were <unk>.
But every once a lot, <unk>, something <unk>, and one of these <unk> artists actually <unk>.
And I know what I'm going to talk, because I know I know that you've all seen, at some point, a <unk> like this.
It was as if the time <unk>, and the <unk> <unk> through a species of <unk> and he was nothing different from the <unk>, like the <unk> <unk> before, but it was <unk>.
And suddenly we don't just <unk> as a human.
But they <unk> from <unk> and <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk>.
And when this <unk>, at the time, people <unk> what was, he <unk> him with his name.
<unk> your hands and <unk> to <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, God," God, "God," God, "God,"
That's God, you know.
<unk> <unk> <unk> -- when the <unk> <unk> the <unk> of <unk>, <unk> this <unk> with them and <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> by "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>," <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>," <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>," which you can feel in <unk> or in <unk>.
In <unk>, when a artist has done something impossible and <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> -- a <unk> of God.
And it's <unk> because we need.
But the problem comes the next day, for the <unk> itself, when they <unk> and <unk> <unk> that are 11 <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> it.
It's just a <unk> with a lot of <unk> <unk>, and maybe never <unk> to <unk> that <unk>.
And maybe no one <unk> the name of God still as <unk>, and what does it have to do with the rest of his life?
It's hard.
This is one of the most <unk> <unk> to do in a <unk> life.
But maybe it doesn't have to be so <unk> if you can't believe, you know, <unk>, that the most <unk> of your being being being by.
But let me just show you that data in <unk> from a <unk> of this <unk> part of your life that you have to <unk> somebody else when you're finished.
And, you know, if we think that's all change.
And so I started <unk>, and it's certainly like I <unk> it for several months during the <unk> of the book that I was soon, the <unk>, <unk> <unk> of my <unk> success.
And what I have to continue to <unk> when I feel <unk> from this is, I don't feel fear.
It doesn't <unk>. It's just your job.
You can <unk> for your <unk>, any of it can be.
If your work is <unk>, <unk>.
If the <unk>, you'll be <unk> <unk> <unk> to you <unk> a few kind of <unk>, for just a moment through your <unk>, then "<unk>!"
<unk>, you do the same your <unk>.
And "<unk>!" <unk>! "<unk>!"
I think it's <unk>.
"<unk>!" <unk>! "<unk>" <unk> "<unk>" <unk> "<unk>" <unk> "<unk>" <unk> "<unk> <unk> <unk>."
Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk>: <unk>!
As you know, I've already talked about some of these projects on the human genome, what it can <unk> and the <unk> of <unk> new genes.
We're now <unk> a new path: we started <unk> biology and start <unk> to the biology and now starting from that digital code we're <unk> into a new <unk> of biology, <unk> and <unk> life.
We always tried to <unk> great questions.
"What is life?" It's something that many <unk>, I think they're trying to figure out different levels.
We tried different <unk>, <unk> to the <unk> terms.
We're <unk> for almost 20 years.
When we <unk> the human genome <unk> to <unk> from the <unk> of biology to the digital world.
Now we can <unk> life, or create new life from this digital universe?
This is a map of a little <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk>, which is the <unk> species from the <unk> genome between those that can <unk> into the lab.
And we tried to reduce the genome to <unk> one even smaller.
We're able to <unk> a <unk> of genes of about 500 that are here.
But when we look at the <unk> map, it's simple than our.
<unk>, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes we can <unk>, one at the time, it's very <unk> that this can bring to a <unk> cell.
So we thought the only way to <unk> was <unk> this <unk> to <unk> some of these questions.
So, we started the <unk> of "<unk> <unk>" <unk> a <unk>? "
Can the chemistry <unk> of produce these great molecules that we've never been able to create before we do?
And, in case we can make a <unk>?
<unk> is just a piece of <unk> material.
The speed we're able to <unk> life is <unk> to <unk> <unk>.
Our capacity to write the code, instead, <unk> rather slowly, but it's <unk>.
And our <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We've <unk> more than 15 years ago.
The process has <unk> a lot of <unk>, <unk> with a <unk> <unk> before they <unk> the first experiments.
But we've found that DNA <unk> is very difficult.
There are <unk> of thousands of cars in the world that are small <unk> of DNA <unk>, <unk> of 30 to 50 <unk> and it's a <unk> process.
So we had to develop a new <unk> to <unk> these <unk> and <unk> the <unk>.
And this was our first <unk>, starting from information digital information of the <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
It's a little virus that <unk> bacteria.
We designed the <unk>, we <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> a DNA <unk> of about <unk> <unk>.
The interesting part is when we took this piece of <unk> material <unk> and we <unk> it into the bacteria, the bacteria have <unk> to read this code and <unk> the <unk> particles.
<unk> <unk> <unk>.
I've talked about the recent members of the <unk> industry that they've got certainly <unk> this model.
They have more than you.
And we think this is a situation where the software can actually build the same <unk> into a <unk> system.
But we could do the biggest things in the big.
You could build the whole <unk> of <unk>.
They're more than <unk> <unk> <unk>.
So we thought of <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> virus, so that we can change the <unk> to understand what the <unk> of a cell.
<unk> is <unk>, and if we <unk> that information into a computer, these must be very <unk>.
When we <unk> this genome for the first time in <unk> the <unk> <unk> was a <unk> for every 10 <unk> <unk>.
We found, <unk>, 30 <unk>. If we were using that original sequence will never be able to do that work.
One part of the process is to design <unk> 50 <unk> that <unk> with all the other <unk> of 50 <unk> to build smaller <unk> that <unk> together.
<unk> elements here.
You've probably read that <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> of those <unk> <unk> together <unk> <unk> <unk>, and there's a <unk> order to <unk> every <unk>.
So we can use the code for <unk>, <unk>.
What we did at the beginning was <unk>.
Some of them were <unk> by the fact that it doesn't <unk>.
We designed these <unk> to <unk> <unk>.
There are <unk> that <unk> them and <unk> them.
And we started <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
At every step, we've made these <unk> <unk> so that we're <unk> to create a <unk> <unk> that we're going to create a minute.
We're trying to <unk> the process.
So, this seems to be the <unk> of a <unk> of <unk>.
When you get to these <unk> <unk> <unk>, more than 100 <unk> <unk>, you don't get <unk> directly to the <unk> <unk>.
It's <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of <unk> biology.
So we've <unk> other <unk>.
And we're going to <unk> a <unk> called <unk> <unk>, which in biology <unk> to <unk> the DNA to <unk> the <unk>.
Here's an example.
This <unk>, called <unk> <unk>, can <unk> three million <unk> of <unk>.
You can see in the <unk> <unk> as his <unk> is <unk>.
And in 12 hours, it's <unk> exactly as it was before.
<unk> thousands of organisms that are able to do that.
These organisms can <unk> completely.
We're going to live under <unk>.
They're absolutely absolutely sure that life <unk> into space, and they <unk> to find new <unk> of water.
Actually, NASA showed that this is happening.
This is a picture of the <unk> that we've built using these <unk>, just using the <unk> with the <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This picture was not <unk> with a <unk> <unk>, but with a <unk> <unk>.
It's so big we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk>.
These are pictures that <unk> a period of about six seconds.
This is the <unk> we've done a little time ago.
They're more than <unk> <unk>.
It's the biggest <unk> of a <unk> <unk> structure ever <unk> from man.
It's got a <unk> <unk>.
If we <unk> it with a <unk> 10 <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, just <unk> pages to <unk> this code.
Now, how do we do it work? How do we <unk> it?
<unk>, of course, is a <unk> <unk>.
It's a little more <unk> when you're using bacteria.
It's <unk> when it's <unk> cells like our -- you can just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> another, which is basically the process of <unk>.
In <unk>, the <unk> <unk> is instead <unk> into the cell, but we <unk> <unk> that we're able to do a <unk> <unk> of a cell to another cell to another and <unk>.
We <unk> a <unk> <unk> by a species.
The two are different as men from <unk>.
We <unk> some <unk> in a way that we could decide what to have to have this <unk>.
He <unk> it with the <unk> so that we <unk> all the <unk>.
And when we put it in the cell, and we <unk> our <unk> <unk> the new <unk> went into the cell.
And we could <unk> that not go beyond, but we tried to <unk> it more in there.
This is one of the major <unk> of evolution.
We found that <unk> species have <unk> a second or a third <unk> somewhere, <unk>, <unk> in a second thousands of new <unk> to that species.
So who think about evolution as a <unk> at the time that <unk> has not <unk> a lot of the biology.
<unk> of the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> that was in the cell, they didn't <unk> one.
The <unk> <unk> we <unk> it.
It <unk>, and he <unk> the other <unk> as <unk> material, <unk> it, and we <unk> only with the cell and the new <unk>.
It's become blue because of the genes we've <unk>.
And in a short time <unk>, all the <unk> of a species are <unk> <unk>, and you've <unk> of all the <unk> of into a new species, <unk> on the new software that we <unk> into the cell.
All the <unk> are <unk>, and the <unk> are <unk>, and when you <unk> the code that we've <unk>.
Now this may seem <unk> <unk>, but we can <unk> the software, we can change things quite <unk>.
Now, I've already <unk> that there is not a <unk> of <unk> -- but of progress <unk> to <unk> -- but of progress at progress from three and a half million years of evolution, and I said that we're going to create a new version of <unk>, where we're going to be new species on this digital process.
Why do that?
I think it's quite <unk> when we think of our <unk>.
We're going to go from six and a half billion people in the next 40 years.
Just to give an example: I was born in <unk>.
There are three people on the planet to <unk> <unk> in <unk>; in 40 years, there will be four.
We're <unk> problems now to find food, water and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> for six billion people.
We're going to be able to do it for nine billion.
<unk> more than five billion <unk>, more than 30 billion <unk> of <unk>.
That means 100 million <unk> a day.
When we try to find <unk> <unk>, or any kind of process to <unk>, it's going to be a huge challenge.
We have to <unk> the whole <unk> of CO2 from the materials that we <unk> into the atmosphere.
At the day, through the <unk> <unk> around the world, we have a <unk> with about 20 million genes, and I like to think that are <unk> for the future.
<unk> <unk> only one <unk> about <unk>, and you think of how many different things are <unk> out.
Our <unk> here is <unk> data from reality and our imagination.
We now have <unk>, <unk> to these <unk> <unk> <unk>, to create what we call <unk> <unk>.
We're able to build a big robot that can produce a million <unk> a day.
Think of these 20 million genes or <unk> to try to <unk> the <unk> to produce <unk> or <unk>, new <unk>, we can change, with a little team, and create more <unk> biology, we can change, with a little team, and create more <unk> biology biology, and create more <unk> biology biology, and create more <unk> biology biology, which we can change, in the last 20 years of science.
And it's just a standard <unk>.
We can choose to <unk> <unk>, chemistry or <unk>, production of <unk> <unk>.
This is a <unk> of some some <unk> software that we're working on to be able to <unk> and design species to computers.
Well, we don't know how they will be.
We know exactly how their <unk> is.
We're now <unk> on the <unk> <unk>.
You also see you that <unk> from the <unk> was a <unk> experiment.
We <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> enough, <unk> enough from <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> as soon as <unk> as <unk> or <unk> different kinds of <unk>.
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the <unk> would be <unk> the CO2 in matter before, so we're working on to design cells, and we think we can reach the first <unk> of <unk>, and we think we can get the first <unk> of <unk> generation in about 18 months.
<unk> <unk> <unk> with CO2 is a <unk>, but in our <unk> <unk> in the world, we found different <unk>.
This is a <unk> that we <unk> in <unk>.
It's <unk> at the deep ocean, at about <unk> feet of <unk>.
It <unk> <unk> from the CO2 using hydrogen <unk> as a source of energy.
We're trying to understand if we can <unk> the CO2, which can easily be <unk> by <unk>, <unk> that CO2 in <unk>, to drive this process.
So, we think that we could be able to <unk> what the basic question, "What is life" is, we, we have the <unk> goal to <unk> the whole industry.
<unk>. If you can't do it from TED, where can't you do it from TED?
It's a <unk> of energy.
And we're working on the <unk> <unk> to create <unk> <unk>.
You've seen this year with flu, we're always back a year and with a dollar <unk> when you're going to find the <unk> right <unk>.
I think what you can change by building <unk> <unk>.
That's how the future could start to look like <unk>, now, the tree of evolution, <unk> the evolution with bacteria <unk>, <unk>, and finally <unk> cells.
We are so much to <unk> people.
Our purpose is to make a long enough of living enough to try to <unk> <unk>. Thank you very much.
First of all, I'll do the <unk> possible, some fundamental work of the new technology that we took <unk> <unk> to a <unk> <unk> a year ago.
It's a environment where you can <unk> is at the local level that <unk> with a huge <unk> of data.
We're seeing <unk> <unk> <unk> with a <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> the images with a <unk> <unk>, <unk> the images like we want.
And it doesn't matter how big the amount of information that we see, how big these <unk> are these <unk> of data or images.
Most of them are common pictures, but this is a <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of <unk>, and <unk> in the <unk> <unk> of <unk>.
It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that <unk> the <unk> of a system like this is the number of <unk> on your screen at any moment. It's also a very <unk> architecture.
This is a book, example of data doesn't than images.
This is <unk> <unk> <unk>. Every <unk> <unk> is a <unk>.
So we think it's really <unk> and not images, we can do something like this, to really see that it's a real <unk> of the text, not a picture.
It could be a little <unk> to read a book.
I'm not going to <unk> you.
This is an <unk> example. It's a number of The <unk>.
Every picture is the beginning of a <unk>.
And it really gives you the <unk> and the beautiful experience of the real version of a <unk> or a <unk>, which is for nature a kind of a <unk>.
We also did something with the corner of this particular number of the <unk> of the <unk>.
We've created a <unk> <unk> much <unk> than what you use in a normal <unk>, and we've <unk> some of the <unk> content.
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk>, you can see here.
Or some <unk>, or even the <unk> <unk>.
And this really <unk> some of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of space on the screen.
<unk> that this <unk> <unk> to the <unk> and other <unk> <unk>, not to be <unk> to be <unk>.
Of course, the <unk> is one of the most <unk> <unk> for this kind of technology.
And on this, I don't want to lose time, if not to say we have <unk> <unk> to this field.
These are all the <unk> in the U.S. <unk> above an <unk> picture.
So now we're going to do something else.
This is actually live on the web; you can go to see it.
It's a project called <unk>, which <unk> two different technologies.
One is <unk> and the other is a <unk> <unk> computer computer very interesting, made by <unk> <unk>, a student of the <unk> of Washington, with the help of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And it's alive on the web, <unk> <unk>.
You can <unk> when we do this kind of <unk>, where we can go from a picture to the other and have this kind of experience to <unk> <unk>.
But the <unk> <unk> of the images here actually actually have a meaning.
<unk> <unk> in the computer <unk> have <unk> these images together, so that we <unk> to <unk> places where the <unk> all <unk> <unk> all <unk> <unk> <unk> are <unk>. There are all <unk> of a <unk> <unk>, or <unk> <unk>, and these things are all <unk> at the <unk> <unk>.
I don't know if I've time to show you some other environment.
There are some much more <unk>.
I want to go to one of the <unk> <unk> data, and this <unk> from a <unk> <unk> of <unk> that we've done for the first time, I'll show you what <unk> is really the key behind this technology, the <unk> technology. And it's not so <unk> to look at the <unk> that we have in the website.
We had to <unk> some of the <unk> <unk> and so on.
This is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> images <unk> from <unk>. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> of kinds of <unk> and <unk> of kinds of <unk> and <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, and you're going to be able to this model.
So they're all <unk> <unk> and they're all <unk> <unk> <unk> in this way.
And it's possible to <unk> this <unk>.
You know, I would never have thought of <unk> to work for <unk>.
It's very <unk> to <unk> this kind of <unk> here.
I think we'll see that it's a lot of different kinds of <unk>: from those <unk> to <unk> <unk>, a number of <unk>, <unk> together in this environment.
And if I can, I <unk> to try to find those <unk>.
Many of them are <unk> by <unk>, etc.
<unk>, somewhere here is a series of photographs -- <unk>.
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We can <unk> the <unk> of this environment.
The <unk> point is that we can do things with the social environment. This is <unk> data from the <unk> memory of how to <unk> the Earth, from the <unk> <unk>, and <unk> all that data together.
All those pictures become <unk> together, more than the <unk> of the parts.
You've got a model of the entire <unk> that <unk>.
Think of this as the <unk> of the work of <unk> <unk> on Earth.
It's something that <unk> in complexity as people <unk>, and the <unk> that they're <unk> for who are <unk> with the use.
Their pictures are <unk> with <unk> <unk> by other people.
If somebody is the idea of <unk> all these <unk> <unk> the name, my picture, my picture of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> all of that data, and I can use it as a <unk> <unk> to <unk> in that space, in that <unk>, using the <unk> of anybody else, and have a social experience kind of <unk>.
Of course, a <unk> of all that are very <unk> <unk> of every interesting part of the Earth, <unk> not only by <unk> <unk> <unk> and images and <unk> and <unk>, but from <unk> <unk>.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I realized? What's your software <unk> to do is that at some point, in the next few years, all the photographs <unk> from everybody in the world's <unk>.
<unk>: Yes. What's doing is basically, we're doing is <unk>.
It's creating <unk>, if you want, between images.
And it's <unk> the <unk> of images.
The thing becomes very interesting if you think of the <unk> information that a lot of these images.
As you do a research <unk> on the web, you <unk> a <unk> and the <unk> on the <unk> page has a lot of information about images.
Now, what's going on if that picture <unk> all your picture?
So the amount of <unk> <unk> and the amount of <unk> that <unk> is really enormous. It's a <unk> <unk>.
CA: <unk>, it's really incredible. <unk>.
<unk>: I'll give you a lot.
One of the major <unk> when you <unk> and one of the <unk> research is the to be that we can live between who doesn't <unk> the <unk> <unk>, the past the wind, <unk> it into the <unk> <unk> of plants.
You might think that <unk> <unk> still beyond the <unk> <unk>, or the <unk> of <unk> <unk> are still <unk> <unk> <unk>, or <unk>, the <unk> <unk> still the <unk> of <unk>, or <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk>, and that the idea that the world in which the world in which the world in which we don't have in a <unk> way, but it's only a <unk> of the <unk>,
the <unk> of a particular <unk> of <unk> choices that our <unk> did, well or evil, many <unk> ago.
And of course, everybody <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Everybody <unk>. Everybody <unk>.
We're <unk> to <unk> <unk>.
We have to <unk> the <unk> of death, so we don't <unk> if we <unk> and <unk> --
We all have a art.
What <unk> is the <unk> of the song, the <unk> of the song of every culture.
It doesn't matter that they're <unk> <unk> <unk>, or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk>, the <unk> of <unk>, or a <unk> in <unk>'s heart of <unk>.
He was my <unk> of a journey in <unk> a month ago, or a <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk> of the world, the <unk> of the world.
All of these <unk> <unk> that there are other ways of <unk> other ways of to think, other ways of to move in the world.
And if you take a moment, it's a concept that can give you hope.
<unk>, the <unk> of the world create a <unk> of life and <unk> that <unk> the planet and <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> of the planet as the <unk> <unk> as <unk>.
And you can think of this <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and you can <unk> the <unk> of all the <unk> of all the <unk>, the <unk> of all the <unk> of the <unk> of all the <unk> of the <unk>.
<unk> is the <unk> <unk> of humanity.
It's the <unk> of what we are and what we can be as <unk> species.
And <unk> the <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, for example, <unk> that 50 percent of all species has been or is on the <unk> of <unk> because it's <unk>, or <unk>, or <unk>, in the <unk> of <unk> diversity -- and and not even <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> diversity.
The <unk> of this is, of course, the <unk> <unk>.
When you're <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on this planet.
A language is not only <unk> by a <unk> or by a <unk> of rules.
It's a language <unk> of the human spirit.
It's the middle that the <unk> of every culture comes in in the material world.
Every language is a forest of the mind, a <unk>, a <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
And of those <unk> <unk>, as we're sitting here at least <unk>, at least half it's not <unk> in the <unk> of children.
They don't get to the children, which means, unless you're <unk> something, which is death.
What's more <unk> than the <unk> of being <unk> by the <unk>, of being the last to speak to a language, to have not to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of kids?
This <unk> <unk> has been the state of someone in a part of the world every two weeks: every two weeks, a <unk> <unk> and <unk> the <unk> of a <unk> language.
And I know somebody of you say, "<unk>'t that better?
The world would not be a better place if we could all the same language? "<unk>, then we're all going to talk about it. <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>.
<unk> of a <unk> thing is to say that you can't speak your language.
I'd like to give you a journey through the <unk> --
a little journey in the <unk> to give you a <unk> of what we're <unk>.
Many of us <unk> that when I say, "different ways of <unk>." I mean, "I really mean," I mean, "I really think we're <unk> different ways of <unk>.
<unk> for example, this <unk> <unk>, in <unk> <unk>, the <unk> of <unk>, which <unk> to the <unk> of <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's a <unk> that's not able to <unk> the blue color from the <unk> because the time <unk> is <unk> in the forest, where the <unk> is <unk>.
They have a <unk> language and a rule rule, <unk> <unk>, "<unk> <unk>": you have to <unk> a person who's talking about a different language.
All of this <unk> in the past <unk>, the <unk> is that in these families <unk> where you're talking about six or seven <unk> because of the <unk> <unk> <unk> no <unk>.
It's <unk> and then we'll start talking.
And I <unk> one of the most interesting <unk> that I lived in, the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, an incredible <unk> that had the first <unk> in <unk>.
In <unk> five <unk> have <unk> a <unk> <unk>.
They've done <unk> by photographs that <unk> them in <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk>, <unk> that this <unk> of the <unk> forest had never seen anything.
They <unk> the picture of the ground, they <unk> it to <unk> a form or a <unk>, and not <unk> anything, they've <unk> that <unk> <unk> of <unk>, and they <unk> the five <unk> to <unk>.
But <unk> don't only <unk> the <unk>.
They <unk> between them.
<unk> percent of the <unk> <unk> was <unk> by their own.
We're <unk> eight <unk> and we found two <unk> of death and when we <unk> to know, they <unk> that one of them was so <unk> that they <unk> died, and then they <unk> it.
<unk> were able to recognize the animal <unk> from 40 <unk> and to <unk> the species.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>, and I was really interesting to when my <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> my <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> of <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
For a sense of <unk>, I should have understand the <unk> culture and that <unk> is not <unk>.
It's quite a <unk> <unk> view of the world.
Very interesting.
If you <unk> to <unk> the <unk> of the world, what would you like to be?
<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, etc.
A continent comes out, thinking that Africa doesn't have <unk> <unk>. And instead, and so <unk> is not the <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
What makes it interesting to <unk> is the <unk> between life and death.
So <unk> are <unk> the <unk>.
<unk> can be <unk> by the <unk> <unk>, <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the live in so that for a little bit of the <unk> becomes the <unk>.
So, the <unk> <unk> to say, "<unk> <unk> go to <unk> to speak of God.
We <unk> in <unk> and <unk> God. "
And the moment you're <unk>, is the spirit that you're <unk>, how can you get you wrong with it?
So they <unk> to these incredible events: <unk> <unk> in <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of the power of mind when it's <unk> in a state of <unk> <unk>.
<unk> all the <unk> that I've lived with the most <unk> <unk> are the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, in <unk> <unk>.
<unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that once <unk> on the <unk> <unk> of <unk>, the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk>.
In a blood continent <unk> of blood, this <unk> never been <unk> by <unk>.
In <unk> today, they're <unk> by a <unk>, but they're <unk>.
<unk> <unk> are <unk> away from <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk>, and live <unk> in a world fact that they're <unk> and <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> for 18 years.
Two <unk> of nine years <unk> by the way to <unk> the nine months of <unk> that <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk>.
For all this time, they're <unk> to their society, values that <unk> that their <unk> and only their <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or to say, <unk> <unk> <unk>.
At the very <unk> of this incredible <unk>, they're <unk> out and for the first time in their life, at the age of 18, they see a <unk>. And in that moment, of the first <unk>, when the sun <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the <unk>, everything they've learned in the <unk> of his <unk>. <unk> it does a <unk> <unk>. It's going to say,
"<unk>? I'll tell you how I said.
It's <unk>. Now it's going to be <unk>. "
They call <unk> <unk> and say we, <unk> <unk>, we are the <unk> of the world's <unk>.
This level of <unk> is extremely important.
When we think of <unk> <unk> and the <unk> environment and the <unk> environment and the old <unk> of <unk> <unk>, which is a <unk> in his <unk>, or maybe <unk> and say that these <unk> are more <unk> to the Earth.
<unk> <unk> are not <unk> or <unk> <unk> from <unk>.
There's no space for these things in the <unk> of <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk>, but because of the time and <unk>, have created a <unk> of the Earth <unk>. It doesn't <unk> to <unk> <unk>. But on a <unk> <unk>, the idea that the Earth can only to live only because it's <unk> by the <unk> of the human <unk>.
What does it mean?
I mean that a <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> <unk> that the mountain is a <unk> of <unk> to be <unk> <unk>. It's a human being being <unk> different and will have a <unk> different relationship with the mountain or that place than a <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> that a mountain is a <unk> of <unk> to be <unk>.
That's a <unk> of a spirit or a <unk> <unk> is <unk>.
What's interesting is the <unk> that <unk> the relationship between the <unk> and the natural world.
I grew up in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> to be <unk>.
That's a human being friends from my <unk> who believe that <unk> are the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> that live in the <unk> <unk> of the world, <unk> that <unk> during the <unk> <unk>.
If we <unk> that these <unk> can create reality, different, we start to <unk> some of their <unk> <unk>. We can actually <unk> some of these <unk>.
I <unk> this picture in <unk> in <unk> <unk>.
Maybe some of you have heard about <unk>, the most powerful <unk> of <unk>.
What makes the <unk> is not the potential of <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk>.
<unk> one side, this <unk> <unk> a series of <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
<unk> the only <unk> a <unk> of a <unk> <unk> that <unk> a little bit, but it's <unk> with the <unk> of a <unk> of the family <unk> said <unk>.
This <unk> <unk> <unk>, very similar to the <unk>, <unk>.
If you'll see the <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> that are doing from a different <unk> of species, it <unk>.
It's like that <unk> on the <unk> is a little bit like being <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a sea of electricity. It doesn't create a <unk> of reality.
I often <unk> with my <unk>, Richard <unk> <unk>, the man who <unk> the man who <unk> the <unk> was <unk>, with his discovery of <unk> <unk> in the <unk>.
And my <unk> is not <unk> these <unk> as a <unk>, because if you're done not <unk> to be <unk>.
It's possible to <unk> only if we <unk> with other <unk> <unk> that <unk>.
Now it's the <unk>: the <unk> that are in this <unk> are <unk> of <unk>, the same <unk> to <unk> the <unk>. The question <unk> <unk>: in a <unk> of <unk> species of plants, how these <unk> <unk> to <unk> two <unk>, not the <unk> that, but if they <unk> in this way, they make a <unk> version of the <unk>?
We use the great <unk> of <unk> and <unk>, which can <unk> <unk>.
But if we <unk> to the <unk>, we'll <unk> us "<unk>" <unk> "."
What does it mean?
This <unk>, the <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, who <unk> <unk> in the forest, and our eyes are going to in the same species.
If they <unk> their <unk> <unk> us, "<unk>" <unk> "<unk>" <unk> "<unk>" <unk> "<unk>" <unk>. "
The solution is: you take the <unk> <unk> in a night moon, and you're <unk> with a different <unk>.
With this not <unk> to <unk>, but it's much more interesting to <unk> the <unk>.
Now, the problem is that even the ones that have <unk> the <unk> <unk>, but somehow we <unk> to the <unk> of the history of <unk> than our real world, and <unk> it beyond.
In fact, the <unk> century, by 300 years, not <unk> <unk> for his <unk> or his <unk> <unk>, but rather like the was where we <unk> and we <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the diversity and <unk> the <unk> of the planet. Now the problem is not the change.
All the <unk> through the <unk> have been <unk> into a new possibility of life.
And the problem is not technology.
<unk> <unk> don't have <unk> to be <unk> when they <unk> <unk> and <unk> as much as the <unk> have <unk> to be <unk> when they've <unk> <unk> and <unk>.
It's not the change or technology that <unk> the <unk> of <unk>. It's the power.
The <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of <unk>.
And if you look at the world, we'll see that these are not <unk> <unk> to <unk>.
They are <unk> creatures and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> --
a <unk> <unk> of <unk>, in <unk> <unk>, a <unk> that has been <unk> free in the forest to a generation ago, and now we'll go to the <unk> <unk>, where you can see the <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>,
We start <unk> the <unk> with the <unk> <unk> to the forest.
Or, in <unk> <unk>, are disease disease that are <unk> with the <unk> discovery of <unk>.
If we <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk>, where I'm doing a lot of research, you'll see the <unk> <unk> of the political <unk>.
As a <unk>, the <unk> physics of a <unk>, is <unk> at the <unk> level, but <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, not only is it, but <unk> <unk> in certain <unk>, because it's part of the development.
And you can't understand the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> until you're part of the beginning.
I've <unk> miles from <unk> in the <unk> China through the <unk> <unk>, <unk> to <unk> with a young <unk>, but only come to <unk> what's behind the <unk> I realized what's behind.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> million people <unk> from <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk>.
The father of this guy was <unk> to the <unk> <unk>.
So that's what it's been <unk> at the <unk> of the Chinese <unk>.
<unk> <unk> is <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> during the <unk> that he <unk> the <unk> in <unk>.
My mother was <unk> and his <unk> was to be <unk>.
It was taken to <unk> in <unk> at age two <unk> under his <unk> because he couldn't have to be <unk> without him.
The <unk>, who did the same, was <unk> in <unk>.
A day, <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> and, for this <unk>, was <unk> to the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> of <unk> can be <unk>, but the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk>.
And then it <unk>, everything <unk> to a choice.
Do we live in the <unk> world, or we want to <unk> the <unk> of the diversity?
The great <unk> <unk> <unk>, before he died said that his greatest fear was that it was that, in our go to this <unk> view of the world, not only <unk> the whole <unk> of the human imagination would be <unk> to a <unk> <unk> of thinking, but a day we <unk> us from a <unk> <unk> that there were other possibilities.
And it's <unk> to <unk> that our species is <unk> for <unk> years.
The <unk> <unk>, which has given us to agriculture, which <unk> us to the <unk> of <unk>, <unk> the <unk> of <unk> with the <unk> of <unk>, creating the <unk> of <unk>, and we're talking about <unk> years ago.
<unk> <unk> <unk>.
That <unk> story I don't think we have the answers to all the challenges that we could <unk> in <unk> to come.
When we <unk> these <unk> <unk> of the world is asked what it means to be human, <unk> with <unk> different <unk>.
And it's in these answers that we all <unk> the possibility of being what we are: a <unk> species, that has to make all the <unk> and all the <unk> can <unk>. And there are great moments of <unk>.
I <unk> this picture on the north of <unk> <unk>, when I went to <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk>, and this man, <unk> me the wonderful story of his <unk>.
The government <unk> has not always been <unk> with the <unk> <unk> and in the <unk> <unk> our <unk>, we <unk> them into <unk>.
The <unk> of this man is <unk>.
The family, <unk> for his life, <unk> <unk> all the <unk>, and all his <unk>.
You want to know that <unk> don't <unk> the cold, we'll <unk> it.
The <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> of this man didn't <unk> from the night <unk> or <unk> <unk>.
It's <unk> away, it <unk> the <unk> in the skin of <unk> and <unk> into your hand. When I did they <unk> it, he <unk> it <unk> it into a <unk>.
It's <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk> <unk> and when <unk> <unk> <unk>, he <unk> a dog.
He <unk> the dog and created a <unk>, with the <unk> <unk> <unk> created a <unk>, has <unk> another dog and it's <unk> on the <unk>, <unk> of <unk> in <unk>.
Do you want to talk to anything?
<unk> <unk> the <unk> government <unk> to the total of an area of <unk> <unk> of a larger <unk> of California and <unk> together.
It's their new <unk>. It's called <unk>.
It's a <unk> <unk>. It's <unk> all the <unk> resources.
One <unk> of how a <unk> can <unk> with his <unk>.
And, to end, I think it's quite <unk> at least at least at the people who's been in these <unk> <unk> in the planet, realized that they don't have any <unk>.
For somebody is home.
<unk> <unk> of human imagination that <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> of the time. And for all, the dreams of these children, as the dreams of <unk>.
And to end, we <unk> <unk>, we're <unk> that <unk> <unk>.
I think <unk> --
They're not <unk>, but we believe that stories can change the world, and maybe we're the best <unk> to tell the stories of the world. Every month our <unk> <unk> <unk> million <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> our <unk>.
Our <unk> are <unk> by millions of people.
Our work is <unk> in <unk> to <unk> to bring our public in places to <unk> <unk> from which <unk> <unk> from which <unk> <unk> from <unk> how they saw and <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, the <unk> world's <unk> in diversity, and we have to find a <unk> <unk> in a <unk> world. And we have to find a <unk> <unk> of life in a <unk> world.
where the <unk> of all the <unk> can <unk> to our <unk> <unk>.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some some things that I <unk> in this book that I hope to <unk> some <unk>, and you can't <unk> some <unk>,
I want to start with what I call "the <unk> <unk>."
Is the <unk> <unk> of what?
The <unk> <unk> of all the society <unk>. The <unk> <unk> <unk>: "If we want to <unk> the <unk> of our citizens" The way to do that is <unk> the <unk> <unk>. "
The reason is, on the one side, in fact that the freedom is itself a value, is <unk>, useful, <unk>, <unk> for humans.
<unk> else is in fact that if we're <unk>, every one of us can act to do all of us to do everything that <unk> our <unk>, without any that we're going to do this.
The way to <unk> the freedom is <unk> to <unk>.
<unk> more choices, they're <unk>, and more is their <unk>, and more the <unk> of their <unk>.
This is, <unk> <unk>, in the society that no one <unk> to <unk> in <unk>.
And it's also <unk> <unk> in our lives.
I'll show you some examples of what progress has made possible.
This is my <unk>. It's not particularly big.
I <unk> a simple note on the <unk> to <unk>.
In my <unk>, there are <unk> <unk>, without <unk> the 10 <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that no one of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> that no one of <unk> in the <unk> <unk> that no one of the <unk> already.
That's what <unk> is.
Then you go to the <unk> store to buy a <unk>: <unk>, <unk> <unk>, radio, <unk>, <unk>, radio, <unk>.
And in this single store, there's a big number of <unk> <unk>.
We can do six and <unk> of different <unk> using the <unk> that there are in just a store.
<unk> <unk> that there is <unk>.
<unk> fields: the world of <unk>.
Once, when I was a kid, you could get all the <unk> <unk>, to <unk> that they were <unk> by <unk> <unk>.
They <unk> the phone, you don't <unk> it.
And a <unk> of that, by the way, was that the phone was never <unk>.
These days they go.
We have a <unk> <unk> of <unk>, especially between phones.
Here's the cell phones.
My <unk> is in the middle, <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk>.
If you don't have seen it in the <unk> <unk>, you're going to be <unk> <unk>.
And what happens to the end of it is that people <unk> in <unk> and it's this question. And you know, the answer is, "No."
It's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn't make things.
So, in other <unk> of life that are much more important than <unk>, you get the same <unk> of choices.
<unk> <unk>: It doesn't happen in the United States that you're <unk> from <unk> and the <unk> you <unk> what you have to do.
Instead, <unk> by the <unk>, and the <unk> says, "OK, we could do it." or <unk> "A he" <unk> "<unk>" <unk> "<unk>" <unk> "has these <unk> and these <unk>. What do you want to do?"
You <unk> them, "<unk>, what do you want to do?"
And the <unk> says, "He's got these <unk> and these <unk>, and <unk> <unk> these <unk>."
"What do you want to do?"
And you would say, "<unk> if she was me, what would you like?"
And the <unk>, "I'm not her."
<unk> <unk> it makes it a <unk> <unk>, which makes it look like a nice thing.
But in fact, it's not that a <unk> the weight and the responsibility to make decisions from someone that, <unk> the <unk>, to <unk>, to <unk> that nothing knows anything -- and of course, is <unk> -- and it's certainly not in <unk> to make decisions about <unk>.
There's a huge <unk> of <unk> products, <unk> to people like me and you, if you think if you think about it is no sense, because we can't <unk>.
But if we can't <unk>, why do we <unk> them?
The answer is they want you to <unk> the <unk> to <unk> the <unk> to <unk> the <unk>.
<unk> so <unk> as a <unk> is our <unk> now is a matter of choice, how you see in this <unk>. "We don't want to <unk> kids. We don't want to <unk> the kids. We don't want to <unk>.
And we can <unk> how many times we <unk>.
That means that every <unk>, at the <unk>, you have to decide that kind of person.
<unk> to the family and the <unk>, a <unk> perspective, <unk> almost to anybody, was that there was the <unk> as soon as possible, and they <unk> to get kids as soon as possible.
The only real choice was with the people, not when, and even what to do after.
<unk>, it's really to play.
They're going to be very smart, and they <unk> the 20 percent <unk> than a time.
And not because they're less <unk>, not because they're less <unk>.
But why they're <unk>, we're going to <unk>, "<unk> <unk> or not?"
"<unk> <unk> <unk> later? I have to think before you get to think about kids or to the career?"
They're <unk> <unk>.
And they try to answer these questions, even if this <unk> doesn't <unk> the <unk> that they <unk> and not get a nice <unk> to my <unk>.
And they really need to do that. They're important questions.
Now, the work is we're <unk>, as <unk> <unk>, because the technology allows us to work every minute, every day, every day, every day, <unk> that from <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, there's a <unk>, and I won't tell anybody, where the <unk> works.
I'm not saying that because I want to use it.
What does it mean, this incredible freedom to <unk> that we have about the work? Is we need to decide, <unk> at any moment, if we have to work or not.
We can go to see our son to play <unk>, with the mobile phone in a <unk>, the <unk> into the <unk>, and the <unk>, <unk>.
And even if they're all <unk>, every minute we see our son will be <unk>, we're also <unk>, "I have to answer this called"? "
"I have to answer this? I have to <unk> this?"
And even when the answer is "no," it makes the experience of your <unk>, very different <unk> that what would have been in other conditions.
So, we look at all, little, look at all, small things, <unk> materials and <unk> life, life is a matter of choices.
Once the world was this: <unk>, there were some possibility, but it wasn't a matter of choice.
The world today we're going to be <unk> to this: "Is it a <unk> thing, or <unk>?"
The answer is <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> we know, we all know, so I'm going to talk about the <unk>.
We're going to be <unk> that one of the people who are <unk>.
The first one, <unk>, is that it <unk> instead of <unk>.
With a lot of <unk> between which you to choose, it's very difficult to do it.
So I'll give you an example of <unk>: a <unk> study on <unk> <unk>.
A <unk> my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> society <unk> <unk>, with about a million <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> different companies.
What she found is that for every 10 solutions that are <unk>, the <unk> of <unk> <unk> of two percent.
With 50 <unk> <unk>, there's 10 percent less than <unk> than when they're only available. Why?
Because with 50 <unk> between which you to choose, is <unk> difficult to decide, and the choice is <unk> to <unk>.
And <unk>, and yet <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and of course <unk>, <unk> never comes to.
<unk> that doesn't just mean that these <unk> <unk> <unk> food to <unk> because they don't have enough money, you want to say that the decision is so <unk> that we also <unk> the decision <unk> of work.
They don't know, they're <unk> to <unk> <unk> for year from work, that would be well <unk> to <unk>.
So <unk> is a <unk> of <unk> to have <unk> choices.
And I think we're going to be like this.
"And to end," <unk>, <unk>, <unk> or <unk>? "
You're going to be able to take the right decision, if it's for <unk>, right?
You don't want to choose the wrong wrong, and <unk> the wrong <unk>.
So this is the first effect. The second is that even if we can <unk> <unk> the <unk> and make a choice, at the end, we're less <unk> by the <unk> of how you've been <unk> with <unk> between which you to choose.
And that's why we're going to be <unk>.
One of these is that with a lot of <unk> between which you choose, if you take one and not perfect, it's easy to imagine that you could make a different choice that would be better. And what happens is that the <unk> <unk> <unk> us to <unk> the <unk> <unk> of the decision, and the <unk> <unk> <unk> from the decision,
even when it was a <unk> decision.
<unk> more choices there are, easier to <unk> any <unk> that is <unk> of the <unk> of <unk>.
<unk>, there's what <unk> call.
Dan <unk> has <unk> very well <unk> as the value that we give to things from what the <unk>.
<unk> rest, when you're <unk> a lot of <unk>, it's easy to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and being less than the <unk> that you are choice.
Here's an example. I <unk> with all of New York.
But that's what we will probably do.
There's this <unk> to the <unk>.
A place of <unk>.
<unk> <unk>. <unk> day. It's all for them.
It doesn't <unk> anything. But what he thinks is, "Well, <unk>, it's <unk>."
"All my <unk> <unk> are away."
"<unk> <unk> <unk> right in front of the house."
And it's going to go to two weeks from the idea that's going to be <unk>, where it wants.
The <unk> <unk> <unk> for what we have, even when the choice was <unk>.
And the more the <unk> we have from <unk>, the more the <unk> <unk> <unk> us.
Here's another example.
This <unk> tells us a lot of things.
It's about to live the moment, and maybe a living slowly.
But the most important point is that anything you want, you want to <unk> to do other.
The things that don't <unk> have a lot of <unk> that can make less <unk> what we do.
<unk> point: <unk> <unk> of <unk>.
I tried it on my skin <unk> a new couple of <unk>.
It's always <unk>.
Once the <unk> were just like, <unk> them and <unk> <unk>, were <unk>, only after <unk>, they were <unk>, only after <unk> a life and <unk> a lot of times, it would be good.
So, I went to <unk> a couple of a new <unk> when the <unk> were gone, and I said, "I need a couple of <unk>, this is my <unk>."
The <unk> said, "Do you want to <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>?"
Do you want them to <unk> or <unk>? "
"Do them want to <unk> it?"
"<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk>? <unk> <unk> <unk>." <unk> <unk>. "
I was <unk>, and after a little bit I could say, "I want the guy to -- that was the only guy that was, so for an hour. It was <unk> me all of <unk> <unk>, then I <unk> all of <unk> <unk>, then I <unk> it out of the store, <unk>, <unk> with the <unk>, I had the store.
It was <unk>. With all that choice I had <unk> the best.
But I'm going to get worse.
Why? I've written a book for <unk>.
The reason I was worse is that with all that choice my <unk> were <unk>, the <unk> <unk> to be <unk>.
I had <unk> <unk>. I didn't <unk> anything <unk> when I just had a guy, just a <unk>, like, but when I had to 100 different, it was a perfect guy.
What I had <unk> was good, but not perfect.
After I <unk> that I <unk> with what I was <unk> in <unk> to <unk>.
The <unk> of <unk> in life's life doesn't do <unk> that these <unk> <unk> than the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> themselves.
And this <unk> <unk>, even when the results are good.
<unk> in the world of <unk> if it <unk>.
Because if I <unk> it, I don't know what I'm talking about.
The truth will be more to that.
"It was better when you was worse than" The reason you're better when you're worse was when you're worse than the <unk> of <unk>.
<unk>, in the world where we live -- <unk> citizens with the <unk> of <unk> -- the <unk> that we can <unk> is that things are <unk> to be <unk>.
You've never <unk> <unk> <unk> because your <unk>, my <unk>, they're <unk>.
The <unk> of happiness -- what you're here -- is, "<unk> <unk> <unk>" Yes, "you want it."
I mean, little <unk> moment -- that I really <unk> and my wife is really <unk>.
I couldn't do better, I couldn't <unk>.
But <unk> doesn't always <unk>.
<unk>, a <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> when there's just that kind of <unk> is that when you're <unk>, and you say, "Why?"
"Who is <unk>?" The answer is <unk>.
The world is <unk>. What could do I do?
When you have hundreds of different <unk>, and you'll <unk> a <unk>, and you'll tell you who's the <unk>, it's clear that the <unk> you are.
You could do better.
With hundreds of <unk> <unk>, there are not <unk> for <unk>.
So when people make decisions, even if the result is <unk>, they're <unk> <unk> and give them <unk> to their own.
In the last few years, the <unk> is <unk> in the <unk> world.
I think a <unk> <unk> -- not the only important -- of this <unk> of <unk> is that people have <unk> experience because the standard are too <unk>.
And when they have to <unk> this situation they think that <unk> is them.
So the final result is that in general is that in general we're better, but we'll get worse.
Let me give you.
This is the <unk> <unk>, what we're going to take for it and it's completely <unk>. It's not true.
There's no <unk> that a little bit of choice is better than <unk> at all, but by this doesn't <unk> that much more of choice is better than a little bit.
There's a <unk> value, <unk>. I don't know what it is.
But I'm quite sure we've <unk> from a piece of the level that the choices are <unk> our life.
Now, from the <unk> <unk> -- I almost almost finished -- from the <unk> <unk>, the <unk> is <unk>.
What it allows all that choice to <unk> society is the <unk> material.
There are many places in the world, and you'll <unk> <unk>, where the problem is not that they have <unk>.
The problem is that they have too much <unk>.
So the <unk> I'm talking about is a <unk> <unk> of <unk>, <unk> society.
And what it does <unk> and <unk> is this: <unk> <unk> <unk> to you yesterday about how much those <unk> and <unk> <unk> to <unk> are <unk>. It's a <unk> of money.
I mean that these choices, <unk> and <unk>, it's not that just <unk>.
They're <unk> <unk>.
They do it worse.
If a little bit of what our society allows choice to be <unk> to the people who too much too few possibilities, it would not be their life to be <unk>, but also our.
That's what <unk> call.
A <unk> of the income is good at all -- not just to the poor -- because of this one in <unk> that we're <unk>.
And to <unk>, "<unk>, you can become everything you want to --
<unk>, people of culture, <unk>, "What's going to happen?"
"It's <unk> that you can't get anything in a <unk> of glass."
"A <unk> imagination, a <unk> view of the world --"
and I <unk> it so, at the beginning.
But then, I was <unk> that the <unk> knows that the fish knows the long.
Because the reality of fact is that if you <unk> in <unk> the <unk>, so that "everything is possible," you can't <unk> the freedom.
If you <unk> the <unk> so that it's all possible to <unk> the <unk>.
<unk> the <unk>, and you <unk> the <unk>.
Everybody needs a <unk>.
This is almost of course too <unk>, maybe even for the fish, and certainly for us.
But the <unk> of some <unk> <unk> is a <unk> for <unk> and, <unk>, for <unk>.
Thank you.
