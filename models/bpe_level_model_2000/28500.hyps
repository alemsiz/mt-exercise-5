The last year I showed these slide to show that the glacial glacial glacial glacial sizes of 48 million years had the United States 48 percent has restretent dimensions of 40 percent.
And yet this undervalue of the problem because it doesn't show it show the same.
The glacial glacial climate is in a certain sense, the climate climate system.
You expands of the wall, and you get right.
The next slide is going to be a rapid rapid on the last 25 years.
The ice lots of lots are signed in red red it.
As you see, you know, they expand the blue expanding up to the blue same.
That's the ice in the winter in the wall, which is the glacier.
You can see that the ight ilocation of the ight iaca's glacium of five years or more and more like the blood from the body.
In 25 years was spent from this -- this is a way of this.
This is a problem because the interests is that the earthly the earth, the arten around the ocean arctic amount of carbon floors, and they get floormicrobies.
Rempt to the totality of the atmospheric warming from global warming warming that amount could double, super-scale floor.
In some laghi laghi is already reboards the metan is already reboards on the water.
The professor, Katey Walter the University of Alaska has recated team rected with a team of based at the wall.
Wow! Al Gore: Wow! All right. The question is if we are going to be the
A reason is that this exchange is that this exchange the Greenland is the Greenland from the northermal Greenland from the northermal Greenland is that this exchange from the northermal Greenland is that this exchange from the northermal Greenland is that this exchange from the northermal Greenland is that this exchange from the northermal Greenl
This is a river.
The taken had never reached levels.
This is the Kangerlusaq, in the southern Greenland of the Greenland and the Greenland
If you want to know how the best level of the game, and the gathere, you know, it's where the sea level of the game.
These rents are increasing rapidly.
At the other part of the planet: Atart, the biggest block of the planet.
The last month, the scientists have declared that the balance of the ice, and that Antarctidental Antarctidental -- which is particularly running on the island of the submarine, is particularly rapid in the shef.
And the queen of the water of waters, like in Greenlevel of the water --
Himalaya, the third block of ice block of ice block, you see new laks, which few years ago were ice.
On 40 percent of the world's population is going to be recently released by the shot of the mondial population of the world's population of the world's population population of the world's population population of the world's population population from the short population of the world's population is going to be recently recover.
On Ande: This icer glacier is the source of this city.
The taken is increased.
But when you diminisease, the same thing happens to the water.
In California the neve Sierra Nevada is diminitty of 40 percent.
The idricultures are in crisis.
The predictions, as you have the lecture, they're gravs.
The growth is cities in the world door a remarkable increasings.
The environmental disasters are increasing a returns out of the normal and without previous precedenting it.
Four times more numbers in the last 30 years of respect to 75.
This is a sustainable of instainable.
If you look at the context, if you can see the consequences.
We have 70 million tons of the CO2 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the oceans every day.
Look at the point of the oriental Pacific Pacific America, and the west, and both the subject parts of the continent of Indian Indian Indian Indian the continent of the oceans.
The greater is global warming warming and the deforestation, which is 20 percent, is the use of the reef.
The oil is a problem, and the carbon is even worse and the carbon is even worse
The United States are one of the two countries with more emissions, together, together, together,
And they proponed to build a lot of other central central central carbon and fashion.
But we're seeing a change.
These are the annulled projects in the last few years and some green-greenalternative recent projects of greens.
At any way, there's a political lotly in our country.
The carbon industries and oil industries have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote clean and the carbon that is a oxymor.
This picture rericement me remind me --
Natmal Tennessee, where I live it, where I was a loss of 3.8 billion gap choories of chories.
Maybe you saw it on the news of the news of it.
This is the second biggest floors in America.
It's happened around Natmaks.
The natalizes of one of the carbon industries was this one.
Video: Man: Man. Frosty the carbon is a type and happy and happy.
It's abunding here in America, and it does economy.
Frosty the carbon is and more cleaner.
It's a good price, and the workers and the workers are kept the stick of it.
Al Gore: From here is a lot of the West Virginia.
The biggest society about the mountains is Massey Coal. This is his amminister.
Video: Don Blankenship: I'm going to be asking -- Al Gore, Nancy Pelosis, Harry Reid -- they don't know what they're talking about.
Al Gore: So the Alleance for the Proteam of Clima has two campaign of the Clima has two campaign
This is a one of it.
Video: All right. ALery see the climate changes like a minum of a climate changes as a service threaten.
So our priority is invest a great amount of money in a band of the audience, public effort and confuses the verity of the carbon and confuses the carbon on the carbon and confuses the carbon to make the carbon to make the
In fact, the carbon is not sport.
We think it's pulled -- it's a good profump.
So not predicous predictable.
Let me do you do it.
Video: All right, Carbon -- you heard about -- you heard a lot of it.
So let's do a turn around a structure to the absolute floor, and it turns out to the carbon and clean it.
Straordinary traordinary -- machines are a little noise, but this is the sound of the carbon technology.
The carbon is between the main of global warming causes of global warming, but the night technology of carbon that you see change.
She asked a look at the carbon technology of carbon technology
Al Gore: Finally, the positive alternative positive is connected to the economic and the national safetety.
Video: The America is climate crisi; the economy, the economy, the national climate climate crisis.
The move that colleges all of the phys: our dependence from the resiliable fossil fuels, and the important.
Now, there's a new audition for the new audition for it.
Lepower America. 1,000 percent of clean energy in 10 years.
They have a plan to put the America in work, make sure and helping us to stop the global warming.
Finally, a solution that bastic solution that you solve our problems.
Like a lot of more.
Al Gore: This is the ultimate one.
Video: It's about reducing energy to America.
One of the fastest ways to bring the dependence from the combustics that kills killing our planet.
Sop is here. The future is here. I sole, a new network -- a new energy network.
Soice of 2: Noves investment investment for the well-retribes to work well.
M: Repower America. It's time to be realists.
Al Gore: A proverbial African proverbial says, "If you want to go fast, you go to it.
If you want to go away, and you go back and look at it."
We have to go away, quickly.
Thank you very much.
The year last year at TED phect in the LHC.
And I promise to return out to go back to how machine.
So I got out here. And for those who are the other once there was no science experiment, the LHC is the greatest science ever ever tried -- 27 kilometers of circumstom.
Her comfortable is to reach the conditions that were less than a billion second from the universe -- until the universe -- until 600 million times a second.
And that's just the environment.
This is the Gineva.
We photographs these mini-Bang Bang Bang Big Bang Bang Big Bang Bang Big Bang Bang Big Bang Bang Big Bang Bang Big Bang Bang Big Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Big Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Big Bang Bang Big Bs.
This is what I work. It's called ATLAS -- it's 44 feet and has a 22 feet and has a 22 feet of feet --
This is an image spectacular image of ATLAS in building so you can see the proportions.
The 10 sectors of the last year we have access to the car for the first time.
And this picture was taken by ATLAS.
It was because of the immenses of the controls of it.
It's a picture of the first phase, which was done all the gyp of the LHC, entering the collision, and deliberately with a part of the LHC, and spreading particles.
In other words, when we see that pictures 10 secems the 10 settember that machine works, which is a great liftye.
I don't know if it was this to experience more or this when somebody went to Google and saw that the beginning was this one.
That means that we had a cultural impact of the cultural impact to the science of the science that scientific impact.
About a week later, it was a problem with the machine, and it had to these files here -- these sleeps sleeping the sleep.
These files take 13,000 print when the machine works in the machines of power.
Now, technics between you look at the movies and say, "It's not true. They're too much underly."
And they can do it because when they're very quickly telling the superconvictions of the superconvictors.
So, at less 271 degrees, a further temperature in the stars, these movies can bring that corrupt that corrup.
In one of the most of the most of the magnets in the LHC, there was a fabrication.
So the movie is climb and they were read and the 13,000 ample of suddenly meeting a resistence.
This was the result.
Now, this is more impressing if you think that these magnets fish tons are about 30 centimeters and that had been moved about 30 centimeters.
They have damage of a floors.
We had to take it down, what we did we do it.
We have repristine and further.
They're now returning all the way to their place under land.
Enth of the LHC is going to be new integrated integrated integrated intes.
We will access it to get us and we expect of the data or jug, and keep and keep the walls that we found out what the walls are the matts that constituent costs that constituent costs that constants that constants that constantly the universe.
Now, of course, in a certain four-way floor, these incident fashion value of science and engineering in frontiers. It's easy to conft.
I think that the fact that it is so difficult to go beyond the limits, I think it's the value of things like LHC.
I would like to conclude with the words of a scientist Ingless, Humphrey Davy, which is involved in the inuseful inuseful experiments of his pupllo was Michael Faray, he said, "No he's so dangerous for progress of the human mind is so dangerous, and science is not a true steries of the world."
Thank you.
I want to start to ask you to rethink about here, from kids, you know, you play with the kids, you play cool matter cooes.
As you understand how you reach them and reach them and relief them and move them and move it and resolve and solve problems and solve relationships and sending relationships and spot relationships and slightly degree relationships and sending the space and sunging relationships.
The space reason is prophones is deep a lot of the world around us.
So, by informer, inspired by using our interaction with physics of our interaction with physics, and my collaborator Jeevan Kalaniths, I started asking myself, I started asking mouse -- "And if you use a computers, instead of the mouse of the mouse as a mouse as a pastrecing information with both ent, physicistly a detect with both information with both information with both physically digital hands,
and we put it on our please?
The question was so interesting that we decided we decided we decided we would have the answer to the answer to the answer --
In poor, a Sift, a Sift, a little bit of a big purpose computer.
In poor, a Sift, a Sift, a little bit of a big purpose computer.
You can move it with the hand, they can see the movement in them, and they have a drugs and have a radio wireless.
But more physics, as physics, like matter matter and you can move just rewards.
Sift-side example, a new ecosystem of tools to manipulate the digital information.
And as we get more physics, and as we know of their movement, and the other, and as they get more physics, and as they get more physics, and as we can explore and the other half of the motion, we can explore and explore new stiles and interactions of interaction.
I'm going to start with some simple example.
This is a Sift-shared video slights, if you including it into a direction, the video -- if you can also including it back to the other side back.
These interactive riticians are consciousness of the others.
If they are interesting them in what they are interesting around it.
If they come circumstom, and they can agitate a little bit of it.
If they come circumstom, and they can agitate a little bit of it.
They also have their movement and inclination
We then realized that one of the interesting interaction was the power to use gestures on the data, for example, "Turban example.
In this case, we have three Siftconfigurated, as a seckets and I can use them to the color in the central central color, where they mix mix the mix of the color.
and I can use them to use it to the color in the central central central central central central central in the central central central central central of color in the central central central central same.
And if we can put it on the way, we can put a little bit of it.
These are beautiful of learning as a language, like the mathematics and games of logical and games where people can try and see the logical things to try and see the result.
Now I'm --
This is a Fibonacus, I do with a program of equations.
Here we have a word play that is half between Scarabeo and Boggle.
She received a letter in the house to every Siftable, Pratically, at every turn and the rock of every turn on every Siftable, and as you certain and he certain and controls on a ditionary.
And then after about 30 seconds remissing a new set of letting and new possibility to try to be able to try to provide it.
Thank you.
Here's the children came to the Middle Middle Lab, I did it and I spoke and I sent them and I spoke a video.
They are pleased a lot of it.
And one of the interesting things about this kind of application is that you don't have to have a lot of education.
You just have to say, "The Compones of words, and they know what to do.
Here's the other people who try to it.
This is our best bete, younger tester in the right.
It wanted to only get them to the cross;
They just were running for him.
Now, this is a application of a interactive cards.
We wanted to build a tool appreciation of the languages is Felix.
It can inserve new characters in the scene, setting the Siftly.
It can inserve new characters in the scene, setting the Siftly.
Here's a little bit of the sun --
Video: The only is source.
David Merrill: He has a treat the scene.
Video: The current tree.
Bel work!
So schooling the Sift-schools can interact the characters --
Video: Bau!
-- by by by inventing their story.
Video: Hoy!
DM: It's a story with final apeped, and it can decide how you get it.
DM: It's a story with final apeped, and it can decide how you get it.
Volice: I live it,
DM: The last example I have time to show you is a tool, realized to be a recently device, and exective and exective and exective music.
it's a tool, realized recently, to sample, and execk and music.
The Siftable here across southern sounds like base and bacteria.
Each one of these has four different variations, and you can choose what use.
You can also inserve these sounds in a sequence to coming or or please.
And modify it by touch a sound and a "sequence."
These are effects that you can control from living, like the reverse and the filter.
The attacks to a particular sound and then it would put it to add it.
And then there are the general effects as time and volumes, which are apply to the entire sequence.
We look at how it works.
Video: DM: We're going to start a base in two Sift," we put a basic sequence, we system, we put it into a series, we add other base.
Now I put a bassy line.
Video: DM: Oh h to the top of the --
Video: And I'm going to put the movie on the bacteria, so I can control the effect from live.
Video: I can quickly like to quickly inclining the entire sequencing time from one side or the other.
Video: Something is now I'm going to add the movie to give more expression.
Video: I can recombine the sequence of the sequence of the volo."
So I didn't have to plan it before, but I can try and make it longer to make it longer or more guring or more source.
And now, finally, I can get the entire sequence the entire sequence in the left to the size of the "volume."
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is building new interface that men machine and more looks like our brain and more look like our brain and cord.
And today, I had time to show you one of the results of this perfect and even some possibility that we try to bring out of the lab of the lab.
The concept I want to transmit you is coming this new generation of objects to interact with digital media that will bring information in our world that we want.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the time to talk to all of you.
They're a write writer.
Soring books is my professional profession, but it's more than that, of course,
It's also the love and the fascination of my life.
And I don't expect that it can change
But I said, something particular happened to be success recently in my life and my career and my career to realibrate the entire recalibrate the entire recalibring me with this work.
The particular thing is that I recently wrote this book, this biography called "Mangia, Ama." And so different from my libri, for some reason for for some reason for some excent reason for for some excent reason -- and he became a little bit of interactional reasons.
And the result is that everywhere from now, the people are treating me as if I convicted to me as if I convicted it.
By -- convict; convict!
They come from me and say, "You don't have to be concerned and they said, "You don't have fear more to do better?
You don't have to keep writing to write all of life without any longer to create a book, that can important somebody can importing somebody can importing somebody can importing somebody to importing somebody who can importing somebody to importing a book,
that can important somebody can importing somebody that can importing somebody that can important?"
It's a reassicurant, you know.
But it may go worse as I remember that I remember 20 years ago, when I started to say to people -- I was a adolescent -- I wanted to be a trice.
I was going to go back to the same reaction.
And people said, "Don't do you know, I can't do it?
You don't fear that the humiliation of the killers killed you kill you?
You don't have to do this wall, and you know, life without any life that was going to come and die and die to die and die to die of a shot of same, with the mouth of falt cenergy fliment?"
You know, you know.
The answer -- the briefy answer to all of these questions is, "Sy."
I fear of all of those things.
I always had fear.
And I also have a lot of other things that people may not have to ine.
As a high-and other things things --
But, as I think about that I was thinking and I was asking me to ultimously because why is?
Is it it ration?
It's logic, who everybody debt to be expected by a work that you feel that you feel like to do.
But what is so particular is that we can make us creative to make us look at the mind of the mental health of the mental health of the mental way that other career doesn't make not do?
As my father, for example, he was a chemical engineer and I don't remember one time in his 40 years of activity in which he was asked if he was to walked if he had to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer if he was going to be further than the further of the mother, for example, he was a chemical engineer if
There was never -- that the John, John, how do you do it?
It didn't work like this, it doesn't it?
Onestly, the engineers as group as group of the centuries, they have no secods, bad, badged maniacs.
We writer, we have enough this reputation, and not only writers but creative of all of generes, we have this reputation of all of the general reputation of ally.
And it's not rest that look at the bottom of the magnituation of magnituation today, the creative of the magnitude, they have young and often for the hand.
And the ones that they don't have suicide seem to be actually displayed by their woms.
Norman Mailer, before in the last interview said, "Ogni my book, my book, he killed me a little bit more." One extraordinary recording about the work of their life.
But we don't have the way we feel that because we heard these things so much that we can actually be able things that we can actually interiority, and the notion that creativity and suffering the notion and the art, and the art, and the end, and the end, and it will always drive to the anguy in the anguguy and it will always get to the anguy in the angood.
And the question I want to ask all of this is -- are you going to agree with this idea?
It goes this -- because it looks like -- because it looks from a centimeter of distance to me not good for anything this supposion.
I think it's hodid.
And I think it's even dangerous, and I don't want to see perpetuated.
I think it's better to encourage our big minds creative minds of them.
And I know that in my case -- in my case -- it would be very dangerous to start out to that I feel like I heard of the circumstances that I had a career.
Of course, this is a young young people are pretty young and I have about 40 years.
I still have about four decade in me.
And it's very likely anything to write that any thing I'm going to be right from the world as the work that used by the world as the work that was going to be right after the last book.
I'm going to be slaved because we're all more or less friends here -- it's likely to be that my biggest success is to my best success is to my own own own shoulder.
Oh, Gesus, that think!
You know, this is the kind of thinking that brings a person to start to begin to start to drive gin the mornning. I don't want to do it.
I would keep it to do this work that we are.
So, the question becomes it?
And so I seed it to me after a lot of working to keep writing to continue to write is to create a psychological psychological psychological psychological psychology, ok?
I have to find a way to find a distance of security between me, that I'm writing and my natural reaction that the reaction of the reaction of the reaction of the way I started to look through the time, trying to find out of how to do it through time, trying to find out of the other society to see if they could have the better ideas and healthy and healthcare and healthy and healthy healthy and healthcare and healthy and healthy
how to help people creative people to manage inerent inherents of creativity.
And that research left me to the ancient Grecia and Roma.
You seguitems because it turns out to go back and then back back back back and then back.
In the ancient Grecia and the ancient Rome -- people don't seem to believe that creativity came from men from men and OK?
It was thinking the creativity was this spirit of the divine and that came to a few surface and unknown and unknown and unknown for distant reasons and unknown away.
The Greeks called these divines of creativity of creativity "demoney
Socrrrule, wonderful of having a demon that elargive wisdom and wisdom from long.
Rans were the same idea, but they called the kind of spirit without a genius.
which is great because the Romans didn't think that a genius really thought that a genius.
They resive that a genius, this kind of divine that he was created in the walls of the study of a study of a artist, a little bit like Dobby, and that was out of hiddeby, and that was out of hidden the job and modeling the outside of the result of that work.
Excitial -- etic, that is the distance of which is the psychological psychological that protects you from your work.
And everybody knew that was so that he was so that it works, right?
So the antic artists were protected by certain things, like the too narcissm, and what?
If your work was exceptional powerful you could not take all the market, everybody knows that you were helped by this genius.
If your work failure, it was not all of your failure, right?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be a incapable of incapable of being a inable of incapable of it.
And so the people handed the creativity in Occident for a long time.
And then the Rinascise Rinascise and all of this idea; we put the human being in the center of the universe and the mysteries and no longer and no longer and no longer and no longer and without left by divinity.
This was the principle of the rational humanity and people started to think that creativity came completely from the ively ished.
And for the first time in history, you start to refer this or around, or that artist as a rather than a genius.
And I have to tell you, I think it was a big error.
I think that allow somebody to believe a simple person to believe that it's like a recipe and the amount of all of my mysteries and fourselves is a responsibility to creative fragile and hers is a film that we have a film that we have a film that human fragile to ft.
It's like to ask somebody to engineer the sun.
Deform and distores the ego and creates all of these ingestilive expectations on performance.
And I think it was this pressure at the drive artists in the pasts of the past 500 years.
And if this is true, and I think that is, and I think, and now?
Can we can do it different?
Maybe I look at a more ancient understanding the ancient of the relationship between humans and mystery of the relationship between humans and mystery of the relationship between the human understanding of the reality.
Or maybe no.
Maybe we can't cancer 500 years of ractional thinking about a rational talk.
And there is probably people in the audience that would be suspects on the notion of the science that following people on the notion of the notion of their projects.
I probably not convince you all about this thing.
But the question I want to ask is -- why is it?
Why don't you think it in this way?
Because it has more sense than any other thing that has ever heard to explain the exasperant impredictionbility of creative process.
A process of process that has ever ever ever tried to do something -- therefore, all of here -- yet, you don't get rationally, you don't get rationally,
And, in fact, it can seem completely paranormal paranormal
I did this meeting against extraordinary Ruth Stone, which has 90 years old, but that was a poet, but that was a poet, and he said that during his childhood in the rural Virginia, working out in the rocket, and I heard it out in the wall, and I was going to be the exploded from the landscape.
He said it was like a further, it was like a further.
And he came roll to roll up to the landscape of the landscape.
You know, it turns out to get the earth under the earth under his feet.
He knew what to do to do to that point and it was talking about it, and he said, "Look like a morn."
And it turns out to the home and it was following this poetry and it should be going to take a little bit of paper and a pretty piece of paper and a pretty fastic southern and fastic further, and he would give it on the page.
Other times couldn't be enough fastonished and correction and corrective and corrective it and the poetry rocketry through and the poetry rockets and she would continue to roll through the landscape of the landscape of the landscape and he would continue to roll "Another poet."
Then there were the time -- this piece doesn't forget the piece of the time -- there were the moments that was almost losing losing allowing almost losing --
So, he was running to the home and was trying to stop and the poetry was going through and slide and the poetry was a bad in the past, and then he said, he was like it was like if you get away with the other hand and the Everybody and the Earth and the off.
He was a poetry from the coda and the reputs and it was the rope and the transancent on the page.
And in these cases, the poetry would be presented on the perfect page and intacross the last word to the first major against the ear.
So when I heard you -- it's crazy, it's exactly the same creative to my creative process.
Not all my creative process -- I'm not a convict!
I'm a mule, and my work is to work with it is to see me at the same horary every day and southern and sweet.
But even I was a little bit of the kned, I sliped against that thing, at times.
And I image that many of you also have the han fact.
You know, if the work and ideas and ideas and ideas I would have a certain funny source.
And what is this thing?
And how can we relate to that it doesn't have the head, but it will make us head, but it makes us remains sani?
And as I reck it to me the best example I have the musician I have the musician I interview that I interview years ago for a day.
We were talking about this, and you know, Tom, and you know, Tom, the major part of the person of the artist of the cleaner, and trying to control, and dominate these species of creative impulses of creative impulses of creative impulses.
But then he was hot and he was driving up on a day and a day he was driving on the highway to Los Angeles, he changed all for him.
He was going to go fast, and all of a track track of a lodia, which comes into his head, and elusive and elusive and elusive and the wall, you know, it's wonderful, and you know, wonderful and you know, it's wonderful to take it.
It has no piece of paper is not a mathemity, it has no register.
So it begins to feel this kind of old old old old old old that you can grow up in him, and I will remarry with this song as well.
I'm not good enough and I can't do it do it."
And instead of going to stop in the panic stop.
I'm going to put the whole mental process and did something completely new thing.
Look at the sky and said, "Sore, you know, I'm not seeing that I'm driving that I'm driving do?"
"You seem that it could write a song what?
If you really want to exist, you go back to a little more opportunity when I can take care of you.
One of course, you get to the other other other today.
You go to the wall, Leonard Cohen."
And his worked on this process changed after this.
Not the work, the work was still as the time.
But the process, and the fish anks that was released when the genius, the genius, the genius, the genius, and the genius, and the geniusing it back to the other thing that issues and realizing it was a whole thing that it had to be a whole thing of interiority.
but it was this piece of bizarre collaboration a conversation between Tom and the external conversation between Tom and external thing that was not Tom.
So I felt that story to change a little bit as I was working and save me a little bit of a time.
This idea, saving me when I was writing "Mangia, Prega, Ama," and falls in one of those disperation of the disperation in which we fall, and we couldn't get to think that will be a disaster that that will be a disaster book, which is going to be the worst book.
Not only bad the worst book.
And I started to think of this project.
But then I remember Tom who talked to the air and try to it.
So I was a high-corner on the manufacturing my comments to a nice gap of the room.
And I said, "You know, both you know, both the thing, both we know that if this book doesn't be brilliant not going to be brilliant not going to be brilliant not be chole, right?
Because as I see I am going to put all of that.
So if you want it to be better and do your party.
Okay, if you don't do it, I don't know about it.
I'm going to write the same because my work.
And I want to favor that was recorded that I today today, I presented to me to do my own own part, is there, OK, and it's like there, in the North Africa in the North people raduned for the dance of the Sacred and music, and music, and music, and the hours that they were going to go hours and the high to the high hours and the hours and the high-hours and the high of the floor, and the hours of the North Africa, and so I have
And they were always magnificent because the ballers were professionists and they were fantastic.
But every single time, rary, something happened, and one of these artists become tran.
And I know what I know is, I know what I know is, I know that you saw it all of the point, a performance like this.
It was as if the time stopped and the ballery walking through a kind of lands and walking through a kind of level and not a different than the sun, but all of them would involved it.
And suddenly not appears just like a human one.
But you access to the diline and under the divinity of divinity.
And when this happened, the time that was the time, you know what he was, they knew what they call it his name.
They were going to sing hands and and they started to singing, "Ah, Dod God, God, God, God,
That's God, you know.
Spack name -- when the Morors the Mors of Spana, they took this habits and pronunced with their pronounced in the century of "Allah, Allah, Allah, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, who's flew in the corride or flow,
In Spana, when a artist did something impossible and magic -- "Ah, oh, oh, oh, be, bad, and I mean, and I -- a little bit of a floor, and then I found -- a foot of God.
And it's great because we need.
But, the problem comes the day down, the ballery is when you wake up and discovers that are the 11 of Martedge and the God is 11 of the Martedge of God is not more.
It's just a mortal death with the game, and maybe it will never be able to him to the higher at that altheist.
And maybe no one dog, the name of God as you go, and what it has to do with the rest of his life?
It's difficult.
This is one of the most painful reconciliations to make a creative life in a creative life.
But maybe it doesn't have to be so angoody if you can not believe it, and it doesn't believe it, and the most extraordinary expects of your being come from you to you,
But believe it is just that you come from a squist that you have to get from a squisite part of your life that you have to go to somebody else when you find.
And, you know, if we think of it change.
And so I started thinking about it, and it's sure as I thought of it for several months during the book of book that public book -- I will have a dangerous, dangerous, dangerous charge of my big death of my big death of my big death of my big book.
And what I have to keep on the way I feel electricrized by this is, I don't fear.
Don't be going to be the work.
He talks about your parts, for your parts, any of your parts, any one can be.
If your work is ball, ball, ball,
If the dive, I think, you know, as a drive text of a wonderful time through your effort for a moment through your efforts through your efforts and then "Ole!"
One of the same dance your dance.
And "Ole!" to you, you know.
I think I think you have to teach it.
"Ole!" to you, even though you know, for you'd have a human and text tremendous talks to do you to present.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
As you know I've been talking about some of these projects on the human genome on the human genome of new genes.
We're now starting a new lost of biology and now we started to digitalize biology and now to start from that code and now now now we are swing into a new fashion, designing and synthetic and synthetic sintetic and synthetic sintetic code and synthetic and now to start a new fashion.
We always tried to take a big questions.
"What is the life life is something that many biology I think of a biology to understand a levels.
We tried to be approach, reducing it to the minimum minimum --
We're digitalizing from almost 20 years hours.
When we sequenced the genome of the genome of the biology of the biology to the digital world.
We now ask us to regenerate the life, or create new life from this digital universe from this digital universe
This is the map of a small organism, the Mycoplasma genitalium, which is the smallest species between those who can autoreplicating in the lab.
And we tried to reduce the genome to create a little bit smaller one even smaller one even smaller.
We are able to eliminate a hundred genes of the about 500 that are here.
But when we look at his metabolic map of metabolic map of the metabolic respect to the now.
Sredeed, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can helimind, one to the time, it's very unlikely that this can bring to a live.
So we decided that the only way to progress to be synthesize this chromosomes in a way to be able to modify and defying some of these fundamental questions.
And so we started the wind of "We can synthetic cromother?"
It can the chemistry of protecting these big molecules that we never could create before that?
And in case of course, we can do a cromos?
A chemical-mosome, it's just a chemical piece of inert.
The speed with which we are able to digitalize life is growing up to exponential exponential speed.
Our capacity to write the genetic code of it, rather degree disappear.
And our more recently recently recently the bring up to a exponential curve.
We started 15 years ago.
The process has request to a lot of the past review review before the first experiments.
But we found that synthesize DNA is very difficult.
There are thousands of cars in the world that are producing small segments of DNA, of the longer and it's a degenerative process and it's a degenerative process -- the longer is the longer and it's a degenerative decades, and there are it.
So we had to develop a new metodd to assembling these framments and correct the middle and correct the errors.
And this was our first attempt to the digital information of the genome of Phi X 174.
It's a little viruses that kill batter.
We designed the fragments, effect of the errors and I got a molecule.
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemical material and we put it into the bacteria and we put it into the bacteria have started read this genetic code and producing the viral particles.
The virals are then released by cells, they went back to cells, and they found the Ecovery; they found the Ecolyers.
I talked about recent recent industry was told by the way, they were told that they certainly comprehended to be this model.
They have more than you.
We believe that this is a situation where software can actually build his own hardware in a biological system.
But we wanted to do things larger in big.
We wanted to build the entire chromosome.
They're more than 58,000 lectures of genetic code.
So we thought we could build it in the size of virus, so that we could change the cassets to understand what the cassets are a living cell.
The projecation is crucial information and if we start with digital information in a computer, these have to be very accurated.
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 the accuratezation was a basic error, for every 10 miles a baside.
We found it, resequence, 30 errors. If we had that original sequence, we had that original sequence.
One part of the process is to design segments that are record to 50 letters that are remains with all the other segments of 50 letters to build underunit to build underunit together.
We roll elements here we can roll those until elements here.
You probably have read that we read that we inserve the crazy of the big.
Think of this is: We have a genetic code genetic code on four letter: A, C, GT.
Three of those letters code together about 20 lominoacid about 20 lominoacid for every lominoacid for every amminoacid for every amminoacid of the lects.
So we can use the genetic code to write words, frap thought.
What we did in the beginning was automobile it.
Some of the fact that it was not the poem.
We have designed these segments to simply unique segments.
There are games that repect and they put them and put them together.
And we started to assembling the parts, and seven the seven of seven my letter to seven the letter of 24 miles of the lectly led to their letter to get to 72 miles to get to 72 miles to get to 72 miles literally to 72 miles the letter.
We produced these dance dance dance sabundance and abundance -- so that we can sequence, we are trying to create a remarkable proceeding a residle robbut, and you will see in a minute.
We're trying to automatize the process.
So, this looks like the tabon a basket.
When we get to these very longments, much longer segments, more than 100 mile basive basic baside.
You get to the limits of the molecular tools of the molecular biology
So we have to look at other mechanisms.
We knew about another mechanism called "recombination of homology that in biology to rept the DNA to rept the DNA to rept the seats.
Here is an example.
This organism, called Deinococcus radiodurans, it can absorbing three million radiation rad rad radiation.
You can see in the southern square of the drogen selling distructed.
In 12 -- 24 hours is reassembled exactly as it was before.
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do it.
These organisms can set completely set of it.
They can live under it.
They're absolutely certain life exists in space, and you move to find new environments of water.
NASA has shown that this is shown that this view of the aven.
This is a picture of the molecule that we built using these process, just using the board, and using the lievidence of inserious segments.
The lievid lievil.
This is not been taken with a microscope microscope with a microscope rule.
It's a very big molecule, so that we can see it with a microscope with a microscope of it.
These are pictures that covered a period of about six seconds.
This is the publishing that we did a little time ago.
They're more than 58,000 letting genetic code code.
It's the biggest molecules ever created by the way, of the major machine.
It has a fish molecular fissuperior 300 million.
If we were going to spend 10 caratter with a 10 carattent, they would just take 142 pages to just trane this genetic code.
Now, how do we do it work? How can we active,
Obviously, you can tram, is a girls.
It's a little bit more complicated when you use batters.
It's more simpler than it is that it is a biller cells as our own -- you can just extract the nucleus and inserve the nucleus and put it on the clonation.
In the archaea archaea is integrated instead of the cell phone, but we recently demonstrated that we are able to do a complex trapiling a cromosome from a cromosome, and active it to another and active it.
We purifted a micromosomes from a microbial species.
The two are different as a tough men tough.
We have added some genes in a way that we could decide what choose, for this chromother.
The he's got the golding with the gass in a way to kill all the proteins.
And when we put it in the cells of the cellphone -- and you open our choicatos -- the new crumosomes is gone in the cell.
And we started to think we couldn't go beyond it, but we have a common to push us to him.
This is one of the oldest mechanisms of evolution.
We found that many species have added a second or a third or a third of a little cmosomes from a few hours of a thousands of new tratics.
So who thinks about evolutionary as a gene that modies has not understood that much of the biology has not understood that much of the biology.
There are of the gerisms called "restrion is that they found DNA.
The chromosomes that was in cell.
The cell phone -- the cromosomes that we put it on the ha.
You can see it and recognized the other chromosome, and it has the other hand, and we found it with only the cell and we recognized with only the cell.
it became blue because of the genes we put it.
And in a short of time, all the characteristics of a species are gone to the new species, and it turned of the new species, which we put it in the new species, which we put in the cell.
All the protein change, membranes are changed, and when we read the genetic code of equivalent equivalent to what we have transfer to what we have transfer to you.
Now, this may seem like genetic altering genetic software software -- we can change the things in a pretty sustain.
Now, I explain that you don't talk about gene -- but it was progress from three million years from three million years and a half evolution, and I said that maybe we're doing a new version of the Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosion of this digital explosion of this digital process of digital displayed that digital process of the genese.
Why do I want to do that?
I think it's enough obvious when we think about our necessity.
We're going to spend six billion and a half billion people in the next 40 billion years.
I am to give you a example: I was born in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for each other existing existing existing in 40 years, there are going to be four or or 40 years, there are three to be four year.
We're doing problems now now to find food, water and clean water and clean and clean bas, and drugs for six billion people.
It will be more during the billion to do it for nine billion.
We can get more than five billion carbon carbon carbon of olds.
It means a hundred million bariles a day.
When we try to find biological processes, or any kind of processing to replace to replace and replace to replace and a huge challenge.
We have to keep it to the CO2 emission of CO2 emission emissions that finishing in the atmosphere.
At day, thanks today, thank to the scientific discoveries around the world, we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I like to think that are the design components for the future.
The electronic industry has only a dozen dozen of components, and think about how many different things are coming out.
Our limits here are data by biological reality and our imagination.
We now have the techniques, thanks to these synthetic metods of synthetic synthetic methods that we call genomics.
We are able to build a big robots that can produce a million chromosomes a million chromosomes a day.
Think of a processing these 20 million different genes or to get the processing processing to make the processing processing to make it basive be, we can change a little team, and create biology and create biology and create biology and create biology in the last 20 years of science.
And it's just a standard.
We can chemicals to survivors, chemistry of survivors, chemistry or carbon and and vaccines of vaccines --
This is an instant instant, some software programmed on that we're working to be able to seeing the species and designing species in the computer.
Well, we don't know necessarily as they will be not.
We know exactly what their genetic code.
We're now focusing on the walls of four generation.
You also saw you to experiment, from the grand eetanol was an experiment.
We have a second lots of second and third generation that will come up pretty much higher dall, as the higher burons like the types of butanol.
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without increase major major food and limiting the coast of food and limiting the CO2 in material -- which we're working to design cells that we are working to design cells that can reach cells that can reach cells that can reach out this discover, and we could have the primate carbon generation in about 18 months.
The solar light.
This is a organism that we described in 1996.
It lives in the ocean deep deep about 2,500 feet of the water.
It rect the CO2 using molecular energy as a source of energy as a source of energy.
We're trying to figure if we can insonate CO2 -- which can easily be transported through your carbon -- and convert that CO2 in carbon to drive this process.
So we think that short we could have to increase what the basic question, which is the basic question, which is Noe, truth, and we have the modest otive biobic industry.
Exactly. If you can't do it from TED, where can you do that?
It would become a major source of energy.
And then we're working for using the same metods to create vaccines.
You saw this year with influence, we're going back to a year and a dollar, and a dollar, and you find the buck of it.
I think that that this can change building vaccines in the ancient way.
So this is how the future could start to change it, it looks like change, now, the tree of evolution, acceldering evolution, and synthetics, and indeed, and indeed, and indeed, and indeed, and indeed, and indeed, and the bird cells.
We are so much to improve people.
Our purpose is to make enough to try to make it very much to try to do it. Thank you very much.
First of all I will do you see the most possible work that we can see the Microsoft in the new technology that we've got to Microsoft in a water -- it's Seadragon. This is Seadragon. This is Seadragon.
It's a environment where you can interact is a local level that remote with a huge amount of visual data from visual data --
So we're seeing a lot of gabyte pictures of digital photo a kind of a zoom and continue, to a speed of lock fast.
And it doesn't matter how big information we see that we see it, as big as we see as big as well as big as wells or images.
Most of them are digital photographs but this for example, it's a scansion from the Bilibrary of Congressss, and reents res in the game.
It does any difference because the only thing that limiting the only thing that limits the number of place in your shot on your screen in any time. It's also an architecture. It's also a very flic.
This is a book, you know, the data data data doesn't images.
This is the Casa desolated Dickens. Every colonna represents a capitol.
So to show you that it's about text and not images, we can do something like that, to make something like to see that it's a real realm of the text, not a realm of text, not a photo.
It could be a little bit a little bit artificial book.
You don't look at it.
This is a more realistic example of the Guardian example of the Guardian example of the Guardian example of the Guardian example of the Guardian example of the The Guardian example of the The Guardian example of the Guardian examp.
Each image is the beginning of a section.
And it gives you the pleasure and the beautiful experience of read version of a view or a quotidness of a quotidner or of a very theily of a very theplices.
We also did something with the corner of this particular number of of the Guardian --
We created a high-resolution fashion -- much higher than what you use in a normal published -- and we put you in a normal authorically.
If you want to see the characteristics of this cars of the cars of this cars
Or other models, or even the specific specific specifics.
And this really demonstrates some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of the space on the screen.
We hope that means to put pop the pop and other similar, and we don't have to be necessarily to be necessary.
Of course, the map of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology.
And I don't want to lose time, if you don't want to lose that we have contributes to give it into this field.
These are all the streets in the U.S. obstery image of NASA.
So now we now now now now we spend something else.
This is actually from the webs; you can go to the webs; you can go and see it.
It's a project called Photosynth, which is two different technologies.
One is Seadragon and the other is a very interesting research, a very interesting research of the Washington, with the University of Washington, with the aid of the Washington, with the Heliski and Rick Szeliski Resear. Seliski Resear. Seadragon to the Washington, and the other works.
And it's from Seadragonon the web, gest, gestimate from Seadragonon.
You can see it when we do this kind of screen that we can spend from one picture to the other kind of resolution to the other kind of solution resolution to multiple.
But the space collocaation of the images here has actually actually meaningful.
The algorithms of visualization has recorded these images together, so that they correspond to the real slide-strokers in which the real slides -- all the neighborhood on the Montags -- were taken on the canadies -- were taken up. Here you see elements of a slidestable spite of space.
I don't know if I have time to show you some other environment.
There are a lot more space space.
I want to go directly to one of the original data set of the original data from a previous prototynth that we did work for the first time you have done to work for the first time -- to show you what I think I would show you what I think I will show you what the key is really the key to the clear environments that we put in the website.
We had to worry about legal way.
This is a rebuilding in Notre Dames pictures made from Flickr. Basta digitate Dame in Flickr. Basta Top of the types in the floor, and the camps and views and vident camps and view -- and vident is discovering a model.
So they're all pictures if Flickr and were all connected to the space in this way.
And it's possible to navigate in this simple way.
You know, I would never think I would never think of it to work for Microsoft.
It's very gratifying this kind of receive here.
I think you can see that it's a lot of different kinds of different kinds of fun fun of the phones of the phones to the phones in the environment.
And if I can try to look for those strange the strange of it.
Many are block from does, etc.
On a few part here is a series of photographs -- etch of photographs --
This is a Notre poster of Notre Dam's correctly recorded
We can spend from the physics of the physics of this environment.
The essential point is that we can do things with the social environment. This is now taking from all of the memory of how we appears the view -- and the view of view -- and it connects together.
All those pictures become connected together, and the sum of the same.
You have a model of the earth that emerge.
Think of this as a move of Stephen Lawler on Earth
It's something that grows in complexity as people use. And the people that use.
Their pictures are meeting with other people.
If somebody is the idea of contrast all these spreading out of the name of Notre Damames of Notre Damdams of all those data, and I can use all those data, and I can use as a point of the engineer to immergs in the space in that universe, in that universe, in that universe, using the photo anybody else and a skype of the skuser.
Of course, a consequence of all of the interesting virtual models of every interesting part of the earth, and the plane satellite and satellite and satellite images and satellitarian and similar, but by the memorie.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: What is I understand what your software going to conflict us to do is that at a certain years, all the photographs shared by anyone in the world, will be practically connected with who's shared together?
BA: Yeah. That's what it's doing is doing is discoveries.
He's creating hyperlins, if you want to be in the images.
And it's doing it in the base of the images.
The thing becomes very interesting if you think of the information of the seeds of information that many of these images can education of these images can education of these images.
As when you do a research of images on the web, and the head on the web has a lot of information about the pictures of the photos.
Now, what happens if that picture is a picture connected to all your photos you know?
So the amount of interconnection, and the amount of the amount of the recychance that is really huge effect of the rete. It's a classic effect.
CA: Blaise, it's really incredible.
BA: I thank you very much.
One of the main of the main of the main research and the research of the etnographics is the power between who has no dimentically forget the anti-traditions, between the wind of the wind of the plants in the wind of the plants of plants and lots of the plants.
You know, the amanks Jaguar is still beyond the Via ia ia is the Lattea, or the Milky Inuit are still covers of meaning or that in Himalay; the respiring of the anthropoloy is following the importance of the anthropoloy of the anthropoloy of the anthropoloy is just a model of reality, but it's only a model of reality, but it's just a model of reality,
the consequence of a particular choices that our irps that our irps has done that, well or bad, a lot of generations ago.
And, of course, we all share of essential tratics.
We all all of it. All right. We all procreise
We are dream objects to the beginning.
We have to deal the inexorability to death, so it doesn't take us to sources and balliam, and balliam.
We all have an art.
What it is the broad, the type of the dog, the rhythm's dance of every culture.
It doesn't matter that they are the Caran's forests of the Borneo, or the Haiti, or the Haiti, or the Creeas, or the Creeas, the Cursut in Kenya settlya settered in the heart of the Sahara.
He was my journey of the journey in the desert of yaks in the walls of yaks in the valleers of the Everest, the mother of the Everest, the demother of the world.
All of these people teaching us that there are other ways to existing other ways to think about other ways to think, other ways to think about other ways of thinking, other ways of making in the world.
And if you can give a moment, it's a concept that can give you hope.
Aside, my cultures of cultures create a raise of spiritual life and cultural and cultural cultural and cultural for the well-being of the planet so the biosphering biophfer.
And you can think of this rather cultural raising cultural as a ethnos; you can define the etnose of all the conceptive of all the conceptive and ideas, inspirations, inspirations, inspirations, inspirations, inspirations, instead of the consciouse.
The ethnos: The amazing patrimonurist.
It's the symbol of what we can have is as a species of what we can be as a species.
And because the biosphere was gravly consumed high-cost was a nice and the purtroubly.
No biology, for example, would say 50th percent of all the species has been or on the extinction of the extinction of the biological diversity -- in the most apocalitic, in the apocalitic, and you don't have a pool -- that is the most optimistic diversity.
The indication of all of this is, of course, the language.
When you're born born there were 6,000 languages on this planet.
One language is not just by a voice of a voice or a series of rules gram of gramph of the gramm.
One language is the crazy of human spirit spirit of human spirit spirit of human spirit spirit of human spirit spirit of human spirit spirit of human spirit spirit.
It's the means that the animation of every culture comes into the material in material world.
Every language is a forest of mind, a wine, a wine, a spiritual system.
And of those 6,000 languages, as we sat Monterey, at least half the half is not suspected in the ears of the kids.
They don't come more teached to the children, which means that you don't know, something like it doesn't change something, which are already to be dead.
What is more than the tristand is more than the silence, of being the last me to talk about a language of the day, the way to turn wisdom or to address?
This is a running state, is the state of somebody in some part of the world every two weeks a little bit of a walls and leads with session of a tomb.
And I know that somebody will tell "Isn't it better than this?
The world would not be a better place if we all talked about the same language?" Benish yoruba. We all all around the yoruba. We all have the same tex.
We talk about kogis.
Scover you will not talk about what it means you could not talk about their language.
And I would like to do a journey through the etnows --
a little journey in the etnise effort of what we're lost.
Many of us forget that when I say, "different different ways of existing exists of existing exists of exist.
We take this for example, this bimbe, Barasan Amazon is sector, the population of the anaconda, which creates of the anaconda, which creates of the best sacrivers of the sacride of the sacries.
It's a population of a population that it's not able to distinguid the blue color, because the elests is identify identify in the forest, from which is the popul.
They have a language and a language rule, and a mathematica," "English language, "Look a language.
And this has been the mythological roots in the past of mythological table, is that in these families that are talking about six or seven languages because of the marriages of the marriages that are tongue --
They listen to listen to and then they start talking.
We take one of the most interesting tribes that I lived with what I lived in the Waorans of Ecuador in 1958.
In 1957, five missionaries have tried to be a committed contact of a fact that
They did done from the high photographs that had been retents that were retent, dimentically returning that this population of the plug forest of the plug forest of the plug-dimensional forest.
They sent the photos from the ground, they gave the research of a shape or a figure -- they didn't get anything, they have been clude that it was the diavold, and they killed the diavold, and they killed the five mission with the lances.
But Waoran Woranese are not kill the strangers.
They kill it between them.
Five percent of mortality was because of their mortality was caused by their own own own own mortality was a five percent of mortality was a 40 percent of the mortality was because of their mortality was a five percent of the mortality was causing for their own own own own mortality.
We are risalitites to eight generations and we found two natural mort and when we insisted for knowledge that one of them was that one of them was that it died to have been so that it died the same. And then they killed it say.
The crums were able to recognize the animal from 40 steps and recognize the species.
In the early '80s, it was assigned a very interesting when my professor when my professor Harvard asked me if I wanted to go to Haiti to intrupholar with the power of Duvalier and the power of the Duvalier and TontMacoutes, and imposed to do zomes.
To give a sense of the miracle Vodoun’t have Vodoun’t have the black culture.
It's pretty much of a complex metaphysics of the world.
Many interesting.
If you ask me to tell you the great religions, what would would say, what would you would say, "What would you say?
Cristian, Buddddhy; Buddddhy;
One continent is always left out, and thinking that sub-Saharan Africa, and the sub-Saharan Africa, and the Voodoo is not that the distill, and the Voodoo doo deep concepts in the slavery of the slavery is the slavery of the slavery of the slave is that the slavery of the slavery is not that further.
What makes your interesting is is the intense of your life and death.
So you can see the spirits of the spirits.
You can be invested by the Great Aqua, they answer to the dance of dance and replace to the dance of the dance and sustiting to the animation of the way that for a short that for a short of the following the dio.
So your voodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodos.
We have to give the temple and we get God."
And from the moment you know, it's the spirit that you drive you, how can you do male?
So you see these incredible events are the following events of trance events that touch tizes inspiring skyets a pretty strong the body when it was catalyzed in a stage of extremely form in a state of extrement extrement of the brain in a stage of exciting extrement of the power events.
And all the people who lived with which I lived the most extraordinary Kogi Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, in the Santa Marta, in the sectonal Colombia is the Kogle
Scivilization of the ancient civilization that once they were going on on on the floor, the Colombia in the conquerous conquers, the people were going to be on the massive vulcanic planplankurs.
In a blood continent charge of blood from the spagnow.
At all of the today, but their own formation is decided, but their formation is decided.
The young people followed from the family and three or four years, and they live in a world of a good and they live in a world of floor, and they live in the glaciers for 18 years.

All cultures through the century have been involved in a dance for new possibility of life.
And the problem is not technology.

Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some things I wrote in this book that I hope to recall other and proverse and provide to the collegments, in case not known, in case not known.
I want to start with what I call "the offical."
The officer of what?
The dogm officer of all the Western industrial society is the west: "If we want to massive well-being of our citizing well-being of our citizing citizen."
The reason for the moon for a side, in fact, that freedom is in the same a value, is precious, useful for human beings.
On the other is that if we are free, each of us can act to do everything that massive to do everything that massive our beneat, without any one that decide in name.
The way to massimize freedom is to massimizing choice.
More people choices the people are liber, and most freedom is their freedom, and it's their freedom, and it's their benefits.
These are so deep in the society that nobody would dream of the society that nobody would dream of him.
And it's also deep in our lives.
I'm going to show you some examples of what the progress has possible.
This is my supermarket. It's not particularly large it.
I allow a simple note about conditions.
In my supermarket are 175 conditions, without contare the 10 variety of olive olive and 12 acets acets that you can buy to make a huge number of balsamic conditions, you can do a huge number of conditions, and the circumstance of 15 already already is your degreenhouse of your degree.
That's the supermarket.
Then you go to the snegotic sknee, and the CD, basic lectronic set, broke, pater, practice.
And in this single skettronic same, there's a big number of floors of audio of audio of the audio of electronic components
We can do six million different and a half million different combinations using the components that there are only a negotie.
You have to admit that there is a lot of choice.
Other camp: The world of communications.
Once time, when I was a kid, you could get all the service phones the phones that were wish, and the cleaners who were provided by mam.
He was read the phone, you didn't buy it out.
One consequence of that, in the way, was that the phone doesn't stop into the phone doesn't stop it.
These are the day.
We now have a variety of phones, especially between the phones cellphones, especially between the cellphones.
Here's the future.
My favorite is the basic bed MP3, the basic basic bulr.
If you don't have seen the hot of the house of the house of the house of it will be going to pretty much really.
And what happens is that people come into the negozes in the negozes and does this question. And you know what is the answ?
It's not possible to buy a cellphones that do not too much things.
So, in other aspects of life that are much more important than the waters, it is the same explosion.
Assistance of health is: The U.S. As you go from the doctor, and the doctor and the doctor of the doctor of what you have to do.
And then you go to the doctor, and the doctor, "Okay, we could do A, or B" "A, we could do this," "B" has these benefits and these risks. What do you want to do it?"
You say, "Dr, what would I do?"
And the doctor, "She has these risks, and the Gres and Bs these risks."
"What do you want to do it?"
And you rebat the point if she was to me, what would do?"
And the doctor, "But I'm not lead."
The result we call it the malato," expression that it does seems like a beautiful thing.
But in fact, it's not that one to move the fish, and the responsibility to take decisions from somebody knows somebody knows anything that it doesn't know -- and almost one else -- and so it's not -- and so in the ideal conditional to take the patient to take the patient to take the patient decisions to take the patient decisions that is the doctor.
There is a huge marketing of pharmaceutics, I direct to people like me and you, if you think it's not a sense, data that we can't buy it.
But if we can't buy it, because we public them and why do they public them?
The answer is that they want you doctor, we call the doctor, we call it the doctor.
Something that is our identity as our identity has been a question, and it's a little bit of choice, and you see in this view of the children. They'll not want to force. We will not be able to force. We have to investing a hydouble. We have to inve.
And we can reinventing us how many times we can get out of it.
which means that every morning, you have to decide that every morning, you have to decide that kind of person wants.
And I respect to the family and matrimony, and a lot of the common perspective, was that you could get the most pretty possible, and he was that you could get the most pretty possible, and he started the pretty possible.
The only true was choice was with choice, and not here, and what to do later.
Ogame, is really to play.
I mean, I think about a very smart, and I think about 20 percent in less of work respect to a time.
And because they don't do less because they're less diligents because they're less diligents.
but because I'm going to ask you, I mean to ask you, I said, "I should do it now?"
"I want to think about it later the tardi? I have to think before the kids or care?"
They're interrogative interrogative interrogative --
And they try to answer these questions, even if this imply doesn't completely completely to make a touch of your exame.
And they have to do it. They're important.
Now, the work: we're lucky as Carl subjects, because technology allows us to work every day, from every day, from every day, from the Hotel Randolphe.
Twentess, there's a corner, and I'm not going to tell anybody where, where the Wii Fi works.
I don't tell that, because I want to use it.
What meaning, this amazing freedom that we have to be choick at work? Is that we have to decide -- if we have to work or not.
We can go to see our boy kid play with the ball, with the mobile phone in the high, and the news in the high, and the news and the news of the eye and the eye --
And even though they're all pushes, every minutes that we see our boy boy, we are also asking the head, we are also asking this called ""I have to answer this called ""I have to answer this called "called a?"
"I have to put this email? I have to abboo?"
And even when the answer is "us, all this makes the experience of the walls of the walls of the walls that would be in other conditions.
So, from any part of them, things small and big things and big materials and big, materials and life, life is a question.
Once the world was this: Of course, there were some possibility, but it was not a choice.
The world today, is this thing thing is the positive thing to this is a positive thing, or negative negative or negative negative thing?"
The answer is Shyth.
The positive side of the negatives all of the negative sks.
All this choice is two negative effects on the people.
The first one, heavy, heavy is that produces instead of free paralysis of free.
With many options that choices that choices it becomes very difficult to do it.
I give you an example of an example of meant to the floors of volunteers.
One of my colleague had access to the data of the Vancertain society of though, with about a million clients of though, with about a million clients in 2,000 different companies.
What she found was that for every 10 solution is that for every 10 solution and more and more and more and more and more and more expercent.
With 50 sources is 10 percent in less than the 10th of adesions of when they have available only 5. Why?
Because with 50 sources between which choice, is malezed to decide and choice, and choices is remained to question.
And to question, and asking questions, questions, and of course, questions, and of course, questions and of course it wasn't going to be there.
You know, you know, these workers will not just food workers to food for cans because they don't have enough money, because they don't have enough money, which allow the decision is so ostick founds, which allows to work found the foundation of work.
They don't participand they are losing to 50,000 dollars per year from the work, that would be well going to be a verversial device.
So the paralysis is a consequence of the choice.
And I think it makes the world like this.
And for the ethernity: "The echeternity?
You would like to take the right decision, if it's for the eternity, right?
You don't want to choose the wrong found, and nep, the wrong.
So this is the first effect. The second is that even though we can avoid the paralysis and make a choice, we end up from the result of how we were we going to be able to be able to be able to less choices.
And this for a different reasons.
One of these is that with a lot of conditions, which is that you would have to be buy and whether you could have a little bit of a little bit different, which you could do a different choice. And that is going to be better than it would be better than that.
even when it was a great decision.
More choices us that, the more easy than anyone details anywhere detail, which is insodden of choice.
And there is what the economists are called the opportunity.
Dan Gilbert asks, very well stamack like the value that we have the value of things that we are confrontive to it.
On the time, you know, when you have a lot of possible options that are easy to represent the alternative careful and be less satisfacts of the options that you have choice.
Here's an example. I walk with all of the ones that are not in New York.
But it's what you probably think you probably think.
There's this copy to Hamptons.
A place of lus.
It is the splendid. Otypical day. It's all for them.
Nothing equivalent to the one is "Well, what he thinks is Augosto."
"All my neighbors in Manhattan are vie."
"I could talk to the case right to the home."
And it turns two weeks assilled by the idea that is losing -- every day -- the possibility of parking to the floor.
The expensive opportunity diminises the satisfaction for what we have, even when the choices was excellent.
And more are the options that we have to look at the most of characteristics will be returned against how expensive expensive expensive opportunity.
Here is another example.
This view tells us a lot of things.
It talks about the live moment, and maybe live slowly live to live slow.
But the most important point is that any thing you choices you choose you choose you chook.
The things that we don't choose, they can make less atter what we do.
Third point: spiral spiral spiral growing expectations.
I tried to my skin my skin a couple of jeans.
I will almost the jeans.
Once the jeans were just a type, and they were bought and the gestian and they were best, only after they bel, and they had a lot of times, they were beginning to go good.
So, I went to buy a couple new when the old ones were gone, and I said, "I need a couple of jeans, this is my cute."
The committed said, "You want you to slim fit, asy phitory flaed floor?"
You want to do you to the cernier or bottons "Stones? "Stones," or "acdy?
"Li wants a rocket?"
"You know, you want to get the blader or strettch, you know, the bla" -- he was a little blades.
I was swbe, and after a little bit I could say, "I want the only cheans -- that was the only typoth." It had no idea what I was the only one I tried to do all the diseases of jeans, and then the best jeans from the nego, and I was the best jeans that I had ever had.
It was the mas.
But I felt worst I heard it.
Why? I wrote a book that book to understand it.
The reason I was worse for that I was worse is that with all that choices were altissue were altising -- the jeans had to be perfect perfect for perfect and the jeans had to be perfect for the whole choice.
I had expectly. I didn't expected at the exceptional of exceptional -- but when you see a type, at least kind of a type of it was perfect.
What I had watered was good -- but not perfect.
After I was talking about the choices that choices I was trying to insuit to what I was insuit to it.
The add of options in life of people don't forward that these have respectative to excellence.
And this will produce less soddisft, even when the results are good --
Nobody in the world of marketing if you make it content.
Because if you know what I'm talking about, you would not know what I'm talking about.
The truth looks more like this.
"You was better when he was worse when he was worse when he was worse when he was worse when he was worse is that when it was worst was going to be able to meeting the surprising pleasant surprising pleasant surprising pleasant surprising pleasant to be able to be worst when you was worst
Ogame, in the world that we live -- opulents, industrialized citizens with the expectancy -- the massive that we can hope is that we can hope is that things are at the height.
You never have any surprising the previous amount of the expects, and miity, and they are ingigant, and injuggites.
The secret of happiness -- what you're here is -- "Baspect."
I mean, this little bit of -- this little bit of a -- which is really married and my wife is really amazing and my wife is really stuff --
I couldn't have any better, I didn't have any better, I don't have a further.
But I want to content is not always a bad thing.
And finally, a consequence of buying a couple of jeans whenever you have that kind of jeans is that when you're not satisfact, and you ask you "Why do you say, "Why do you know, "Why do you say, "Why is that when you're not southern the kind of satisface, "Why is you
"Who is responsible for the answer is clear.
The world is responsible for it. What could I do I do?
When there are hundreds of jeans, and you buy a little bit of a jeans, and ask you who is responsible, and you ask you who is responsible you are the responsible you're in your responsible you're there.
You could have a little bit better.
With hundreds of variety available, there are not to the insuccess.
So when people take decisions, even though the result is valize, they feel insatisface and they make the cope and they make the color to their own own own their own own own their own own own own own own their own own own their own own own own their own own copy to their own own own cope and they get the cope and they make
In the last years the depression is exploded in the industrialized world,
I think that a meaningful factor, but the important -- not the unique, but -- of this depression is that people have depression to be that people have deludge deludent because the standards are too him standards are too high.
And when they have to explain this situation thinking that the color is there.
So the final result is that in general -- we are better, and we feel el worse -- but we feel el worse
Let me leave you remember.
This is the offical, the offic, what we all take for good and it's completely fail.
There is no doubt that a little bit better than that I don't have a little bit better than that I don't have a lot of choices is better than a little bit better than a little bit of a little bit better than a bit.
There is a critical value value of it. I don't know what it is.
But I'm sure that we have been safe by a piece of the level where the best choices our life.
Now, from the political point of view -- I have almost -- I have been the following the nest point, the following the following point.
What it allows you to all this choice in the industrial society is the material of the industrial society is the material of the industrial society is the material of the industrial society is the material of the industrial society is the material choices.
There are many places in the world, and you know about it and you know that the problem is not that have too much choice.
The problem is that they too much cheat.
So the face that I'm talking about is a malesclusive to the modern, which is Western,
And what does it do is this depressing and arrabbing is this is: Steve Levitt depressing and seat the baby and seat bibirth of money.
I mean, this choices, complicated and dispendous, it's not that they simply useful.
They're addition deleteries.
They make it worse on the worst of it.
If a little bit of what our society allows a lot of choices was reververse in those where people have too much possible for possibility, it would not just be their life to be better for the improvement but also the now.
This is what economists is called a paretian paretian paretian paretian
One redistribution, it is not just the poor poor -- not just the poor -- because of this choices that choices us.
And he said, "Look, you can become all of the thing, you can become everything that means --
You know, people culture, you think, "What does that fish the fish sket?"
"It's obvious that you can't do anything in a voice in a voice of glass glass
"As imagination, a cool view view of the --
and I anks, I interpreted it like this, at the beginning.
But then, I realized that fish is that fish the long.
Because the reality of the fact that if you sent in frank my mous, so that "all it is possible," you don't get freedom. You get the paralysis.
If you rop the mouse of the mouse that you can become the satisfaction.
You can take the paralysis, and you reduce the well.
Everybody needs a sphere.
This is almost most cut, perhaps even too streck, and of course for us.
But the absence of some symbolic symbol for infelicity -- for the rock of the involved rock.
Thank you very much.
