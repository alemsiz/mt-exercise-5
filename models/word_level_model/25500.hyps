<unk> year I showed these <unk> <unk> that the <unk> <unk> <unk>, which for almost three million years had the size of the United States, <unk> <unk> <unk>, is <unk> by 40 percent.
And I'm going to <unk> this problem because it's not <unk> the <unk> of the ice.
<unk> <unk> <unk> is, in a way, the heart <unk> of the global warming.
It's <unk> and <unk> in summer.
The next <unk> will be a <unk> <unk> on the last 25 years.
<unk> <unk> are <unk> in red.
As you see, it <unk> up to the blue <unk>.
That's the ice in <unk>, which is <unk> summer.
You can see that the <unk> ice <unk>, five years, is like blood, which here <unk> from the body.
In 25 years, it's been been <unk> by this.
This is a problem because the <unk> is the <unk> <unk> the ground around the ocean, where there are huge <unk> of <unk> that, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
<unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, that <unk> could <unk>, that <unk> could <unk>, <unk> this point.
In some <unk> <unk> <unk> is <unk>, the <unk> is already <unk> from the water.
The <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> has <unk> with a team <unk> <unk> at a <unk> <unk> last <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>! <unk>: <unk>! <unk>: <unk> is good. The question is if you <unk> it.
And one reason is that this <unk> <unk> <unk> from the north.
This is a river in <unk> <unk>.
It had never <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This is the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
If you want to know how the <unk> <unk> <unk> on the sea level to <unk> on <unk>, here is where the sea.
These <unk> are <unk> <unk>.
On the other part of the planet: <unk>, the largest ice <unk> on the planet.
<unk> month, <unk> scientists <unk> that the <unk> of ice is in <unk>, and that <unk> on some <unk> <unk>, is <unk> on some <unk> <unk> <unk>, is particularly <unk> in <unk>.
<unk> at six feet of the <unk>, like in <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk> of ice, you see new <unk>, which a few years ago, they were <unk>.
<unk> percent of the world's population <unk> water from that <unk>.
<unk> <unk>: This <unk> is the source of water.
The <unk> is <unk>.
But when you <unk>, the same happens to the water.
<unk> <unk> on <unk> <unk> is <unk> 40 percent.
<unk> <unk> are in the crisis.
<unk>, as you read, they're <unk>.
<unk> <unk> in the world leads to a <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> are <unk> to a <unk> outside of the normal and <unk>.
Sometimes more <unk> in the last 30 years of the <unk> <unk>.
This is a <unk> of the whole <unk>.
If you look in the context of the <unk> can see the <unk>.
In the last five years, we've been <unk> 70 million <unk> in the ocean every day.
Look at the area of the <unk> <unk>, from <unk>, to <unk>, and on both the parts of the <unk> <unk>, where there is a <unk> <unk> of oxygen in the ocean.
The major cause of global warming, with <unk>, which is the use of <unk> <unk>.
<unk> is a problem, and <unk> is even worse.
The United States is one of the two countries with <unk> <unk>, <unk> to China.
And they're <unk> to build a lot of other <unk>.
But we're <unk> to a <unk> of direction.
These are the <unk> projects in the last years, and some <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
And so, there's a political <unk> in our country.
<unk> and <unk> <unk> and oil <unk> have <unk> million dollars in the last year to <unk> <unk> <unk>, which is a <unk>.
And I'm going to give me something --
<unk> <unk>, in <unk>, where I live, there was a <unk> <unk> billion <unk> <unk>.
<unk> you saw it on the <unk>.
This is the largest flow of <unk> in America.
It's happened around <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> of one of the <unk> <unk> was this.
<unk>: <unk> ♫ ♫ <unk> the <unk> is a <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
It's <unk> here in America, and <unk> our economy.
<unk> the <unk> is <unk>.
It's <unk>, <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Al <unk>: <unk> is a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The largest <unk> society <unk> is <unk>. This is its <unk>. This is its <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> <unk>. <unk> -- Al <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> -- they don't know what they're talking about.
Al <unk>: So the <unk> for the <unk> of <unk> has <unk> two <unk>.
This is one of them, one part.
<unk>: <unk>: <unk> we see the changes as a <unk> to our business.
So, in our <unk> is <unk> a huge amount of money in a <unk> to make public and <unk> the truth in <unk>.
In fact, <unk> is not <unk>.
We think it's <unk> -- it also a good <unk>.
So we don't understand the climate change.
We're going to be doing.
<unk>: <unk> <unk> -- you know, <unk> <unk> -- you heard a lot.
So, we <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk>! <unk> are a little <unk>, but this is the sound of the <unk> technology.
<unk> <unk> is between the major <unk> of global warming, but the <unk> technology of <unk> that you see changes.
Let's look at this: <unk> technology.
Al <unk>: <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk> to the economic question and the national security.
<unk>: <unk>: America is in the crisis; the economy, national security, the crisis.
The <unk> that <unk> all the <unk> of it: our <unk> <unk>, like <unk> and the <unk> oil.
Now, there's a new <unk>, <unk> solution to <unk>.
<unk> America: 100 percent of <unk> energy, in 10 years.
A plan to <unk> America to work, <unk> more <unk>, and help to help <unk> global warming.
<unk>, a solution that we're going to <unk> our problems.
<unk> America. <unk> more.
Al <unk>: This is the last.
<unk>: <unk>: It's about <unk> energy to America.
One of the most <unk> ways of <unk> <unk> to <unk> from the <unk> that <unk> our planet.
<unk>: The future is here. <unk>, sun, sun, a new <unk> network.
<unk> <unk> two: <unk> <unk> for jobs.
<unk>: <unk> America. It's time to be <unk>.
Al <unk>: A old old <unk> says, "If you want to go to <unk>, you go to your own.
If you want to go away, you go. "
We have to go far, fast.
Thank you very much.
<unk> year at TED I did an <unk> on <unk>.
And I'm going to try to <unk> how the car works.
So, I'm here. And for those who the other time, there were no <unk>, the <unk> is the largest scientific experiment ever <unk> -- <unk> miles of <unk>.
His <unk> is to <unk> the conditions that were in less than a <unk> <unk> from the beginning of the universe -- to <unk> million times a second.
All right.
This is the <unk> machine.
And they <unk> these <unk> <unk> inside the <unk>.
This is what I'm working on. It's called <unk> -- it's <unk> feet and it has a <unk> <unk>.
This is a <unk> picture of <unk> in building so you can see the <unk>.
<unk> <unk> last year, we <unk> the car for the first time.
And this picture was <unk> by <unk>.
It was <unk> <unk> <unk> in control.
It's an image of the first <unk> particles that he had all the <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, with a part of the <unk>, and <unk> particles inside the <unk>.
In other words, when you take that picture the <unk> <unk>, I think the car <unk>, which is a great <unk>.
I don't know if that was this to make us more or this, when somebody <unk> on Google and <unk> that the <unk> was this.
That means we've had a <unk> impact over to that scientific.
And I was a week later, there was a problem with the car, to just these <unk> here -- these <unk> <unk>.
These <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> when the car works to the <unk> of the <unk>.
Now, the <unk> of you will <unk> the <unk> and <unk>, "It's not true. They're <unk> too <unk>."
And they can do that because when they're very <unk>, they get the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
So, <unk> degrees, at a <unk> temperature <unk> to the one of the space between stars, these <unk> can bring that <unk>.
In one of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, there was a <unk> of <unk>.
So the <unk> <unk> <unk>, and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This was the result.
Now, this is even more <unk> if you think of these <unk> <unk>, and that's <unk> about 30 <unk>, and they've been <unk> about 30 <unk>.
They <unk> about 50 <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, what we then did.
We <unk> them and <unk>.
Now, they're all <unk> to their <unk>.
<unk> the end of <unk> the <unk> will be again.
And we <unk> it, and we try to get the data to <unk> or <unk>, and continue so our <unk> to discover what the <unk> are the universe.
Now, of course, in a way that these <unk> <unk> the <unk> of science and engineering <unk>. It's easy to <unk>.
I think the fact that it's so difficult, the fact that, I think that's the value of things like <unk>.
I'd like to end with a <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, who, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> experiments of its <unk>, its <unk> was Michael <unk>, said, "No, it's so <unk> for the progress of human mind, how <unk> the ideas are <unk>, that there are not <unk> in nature, that there are no <unk> in nature, that our <unk> are <unk>, and that there are not new <unk>.
Thank you.
I want to start <unk> <unk> to when, children, <unk> <unk>.
As I was <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, they actually think about and <unk> problems.
The <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> to the way that we're <unk> in the world around us.
So, from <unk> <unk> <unk> of our <unk> with <unk> objects, together to my <unk> <unk>, and my <unk> <unk> <unk>, I started <unk>, I started to say, "And if, when we use a computer, instead of having the <unk> <unk> as a digital, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with <unk>,
and <unk> to our <unk>?
The question was so interesting that I was trying to explore the answer, building <unk>.
In words, a <unk> is a computer <unk> like a <unk>.
In words, a <unk> is a computer <unk> like a <unk>.
You can <unk> them with their hand, they can hear their <unk>, they feel their movement and have a screen and a <unk>.
But <unk>, they're <unk> objects, like <unk>, you can just <unk> it.
<unk> are the example of a new tools to <unk> the digital information.
And as they become <unk>, <unk> of their movement, other, and they get <unk>, and as they get <unk>, <unk> of their own movement, others, how we can explore new and <unk> <unk>.
<unk> with some simple example.
This <unk> is <unk> to show you about the video: if you put it in a direction, the video, you'll see it, if you put it in a way, it's <unk> back to show.
These <unk> <unk> are <unk>.
If you <unk> them, you get to what's going around them.
If they're <unk>, they can <unk> it and they can <unk> a little bit.
If they're <unk>, they can <unk> it and they can <unk> a little bit.
They also <unk> their movement and <unk>.
We've got to realize that one of the interesting <unk> was that we could use common <unk> on the data, for example, "<unk>" a color like a <unk>.
In this case, we have three <unk> <unk> like <unk> and I can <unk> to <unk> the color in the central to where you <unk>.
and I can <unk> to <unk> the color in the central, where you get <unk>.
If we can <unk> it too much, we can <unk> a little bit.
There are also <unk> possibilities of <unk>, like <unk>, <unk> and <unk> and games where people can try things very quickly, and <unk> the results.
Now, I'm --
This is a sequence of <unk> that I do with a <unk> program.
Here we have a <unk> game.
<unk>, at every <unk> <unk> a letter on every <unk>, <unk> to every <unk>, <unk> to every <unk> <unk>, and as I was <unk> to <unk> words, he <unk> on a <unk>.
Then, after about 30 seconds, you <unk>, and you have a new <unk> of <unk> and new <unk> to try.
Thank you.
Here we go to the <unk> <unk> <unk>, I did the way I <unk> them, and I <unk> them a video.
They're very very <unk>.
And one of the interesting things like this <unk> is that you don't have to give people many <unk>.
They just say, "<unk> of words," and they know what to do.
Here we go to the people who <unk> it.
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
It actually wanted to <unk>.
They were just <unk>, for him.
Now, this is a <unk> <unk>.
You could build a tool for the <unk>. He's <unk>.
It can <unk> new characters in the scene, <unk> their <unk>.
It can <unk> new characters in the scene, <unk> their <unk>.
And that's what it's doing the sun.
<unk>: The sun is <unk>.
David <unk>: Now he's <unk> a <unk> in the scene.
<unk>: The <unk> <unk>.
<unk>! Yes! Yes!
So, <unk> <unk> and <unk> can <unk> the <unk> and <unk> can <unk> the characters --
<unk>: <unk>!
-- <unk> your story.
<unk>: <unk>!
<unk>: It's a story with the final <unk>, and it can decide how to <unk>.
<unk>: It's a story with the final <unk>, and it can decide how to <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>, <unk>.
<unk>: The last example I have time to show you is a tool, which I've been <unk> with recently and <unk> music.
it's a <unk>, which is <unk>, to <unk> and <unk> music.
The <unk> here are <unk> by <unk> <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> of these four different <unk>, and you can choose what to use.
You can also <unk> these <unk> in a sequence of your <unk>.
And they just <unk> a <unk> sound and a sequence.
These are the effects that you can control of live, like <unk> and <unk>.
I'm going to <unk> it to a particular sound and then <unk> to <unk>.
And then there are the <unk> effects like time and <unk>, which is <unk> to the entire sequence.
<unk> like it works.
<unk>: <unk> <unk>: <unk> <unk> a base in two <unk>, "the <unk> in a series, the <unk> in a series, the other base.
Now, you take a <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> now <unk> <unk>...
<unk>: <unk>: And now I'm going to <unk> the <unk>, so I can control the effect of alive.
<unk>: <unk>: <unk> the entire <unk> sequence the <unk> <unk> the time from one side or another.
<unk>: <unk>: And now you're going to <unk> the <unk> to <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>: <unk> the <unk> <unk>.
So I don't have to <unk> it, but I can <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
And now, finally, I can <unk> the entire <unk> sequence on the left <unk> <unk>.
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is to build new <unk> <unk> <unk> to how our brain work.
And today, I had time to show you one of the results of this <unk>, and some possibilities that we try to get out of the lab.
And the idea I want to <unk> is that it's <unk> this new generation of <unk> objects to <unk> the media, that <unk> information in our world in the way we want.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the time I'm going to talk to all of you.
They're a <unk>.
<unk> books is my <unk>, but more than that, of course.
It's also love and love of my life.
And I don't expect it to be <unk>.
But, I said, something particular happened in my life and my career, which has led me to <unk> the whole relationship with this work.
The particular thing is that I <unk> wrote this book, this <unk> called "<unk>, <unk>," which, "<unk>," which, "<unk>," which, "<unk>," <unk>, "<unk>"
And the result is that <unk> now, people <unk> me as if I was <unk>.
<unk> -- <unk>, <unk>!
I'm going to <unk> you all <unk> and say, "You're not afraid of you can't be able to do it more than?
You don't fear you continue to write all the <unk> life that could make a book that could <unk> to someone? "
that can <unk> to someone? "
It's <unk>, you know.
But it could go worse, except me that I remember over 20 years ago, when I started to tell people -- I was a <unk> -- I wanted to be a <unk>.
I'm going to go to the same <unk> <unk> by fear.
And people said, "You don't know you don't know you're going to have success?
You're not afraid the <unk> of the <unk> you?
You're not afraid to do this <unk> all of life, no <unk> <unk>. <unk> you're going to die on a <unk> of <unk> <unk>? "
So, you know.
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is, "Yes."
Yes, I fear of them.
I've always had fear.
And I'm afraid of many other things that people couldn't <unk>.
As <unk> and other things <unk>.
But, as I did <unk> what I thought and <unk> <unk> is why?
Is it <unk>?
It's <unk> that anybody who <unk> <unk> to be <unk> by being <unk> by a job that you feel like to do.
But what is so <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in a way that other <unk> <unk> in a way that other <unk> do not?
How would my dad, for example, he was a <unk> <unk> and I don't remember once in his <unk> years of <unk> in <unk> <unk> that asked whether they were to be <unk> <unk>?
And that <unk> was ever -- that <unk> John, how do that?
<unk>'t you like that, <unk>?
<unk>, engineers as <unk> are not, in <unk>, <unk>, <unk> the <unk> of being <unk> <unk>.
We <unk>, we have enough this <unk>, and not just <unk> but <unk> of all kinds, we have this <unk> to be <unk> <unk>.
And they're not going to <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> that, only in the <unk> century, <unk> young people and often <unk>.
And the ones that are not <unk> seem to be really <unk> by their <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, before he died, in the last <unk> said, "Every my book has <unk> me a little bit more." He's a <unk> <unk> about work of their life.
But we didn't know when you <unk> it when you say because we've heard these things so long that we have completely <unk> and <unk> the <unk> that creativity and <unk> is some <unk> ways, and that art at the end, <unk>.
And the question I want to <unk> all here today is: you agree with this idea?
And it's good for this -- because it's also a <unk> distance to me not good for that <unk>.
I think it's <unk>.
And I think it's also <unk> and I don't want to <unk> it in the next century.
I think it's better to <unk> our great <unk> <unk> to live.
And I certainly know that, in my case -- it would be very <unk> to start <unk> to that <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> the <unk> that I'm in my career.
<unk> -- <unk> look, they're pretty young, I've got 40 years.
I still have about four <unk> <unk> in me.
And it's very <unk> that anything that's going to happen now in then, it's going to be <unk> by the world like the work that after the <unk> success of my last book.
<unk> <unk>, because we're all <unk>, and it's <unk> that my greatest success is to my <unk>.
Oh, <unk>, what thinking!
You know, this is the kind of thinking that brings a person to start to <unk> <unk> <unk> at nine in the morning, and I don't want to do that.
I'm going to continue doing this work that I love.
So, the question becomes, how?
And so I think, after many <unk>, that the way to work to write is to create a <unk> <unk>, OK?
I have to have to be able to get a distance of security, and my natural <unk> on what's written about getting <unk>. And, as I'm going to start to look through time, looking for other societies to see if you spend time, looking through other societies to see if you could have better ideas and <unk>'s ideas.
about how to help people <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity.
And that research has taken me to the <unk> <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> because they <unk> in <unk> and then <unk> back.
<unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> -- people don't believe that creativity <unk> from men, OK?
And it was <unk> that creativity was this <unk> <unk> and <unk> to men from some <unk> <unk> and <unk>, for <unk> reasons and <unk> and <unk>, for <unk> reasons and <unk>.
<unk> <unk> these <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of creativity.
<unk>, <unk>, <unk> to have a <unk> that <unk> <unk> from far.
<unk> were the same idea, but they would <unk> that kind of spirit without a <unk>.
And that's <unk>, because the <unk> didn't really understand that a <unk> was somebody particularly smart.
I thought that a <unk> was this kind of <unk> <unk> that <unk> literally in the <unk> of the study of a artist, a little bit like the <unk> <unk>, and <unk> out of <unk> <unk> the <unk> of that I work.
<unk> <unk>, that's the distance I'm talking about -- that <unk> <unk> you from the results of your work.
And everybody <unk> that was so that they were <unk>, right?
So, artists were <unk> by <unk> things, like the too <unk>, you know?
If your work was <unk>, you didn't <unk> <unk> all the <unk>, everybody <unk> that was <unk> <unk> by this <unk> <unk>.
If your work <unk>, it wasn't your <unk>, right?
Everybody <unk> that was your <unk> to be a <unk>.
And so people are <unk> <unk> creativity in <unk> for a long time.
And then the <unk> <unk> and everything <unk>, and <unk> this great idea; we put the human <unk> to the universe above all the way of the universe, all the over the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and <unk> and no longer <unk> space to the <unk>.
This was the principle of <unk> <unk> and people who are starting to think that creativity completely <unk> from <unk>.
And for the first time in the history, he <unk> to <unk> this or that artist as a rather <unk> to a <unk> <unk> than a person with <unk>.
And I have to <unk>, I think it was a big <unk>.
I think you're going to <unk> somebody, a simple person to believe that they're like a <unk> like a source, <unk> and <unk> of all the <unk> <unk>, <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> is a responsibility a <unk> <unk> too big to <unk> human <unk>.
It's like asking someone to <unk> the sun.
<unk> and <unk> completely <unk> and <unk> all these <unk> <unk> on the <unk>.
And I think it was this pressure to have <unk> artists in the <unk> 500 years.
And, if that is true, and I think it's, the question, it becomes, and now?
Can we do that?
<unk> to go back to a more <unk> understanding of human relationship between human and <unk>.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we can't <unk> 500 years of thinking about <unk> <unk> in a <unk> talk.
And probably people in the audience who <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, you do <unk> people <unk> <unk> <unk> to their projects.
You probably don't <unk> you all about this thing.
But the question I want to <unk> is -- why not?
Why don't we understand that way?
Because it has more sense of everything that I've ever heard to explain the <unk> of the <unk> process.
A process, as anyone who ever <unk> to do something -- so, basically, everybody here -- knows, you know, you don't <unk> <unk>.
And, in fact, it can <unk> to look completely <unk>.
I did this <unk> <unk> with the extraordinary <unk> <unk>, who has now 90 years old, but it was a <unk> for all life and said that during his <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> out in the <unk>, <unk> out in the <unk>, <unk> out in the <unk>, and I <unk> it, within a <unk>.
He said, like a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And that <unk> <unk> to her from the <unk>.
I <unk> him up, because he was <unk> the earth under its feet.
And I was just going to be one thing to do, and he said, "<unk> like a <unk>."
And so he went to the house and he came from this <unk>, and he wouldn't have to take a piece of paper, and it wouldn't have to take a <unk> <unk>, <unk> and <unk> on the page.
<unk> times not to <unk> being fast, so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> without being able to get to the house and <unk> the <unk> through the <unk>, looking, like, "she said," another <unk>. "
And then there were those times -- this <unk> never <unk> -- there were moments in which the <unk> was almost <unk>, OK?
So, he was coming home and was looking for paper and <unk> the <unk> through, and he <unk> a <unk> in the time that she was <unk>, and then he was like, and he was like, if he was like he <unk> with the other hand and <unk>.
<unk> the <unk> from the tail and <unk> into its body and <unk> on the page.
And in these cases, the <unk> would be on the <unk> page and <unk> but <unk>, on the last word to the first word to the first word to the first word to the first word to the first word to the first.
So when I <unk> it -- it's <unk>, it's exactly <unk> to my <unk> process.
Not all my <unk> process -- I'm not a <unk>!
I'm a <unk>, and my way of <unk> is; I'm going to <unk> to <unk> every day and <unk> and <unk> on it.
But even I was in my <unk>, I <unk> against that thing, sometimes.
And I'm <unk> that many of you will do it.
You know, even if I work and ideas, I'm going to be <unk> by a certain source I couldn't <unk>.
And what is this thing?
And how can we <unk> it so that we don't lose your head, but, rather, that <unk> <unk> us?
As I'm <unk>, the best example I have is the <unk> <unk> <unk>, which I've been <unk> <unk> different years ago for a <unk>.
<unk> about this, and you know, <unk>, for the <unk> of life was the <unk> of the <unk> artist <unk> <unk>, trying to control, <unk> these sort of <unk> <unk>, <unk> these sort of <unk> <unk> totally <unk>.
But then <unk>, he <unk>, and he was <unk> on a <unk> <unk> <unk>, he <unk> everything for him.
<unk> fast and everything of a <unk> <unk> this little <unk> of <unk>, that comes into his head as the <unk> does the <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, and <unk>, and she wants, you know, it's wonderful, and the <unk>, but he doesn't know how to <unk>.
It's not a paper of it, it's not a <unk>, it's not a <unk>.
So he's starting to feel this kind of old <unk> <unk> in him like, "I'm going to lose, and I'm going to go to and <unk> this song.
I'm not <unk> enough, and I can't <unk>. "
And instead of going to <unk>, they <unk>.
<unk> the whole <unk> process and made something completely new.
He just <unk> the sky and said, "<unk>, you don't see I'm <unk>?"
"<unk> you can write a song now?"
If you really want to <unk>, you'll be <unk>, <unk> when I can take care of you.
<unk>, <unk> to <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. "
And its process <unk> <unk> after this.
Not the work, was still <unk> as always.
But the process, and the <unk> <unk> that <unk> had been <unk> when they <unk> the <unk>, the <unk> that outside him, the <unk> that came from him, where he was <unk>, he was <unk> that he didn't have to be <unk> and <unk>.
But I <unk> this <unk>, wonderful <unk> <unk> a conversation between <unk> and this <unk> thing that <unk> and <unk>, but it wasn't <unk>.
So, as I would tell that story to change a little bit about the way I'm going to do and I <unk>.
This idea, I was <unk> when I was <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>," and I'm going to go to one of those <unk> in which we're all working on something, and we're all working on something, and we're not going to do.
Not just <unk>, just the <unk> book.
And I started thinking about this project.
But then I <unk> to <unk> that <unk> out of the air and <unk>.
So I <unk> my face on the <unk> and <unk> my <unk> to a <unk> and <unk> my <unk> to a <unk> corner of the room.
And I said <unk>, "<unk>, what, we know, we know that if this book is not going to be <unk>, isn't it?
Because as you see, I'm <unk> everything I have, I don't have this.
So if you want it to be better, you have to <unk> and do your part.
Okay. But if you don't do it, you know what, I'm not going to <unk> it.
I started writing the same because it's my work.
And I want to be <unk> that I've been <unk> to do my part. "Because at the end is, so, OK -- <unk>, it's in the <unk> Africa of the North people to be <unk> for <unk> to the <unk> <unk> to the <unk>.
And they were always <unk>, because the <unk> were <unk> and <unk>.
But every once a while, <unk>, something <unk>, and one of these <unk> artists actually <unk>.
And I know what I'm talking about, because I know you have seen it, at some point, a <unk> like this.
It was like the time <unk>, and the <unk> <unk> through a kind of <unk> and it wasn't doing anything different from the <unk>, like the <unk> <unk> before, but it's all <unk>.
And suddenly it's not just <unk> as a human.
But it's <unk> by the <unk> and <unk> in the fire of the <unk>.
And when this <unk>, people <unk> what was, he <unk> what he was, he <unk> him.
<unk> your hands and <unk> <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, God," God, "God," God, "
That's God, you know.
<unk> <unk> <unk> -- when the <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk>, I <unk> this <unk> with them and <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> by "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, which you can hear in the <unk> or <unk>.
In <unk>, when a artist has done something impossible and <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>," <unk>, <unk> -- a <unk> of God.
And it's <unk> because we need it.
But the problem comes the next day, for the <unk> itself, when you <unk> and <unk> <unk> that are 11 <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> that are 11 <unk> <unk> and <unk> it.
It's just a <unk> with great <unk> to <unk>, and maybe never <unk> to that <unk>.
And maybe nobody <unk> the name of God still <unk>, and what you're going to do with the rest of his life?
It's hard.
This is one of the most <unk> <unk> to do in a <unk> life.
But maybe it doesn't have to be so <unk> if you don't believe, <unk>, <unk>, that the most <unk> of your being being here.
But just <unk> that you get the data from a <unk> of this <unk> part of your life that you have to <unk> you, when you're done.
And, you know, if we think it's all <unk>.
And so I started to <unk>, and it's certainly how I've been <unk> for several months during the <unk> of the book that I was soon, the <unk>, <unk> <unk> of my success.
And what I have to continue to <unk> when I feel like this is, I'm not afraid.
You don't <unk>. You just <unk> your work.
<unk> <unk> for your part, any can be.
If your work is <unk>, <unk>.
If the <unk>, you would be <unk> to you <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> some kind of <unk>, for one moment through your <unk>, then you know, "<unk>!"
You know, you do the same your <unk>.
And "<unk>!" <unk>! "
I think, I think, you know, <unk> <unk>.
"<unk>!" <unk>! "<unk>" <unk> "<unk>" <unk> "
Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk>: <unk>!
As you know, I've talked about some of these projects on the human genome, what it can happen and the discovery of new genes.
Now we're <unk> a new way. We started to <unk> biology and now from that digital code we're <unk> in a new <unk> of biology, <unk> and <unk> life.
We always tried to <unk> <unk>.
"What is life?" It's something that many <unk>, I think they have <unk> to understand different levels.
We tried different <unk>, <unk> to <unk> terms.
We're <unk> for about 20 years.
When we <unk> the human genome <unk> to go from the human <unk> to the biology world to the digital computer.
Now, we can <unk> life, or create new life from this digital universe?
This is the map of a little <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, which is the species from the smaller genome between what they can <unk> into the lab.
And we tried to reduce <unk> <unk> the genome to <unk> one even smaller.
We're able to <unk> a <unk> of genes about 500 that are here.
But when we look at its <unk> map, it's just <unk> to our own own <unk>.
<unk>, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can <unk>, one at one at a time, it's very <unk> that can bring a <unk>.
So I thought the only way to <unk> was <unk> this <unk> so that we could <unk> the <unk> to <unk> some of these questions.
And so we started the <unk> of "We can <unk> a <unk>?"
Can the chemistry <unk> to produce these big molecules that we've never been able to create before?
And, in case we can make a <unk>?
A <unk> is just a <unk> piece of <unk> material.
The speed with which we're able to <unk> life is <unk> <unk>.
Our ability to write the code, instead, <unk> slowly, but it's <unk>.
And our <unk> <unk> <unk> on a <unk>.
We've been <unk> over 15 years ago.
The process has <unk> a lot of <unk>, <unk> with a <unk> <unk> before you <unk> experiments.
But we found that DNA <unk> is very difficult.
There are <unk> of thousands of cars in the world that <unk> little <unk> of DNA, <unk> <unk>, and it's a <unk> process. It's the longer, the <unk> is long, the more <unk> there are.
So we had to develop a new way to <unk> these <unk> and <unk> the <unk>.
And this was our first <unk>, from information from information of the genome of the <unk> <unk>.
It's a little virus that <unk> bacteria.
We designed <unk>, <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> a DNA <unk> about <unk> and <unk> a DNA <unk> about <unk>.
And the interesting part is when we took this piece of <unk> material and we <unk> it into the bacteria, and they <unk> it into the bacteria, and they <unk> the <unk> particles.
<unk> particles are <unk> out of cells, are <unk> back and they <unk> the <unk> <unk>.
I've talked recently with the members of the <unk> industry that they certainly <unk> this model.
They have more of you.
And I think this is a situation where the software can actually build its own <unk> in a <unk> system.
But we could do things in big things.
You could build the whole <unk> of the <unk>.
They're more than <unk> <unk> <unk>.
So we thought about <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, so that we can change the <unk> to understand what the <unk> are the <unk> of a <unk> cell.
<unk> is <unk>, and if you <unk> information with <unk> in a computer, they need to be very <unk>.
When you <unk> this genome for the first time in <unk>, the standard <unk> was a <unk> for every 10 <unk> <unk>.
We discovered, <unk> <unk>, <unk>. If you were using that original sequence, you never have been able to do that.
One part of the process is to design <unk> <unk> that <unk> with all the other <unk> <unk> to build smaller <unk> to build smaller <unk> that <unk> together.
<unk> elements here.
You probably read you in the <unk>.
<unk> <unk>: We have a <unk> code on four <unk>: A, <unk>, <unk> and <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> of those <unk> <unk> <unk> together about 20 <unk>, and there's a <unk> order to <unk> every <unk>.
So we can use the code to write words, <unk>, <unk>.
What we did at the beginning was <unk>.
Some of them were <unk> by the fact that it wasn't <unk>.
We designed these <unk> to <unk> just <unk> with <unk>.
There are <unk> that <unk> them and <unk> them.
And we started to <unk> parts, <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> them to them to get to <unk> <unk>.
But every step, we have <unk> these <unk> in <unk> so that we're <unk> to create a very <unk> <unk> that we're going to create a very <unk> <unk>, as you'll see in a minute.
We're trying to <unk> the process.
So, this looks like the <unk> of a <unk> <unk>.
When you get to these very <unk>, much more than 100 <unk> <unk>, you don't get directly directly into the <unk> <unk>.
You get to the <unk> of the <unk> biology.
So we <unk> some other <unk>.
And they <unk> from another <unk> called <unk>, which in biology <unk> to <unk> DNA that will <unk> the <unk>.
Here's an example.
This <unk>, called <unk> <unk>, can <unk> three million <unk> <unk>.
You can see in the <unk> <unk> like its <unk> <unk> <unk>.
In 12 -- 24 hours, it's <unk> exactly like it was before.
<unk> thousands of organisms that are able to do that.
These organisms can <unk> completely.
We had to live under <unk>.
They're absolutely sure that life is <unk> in space, and you're <unk> to find new <unk> of water.
I mean, NASA showed that this is happening.
This is an image of the <unk> that we've built using these <unk>, just using the <unk> with the <unk> design of the <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> them.
This is not <unk> with a <unk> <unk>, but with a <unk> <unk>.
It's such a big <unk> that we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk>.
These are pictures that <unk> a period of about six seconds.
This is the <unk> that we've done a little time ago.
They're more than <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's the largest <unk> of a <unk> structure ever <unk>.
It's got a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
If you <unk> it with a <unk> 10, <unk>, you'll just <unk> pages to <unk> this code.
Now, how do we make it work? How can we <unk>?
<unk>, <unk> is a <unk> game is a kids.
It's a little bit more <unk> when you use bacteria.
It's <unk>, even when it comes to the <unk> cells like our: you can just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> another, which is basically the process of <unk>.
In <unk>, the <unk>, it's <unk> in the cell, but we have <unk> <unk> that we're able to do a <unk> <unk> <unk> from one cell to another, and <unk>.
We've <unk> a <unk> <unk> by a species.
<unk> are the two different <unk>.
We've <unk> some <unk> <unk> in a way that we could decide which <unk> to choose this <unk>.
He then <unk> it with <unk> <unk> <unk> all the <unk>.
And when we put it in the cell, it's been <unk>, and we <unk> our <unk> <unk> the new <unk> went into the cell.
And we <unk> that we don't want to go beyond, but we tried to <unk> it in <unk>.
This is one of the major <unk> of evolution.
We discovered that <unk> species have <unk> a second or a third <unk> somewhere, <unk>, <unk> in a second thousands of new <unk> to that species.
So who thinks about evolution as a <unk> just as a <unk> at the time you <unk> not understand the biology.
And <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> DNA.
The <unk> that was in the cell, you didn't know.
The <unk> <unk> that we <unk> is.
It's <unk>, and it <unk> the other <unk> like <unk>, has <unk> it, and we just <unk> with the cell and the new <unk>.
It's become blue because of the genes we've <unk>.
And in a short time, all the <unk> of a kind of <unk>, you go <unk>, and you <unk> it all over a new species, <unk> on the new software that we <unk> in the cell.
All the <unk> are <unk>, the <unk> are <unk>, and when you <unk> the code, you know, when you <unk> the <unk> code exactly what we've <unk>.
Now, this may seem <unk>, but we can <unk> the software, we can change things quite <unk>.
Now, I've been <unk> that here isn't talking about <unk> -- but of progress from the <unk>, and a half million years of evolution, and I said that maybe we're going to create a new version of the <unk> process that we're going to create a new version of this <unk>.
Why do that?
I think it's pretty <unk> when we think about our <unk>.
We're going to go from six billion people in the next 40 years.
Just to give an example, I was born in <unk>.
Now, there are three people on the planet to <unk> <unk>; in 40 years, there will be four.
We're <unk> problems now to get food, water and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> for six billion and a half billion people.
You're even more <unk> to do it for nine billion.
<unk> more than five billion <unk>, over 30 billion <unk>.
That means 100 million <unk> a day.
When we try to find <unk> <unk>, or any kind of process to <unk>, it's going to be a huge challenge.
And we have to realize that all the <unk> of CO2 from these materials that <unk> in the atmosphere.
At the day, because of the <unk> <unk> in the world, we have a <unk> with about 20 million genes, and I like to think that are the <unk> <unk> for the future.
The industry <unk> only one <unk> about a <unk>, and you think about how many different things are <unk> out.
Our <unk> here is <unk> data from the reality of <unk> and our imagination.
Now we have <unk>, <unk> to these <unk> <unk>, <unk> that can create what we call <unk> <unk>.
We're able to build a big robot that can make a million <unk> a day.
Think about <unk> these 20 million genes or <unk> to try to <unk> <unk> to produce <unk> or <unk>, new <unk>, we can change, with a small team, and create more <unk> biology now that in the last 20 years of science.
And it's just a standard <unk>.
We can choose to <unk> <unk>, chemistry or <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
This is a <unk> of some some <unk> software that we're working on to be able to <unk> and design species to the computer.
Well, we don't know how to <unk>.
We know exactly how their code is.
Now we're <unk> on the <unk> generation.
You see, you know, <unk> <unk> from the <unk> was a finished experiment.
We've <unk> second and third generation that <unk> soon from <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> like <unk> or different kinds of <unk>.
But the only way that biology can get a big impact <unk> <unk> the food and <unk> the cost of the food and <unk> the <unk> that would be <unk> CO2 in matter before, we're working for <unk> cells, and we think we can get the first <unk> of <unk> in about 18 months.
<unk> light <unk> with CO2 is a <unk>, but in our <unk> of <unk>, we found different <unk>.
This is a <unk> that we <unk> in the <unk>.
<unk> in the deep ocean, at about <unk> meters to the <unk> of water.
<unk> <unk> by CO2 using hydrogen <unk> as a source of energy.
We're trying to understand whether we can easily <unk> CO2, which can easily be <unk> by <unk>, <unk> that <unk> CO2 in <unk>, to drive this process.
So, short, we think that we might be able to <unk> what the basic question, "which what is life" is, we, we <unk> the <unk> goal of <unk> the whole industry.
<unk>. If you can't do it from TED, where can you?
It's a main source of energy.
And we're working for the same <unk> to create <unk>.
You've seen this year with flu, we've always come back of a year and with a less when you're going to find the right <unk>.
I think what you can change <unk> <unk>.
And that's how the future could start to look like <unk>, now, the tree of evolution with bacteria <unk>, <unk>, <unk> cells.
We're so much about the <unk> people.
Our purpose is to make enough to live enough to try to <unk> it. Thank you very much.
<unk> I'm going to show you, the <unk> <unk> possible, some fundamental work, in the new technology that we've taken on the <unk> <unk> to a <unk> <unk>. It's <unk>.
It's an environment where you can <unk> is at local level that you can <unk> with a huge amount of <unk> data.
And we're seeing <unk> <unk> pictures here with a kind of <unk> and <unk>, for a fast <unk>, <unk> <unk> the images like we want.
And it doesn't matter how big the amount of information that we see, how big these are, how big these data <unk> or images.
Most of them are common pictures, but this is a <unk> <unk> by the <unk> of the <unk>, and <unk> in the <unk> <unk>.
It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that <unk> the <unk> of a system like this is the number of <unk> on your screen at any time. It's also very <unk> architecture.
This is a whole book, example of data, not of images.
This is the <unk> <unk> <unk>. Every <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk>.
To <unk> that it's <unk> and not of images, we can do something like this, to actually make it really, to make sure that it's a real <unk> of the text, not a picture.
It could be a little <unk> way to read a book.
I'm not going to tell you.
This is an <unk> example. It's a number of 99.
Every big picture is the beginning of a <unk>.
And it really gives you the <unk> and the good experience of reading the real version of a <unk> or a <unk>, which is for nature, a <unk> kind of a <unk>.
We also did something with this one in the corner of this particular number of The 99.
We've created a <unk> <unk> <unk> much than what you use in a normal <unk>, and we've <unk> that <unk> in a normal <unk>, and we've <unk> that <unk>.
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk>, you can see it here.
Or some <unk>, or even the <unk> <unk>.
And that really <unk> some of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of space on the screen.
And I think this <unk> to put the <unk> and other <unk> like that, you can't have to be <unk>.
Of course, <unk> is one of the most <unk> <unk> for this kind of technology.
And I don't want to lose time, if not to say that we have <unk> to give us a <unk> to be to <unk>.
These are all the streets in the United States <unk> above an <unk> picture.
So now I'm going to go to something else.
This is actually <unk> live on the Web; you can see it.
It's a project called <unk>, which <unk> two different technologies.
One is <unk> and the other is a <unk> <unk> computer computer computer, very interesting <unk> by <unk> <unk>, a student of the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. A <unk> <unk>.
And it's alive on the Web, <unk> by <unk>.
You can <unk> when we do this kind of <unk>, where we can go from a picture to the other and have this kind of experience <unk>.
But the <unk> <unk> of the images here has actually meaning.
The <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>, and they <unk> these images, so that they <unk> to the <unk> <unk> in which the <unk> <unk> are <unk>. Here you see some <unk> elements of a <unk>, or <unk>, and these things have been all <unk> on the <unk> level.
I don't know if I've got time to show you some other environment.
There are a few that are much <unk>.
I want to go directly to one of the <unk> data, and this <unk> from a <unk> <unk> that we've done for the first time, I <unk> to show you what <unk> is really the key behind this technology, the <unk>. And it's not <unk> so much <unk> looking at the <unk> that we've put in the website.
We had to <unk> some <unk> <unk> and so forth.
This is a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> images <unk>. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> and <unk> images of kinds of <unk>, other <unk> and so on. And so on. And, <unk>, this <unk> is a picture that's discovery.
So, they're all <unk> images and they're all <unk> on the <unk> level like this.
And it's possible to <unk> it in this <unk> way.
You know, I would never thought of an end up.
It's very <unk> to <unk> this kind of <unk> here.
I think you can see that it's a lot of different kinds of <unk>: from those cell phones to the <unk> <unk>, a number, <unk>, a number, <unk> in this environment.
And if I can, I can try and look for the <unk>.
Many of them are <unk> by <unk>, etc.
<unk>, you know, it's a series of photographs -- <unk>.
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We can go from the <unk> to view of this environment.
The <unk> point is that we can do things with social environment. This is now <unk> data from the entire memory of how to <unk> the earth, from the whole memory of how to <unk> the earth, and <unk> all that data.
All those pictures become <unk> together, greater than the parts.
You have a model of the Earth.
Think about this as the <unk> of <unk>'s work on Earth <unk>.
It's something that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Their pictures are <unk> with <unk> <unk> by other people.
If somebody gets the idea of <unk> all these <unk> <unk>, I <unk> the name, my picture of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> all that data, and I can use it as a <unk> point of <unk> to <unk> in that space, in that <unk>, using the pictures of anybody, and having a social experience of <unk>.
Of course, a <unk> of all that are very <unk> <unk> of every part of the earth, <unk> not only by <unk> <unk> <unk> and images and <unk> and <unk> images and <unk> and <unk> images and <unk> and <unk> images and <unk> and <unk> images and <unk> and <unk> and <unk>.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I understood? What your software <unk> us to do is that at some point, in the next few years, all the photographs that <unk> in the world will be <unk> together?
<unk>: Yes. What's doing is <unk>, <unk>.
It's creating <unk>, if you want, between images.
And it's doing it on the content of images.
And it becomes very interesting if you think of the <unk> of <unk> information that a lot of these <unk> images.
As you do a <unk> <unk> and the <unk> on the Web has a <unk> and the text on the Web has a lot of information about images.
Now, what happens if that picture <unk> all your picture?
So the amount of <unk> <unk> and the amount of <unk> that <unk> is really enormous. It's a <unk> effect of the network.
CA: <unk>, it's really incredible.
<unk>: I'm going to <unk> you.
One of the main <unk> when you <unk> and one of the <unk> research is that we can live in who has no <unk> <unk> <unk>, between who has <unk> the <unk> <unk>, between the <unk> <unk>, <unk> it in the <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> it in the <unk> <unk> of plants.
You might think that <unk> <unk> <unk> still beyond <unk> <unk>, or that the <unk> <unk> are still <unk> <unk>, or <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> still <unk> <unk> the <unk> of <unk>, to remember the central <unk> of <unk>, and that the idea that the world in which the world we don't live in in any sense, but it's only a model of reality, but it's only a model of reality, but it is
And the <unk> of a particular <unk> of <unk> choices that our <unk> has done, or bad, a lot of <unk>.
And, of course, everybody is <unk> <unk>.
Everybody <unk>. <unk>.
We're <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We have to deal with the <unk> of death, so we don't know whether we're going to <unk> them if we <unk> and <unk> --
We all have a art.
What's the <unk> is the <unk> of the song, the <unk> of every culture.
It doesn't matter that's the <unk> of the <unk>, or the <unk> of <unk>, or the <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, or a <unk> in the heart of <unk>.
He was my <unk> journey in the <unk> a month ago, or a <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk> mother of the world.
All of these <unk> <unk> that there are other ways of <unk>. And other ways of thinking, other ways of moving around the world.
And, if you <unk> a moment, it's a concept that can give you hope.
<unk>, the <unk> <unk> of the world create a <unk> life and <unk> that <unk> the planet and is important for the <unk> of the planet, as the <unk> <unk> <unk> known as <unk>.
And you can think of this <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and you can <unk> the total of all the <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, ideas, <unk>, <unk> ideas, <unk>, <unk>, ideas, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk>.
<unk> is the <unk> <unk> of humanity.
It's the <unk> of what we are and what we can be as <unk> species.
And <unk> <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> happened to the <unk> and <unk> much <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, for example, <unk> that 50 percent of all the species has been or is on the <unk> of <unk>, because it's <unk>, or <unk> -- in the <unk> diversity -- and you don't even <unk> to <unk> the <unk> -- the <unk> of the diversity.
The <unk> of that is, of course, the <unk> <unk>.
When you're <unk> <unk> <unk> on this planet.
A language is not <unk> just by a <unk> or a series of rules.
A language is the <unk> of the <unk>.
It's the middle of which the <unk> of every culture is being in the material.
Every language is a forest of the mind, a <unk>, a <unk>, a <unk> of <unk>.
And of those <unk> <unk>, while we're sitting here in <unk>, at least half isn't <unk> in the <unk> of children.
They're no longer <unk> to children, which means, unless you <unk> something, which is death.
What's more <unk> than being <unk> by the <unk>, of being the last to talk about a language, not to <unk> the language of <unk>, not to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> or <unk> the children?
This <unk> <unk> has been the state of someone in the world every two weeks. every two weeks: every two weeks, a <unk> <unk>, and it <unk> the <unk> of a <unk> language.
And I know that some of you know, "I don't know?
The world would not be a better place if we all talk about the same language? "<unk>, then we're talking all <unk>.
<unk> <unk>.
<unk> of a <unk> thing means that we can talk about its language.
And I'd like to make you a journey through the <unk> --
a little <unk> journey in the <unk> to give you a <unk> of what we're <unk>.
Many of us are <unk> that when I say, "I mean," I really mean different ways of <unk>.
<unk> for example this <unk> <unk>, in <unk> <unk>, the <unk> of <unk>, which <unk> to the <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's a <unk> that's not able to <unk> the blue color from green because the green time is <unk> in the forest, which <unk> the <unk>.
They have a <unk> language and a <unk> rule, <unk> <unk>. "<unk>: you have to <unk> a person talking different language.
All of this has been <unk> in the past <unk>, the <unk> is that in these <unk> families, you're talking about six or seven <unk> because of the <unk> <unk>.
They're going to go and listen to it and then talk.
And I <unk> one of the most interesting <unk> I've been <unk>, the <unk> of <unk> <unk>, an incredible <unk> that had the first <unk> in the <unk>.
In <unk> five <unk>, they <unk> a contact <unk> a <unk> <unk>.
They did <unk> by the top photographs that <unk> them in <unk> that <unk>, <unk> that this <unk> forest <unk> had never seen anything.
They <unk> the picture from the ground, they <unk> a <unk>, and they didn't know, they <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk>, and they <unk> the five <unk> with the <unk>.
But the <unk> didn't just <unk> <unk>.
They <unk> to each other.
<unk> percent of the <unk> was <unk> by their own.
We were eight <unk>, and we found two <unk>, and we found two natural death, and when we <unk> to know, they <unk> that one of them was <unk> so he died, and then <unk> it. And then they <unk> it.
<unk> were able to recognize the animal <unk> 40 <unk> and to <unk> the species.
<unk> first years, I was <unk> a really interesting task when my <unk> <unk> <unk> me if I wanted to go to <unk> me if I wanted to go to <unk> to <unk> between the <unk> society at the base of the <unk> and <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> for <unk>.
To give a sense of <unk>, I should understand the <unk> culture, and that the <unk> is not <unk> <unk>.
It's pretty much of a <unk> view of the world.
Very interesting.
If you ask you to <unk> the big <unk> in the world, what would you like?
<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, etc.
A continent is all left out of thinking, thinking that Africa has no <unk> <unk>. And instead and the <unk> is not anything else that the <unk> of these <unk> <unk> very <unk> during the <unk> <unk>.
What makes interesting is the <unk> of the <unk> of life and death.
So <unk> do <unk> <unk>.
<unk> can be <unk> by the <unk> <unk>, <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the live in the way that for a short moment, it becomes the <unk>.
So, the <unk> <unk> to say, "<unk> you go to <unk>."
We <unk> in the <unk> and <unk> God. "
And from the moment that you're <unk>, is the spirit that <unk> you, how can you make a bad <unk>?
So, you <unk> these incredible events: <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a pretty strong <unk> of the power of the mind is <unk> in a state of <unk>.
And I <unk> all the <unk> that I've lived the most <unk> are the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, in the <unk> <unk>.
<unk> of <unk> <unk> civilization that once <unk> on the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> in <unk>, the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
In a blood continent, this <unk> has never been <unk> by <unk>.
And today, I'm <unk> by a <unk>, but they're really <unk>.
<unk> <unk> are <unk> away from <unk> to <unk> <unk>, and live in a world <unk> in a world that's made of <unk> and <unk> <unk> to the base of the <unk> for 18 years.
Two <unk> years old <unk> <unk> from <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
For this time, they're <unk> to the values of their society, values that <unk> their <unk> and only their <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or to say <unk> <unk>.
At the <unk> of this incredible <unk>, they're <unk> out and for the first time in their life, at the age of 18, they see a <unk>. And in that moment of the first <unk>, when the sun <unk> <unk>, everything they have learned in a theory of <unk> is <unk> all his <unk> theory, everything they've learned in his <unk>. <unk> does a step back and says.
"<unk>? <unk> like I told you.
It's <unk>. Now it's <unk>. "
They're called <unk> <unk> and they say that we, <unk> <unk>, we're the <unk> of the world's <unk>.
This is <unk> level of <unk> important.
When we think about <unk> <unk> and the <unk> environment and the <unk> of the <unk> environment, which is a <unk> concept in its <unk>, or maybe <unk>, and let's say these <unk> are <unk> to the Earth.
<unk> <unk> are not <unk> or <unk> by the <unk>.
There is no space for these things in the <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk>, but <unk> to the time and <unk>, have created a <unk> of the Earth <unk> <unk> not on the idea of <unk> <unk> <unk>. But on a <unk> <unk>, but on a <unk> <unk>: the concept that the Earth can only live just because it is <unk> by human consciousness.
What does that mean?
I mean that a <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> the mountain is a <unk> <unk> that <unk> is going to be a <unk> <unk> <unk>, and will have a very different relationship with the mountain or that place than a <unk> <unk> that <unk> a mountain, is a <unk> <unk> to be <unk>.
<unk> is a <unk> of a spirit or a <unk> is <unk>.
What's interesting is the <unk> that <unk> the relationship between the <unk> and the natural world.
I grew up in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> that <unk> to be <unk>.
That has made me a human being different from my friends that believe are the <unk> are the <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> in the world, <unk> that <unk> during the <unk> <unk>.
If you can <unk> that these <unk> can create reality, they can start to understand some of their <unk> <unk>. They <unk> this <unk>.
I <unk> this picture in <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk>.
Some of you may have heard about <unk> <unk>, the most powerful <unk> <unk>.
What makes the <unk> is not the potential <unk> of <unk>, but its <unk>. It's <unk> two elements.
On one side, this <unk> <unk> that has a series of <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
<unk> the only has a <unk> <unk> that <unk> a little bit, but it's <unk> with the <unk> of a <unk>'s family <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This <unk> has <unk> <unk>, very similar to <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
If you ever see the <unk> <unk> on the <unk>, the <unk> that make a different <unk> of species, <unk> has <unk> <unk>.
<unk> that <unk> on the <unk> is a little bit like being <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a sea of electricity.
I often was <unk> with my <unk>, Richard <unk>, the man who <unk> the <unk> was <unk>, with its discovery of the <unk> <unk> in the '<unk>.
And I think I can't <unk> these <unk> as <unk> because if you can't tell anybody to be <unk>.
It's possible to <unk> <unk> only if you could <unk> with other <unk> <unk>.
Now, the <unk> that are <unk>: the <unk> that are in this <unk> are <unk>, the same <unk> <unk> to <unk> the <unk>. <unk> question: in a <unk> of plants, how these <unk> <unk>, they make these <unk> <unk> two <unk>, not like this, but that if you <unk> in this way, they create a <unk> that's <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk>?
We use the great <unk> of <unk> and <unk>, which can <unk>.
But if you were to <unk>, we say, "The plants talk about it."
What does that mean?
This <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, who <unk> <unk> in the forest, and that our eyes <unk> in the forest itself.
If you <unk> how to <unk> their <unk> <unk>, you know, you know, you know, you don't know it? "I said," No. "
The solution is: You take the <unk> <unk> in a night, <unk> <unk> with a different <unk>.
With this not <unk> <unk>, but it's much more interesting than <unk> <unk>.
Now, the problem is that the ones that have heart <unk> <unk> them, but somehow <unk> to the <unk> <unk> are <unk>, but somehow <unk> to the <unk> of the history of the world than our real and beyond.
In fact, the <unk> century, <unk>, not <unk> <unk> for its <unk> or its <unk> <unk>, but rather like the one that we <unk> and <unk> <unk> the mass of the diversity and <unk> <unk> on the planet. Now the problem is not the change.
All the <unk> through the <unk> have been <unk> in a <unk> for new possibilities of life.
And the problem is not technology.
<unk> <unk> didn't <unk> to be <unk> when they put up <unk> and <unk> like this <unk> don't have to be <unk> when they put up <unk> from the <unk>, and <unk>.
It's not the change or technology that <unk> the <unk> of <unk>. It's the power.
The <unk> <unk> of <unk>.
And if you look at the world, you know, you know, they're not <unk> <unk>.
They're <unk> creatures and <unk> <unk> out of the <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, in their <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> --
a <unk> <unk> <unk>, in the <unk> <unk>, a <unk> that has been <unk> free in the forest to a generation of <unk>, and now <unk> to the <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk>, where you can see the <unk> <unk> from the <unk> that looks <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>,
<unk> <unk> with the <unk> with the <unk> <unk> to the forest.
Or, in <unk> case, it's the diseases that are <unk> with the <unk> of the <unk>.
If you go to the <unk> <unk>, where I'm doing a lot of research, you'll see the <unk> <unk> of politics.
As a <unk>, the <unk> physics of a <unk>, is <unk> at the <unk> level, but the <unk>, the <unk> of life <unk>, not only not just <unk>, but <unk> <unk> in certain <unk>, because it's part of the development of the development.
And you can't understand the <unk> of the <unk> until you go out the beginning.
I <unk> <unk> miles from <unk> in China through the <unk> <unk>, <unk> to <unk> with a young <unk>, but only <unk> to <unk> with a young <unk>, but only <unk> to <unk> me that I realized what's behind.
<unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> million people are <unk> by the <unk> during the <unk> <unk>.
The father of this guy was <unk> to the <unk> <unk>.
And that means that it was <unk> to the Chinese days.
<unk> <unk> is <unk> with <unk> <unk> during the <unk> that <unk> that led to <unk> <unk>.
My mother was <unk> and his <unk> was being <unk>.
It was taken of <unk> in <unk> at age two <unk>, <unk> <unk> her <unk> because she couldn't have to live without him.
<unk>, who has done the same, was <unk> in <unk>.
One day has <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk>, and, for this <unk>, was <unk> to the work for seven years.
The pain of <unk> can be <unk>, but the <unk> <unk> is from present present.
And then, everything is <unk> to a choice.
Do you live in the world's <unk> or want to <unk> the <unk> world of diversity?
The great <unk> <unk> <unk>, before he died said that his greatest fear was that, in our <unk> to this <unk> view of the world, not only <unk> the whole <unk> of human imagination to a <unk> <unk> to a <unk> <unk> that there were other possibilities.
And it's <unk> to remember that our species is <unk> for <unk> years.
The <unk> <unk>, which has given us to agriculture, which has <unk> us to the <unk> of the <unk>, <unk> the <unk> <unk> with the <unk> of <unk>, creating the <unk> of <unk>, creating the <unk> of <unk>, and we talk about <unk> years ago.
The world <unk> <unk> 300 years.
And that <unk> story, I don't know how much about the challenges that we're going to be able to face in the <unk>.
When the world's <unk>, it's what it means to be human, you know, you know, <unk> with different <unk>.
And it's in these answers that we all <unk> the possibility of being what we're: a species <unk>, that has to make all the <unk> and all the <unk> can be <unk>. And there are great moments of <unk>.
I <unk> this picture on the north of <unk> island, when I went to <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk>, and this man, <unk> me the wonderful story of his <unk>.
The government <unk> has not been <unk> with the <unk> <unk> and in the '<unk> to <unk> our <unk>, we <unk> them in <unk>.
The <unk> of this man is <unk>.
The family, <unk> for his life, <unk> all the <unk>, and all its <unk>.
You want to know that <unk> doesn't <unk> the cold, you know.
The <unk> of the <unk> <unk> fish were made in the skin of <unk>.
The <unk> of this man didn't <unk> out of the night or the <unk> that I <unk>.
It's <unk> off, you <unk> the <unk> in your hand. When I did it, they <unk> it into your hand. When I did it, I <unk> it <unk> her <unk>, he <unk> her <unk>, he <unk> it by <unk>.
He <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk>, and when <unk> <unk>, he <unk> a dog.
He <unk> the dog and created a <unk>, with the <unk> <unk> <unk> created a <unk>, has <unk> a <unk>, and it's <unk> on the <unk>, <unk> <unk> in <unk>.
<unk> talk about <unk>? [And that, in different ways, [<unk>] is the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all the <unk> <unk> in the world.]
<unk> <unk> the government <unk> <unk> the <unk> control of the total area of an area of bigger <unk> area in California and <unk> together.
It's their new <unk>. It's called <unk>.
It's a <unk> <unk>. <unk> all the resources.
So, an example of how a <unk> can <unk> with its <unk>.
And, finally, I think it's pretty <unk> at least to the people who has been in these <unk> areas of the planet, <unk> that they don't realize at all.
For somebody is home.
<unk> <unk> of the human imagination that <unk> to the <unk>. And for us all, the dreams of these children, like our children, become part of the <unk> <unk> of hope.
And finally, we're <unk> <unk> that <unk> never <unk> to anything.
<unk> that <unk> --
[<unk>] They are not <unk>, but we believe that stories can change the world, and maybe we're the best <unk> to tell the stories of the world. Every month our website <unk> <unk> <unk> million <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> our <unk>.
Our <unk> are <unk> by millions of people.
Our work is <unk> in <unk> to bring our public in <unk> to <unk> <unk> from which <unk> <unk> from <unk> how they saw and, <unk>, <unk> <unk> for the central <unk>, the <unk> world, and we have to find a <unk> of life in diversity, and we have to have to a <unk> <unk> world.
where the <unk> of all the <unk> can <unk> our <unk>.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book, I hope you've heard and <unk> <unk> some <unk>, in the case you haven't heard and <unk> some <unk>, in the case you don't understand them.
I'd like to start with what I call "the <unk> <unk>."
The <unk> <unk> of what?
<unk> <unk> of all the <unk> society. <unk> <unk> <unk>: "If we want the <unk> <unk> of our citizens." The way to do it is <unk> freedom. "
And the reason is, on the side, in fact that freedom is <unk> itself, it's <unk>, <unk>, <unk> for humans.
On the other one is in fact that if we're <unk>, each of us can act to their own <unk>, without any <unk> in our own <unk>, without any <unk> in the name of our.
The way to <unk> freedom is to <unk> choice.
The more choices people, the more <unk> are <unk>, and the greater than their <unk>, the <unk> is their <unk>.
This, <unk>, it's so <unk> <unk> in the society that nobody <unk> to <unk> in <unk>.
And it's also <unk> <unk> in our lives.
I'm going to show you some examples of what <unk> has made.
This is my <unk>. It's not particularly big.
I <unk> a simple note on the <unk> to <unk>.
In my <unk>, there are <unk> <unk>, without <unk> the 10 <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> and the 12 <unk> <unk> that you can buy a huge number of <unk> in the <unk> that you can buy one huge <unk> of <unk> in your <unk>.
That's what the <unk> is.
Then you go to the <unk> store to buy a <unk>: <unk>, <unk>, radio, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
And in this single <unk> store, there's a big number of <unk> <unk>.
We can make six million different <unk> <unk> using the <unk> that there are only one store.
<unk> <unk> that there is <unk>.
<unk> fields: the world of <unk>.
Once, when I was a kid, you could get all the <unk> <unk>, to <unk> that were <unk> by <unk> <unk>.
You <unk> the phone, you don't <unk> it.
And a <unk> of that, by the way, was that the phone never <unk>.
These days, they went.
Now we have a <unk> <unk> <unk>, especially between <unk>.
Here's the cell phones of the future.
My <unk> is in the middle, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, and <unk> for the <unk> <unk>.
If you haven't seen it yet you haven't seen it in the house under your house, you're very <unk> that soon.
And what happens is that people get into the <unk> and <unk> this question. And you know, you know, the answer is, "No.
You can't buy a cell phone that doesn't make things.
So, in other <unk> of life that are much more important than <unk>, you know, the same <unk> of choices.
<unk> <unk>: It's not going on the United States that you're <unk> from the <unk> and the <unk> you what you have to do.
Instead, you go from the <unk>, and the <unk> says, "OK, we could do it. At, or <unk>," he's got these <unk> and these <unk>. What do you want to do? "
You said, "<unk>, what do you want to do?"
And the <unk> says, "A has these <unk> and these <unk>, and <unk> has these <unk> and these <unk>."
"What do you want to do?"
And you said, "<unk> if you were, what would you say?"
And the <unk> said, "But I'm not her."
And the <unk> we call it "<unk> <unk>," <unk> "<unk>", "<unk> that makes it look like a thing.
But actually, it's not that a <unk> weight and the responsibility to make decisions from someone who knows something, <unk> the <unk>, to <unk> the other than anything -- and it's certainly <unk> -- and so it's not about, and it's certainly not <unk> -- and it's certainly not -- and it's certainly not <unk> -- and so it's certainly not <unk> -- and so it's certainly not a
There's a huge <unk> of <unk>, <unk> to people like me and you, that if you think about it is not any sense, because we can't <unk>.
But if we can't <unk>, why do we get them?
The answer is they want you to <unk> the <unk> to <unk> <unk>.
And so <unk>, as a fundamental question of choice, as you see in this <unk>. "We don't want to <unk> children. We don't want to <unk> children. We don't want to <unk> the <unk>." We need to <unk>.
And we can <unk> how many times we <unk>.
which means that every <unk>, <unk>, you have to decide what kind of person you want to be.
<unk> to the family and <unk>, a common time perspective, <unk> the common time perspective, <unk> almost to anybody, was there as soon as possible, and they <unk> to <unk> the <unk> as soon as possible.
The only choice was to who, not when, and not, and what to do after.
<unk>, it's really to play.
They're going to be very smart, and they <unk> their 20 percent, <unk> respect to a time.
And not because they're <unk>, not because they're less <unk>.
But why are they <unk>, <unk> to <unk>, "<unk> or not?"
"<unk> <unk> later? I have to think before? I got to my career or <unk>?"
They're <unk> <unk>.
And they try to answer these questions, even though this <unk> <unk>, even though this <unk>, and not get the <unk> <unk> that <unk> and not get a good <unk> to my <unk>.
And they really have to do that. They're important questions.
Now, the work is: we're <unk>, as <unk> <unk>, because technology allows us to work every minute, every day, every day, every day, every day, every day, <unk> from the planet, <unk> from <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, there's a <unk>, and I'm not going to tell anybody, where the <unk> works.
I don't tell you, because I want to use it.
What does this incredible choice of choice that we have about the work? That's that we need to decide, <unk> it at every time, if we have to work or not.
We can go to see our son to play <unk>, with a cell phone, the <unk> in the other, and the <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
And even though they're all <unk>, every minute that we see our son, I'm <unk>, I've got to <unk> this call? "
"<unk> I have to <unk> this <unk>? I have to <unk> this letter?"
And even when the answer is, "not," all of this makes your son very <unk> different from what would be in other conditions.
So, from all of the <unk>, little, <unk> objects, small materials and <unk>, life is a question of choices.
Once the world was this: <unk>, there were some possibilities, but not everything was about choice.
The world today's <unk> to this: <unk> is, "Is it <unk>, or <unk>?"
The answer is <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, we know, so I'm going to talk about the <unk>.
And they <unk> this choice is two effects <unk> to people.
The first one, <unk>, is that <unk> instead of <unk>.
With a lot of <unk> between which you choose, it's very difficult to do.
So, you know, an example, a study <unk> <unk> <unk>.
A <unk> has had access to the <unk> data, <unk> <unk> society, with about a million <unk> <unk> in different companies.
What she discovered is that every 10 solutions that are <unk> in more, the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of two percent.
With <unk> <unk>, there's 10 percent less than when they are available to be five percent. Why is that?
Because with 50 <unk> <unk> between which <unk>, is <unk> difficult to decide, and choice is <unk> to <unk>.
And <unk>, and <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and of course, <unk> never comes.
<unk> that means that these <unk> <unk> food to <unk> because they don't have enough, you know, it's so <unk> that they don't have enough, it means that the decision <unk> <unk> <unk>.
They're not going to be <unk> to <unk> <unk> for year from work, which would be well <unk> to <unk>.
So, <unk> is a <unk> of <unk> to have <unk>.
And I think it's going to be like this.
"And finally, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> or <unk>?"
You really make the right decision, if it's for the <unk>, isn't it?
You don't want to choose the wrong <unk>, and you give it the wrong <unk>.
So, this is the first effect. The second is that even though we can <unk> <unk> and make a choice, at the end, we're less <unk> by the way of <unk> states with <unk>.
And that's why different reasons.
One of them is that with many <unk> that you choose, if you choose one and not perfect, it's easy to imagine that you could make a different choice that would be better. And what's happening is that the <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> the <unk> <unk> by the <unk> <unk> by the <unk> <unk> <unk> by the <unk> decision,
And when it was a <unk> decision.
The more choices, it's easier to <unk> <unk> of any <unk> that is <unk> of choice.
And also, there's what <unk> call.
Dan <unk> has <unk> very well <unk> like the value that we give to things that we give things to what <unk>.
<unk> rest, when you have a lot of them possible, it's easy to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and being less than the <unk>.
Here's an example. I'm <unk> with everybody who are not in New York.
But that's what you probably <unk>.
There's this <unk> to the <unk>.
A <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>. <unk> day. It's all for them.
I'm not going to <unk>. But what he thinks it's, "Well, <unk>, it's <unk>."
"All my <unk> <unk> are away."
"<unk> <unk> <unk> right in front of the house."
And it's two weeks, I'm going to go to the <unk> -- every day -- the chance to <unk> where it wants.
<unk> <unk> <unk> for what we have, even when the choice was <unk>.
And the more are the <unk> that we have from <unk>, the more the <unk> <unk> you <unk> against how <unk>.
Here's another example.
This <unk> tells us a lot of things.
It's about living the moment, and maybe maybe to live slowly.
But the most important thing is that anything you're going to, you know, you're not doing other.
The things that don't know many <unk> that can make less <unk> what we do.
<unk> <unk>: <unk> <unk>.
I tried to my skin <unk> a new <unk>.
It's almost always <unk>.
Once the <unk> were just like, I <unk> them and <unk>, they were <unk>, only after <unk> <unk>, they were <unk>, only after <unk>, <unk> to <unk> a whole lot of times, I started to go well.
So, I went to <unk> a couple of them when the <unk> <unk>, and I said, "I need a couple of <unk>, this is my <unk>."
And the <unk> said, "<unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>?"
You want to <unk> or <unk>?
"Do them want to <unk>?"
"<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk>? <unk> <unk> <unk>..." <unk> to <unk>.
I was <unk>, and after a little bit I got to say, "I want the guy who was the only guy." He didn't know what he was, so for a time, I <unk> all of <unk> <unk> <unk>, and then <unk> from the <unk>, <unk>, <unk> with the best <unk> I had ever had.
It was the <unk>. With all that choice I had the best.
But it <unk> me worse.
Why? I wrote a whole book for <unk>.
And the reason I was worse is that with all that choice my <unk> were <unk>, the <unk> <unk> to be <unk>.
At first, I had <unk> <unk>. I didn't know anything about <unk> when I only had one guy, but when I had a different guy, it had to be perfect.
What I had <unk> was good, but not perfect.
After I <unk> that I <unk> with what I was <unk> to <unk>.
The <unk> of <unk> in the life of people don't make the <unk> that these are <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> themselves.
And this <unk> <unk>, even when the results are good.
<unk> in the world of <unk> <unk>.
Because if you <unk> it, I don't know what I'm talking about.
The truth is more to that.
"And he was better when he was worse," The reason you know, you know, when you know, he was worse than <unk> when he was <unk> <unk>.
<unk>, in the world that we live in -- <unk>, <unk> citizens with the <unk> of <unk> -- the <unk> that we can <unk> is that things are <unk> to <unk>.
You've never <unk> <unk> <unk> because your <unk>, my <unk>, my <unk>, are <unk>.
The <unk> of happiness -- what you're here -- what you're here is, "<unk> <unk>" Yes, you want. "
I mean -- small moment <unk> -- that I'm really <unk> and my wife is really <unk>.
I couldn't do better, I couldn't <unk>.
But <unk> doesn't always <unk>.
I mean, a <unk> of a <unk> <unk> when there's just that kind of <unk> is that when you're not <unk>, and you say, "Why?"
Who is <unk>? "The answer is <unk>.
The world is <unk>. What could I do?
When you have hundreds of types of <unk>, and you <unk> a <unk>, and you'll tell you who the <unk> is <unk>, it's clear that the <unk> is clear that the <unk> you are.
They could do better.
With hundreds of <unk> <unk>, there are not <unk> for <unk>.
So when people make decisions, even though the <unk> is <unk>, they <unk> and give them their <unk> to themselves.
In the last few years, it's <unk> in the <unk> world.
I think a <unk> <unk> -- not the only, but important -- this <unk> of <unk> is that that people have experience <unk> because the standard are too <unk>.
And when they have to <unk> that they think the <unk> is, they're.
So the final result is that we're better, <unk>, but we're going to get worse.
Let me tell you.
This is the <unk> <unk>, what we're all going to do for it, and it's completely <unk>. It's not true.
There is no <unk> that a little bit of choice is better than <unk> at all, but it doesn't make a lot better choice better than a little bit.
There's a <unk> value, <unk>. I don't know what it is.
But I'm quite sure we've been <unk> by a piece of the level where the choices are <unk> our life.
Now, from a <unk>'s point of view -- I almost finished -- from the point of view, the <unk> is the <unk>.
What allows all this choice in the <unk> society is the <unk> material.
There are many places in the world, and you know, you know, the problem is not that they have choice.
The problem is they have too <unk>.
So the <unk> I'm talking about is a <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> society.
And what <unk> is <unk> and <unk> is this: <unk> <unk> you yesterday of how much of those <unk> and <unk> <unk> to be <unk>. It's a <unk> of money.
I mean, these choices, <unk> and <unk>, it's not just <unk>.
They're <unk> <unk>.
They do worse.
If a little bit of what in our society allows choice to be <unk> in those where people have too few possibilities, it would not just their life to <unk>, but our.
This is what <unk> call a <unk> <unk>.
A <unk> of the income is good at all -- not just to the poor -- because of this choice in <unk> that <unk> us.
And to end, "<unk>, you can become everything you want to --
<unk>, people of culture, <unk>, "What do that fish?"
"It's <unk> that you can't make anything in a <unk>."
"A <unk>, a <unk> view of the world --"
and I <unk> it like this, I <unk>, in the beginning.
But then, I'm <unk>, I realized that the fish knows that the long time.
Because the reality of <unk> is that if you <unk> the <unk>, so that "everything is possible to" you don't <unk> freedom. You <unk> the <unk>.
If you <unk> the <unk> so that everything you could be able to <unk> the <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk>.
Everybody needs a <unk>.
This is almost certainly <unk>, maybe even for fish, and certainly for us.
But the <unk> of some <unk> <unk> is a <unk> for <unk> and, <unk>, <unk>, for <unk>.
Thank you very much.
