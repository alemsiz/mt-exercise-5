Last year I showed these slides to show that the article that the artical calot, which for almost three million years of the size of 48 United States of the United States has been stretched by 40 percent.
However, this undervalue the gravity of the problem because it doesn't show the ice of the ice.
The artical glacial system, in a sense, the heart of the global climate system.
You expand in the summer, and it comes out of the summer.
The next slide is going to be a quick carrelled on the last 25 years.
The lost ice local are signed in red.
As you see, you expand they expand it up to the blue Europe
That's the ice in the summer, which is retreatment.
You can see that the so-called the so-called five years or more, it's like the blood here is like the blood here from the body.
In 25 years old,
This is a problem because the exhibition is a problem because of the artc ground where there are enormous amount of carbon congelted -- that sheet sheet are transformed in meters -- they transformed by microbial microbes.
It respect to the total pollution, global warming, that amount might double, that amount might double, over, overcome come back.
In some deep Lagenhes in Alaska is already reboiling out from the water.
The Katey Walter of the University of Alaska was reached with a team baby base.
Video: Wow! Al Gore: Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow!
And a reason is that this termic exchanger the Greenland from north.
This is a glacial river.
The late brought never reached sex.
This is the Kangerlesuaq, in the Southwest of Groenlance.
If you want to know how to be the sea level of sea ice on the ground of the ground of the sea.
These current are increasing rapidly
On the other part of the planet. AAntarctic, the largest block of the planet.
The scientists have been delivered that the ice of ice is negative, and that the Western Antarcticket is in negative, and the Western Antarcticky Western suddenly is particularly quickly quickly in the sheet sheet.
Equival to six meters of water, like in Groenland, like in Groenland,
Sull'Himalaya, the third largest block of ice, you see new laghi, and a few years ago, and they were glacial.
40 percent of the world's population receive than the money.
Sulle Ande: this ice is the source of the clean water source of this city.
The brought is increased.
But when you diminusis, the same account is in the water.
In California snow on SSierra Nevada is 40 percent.
Midries are in crisis.
Sorves, as you have read, they are grave.
The sea sea sea because it takes to a remarkable increase of the fires.
The environmental disasters are increasing a rhythm out of the normal and without precedented it.
Four more numbers in the last 30 years than the last 30 years than the precedently 75.
This is a whole whole whole bongy.
If you look in the historic context if you can see it the consequences.
In the last five years we added 70 million tons of CO2 hours -- 25 million tons in the oceans every day.
Look at the East East East East East East East Americh, and both the parts of the subcontinent, where there is a radical impoor in the oceans.
The major cause of global warming, together in the deforestation, which is 20, it's the use of fuel fuels.
Oil, it's a problem, and the carbon is even worse.
The United States are one of the two countries with more emissions, with the most emissions, with the most emissions, with the most emissions, with the most emissions, with the most emissions, with the most emissions, with the most emissions, with the most emissions, with the most emissions, with the most emis
And he proposed to build a lot of other central central carbon cents.
But we're looking at a direction.
These are the projects that are the last few years and some evil.
And there is a political lotts in our country.
The oil industry and oil have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote carbon clean carbon clean carbon oxymore.
That image I reminded to me something's --
Very Natal, in Tennessee, where I live, there was a 3.8 billion gallons of carbon dixiety scories.
Maybe you saw it on the news
This is the second largest flow of America.
It's success around Natal.
The natalization of one of the carbon industry was this.
Video: It's coal coal coal ty;
It's abundant here in America, and it makes our economy.
Frosty the carbon is more and more and more and more clean.
It's good price, adorable and the workers are doing this up.
Al Gore: From here is a lot of coal West Virginia.
The largest major society on the mountains is Massey Coal.
Video: Don Blankenship: I'm clear to clear -- Gore, Nancy People Harry Reid -- they don't know what they're talking about.
Al Gore: So the Alleance for the Clima has launched two campaigns.
This is a part of it, a part.
Video: ALer: At COALergist see the climate changes as a nightful nightforward.
So this is to invent a big amount of money in a very high school in a high high school to make public and consumes the fuel truth of the fuel truth on the carbon track.
In fact, carbon is not sport.
We think it's clean -- it has a good profume.
So not push of climate change.
Let me do us.
Video: Attore: Carbone -- you heard a lot.
So let's do it a whole framework in the evanguard for how much coal coal coal coal coal coal.
Straordinary! The machines are a little roty, but this is the sound of the clean technology of the clean up.
The carbon consumption is between the main cause, but the remarkable causes of global warming, but the remarkable technology that you see it changes everything.
You take a look at this is the odiermain technology of the clean up.
Al Gore: Infine, the positive alternative alternative to the economic issues and the national security.
Video: Hool: Look America is crisi; the national security crisis.
The file that lines all that lines all that we have fossil fuels and the oil oil matter.
Now, yet, there's a new solution for circles.
Fif, America: 100 percent of clean energy in 10 years.
A plan to remaintain the work, make us sure safe, and help to stop the global warming.
Finally, a solution that you make our problems.
America. You get it more.
Al Gore: This is the last one.
Video: He's about the Hake energy
One of the fastest ways of finally finally dependence on the final dependence that they kill our planet.
Comparsa: The future is here. Vently, sole, a new energy.
Comparate number 2: Novi investment for places of good jobs.
Comment: Real America. It's time to be realist.
Al Gore: A proverbial African East African Electure.
If you want to go away together."
We have to go away very quickly.
Thank you very much.
Last year at TED I did an introduction on the LHC.
And I promises to go back to you like the machine.
So here I am here I haven't got to be there, the biggest scientific experiment that there is no longest scientific experiment -- 27 miles of circumstances.
His compit to reach the conditions that were present less than a billions of the universe -- until 600 million a second.
All this is just environment.
This is the machine in Ginevra.
Let's do these min-Big Bang in the relevels in the relevel.
This is what I work. It's called ATLAS -- it's an largo 44 meters and has a 2meters and it's about 2meters.
This is an ATLAS image of ATLAS in construction. So you can see the proportions.
We have the 10 sect sector, we have accepted the machine for the first time.
And this picture was taken by ATLAS.
It was because of a mestimates in the room room room of control.
It's a picture of the first particles of particles that had done all the LHC, entering into collision, deliberately, with a part of the LHC, and spreading particles inside the retail.
In other words, when we saw that 10 sector, we understood that the machine working, which is a big lives.
I don't know if it was going to do it exhasn't know if he went to Google and saw that the beginning was this.
That means that we have a cultural impact over the scientific impact on the scientific impact on the scientific impact.
About a week, there was a problem with the machine, it had to these movies here -- these sleep.
These files are 13,000 prints when the machine works at the male of power.
Now, the technical between you are going to look at the files and say, "It's not true. I'm will.
And they can do it because when they're very co-free files.
So, at least 271 degrees, at least 271 degrees of the space between the stars, these files can bring that current.
In one of the junctures between the LHC, there was a fluris.
So the movies are reading and 13,000 printing suddenly met a electricity.
This was the result.
Now, this is even more impressive, if you think these magnets, weigh over 20 tons, and that they were moved about 30 centimeters.
They were damaged about 50 magnets.
We had to get them to get them to do it.
We repristined and update them.
Now they're now coming back to their place on the ground.
I go the end of marze the LHC is will be new inteam.
And we accept it, and we expect to get some data to find what the right data is going to find out what are the morning we find out what are the morning that are the morning that universe.
Now, of course, in a certain way, these accidents reaccendending the debate on the value of science and engineering the frontier. It's easy to confuting.
I think that the fact that it's so difficult, the fact that I think is the value of things like LHC.
I'd like to conclude with the words of a Inglese, Humphrey Davy, the guy, whatever, I guess in the defense of his pupill, his pupill, his pupill, his pupill, "No is so dangerous for progress the human mind as much for progress the progression for progress of the human mind as we think about our trioes to be mysterious in nature, that our trioes are not new mones to conquitive ourselves to conquitive ourselves to have to fifififififififiques are conququs of our trions.
Thank you.
I want to start asking you to rethink how to kid, you play the morning.
While you realize how to reach them and grab them, take them and to get them and to get them to think and solve problems, and we can actually think about solve space and manipulating relationships.
The space reasoning is deeply connected to the way we understand the world around us.
So, from an informath inspired by our whole Pacific objects, with physical objects, with my Paci, and my Jevan Kalanithi, I began asking question: "And when I use a computer asking -- "And if we use a computer -- instead of having the mouse as a computer polypouse as a digital polyppray that makes you a digital information with entrames with ently an information with entrames both hands to redramygen with your hands to get into a computer objects,
and to our pleasures our pleasure.
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer, building to build the Siftable.
In a few words, a Siftable is a big interactive computer as a biokikikid.
In a few words, a Siftable is a big interactive computer as a biokikikid.
You can move them with their hand their hand their own -- they can see their movement and they have a screen and a wireless.
But most of course, they're physical objects, like the morning, they can move it just by afferting.
Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem for a new ecosystem for digital information.
And as they become more physics, you know about the movement, and others, and as they become more physics, and as they become more physics, and the others, how we move them to the move, and others, how we move them to exploring new funny stiles.
I'm going to start with some simple example.
This Sifty is configured to show some vide: if I including it into a direction, the video so that if they includes the other side from the other side side back.
These interactive portraits are aware of other people.
If you grab them is what they are going to be done.
If they come circumstances, they can get it a little bit of it.
If they come circumstances, they can get it a little bit of it.
They also have their movement and unlination.
And then we realized that one of the interesting interesting implications was the way to use community to use the data, to look at a color.
In this case, we have three Siftable confifigured as a blood and I can use them to address it to address the color in the central place, where they mix them.
and I can use them to address in that central that we miss it.
If we think of that, we can put it a little bit of it.
There are also good possibilities of learning -- like languages, the mathematics and games where people can try to try things quickly and see the quickly, and see the results of the immediately ahead immediately.
Now I'm --
This is a Fibonacy sequence that I do with a program of equations.
Here we have a game of words that is in half of the Scarabeo and Boggle.
And in fact, I received a letter to every smooth on every Siftable, Pratically, at every turner you get a letter on every Siftable, and while you try to compop some of the words of the words of the words that he control on a dictionary.
And then about 30 seconds remisses and you have a new set of reading and new set of reading and new possibility.
Thank you.
So here is what we had been on the Media Lab, I made them tried and I turned a video video video video video video --
They have a lot.
And one of the interesting things about this application is that you don't have to give you a lot of educational things about educations.
You just have to say, "Compions of word," and they know exactly what to do.
Here's what other people that try it.
This is our youngest better.
It actually wanted to get larable.
They were only morning, for him.
Now, this is an interactive paper too.
We wanted to build a tool, to get the learning of the English loud to build a reward.
It can be able to put new characters in the scene, lifting Sifty their associates.
It can be able to put new characters in the scene, lifting Sifty their associates.
You know, it's doing the sun.
Video: The Sun is surprise.
David Merrill: Now it led a treatment in the scene.
Video: The treatment.
Bel job. Yeah!
So schooling the Siftable and smooth it can interact the characters --
Video: Bau!

Video: Hi,
DM: It's a story with open final winning and it can decide him as you know.
DM: It's a story with open final winning and it can decide him as you know.
Video: Gule: Gulgat.
DM: The last example I have time to show you is a tool, made recently, to sample and executing music.
is a instrument, which was really, recently, to sample and executing music.
Siftable here are acting from sounds like base, lows, lower and bacteria.
Each one of these has four different variations, and you can choose what to use.
You can put these sound sounds in a sequence to make it compounds in your pleasure.
And then you just just touch a sound by making a sound and a "sequence."
These are actually you can control over the way, like the reversion and the filter.
You attacks it to a particular sound and then include it for it.
And then there are the general effects as long and volume, which is apply to the whole sequence.
Let's look at how it works.
Video: DM: We'll start putting a couple of Sift-like sequences, we get into a serious thing, we add it in a series, the extend to the low.
Now I put a bat line.
Video: DM: Now I add percent of the ...
Video: DM: And now I'll put the filter to the bacteria, so I can control the effect of the live.
Video: DM: I can fast through the time from a side or on the hand or from the other.
DM: DM: And now I'm going to add the movie at the bottom to get more expression.
Video: DM: I can recombined the sequence "flight."
So I don't have to plan earlier, but I can sudden, make it longer longer or more corrupt.
And now, finally, I can discover the entire sequence by the left the Siftable leftable to the left the Siftable "volume."
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is to build new interfaces of man-machine more like how our brain works.
And today, I had time to show you one of the results, and also some opportunities that we try to get out of the lab.
The concept that I want to transmit you is to get this new generation of objects designed to interact with digital media in our world in the way we want.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the time to talk to all of you to talk to all of you.
I'm a writer.
Sort books is my profession but it's more than that, of course, is more than that, of course,
It's also love and the fasassumption of my life.
And I don't expect to change.
But I said that, something particularly happened in my life and in my life and in my career, which led me to ricalibrate the whole relationship with this work.
The particular thing is that I recently wrote this book, biography called "Mangia, Prega, Amama" the quality, by my quality, for some reasons that I have a free -- for some reason, and he became a great senses.
And the result is that everywhere go from now, people are treated me as if I conviction.
It's true -- convicted -- convicted up.
They all come to me to all worried about and they say, "You don't get to do anymore?
You don't you fear to continue write for all the life that you can make a book a little bit of a book that can care anybody?"
that can care anybody?"
It's rassicury, you know.
But it might go worse -- part of the 20 years ago, when I began to say to people -- I was an adolescent -- I wanted to be a write about a writing.
I walk up the same reaction based on the fear.
And people said, "You don't you have successful to be successful?
You don't have fear that humiliation is killed you kill?
You don't have fear to do this mestize all the life without anything you come out and die on a cumulation of saming samp on a samp of saming with mouths of loving cenergy,
So, so, you know, you know.
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is: "Yes."
And I fear of all those things.
I always had fear.
And I also have a lot of other things that people might not be to be to be in it.
As the algas and other things are shown up.
But as I thought about it and I thought I thought and ask me the momentously, is why is it because?
Is it rational?
It's logical that anybody who should be spending on being spectated by a job that you feel nicked to do.
But what is there is so particularly in the creative imprese creative to make us nervous health in a way that other other people don't do it?
Like my father, for example, he was a chemistry engineer and I don't remember one time in his 40 years of activity in which he was asked if he was afraid to be engineer you know?
It was never -- that block of John, how do you do that?
It wasn't how much it wasn'ting?
And in fact, chemical engineers like a group of unclearly, in the several coat, and the reputation of being alcoholed managed.
We written enough this reputation and not only writers but creatives of any generally, we have this reputation of being enormous instabmentally.
And it's not about looking at the sad contact, you know, the magnificent of creative death that only in the 2th century, they die young people and often are young people and often get them.
And even those you are not suicide they really seem to be disappeared to be actually made by their woman.
Norman Mailer, before I die, in the last interview said, "I sleeping me a little bit of a little bit more extraordinary about the work of their lives,
But we don't just just take it because we heard this because we heard these things long, and we heard these things that are so interior and accepted the notion of creativity and the art, to the art, to the art, to the end, to the enjoy -- and the art, to the enjoy -- and then will it be going to be able to be in the range of the egosh.
And the question I want to ask all today is you know, do you know, this ide?
You know, it's good for this -- because you look at it from a centimeter to me not good for anything about this suppose.
I think it's odious.
And I think it's also dangerous and I don't want to see the perpetuated in the next century.
I think it's better to encourage our great creative minds to live.
And I know that in my case -- in my case -- in my case, -- it would be very dangerous to start to get that heart of supposed to the circumstances in which I am in my careful --
Ovely -- I mean, it's quite young -- I have about 40 years.
I have about four decades of work in me.
And it's very likely that anything I write about now then it will be judged by the world as a job that after I spent my last book.
I'm going to be slave, because we're all more or less friends here -- it's likely to my greatest successful should.
Oh, Gesus -- that you think is about.
You know this is the kind of thinking that brings a person to start drinking gas in the morning, and I don't want to do it.
I would just just just just keep doing this is that we do.
So, the question of the question, right?
And so I think about that, after many reflective and to work to write that is to create a psychological costructure, right?
I have to find a few way to find a safety distance between me, which I am written about what it reaction that he wrote to get the first year for all the last year patterns about how I began to look through time, trying to find other societies if they could have have the best ideas and more health and more blood than the most health and more blood
how to help people create creative people to demanding the risks of creativity.
And that research led me to the ancient Great and ancient Room.
See me because yet, it goes back into circle and then back back up.
In ancient Great and ancient Rome -- people didn't seem to believe that creativity is that creativity from men, OK?
And it was thought that creativity was this spirit watching the debate and selled to men somea few distant and unknown and unknown and unknown and unknown and unknown and unknown and unknown and unknown and unknown and unknown and unknown and unknown and unknown and unknown and unknown and unknown and unknown and unknock and unknown and unknocked it.
The Greek were called these spirits and the God of creativity dies.
Socry, wonderful believed that you have a demone that elargiving, wisdom that you can get an elargiving.
The Romors were the same idea, but they called that spirit without a genius of spirit genius.
And that's great, because the Romory, because the Romors, they didn't really think that genius was a very smart.
They believed that a genius was this sort of divine entities that was actually lived in the walls of the study of a artist, like the elf, and that came out to hide the articket Dobby, and to make the result of the articket and modeling the result of that I was living in that work.
Ecceptional -- there is the distance of what I talk to -- that psychological that you protect you from your job.
And they all knew that it was so functionally worked, right?
So the ancient artists were protof of you things, like to be too narcissssssnarciss; right?
If your own work was exceptional you couldn't take all the long time.
If your failure, it wasn't all your work -- it wasn't your whole bad?
Everybody knew that it was your genius to be a incapable of it.
And so people han conceived creativity in the Occidents for a long time.
And then the Raiss' rewards the whole thing came up with the center of the universe between all the military and mysteries and mysteries and unless to leave space to detailed creatures that write detail.
This was the principle of the humankindness and people began to think that creativity was completely from the ish.
And for the first time in history, it started to refer this or artist as a rather than a person with a rather than a person with a genius.
And I have to tell you, I think it was a big mistake.
I think that allowed someone to believe that a simple person to believe being as a recipient as a fount, and the essence of all the mysteries of all divines, creative mysteries, unknowable and an accountability a responsibility to give up a human fragile that human.
It's like to ask somebody to ingocile the sun.
It decreates the ego completely and creates all these ingestiable ingestive expectations on the performance.
And I think it was this pressure to have destroyed artists in the past 500 years.
And if this is true, and I think that is, the question becomes up, and hold it it becomes it?
Can we do it different?
Maybe go go back to a more ancient understanding of the relationship between human and mystery mystery creative.
Or maybe no.
Maybe we can't cut 500 years of rational thinking about a 18 minutes.
And you probably have in the audience that would smoke legitimate times, and you get the scientific suspects on the notion of the notion of the inner of the projects.
You probably don't know you all about this thing.
But the question I would like to ask is -- why do I know?
Why don't you think this is this way?
Because it has more sense of anything that has ever heard to explain the asperants of creative process.
One thing that has ever been attempt to do something -- therefore, fundamentally, all here -- yeah, it's not rationally rational behavior.
And, in fact, it can sometimes be completely paranormiles.
I did this recently recently with the Ruth Stone, who now has 90 years, but that was a little bit of a little bit of life and said that he was a little bit of the infant Virginia, and he was working out in the room, and he was working out in the stream, when a poem came from the landscape.
He said it was like a fragorous fragorous fragorous fragorous fragorous fragorous fragorous fragorous fragorous fragorous fragorous fragorous fragorous fragorous fragorous fragorous fragorous.
And that was rotolating to her from the landscape.
And he felt that it was to get the land under its feet.
He knew it was to have one thing to do to that point and it was to do that, "current."
And so it was going to be inherent home and it was followed by this poem, and he wouldn't have to make a piece of paper -- and a match fairly -- collecting it on the page.
Sometimes he couldn't be fast enough to be so quickly, so it correct and running out without getting to the house and the rotolated her and she was going to rotolating through the landscape, and he kept roll through the landscape, and he said, "other poet."
Then there were those times -- this is not going to forget -- there were times when the time that was almost losssweep, OK?
So, he was running home and he was trying to card and the poesthetic was going to cross; and he was a matched in the way he was passing, and he said, that was like to get out with the other hand the accident.
And he was offed the poetry from the coda and the released it on the page.
And in these cases, the poetry was going on the perfect page, and intacts -- but the last word at the first word at the first word at the first word at the first word at the first word at the first word at the first word at the first word at the first word at the first word at the first word at the first word of the first word of the first one of the first word at the first word of the first one of the first one of the first word at the first one of the first time.
So when I felt think -- it's crazy to my creative process
Not all my creative process -- I'm not a conduct!
I'm a mult, and my way to work is it to wake me to see me at the same orary every day and sweeping and go over the way to work and go over the time.
But even I know, in my head, in my head, I shopped against that thing, at the time.
And I guess many of you have this done.
You know, even though the work and ideas came from a certain source of it that was not going to be honestly knowing it.
And what is this thing is this thing.
And how can we relate to it to be able to make us lose your head, but we stay there?
And I think of it, the best contemporary example that I have is the Tom Waits, which I interviewed different years ago for a day.
We were talking about this, and you know, Tom, for the majority of life was the incarnation of the artist remainly constant, trying to control these species of creatives of creatives of totally interior interior of the creative impulses that creatives of the creatives of the creatives of life --
But then he swarm it, and a day when he was driving on a car in Los Angeles, changed everything for him.
He was going speed through speed and all of a melodia, and the wish -- it comes into his head as it does the inspiration, elusive, elusive, elusively and the wish -- you know, it's beautiful, and the wish -- but not as you take it.
It's not a piece of paper -- it has no matter, it has no no a matter, it has a recorder.
So it starts to feel this kind of old anxiety to him up, and he said, "I'm going to lose and shrimp from this lose area.
I'm not good enough and I can't do it."
And instead of going to the pania, he stopped it.
And he did something completely new mind, and did something completely new.
And he just looked at the sky and said, "cuse it, I don't see what I'm driving?"
"Can you do a song now?
If you really want to exist, you get to a more opport, when I can take me care of you.
Otherefore, you go to care anyone else today.
You go to disturbing Leonard Cohen."
And his work process changed after that.
Not the job, the work even even as it was dark as it as it sound.
But the process, and the fishing range that was released when the genius was released when the genius was caused to the back, and free it remainly remaintained that he had to be an interior to be remained and tormented the torment, and tormented the torment.
but he knows this peculiar bizarre collaboration between Tom and this external thing. And this strange thing was not Tomom.
So how much the story started to change a little bit of the way I worked and already saved me a time.
This idea, I saved me when I was writing "Mangia, Prega, Amae falling in a disperation that we all see when we are working on something and we can't get to think that it's going to be a detail, which is going to be a disaster, that that is going to be the worst book that it would be the worst book before.
Not just good at the worst book written book.
And I began to think about throw this project.
But then I reminded from Tom who talked to the air and trial.
So I went up to my face on the hands of the manuface, and I would say my comments to a room.
And I said, "You know, you know, you can both know that if this book is not she'll be brilliant not be brilliant, right?
Because as I see what I'm going to be doing is I haven't got to do that.
So if you want to be better and you have to introduce your hand to it.
Okay, but if you don't do it you know it, I don't do it all me.
I'm going to write this is my work.
And I would like to favor that was recorded to do my own own me to do my own particular." Because -- finally, it's like this, you have -- centuries in North Africa people who were ranged for dances to the dances of the dances of the dances of the dances of the walls and the walls to the walk up to the walk up to the walk up up to the walk up to the walk up to the walk up to the walk up to the walk up the wing day."
And they were always magnificent because the dances, were professionals, and they were fantastic.
But every time, I rarely rarely something happened, and one of these artists became actually transition.
And I know what I talk about it, because I know you all of it, at a certain point, a lost way.
It was like the time you stops and the dance, and he walk through a kind of portal and he wasn't doing anything from the sunnny of the sunny -- like 1,000 nights, but all you get to the back.
And suddenly not only as a human as a human --
But it turns out from the divince and in the fire of the divinity.
And when this happens, the time this happen, the people knew what he was, they called him with her name.
They went up with the hands and started singing, "Allah, Allah, God Did, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God.
That's God, you know, that's it.
The historic note -- when the Moreder ags invasero the Spain, they predicted this habitude and the ready of the "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, O, Of course, you can hear in the corride or in the famenic.
In Spay when a artist has made something impossible and magic -- "Allah, you know, magnified, you know, a Good, artical, exceedbited -- a God.
And it's great, because we needed it.
But the problem comes the next day, for the dance, the dance, when you wake up and it turns out that they are 11 in the morning, and the last of Dod is not morning
It's just a mortal with great male to the knees -- and it may not be able to get to that height.
And maybe nobody will give God still as yet, and what does it have to do with the rest of his life?
It's hard.
This is one of the most painful resources to make a creative life
But perhaps it doesn't have to be so angoscious if you can not be so angoscious about your being being being being being from yourself to be being being being being being being from yourselves.
But I just believe that there are actually data in the prestituted by a fount of this team of the life that you have to go to somebody.
And, you know, if we think about this whole change.
And so I began to think about it, and it's sure how I thought it for severally in the work of the book that I will be in the audience of the book that I will do prestant, the dangerous spectacy followed my great success.
And what I have to keep tells me when I feel electrized me to be pushed by this is, not being fear.
Not just just like your job. It just makes your job.
It keeps presenting for your hand, any of them to your hand, any of it.
If your work is dance.
If the goal, I assurd, I assume to leave you some kind of wonderful -- just just like this, for a moment through your effort, then "Oh, y!"
Other you do the same dance.
And "Oh, y!" to yourself with itself.
I think I think it's got to teach it.
"H!" to yourself -- even only for that we had love and tests and testing talks to give you a continue to be will.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
As you know, I've already talked about some of these projects on the genome of the genome of new genes.
We're starting a new performance, we started digitalize biology and now starting from that digital code we are entering into a new phase of biology, designing and synthesizing life.
We always tried to ask the big questions.
"What is the life?" is something that many biologists I think we tried to understand levels.
We tried a different approach, reducing it to minimes to minime the end.
We're digitalizing for almost 20 years ormas.
When we sequenced the human genome was treated to spend the world of the computer biology world.
Now we ask ourselves: can we regenerate life, or create new life from this digital universe?
This is the map of a small organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, which is the species from the smallest genome between those that can self-replicate in the laboratory.
And we tried to reduce the genome to create one more smaller.
We can eliminate a center of genes about 500 genes of about 500 that are here.
But when we look at the metabolic map to the metabolic map to the noad.
I would just be in my way, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate one at the time, it's very unlikely that this can bring a living cell viouse.
So we decided that the only way to progressive to synthesize this chromote so that we could make the components to bring the components to bring some of these questions.
And so we began the avigate of the "Can we can synthesize a chromost?"
Can you make the chemistry to produce these great molecules that we haven't able to create before I hold it?
And in case we have a functional chromosoun?
A chromote is just a piece of chemistry of unher.
The speed with which we can digitalize life is growing is growing at exponential res.
our capacity to write the genetic code, aging code, it's improving.
And our most recently, the results take a exponential curve.
We started more than 15 years ago.
And the process took a lot of past spend, starting with a bioetic review before we begin the first experiments.
But we found that DNA is very difficult.
There are tens of thousands of the world that are small-segments, in the long long chance of 30 to 50 letters and it's a degenerative process -- the most segment is longer to be the longer segment is longer mistakes.
So we had to develop a new method to assemble, and the mistake the mistakes.
And this was our first attempt to start to start to the digital information genome of the Phi Talio 174.
It's a little virus that kills bacteria.
We designed the fragments, effects the reeffort correct of the DNA errors and get a molecules of DNA
The interesting part is when we took this chemistry of unher, unununerated it into bacteriums, bacterium, bacteria started reading this genetic code and to produce particles them.
The virals have been released by the cell -- they come back and they fit the E.
I talked about recent recent membrings of the petrolife's said that they have certainly understood this model.
They have more than you do.
We believe that this is a situation where software can really build his hardware in a biological system.
But we wanted to do the biggest things --
We wanted to build the entire chromosome.
It's 580 miles that genetic code --
So we thought about building it in the size of viruses so that we can change the cassets to understand what the components are the components of a vivivivivivivious;
The design is crucial and if we start with digital information, these have to be very accurated.
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995, the standard accuratacy was a mistake for every 10 mile triggers.
We discovered, resequencing, 30 mistert mistakes. If we had the original sequence we never had to do it work.
One part of the process is designing long segments that are overwhelmed with all the other segments of 50 letters to build up up smaller than 50 letters to build underunits smaller working together.
Let's try to address here.
You probably have you probably read the right-we put the flist we put it on the flist we put it in the layer.
Think about this this is we have a genetic code based on four letters: A, C, G.
Three of those reads together about 20 adminiopacids, and there's a specific order to be a specific order to bed every aminoidd.
So we can use genetic code to write words, you think, fraise -- you know, you think about it.
What we did in the beginning was self-to do about it.
Some of them have been dolphuses from the fact that it wasn't poem.
We designed these segments to just unife with a fundamental unit.
There are enzymes that are and they put them up and asyeah.
And we began to assembling from five to seven miletter from five to seven miletter to seven miletter to be able to form sit of 24 miles that to 72 miles to get to 72 milletter together.
In each step of the segments that we have these slunting segments that we are trying to create a very robate except -- as you see in a minute.
We're trying to automatize the process.
So this seems to the tabellon a basket.
When we get these very longer segments -- more than 100 mile than 100 miles on the E.
You get to the modern of molecular biology --
So we looked at other mechanisms.
We knew about another mechanism called a Hun, which is a biology of biology, which is useful to repair the DNA to unide DNA that can unide the segments.
Here's an example.
This organism, called Deinococcus radioharans, can absorb three million rads of radiation.
You can see in the soanger as his chromosome, you can see in the sound of the ground.
In 12 -- 24 hours reassembled exactly how it was before.
There are thousands of organisms that have been able to do it.
These organisms can be able to be complex.
They can live under a vacuum.
I'm absolutely sure life exists in space, and you get to find new rich environments of water.
NASA showed that NASA showed that this happen.
This is a picture of molecules that we built using these processes using these processes by the design of inserious chappropriate of the inserious design segments to inserious inseries.
The lievidence is automatically.
This image was not taken with an electronic microscope -- but with a regular.
It's a great molecule so that we can see it with a slightly read it.
These are pictures that they cover a period of six seconds.
This is the publishing we did a little time ago.
It's 580,000 letters reads.
It's the largest molecule of a defined structure that ever created by man.
It has a 300 million.
If we stand we spent it with a 10 without spaces, they would like 142 pages just to transform this genetic code for this genetic code --
Now, how do we make it work? How do we active?
Obviously, you get a virus is a game by kids.
It's a little more complicated when you use bacteria.
It's simpler even when it's euuuuuuotic cells like ourselves, you can just extract the nucleus and put it up to each other, which is basically the clone.
In the bacterium archaea is a complete inside the cell but we have recently showed that we can do a complete train of a chromosome, and to active.
We clean an an an inner tailing from a microbial species.
The two are the different than men from the topis.
We added a few genes in the way that we can decide what to chromote for this chromote to the chromote to the chromoe.
And then I skip with the enzymes so that you can kill all proteins.
And when we put it in the cell was stupendoctor, and you open our graphy sophisticato-- the new chromosome, he went inside the cell
And we began to think that we couldn't go that -- but we tried to get us more in there.
This is one of the major mechanisms of evolution.
We found that many species have added a second or a third chromosome, or a third chromosome, adding in a second thousands of new trats tracks to that species.
So who think about evolution as a only gene to evolution as a gene gene that has not understood much of biology.
There are enzymes called restripes of restrictions are that admit DNA.
The chromosomes that was in the cell doesn't have one.
The cell ph-tailed cell that we inseritos.
And it turns out, and it recognized the other chromosome, as an extreme -- and we were retreated, and we were retreasking with just the cell and the new chromo.
It became blue because of the genes that we have inserved.
And in a short time of all the characteristics of a species have gone in a new species, based on a new species, based on a new software that we put in in the cell phone.
All the protein has changed, membranes have changed, and when we read the genetic code balance, exactly what we have transfitted you.
Now, this might look like genetic alchemy but we can change things in a pretty substantial treatment.
Now, I explained that this is not about genesis -- but progress from three million years and a half million years and a half million years and a half of evolution, and I said that maybe we're going to create a new version of Cambrian explosion of this digital explosion process.
Why do I do that?
I think it's obvious when we think about our needs.
We're going to spend six and a half billion people to nine in the next 40 years.
Just for an example: I was born in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for each one existing in 1946; 40 years, there will be four years, there will be four or there are going to be a couple of people on the planet for each other.
We're having a good time to find food, fresh water and clean, medicinal and gasoline for six and a half billion people.
It's going to be even harder doing it for nine billion.
We use more than five billion carbon over 30 billion carbon barils.
That means millions of barils a day.
When we try to find biological processes or any kind of process to rempire them, it's going to be a huge challenge of it.
We have to keep the whole hemission of the CO2 from these materials that ends into the atmosphere.
At the day, because of the scientific discoveries around the world, we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I like to think that are the designed for the future.
The electric industry has only a dozen dozen about how many different things have come out.
Our limitations here are principlely from the reality and our imagination.
Now we have techniques to these symptetesization, can create what we call a combinative genomics,
We can build a big robot that can produce a million chromosomes a day.
Think about these 20 million genes of different genes or to try to optimize the processes to produce either either vaccines, we can change through a little team, and create more biology than molecular biology now that in the last 20 years of science.
And it's just a standard section.
We can choose for chance of survival, or fueling ethc.
This is an instant instant of some software programs that we're working for being able to sit and design species to the computers.
Well, we don't necessarily know how they do.
We know exactly what their genetic code code --
Now we're focused on the fourth generation of fourth generation.
You see you that you can see that you get them from the grand hit was a bad experiment.
We have a second and third generation that will be pretty soon from the higher generation of the higher than the value like the eight and different kinds of sits like the either and different kinds of sits of the treatment.
But the only way biology can have a great impact without increasing more than food and limiting the cost of food and to limimit the deliliability, it would be transforming the CO2 in material, so we are working to design that we can reach this purpose, and we can get this pursuit and we can get the first carbon fourth generation in about 18 months.
The sunlight combined with CO2 is a methodo-- but in our discoveries all over the world, we found different methods.
This is an organism that we described in 1996.
It lives in the deep, about 2,500 meters to the temperature of the water.
It creates meter from CO2 molecular hydrogen molecular as a source of energy.
We're trying to understand if we can get the CO2, which can easily be transported by tubes, converting that CO2 in the carbon on the fuel of carbon to drive this process.
So short we think we might be able to increase what the basic question is, "What is life," is the way, really, -- we have the reason to remit the whole petroleum of petrole-petroles.
Exactly. If you can't do it from TED, where can you do it?
It would say it would be a main source of energy.
And we're also working to use the same methods to make the same methods to create instantanes.
You saw this year with the influence, we're always backed back of a year and a dollar, at least when it comes to find the right vaccine.
I think that you can change in a combinable vaccines in anticipy.
So here's how the future might start to look change, now, the evolution, accelerating the evolution with synthetic bacteria -- archaaaaaahs, archaaaaaos, and then finally hitting the eucarious cells.
We are so so much from improving people.
Our goal is to make a long way of living enough to try to do celelelel. Thank you very much.
Before I will show you the most rapidly as we can see a fundamental job, the new technology that we took the Microsoft in a watering, exactly. This is Seadragon.
It's an environment where you can interact with is a local levels of visual data --
Here we're seeing a lot of gigabyte of digital phototos with a kind of zoom and continue, for a speed speed bread of bread, deaving with images as we want.
And it doesn't matter how big the amount of information that we see -- how big these collects of data or images.
Most of them are all digital photographs, but this is a scale from the Library of Congress, and receive in the legal of Congress, and rewing in the legal of Congress,
It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that limits the predictions of a system like this is the number of pixels on your screen at any time. It's also a very flexible architecture.
This is a book of unbelieve.
This is Dickens. Every coonna represents a chap.
To shown you that it's just about test, and I don't image about it, to see that it really is that it's a real representation of a real head, not a picture.
It might be a little artificial way to read an electronic book.
Don't you recommen.
This is a more realistic example of the Guardian number of The Guardian ardian.
Every image is the beginning of a section.
And it really gives you the pleasure of reading the experience of reading the paper version of a magazine or a fiffour, which is nature a multiple types of a methotid.
We also did something with the corner of this particular number in the CGuardian.
We created a fasulla high-resolution-resolutions, much more than what you use in a normal publicity; and we put you in the extraordinary content content content on it.
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile, you can see here.
Or other models, or even specific specific that we can do it.
And this really demonstrates some of these ideas to eliminate the limitations of space on the screen.
And we hope this lememploy putting to pop-up pop-up and other sible, not to be necessary.
Of course, the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology.
And I don't want to lose time, if not to say that we have contributed to this field.
These are all the streets in the United States over, you know, in the NASA.
So now we go to something else.
This is now now it's actually from the vision of the web; you can see it here.
It's a project called Photosynth, which is two different technologies.
One is Seadragon and the other one is a visual computer to do very interesting computer that is made by Noah Snavely, a student of Washington, with Steve Seitz UWashington, with Steve Research Szelii of Microsoft Research. A very good collaboration.
And it's from the living web, running from Seadragon.
You can see it when we do this kind of screens, where we can spend on a other and have this kind of a picture of the multiply.
But the space collotion of images here has actually a meaningful meaning.
The computer algorithms of computer have recorded these images together, so that they correspond to the real places that are real. And you can see all the way the real. You can see on the Mountain Grassi on Montne Roccious Three of the canakes -- have been craced. So you see some of this stable electric ards or images of space.
I don't know if I have time to show you some other environment.
There are a lot more space.
I want to spend one of the original set of data from Noah, and this is from a previous protoide of Photosynth that we did work for the first time last summer, to show you what I think is really the chid -- to show you what I think is the key behind this technology, Phosyness. And it's not necessarily so much evident that we have in the website --
We had to worry about legal aspects and so on.
This is a reconstruction of Notre Dame images Flickr. Basta Flickr. Basta Flickr. Basta Flickr. Bastr and you get images of the camppines of the camppining around, and you get the argues of these argues --
So they're all required pictures that Flickr and have been connected to space in this way.
And it's possible to navigate this simple.
You know, I would never think of finish to work for Microsoft.
It's very free to get this kind of account here.
I think you can see that it's a lot of different types of framework from those of the MLR, a significant number of phones in this environment.
And if I can get there, I try to look for those more strangers.
Many are block to do it, etc.
Something here is a series of photographs -- there it is a series of photographs -- there it is.
This is a Notre poster Dame recorded right right record.
We can spend from physics to physics physics of this environment.
The essential point is that we can do things with the social environment. This is now taking data from everyday -- from collective interaction of how to appear the Earth, from visual view, from visual view -- and connects to all the data together.
All those pictures become connected together, the larger of the sum of the parts.
You have a model of the earth of the Earth emerge.
Think about this as a prolungment of Stephen Lawler on the Earth.
It's something that grows in complexity as people are using it, and the advantages for those who uses it increases it increases it increases with use.
Their pictures are marked with metaminserited by other people.
If you get the idea of delivering all these sants said my own name, my picture of Nots Dame suddenly is a suddenly arriches arrich of all of the data, and I can use it as a point of ingres-to-shift to that space, in that metaphor or or and have an experience of the type of red-cross-scale of all those data -- and I can use a social experiences.
Of course, a consequence of all these are extremely elaborate models of any interesting part of the earthly in the earthest part of the earther and seatellites and seatellification and the side, but from collective memory, but from collective memory.
You know, thank you.
Chris Anderson: I realized what your software will give us to do is that at a certain point, in the next few years, all the shared photographs of shared anybody in the world are going to be practically connected?
BAA: Yeah.
It's creating hyperlink, if you want to be an emphines.
And it's doing it in the content of the images.
And it becomes very interesting if you think about the rich of the semantic information that many of these images are going to be there.
As when you do a research of images on the web, you know, a fruiting on the web.
Now, what happens if that picture is connecting all your picture?
So the amount of semantic interconnection and the amount of rich interconnection is really enormous about it. It's a classical effect. It's a classical effect.
CA: Blaise, it's really incredible. Compliments.
BAA: Thank you very much.
One of the main pleasure when you travel and one of the initious research is the living between those who has not forgotten the antiquicked the antiququicked the past in the wind, touches it into the wind, touches it in in the wind, hits into the folding in the wind, and love the plants.
You think that the monkamans still over the Milky Way, or the Milky Way, or the Inuit the old myths of meaning, or that in Himalaya, the budying to remind the Dhar, to remind the importance of the Polure, to remind the central importance of the antiantiboboard, and the idea that the world in which we don't exist, but it's just a model,
the consequence of a particular adapted adapted choices that our stunt, has done, good or mal, many generations ago.
And, of course, we all share the essential tracts.
Everybody born. We all procreate.
We are subjects to start to be addressed to the remains.
We have to dead the inesorability of death -- so we don't surprise and balance.
We all have an art.
What it is the depending is the particular canzone, the rhythm of any culture.
Not matter that are the Penan forests of Borneo, or the Haiti, or Haiti, or the Haiti, or the desert Kenya Sepentries in Sepentrional secentertains, the Curander's Curander in the heart of the Saa.
He was my own own company in the desert a month ago, or a month ago, or a tallelevatory in the Qomolange, on Everest, the mother of the world.
All of these populations are teaching us are there are other ways of thinking about existing ways of thinking about it.
And if you think a moment, it's a concept that can give you hope.
Inside, the cultures of the world creates creating a spiritual and cultural life that goes the planet and cultural is important for the benefit is important for the benefit to be the benefit as a biosphase.
And you can think about this ran cultural as a cultural as an ethnoxfe and you can define the total of all concepts, dream of all the concepts, dreams, ideas, inspirations, ideas, inspirations, ideas, inspirations, ideas, inspirations, ideas, inspirations, as a human imagination from the the tree of the consciousness.
Eetnossnthothnoyis the fantastic potential.
It's the symbol of what we are and what we can be as as as a kind of quisities.
And because biosphere has been consumed as it as a biosphere was so much fast.
No biologist, for example, it would say that 50 percent of all the species was or on the east of the extreme -- because it's just hot, or -- in the most apocalittic ipots -- in the field of biological diversity -- and not approach to the most optimistic -- that of cultural diversity.
The indicates all of that is, of course, loss loss of all of the language.
When you were born 6,000 languages on this planet.
A language is not only composed to a vocabulary of gramatics.
A language is the price of human spirit is the price.
It's the middle with which animal of any culture.
Each language is a forest of the mind, a spiritual approach, an ecosystem of spiritual possibility.
And of those 6,000 languages, while we sit in Monterey, at least half of the time is not being sushed in the ears.
They don't get to teach children, the kids, the means less you shouldn't not be able to do something that they did.
What is it more sad than being the silency, the last to be the last to talk a language, of not having a way to transmimit the sad of the hall-up of the kid?
This is orring in a few part of the world every two weeks of the world every two weeks a laughter and brings with a smooth language.
And I know anybody who will say, "Is it better than that?
The world would not be a better place if we were all the same languages?" Benissue, then we talk all yoruba. Parlient of the same yoruba.
Let's talk about it.
You will be able to be able to talk about their language.
I love to do a journey through the etnosfera;
a little journey in the ethnosfe to give you a house.
Many of us forget that when I say, "different ways of existing -- I really mean, in different ways of existing
So let's take this little Barasana, in Amazonia secentrional, the population of anacony, which creates the military of anacony, which creates the military of the military of sacries.
It's a popular that it's not able to distinguish the blue color because the celest, it is identified in the forest of the forest, which depends the population of the forest, which depends the population of the forest --
They have a strange language and a marriage rule and a marriage of languages and a married make, "married a different language.
And that has radically roots in the past, the particular arity is that in these extremely extreme in the extreme that you're talking about six or seven lings.
They are limited to listen and then they start talking about.
Let's take one of the most interesting tribes with which I lived -- the Waorani Ecuador nordal, an incredible population that had the first contacts in 1958.
In 1957 five mission missionarized a facting,
They took them out of the photographs that they would get them into a few that they thought thought of a pluvial forest, forget that this population of the rain forest, he never saw anything than bi-dimensional.
They collected the pictures from the earths to the research of a shape or a shape and not find nothing, they have concloud that it was the diavold, and they killed the five missionaries with the lances.
But the Waorani didn't kill the straniera.
They kill themselves between them.
54 percent of the mortality was caused by their own themselves.
We are risalitites and we found two of natural death and we found two of natural death and when we put it to know one of them was so aged that they died in again again again -- and then they killed the itself.
Cels were able to recognize the animals of 40 steps and recognize the species.
In the first '80s, I was assigned a really interesting compit when my Harvard professor that I wanted to go to Haiti to intrufolded between the secret society to intrufolded between Duvaliver and the Tonton Macoutes, and the Tonton Macout, and the Tonton Macout, and impoisons.
to make sense of my myracology, I should understand the Voodoo culture and that Voodoo is not black black is black nera.
It's a pretty complex metaphor or or of the world.
Very interesting.
If I ask you to tell me the great religions of the world, what would I say about it?
Christian; Islam, Garm, Ebrism, Ebrism, etc.
A continent is always left out, thinking that sub-Saharan Africa has no religious ffaiths. And instead of didn't, and Voodoo is that the distilled of these very profound religious concepts,
What makes you interesting is that voodoo is the inth relationship between life and death and death --
So you see the spirits.
And the spirits can be invocated by Grande Acqua, they respond to the dance of dance, and they replaced themselves to the animals of the way that for a short actime-active to the follower to the follower active to become the dio.
So this is why you go to church to say, "You want you to church about God.
We get God's in the time and become God."
And from the time you are posseduced, is the spirit that you drive to you, you do that?
So you look at these incredible events -- I followed the voodoo in the trance that touch you get a fairly demonstration of the mind in the body when it was catalyzed in the body when it was catalyzed in an extreme state of extreme when they catched into an extreme in an extreme of extreme in a state of extreme in a state of extreme when you catch in extreme extremely get to these incredible event.
And in all the populations that I lived the most extraordinary of the Sierra Nevada Santa Marcuses in the Marcuses in the Colombia.
It turns out to the ancient civilization that once they lived on the cartoonds of Colombia in the conquist, the population of the conquist, the population of carry that was a vulchanical massive that was on the heart of heart please.
In a mackicated continent -- this popular has never been conquited by the shages.
And at all. And they are governed by a claim but their formation is completely extraordinary.
The young people followed by the family, and they live in a 3-year-old family, and they live in a world of good and shake up at the bottom of the ice for 18 years.
Two period of nine years choices to reproduce the nine months of management that spend on the utter of the mother, are now metaphors in the Grande Madre.
For this time, they get accultured to the values of their society, values that they have their prayers and only their prayers are the cosmic balance, or for the cosmic balance.
And at the end of this incredible initiation, they get suddenly and they get out and for the first time in the age of 18 years, they see an alba. And that active first bony belony when the sunnfashion the beautiful fair, when the Sunceld the gases of this is a step back back back into the splend. The precent is a past on to tell and say --
"Vist? I just detail.
It's amazing. Now it's going to protect it."
They call that the major brothers and say that we, the minors, we are the copiles.
This level of intuition is extremely important.
When we think about indeed indeed indeed and the environment we invote Rousseau and the old history of wildly -- it's a concept of racist in his simplicity or maybe we invote Thoreau and say these populations are closer to the Earth of us.
The Indian is not feeling or unsentimental sentimental or indebed by our algies.
There is no space for these things in the malaric paludes of the Tibet, but because of the time and retreats, they created a mystic of the Earth not the concept of being aware of being aware of that, but on an untouches -- but on an intuition of the most subtle subtle -- the concept that the Earth can live because it's not because it's a human consciousness.
What does you want to say?
It means that a girl of Ande who grow up creating that mountain is a foundation that will be a human destiny is going to be a human being being being a deeply different and it will be a very different relationship with the mountain or a Montana creation or that is growing up a mountain the Montana growing that is a male of rock that a mountain a mountain a rock that it's a she's shshop.
which is the dimora death of a spirit or a mineral core is irrizing.
What is interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between the individual world.
I grew up in the forests of the Britannica creating that the forests had been cut.
And that I resided me of a human friends from my friends who believe that the forests are the Hukukukuk's didrink and the spirits of the paradic and the spirits of the wild that live in the north of the world, the spirits that are living in the Huking's begins.
If you start to look at that these cultures can actually create different reality, you can start to understand some sensely sensational. We can start to understand that we can start to understand that plant.
I taken this picture to open up the nordocccident.
Maybe some of you have heard about the ayahuas, the most powerful supportsign of the repertoise.
What makes the ayahuas, is not the potential for the support is not the potential for the support, but its processing. It's made by two elements.
From a housing that lexide a series of beta-carboline, harmine and manufacing and manufactures.
And I take the only plant plant coffee that you have a fall-up coffee that you have a little bit of consciously, but it's measured with the sheet of coffee family, and viriddge.
This planta is powerful powerful poweres that triptamine-5, methoxyltryptamine-5, methoxyltryptamine-5, methoxyptamine-5, methoxyptamine-5, methoxyptamine-5, methoximy powerful.
If you ever see the Yanomami tiring on the nose support the support of the support of species, they are in a different set of species,
Tiring that polar on the hidden is a little bit like being disappeared by a fire of boots and land on a sea sea of electricity. It doesn't believe the reality of electricity. It creates the dissolution of reality.
I was often to my professor, Richard Evan Shultes, the man who scatened the psychopdelic, with his discoveries of the hallucinogens in the '30 in Mexico.
And in my text can be classified these triptamines because if you're made not telling anybody to be hallucinated because if you're made not to be hallucink because they are denounound, they can't be be sustained because they're denatured to be densely because they're denaturated monoyes.
You can just take them to the horally if you put them on other chemicals that denaturate the MAO.
Now is the beautiful beta-carboline that are inbats of the MAO, the same kind of required to potentiate triptamine. The question of triptamines. The question will avoes spontane: in 80,000 species of plants, how do these populations are they not sitt: but if you combine in this case, they think of a biochemistry, but if you put it in this part?
We use the great euphemism of proof of the proof of the proof infrutted.
But if we ask Indians, they will tell us "Well the plants are going to tell us.
What does you want to say?
This tribes 17 variety of ayahuas, which distinguished nitely in the forest, and that our eyes would come into the same species.
If you ask how they were doing their pocckle their pocckle they will tell us "Think I realized, "No."
The solution is: you take the 17 variety in a nightful night of the ground and each one will be with a different tone.
With this is not going to Harvard, but it's a lot more interesting to count the stams.
Now, [[applausi] the problem is that the ones of us that have heart people who have heart the margins are going to the sea in the sea history of our real world, and passes to the sea real world, and passes to the sea world of real, and passes to bear.
In fact, in the XX century, 300 years, it's going to be reminded for his wars or technology, but rather like the was that we stopped and delivered by the destruction of the Earth-accepted destruction of the mass of biological and cultural diversity of biology and cultural differently. Now the problem is not change.
All cultures through the centuries have been involved in a new chance of life.
And the problem is not technology.
Indians have not being Sioux when they put on the Soux when they put on the cock and fresh as Americans have not being Americans when they put on the horse and hot calculations.
It's not the change or technology or the technology that threat the ethnosfer. It's the power.
The harm fly of domination.
And if you give a look at the world, you will find that these are not destined to disappear.
They are living and dynamics, outside the existence from existence to identify their adapted adaptation that will be beyond their adaptation to adaptation.
I'm going to be disboxes in the pathric of the Penans,
a popular Next Sarawak, in the Souththwest asiic, a popular popular that the forest to a generation ago, and now reduced to the refashion red, and now reduced to the riverse of the river, you can see the fiffuck the required Borneo Cinese Meria, where you can see the river, the Japanese in the Japanese
ready to reach the staks with the bond wood,
Or in the case of Yanomami, are the diseases that have come with the discovery of the gold.
If we move on on the Tibet, where I'm doing a lot research, you'll see the hard flit flight.
As you can know the genocide the physical extinction of a population, but the destruction of a population, but the destruction of a population, not only is not just convicted -- but even celebrated in certain environments, but celebrated in the environments, because it makes part of the strategy of development.
And you can't understand the Tibet Tibet until you start to the beginning.
I have the 6,000 miles from Chengd's Chengdu in China China through the Tibet southwing with a young colleague, but only arrived in Lhasa young colleagues that we hear about it.
6,000 sacres are reduced in the polar and cenergy.
1.2 million people killed by military during the Cultural Rvolution.
The father of this guy was listened to Panchen Lama.
And that means that it was killed in the Chinese time of Chinese invasion of Chinese invasion --
Her is was fired with Sua Santity during the diaspora that led the population of Nepal.
Her mother was imprisoned and her she's been imprisoned and her shop,
It was brought up to the age of two years from hond to the age of two years from below her gonna because it couldn't live without him.
The sister that made the same thing -- it was in reedure.
A day he wrote a hot, a graduate fasolder Mao and this transgression, it was forced to be forced in the worked works.
Tibet of Tibet can be inable, but the request of the people are keeping it in the population is to be inable, but I spirit it represent.
And then it turns out it all gets up to a choice.
Could we live in the monoony world of the monotony or do we want to get the policy world of diversity?
The big Margaret Mead, we will be able to die in the world was said that his largest fear was that in our own vision love, not just we'll see the whole legal legal of the human imagination in the world's limitation of the human imagination -- but a day we wake up to a constant ant ant proption of thoughts.
And it's humiliating to recall that our species is existed for 600,000 years.
The Neoliter's revolution that gave us agriculture, which has made us satisfighting the cult of the seed-based degree with the classroom prose by making the classassroom, by making the classassassassassumption.
The modern industrialized world has to be 300 years.
That shark history, not suggests that we have the answers to all the challenges that we have to deal with in the millennia.
When the culture of the world is asked what it wants to say to be human, they respond to be human, they respond to 10,000 different voices.
And it's in these answers that we all risk that we all risk about being what we are. We are. And a kind of a kind of conscious optimistic account. And there are great optimism.
I taken this picture on the north North Ethwish image when I went to the Baffin, and this man, Olaya man, Olaya, he told me the wonderful story of his grandfather.
The government canadedese was not always gentlemen with the Inuit and in the '50s to our sounds our sucuses in colonies.
The grandfather of this man reflit to go out.
The family, I took all the arms, and all of his arms, and all of his attaction.
You have to know that the Inuit doesn't temt the cool --
The slicles were made of clay in the horigin caribs.
The grandfather of this man did not put it from the art of the artc or byylizing.
It's sunchested and he hit the pantalons in a focus and defected in their hand. When I did the pay of their hand. When I did it creating a lam.
It has shown salived on the points of the caccept and when I was solid, he killed a dog.
He brought the dog and created a brief, with the shoulder of the toraclit has created a slectured another dog and she's disappearing on the bankers, my sheking.
We want to talk about horse? [Ris] And that, in different ways, [Applausian is the symbol of the Inuit and all the the indeed population of the Inuit and all the the world's population of the world.
In the aprile 1999, the government canadese has released to Inuit for the larger of an area of land California and Texas I put together.
It's their new pathria. It's called Navut.
It's an independent thirdent. They she's all the mineraround.
One of the hplendic example of how a nation-state can reconcilit with his people.
And I think it's obvious at least of the people who have been in these remote areas of the planet, realized that they are not at all.
For somebody is home.
They represents of human imagination that reach to the dawn of the time. And for us all of these children, like the dreams of our kids, they become part of our kid's wisdodominography of hope.
Finally, we are National Geographic Geographic we are not going to get to anything.
We believe that polemicy --
[Applausi] are not persuasive, but we believe stories can change the world, and maybe we are the best institution, to tell the stories of the world. Every month our website.
156 countries transmit our television canal.
Our magazines are reading from millions of people.
Our work is traveling in the etnosfhere to bring our public in places of human cultural and cultural from which they go out to the central receipt, they will be able to be a central receiption of antibound: the world of existing in different world of different plurders, and we have to find a style in the world and multicultural wild: the world of an inherent life in a world and multiculture.
where the wisdom of all the populations can contribute to our well-being collective.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book I hope to call other than you have heard and I'll try to reach some links in the case you don't notice them.
I want to start with what I call "the official."
What's the official dog?
The official dog's official societies of the Western industrial societies. The official official of our citizen."
The reason is -- from a side, in the fact that freedom is in itself, it's very value, is useful, useful, useful, useful, human beings.
On the other one is that if we are free, each one of us can account to do everything that male our benefit and not no one deciding in the name of ourselves.
The way to male is to be the freedom is to be massized.
More people are free, more people are free, and larger is their freedom, more hand is their good, more good.
This is so deeply radicated in the society that nobody would be dreaming it in the society that nobody would be dream to put it in the society.
And it's also deeply rooted in our lives.
I'm going to show you some examples of what progress has required it possible.
This is my supermarket. It's not particularly big.
I afford a simple note on the unhealthy conditional conditions.
In my supermarket there are 175 conditions, without contacting 10 variety of olive and the 12 balloon and 12 balsamic haths you can buy you to buy a huge amount of conditional conditional conditional constance that no one 75 ready already already have a huge amount of condition.
Here's what the supermarket.
And then you go to the electronic store to buy a stere: CD, radio, reader, radio, plast, radio, plast, the legal pressure
And in this single electron store, there's a big audio.
We can do six and a half million different combinations using the components that there are in one negoties.
You have to admit that there is a lot of choices.
Some of the cam: the world of communications.
One time, when I was a kid, you could get all the wishes of the phones, to the pat the MMMMMMMMMMMM.
He was known the phone, you didn't buy it.
A consequence of that, in the way, was that the phone is that the phone is that the phone is that the phone is that the phone is that the phone is that the other, the phone is that the phone is that the phone is that the phone is that the phone is that the phone is that the other,
These times, they went to the time.
So now we have a rewards united by telephone variety of telephone cell phones, especially between cellphones.
Here's the future.
My favorite is that in the middle, reader MP3, cut up the nose of the nose and the belongst crase.
If you don't have seen it in the wild below the case, you're very well certain that it will be going to get it.
And what is the end happens is that people in the negoties, and said, "No."
It's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn't do too much things.
So, in other aspects of life that are much more important than water, you can be the same explosion of choices.
Look at health is: It's not happening in the United States you go from the doctor, and the doctors you have to do.
Instead, you go to the doctor, and the doctor, and the doctor, and they said, "B" "Betys," "Be's benefits and risk these risks. What do you want to do about?"
You say, "Dr. Dr. ♫ ♫ ♫ What should I do to do that?"
And the doctor, "In benefits and these risks, and Be's got these risks, and they are the risk and these risk."
"What you want to do that?"
And you say, "Dr. ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ What do you do?"
And the doctor, "But I'm not ley."
The result we call it ""malato," expression that makes it a beautiful thing.
But it's not that one to move the weight and the responsibility for some decisions to make decisions by somebody knowing something -- and almost certainly is sick -- and almost certainly is sick -- and so not in the ideal condition, to make the obvious decisions that the patient to make the patient --
There's a huge marketing of drug products -- directed to people like me and you think if you think it has no sensation that we can't buy them.
But if we can't buy them, why are they public to buy them.
The answer is that they want to do do do do do a doctor to ask ourselves to change the receive the recepty.
So that is a fundamental identity is a matter of choice, as you see in this way. "We don't want to force the baby. We don't want to force the right time. They don't want to be able to be forward.
And we can reinventate how many times us --
Which means that every morning, in the risking, you have to decide that kind of person you want to be.
I repted to the family, and a mathemselves of the family, a time perspective, smooted for anybody to do the most premise as much as we can get the most premise possible.
The only real choice was with which, not when you know, and even what to do later.
On day, it's really to play with.
I think I think about students very smart and I do 20 percent in less work.
And because they're not smart because they're not smart because they're less diligent.
But why are you implants, I mean, you know, do I mean, "should I get marries or no?
"Would I get married late? I have to think before you children or care?"
I'm all horrifires.
And they try to answer these questions, even if this implementing doesn't complete, the tasks that I asseat and not get a good vote to my exame.
And they really need to ask it. I'm questions.
Now, the job: we're lucky, like Carl subolineavy, because technology allows us to work every day, from the planet, except from Hotel Randpholind.
And in the parents, there's a corner, and I'm not going to tell anybody where the WiFi works.
I don't tell you why I want to use it.
What does this incredible freedom of choice that we have about the work? It's that we have to continuously decide to be continuously at every time if we have to work or not.
We can go to look at our kid play, with the cell phone in a poccket in a tail, and the notebook, typically on the knebook.
And even if they're all shots, every minute that we see our son roll, we also roin the title, we are asking this call?"
"Would I answer this email? I have to email?"
And even when the answer is "no," all that makes the experience of your son experienced a very different than what would be in other conditions.
So, from any part of the look, these little big, objects and style and style is a question of choices.
Obce the world was this: Obbblew up there -- it wasn't all about choices.
The world today is that it looks like this: The dilemma is it positively, or negative, or negative?
The answer is Scil response.
The positive lights all of them, so I'm going to talk about the negatives of the negatives of the negatives we know it.
All this choice has two negative effects on people.
The first one, paradoxicysetic is that it produces instead of freation.
With many options between the chooses, becomes very difficult to do it.
I'm offered for you an significant example of the volunteer floors of volunteer pensions.
A colleagues had access to the data from Vanguard, the giant society of the pension of the pension of a millions of clients in 2,000 different companies.
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are offered to do more, the percent, the percentage of air.
With 50 sources are about 50 percent in less than defense than when they are just 5. Why?
Because with 50 sources between 50 sources that choose -- it's sically hard decide, and choice is remainly to the question.
And I ask question, and I ask question, questions, and of course they don't get it.
You know that not just means that these people will be a song -- they don't have enough money, because they don't have enough money, it wants to say that decision is so obstate that they lose the fundamental funds of the workers of the dator workers of the data.
Not participation, they're loss to 5000-dollar data, which would be well willing to sell them.
So the paralysis is a consequence of having too many choices.
And I think it makes the world like this.
"And finally, for the eternity."
You want to make the right decision if it's for the right decision, if it's for the eternity, right?
You don't want to choose the wrong -- and you don't choose the wrong condition to the wrong conflict.
So this is the first effect. The second is that even though we can avoid paralysi, and make a choice, we are less soddiscised by the result of how we would choose to what you chood.
And this is different reasons.
One of these is that with many conditions between the which you choose and it's not perfect, it's easy, it's to imagine you might have done a different choice that would be better choices that would be better choices that it would be better than the alternative imagined us of choice, and the reflights the refalling sodance to the requires that decision of the decision --
even when it was a good decision.
More choices are -- more you disappeared to any detail, that is insoddisfacty option.
And then there is what economists call cost-opportunity.
Dan Gilbert has to be very well stamattine as the value that we give things to the things depends on what we conduct it.
Del rest, when there are so many options as we can represent the alternative characteristics, and being less soddiscised and be less soddisconnected to option that is choices.
Here's an example. I get me with all those that are not New York.
But that's what you would probably think about it.
There's this copy to Hamptons.
A place of slow.
Hunt splendid. Octima day. It's all for them.
It's not laughing. But what he thinks is -- it's Again."
"All my neighbors in Manhattan are alivia."
"I could park right at home."
And he spends two weeks that idea is losing -- every day -- the chance of parking where it wants.
The cost-cheap costs the soddisfation for what we have, when the choice was excellent choice.
And the more are the options that we have to look at the more than the features are going to come back against opportunity.
Here's another example.
This is a lot of things.
It talking about living the moment, and perhaps slowly.
But the most important point is that anything you choose to you choose to not do anything.
The things that we don't choose to these active attractive what we do.
Third point, exspiral growing for expectations.
I tried it on my skins by buying a new jeans.
Too jeans.
Once jeans were just like, you buy them and dress and dresss were swimmed -- they were smoked, and they were smoking them a lot of times, they begin to go well.
So, I went to buy a couple of jeans, when the old people went and said, "I need a couple of jeans, this is my cut."
The committed me fit, relaxed slim fit, relaxed up, relaxed there?"
You want to do a cerniera or with the bottonium? "Hed" or "acidd" or "aciddle hysth?
"You want it to be a lot of it?"
"Well you want to be hold or or close? Ble -- he was he was conflict.
I was over, and after a little bit of a little bit of a -- I could say -- I mean, I want the only one guy who was so so I tried all the time all of the states of the jeans, then I came out of the negoties, and I went out of the negoties, I had ever had.
It was the male of it. With all that I had the best.
But I felt worse.
Why? I wrote a book I understand it.
The reason I was worse is that I was that with all that choice my expectations were altis; they had to be perfect.
At the beginning I had expectations to do anything that was just a little bit of exceptional when it was only one of 100 different guys had to be perfect.
What I had watched was good, but not perfect.
After I had paragoned to what I tried I was insodly insodly in the expectancy.
The addition of options in the life of people do not to get the expectations that these have respect to the options itself.
And this will promise less soddisfation, even when the results are good.
No one in the marketing world if it makes it content.
Because if I know -- you don't know what I'm talking about.
The truty looks more than that.
"You were better when you were worse -- the reason that was better when you were worse is that when you were worse is that when it was worse was still to meet you can meet the soil of pleasure.
On the world that we live -- opulent industrialized citizens with the expectancy -- the maximity that we can hope is that things are at the expectations of expectations --
You never surprised it because your expectations to expectations -- my expectations are ingigantites.
The secret of happiness -- what you're here -- is -- "You know, you want."
I mean -- little authobiographic -- which are really married and my wife is really stupendy.
I couldn't do better, I don't have to do better, I don't have to do better.
But to get it to be a good thing.
And finally, a consequence of the buying a couple of jeans -- when you just have that jeans is that when you're not satis; and you ask you "Why?
Who is responsibles?
The world is responsible. What could I do about it?
When you have hundreds of jeans, and you buy a insoddisfacting, and you ask you who is responsible for you are responsible for you are you.
You could have have been doing better.
With hundreds of unsponsored variety of unsponsored variety of unable variety of unsponsor.
So when people are taking decisions, even though the result is valid, they feel insoddisdeded, and they make the hit itself.
In the last few years depression is exploded in the industrialized world.
I think a significant factor -- not the unique, but important -- this hondipressure is that people have deluent to deluent because standards are too high.
And when they need to explain this situation they think that the cut is them.
So the final result is that we are better, really, but we feel like it.
Let me let me reminds you.
This is the official dogma -- what we all take for good and it's completely failed. It's not true.
There is no doubt that a little bit better choice is better than it doesn't have any long, but from this doesn't have a lot of choice is better than a little bit.
There's a critical value, magical value. I don't know what it is.
But I'm sure we have overovercome, from a piece of the level where the improves improving our life.
Now, from political point -- I have almost finished -- from the policies, the nurse, the cool.
What it allows all this choice in the industrial society is the material rich of material.
There are many places in the world, and you know about that, in which the problem is not that they have too much choices.
The problem is that they have too much of it.
So the factory that I'm talking about is a mal, exclusive of modern and richest society.
And what he does to depress and angry is this: Steve Levitt told you about how much those expensive swarming seats are useless. It's a lot of money.
I mean that these choices, complicated and dispendioses, it's not just inuseless.
I'm even deleterious to be
They make worse.
If you have a little bit of what in our societies that we have a conversation in those where people have too much opportunity, it would not just be the life to improve but also the noaddress to improve it is going to improve it to improve it was going to improve
This is what economists call a paretyan improvement parety.
a redistribution of the redition is good at all -- not just to the poor -- because of this choice in except us to get up.
And to conclude it -- "Food, you can become what I want,
You know, people in culture, they think about it -- "What does that wei?"
"It's obvious that you can't make anything in a wthrote w."
"A falled" -- a limited vision of the world."
and I walk it like this, at the beginning.
But then, I realized that that fish the long time.
Because the reality of the fact is that if you send the mouse to the mouse the mouse of the freedom. You get the freedom.
If you break the mouse in a way that everything you can decrease the satisfation.
You get the paralysis, and you get the benefit to be.
Everybody needs a sphere.
This is almost certainly too closed, maybe even for the fish, and certainly for us.
But the absence of some symbolic symbolic symbolic symbolic symbolic symbolic symbolic symbolic symbolic symbolic sfe is a recipe for the able, of some symbolic symbolic sym
Thank you very heart.
