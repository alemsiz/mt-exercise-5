<unk> year I showed these <unk> to <unk> that the <unk> <unk> <unk>, which for almost three million years had the size of the United States <unk>, <unk> <unk>,
I'm going to do this <unk> <unk>, because it doesn't show you in the ice <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> is, in a certain sense, the heart of the <unk> of climate system.
It's <unk> and <unk> in summer.
The next <unk> will be a <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of the last 25 years.
<unk> <unk> are <unk> in red.
You see, you're seeing it until the <unk> <unk>.
That's the ice in <unk>, which is <unk> in summer.
You can see that the <unk> ice <unk>, five years, it's like the blood, which here <unk> from the body.
<unk> years, it's been in 25 years, so.
This is a problem because the <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> around the ocean, where there are huge <unk> of <unk> that, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, they're <unk> in <unk>.
<unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk>, that amount could <unk>, <unk> this point of not <unk>.
In some <unk> <unk> <unk>, the <unk> is already <unk> from water.
The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with a <unk> team <unk> <unk> with a <unk> team <unk> <unk> last <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>! <unk>: <unk>! The question is if we're also <unk> it.
That's a reason that this <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> from the north.
This is a river in <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> had never <unk> <unk> like that.
This is the <unk> river, in the <unk> of <unk>.
If you want to know how the <unk> is the sea level to <unk> the <unk> on <unk>, here is where it's where the sea.
These <unk> are <unk>.
<unk> on the planet: <unk>, the greatest <unk> of ice on the planet.
<unk> month, scientists have <unk> that the <unk> of ice is in <unk>, and that the <unk> <unk>, which <unk> on some <unk> <unk>, is particularly <unk> in <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, <unk> feet of the <unk>, like <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, the largest <unk> of ice, you see new <unk>, which a few years ago they were <unk>.
<unk> 40 percent of the world's population <unk> water from that <unk>.
<unk> <unk>: This is the source of the water <unk> of this city.
The <unk> is <unk>.
But when you <unk>, the same happens to the water itself.
<unk> California <unk> on the <unk> <unk> is 40 percent.
<unk> <unk> are in crisis.
<unk>, as you've read, they're <unk>.
<unk> <unk> in the world brings to a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> are <unk> to a <unk> outside of the normal and <unk>.
<unk> times over the last 30 years of the <unk> <unk>.
This is a <unk> of the whole <unk>.
If you look in the <unk> context, you can see the <unk>.
In the last five years we've been <unk> million <unk> of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million <unk> in the oceans every day.
Look at the area of the <unk> <unk>, from the <unk>, to <unk>, and both the parts of the <unk> <unk>, where there's a <unk> <unk> of the oxygen in the oceans.
The <unk> of global warming, together to the <unk>, which is 20 percent, is the use of <unk> <unk>.
<unk> is a problem, and <unk> is even worse.
The United States is one of the two countries with more emissions, together to China.
And they <unk> to build a lot of other <unk>.
But we're <unk> to a <unk> of the direction.
These are the projects <unk> over the last last years and some <unk> <unk>.
And so, there's a <unk> politics in our country.
<unk> <unk> and oil <unk> have <unk> million dollars in the last year to <unk> <unk> <unk>, which is a <unk>.
I'm going to put something --
<unk> <unk>, in <unk>, where I live, there was a <unk> <unk> billion <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
Maybe you can see it on the <unk>.
This is the second largest flow in America.
It's happened around <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> of one of the <unk> <unk> was this.
<unk>: <unk> â™« <unk> the <unk> is a <unk> and happy.
It's <unk> here in America, and we're going to grow our economy.
<unk> the <unk> is more <unk>.
It's <unk>, <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> it.
<unk>: <unk> is <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The biggest <unk> society on the <unk> is <unk> <unk>. This is his <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> <unk>: <unk> <unk> -- Al <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> -- they don't know what they're talking about.
<unk>: So the <unk> for the <unk> of the <unk> has <unk> two <unk>.
This is one of them, one part.
<unk>: <unk>: <unk> <unk>, we see the changes as a <unk> <unk> to our business.
So, for that, we're <unk> a big amount of money in a <unk> <unk> to make public and <unk> the <unk> truth.
In fact, <unk> is not <unk>.
We think it's <unk> -- it's also a good <unk>.
So we don't know about climate change.
We're going to do.
<unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk> -- you know, you've heard a lot of it.
So I <unk> a <unk> to the <unk> <unk> for how much <unk> <unk>.
<unk>! <unk> are a little <unk>, but that's the sound of the <unk> technology.
<unk> <unk> is between the main <unk> of global warming, but the <unk> technology <unk> that you see everything.
Let's look at this: this is the <unk> <unk> technology.
<unk>: <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk> to the economic issue and the national security <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>: <unk> America is in the crisis; the <unk>, national security crisis.
The <unk> that the <unk> all: our <unk> from the <unk> <unk>, like <unk> and the <unk> oil <unk>.
Now, <unk>, there's a new, <unk> solution to <unk> it.
<unk> America: 100 percent of <unk> energy, in 10 years.
A plan to <unk> America to work, <unk> more <unk>, and help <unk> global warming.
<unk>, one solution that we <unk> to solve our problems.
<unk> America. <unk> more. <unk>.
<unk>: This is the last one.
<unk>: It's <unk> energy to America.
One of the most <unk> ways of <unk> <unk> to the <unk> that we <unk> our planet.
<unk>: The future is here. <unk>, <unk>, a new <unk> network.
<unk> <unk>: <unk> <unk> for jobs.
<unk>: <unk> America. It's time to be <unk>.
<unk>: A old <unk> <unk> says, "If you want to go to, you go to the only.
If you want to go away, you go together. "
We have to go away, fast.
Thank you very much.
<unk> year at TED, I did an <unk> on <unk>.
And I'm going to try to <unk> it on how the machine works.
So here we go. And for those who was not, the <unk> is the largest scientific scientific experiment ever <unk> -- <unk>.
His task is to <unk> the conditions that were <unk> less than a <unk> from the beginning of the universe -- to <unk> millions of times a second.
All that's just <unk>.
This is the <unk> machine.
And they're going to be these <unk> <unk>.
This is what I work. It's called <unk> -- it's <unk> feet and it's a <unk> <unk>.
This is a <unk> picture of <unk> in building so you can see the <unk>.
<unk> <unk> last year we <unk> the car for the first time.
And this picture was <unk> by <unk>.
It was because of <unk> <unk> in control.
It's an image of the first <unk> of particles that had done everything around the <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, with a part of the <unk>, and <unk> particles inside the <unk>.
In other words, when you put that image the 10 <unk>, <unk> that the <unk> machine, which is a big <unk>.
I don't know if it was this to <unk> us more or this, when somebody <unk> on Google and <unk> the page was this.
That means we've had a <unk> impact beyond the scientific impact.
And we had a week later, there was a problem with the car, it had to these <unk> here -- these <unk> <unk>.
These <unk> <unk> <unk> when the car works in the <unk> of <unk>.
Now, the <unk> between you to <unk> the <unk> and <unk>, "It's not true. I'm <unk> too <unk>."
And they can do it because when they're very <unk> become the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
So, <unk> degrees <unk>, to a temperature <unk> to that the space between the stars, these <unk> can bring that <unk>.
In one of the <unk> <unk>, there was a <unk> <unk> in the <unk>, there was a <unk> <unk>.
So the <unk> <unk>, and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This was the <unk>.
Now, this is even more <unk> if you think that these <unk> <unk> more than 20 <unk>, and that you've been <unk> about 30 <unk>.
They have about 50 <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, what we did.
We <unk> them and <unk>.
They're now <unk> to their place.
And I finally <unk> the <unk> is going to be new <unk>.
We <unk> it, and we try to get the data to <unk> or <unk>, and continue so our <unk> to find out what the universe is.
Now, of course, in some way, these <unk> <unk> the <unk> of science and <unk> engineering <unk>. It's easy to <unk>.
I think that the fact that it's so hard, the fact that it's the value of things like <unk>.
I would like to end with the words of a <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, which, <unk> <unk>, <unk> of the <unk> experiments of the <unk>, his <unk> was Michael <unk>, he said, "No much <unk> for the <unk> of the <unk> that the ideas of science are <unk>, which are not <unk> in nature, that there are no <unk> in nature, that there are no new <unk>, and they don't have <unk> <unk>."
Thank you.
I want to start <unk> <unk> to when, from children, <unk> with <unk>.
<unk> <unk> like <unk> and <unk>, <unk> and <unk> and <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, actually to think and <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> to the way we're <unk> most of the world around us.
So, from <unk> <unk> from our <unk> with <unk> objects, together to my <unk> <unk>, and my <unk> <unk> <unk>, I started <unk>, and I started <unk>, and I started <unk>, "And if we use a computer, instead of having the <unk> <unk> as digital <unk> that moves on a <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with the information with both of the hands,
and we're going to <unk> and <unk>?
The question was so interesting that I was trying to explore the answer, building the <unk>.
In a few words, a <unk> is a computer <unk> like a <unk>.
In a few words, a <unk> is a computer <unk> like a <unk>.
You can <unk> them with the hand, they can <unk> them, feel their movement and they have a screen and a <unk> <unk>.
But <unk>, they're <unk> objects, like <unk>, you can just <unk>.
<unk> are the <unk> of a new tools to <unk> information to <unk> digital information.
And as they become more <unk>, <unk> of their movement, other, and <unk>, and as they become more <unk>, <unk> of their movement, other, of how we can explore new and <unk> <unk> <unk>.
I'll start with some simple example.
This <unk> is <unk> to show you video: if you put it in a direction, the video <unk> so, if you're going to <unk> the other <unk> back.
These <unk> are <unk> of other people.
If you <unk> them, you're going to <unk> what they're going to be around.
If they're <unk>, you <unk> it and they can <unk> a little bit.
If they're <unk>, you <unk> it and they can <unk> a little bit.
They also <unk> their movement and <unk>.
We've then realized that one of the interesting <unk> was the <unk> that we could be able to use <unk> on data, for example, "<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
In this case, we have three <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and I can <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk>, where they <unk>.
and I can <unk> to <unk> color in the central <unk>, where you're <unk>.
If we're too much, we can <unk> a little bit of place.
There are also <unk> possibilities of <unk>, like <unk>, <unk>, <unk> and <unk> <unk> where people can <unk> <unk>, and <unk> the results of them immediately.
Now I'm --
This is a <unk> sequence that I do with a <unk> program.
Here we have a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk>, to every <unk> <unk> <unk> a letter on every <unk>, <unk>, to every <unk>, <unk> <unk>, to every <unk>, and as I was <unk> <unk> <unk> on a <unk>.
Then, about 30 seconds, you get <unk>, and you have a new <unk> of <unk> and new possibilities to try.
Thank you.
Here we have kids in <unk> <unk> <unk>, I did the <unk> <unk>, I did that I <unk> them, and I <unk> a video.
They're very <unk>.
And one of the interesting things like this <unk> is that you don't have to give people a lot.
I just say, "<unk> <unk>," and they know what to do.
Here we are other people who are <unk>.
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, there is the right.
It actually wanted to <unk> it.
They were just <unk>, for him.
Now, this is a <unk> <unk>.
You could build a <unk> for the <unk> of the <unk>. He's <unk>.
It can <unk> new characters in the scene, <unk> their <unk>.
It can <unk> new characters in the scene, <unk> their <unk>.
That's, it's going to be <unk>.
<unk>: The sun is <unk>.
David <unk>: Now he's got a <unk> in the scene.
<unk>: The <unk> <unk>.
<unk> work! Yes!
So, <unk> the <unk> and <unk> can <unk> the characters --
<unk>: <unk>!
<unk> your story.
<unk>: <unk>!
<unk>: It's a story with the <unk>, and it can decide how to <unk> it.
<unk>: It's a story with the <unk>, and it can decide how to <unk> it.
<unk>: <unk> <unk>, <unk>.
<unk>: The last example I have time to show you is a device that I recently recently, to <unk> and <unk> music.
it's a device, <unk> recently, to <unk> and <unk> music.
The <unk> here are <unk> by <unk> <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> of these have four different <unk>, and you can <unk> what they use.
And you can also <unk> these <unk> in a sequence <unk>.
And I just <unk> a <unk> <unk>, and a <unk> <unk>.
These are actually actually that you can control the live, like <unk> and <unk>.
We're going to <unk> it to a particular sound and then you're going to <unk> it.
And then there are actually <unk> <unk> like time and <unk>, who are <unk> to the entire sequence.
It's going to be like.
<unk>: <unk> <unk>: <unk> <unk> a <unk> in two <unk> <unk>, "<unk> in a series, the <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
Now let's go a <unk> line.
<unk>: <unk>: Now, I'll <unk> --
<unk>: <unk>: And now I'm going to <unk> the <unk>, so I can control the effect from live.
<unk>: <unk>: I can <unk> the whole sequence <unk> the time on one side or on the other.
<unk>: <unk>: And now we're going to <unk> the bottom to give more <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>: I can <unk> the sequence.
So I don't have to <unk> before, but I can <unk>, I can <unk>, <unk> more or more <unk>.
And now, finally, I can <unk> the whole sequence on the left <unk> the <unk> <unk>.
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is to build new <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to how our brain works and body.
And today, I've had time to show you one of this path, and even some possibilities to try to bring out of the lab.
And the concept I want to <unk> is that's going to <unk> this new generation of <unk> objects to <unk> the <unk>, which we're going to <unk> information in our world in the way we want.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the time to talk to all of you.
I'm a <unk>.
<unk> books is my <unk>, but it's more of this, obviously.
It's also love and love and the <unk> of my life.
And I don't look like that.
But, I said, this, something particular has been <unk> in my life and in my career, who took me to <unk> the whole <unk> with this work.
The particular thing is I <unk> wrote this book, this <unk> called "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
And the result is that everywhere <unk> now, people <unk> me as if I was <unk>.
<unk> -- <unk>, <unk>!
I'm going to be <unk> and say, "You don't fear of you not more <unk>?
You don't get <unk> to write all the <unk> for life without being able to create a book that could <unk> someone?
that can <unk> to someone? "
It's <unk>, you know.
But it could go worse, part of that I remember, over 20 years ago, when I was telling people -- I was a <unk> -- I wanted to be a <unk>.
I <unk> the same <unk> <unk> by fear.
And people said, "Do you don't know that they could not be able to be successful?
Do you not have fear <unk> <unk>?
You don't have fear to do this <unk> for all life without anything else is ever out and out of the <unk> of <unk>?
So, you know.
The <unk> -- the short answer to all these questions is, "Yes."
Yeah, I'm afraid of all those things.
I've always had fear.
And I also fear of many other things that people couldn't <unk>.
As <unk> and other things <unk>.
But, as I was about writing what I thought and I was <unk> to me is why?
Is it <unk>?
It's <unk> that anybody who <unk> <unk> to be <unk> by a job that you feel born for doing.
But what's so particular in the <unk> <unk> <unk> by <unk> <unk> to a <unk> <unk> about a way that other <unk> do not?
How did my father, for example, he was a <unk> <unk> and I didn't remember one time in her 40 years of activity where the <unk> was asked if he he was to be <unk>?
There was never -- that <unk> of the <unk> John, how it goes?
<unk>'t you like that, <unk>?
<unk>, the <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> the <unk> of being <unk> <unk>.
We <unk>, we have enough this <unk>, and not just <unk>, but <unk> of all these <unk>, we have this <unk> to be <unk> <unk>.
And they're not going to look at the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that, only in the <unk> century, <unk> young people and often <unk> for their hand.
And even the ones that don't seem to be really <unk> by their <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, before he died, in the last <unk> said, "My book <unk> me a little more <unk> than" a <unk> <unk> about the work of your life.
But we don't <unk> to <unk> when we're saying, because we've heard these things so long, we have completely <unk> and <unk> the <unk> that creativity and <unk> are <unk> <unk> and <unk> are <unk>, and that art, at the end, <unk>, <unk> always <unk> to the <unk>.
And the question I want to <unk> all over here today is: you agree with this idea?
It's all right now, it's also going to be <unk> by a <unk> distance to me not that <unk>.
I think it's <unk>.
And I think it's also <unk> and I don't want to <unk> <unk> in the next century.
I think it's better to <unk> our big <unk> to live.
And I certainly know that, in my case -- in my <unk> -- it's very <unk> to start <unk> to that <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> where I'm in my career.
<unk> -- <unk> look, I'm pretty young, I've got 40 years.
I still have about four <unk> of work in me.
And it's very <unk> that anything <unk> in hour, it will be <unk> by the world as the work that <unk> after the <unk> <unk> of my last book.
<unk> <unk>, because we're all more or less friends here -- is <unk> that my greatest success is my <unk>.
Oh, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>!
You know this is the kind of thought that brings a person to <unk> <unk> at nine in the morning and I don't want to do that.
I'm going to keep doing this work that I love.
So, the question becomes, how?
And so I think, after many <unk>, that the way to work to write is to create a <unk> <unk> <unk>, right?
I have to get a distance from <unk> between me, which I'm <unk>, and my natural <unk> on which <unk> what <unk> <unk> <unk>. And while I was going to start to be able to look through the time, looking at the time, looking at other societies to see if you could have better ideas and more <unk> <unk> ideas and <unk> <unk>.
about how to help people <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity.
And that research took me to the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
<unk> because they <unk> and <unk> back and then <unk> back.
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> -- people don't believe that that creativity is <unk> by men, OK?
And it was <unk> that creativity was this <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> to men from a few <unk> <unk> and <unk>, for <unk> reasons and <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> these <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity.
<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> to have a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> were the same idea, but they <unk> the species of <unk> without a <unk>.
And that's <unk>, because the <unk> didn't really believe that a <unk> was somebody was very smart.
And I thought that a <unk> was this kind of <unk> <unk> that <unk> literally in the <unk> of a <unk> artist, a little bit like the <unk>, and that <unk> out of <unk> the work of the artist and <unk> the <unk> of that work.
<unk> <unk> <unk>: that's the distance from which I talk -- that <unk> <unk> you from the results of your work.
And everybody <unk> that was so that it was so that it was, right?
So, the <unk> artists were <unk> by <unk> things, like the too <unk>, for example, right?
If your work was <unk>, you don't <unk> <unk> the <unk>, everybody <unk> that was <unk> <unk> <unk>.
If your work work <unk>, it wasn't all your <unk>, right?
Everybody <unk> that was your <unk> to be a <unk>.
And so people <unk> <unk> creativity in <unk> for a long time.
Then the <unk> <unk> and <unk>, and all this big idea; we put the human being in the middle of the universe over the <unk> and the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> to leave space to the <unk> creatures that <unk> from the <unk>.
This was the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and people <unk> to think that creativity is <unk> by <unk>.
And for the first time in history, you're <unk> to <unk> to this or that artist as a <unk> <unk> to a <unk> <unk>.
And I have to <unk>, I think it was a big <unk>.
I think you're going to somebody, a simple person to believe that they're like a <unk> like the source, the <unk> and the <unk> of all the <unk> <unk>, <unk> and <unk> and <unk> is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's like someone to <unk> the sun.
<unk> and <unk> and completely the <unk> and <unk> the <unk> and <unk> all these <unk> on the <unk>.
And I think it was this pressure to have <unk> artists in <unk> 500 years.
And, if this is true, and I think it's true, and I think it's the question, and now?
Can we do that?
We want to go back to a more <unk> understanding of human relationship.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we can't <unk> 500 years of thinking in a 18 minutes.
And there's probably people in the audience who are <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk>, <unk>, you do the people <unk> <unk> <unk> on their projects.
You probably don't all about this thing.
But the question I would like to <unk> is -- why not?
Why don't we <unk> this way?
Because it's more sense of everything that ever ever heard to explain the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> process.
A process that, as anybody who ever <unk> to do something -- so, basically, all, you know, you don't <unk> <unk>.
And in fact, it can be completely <unk>.
I did this <unk> <unk> with the extraordinary <unk> <unk>, who has now 90 years, but that was a <unk> for the entire life and said that during his <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> out of the <unk> <unk>, <unk> out of the <unk> <unk>, <unk> out of the <unk> <unk>.
He said, he was like a <unk> <unk>.
And that <unk> <unk> to her from the <unk>.
I could get this, because he was <unk> the earth under his feet.
I was going to have one thing to do that point and was, he said, "<unk> as a <unk>."
And so he was <unk> to home and he was <unk> by this <unk>, and it wouldn't have to get somebody else that's a piece of paper and a little <unk> <unk>, and <unk> on page.
<unk> times I couldn't get enough, so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> the <unk> through and she would be able to <unk> through the <unk>, looking, as she said, "another <unk>."
And then there were those times -- this is not going to be <unk>. There were moments where it was almost <unk>, right?
So, he was going to home and he was looking for paper and the <unk> through, and he was going to <unk> a <unk> in the while he was <unk> with the other hand and the <unk>.
He <unk> the <unk> from the tail and the <unk> in his body and the <unk> on the page.
And in these cases, the <unk> would be <unk> on the <unk> and <unk> but <unk>, the <unk> word to the first word.
So when you <unk> it <unk> -- it's exactly <unk> to my <unk> process.
Not all my <unk> process -- I'm not a <unk>!
I'm a <unk>, and my way to <unk> is; it's <unk> to the same <unk> every day and work and <unk> on the top of it.
But even me, in my <unk>, I <unk> against that thing, sometimes.
And I think many of you the <unk> <unk>.
You know, even though the work and the ideas <unk> me <unk> me from a certain source I couldn't <unk> it.
And what is this thing?
And how can we <unk> it in a way that we don't lose your head, but, what, what do we do <unk>?
And as I <unk>, the best example I have is the <unk> <unk> <unk>, which I've been <unk> <unk> <unk>, which I've been <unk> different years ago for a <unk>.
And I'm talking about this, and you know, <unk>, for the <unk> of life was the <unk> of the <unk> artist <unk>, <unk>, <unk> these <unk> species of <unk> <unk> <unk>.
But then <unk>, he was <unk>, and a day while she was <unk> on a <unk> <unk>, <unk> everything for him.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>, and everything of a <unk> <unk> this little <unk> of <unk>, who's coming into his head as a <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, and the <unk>, and the <unk>, but it doesn't know how to <unk>.
It doesn't have a piece of paper, it doesn't have a <unk>.
So you start to hear this kind of old <unk> <unk> in him like, "I'm going to lose, and <unk> <unk> <unk> from this song.
I'm not quite <unk> and I can't <unk>. "
And instead of going to go to the <unk>, they <unk>.
<unk> the entire process and made something completely new.
I just <unk> the sky and said, "<unk>, you see that I'm <unk>?"
"Do you think it's going to write a song now?
If you really want to <unk>, you'll be a more <unk> moment when I can take care of you.
<unk>, <unk> to <unk> <unk> more.
I'm going to <unk> <unk> <unk>. "
And his process <unk> <unk> <unk> after this.
Not the work, the work was still <unk> as always.
But the process, and the <unk> <unk> that <unk> was <unk> when I <unk> the <unk>, the <unk> that outside he <unk>, <unk> that he was <unk> that it didn't have to be a <unk> and <unk>.
But I <unk> this <unk>, wonderful <unk> <unk> a conversation between <unk> and this <unk> thing that <unk> and <unk> <unk> that but it wasn't <unk>.
So, how I <unk> that story is to change a little bit of a way I <unk> and already <unk> me once.
This idea, I was <unk> when I was <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and I <unk> in one of the <unk> where we're all working on something and we're not going to be a <unk>, which is going to be the <unk>, that's going to be the <unk>, which will be the <unk> book.
Not just <unk>, just the <unk> book.
And I started thinking about <unk> this project.
But then I <unk> to <unk> that <unk> the air and <unk> us.
So I <unk> my face on the <unk> and <unk> my <unk> to a <unk> <unk> in the room.
And I said <unk>, "<unk>, what, we know, both we know that if this book is not going to be <unk> my, right?
Because you see me, I'm <unk> everything I have, I don't have to be this.
So if you want it to be better, you have to <unk> and do your part.
Okay. But if you don't do that, you know what, you don't know.
I started writing the same because it's my work.
And I would like to say that that I was <unk> that I've been <unk> to do my part. Because at the end is so, OK -- <unk> it's so, OK -- <unk> <unk> -- <unk> <unk> to the moon, <unk> and <unk> music that would <unk> on the moon, and <unk> <unk>.
And they were always <unk>, because the <unk> were <unk> and <unk>.
But every once a lot, <unk>, something <unk>, and one of these <unk> artists actually <unk>.
And I know what I talk about, because I know, I know, because I know that you've all seen, a <unk> like that.
It was like the time <unk>, and the <unk> <unk> through a kind of <unk> and it was not doing anything else else than the <unk>, like the <unk> <unk> before, but it was <unk>.
And suddenly we don't just <unk> as a human.
But they <unk> from the <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk>.
And when this <unk>, people <unk> what was, he <unk> him with her name.
<unk> your hands and <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, God," God, "
That's God, you know.
<unk> <unk> -- when the <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> the <unk> of the <unk>, you <unk> this <unk> with them and the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, which you can hear the <unk> or in the <unk>.
In <unk>, when a artist has done something impossible and <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> -- a <unk> of God.
And it's <unk> because we need.
But the problem is coming up the day after, for the <unk> itself, when you <unk> and <unk> <unk> that are the 11 <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's just a <unk> with great <unk> to <unk>, and maybe you never <unk> to that <unk>.
And maybe nobody <unk> the name of God still <unk>, and what does it have to do with the rest of his life?
It's hard.
This is one of the most <unk> <unk> to do in a <unk> life.
But maybe it doesn't have to be so <unk> if you're <unk> to not believe, <unk>, that the most <unk> <unk> of your being being from you.
But let me just <unk> you that data in <unk> from a <unk> source of this <unk> part of your life that you have to go to <unk>.
And, you know, if we think that, it's all the way it changes.
And so I started <unk>, and it's certainly how I've been <unk> it for several months during the <unk> of the book that I was going to be soon, the <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>
And what I have to continue <unk> when I feel like this is, I don't fear.
Don't <unk>. <unk> just your work.
<unk> <unk> for your part, any of your <unk>, any of that.
If your work is <unk>, <unk>.
If the <unk>, you're <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> some kind of <unk>, for one moment through your <unk>, then, "<unk>!"
<unk>, you do the same your <unk>.
And <unk>! "<unk>!" <unk>! "<unk>.
I think, and I think it's <unk> <unk>.
"<unk>!" <unk>! "<unk>, even for having <unk> love and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk>: <unk>!
And as you know, I've already talked about some of these projects on the human genome, what it can <unk> and the discovery of <unk>.
We're now <unk> a new <unk>, we started <unk> biology and now start <unk> to the biology and now start from that digital code, we're <unk> in a new <unk> of biology, <unk> and <unk> life.
We always have been trying to <unk> big questions.
"What is life?" It's something that many <unk> I think they have <unk> to understand different levels.
We tried different <unk>, <unk> to <unk> terms.
We're <unk> for almost 20 years now.
When we <unk> the human genome <unk> to go from the <unk> world of biology in the digital world of the digital computer.
Now, let's <unk> us: can we <unk> life, or create new life from this digital universe?
This is the map of a little <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, which is the <unk> species from the <unk> genome between what they can <unk> in the lab.
And we tried to reduce <unk> the genome to <unk> one more small.
We're able to <unk> a <unk> of the <unk> of about 500 that are here.
But when we look at his map, it's just <unk> to our own map.
<unk>, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can <unk>, one to the time, it's very <unk> that this can bring to a <unk> cell.
So I thought the only way to <unk> was <unk> this <unk> <unk> so that we could <unk> the <unk> to <unk> some of these questions.
And so we started the <unk> of the <unk>, "Can we <unk> a <unk>?"
Can the <unk> chemistry <unk> of doing these big molecules that we've never been able to do this before?
And, in <unk> <unk>, can we make a <unk>?
A <unk> is just a piece of <unk> material.
The speed with which we're able to <unk> life is <unk> to <unk> <unk>.
Our ability to write the code, instead, <unk> rather slowly, but it's <unk>.
And our most <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We've <unk> more than 15 years ago.
The process has <unk> a lot of <unk>, <unk> with a <unk> <unk> before they <unk> experiments.
But we found that DNA <unk> is very difficult.
There are <unk> of thousands of cars in the world that little <unk> <unk>, <unk> of 30 to 50 <unk> and it's a <unk> process: the more <unk> is the <unk>, the <unk> is the <unk>, the <unk> is.
So we had to develop a new <unk> to <unk> these <unk> and <unk> the <unk>.
And this was our first <unk>, <unk> from information digital <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's a little virus that <unk> bacteria.
We designed the <unk>, <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> a DNA <unk> of about <unk> <unk>.
The interesting part is when we took this piece of <unk> material, and we <unk> it in bacteria, the bacteria have <unk> to read this code and <unk> particles.
<unk> <unk> are <unk> by cells, they're <unk> back and they <unk> the <unk> <unk>.
I've been talking about with <unk> members of the <unk> industry that they have certainly <unk> this model.
They have more than you.
And I think that this is a situation where software can actually build the same <unk> in a <unk> system.
But I could do the bigger things in the big.
You could build the entire <unk> of the <unk>.
They are more than <unk> <unk> <unk>.
So we thought of <unk> in the size of the virus, so that we can change the <unk> to understand what the <unk> of a <unk> cell.
<unk> is <unk>, and if you <unk> information with a computer, these must be very <unk>.
When I <unk> this genome for the first time in <unk> the <unk> <unk> was a <unk> for every 10 <unk> <unk>.
We found, <unk>, 30 <unk>. If we're <unk> that <unk> sequence never <unk> to do that work.
One part of the process is design <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> with all the other <unk> of 50 <unk> to build smaller <unk> than <unk> together.
<unk> elements here.
You've probably read that there's <unk>.
<unk> <unk>: we have a <unk> code on four <unk>: A, <unk>, <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> of those <unk> <unk> together <unk> <unk> <unk>, and there's a <unk> order to <unk> each <unk>.
So we can use the code for writing words, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
What we did at the beginning was <unk>.
Some have been <unk> by the fact that it wasn't <unk>.
We designed these <unk> to <unk> simply <unk> with <unk>.
There are <unk> that <unk> them and <unk> them.
And we started <unk> <unk>, <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
At every step, we have produced these <unk> in <unk> so that we're <unk> to create a very <unk> <unk>, as you'll see in a minute.
We're trying to <unk> the process.
So, this seems to be the <unk> of a <unk>.
When you go to these <unk> much more than 100 <unk> <unk>, you don't get to the <unk> <unk>.
You get to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> biology.
So we have more <unk>.
<unk> of another <unk> called <unk> <unk>, which in biology <unk> to <unk> the DNA to <unk> the <unk>.
Here's an example.
This <unk>, called <unk> <unk>, can <unk> three million <unk> <unk>.
You can see in the <unk> <unk> as his <unk> <unk> is <unk>.
<unk> 12 24 hours is <unk> exactly like it was before.
<unk> thousands of organisms that are able to do that.
These organisms can <unk> completely.
We're going to live under <unk>.
I'm absolutely sure life <unk> in space, and you get <unk> to find new <unk> <unk> of water.
And so, I mean, NASA has shown that this happens.
This is an image of the <unk> that we built using these <unk>, just using the <unk> with the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> <unk> them.
This picture was not <unk> with a <unk> <unk>, but with a <unk> <unk>.
It's a <unk> so big that we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk>.
These are pictures that you're going to be a time of about six seconds.
This is the <unk> that we've done a little time ago.
They are more than <unk> <unk> code.
It's the biggest <unk> of a <unk> structure ever <unk> by man.
It has a <unk> weight to 300 million.
If you <unk> it with a 10 <unk>, <unk>, we're just <unk> pages to <unk> this <unk> code.
Now, how do we make it work? How can we <unk>?
Of course, by a virus is a game from kids.
It's a little more <unk> when you use bacteria.
It's <unk>, even when it's about cells as our: you can just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> another, which is basically the process of <unk>.
In <unk>, <unk>, the <unk> is instead <unk> inside the cell, but we have <unk> <unk> that we're able to do a <unk> <unk> of a <unk> cell to another and <unk>.
We've <unk> a <unk> <unk> from a species.
<unk> are different <unk> than men from the <unk>.
We've <unk> some <unk> <unk> in the way that you could decide what to this <unk>.
And then he <unk> it with the <unk> so that it <unk> all the <unk>.
And when we put it in the cell was <unk> and <unk> our <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, the new <unk> went into the cell.
And I thought I didn't want to go beyond, but we tried to <unk> more in there.
This is one of the major <unk> of evolution.
We found that <unk> species have <unk> a second or a third <unk> somewhere, <unk> in a <unk> thousands of new <unk> to that species.
So who think about evolution as one <unk> to <unk> that <unk> has not <unk> a lot of the biology.
And I'm going to <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> DNA.
The <unk> that was in the cell not <unk> one.
The <unk> <unk> we've <unk> it.
It's <unk>, and it <unk> the other <unk> like <unk>, <unk> it, and we <unk> with only the cell and the new <unk>.
It became blue because of the genes we've <unk>.
And in a short <unk> of time, all the <unk> of a species are you <unk>, and it's <unk> of all in a new species, <unk> on the new software that we <unk> in the cell.
All the <unk> are <unk>, and the <unk> are <unk>, and when you <unk> the code that we've <unk> you.
Now, this may look like <unk>, but we can <unk> the software, we can change things quite <unk>.
Now, I've already <unk> that here is not talking about <unk> -- but of progress from three million years and a half of evolution, and I said that maybe we're going to create a new version of the <unk> <unk> that we're going to create new <unk> <unk> species on this digital process.
Why do that?
I think it's quite <unk> when we think of our <unk>.
We're going to go from six and a half billion people to <unk> billion over the next 40 years.
Right to give one example: I was born in <unk>.
Now there are three people on the planet to <unk> in <unk>; there are four years.
We're <unk> problems now to find food, <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and a half billion people.
I'll even more <unk> to do it for nine billion.
<unk> more than five billion <unk>, over 30 billion <unk> of <unk>.
That means 100 million <unk> a day.
When we try to find <unk> <unk>, or any kind of process to <unk>, it's going to be a huge challenge.
<unk> we have to realize all the <unk> of CO2 from these materials that we're <unk> in the atmosphere.
And today, thank you to the <unk> <unk> around the world, we have a <unk> with about 20 million genes, and I like to think that are the <unk> for the future.
The <unk> industry only one <unk> about <unk>, and you think about how many different things are <unk> out.
Our <unk> here is <unk> data from reality, and our imagination.
Now we have <unk>, thank you to these <unk> <unk> <unk>, to be able to create what we call <unk> <unk>.
We're able to build a big robot that can produce a million <unk> a day.
Think of <unk> these 20 million genes or try to <unk> the <unk> to produce <unk> or <unk>, new <unk>, we can change, with a small team, and create more <unk> biology now that in the last 20 years of science.
And it's just a standard <unk>.
We can pick up the <unk> of <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This is a <unk> of some software <unk> that we're working on to be able to <unk> and design species to the computer.
Well, we don't know to <unk> them.
We know exactly what their <unk> code.
Now we're going to <unk> on the <unk> <unk>.
You saw that <unk> <unk> from the <unk> was an experiment.
We <unk> <unk> and third generation that we're going to be <unk> enough to <unk> <unk> or different kinds of <unk>.
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without <unk> <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the <unk> would be <unk> CO2 in matter before, we're working for cells, and we're working for cells that can reach to be able to get the first <unk> <unk> in about 18 months.
<unk> light <unk> with CO2 is a <unk>, but in our <unk> <unk> around the world, we've found different <unk>.
This is a <unk> that we've <unk> in <unk>.
<unk> in the deep ocean, about <unk> feet <unk> at the temperature of <unk> water.
They're <unk> by CO2 using hydrogen <unk> as a source of energy.
We're trying to understand if we can <unk> CO2, that can easily be <unk> by <unk>, <unk> that CO2 in <unk>, to drive this process.
So, we think that we could be able to <unk> what the question is, "What is life" is, we <unk>, we have the <unk> goal of <unk> the whole industry.
<unk>. If you can't do that from TED, where you can't that?
It's <unk> a main source of energy.
<unk>, we're working for using the same <unk> to create <unk> <unk>.
You've seen this year with flu, we're always back a year and with less when it's about <unk> <unk>.
I think what you can change, and we can change <unk>.
That's how the future could start to look <unk>, now, the tree of evolution, <unk> the tree, <unk> the evolution with bacteria, <unk>, <unk> cells.
We are so much to <unk> people.
Our purpose is to do so much to live enough to try to <unk> them. Thank you very much.
First of all, I'm going to show you, the <unk> possible, some work, some <unk>, the <unk>, which we've got to <unk> <unk> <unk> a year ago. This is <unk>.
It's a environment that you can <unk> is <unk> <unk> that you can <unk> is a huge amount of <unk> data.
Here we're seeing <unk> <unk> <unk> with a kind of <unk> <unk> and <unk>, for a fast <unk>, <unk> the images like we want.
And it doesn't matter how big the amount of information we see, how big these <unk> of data or images.
Most of them are common photographs, but this is a <unk> <unk> by the <unk> of the <unk>, and <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk>, and <unk> in the <unk> of 300 <unk>.
It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that you <unk> the <unk> of a system like this is the number of <unk> on your screen in any moment. It's also a very <unk> architecture.
This is a whole book, example of data, not of images.
This is the <unk> <unk> <unk>. Every <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk>.
And so it's about the text and not of images, we can do something like that, to actually see that it's a real <unk> of the text, not a picture.
It could be a way to read a <unk> book.
I'm not going to <unk> it.
This is an <unk> example. This is a number of <unk>.
Every big image is the beginning of a <unk>.
And it really gives you the <unk> and the beautiful experience of reading the real version of a <unk> or a <unk>, which is for nature a <unk>, which is for nature a <unk>.
We also did something with the corner of this particular number in the <unk> of the <unk>.
We've made a <unk> <unk> <unk> much more than what you use in a normal <unk>, and we've <unk> you from the <unk>.
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk>, you can see here.
Or other models, or even the <unk> <unk>.
And this really <unk> some of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of space on the screen.
And I think that this <unk> <unk> to <unk> and other <unk>, <unk>, not <unk> to be <unk>.
Of course, the <unk> is one of the most <unk> <unk> for this kind of technology.
And on this this is not going to lose time, if not to say that we have <unk> to give it to this field.
These are all the streets in the United States <unk> over a NASA <unk>.
So now we're going to do something else.
This is actually live in the Web; you can <unk> to see it.
This is a project called <unk>, which is <unk> two different technologies.
One is <unk> and the other is a very interesting research computer computer <unk>, a very interesting <unk> <unk>, a student of Washington, with the <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And it's live on the Web, <unk> by <unk>.
You can <unk> when we do this kind of <unk>, where we can go from an image to the other and have this kind of experience <unk>.
But the <unk> <unk> of the images here is actually actually a meaning.
The <unk> <unk> of the computer <unk> have <unk> these pictures together, so that they <unk> to the <unk> places that <unk> all <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> are <unk>. So you see the elements of the elements of a <unk> <unk> or <unk>, and these are all <unk> on the <unk> level.
I don't know if I've got time to show you some other environment.
There are some much more <unk>.
I want to go to one of the <unk> of <unk> data, and this <unk> from a <unk> <unk> of <unk> that we've done for the first time, I'm going to show you what's really the key behind this technology, the <unk> technology. And it's not so much <unk> looking at the <unk> that we've <unk> in the website.
We had to <unk> <unk> and <unk> and on it.
This is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> <unk> of kinds of <unk>, other <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk>. And so on. And you know, this is what's discovery is discovery to this model.
So, I'm all <unk> <unk> and they're all <unk> on the <unk> level in this way.
And it's possible to <unk> this <unk> way.
You know, I would never have thought of work to <unk>.
It's very <unk> <unk>, this kind of <unk> here.
I think you can see that it's a lot of different kinds of <unk>: from those <unk> to the <unk> <unk>, a number, <unk> together in this environment.
And if I can, I can try to look at those <unk>.
Many are <unk> by <unk>, etc.
<unk> here is a series of photographs -- <unk>.
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We can go from the <unk> to the physics of this environment.
The point is that we can do things with social environment. This is now <unk> data from <unk> <unk> from the whole memory of how to <unk> the Earth, from the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> all of that data.
All those pictures become <unk> together, more than the <unk>.
You have a model of the entire <unk>.
Think about this as the <unk> of the work of <unk> <unk> on Earth <unk>.
It's something that <unk> in complexity as people <unk> it, and the people <unk> it, and the <unk> <unk> for who <unk> the use.
They're <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> by other people.
If someone's the idea of <unk> all these <unk> <unk> the name, my picture, my picture of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of all that data, and I can use it as a <unk> <unk> <unk> in that space, in that <unk>, using the pictures, using the pictures of anybody else, and having a social experience, and <unk>.
Of course, a <unk> of all that are <unk> <unk> <unk> of every interesting part of the Earth, <unk> not just <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk>, but from memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I realized? What your software <unk> us to do is that at some point, in the next few years, all the photographs of them from anybody in the entire world's the <unk>?
<unk>: Yeah. What's doing is basically <unk>.
It's creating <unk>, if you want, between pictures.
And it's doing it in the <unk> of images.
The thing becomes very interesting if you think of the <unk> information information that many of these <unk> images.
As you do a <unk> of images on the Web, you <unk> a <unk> and the page on the Web has a lot of information about the pictures.
Now, what happens if that picture <unk> all of your picture?
So the amount of <unk> <unk> and the amount of <unk> that <unk> is really enormous. It's a <unk> effect.
CA: <unk>, it's really incredible.
<unk>: I'm going to be very <unk>.
One of the major <unk> when you <unk> and one of the <unk> research is that that we have no <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> in the <unk>, <unk> <unk> it in the <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk>, the <unk> <unk> of plants.
I think that <unk> <unk> <unk> still beyond the <unk> <unk>, or the <unk> <unk>, or the <unk> <unk>, or <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk>, or <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk>, to remember the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk>, and that the idea that the world in which we live in in the <unk> sense, but it's only a <unk> of the <unk>,
the <unk> of a particular <unk> of choices that our <unk> has done, good or bad, a lot of <unk> it.
And, of course, everybody <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Everybody <unk>. Everybody <unk>.
We are <unk> <unk>.
We need to <unk> the <unk> of death, so we don't <unk> and <unk> --
We all have a art.
What I'm going to be the particular <unk> of the song, the <unk> of every culture.
It doesn't matter what the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk>, or the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, or the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, or a <unk> in the heart of the <unk>.
He was my <unk> of a journey in <unk> a month ago, or a <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk>, on the <unk>, the <unk>'s mother of the world.
All of these <unk> are <unk> us that there are other ways of <unk> to think, other ways of thinking, other ways of moving around the world.
And, if you <unk> a second, it's a concept that can give you hope.
<unk>, the <unk> of the world create a <unk> of life and <unk> the planet, and it's important for the <unk> of the planet, as the <unk> <unk> <unk> as <unk>.
And you can think of this <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and you can <unk> the total of all the <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> in being from human imagination.
The <unk> is the fantastic <unk> of humanity.
It's the <unk> of what we are and what we can be as <unk> species.
And <unk> <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, for example, <unk> that 50 percent of all species was or is on the <unk> of the <unk> because it's <unk>, or <unk> -- in the <unk> of the <unk> -- and you don't even even even <unk> to the <unk> <unk> -- that of the diversity.
The <unk> of this is, obviously, the <unk> <unk>.
When you're <unk> <unk> <unk> on this planet.
A <unk> is not just <unk> by a <unk> or a series of <unk> rules.
A is the <unk> of the <unk> of the human spirit.
It's the middle of which the <unk> of every culture is coming in the material world.
Every language is a forest of the mind, a <unk>, a <unk>, a <unk> thought, a <unk> of <unk>.
And of those <unk> <unk>, as we're here in <unk>, at least half is not <unk> in the <unk> of the children.
They're not <unk> to kids, which means less than <unk> something, which is not <unk> to something, which are already death.
What's more <unk> than being <unk> by the <unk>, of being the last to talk to a language, of the last one, the <unk> of the <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of the children?
This <unk> <unk> was the state of someone in the world every two weeks: every two weeks: every two weeks, a <unk> <unk> and <unk> itself in the <unk> <unk> of a <unk>.
And I know that somebody of you say, "Is it not better?
The world would not be a better place if we all <unk> the same language? "<unk>, then we're talking to all <unk>.
<unk> <unk>.
<unk> of a <unk> thing is to say, we can't talk about your language.
And today I would like to do a journey through the <unk> --
a little journey in the <unk> to give you a <unk> of what we're <unk>.
Many of us <unk> that when I say, "different ways of <unk>," I mean, "I really mean different ways of <unk>.
And for example, this <unk> <unk>, in <unk> <unk>, the <unk> of the <unk>, which <unk> to the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's a <unk> that it's not able to <unk> the blue color from green because the green <unk> because the <unk> <unk> in the forest, that <unk> the <unk>.
They have a <unk> language and a rule <unk>, <unk> <unk>, "<unk> <unk>," You have to <unk> a person who's talking about a different language.
All that has <unk> in the past <unk>, but the <unk> is that in these families <unk> in which they talk about six or seven <unk> because of the <unk> <unk> no <unk>.
You're going to listen and then you're going to talk to.
And I <unk> one of the most interesting <unk> that I lived, the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, an incredible <unk> that had the first <unk> in <unk>.
In <unk> five <unk> have <unk> a <unk> <unk>.
They did <unk> by the top photographs that <unk> them in <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk>, <unk> that this <unk> of the <unk> forest <unk> never had seen anything.
They <unk> the picture from the ground, they <unk> to <unk> a shape or a <unk> and, not <unk>, they <unk> <unk> <unk>, and they <unk> the five <unk> with the <unk>.
But the <unk> don't just <unk> the <unk>.
They <unk> them.
<unk> percent of the <unk> <unk> was <unk> by themselves.
We're <unk> eight <unk> and we found two <unk>, and we found two <unk> of death and when we <unk> to know, they <unk> that one of them was so that it's dead, and then they <unk> it.
<unk> were able to recognize the animal <unk> from 40 <unk> and <unk> species.
<unk> years early '<unk>, I was <unk> a very interesting task when my <unk> <unk> to <unk> me if I wanted to go to <unk> between <unk> society at the base of the <unk> of <unk> and <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>,
And to give a sense of <unk>, I should have to understand the <unk> culture and the <unk> is not <unk>.
It's quite a <unk> <unk> view of the world.
Very interesting.
If you're going to <unk> the big <unk> of the world, what do I <unk>?
<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, etc.
A continent is always <unk> outside, thinking that Africa has not <unk> <unk>. And instead and the <unk> is not the <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> during the <unk> <unk>.
What it makes it interesting is the <unk> relationship between life and death.
So, <unk> do <unk> <unk>.
<unk> can be <unk> by the <unk> <unk>, <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> of the live in so that for a short moment the <unk> becomes the <unk>.
So, for this <unk> <unk> to say, "<unk>, you go to <unk> to the <unk> to talk about God.
We <unk> in <unk> and <unk> God. "
And from the moment that you're <unk>, is the spirit that you can, how can you get <unk>?
So, you're going to be <unk> to these incredible events: <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a rather <unk> of the power of the mind when it's <unk> in a <unk> <unk>.
And I <unk> all the <unk> with which I lived the most <unk> are the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, in the <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that once <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk>.
In a <unk> continent, this <unk> has never been <unk> by <unk>.
And today I'm <unk> to <unk> today, but they <unk> is extraordinary.
The young <unk> are <unk> <unk> from families to three or four years, and they live in a world world world in <unk> and <unk> <unk> to <unk> the base for 18 years.
Two years old <unk> of nine years ago, <unk> the nine months of <unk> that <unk> in the <unk> of mother, now are <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
For all this time, they're <unk> to the values of their society, values that they <unk> their <unk> and just <unk> their <unk> <unk> -- or to say the <unk> <unk>.
And this incredible <unk>, they're <unk> out and <unk> the first time, they see a <unk>. And in that moment of the first <unk>, when the sun <unk> <unk> <unk>, when the sun <unk> <unk> <unk>, when the sun <unk> <unk> <unk>, everything they have learned in the <unk> theory in the <unk> theory, all of the <unk> <unk>. <unk> does a <unk> <unk> and <unk>, and <unk> <unk> says, and <unk> <unk> <unk>,
"<unk>? I'll tell you how I said.
It's <unk>. Now it's going to be <unk>. "
They call <unk> <unk> and they say that we, <unk> <unk>, we're the <unk> of the world's <unk>.
This level of <unk> is very important.
When we think of the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> environment and the <unk> <unk> and the old story of the <unk> <unk>, which is a concept of the <unk> of us.
<unk> <unk> are not <unk> or <unk> by the <unk>.
There's no space for these things in the <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk>, but because of the time and the <unk>, they've made a <unk> of the Earth <unk> <unk> <unk>. But on a more <unk> <unk>: the <unk> <unk> <unk>. And it's a much more <unk>: the <unk> of the <unk> of the Earth's <unk>.
What does it mean?
I mean that a <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> <unk> the mountain is a <unk> spirit that will be a <unk> <unk>. And it will be a very very different <unk> and will have a <unk> different relationship. And it will have a <unk> <unk> that <unk> is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> to be <unk>.
which is the <unk> of a <unk>, or a <unk> <unk> is <unk>.
What's interesting is the <unk> that <unk> the relationship between the <unk> and the natural world.
I grew up in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that the <unk> <unk> to be <unk>.
That made me a human being different from my friends who believe that <unk> are the <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> that live in the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
If we <unk> that these <unk> can actually create different, they start to start to understand some of the <unk> <unk>.
I <unk> this picture in <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk>.
Maybe some of you have heard about <unk>, the most powerful <unk> <unk> <unk>.
What makes <unk> <unk> is not the potential of <unk>, but its <unk>. It's <unk> by two elements.
On one side, this <unk> <unk> <unk> that has a series of <unk>, <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
<unk> the only <unk> has a <unk> <unk> that <unk> a little bit of the <unk>, but it's <unk> with a <unk>'s family <unk> said <unk>.
This <unk> <unk> <unk>, very similar to <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
If you're going to see the <unk> <unk> on the <unk>, which are doing from a different <unk> of <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
<unk> that <unk> on the <unk> is a little bit like being <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a sea of electricity. It doesn't make a <unk> of reality; it creates the <unk> of reality.
I often <unk> with my <unk>, Richard <unk> <unk>, the man who <unk> the <unk> was <unk>, with his discovery of the <unk> <unk> in the '<unk>.
<unk> my <unk> <unk>, you can't <unk> these <unk> as you're <unk> because if you're done, you can't tell anybody to be <unk>. <unk>, but they can't be <unk> because they're <unk> by a <unk> that's obviously in the <unk>, <unk>.
It's possible to <unk> <unk> only if you <unk> with other <unk> <unk> that <unk> the <unk>.
Now, the <unk>: the <unk> that you find in this <unk> are <unk>, the same kind of necessary to <unk> the <unk>. The question is, in a <unk> of plants, how these <unk> <unk> <unk>. <unk> <unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. <unk> <unk>: how if they <unk> in this way, they create a <unk> <unk> that's <unk>?
We use the big <unk> of <unk> and <unk>, which can <unk> <unk>.
But if we <unk> to the <unk>, we <unk> "<unk>" <unk> us. "
What does it mean?
This <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, who <unk> in the forest, and our eyes in the same species.
If they <unk> them as they <unk> their <unk>, "<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>." And you know, I said, "No."
The solution is, you take the <unk> <unk> in a night night with a <unk> <unk>.
And so that you don't <unk>, but it's much more interesting than <unk> <unk>.
Now, <unk> the problem is that even those of us who have heart <unk> <unk> them are <unk>, but somehow <unk> to the <unk> of the history of respect to our real world, and over.
In fact, the <unk> century, in 300 years, not <unk> <unk> for his <unk> or his <unk> <unk>, but rather as the <unk> was we've <unk> and <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of diversity and <unk> and <unk> the planet. Now the problem is not the change.
All the <unk> through the <unk> have been <unk> in a <unk> for new possibilities of life.
And the problem is not technology.
<unk> <unk> have no <unk> to be <unk> when they put <unk> <unk> and <unk> like that <unk> don't have <unk> to be <unk> when they put <unk> and <unk>.
It's not the change or technology that <unk> the <unk> of <unk>. It's the power.
The <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And if you look at the world, I'll see that these are not <unk> <unk>.
They're <unk> creatures and <unk> out of the existence of <unk> forces that go beyond their ability to <unk>.
And I think it's going to be <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> --
a <unk> <unk> <unk>, in <unk> <unk>, a <unk> that has been <unk> in the forest to a generation ago, and now we're going to <unk> and <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>,
We're going to <unk> the <unk> with the forest.
Or, in the <unk>, are the diseases that are <unk> with the <unk> discovery of the <unk>.
If you're going to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk>, where I'm doing a lot of research, you'll see the <unk> <unk> of politics.
As a <unk>, the <unk> physics, is <unk> <unk>, it's <unk> to the <unk> level, but the <unk>, the <unk> of the <unk> of a <unk>, not just <unk>, but <unk> <unk> in certain <unk>, because it's part of the developing <unk>.
And you can't understand the <unk> of the <unk> until you go from the beginning.
I <unk> miles from <unk> in the <unk> China through the <unk> <unk>, <unk> to <unk> with a young <unk>, but only <unk> to <unk> it.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> million people <unk> from the <unk> during the <unk> <unk>.
The father of this guy was <unk> to the <unk> <unk>.
And that means that it's been <unk> to the <unk> of Chinese <unk>.
<unk> <unk> is <unk> with <unk> <unk> during the <unk> that led to the <unk> in <unk>.
My mother was <unk> and his <unk> was to be <unk>.
It was taken to <unk> <unk> at age of two years <unk> under his <unk> because he couldn't have to live without him.
The <unk>, who did the same, was <unk> in <unk> field.
A day has <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> and, for this <unk>, was <unk> to the <unk> <unk> <unk> for seven years.
The <unk> of the <unk> can be <unk>, but the <unk> of the <unk> is from present.
And then, everything <unk> to a choice.
Do we live in the world's <unk> or we want to <unk> the world's <unk>?
The big <unk> <unk> <unk>, before he died, he died, he said that his greatest fear was that, in our <unk> to go to this <unk> view of the world, not just <unk> the whole <unk> of the imagination of the human imagination <unk> to a <unk> <unk> that there were other possibilities.
And it's <unk> that our species is <unk> for <unk> years.
The <unk> <unk>, who gave us <unk>, which has <unk> us to <unk> <unk>, and we talk about <unk>, <unk> the <unk> of the <unk>, creating the <unk> of <unk>, and we talk about <unk> years ago.
The <unk> world has <unk> 300 years.
That <unk> story, I don't know that we have the answers to all the challenges that we could <unk> in the <unk>.
When these <unk> <unk> of the world is asked what it means to be human, <unk> with <unk> different <unk>.
And it's in these answers that we all <unk> the possibility of being what we are: sort of <unk>, that it has to be, all the <unk> and all the <unk> can <unk>. And there are great moments of <unk>.
I <unk> this picture on the North <unk>, when I went to <unk> <unk> with <unk>, and this man, <unk>, and this man, <unk>, <unk> me the wonderful story of his <unk>.
The government <unk> has not always <unk> with the <unk> <unk> and in the '<unk> to <unk> our <unk>, we <unk> them in <unk>.
The <unk> of this man is <unk>.
The family, <unk> for his life, the <unk> <unk> all the <unk>, and all his <unk>.
You want to know that <unk> don't <unk> the cold, <unk>.
The <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> of this man didn't <unk> from night or <unk> <unk>.
It's <unk>, it's <unk> the <unk> in the <unk> <unk> and <unk>. When I did it <unk>, he <unk> it, he <unk> it <unk> it <unk>, he <unk> it <unk> it.
He <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk> of <unk> and when <unk> <unk>, <unk> a dog.
He <unk> the dog and created a <unk>, with the <unk> <unk> <unk> created a <unk>, has <unk> another dog and it's <unk> on the <unk>, <unk> <unk> in <unk>.
Do you want to talk to anything? [<unk>] And that, in different ways, [<unk>] is the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and all the <unk> of the world.
<unk> <unk> <unk> the government <unk> <unk> to the total <unk> of an area of <unk> <unk> <unk> of California and <unk> together.
It's their new <unk>. It's called <unk>.
It's a <unk> <unk>. It's going to <unk> all the <unk> resources.
One <unk> of how a <unk> can <unk> with his <unk>.
And, finally, I think it's pretty <unk> at least to who's been in these <unk> <unk> <unk> on the planet, <unk> that they don't <unk> at all.
For someone's home.
<unk> <unk> of the human imagination that <unk> to the <unk> of the time. And for all of us, the dreams of these children, as the dreams of the <unk> of the hope.
And finally, we <unk> <unk> <unk>, we're <unk> that <unk> <unk> never <unk>.
I think that <unk> --
They <unk> are not <unk>, but we believe that stories can change the world, and maybe we're the best <unk> to tell the stories of the world. Every month our <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>: <unk> our <unk> <unk>.
Our <unk> are <unk> by millions of people.
Our work is <unk> in <unk> to bring our public in places of <unk> <unk> <unk> from which <unk> <unk> from which <unk> <unk> from how much they saw and <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> in diversity, and we need to find a <unk> in a world of <unk> and <unk>.
where all the <unk> of all the <unk> can <unk> our <unk>.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope you've already heard and <unk> to <unk> some <unk>, in the case you don't <unk> them.
I want to start with what I call "the <unk> <unk>."
The <unk> <unk> of what?
The <unk> <unk> of all the <unk> society. The <unk> <unk> <unk>: "If we want to <unk> the <unk> of our citizens." The way to do that is <unk> the <unk>. "
The reason is, on one side, in fact that the freedom is <unk>, it's <unk>, it's useful, <unk> for humans.
And then, on the other one is in fact that if we're <unk>, each of us can act to do all of what we <unk> our <unk>, without no one that's going to be in our <unk>.
The way to <unk> the freedom is to <unk>.
More choices people, more choices are <unk>, and more they are <unk>, and more they're <unk>, the <unk>, it's their <unk>.
This, <unk>, it's so <unk> <unk> in society that nobody's <unk> in <unk>.
And it's also <unk> <unk> in our lives.
I'm going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible.
This is my <unk>. It's not particularly big.
I <unk> a simple note on the <unk> to <unk>.
In my <unk>, there are <unk> <unk>, <unk> the 10 <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that you can buy a huge number of <unk> in the <unk> that you can buy one huge number of <unk> in the <unk> <unk> that nobody of the <unk> already is <unk>.
That's what <unk> is.
Then you go to the <unk> store <unk> to buy a <unk>: <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
And in this <unk> store, there's a big number of <unk> <unk>.
We can do six million different <unk> using the <unk> that there are a <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> that there is <unk>.
<unk> <unk>: the world of <unk>.
Once, when I was a child, you could get all the <unk> <unk>, <unk> that were <unk> by <unk> <unk>.
You <unk> the phone, you don't <unk> it.
And a <unk> of that, by the other one, was that the phone you never <unk>.
These days they went to.
We have a <unk> <unk> <unk>, especially between phones.
Here are the cell phones.
My <unk> is in the <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, and <unk> for the <unk> <unk>.
If you don't have yet seen in the <unk> <unk>, you're <unk> <unk>.
And what at the end is that people <unk> into the <unk> and it does this question. You know, what's the answer is, "Is it <unk>?" No. "
It's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn't make things.
So, in other <unk> of life that are much more important than <unk>, you know, the same <unk> of choices.
<unk> <unk>: It doesn't happen in the United States you're going to be <unk> and the <unk> you're going to do.
Instead, I'm going to <unk>, and the <unk> says, "OK, we could do." And you have these <unk> and these <unk>. "And these <unk>," <unk> has these <unk> and these <unk>. What do you want to do? "
You <unk> them, "<unk>, what do?"
And the <unk> says, "<unk> has these <unk> and these <unk>, and <unk> has these <unk> and these <unk>."
"What do you want to do?"
And you say, "<unk> if she was me, what would you like?"
And the <unk> said, "But I'm not her."
The <unk> we call it "<unk> <unk>," <unk> <unk>, <unk> that makes it look like a nice thing.
But actually it's not that a <unk> the weight and the responsibility to make decisions from someone who knows something, <unk> the <unk>, to <unk> the <unk>, to <unk> <unk> -- and it's not <unk> -- and so it's not the <unk> to make decisions that the patient.
There's a huge <unk> of <unk> products, <unk> to people like me and you, that if you think of it doesn't have any sense, because we can't <unk>.
But if we can't <unk>, why do we <unk> them?
The answer is they want to <unk> that we call the <unk> to <unk> the <unk>.
<unk> of how much it is our <unk> <unk> is a matter of choice, how you see in this <unk>. "We don't want to <unk> the children. We don't want to <unk> the children. <unk> the right now.
And we can <unk> how many times we <unk>.
And that means that every <unk>, you have to decide that kind of person you want to be.
<unk> to the family and the <unk>, a time, the common perspective, <unk> almost to anybody, was that was that you <unk> the <unk> as soon as possible, and they could get the <unk> as possible.
The only real choice was with who, not when, and not even what to do after.
<unk>, everything is really to play.
They're going to be very smart, and they <unk> them 20 percent less than a time.
And not because they're <unk>, not because they're not <unk>.
But why I'm <unk>, I'm <unk>, "<unk> <unk> or not? <unk> it?"
"<unk> <unk> later?" I have to think before the kids or to career? "
They're <unk> <unk>.
And they try to <unk> these questions, even though this <unk> doesn't <unk> the <unk> that you don't get a good <unk> to my <unk>.
And they really have to do that. They're important questions.
Now, the work: we're <unk>, as <unk> <unk>, because technology allows us to work every minute, every day, every day, from every day of the planet, <unk> that from the <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, there's a <unk>, and I'm not going to tell anybody, where the <unk> works.
I'm not going to tell you, because I want to use it.
What does that mean, this incredible freedom to choice that we have about the work? Is it we need to decide, <unk> in every moment, if we have to work or not.
We can go to see our child <unk>, with the cell phone in a <unk>, the <unk> in the other, and the <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, on the <unk>.
And even though I'm all <unk>, every minute that we see our son, <unk> the <unk>, we're also <unk>, "<unk> to this call?"
"Do I have to <unk> this <unk>?"
And even when the answer is, "not," that makes it a very different experience of your child, very different than what would be in other conditions.
So, from any part of them, look, little and big things, and <unk>, life is a matter of choices.
Once the world was this: <unk>, there were some possibilities, but not everything was a question of choice.
The world of today is <unk> to this: <unk> is, "Is it a <unk> thing, or <unk>?"
The answer is <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> are all about, so I'm going to talk about <unk> <unk>.
I'm going to be able to do this choice, two effects of people.
The first, <unk>, is that it <unk> instead of <unk>.
With a lot of <unk> between which you choose, it becomes very difficult to do it.
So, let me give you an <unk> example, a study <unk> <unk>.
A <unk> <unk> <unk>, with a <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, with about a million <unk> <unk> in different <unk> companies.
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are <unk> in more, the <unk> <unk>, the <unk> of <unk> <unk> of two percent.
With 50 <unk> <unk>, there's 10 percent less than <unk> than when they're <unk> available. Why?
Because with 50 <unk> <unk> that you have to <unk>, and <unk> it's <unk> to decide, and choice is <unk>.
And <unk>, and still <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and of course <unk>, and of course <unk> <unk> never comes.
And I think it doesn't just mean that these <unk> <unk> <unk> food to <unk> because they don't have enough money, it also wants to say that the decision is so <unk> that it also <unk> the decision of the work <unk>.
They're not going to be <unk> to <unk> <unk> for a year from <unk> <unk> to work, which would be very <unk> to <unk>.
So, the <unk> is a <unk> of having <unk> choices.
And I think it's going to be the world like that.
And finally, to end, for <unk>: <unk>, <unk> or <unk>?
You know, you know, if it's for the <unk>, right?
You don't want to pick the wrong end, and you get the wrong <unk>.
So this is the first effect. The second is that even though we can <unk> the <unk> and make a choice, at the end, we're less <unk> by the result of how you have <unk> states with <unk>.
And that's why I think about different reasons.
One of them is that with many <unk> of which <unk>, if you could have one and not perfect, it's not perfect, it's easy to imagine that I could make a different choice that would be better. And what happens is that the <unk> <unk> <unk> us to <unk> <unk> from the decision,
And even when it was a <unk> decision.
More choices, you have, more choices is to <unk> than <unk> <unk>.
<unk>, there's what <unk> call.
Dan <unk> has <unk> very well <unk> as as the value we give to things from what we're <unk>.
<unk>, when you get a lot of <unk> possible, it's easy to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> and being less than the <unk> <unk>.
Here's an example. I'm going to <unk> with all the ones that I'm not in New York.
But that's probably what you're probably going to happen.
There's this <unk> to the <unk>.
A place of <unk>.
<unk> <unk>. <unk> day. It's all about them.
<unk> nothing. But what he thinks is, "Well, <unk>, it's <unk>."
"All my <unk> <unk> are away."
"<unk> <unk> <unk> right in front of home."
And it's going to be two weeks from the idea that's going to be <unk>, <unk> where it wants.
The <unk> <unk> <unk> for what we have, even when the choice was <unk>.
And the more are the <unk> that we have <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk> us to <unk>.
Here's another example.
This <unk> tells us a lot of things.
We talk about living the moment, and maybe a living slowly.
But the most important point is that anything you want, you to <unk> not to the other.
The things that don't <unk> have a lot of <unk> that can make less <unk> what we do.
<unk> <unk>: <unk> <unk>.
I tried to my skin <unk> a new <unk>.
They're <unk> almost always <unk>.
Once the <unk> were one of the <unk>, they <unk> them and <unk>, they were <unk>, only after <unk> <unk> a life and <unk> a lot of times, they were <unk>, just after <unk> a life, and it was going to go well.
So, I went to <unk> a couple of <unk> when the <unk> were gone, and I said, "I need a couple of <unk>, this is my <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> said, "Do you want to <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>?"
Do you want them to <unk> or <unk>?
"Do them want to <unk>?"
"<unk> <unk> them or <unk>? <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> --" <unk> to <unk>.
I was <unk>, and after a little <unk>, and after a little bit, I want the guy who was the only guy. "He had no idea what was, so for a hour. I <unk> all the <unk> <unk> <unk>, then <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, with the best of <unk> I had ever had.
It was the <unk>. With all that choice I had <unk> the best.
But I'll get worse.
Why? I've written a whole book for <unk>.
The reason I was worse is that with all that choice my <unk> were <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And I had <unk> <unk>. I didn't know anything about <unk> when I was only one guy, but when I had a different guy, <unk> had to be perfect.
What I had <unk> was good, but not perfect.
After I <unk> that I was <unk> in <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> in life of people don't make the <unk> that these are <unk> to <unk> the <unk> themselves.
And this is less <unk>, even when the results are good.
<unk> in the world of <unk> if they realize it.
Because if I <unk> it, I'm not talking about what I'm talking about.
The truth <unk> to this.
"It was better when you're worse," The reason you know, "The reason you know, it's worse than when you were even even <unk> <unk>.
<unk>, in the world that we live in -- <unk>, <unk> citizens with the <unk> of the <unk> -- the <unk> that we can <unk> is that things are <unk> to the <unk>.
You've never ever ever <unk> because your <unk>, my <unk>, <unk>, my <unk>, <unk>,
The <unk> of happiness -- what you're here -- is, "<unk> <unk>" Yes, you want it. "
I mean, I'm a little bit <unk> -- that I'm really <unk> and my wife is really <unk>.
I couldn't do better, I didn't <unk>.
But <unk> not always a <unk> thing.
<unk>, a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> when there's just that kind of <unk> is that when you're <unk>, and you're <unk>, "Why?"
"Who's <unk>?" The answer is <unk>.
The world is the <unk>. What could I do?
When you have hundreds of <unk>, and you get one <unk>, and you'll <unk> one <unk>, and you'll <unk> who's the <unk>, it's clear that the <unk> you are.
They could do better.
With hundreds of <unk> <unk>, there are no <unk> for the <unk>.
So when people make decisions, even though the result is <unk>, they <unk> and they give them them them to themselves.
In the last years, the <unk> is <unk> in the <unk> world.
I think that a <unk> <unk> -- not the only, but important -- of this <unk> <unk> is that people have experiences because the standard are too <unk>.
And when they have to <unk> this situation think that <unk> is they think that they're <unk>.
So the final result is that we're in general, we're better, but we're going to get worse.
Let me show you.
This is the <unk> <unk>, what we're all going to take for good and it's completely <unk>. It's not true.
There's no <unk> that a little choice is better than <unk>, but it's not a lot better better than that that we don't have much more than that much choice is better than a little bit.
There's a <unk> value, <unk>. I don't know what it is.
But I'm quite sure we've been <unk> by a piece of the level where the choices we <unk> our lives.
Now, from a <unk> <unk> -- I've done -- from a <unk> point of view, <unk> is the <unk>.
What allows all this choice in <unk> society is the <unk> material.
There are many places in the world, and you know, <unk> <unk>, where the problem is not they have <unk> choice.
The problem is that they have too much <unk>.
So, the <unk> I'm talking about is a <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> society.
And what it does and <unk> and <unk> is this: <unk> <unk> <unk> to you yesterday about how much those <unk> and <unk> <unk> to <unk> are <unk>. It's a <unk> of money.
I mean, these choices, <unk> and <unk>, it's not that they're just <unk>.
They're <unk> <unk>.
They do worse.
If a little bit of what we're in our society allows choice to be <unk> in those where people have too much <unk>, it would not be just their life, but also our <unk>.
This is what the <unk> call a <unk> <unk>.
A <unk> of the income is good to all -- not just the poor -- because of this choice in <unk> that we're <unk>.
And to end, "<unk>, you can become what you want --
<unk>, people of culture, <unk>, "What do that fish?"
"It's <unk> that you can't get anything in a <unk> of glass."
"A <unk> <unk>, a <unk> view of the world --
and I <unk> it so, I <unk> it, at the beginning.
But then, <unk>, instead, I realized that that the <unk> knows that that fish know.
Because the reality is that if you <unk> the <unk>, so that it's actually possible to <unk> the <unk>, so that it's not <unk>.
If you <unk> the <unk> so that everything you could <unk> the <unk>.
<unk> the <unk>, and <unk> <unk>.
Everybody needs a <unk>.
This is almost certainly too <unk>, maybe even for the fish, and certainly for us.
But the <unk> of some <unk> <unk> is a <unk> for <unk> and, for the <unk>.
Thank you so much.
