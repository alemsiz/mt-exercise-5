I showed these slide last year I showed these slide to show that the artical totype, which for for almost three million years had had the size of 40 million years of 40 percent of the United States of 40 percent.
But this is the free of the problem because it doesn't show it of the ice.
The art glacial art is, in a sense, the art of global climate system.
You expand it back and returns out the summer and you get right.
The next slide will be a rapid carlled on the last 25 years.
The glack lost are drawed in red it.
As you see, they expand they get to the blue up.
That's the ice ice ice in the winter wall.
You can see that the ice ice ice ice ice ice perenness, five years or more or more like the blood like smoke, which is what the blood of the body.
In 25 years was spent on this --
This is a problem because the interested in the art of the artor of the art in the ocean where there are huge amount of carbon fieled that that sheet that sheet that sheets are transformed in meters from microbies.
Resspacing to the totality of the atmospheric warming, that amount could double it could ddop, surround this point of not return.
In some of laka little deep in Alaska putting on the water.
The professor. Katey Walter of the University of Alaska has been recated team at the last last last last last last last last last last last last year.
Video: Wow! Al Gore: She's good. The question is if we will be the well.
A reason is that this exchange in the Greenland surgerland of the Greenland from the north.
This is a glacial ur right.
The leveled he never reached levels.
This is the Kangerlusathume and the Greenland.
If you want to know how the level of the leveling for the skets of the glevel, here is where the sea level the sea.
These corres are increasing rapidly of it.
Another part of the planet: Antarts, the largest block of the planet.
The months last last months have declared that the glacium is in negative, and that Antarcticl, which Antarcticols on some islands under in the short-up and is particularly rapid in the sheet.
Equired to six feet of water in the water of water, like in Greenland.
And the Himalaya, the third largest block of ice block of ice block -- who was ice in the glacium --
40 percent of the world's population was going to be a tough of the water from the slights.
One Ande: this ice is the source of water is the source of this city.
The leveled is increased.
But when he decreases the same thing happens to the water in the water.
In California the Sierra Nevada is diminuth.
The rips are in crisis.
The predictions, like you red, are freezed --
The growing of the world takes a remarkable increases in the world increase.
The environmental disasters are increasing to the normal and without precedent.
Four times more number in the last 30 years of the last 30 years of previous respective to 75.
This is a whole thing about insustainable to the insustainable gay.
If you look at the context of the historical consequences.
In the last five years we added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the oceans every day.
Look at the area of the oriental Pacific Pacific America, from the sub-bang of the continent in the continent in the continent in the oceans.
The majority causes of global warming, together to deforestation, which is the 20 percent, is the use of fossils.
The oil is a problem, and carbon is even worse is even worse as a lot.
The United States are one of the two countries with the most emissions, together.
And it was proposed to build a lot of other central carbon die.
But we're going to be a shifty of direction.
These are the projects in the last few years and some of the alternative proposites.
All the way there is a political lotate in our country.
The carbon industries and oil industries have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote the carbon of carbon that clean oxy-like oxio.
And I remember remined me to remind me --
I was Natal, in Tennessee, where I live in the Tennesse, billion literally carbon disease of carbon die.
Maybe you saw it in the news.
This is the second largest flows in America.
It's happened around Natma.
The natalized publishes of carbon industries was thise.
Video: Man: Frosty the carbon is a type and happy --
It's a deal here in America, and it makes our economy.
Frosty the carbon is increasingly cleaner.
It's at the price, lovable and workers are kept the stypendent stand.
Al Gore: From here is the carbon of the West Virginia.
The largest society on mountains is Massey Coal. This is Massey Coal.
Video: Don Blankenship: I'm going to clear -- Al Gore, Nancy Pelous, Harry Reid -- they don't know what they're talking about.
Al Gore: So the Alleance for the Proteam.
This is a one of it.
Video: All right, "ALery we see the changes as a matter to our business as a matter to our business.
So our priority is to invest a great amount of money in a bunch of money in a bunch of the carbon and confuses the truth.
In fact, the carbon is not sport.
We think it's cleaned -- it also has a good fum.
So not predictateful for climate change.
Let me do to do it.
Video: All right, Carbon -- you heard about it very much.
So let's take a game in a structure to go to a frames of the carbon of the carbon of the carbon of the carb.
Straordinary is a little romore! The machines are a little romore, but this is the sound of carbon technology.
The carbon is between the main of the main warming, but the remarkable technology of carbon is that you see changing everything that you see changes everything.
You look at a eyebasic god-technology goods.
Al Gore: Finally, the positive alternative positive is connected to the economic safety and that of national security and that of national security and the national security of the national security and the national security is a national security and the national se
Video: Comment: The America, is in crisi; the economy, national, safety climate crisis.
The filter that colleagues everything: our dependence from the combustible fossil fuel, like the carbon and oil and oil and oil is important.
Now, there's a new audriven by using solution for use.
Build power America: 1000 percent of clean energy in decaught years.
They plan to stand in America to work, make safer safer than you can get the global warming.
Finally, a solution that you have to solve our problems.
Repower of America. It bought more.
Al Gore: This is the ultimate one.
Video: Comment: It's about to re-energy to America.
One of the fast fastest ways to take dependence from the combustible combustible that we kill our planet.
She was here. The future is here. I just -- a new energy network.
She has 2: Nuoves investment for posters to be well-retribes.
M: Repower America. It's time to be realists.
Al Gore: A old African old deverbs saying, "If you want to go fast it from the money.
If you want to go far away from it."
We have to go away at the fast.
Thank you very much.
Last year TED phecraft last year in LHC.
And I try to go back to the back to how the machine.
So I got it. And for those who are the other time you don't have the other time in the She's the largest scientific experiment -- 27 miles of circuit of circumer surround surround of circuit of it.
Her compiece is to return the conditions that were present less than a billion on the beginning of the universe -- until 600 million times a second.
And all of this is simply environment.
This is the machine underneath Geneva.
We photographs Bang Bang Bang in the reevers.
This is what I work. It's called ATLAS -- it's largely 44 meters and it has a 22 feet of meters and has a 2-foot diamet.
This is a spectacular image of ATLAS in building so you can see proportions.
The 10 seeptember year, we have accesses in the first time.
And this picture was taken by AS.
It was because of immenses in the control of the control.
It's a picture of the first phascial particles that had done all the LHC, and in collision, and deliberately with a part of the LHC, and spread particles inside the reevator.
In other words, when we saw that image the 10 10 of the 10 10 set, we understand that machine worked on that is a great life.
I don't know if it was to do exult us more opposed to Google and saw that the pay was this one.
That means we have a cultural impact in the scientific impact at that one of the scientific impact.
About a week later, it was a problem with the machine, and it had to these files here -- these files -- these files -- these files -- these files -- these files -- these files -- these files -- these files files -- these files -- these movies.
These files take 13,000 prints when the machine works at the power.
Now, technical technical of you look at files and they will say, "It's not true. I'm not true. I'm not true.
And they can do it because when they are very cold when they are very cold to the superconvicts.
So, at 271 degree, at a high-raiser temperature in the room, these files can take that running that run.
In one of the most of the magnets in the LHC, there was a defection of the LHC, there was a fabriction of rectation.
So the files are surgery to read and 13,000 prints of suddenly meeting a electric resistance.
This was the result.
Now, this is even more impression, if you think that these magnets are about 30 centimeters and that have been moved about 30 centimeters.
They are damaged about 50 magnets.
We needed to take it up, what we did.
We have repristined and add it.
They're now going back to all their place underground.
Entro the end of the LHC will be new integround.
We let it out, and we expect to get the data or him, and keep it or him, and keep it on the adventure of what the universe.
Now, of course, in a certain further -- these crash incident on the value of science and engineering. It's evidence and engineering.
I think that it is so difficult to go beyond the limits, I think it's the value of things like LHC.
I want to conclude with the words of a Inglese, Humphrey Davy, which I image, in defense of inuseful experiments of his pupllo was Michael Faray, he said, "No is a dangerous for progress of the human mind as the human mind as the reals' mind as the human mind is dealing that the whole ideas that are deal with the degrees of the world's completely resold the world."
Thank you.
I want to start asking you to rethink about that I was a children, you play coins the morning bricks.
While you understand how you reach them and reaching them and reach them and realized and realized problems and resolve problems and resolve problems and manipulating relationships.
The reasoning reasons is deeply connected to the way we figure out a lot of the world around us.
So, as a information of our interaction with physics, and I started asking myself with physics, and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanith, I started asking myself, I started to ask mouse the computer -- "Whereas we use a computer, instead of having the only cursor a degital with a desktop, we can deal with a name information with an entist entrames of physically a srame,
and it to our please?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer to the answer Siftable.
In a few words, a Siftable computer is a big discover.
In a few words, a Siftable computer is a big discover.
You can move them with the hands, they can see it in a movement and have a radio and have a wireless.
But most of physics, as physics, as matter matter to be simply to result.
The Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem of tools for manipulate information.
And as they get more physics, and I knew physics, and as they do more physics, and as they get more physics, and they become more physics, as we can be exploring new stily and we can explore new style of interactions.
I'm going to start with some simple example.
This Siftable is configurated to show the video it in a direction, the video it will go back to the other side of the other side back.
These riticians are aware of the others.
If they are in the fact what they are around it.
If they are surround, they can get a little bit of a bunch of it.
If they are surround, they can get a little bit of a bunch of it.
They also have their movement and inclination.
We then realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was power to use of data, as a color as if it was a liquid.
We have three Siftable to be configurated as seckets and I can use them to use them to be a central colors in the central central where you middle is to middle in that central central of the color.
and I can use them to use them to be a central color, where they mix they mix.
If we can get too much of it, we can remit a little bit about place.
There's also beautiful of learning, like language, as the language, the mathematics and games of logics where people can try things and see the results of things and see the results.
I'm now --
This is a Fibonacus that I do with a program of equations.
We have a game of words that is half between Scarabeo and Boggle.
First, at every turn I got a letter to every turn on every Siftable, Pratically, I got a letter in every turn Siftable, and as you try to get a letter in the Siftable, and while it of control on a dictionary.
Then, after about 30 seconds remissing, and you have a new set of letting and new possibility to try to get a new possibility of reading and ned.
Thank you.
And so that they came to the Media Lab, I did in Lab, I did it and I turned it a video.
They were lots of it.
And one of the interesting things that kind of applied applied is that you don't have to give people many instructions.
You just said, "The ponds of the words, and they know exactly what to do.
That's what other people who try to do it.
This is our most young beta young beta young better.
It was actually wanted to be implpilarge.
They just were matter for him.
Now, this is a applied appliance.
We wanted to build a tool for the Lui is Felix.
It can inserve new person's scene, and he can be slieving the Siftable their associats.
It can inserve new person's scene, and he can be slieving the Siftable their associats.
And that's doing that the sun.
Video: The Sun is surgence is sungary.
David Merrill: Now he took a treat in the scene.
Video: The treatment.
By work!
So I was schools and putting them close to the person's characters can interact --
Video: Bau!
-- by inventing their story.
Video: Cao!
DM: It's a story with an open open-up, and it can decide how you get up.
DM: It's a story with an open open-up, and it can decide how you get up.
Video: Vole, gar.
DM: The last example I have time to show you is a tool, realized to be a tool, to try and execk and execk music.
it's a tool, realized recently, to sample, and to execk and music.
The Siftable here is the basic sounds like based and bacteria.
Every one of these has four different variations, and you can choose what use.
You can inserve these sounds in a sequence, to be a sequence.
And to modify it simply doing a "sound of a "sequence."
These are effects that you can control from live, like reverty and the filter.
I realized it in a particular and then including it to add it.
And then there are the general effects like time and volume, which are applied in the sequence.
Let's look at how it works.
Video: DM: We're going to start a two Siftable Siftable sequence, we system, we system, the extending in a series, we add other base.
I am now now a baside.
Video: DM: Now I am to add the perceptures --
Video: And I'm going to put the filter filter to the bacteria, so I can control effect from live.
Video: I can fast the whole sequencing the whole sequencing time from one or the other.
Video: She goes on the basset of the movie to the basset to give more expression.
Video: I can recombine the sequence.
So I didn't have to plan before, but I can try to improvise, but I can try and make it longer or more cortase.
And now, finally, I can get the whole sequencing the whole sequencing the Siftable to the Siftable "volution."
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is build new interface new interface of man-machine machine that our brain and body.
And I today, I had time to show you one of the results of this perfect and some possibility that we try to bring out of the lab.
The concept I want to transmit you is coming this new generation of objects to interact with the average media project media that will be information in our world that we want.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the time to talk to all of you.
I'm a writing write.
Soring books is my profession, but it's more than that, obviously.
It's also the love and the phascine of my life.
And I don't aspect that can change it.
But I said that, something particular happened in my life and career in my life and career that has taken me to realibrate the whole report with this work.
The particularly thing I recently written this book, this biography called "Mangia, Pruly whatever, in my precedents for some resilibris, for some reason in the world and became a big sensational.
And the result is that everywhere is now, people like to like I was convicted.
By -- convicty condamated.
They come from me and they say, "You don't have praise and they say, "You don't fear anymore,
You don't have putting to continue to write for all of life without power to create a book that can be able to create a book that can be able to someone who can matter someone who can you matter someone who can matter anyone who can be able to create a book that for anyone that can be able to create a book that can be able to create a book that can be able to create a book that can be able to do a book
which can matter someone who can you look at the point of them?"
It's resurecting, you know.
But it could go worse -- I remember that I remember more than 20 years ago, when I started to say to people -- I was a training -- I wanted to be a ritical writtric.
I was going to meet the same reaction of the same reaction by the country
And people said, "Don't you care about me, "Don't you success?
Don't you afraid that humit you killed you kill?
You don't have putting to do this mestide all of life without any of the whole life that was coming up and die on a cumulation of the shake of the shot of flies with the mouth of fallip?"
You know, you know.
The answer -- the short answer to all of these questions is, "Si."
I fear of all of things --
I always had fear I always had paper.
And I also have fear of many other things that would not be ine.
As a lose and other things spraften up.
But as I was writing it to write I was really thinking and I wonderful is why is?
Is it rational?
And everyone who who have to be expect to be saved by a work that you feel to do with a work that you feel for it.
But what is that we can particular in the impresely creative to make us about mental minute of the mental health mental health in a way that other career doesn't do?
How my father, for example, he was a chemical engineer and I don't remember one time in her 40 years of activity in her 40 years of activity to be engineer if he had putting to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer if he was a chemistry of the activity that was a chemist engineer to be engineer if he had to
There was never -- that block of John, like what?
It didn't worked, it wasn't it?
Onestly, the engineers like group not in the several century, in the secouple of the reputation of being alcoholed manacres.
We have enough of the writers -- we have enough this reputation of every general -- we have this reputation of every general being enormously instable.
And it's not really, what you look at the contact of the magnific deaths of the magnific death, and they are young and often for them to be young and often to them.
And the ones that you don't have suicide to be really disdata from their women.
Norman Mailer, before I did, in the last interviewed was a little more book me a little more than "Ogni is a little more remarkable remarkable remarkable record of your life.
But we don't have that we heard about why we have these things that long as we have these things that are so much interior and accepted the notion that creativity and the notion that creativity and the art is in some way and the art and that art and the art and art the angods.
And the question I want to ask all of the is: you agree with this idea?
It goes you do -- because even look at it from a centimeter of distance at me -- it doesn't good-to-such supposed to do anything that suppose --
I think it's hodie.
And I think it's also dangerous and I don't want to see perpetuately in the next century.
I think it's better to encourage our big minds creative to viver.
And of course, I know that in my case -- in my case -- in my situation -- in my situation -- in my own situation -- in my carefugees that I was in my career.
Obly -- it was just a young as much young as I have about 40 years.
I still about four work in me.
And it's very likely to be likely to write that is going to be right now that he used by the world as the work that used after the work that used to be successful in my last book.
I'm going to be sky, because we're all more or less friends here -- it's likely to be a lot of successful is to my shares.
Oh, Gesus, that think!
You know this is the kind of thinking about the person to start to begin to begin to go into the nine morning. I don't want to do it.
I would keep doing this work that I love to do this work that I love it.
So, the question become?
And so it seeds me after many reflections, that the way to work to do to continue to write is to create a psychological psychological cover, okay?
I have to find a distance of safety in me, that I'm writing, and my natural re's natural reaction of what reaction is going to be able to get E, as I was trying to get out of the time to be in the time, trying to find out if they started looking through the time, trying to find if they could have the other ideas to see if they could have the best ideas and healthy of the best ideas.
about how to help people to help creative emotional reality,
And that research took me to the ancient of the ancient and Roma.
Seguitls because it turns out and then back.
In the ancient Grecian and Rome -- people didn't seem to believe that creativity came from human, OK?
And it was thinking that creativity was to be devine and that came to men from a few surface, and unknown and unknown as distants and unknown as distants and unknown out.
The greater called these demons of the demoniors of creativity of the demonith."
Socrate, wonderful, he believed to have a demion that elargive wisdom that elected away.
The Romans were the same idea, but they called the kind of spirit without body a genius.
Which is big because Romans didn't really think that a genius was somebody particularly smart --
They resive that a genius was this kind of a divine that you would live in the walls of the study of a artist, a little bit like Dobby, and that came out of the Dobby, and that came out of the argument of the job and modeling the outcome.
Excitial -- that's the distance of the psychological psychological costruction that you protected you from your work.
And everyone knew that was so that he worked, right?
So the anties were protected to certain things, like for example the too narcissm, right?
If your work was exceptional was not to take it all the market, everybody knew that was helped by this genius to have been helped by this incorporate genius was to help it in this incorporate a genius was to get all the market, you could get all the market, and they could have been taken all of the market, they could have been helped by this incorporate that you could not have any exception.
If your work failure, it wasn't all of your own own cool, right?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be a inable to be a inable to be a inable to be a inable to be a inable to be a inable to be a inable to be a inable to be a inable to be a inable to be a inable to be a inability.
And so people have conceived the creativity in Occident for a long time.
And then Rinascisnitrolled and all this big idea; we put it out of the human beings on the center of the universe and the middsters and and no longer and the creatures of the creatures of the creatures of detailed by divinity.
This was the principle of the rational human and they started to think that creativity came to think that creativity came from idu.
And for the first time in history, I began to refer this or that artist as a genius like a genius with genius.
And I must tell you, I think it was a big mistake.
I think that allowing someone -- a simple person to be like a recipe of being like the source, and the surgery and the surgery of all the mysteries and four-and-a-a-like responsibility to be a film or too big human beings to be a fragile of human beings.
It's like to ask somebody of the sun.
Defform and the completely and creates all these ingestible expectations on performance.
And I think it was this pressure to destroy the art of the art in the pasts in the past.
And, if this is true, and I think it is the question become, and I think it is it?
Can we do it different?
Maybe go back to a more ancient understanding of the relationship between humans and mystered creative.
Or maybe no.
Maybe we can't cancer 500 years of rational thinking.
And you probably have people in the audience that would be legitymes of scientific notion on the notion of the notion of the notion of the notion of them to be free of their projects.
I probably don't think I'm going to convinced you all about this thing.
But the question I would like to ask is -- why is?
Why don't you think it in this way?
Because he has more sense of every other thing that I ever heard to explain the exxperant impredictability of creative process.
A process that as anyone who ever tried to do -- so fundamentally, everybody here -- yes, you don't understand it is it rationally reutionally.
And, in fact, it can be completely paranormal seems completely paranormal
I did this meeting Ruth Stone, and he was a poeter Ruth Stone, which has 90 years, but it was a poeter for everyone for all of life and told me that during her own in the realm Virginia, working it out in the field, and I felt it in the same, and I felt it in the landscape.
He told me that it was like a reachorous fragorous row.
And he came rolling back to her room from the landscape.
He heard it goes, because he was to try to get the earth under his feet.
She knew that he was to have one thing to do to that point and it was gone morning, "running like a morn."
And so it comes home and came up and came followed by this poem and would be a piece of paper and a nice piece of paper and a pretty fastic cool in and a pretty fast in the past, and it it it on the page.
Sometimes he couldn't be enough fast, so it was running and running and running it to get into the home and poetry and poetry the rolled rolled through the lands and she would keep rotolding through the landscape, and he would be a little bit of a poeta."
Then there were those times -- this piece never forget -- there were some moments in which was almost losing the moments that was almost losing --
So, he was running at home and he was looking for card and the poetry went through and switched it in the one that he was in the one that he was like if you go and then he was like you to get up and the gaxis and the glacive.
He was the poem from the coda and he reputting it in the body and turned it into the page.
And in these cases, the poem would be presented on perfect and intact page and intact on the last word to the first one of the first one in the last word of the first one of the last word of the perfect page.
So when I felt it -- it's crazy to my own creative process.
I don't all my creative process -- I'm not a convict!
I'm a mule, and my way to work is to see me at the same every day and sweets every day and work and go and go up and go up and go up and go up and go up and go up and go up and go up and go up and go up and go up and go up and go on and go up and go up and go up and go up and go up and go up and go on and go up and go up and go up and go up and go up and go up and go up and go on and go up and go up and go up and go up and go up and go on and go on and go over and go f
But even in my head, I was test against that thing, I was sliped against that thing, sometime.
And I imagine that many of you can also have a lot of you do it.
You know, even if the work and ideas and ideas and I came to me from a certain fundamental source I could not be able to know.
And what is this thing?
And how can we react it to be relationship, but rather than the head, rather than you can get heighborhood?
And I think about it was about the best example of me that I have is the Tom Waits, which I interviewed funnal years ago for a day.
We were talking about this, and you know, Tom, and you know, Tom, for the magical person of life was the incarnation of the artist of the artist of the arm, and dominate these species of creative clean creative impulses.
But then he hot he hot and he was driving on a highwaiting on the augments Angeles, changed all for him.
He was going to fast and all of a tiny fragments of this melodia, which goes in his head, which is in his head, elusive and thetic inspiry, and you know, it's wonderful, you know, won't how to take it it.
It doesn't have a piece of cardbox, he doesn't have a matheme recorator.
So it begins to feel this kind of old old old old old old old is to person and I will lose and remarrying obsessionate from this song of lost allowed by this song of song as I think of this song of song is to pered by this song of the old old one of the song of the old old old old old old old out of this song of old old old old out of this song of the old old onto persemen.
I'm not good enough and I can't do this --
And instead of go into the panic panic --
And he went to the whole mental process and he did something completely new thing.
And he just looked at the sky and said, "Scuse, you can't see that I'm driving I do it?"
"You seems that can write a song hor?
If you really want to exist, you know, it in a more opportunity when I can take care of you.
And I went to address, you go to the other other now.
You go to disturbing Leonard Cohen."
And his process working changed after this.
Not work, the work was still dark like pretty much as you pretty much as you pret.
But the processing, and fish anks that was released when the genius, the genius, the genius, which was that the genius that would be a realized it realizing it back where it was not to be a interior and they realized that he had not be a interior.
but it good, wonderful bizarre collaboration a conversation of Tom and this strange conversation and external thing that even was not Tom.
So I was how I felt that story began to change the way I was working and saved me and saved me a face.
This idea, saved me when I was writing "Mangia, Prula, Prule, and falls of those clear disperation where we all are working on something and we can all and began to think that will be a disaster book.
Not only bad book.
And I started to think about designing this project.
But then I remember reminds me of Tom who talked about the air and triaway.
I went up my face on the manufacturing and I would say my comments to a angle of the room.
And I told you you, "Yeah, both my book that if this book not going to be brilliant not be brilliant, right?
Because I see I am a I saw what I haven't more than that.
So if you want to be better and you have to be better and do your party.
Okay. But if you don't do it, I don't know about it fresh.
I'm going to write the same because it's my work.
And I would like to do that I today today I showed me to do my part, because I was presented to my part, and that's the way -- that's the way it is -- and it makes in the deserts of the dances of the long and the dances and the sacred of the moons and the sacross the moon and the high-hours and the floor.
And they were always magnific because the ballers were professional and they were fantastic.
But every one of these arts, something happened, and one of these artists would be actually transendently transendent.
And I know what I know about what I know about it, because I know that you all of you, a performance like this.
It was as if you stopping and the ballerine walking through a sort of land-walking and was not doing anything from the solite, but all over the 1,000 night before, but everything we were allinvolved in it.
And suddenly it doesn't appears just like a human human --
But you access from the sluminated and under the divinity.
And when this was happening to the them, they knew what it was, they were called her named it with name.
They realized hands and they started to singing, "All Allah, God, God."
That's God, you know.
And they took the South South the Mororors of Spain, they took this south of Spain, they took this and they were going to change in the century of "Ah, Allah," which you can still feel in the corride or fle-hold, which you can see in the floflamen.
In Spain, when a artist made something impossible and the magic -- "Ah, oh, oh, oh, oh, but, and I mean, butter, and except -- a fall -- a fall -- a fall in the God.
And it's great because we need.
But the problem goes the day down, the ballery is when you wake up and discovers that are 11 morning at the morning of Martedday and they flight it in God is not more.
It's just a mortal with a dead to the kned, and perhaps it never can be able to him to get that height.
And maybe no one dog will be name the name, and so it must do it with the rest of her life?
It's hard to it.
This is one of the most pain in of creative reconciliations that you can do in a creative life.
But perhaps not to be so anded if you can not believe that it doesn't believe it in your extraordinary extraordinary to yourself, which is they are from you from you to yourself.
But it was just to you get from a instance, you know, you have been given by a squisite part of your life that you have to go to someone else when you finished.
And, you know, if we think it all changes.
And so I started thinking about it, and it's surely as I thought for several months during the book that public book that I'm going to be dangerous -- and I'm going to be dangered by my big success.
And what I have to keep me when I feel electric I feel electric I don't have putting on this is, not afraid --
Don't be walking.
He talks about you to reach you for your party, any of the partment, which is that you can be.
If your work is ball, dance,
If the grid, I measure genius to let me decide to let some kind of wonderful at a moment through your efforts through your efforts -- then "Ole!"
Altriments, you do it your dance.
And "Ole!" to yourself.
I think I think I have to be teaching it.
"Ole!" at yourself the same, even for human and head, and heading to the same of the talks to you to go and keep you all the
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
As you know I already talked about some of these projects on the human genome, on what can meaning and discovering new set of genius.
We're now beginning a new lock: we started to begin to digitalize biology and now from that code ded, we're going to go into a new phase of biology, designing and synthetic and synthetic and synthetic and synthetic and synthetic and synthetic code --
We always tried to take big questions.
"What's life, is something that many biological biology I believe they have tried to understand various levels.
We tried to the minimum minimum to minimum minimes.
We're digitalizing by almost 20 years old.
When we sequenced the genome was to go from the analogical world to the analogic world,
Now we ask us, we can regenerate life, or create new life from this digital?
This is the map of a little organism, the Mycoplasma genitalium, which is the species from the tiny genome of those that can authorestic genome in the laboratory.
And we tried to reduce the genome to create a little bit more smaller one more smaller.
We are able to eliminate a hundred genes of the about 500 of the genes of the around 500 that are here.
But when we look at her map to his map, is relatively simple respect to the note of the now.
I think of them, this is simple
But when we look at all the genes that we can helimind, one at the time, it's very imlikely to be that can bring to a live.
So we decided that the only way to progress to progress to be synthetize this chromosomes to be able to move some of these fundamental questions.
And so we started the wind of "We can synthetic a chromother of the "We can synthetic a chromother?"
Can chemistry of producing these big molecules that we never have been able to create before?
And, in fact, we can make a cromodel?
A cmosome, it's just a piece of chemical material chemical material.
The speed with which we are able to digitalize life is growing up to exponential exponential to the exponential run.
Our capacity to write the genetic code of genetic code -- it's better than that, but it's improving.
And our most results results the results to the exponential curve.
We started 15 years ago.
The process has requires a lot of pass -- beginning with a biothic reviewing first experiments.
But we found that synthesize DNA is very difficult.
There are decades of thousands of machines in the world that are producing small segments of 30 to 50 to 50 lectric lands and it's a degenerative process is longer than the segment is longer than the segments are there.
So we had to develop a new method to assembling these fragments and rors and rors and rors rors.
And this was our first attempt to start by information of Phi X 174.
It's a little viruses that bacteria.
We designed the fragments, effectured the mistaky of mistakes, and they got a DNA molecule.
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemical material chemical material that we put it in the bacteria started reading this genetic code and producing this genetic code particles in viralalso.
The virals are then release the cells, are released by cells, and they destroy and they destroyed E.
I talked about recently with members of oil industries that they certainly understanding that they certainly understood this model.
They have more than you.
We believe that this is a situation where software can really build his same hardware in a biological system.
But we wanted to do things more in big.
We wanted to build the whole chromosome.
They're over 580 miles of genetic code of genetic code.
So we thought we were thinking it in cassets of the size of virus, so that we can change the cassets to understand what the components of a living cell.
The design is crucial information and if we start with digital information in a computer, these have to be accurate.
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 the accurateess was a standard of a mibasis.
We discovered, resequencing -- 30 mierror sequence, we would never be able to do it work.
One part of the process is designing that you go to 50 level that you go to all the other seats of 50 letters of 50 letters to build underlying more smaller than it together.
We try element elements here.
You probably read that we read that we read about the filight of the filight of the filight.
Think about this thing: we have a genetic code genetic code on four letter: A, C, and T.
Three of those letters code together about 20 adminoacid about 20 adminoacid of letting for every adminoacid for every admino-a-acid of letting for every adminoacid of the letters code together to code of the letters of lects.
So we can use the gene code to write code for words, and thinking.
What we did we have done in the beginning was automotion was automobile to the beginning is to automobile to the beginning was automobile to the beginning is to automobile to the beginning is to automobile to the beginning is to automobile to the beginning is to automobile to the beginning is to automous to the be
Some of the fact that it wasn't poe."
We designed these segments to just just just to unique them with a person.
There are gone to repaid them and they put them and they put them up.
And we started to assembling the parts, starting with five to seven to seven a letter to seven thousands of lectly over to them to 24 letters of letter to get to 72 miles of literally to 72 miles of literally to set up the letter to 72 miles of the literally to seat.
And every one of the dance we product these segments in abundance so that we can sequenced that we're trying to create a remarkable proceive proceive -- as you will see in a minute.
We're trying to automatize the process.
So, this seems to be the tabellon a basket.
When we get to these segments very long, more than 100 mile -- they will not grow more directly in the E.
You get to the limited tools of the modern tool.
So we have to consider other mechanisms.
We knew about another mechanism called a homology, called recombination of homology, which is in biology to reploy the DNA to rept the seats.
That's a example.
This organism, called Deinococcus radiodurans, can absorb three million radio rad birth of radiation.
You can see in the require superior as his chromosome.
In 12 -- 24 hours is reassembled exactly as it was before.
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do this.
These organisms can be able to be completely sected.
They can live under empty.
I'm absolutely sure that life exist in space, and you shift for the water recipe of water.
I mean, NASA showed that this was showing that this living.
This is a image of the molecules that we built using these process, just using the lievised by the way to the reseats to inserious seats.
The lievisit them assembly them to the automatically
This image was not taken with a microscope, but with a microscope microscope of rule.
It's a very large molecules that we can see it with a microscope.
These are pictures that cover a period of about six seconds.
This is the publishing that we did a little time ago.
They're over 580,000 lectures of genetic code --
It's the largest molecules that we ever created by man.
It has a fish, a molecular on the 300 million.
If we spent it with a 10 cararacter, they would take 142 pages to be 142 pages to be transcride this gene code this code genetic code of this genetic code of it.
Now, how do we do it work? How can we activate it?
Obviously, you track a virus.
It's a little more complicated when you use bacteria.
It's also as simplest when it's treating cells as wells like our reds: you can simplest the nucleus and put it up a high-process clon.
In the bacteria archaea is instead of integrated into the cell, but we recently demonstrated that we can do a complete transplant that we can do a complete transplant to a cromosome from a cell of cromosome.
We can refate a crumosome, and it was a micromosome.
The two are different as mans as a men from topies.
We added some genes in a more gene way that you could decide what choosing for this chromoom.
And then he slightly with the gases of all the proteins.
And when we put it in the cells was stuff -- and you appreciate our charge softwo-sticato-mosome is going to go into the cell.
And we started to think we could not go beyond that, but we have a common to be done over there.
This is one of the machanisms of evolution.
We discovered that many species have added a second or a third or a third of a few hundreds of new tracts of thousands of new tracts to that species.
So who thinks about evolution as a only gene to evolution as a gene of the biology.
There are of the restrial of restriction is that they deal with DNA.
The chromosome, it was in the cell that they didn't have one.
The cellula-to-cromosomes that we have insert --
And it turns out and recognized the other chromosome, it has mosome, he has mosticked it with only the cells and we recognize and new crumodel.
it became blue to be blue with genes that we have inserved.
And in a short of time, all the characteristics of a species are going to lost and it turned out of the new species of the new species that we put in the software that we put in the cell.
All the protein are changed, membranes are changed, and when we read the genetic code of what we have transferited you.
Now, this could seem alchemiia alter, but altering the software DNA we can change the things in a pretty sustain.
Now, I have already explained that you don't talk about gene -- but of progress from three million years and a half years and I said that maybe we're going to create a new version of the Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosion of this digital process of the degital process of this digital process of the genese.
Why do you do that?
I think it's enough when we think about our needs as we think about our messity.
We're going to spend six billion and a half billion people in the next 40 years.
I am to to give example, I was born in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for each other in 1940 years, there will be 40 years, there will be four year.
We're going to be doing nowing problems right now to find food water and cleity, medicinal and gas, and baggency for six billion people.
It will be more during for nine billion now.
We are more than five billion carbon carbon billion carbon of oil bar.
That means a day.
When we try to find biological processes or any kind of process to replace that will be a huge challenge for a huge challenge --
We have to keep it on the whole emission of CO2 emissions that finishes in the atmosphere.
At day, because of the whole thing about the scientific discoveries in all the world, we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I like to think that are the designed for the future.
The electronic industry has only a dozen of components, and think about how many different things are out of it.
Our limitations here are main reality and our imagination.
We now have the techniques, thanks to these methods of synthetic methods that we call genomics that we call genomics combined.
We can be able to build a big robots that can produce a million chromosomes a million of a day.
Think about this 20 million different genes of different genes or to try to get the processes to get the processes to get a drugs, or drugs, we can change and a little team, and create more biology and create more bigger than in the last 20 years,
And it's just a standard selection of standard.
We can choose to survive, chemistry of chemistry or carbon of vaccines or carbon of vaccines --
This is a few software of some software programmed on which we're working for us to be able to seat, and designing species to computer.
Well, we don't know necessarily as they will be no.
We know exactly how they is their genetic code.
We're now concentrying on the urant carbon of fourth generation.
You can see that you can extract out of the grand was a finished experiment experiment of the way.
We have a second carbon and third generation that will be pretty much floor, as much as a sugar carbon like either or different kinds of value like either or different kinds of dive.
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without even more impact and the food of food and limited the disease, which we are working for the CO2 in the material that we are working for the design that can be transforming cells that can reach cells that can reach the stem carbon of four-months.
The sunlight with CO2 is a methodom -- in our purposed all over the world, we found different metodis.
This is a organism that we described in 1996.
It lives in the ocean deep about 2500 feet of the deep temperature of the water temperature of water.
It takes it from CO2 using a hydrogen, like a source of energy.
We're trying to figure out if we can inchanaling CO2, that can easily be transported by carbon that CO2 in carbon to carbon this process.
So short we think we could be able to increase what the basic question of the basic is Noe, truth, Noo, truth, which is the whole thing we have the oil industry.
Exactly. If you can't do it from TED, where can you do?
It would become a principal source of energy.
But we're working for using the same methods to create vaccines.
You saw this year with influence, we are always backwards, and we are always back.
I think that what you can change build vaccinable to change in ancient vaccinable in ancient an.
That's how the future could begin to change it, the evolution, the tree of evolution, accelerating evolution, accelerating the evolution, and then cells.
We're at so much from the best people.
Our purpose is to live enough to try to do it for a long way to try to do it thank you very much.
I will see the most rapidly possible, the most possible, some fundamental work that we took Microsoft in the Microsoft in a year ago.
It's about a environment that you can interact is in the local level, which remote with a huge amount of visual data --
We're seeing a lot of gabyte pictures of digital pictures of a zoom and continue, to be a fastic pictures like we want.
And it doesn't matter how big the amount of information that we see, how big we see that are big these data or images.
Most is communicates -- but this for example is a scansion from Bilibrary of Congress, and he entered in the 300 megam.
It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that the prestations of a system like this is the number of place in your screen in any moment. It's also a very flexel of architecture.
This is a book internal data of data not images.
This is the SSsoliid of Dickens. Every couple represents a capitol.
And to show you that it's about text and not images, we can do something like that, to do something like to see that it's a real representation of the textbook.
It could be a little bit of an articular book a book electronic book.
You don't recommen.
This is a more realistic example of the Guardian number of The Guardian.
Every image is the beginning of a section.
And it will tell you really the pleasure and beautiful experience of read the paper version of a view or a newspaper or of a newspaper, which is a lot of half a lot of half a lot of half a lot of half a lot of a matter --
We also did something with the angle of this number of the Guardian Sort's angle of the Guardian angle of this number of this particular number of of this particular number of of the Guardian.
We created a high-resolution, higher -- much higher -- much higher than you use in a normal advertising -- and we put you in the extra.
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile, you can see here.
or even other models, or even specific specific models, or even specific specific models, or even specific specific models, or even specific models, or even specific other models, or even specific the models, or even specific models, or even specific specific models, or even speci
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limited limited limited space on the screen of the screen of the screen of space on the screen of space to the screen of the screen of space to the screen of space to the limitations of space to eliminate the limits of the screen of
We hope that this means to put pop up and other pop-up and other cleaners and other similar, not to be necessary.
Of course, maping is one of the obvious applications for this kind of technology.
And I don't want to lose time, if not to say that we have contributes from giving it in this field.
These are all the way in the U.S. obstandpatial image of NASA.
So now we go to something else.
This is actually from the webs; you can go to the webs; you can go to see it.
It's about a project called Photosynth, which combine two different technologies.
One is Seadragon and the other is a very interesting research of a very interesting research of the University of Washington of the U.S. Steve Steve Seliski Seliski Szeliski Resear. Siottimal Resear. She has a collaboration.
And it's from the web, I run by Seadragonon.
You can see it when we do this kind of screen that we can go from a picture to another and have this kind of experience at the other one multiple resolution.
But the space of the images of the images here has actually meaningly a meaning.
The algorithms of visualization of the computer have record of the computer records together, so that they can stay -- all the neighborhood -- all the neighborhoods on Montags -- have been taken on Montags -- have been taken element of a slide-show shows a slide-showed spite image of a space.
I don't know if I have time to show you some other environment.
There are some more space.
I want to spend directly to one of the Noahanded of Noah-- and this comes from a precedent prototynthy that we have done working for the first time you have done in the last last -- to show you what I think is the chiefs is really the chiefs the key technology -- Photosythosynth. And it's not necessarily look at the environments that we put in the website that website environment.
We had to worry about legal ways.
This is a rebuilding in the Cathral Dame in Flickr. Basta digitary to Notre Dame in Flickr. Basta Flickr. And you get images of the field, other of the field of the field of the arange of these constitutions represents a picture that is discovered appears to this model.
So I'm all images that Flickl, and I was all connected to the space in this way.
And it's possible to navigate in this simple.
You know, I would never think I would never think I ended up to working for Microsoft.
It's very gratification to receive this kind of basic accover.
I think you can see that it's a lot of different kinds of fun fun of fun fun of the photos to the one of the cells of the SLR, a significant number of meaningful phones in this environment.
And if you can try to figure out what strange.
Many of them are blocked by faces, etc.
And in some part here is a series of photographs -- etch of pictures -- etch of it.
This is a Notre poster of Notre Dame Pame Precorrectly.
We can go from the poster of the poster physics of this environment.
The essential point is that we can do things with the social environment. This is now taking from the whole memory of viewing the Earth, from the point of view -- and college everyone together.
All of those pictures become connected, more of the same.
You have a land the entire land that emerge.
Think about this as a modeling of Stephen Lawler Earth
It's something that is that grows in complexity as people using it to the people use. And the vantages for the people who use it with use.
Their picture of them are marched by other people.
If you get the idea of contransforming all these seers saying the name of the name of Notre Dame suddenly Dame suddenly recognized of all those data, and I can use as a point of the data for immergs in the space, in that universe, using the photos of the space, and have a social experience experience of the sky of the type and cross-user experience experience of the type and cross-user.
Of course, a consequence of all this is extremely elaborated virtual virtual in the earth, and you don't just just from airplanes and images and the images and the images and the images and similar memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I understand what your software is that your software will you to do is that at some point, in the next years, all the photographs and shared by anyone in the whole world will be basically colleague,
BA: Yeah. What's doing in practice.
It's creating a hyperlinks, if you want to begin in images.
And it's doing it based on the containt of the images.
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the richness of information that many of these images can edonies.
As when you do a research of the web, you told a sentence and the web on the web has a lot of information about the pictures of the pictures.
Now, what happens if that picture is connected to all your picture?
So the amount of interconnection and the amount of rechech and the recise of the retasy that goes is really enormous.
CA: Blaise, it's really amazing.
BA: Thank you very much.
One of the main of the main when you travel and one of the ethnic research is the power of the research between who he's not forgotten the anti-tradition-truths in the wind, you touches in the wind of plants.
Basti is the Laking of the Guarms Jaguar, or that the Milky Waya, or that the myths are still in Himalaya, the budhold-aya, the buddholds the respiry's importance of the anthropoloy of the anthropologia, and that idea that the world we don't exist sense of sense.
the consequence of a particular choices that our stirps that our stirps have done or malong generations ago.
And, of course, we all sharing essential trates.
We all all of it. We all procreated.
We're subjects in the beginning of the beginning of the beginning of the begins.
We have to deal with the death, so we don't have to deal and so we don't surprised and drive --
we have a art of art.
What it is the range of the song of the song of the song of every culture.
It doesn't matter that they are the English of the Borneo, or the following Haiti, or the Sahara.
He was my journey of journey in the desert of the yak in the desert in the world.
All of these populations teaches that there are other ways of thinking, other ways of thinking, other ways of thinking, other ways of moving in the world.
And, if you stand a minute at the moment.
And I mean, my miridle of cultures of the world create a raise of life, cultural life, which is important for the bend of the planet and is important for the bend of the planet as a biosphering biose.
And you can think about this ragnailed cultural as a a ethnose of ethnose. And you can define the ethnose. And you can define the etho-sumptions -- and intuitions in being from the human imagination from the human allow-beings to be from the human allow-beings of the consciousness from the human albath.
The ethnos: The fantastic remonugity.
It's the symmbol of what we can be in as a species of what we can be in a species --
And because the biosphere was freaked to be freaked as much as it is happened to the etness and purchased much more quickly.
No biology, for example, it would say 50 percent of all the species was or on the horle of the extinction of the extinction of the biological diversity -- in the most of the biological diversity -- in the most of the biological diversity -- that is a little bit of a little bit of a tystic, the different pounds in the most optimistic.
The indication of all of this is, of course, the language.
When you were born six,000 language on this planet.
A language is not just by a vocabulary or from a vocabulary or from a series of rules.
One language is the human spirit of the human spirit spirit of the human spirit spirit of the human spirit spirit of the human spirit spiris.
It's the mean with which animation of every culture is in the material world,
Every language is a forest of the mind, a thinking, a thinking, a thinking, a though, ecosystem of spiritual system.
And of those 6,000 languages as we are here in Monterey, at least half the half of the children.
They don't come more teached to children, which means not walking something -- that they already have died.
What is there is more than being fly in the sken of being the last one language, to be the last tongue, not a way of transmit to be the wisdom or of the daughters of children's son?
And I was a sleeping was somebody in some part of the world every two weeks of a few weeks a die and leads with themselves in the tombs of a language of a anguguguguguguguguguguguguguguguguguguguguguguguguguguy.
And I know that somebody who will say "Isn't it better?
The world would not be a better place, if we all spot the same langu?" Bensyno, then we are all around yoruba. We all talk about the yoruba.
We talk to kog.
Scover you could not be a tack-powered track your language.
I would like to do a journey through ethnos:
a little journey in ethnose to you a little bit of what we're lost of what we're loging.
Many of us forget when I say "different different ways of existing existing existing exists.
We take for example, this birthBarasan Amazon Scre-anacrionial of the anaconda, which creates of the anacrise of the best sandwal-in the skin of the skets of the pand-a-driver of the patterns of the sandwill.
It's about a population that it doesn't be able to distinguid the blue color, because the once is identified in the forest, which is identified in the forest, which dependent dependent on the forest, which is identified the population.
They have a strange language and a matheme of mathem, "English of language -- you have to a person who talks about a different language.
And all of this has radicated in the mythological past, all the way in these families that are about six or seven language of making mathemrimoney in a language of mysts in a language.
They listen to and then start talking about.
We take one of the most interesting tribes that I lived in the Waorananish Ecuador of Ecuador who had the first contacts in 1958.
In 1957 five misionary missionaried a committed mistake.
They made up from the high photographs that they were returned them into a few people who were returned out that this population of the forest, he had never seen anything in the size of the size of the size of the size of bi-dimensional photograph that they would be loved in the size of the size of the photographs that they would be returned out to be loved by the high-dimensional photographs that they would be love in the size of the size of the size
They raised the photograph of the Earth, they turned it to a shape or a figury or a figure out that he was dead, and they killed that he was the divold, and they killed the five of misionaries with the lances.
But the Waorans didn't kill strangers.
They kill a lot of them.
Five percent of mortality was caused by them to be there.
We are risalitited to eight generations and we found two of natural death and when we insisted for knowledge that one of them was dead, and then they killed it was dead, and then they killed it up.
The cactors were able to recognize the animal from 40 steps and recognized the species.
In the first '80s, I was assigned a very interesting when my professor when my professor of Harvard to ask me if I wanted to go to Haiti in the power of the power of Duval and the power of Duval and Tonton Macoutes and Tonton Macoutes and Tonton Macoutes for the chelome.
To give a sense of miraculous miraculous, I should understand the Vodoun culture, and that the Vodough is not nera.
It's pretty much of a complex metahaxy of the world.
Very interesting.
If I ask you to tell me the big religions of the world, what would you say to me say?
Cristianity: Islam, Budddismo, Ebraism, etc.
A continent is always left out of the sub-Saharan Africa, and it doesn't have religious religious of the slave is not what the distilled of these religious concepts of these religious concepts in the slavery of the slavery of the slavery of the slavery of the slavery.
What makes interesting your voodoo is the intense is the intense of life and dead.
So the way you live the spirits.
You can be invocated by the Great Acclean Actually, they answer to the rate and replace to the rate of the dancing of the soul that for a short of the following becomes the dio.
So for this voodoodoodoodoodoodoodon to talk about God.
We become in temple, and we become God."
And from the moment you are posstwo, is the spirit that you drive you drive you drive you dy?
So you get to these incredible events of incredible events of the exciting states that touch of the power of the power in the power of the power when it was catalyzed in the body of the power when it was catalyzed in a state of exciting.
And I lived in all the people that I lived in the most extraordinary the Kogi Sierra de Santa Mara, in the Santa Mara, in the seven-re-re-re-re-re-re-re-re-re-re-year-old re-old re-remarkable in the Santa Santa Santa Mara, in the Santa Sierra of the Nevada de Santa Santa Santa Santa Santa is the Kogi Sierra Santa Sierra Santa Santa Sierra de Santa Santa S
And the ancient civilization that you live on the carelage of Colombia in the Colombia in attention of the conquery in the carbon plan.
In a continent of blood of blood vessels -- this population never been conquered by the spagnos.
And yet today are governed by a classil, but their shaped is a very extraordinary --
The young people followed from the families to three or four years, and they live in a world of good and they live in a world of glaciers to the base of the glaciers for 18 years.
Two periods of nine years of proposed to reduce the nine months that they turned into the user of the gestation of the mother, I'm metaphorically, in the utter of the Great Mad.
So this time, they are acculated to the values of their society, values that pre-praying and only their praying and they just reliequilibrio -- or to say the balance -- or to say the equilibrium.
And in terms of this incredible beginning, they are suddenly carried out and for the first time in life in them, at 18 years, they see a albe. And in that active of the first bad of the first bad wrong backy's drop, all that they learned in theory is all that they learned in theory is all the way her beautiful backwards. The pretty much of the pretty much back.
"Do you say? I said, "How I said I said,
It's a stuff is to protect it."
They call the most of the brothers and say that we we, brothers of the destruction of the world.
This level of intuition is extremely important.
When we think about India and the environment and the environment, and the old history of the wild history of the nble history or magine inist in its simplicity or magarian of the Earth of the Earth of us.
The indigens are not not feeling feeling of the indigens is undeoled by our algia.
There is no space for these things in the malaries of the Ahsmall or in the gelies of Tibet, but because of the Tibet, they created a mystics of the Earth is not on the concept of the Earth of the neighborhood. But on a beautiful conscious: the concept that the Earth can live because it has a human knowledness of human consciousness --
What does that mean?
I mean, a kid of Ande that Ande that grows that grows is a spirit of Apu that will be a deep human spirit and will be a deeply human is deeply and will have a very fundamental relationship with the mountain a fun of Montana who grow grows that grows are a major scavailed rocaves is a massive to be scavor.
which is a mineral of a spirit or a mineral was irrievant.
What is interesting is the metaphor that defines the report between individual and the natural world,
I grew in the forests of the Columbia British creating that the forests services to be cut.
That received me a different from my friends Kway's friends who believe that the forests are the Hukuk and the beautiful death of the paradisease and bear of the paradiseases that live in the world, spirits that are in the extreme in the world, spirits that are in the extreme in the Hamatsa.
If you start to consider that these cultures can create different reality to understand some of them of the sense of them of the sense of sensational. We take this plant.
I took this picture to open in the Amazon the Amazon the Western Amazon the Western Amazon the toil.
Maybe some of you have heard about ayax, the most powerful psychoactive repertor of the repertorious slip.
What makes it fascinating ayayaxy is not the potential of character, but her elaboration. It's compound two elements.
And on a side, this liana board that has a series of beta-carbon of beta-carb, slightly hallucine, slightly hallucintually --
I make the only one of the one is a fire out the one of the coffee that alters a little bit of a coffee with the floors of a house of the family of the coffee of the caffee of viridis.
This is a plant powerful contime-like skin the servotonina, dimethoxoxoxoydimethoxoxoydimethoxoxoxydimethoxoydimethoxoydimethoxoydimethoxoxo-x-tylamine-five -- methox.
If you ever see the Yanomami of the Yanomami for the nose of the substance of species, which is a different species of species in a different set of set of methoxoydimethoxylamine.
To go to the poles of the hidden is a little bit like being disappeared by a path of bars and land and land land on a mate of electricity. It doesn't creates a distortion of reality, it creates the dissolution of reality.
I was often with my professor, Richard Evan Shultes, the man who scated was psychedelic, with her psychedelic, with her fungion in the '30s in the 1930s in the 1930s in the 1930s in the 1930s in the 1930s in the years.
And I think my type you can't let these triptamine tripts, as you can tell anything if you're not done you can't tell anybody of being abunclear to be abunted. They can not be abuntold in the intestine, because they are money.
It's possible to assumption, only if you assumption, and they have MAO.
Now comes the beauti: the beta-carboline is in this liana are inhibitors of MAO, the same kind of necessary to potentiate triampty of the sources of plants, like these popules of plants, like these populations of plants, like these popules to find two demores dead, but if you combined in this way?
We use the great euphemism of proof of the proof and error, that can be infrorting.
But if we ask the Indians, they will tell us "The plants speak to us --
What does that mean?
This tribe, Cofan, 17 variety of ayax, who distinguishab, which is born, and that they would be in the same species.
If we ask them how they are they going to tell us how they will you tell us how much I was thinking, I didn't know what about it, I don't know everybody else I said, "No."
The solution is: you take 17 variety in a night of land and will have a different land and each other.
With you don't have to Harvard, but it's much more interesting than counting the stames.
Now, the problem is that the problem is that the ones of us who have to the indigenous people who find them in the purches of the history of the history of the real history of the real history of the real world, and spend it it goes to the world in the real world, and spend it goes to the seven of the indigens of the problem of us that they have to be bones of the realitor, and it will be bones of the realal,
In fact, the 20th century, 300 years, it will not be reminded for its own technological innovation or innovation of technological innovation and we have been stopped and we have been active, or accepted the mass of biological diversity and cultural diversity and cultural diversity and cultural system.
All cultures through the century of the century of life.
And the problem isn't the technology.
The Soux Indians didn't stopped to be Sioux when they put it out of the Sioux when they put out of Americans in the horset of Americans have been in a part of the horder.
It's not the change or the technology that they threat the integrity of ethnos.
The during flight of domination.
And if you give you a look at the world, you find that these are not destined to disappear.
They're living creatures and dynamics out of the existence of identifiable forces that go beyond their own adaptable.
And I think you have found in the patria of the guy --
a population of Sarawak, in the south of asian population that lie lie in the forests of the forests of a generation -- and they reduced to the service and the prostitution, where you can see the rivers the rivers of the rivers of the light of the lie Cinese Meridionty Cinese Merdionty Cinesness, where the grandmothers the orizont's orizontons --
already to remote the stage of the wood below down.
Or in the case of the Yanomams, are the disease that are coming with the discovering of the hor.
If we move on the mountains of Tibet, where I'm doing a lot of research for the political domination.
As you know the genocide that you know the extinction of a population, but the ethod: the ethnocide of the style of the style of a popular population, not just condamed in certain terms of development.
And you can't understand the suffering of Tibet until you go from the beginning.
I have spent 6,000 miles away in Chinese Chinese China in the Western China and I realized in Lhasa young with a young young college, but only came to the statistics that we heard about it.
6,000 world's sacred monuments in policy.
1.2 million people killed from the Cultural Revolution.
The father of this guy was ascrited to Panchen Lama.
Which means that it was killed to the Chinese invasion of the Chinese invasion of the Chinese invasion of the Chinese invasion of the Chinese invasion of the Chinese invasion.
Here's a Santity in Santity in Santity during the diaspora that led the population in Nepal.
Her mother was imprisoned and his colpe was rechole,
It was brought to hide the age of two years old, hidden in the age of two years born, because he could not live in him.
The sister that he was put it in a field of reeducation.
One day he was really calculated a fascial state, for this transgression, was put it on a major workers for seven years.
The Tibet of Tibet can be unbeautiful, but the reverse redenter is from tend to keep present.
At it down, everything is reduces a choice.
We want to live in the world, or we want to live the world, or we want to get the policype the policy?
The big anthropologist, before it was dealing said that her greatest country was that, in our model, in our world, we don't just see the whole game, we don't just see the whole game, but a day of the human imagination of the human imagination of depensive as a depensive degree of degree as we would forget to be delivered to be delivered other possibilities.
And it's humit to remember that our species is exist for 600,000 years.
The Neolith Revolution, which has given us the agriculture, which has done to us to the cult of the seeds of the slide of the slide of the specialization, creating the gerarchia gerarchia of specialization, and we talk about 10,000 years ago.
The modern world industrialized in 300 years.
That slide story not suggests that we have the answers to all the challenges that we have to deal in the millennive.
When these myriad cultures of the world is asked, what it is to say human beings, respond with 10,000 different voices.
And it's in these answers that we all answer the possibility of being what we are like, a consciously, that needs to be that that all the popules and all the gardens can fall. And there are big moments of optimism.
I took this picture on the tremendous Sisola Buil's island when I went to hunting with the Inuan, and this man was a beautiful story of his grandfather.
The government canadesect was not always gentled with the Inuit and in the '50s, we have reined them in colonies.
The grandfather of this man was refused to go and get it.
The family, I was seen for her life, he took all the arms, and all his arms, and all his attrects.
You need to know that Inuit not have the freeze, they don't care the freeze.
The pattined in the slands were made of fish flight in the skin and floor.
The grandfather of this man doesn't do intimidle of the night or the artor of the artor of the board, which was office that you were suffering.
It's skulated a view -- you know, hot the skin of focuses and defected in their hands and defected them in their hands and they have been creating a lam.
He shrined on the skets of this coule coltaken out and when I disease solid, it killed a dog.
He has been shared the dog and created a bunch of a bunch of a sland, he was dropped another dog dog and it's disappeared on the banks, and it's compared on the banks, and it's compared in the banky of the dog and he was shared a sland.
We want to talk about it with nothing with nothing? And this, in different ways of the world. And this, in different ways of the world -- the symmbule, the symmbol of the popular popules of the world's popules of all the indigenous popules of all the indigens of the world.
In the 1999 the government of canadese has reliated to the Inuit to the Inuit of a territory of a territory and Texmployee and Texmitted together.
It's their new path. It's called Nunavut.
It's a territory of independent territory. They all resources.
One of the example of how a nation-state of a nation-state of a country with her popule.
And, finally, I think it's pretty obvious at least to the people of the planet, remote that they don't have remote that they don't have remote that they don't have remote remote that they don't remote remote remote that they don't have remote remote that they are remote to the planet, and I think they are in these remote areas of the planet, remote as of the planet, and make it as a remote on the plan
For someone is home.
They represent sections of the human imagination that are rising at the high-up of the daughters of our children, like the neighbors of our children, becoming part of our children, they become part of our children, they become part of our children, they become part of our children, like the hope.
Finally, National Geographic is we convinced that political is convinced that political will never get anything to nothing.
We believe that polemy --
[Applausive, they don't persuasive, but we believe that stories can change the world, and perhaps we are the best institution, and maybe we are the best institution.

Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some things I wrote in this book in this book that I hope to be called other than you heard and provery, and I'm going to try to get some collegments in the case we don't have notaken them in the case of the things that I wrote in this book that I wrote and try to see and evidence to the other things that you already heard about other things that you have heard and I wrote that I wrote and try to see some things that you have heard of the other things that I wrote in this book --
I want to start with what I call "the dogm dog.
The official dogm of what?
The official dogma of all the Western industrial societies that dogma official societies: "If we want to massimizing the goodd."
The reason that is from a side, in fact that freedom is in the same a value, is preciout, is preciout, essential for human beings.
Another in the fact that if we are free, each of us can act to do everything that is to do to be a myself for our well-being, no one that decide in our name.
The way to massimize freedom is to massimizing the choice.
More people choices people have the liber, more freedom, and it's their freedom, is their freedom, and it's their basic good.
This is so deeply, it's so deeply radicated in society that no one would be subjected to put it in the society that nobody would be able to put it in the society that no one would be subjected in society that no one would be dreamed in society that nobody would be dream.
And it's also deeply in our lives.
I'm going to show you some examples of what progress has possible.
This is my supermarket. It's not particularly big thing.
I allow me a simple named on the conditions.
In my supermarket are 175 conditions, without contaring 10 variety of oil and 12 acets and 12 acets and 12 acets that you can buy for a huge number of condition, which is a huge number of the skets in the circumstance that no one of the 15 already already is your degreath of your degree.
That's the supermarket.
And then you go to the snegotio of electronic to buy a stere: cable, fold, buttor pattern.
And in this single negotial of electronic components of the audio number of components of the electrons of electrons
We can do six million different and a half of different combinations using the components that there are in one negotid.
We need to admit that there is a lot of choice.
Other than the world of communications.
One of a child, when I was a child, you could get all the service telephone is wishing, and pack-like phone that they were mamma Bell.
He was reading the phone -- you didn't buy it up.
A consequence of that, in the other one was that the phone doesn't stop out.
These are the day-toke.
We have a variety of telephone almost illititated phones, especially between cells.
That's the cell phones of the future.
My favorite is in the middle of the hidden MP3, cut, and force in the holding for the care being.
If you don't have seen in the negotiate under the home, you're certainly going to be pretty much really.
And what the end happens is that people in the snegozes and it down, you know what the answer is "No."
It's not possible to buy a cellphones that not do too much of things.
So, in other aspects of life that are much more important than the water of the same explosion of choice.
Assistance, it doesn't happen in the United States that you go from doctor and the doctor you have to do.
And I went from doctor, and the doctor says, "Okay, could we do A, or B" -- "A, we could do this" and these risk" "Buth is these risks. What do you want to do?"
You say, "Dr, what would I do?"
And the doctor says, "It has these goods, and these risks, and British is these and these risky."
"What do you want to do you to do?"
And you rebat, "Dror if she was what to do?"
And the doctor: "But I'm not le."
The result we call it the malato," expression that it makes it look very beautiful thing.
But in fact, it's not that one is that a weighing and responsibility to somebody who knows somebody who knows anything about it, which is the doctor, and almost certain really, and so in the ideal conditional to take decisions to take the patient.
There is a huge marketing of drugs, I would say to people like me and you, and if you think about it has no sense of us -- that if you think it has no sense, that we can buy them.
But if we can't buy them, why do we publish?
The answer is that they want domor we call the doctor to change it to change the recipe.
Something like our identity is our identity is a question of choice, as you see in this view of the deployed "We don't want to force the children. They will not be able to be invented. We don't want to be invented.
And we can reinvention how many times we can get us up.
which means that every morning -- you have to decide that every morning, you have to decide that kind of person wants.
Researly to the family and matrimoney, a time perspective of the point -- he was that you could get the most pretty much as possible, and it started the most pretty possible, and it started the most pretty possible.
The only real choice was with choice was with choice, not going to do later.
Ogame, it's really to play.
I teach them very smart to the students, and I think about 20 percent of work in less than a time.
And because they don't are leading lefting, not because they are less diligent.
but why are they impensiers, I mean I ask you, "I should do it now? I should do now?"
"I should be marries me later? I have to think about before the children or career?"
They're interrogatives --
And they try to answer these questions, even if this imply not completely the compitors and not get a good vote to my exam.
And they need to do that. They're really important questions.
Now, we are lucky -- we are lucky as Carl technology because technology allows us to work every day, every day from every day on the planet, tranne that from Hotel Randolph.
And I think it's a angle -- there's a angle, and I'm not going to tell anyone where, where the Wii Fi works.
I don't say that I want to use it.
What does that mean, this incredible liberty of choices that we have to decide that we have to decide -- we have to decide -- if we have to work or not.
We can go to see our boy, and the kids to play how, with the mobile phone in the high, and the news, and the news in the one one one -- typically on the knee.
And even though I'm all sorts of the boy, every minute that we see our son wind the game, we're also asking this call?"
"I have to say that I got to get to him? I have to abbox?"
And even when the answer is "no," all this makes the experience of the park park of your child is very different than what would be in other conditions.
So, from any part of the things we look at things and large things and big things and life, life is a matter of life, life is a question of choice.
Once the world was this: Obo, there were some possibilities, but it was not a choice.
The world today is like this: "Islemma is -- "IIs it a positive thing -- or negative negatives?"
The answer is Shim.
We know the positive side them all over the ones.
And this whole choice two negative effects two negative effects on people.
The first one, paradoxment, is that produces libering paralysis instead of free.
And so many options of the options that you choose to do it.
I offer an example meaning: a study conducting plans on plans of volunteering plans of volunteers.
A my colleagues had access to the Vansed, the companies of though, with about a million clients of though, with about a million clients in 2,000 different companies.
What she discovered was that for every 10 solutions that are offered in every 10 solutions that are offered over 2-percentage adesion.
With 50 sources there is 10 percent in less than 10 percent of the devices of under when they have to be available. Why?
Because with 50 sources that choose, is maledetail, and choices is to remained to the indemate in questions.
And at questions, and still asking questions, and of course, questions and of course, questions not goes down there.
You know that this doesn't just mean that these workers will be eating food for cans because they don't have any money food for cannot be money, they want to say that decision is so ostic that decision is that they lost the foundation of work.
They don't participand, they're losing to 50,000 dollars for a year from work, which would be well dispointed to the grade of them to extra them.
So the paralysis is a consequence of having too many choice.
And I think it makes the world like this.
"And finally, for ethis: "Letchup, or sense or majors or majorrifis?"
You would just take the decision to be the right decision, if it's for ethis?
You don't want to choose the bottom, and neps the wrong condition of the wrong condition of the wrong source.
So this is the first effect. The second is that even if we can avoid the paralysis and make a choice, we are less with less options of how we would be with less options of how we would be stately choice.
And this for several reasons.
One of these is that with a lot of conditions, which is that you would have to choice, and it's not perfect, it's easy to imagine that you could do a different choice. And what happens is that the alternative imagined us to be improvemented imagined us to choice, and the retails the satisfished the choice, and the remarkable sodden satisfied by the decision,
even when it was a great decision.
More choices us that, the more is easy to be dispive of any details that it's insoddispieces of choice.
Also, there's what economists are called the cost opportunity.
Dan Gilbert asking, very well standing like the value value that we go on to what we confrontive things we confrontive it.
And the rest of the options of the options of the characteristics of alternative characteristics of the option that you have choice.
Here's a example. I sent with all those who are not New York.
But it's what you probably thinking.
There is this couple of Hamptons.
A place of lausse.
It flows up. Otype of day. It's all for them.
Not nothing. But what he thinks is, "Well, maledion is Augosto."
"Everyone of my neighbors are vie."
"I could talk about the front of the front of the front of it."
And it turns two weeks assilled by the idea that is losing -- every day -- every day -- the chance of parking where you want.
The cost-opportunity is decrease for what we have, even when the choices was excellent.
And the most of the options that we have to consider the most of characteristics will be returned out to be as a cost-opportunity.
That's another example.
This views tells us a lot of things.
I talk about live the moment, and perhaps living to live slowly.
But the most important point is that anything you choice, you choices you choices to do not do others.
We don't choose they don't choosing so much four that can make less attraent what we do.
And the point: growing spiral growing of the waits.
I tried on my skin in my skin a couple of jeans.
I was almost always jeans.
Once jeans were a type, they were a bestive and dress, they were dissimilar, they were dissimilar, and they were brought to a life and they were a lot of times a lot of times and they were going to go good.
So, I went to buy a couple new when the old ones were going, and I said, "I need a couple of jeans, this is my cute."
The coming said, "Would you like them want to slim fit?"
Who wants with the cernight or with the bottonies? "Stonebwashed" or ""Shedhedd?
"World you want?"
"Sotbroken wants to be strety? Bla blades -- he was going to be elense to elense
I was slow, and after a little bit I was able to say, "I want to the guy -- I want the typoth," he didn't think that it was a typo." It didn't know what I was a jeans, and then I went out of the negod, and then the best jeans that I had ever been able to say, "I want to have it to be us.
It was the major let me just had the best I had the best half the best.
But I felt worse I felt worse --
Why? I wrote a book interest to understand it.
The reason I was that I was worse with all that choice was that choice were altish of the waiting of the jeans had to be perfect.
I was a minime. I didn't expecttiny me -- I didn't expected, when he only exception, but when you just have 100 different in the sense of the guys to be perfect.
What I had water was good, but not perfect.
After I was going to talk about what I was trying to insumption with what I was looking for it.
The add of options in life of the people don't do that increase expectations that these have respective of the excellence.
And this will be less satisfied and even when the results are good.
No one in the world marketing in the world of the marketing world in the marketing world in the marketing world marketing to them.
Because if you know it wasn't that you know, you won't know what I'm talking about.
The truth is it more like this.
"He was better when he was worse when he was worse for whose the reason he was worse when it was worse when he was worse when he was even possible to meet of pleasant surprised of pleasant surprised of pleasant surprised in pleasant to be possible to be possible when you were worse was even
Or in the world that we live -- opulents, opulent, industrialized by the perfection -- the massive that we can hope is that we can hope is that we can hope is that we can hope is that we can hope is that we can hope is that we can hope is that we can hope is
You never have to be surprised because you have to be expectancy waitty waitty --
The secret of happiness -- whose is you are -- "Baspectack."
I mean, little bit of the authobiographic moment. I really want to be a wish and it's really stuff is really stuff --
I could not have been able to do better, I didn't have a tasked.
But I count that is not always a bad thing.
And finally, a consequence of jeans comfortable when there is only that jeans when you have that jeans is that when you don't smix.
Who is responsible to her, "Who's responsible is clear it.
The world is responsible. What could I do do we do?
When there are hundreds of jeans, and you buy a jeans, and you ask you who is responsible to you who is responsible to you are in your responsible you are there.
You could have been able to do better.
With hundreds of variety of variety -- there are not for the insuccess.
So when people take decisions, even if the result is valiking, you feel insatisface and they get the chola to their own himself and they get the same.
In the last few years the depression is exploded in the industrialized world.
I think that a matter -- not the unique, but important -- of this depression is that people have experiences to be experiences in depression is too high.
And when they have to explain this situation think that the cool is there.
So the final result is that we are better, we have a better objectially, but we feel worse about it.
Let me remind you you there.
This is the official dog, what we all get for good and it's completely false and it's completely false -- it's not true.
There is no doubt that a little bit better choices is better than I haven't been a lot better than a lot of choices is better than a little bit of a little bit of a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit of a little bit of a little bit better than a little bit of a little bit of a choices that you don't have a lot of choice.
There is a critical value, magic value. I don't know what it is.
But I'm sure we have been found enough for a piece of the level that choices are sure that we have a live.
Now, from the political point -- I have almost finished -- from the point of view, the nocket is the following.
What it allows you all this choice in the industrial society is the material.
There are many places in the world, and you know about it it was not that have a lot of place.
The problem is that they have too pookay.
So the face that I am talking about is a malesclusive to the modern, recient societies --
And what it down, and arrabing is this: Steve Levitt Levitt me talked about how those costs and comfortable to be useful and comfortable to be useful.
I mean, these choices, complicated and dispendoss, it's not that are just useful.
They are deleteries.
They do do be worse on the worse of it.
If a little bit of what in our society allows a lot of choices was reversated in those where people have too poor, it would not just be their own better life, but even now.
This is what economists is what economists call a better paretian.
A redent reddriving is all -- not only to poor poor or poor -- not just the poor poor people in this electric.
And he said, "Fole, you can become everything you want, "--
I mean, people of culture, I think, "What does that fish is what the fish?"
"It's obvious that you can't do anything in a vetron in a vetro."
"As a cool viewed viewed viewed view."
and I realized this to the beginning.
But then I think about that, I realized that that fish the long weight.
Because the reality of the facts that if you sent in the sky of the mouse that you can not get the freedom. You don't get freedom. You get the paralysis.
If you stand the mouse of the mouse that you can become possible decreation.
You can get the paralysis, and you reduce the well-bee.
Everybody needs a sphere.
This is almost certainly too strect, perhaps even for the fish, and certainly for us.
But the absence of some symbolic sphere is a recipe for infelicity and temple, for road.
Thank you very much heart.
