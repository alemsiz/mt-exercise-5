And the last year I showed these slide to show that the topics that the tacial calot. And for almost three million years had the size of 48 million years had the size of 40 million years on has been restreted.
This is the falling the gravity of the problem because it doesn't show the of, because it doesn't show the beginning of the ice ice ice of the ice problem because it doesn't show the same.
The art glacial climbing is, in a sense, the heart cup of the global climate system.
You expands and writing and writing the expand.
The next slide will be a rapid rapid of the last 25 years.
The gaiacus.
As you see, you know, you can see the blue scream.
That's the ice in invert, which is the ice in wind, which is the size of the outside of the summmer.
You can see the ice that the ice called the ice ice ice ice ice lock of five years or more, is like the blood of the body out of the body.
In 25 years was spent from this to this.
This is a problem because the interested land the icro-around the ocean where there are huge amount of carbon and conged that we have enormous amount of carbon and conged that they are meters in meters and put it from the microbies.
Rempt to the totality of the atmospheric warming global warming that quantity could radouble, super-write amount of write.
In some of the laghi deep in Alaska metan he's already reboiling from water.
The professored professored Katey Walter the University of Alaska team in a team in the team of the University of the University of Alaska team in the University of Alaska team of Alaska team in the University of Alaska team in the University of Alaska team in the University of Alaska
Video: Wow! Al Gore: The question is if we are going to be the way we will be the now.
A motive, this is that this exchange the Greenland surround of the north Greenland from the northern northern north.
This is a glacial river.
The levels had never reached with similar levels.
This is the Kangerlerlusaq, in the so-east Greenland.
If you want to know how the level of the gap for the gaic level of the gather, is where the sea.
These are running fasting.
An other part of the planet: Antart, the most block of ice block on the planet.
The month last months the scientists have dichied that the balance of ice is in negative, and that the Antarcticaround, which is particularly running in the sheets of the under ballock of the sheballock of the shef.
It's a six feet of water level of water as Greenland.
Himalaya, the third largest block of ice block in the ice, you see new gaacross the glacium -- a few years ago were ice.
The 40 percent of the world's population was going to be a tough of the world's point from the shape.
Her Ande: this ice is the fund water of this city.
The led is increased up.
But when you diminises the same across the water potable.
In California the neve Sierra Nevada is diminuths of 40 percent.
The hydrops are in crisis.
The predictions, as you have a leck -- are graved.
The growing growing world door a needle increasing increasing income.
The environmental disasters are increasing a record out of the normal and without precedent.
Four times more number of the last 30 years of respect to the 75.
This is a whole thing of unsustainable to it.
If you look at it in the historical context of the wells of it.
In the last five years we added 70 million tons of CO2 million tons of tons in the oceans every day.
Look at the Eastern Pacific Pacific American Eastern America, where there's a radical parts of the continent where there is a radical impoor, where there's a radical imposition.
The major global warming warming together with the deforestation, which is the only only for it is the combustic use.
The oil is a problem, and the carbon is a bad worse is even worse
The United States are one of the most emissions, together with the most emissions, together.
And it was proposes to build a lot of other carbon and furniture
But we're assisting a shift change.
These are the annononothing in the last few years and some alternative motions of green projects
At every way, there's a political lotta in our country.
The carbon and oil industries and oil industries have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote the carbon and is a host hoxymore.
The image reminded me reminded me something,
Natal, in Tennesessee, where I live an allowed 3.8 billion lithers of caron.
Maybe you saw it on the news of the news.
This is the second largest flow of scories in America.
It's happened around Natmal --
The natalizing public industries of carbon industries was thise.
Video: Prosty the carbon is a ballock and happy.
It's sent here in America, and it makes our economy.
Frosty carbon is more and more and more and more and more clean.
It's precised and workers keep the workers are kept the style stick.
Al Gore: Do here is a lot of the West Virginia.
The largest society on the mountains is Massey Coal. This is his amministrator.
Video: Don Blands: I'm going to be clear, Nancy Pelocal Gore, Harry Reid -- they don't know what they're talking about.
Al Gore: So the Alleance for the Clim Protein the Clim of the Clim of the countries.
This is a part of it.
Video: Actor: At COALery see the climate changes like a minate climate in our business.
So our priority is invest a great amount of money in a public effort and confuses the trum truth.
In fact, the carbon is not sport.
We think it is a good progress -- it also has a good profum.
So not preocupated of climate change.
Let me do you do it.
Video: Acle: Carbon -- you heard -- you heard a lot of talking about a lot of
So let's do you take a game structure in a structure of the carbon of the carbon for the carbon the carbon the carbon fall.
One of the cars are a little roy-belcharging technology of the carbon technology of the carbon technology of the carbon technology
The carbon is between the main is between the main causes of global warming and the needs of the carbon that you see change.
Dake a ey: this is the goal technology of carbon digital technology
Al Gore: Infinally, the positive alternative questions to the economic issue and the national issue and the national security issue.
Video: H: The America, is in crisi; the national security climate the national security climate climate climate climate climate climate it.
The film that college college all of the connection from the combustible combinable and the important.
Now, there's a new new audience, you know, solution for the cirn.
Like America: 100-percent energy energy in the 10 years.
They plan to put America to work, making ourselves the work, and helping the global warming the global warming.
Finally, a solution that is a solution that is solution to solve our problems.
Like America. You cover more more.
Al Gore: This is the ultimate here.
Video: H: It's about to reduce energy to America.
One of the faster ways to bring the dependence from the combustible that are kills that kills our planet.
All of the future is here. Vent, one new energy network.
She looked at the well-investment for the good work of well.
M: Repower America. It's time to be realists.
Al Gore: A old old old you says, "If you want to go to the sun.
If you want to go away to away.
We have to go away to move away at it.
Thank you very much.
The year last year, I had an introduction on the LHC.
And I promise to go back to how machine.
So I got out here. And for those who are not there was no one of the other scientific experiment of the scientific experiment -- 27 kilometers of surrounded surrounds of circumstom.
His compiece is to reconditions that were less than a billion second from the beginning of the universe -- until 600 million times a second.
And that's just the environment.
This is the Gineva.
We photographing these mini-Big Bang Big Bang Big Bang Big Bang Big Bang Big Bang Big Bang Big Bang Big Bang Big Bang Big Bang Big Big Bang Big Bang Big Bang Big g g Big Bang Big Bang Big Bang Big Big Big Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Big g g W.
This is what I work. It's called ATLAS -- is 44 feet and has a diameter of 22 feet and has a diameter of 22 feet in a half feet of 22 feet and has a diameter diameter of 22 feet and has a diameter of 22 feet and a diameter of 22 feet of feet and has a diameter of 22 feet and has a diameter diameter of 22 feet and has a diameter diameter of 22 feet and have a diameter diameter diameter diameter diameter diameter diameter diameter diameter diameter diameter of 22222222222 femets and wormetr.
This is a spectacular image of ATLAS in building so you can notice the proportions.
The 10 settember 10 settember the car for the first time.
And this picture was taken by ATLAS.
It was causing the control of the control.
It's a picture of the first particles that had done all the around of the LHC, and deliberately, deliberately, with a part of the LHC, and differy particles inside the relaw in the relaw in the relaevator.
In other words, when we see that picture the 10 set, we realize that the machine works, which is a great life.
I don't know if it was to do it more opposed to Google and saw this when somebody went to Google and saw that the beginning was this thing.
That means we had a cultural impact of the scientific impact that scientific impact.
About a week later was a problem with the machine, had to these movies here -- these movies -- these movies -- these movies -- these movies -- these movies -- these movies -- these movies -- these movies have to have a problem with the machine, it had to these files here -- these movies in the machine, it was a problem with the machine.
These movies 13,000 ample when the machine works in the machine works in the power.
Now, technicians between you look at the movies and say, "It's not true. I'm not true.
And they can do it because when they're very quickly cosidate mountaining mouns.
So, at less 271 degrees, at a inferior temperature in the stars, these movies can bring that corring.
In one of the most of the most innovement of the most of the magnets in the LHC, there was a defection of fabrication.
So the movies are surrounded up and 13,000 ample lights, and 13,000 ample light buly to be electrical resistance.
This was the result.
Now, this is even more impression, if you think these magnets fishing more than 20 tons and moved over 20 centimeters.
They are damage about 50 magnets.
We had to take a touch of what we did we do it.
We have them repristine and add recently
They're now back to their place under to their place under land.
Entro the end of the marze, the LHC will be new integrate to
We let it and we expect to get the data or juging or him, and continue so our wind or hundred and furniture that are the universe.
Now, of course, in a certain four-way of the debate of science and engineering the value of science and engineering. It's easy to confuture it.
I think the fact that it is so difficult to go over over the limits, I think is the value of things like LHC.
I want to conclude with the words of a scientist, Humphrey Davy, Humphrey Davy, which is involved experiments of his cleaning in the inuse."
Thank you.
I want to start asking you to think about here, as kids to be playing here, from kids, you play coins with the morning.
And as you figure out how to get them and realize them, and take them and move them and move them and resolve problems and resolve problems and eat thinking and eat relationships and manipulating relationships and relationships relationships and skills and sling them to be able and resolve them to be able and resolve them to be able to realize and sing them to be able and sunging space.
The spacal reason is prophones is deeply to the way we understand part of the world around us.
So, by informing inspired by using the useal with physics, together with physics, together to my consult in my county Pack Kalanith, I started asking myself with the hands of the mouse as well-hand-to-hand is a computering bad that is moving on a now, we have a a lot of a handle that we have a little bit of a hand-now,
and we can do it our please?
The question was so interesting that we decided we decided we decided to explore the answer to the answer to the Siftable.
In a few words, a Siftable computer is a big whole whole thing like a big discover.
In a few words, a Siftable computer is a big whole whole thing like a big discover.
You can move them with the hand, can "see" in the milar and they have a screen and have a screen and a screen and a wireless.
But more physics, as the morning, as the morning objects, you can just move to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able objects.
The See is the example of a new ecosystems for manipulate information for the digital information
And as they get more physics, consciousness of the motion, of the others of the motion, and as they get more physics, and as we can get more physics, how we can motion, we can explore new style and fun and fun and funny different stiles of interaction.
I'm going to start some simple example.
This is a See of See is configuring video -- if you can including it in a direction, if you can including out of other parts of back.
These interactive riticians are conscious about others.
If you are interested in what they are interested in the midle of it.
If they come circumstomer and can agitate a little bit of it.
If they come circumstomer and can agitate a little bit of it.
They also have their movement and inclination.
We realized that one of the interesting interesting implications of the interaction was the power to use the data, "Dor, "She can be a liquid.
In this case, we have three Siftconfigurated as seces and use them to use them to be in the central central central central central where they mix of the color.
and I can use them for the color in the central central central where they mix mix.
If we can get too much more than we can put a little bit of place.
There's also beautiful chance of learning, like language and games and games where people can try to try and play things to try and see the results and see the immediately.
Now I'm --
This is a Fibonaction that I do with a program of equations.
Here we have a game of words that is in Scarabeo and Boggle.
For any turn to every turn See a letter in every Siftable, Pratically, at every turn Siftable, and you get a house on every Siftable, and as certain words of a ditionary.
And then after about 30 seconds remissing and you have a new set of lects, and new possibilities of skills to try to prove and new possibilities to try to be able and new possibilities of lecture.
Thank you.
Here's the children came to the Media Lab, I did it in the Media Lab, I did a video.
They are a lot of the pleasures.
And one of the interesting things about this genuine application is that you don't have to give people a lot of education
You just have to say, "Lipones of words, and they know what to do.
Here's the other people who tried it.
This is our most youngest beta young bete.
He just wanted to be implant.
They just were hard to him, for him.
Now, this is a application of a interactive card.
We wanted to build a tool for the appreciate language in Lui is Felix.
It can inserve new characters in the scene, realizing the Siftable to their associated associated
It can inserve new characters in the scene, realizing the Siftable to their associated associated
And it's doing the sunning the sun.
Video: The only is is smit sunging.
David Merrill: She took a treat in the scen.
Video: The treatment is the around.
Bel work!
So schooling Siftable and put them close to the people --
Video: Bau!
-- by inventing their story.
Video: Cia!
DM: It's a final story with the open-up story as you wouldn't do him as you woul.
DM: It's a final story with the open-up story as you wouldn't do him as you woul.
Video: Vole, you know, I live it.
DM: The last example I have the time to show you is a tool, recently detect and execraft-recently and exectic execraft.
It's a tool, recently recently recently and execknew and exective music.
The See skin here across the battery-based and bacteria.
Every one of these has four different variations, and you can get to be using.
You can inserve these sound sound in a sequence to your pleasant to your please.
And to modificate it to make a sound "sound like "sequence."
These are effects that you can control from live and the film and the film and too much of the movie.
And then you attacks to a particular and then including it.
And then there are the general effects as time and volum, which is applicate in the sequence.
We look at how it works.
Video: DM: We're going to start a base in two Siftable "sequenca," we are the system, the extremendous sil.
Now I put a basic line.
Video: DM: A: At of the percent ussion --
Video: DM: And I'm going to put the movie of bacteria, so I can control the effect of the live.
Video: DM: I can know the whole sequence the whole sequence of the time from one or the other.
Video: DM: And now I'll add the movie to the base to date expression.
Video: DM: I can can recombination the sequence of the facting."
So I didn't have to plan the first time, but I can try and make it more and cord.
And now, finally, I can get the whole sequence the whole sequence inclining the Siftable to the Siftable "volume."
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is build new man-machine interfaces of the bigger and more looks like our brain and body.
And I had time to show you one of the results of this percorporate and some possibilities that we try to bring out of the lab.
The concept I want to transmit you is that is coming this new generation of objects for the digital objects in the digital media that we want to information in our world we want.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the time to talk to everybody with you.
They're a written written
And we can write books is my profession, but it's more than then, of course.
It's also love and the fasine of my life.
And I don't expect that can change it.
But as I said something particular happened in my life and careers, and my careera, which leaded me to recalibrate the whole whole reality with this work.
The particular thing is I recently recently this book, this biography called "Mangia, Ama" whatever he was in the world and became a cedentually, for some reason for some reason in the world and became a big sensational.
And the result is that everywhere you go to now, people treating me as if I were convicted to me.
It's true -- convicted, convict!
They come from me and saying, "You don't have purpose and said, "You don't afraid to be able to do it?
You can't afford to continue write for the whole life without power to create a book that can be able to create a book that can importing somebody who can importing somebody who can importing somebody who can importing somebody who can can be able to create a book that can be able to create a book that can be able to create a book that can be able to create a book that can be able to do somebody in the whole life without power to create a
that can important somebody who can do you do that?"
It's running absolutely he's running up.
But it could go worse and worse that I remember 20 years ago, when I started to say to people -- I was a adolescent -- I wanted to be a written -- I wanted to be a written of the rectric.
I met it to the same reaction of the fear.
And people say, "Don't do you can't have success?
You don't fear that the upon rific rifid of kills you know?
You can't fear to do this mestiate the whole life without any swimming on a heart of horming and die of the mouth of holds with the mouth of falling?"
And so you know.
The answer -- the short answer to all of these questions is, "Si."
I fear of all of those things.
I always had pain.
And I've also fear of many other things that people might not have to ine.
As a algae and other things sprains and other things space.
But as I think about writing what I thought and I was asked myself to be the last one of course, is why is?
Is it it?
It's logical that anybody to expect to be expected by a work that you feel that you feel like to do it.
But what is so particular in the impresection creative to make us to be nervous about the mind of the mental degree in a way that other career doesn't do?
How do my father, for example, he was a chemical engineer and not rememical to be in his 40 years of activity where he was asked if he was to be able to engineer to be engineer to be eneking?
It never -- that block of the engineer John, like what?
It didn't work?
Onestly, the engineers as group as group of the secoals, as group of burns to be hilized alcohyacks.
We have writers -- we have this reputation, and not only writers but not only growers but creative of every general reputation of being enormously instable to be enormous instable.
And it is not going to look at the tristop of the deaths of the magnific deaths that only in the 2th century, they die and often for them, and often for them, and often for them,
And the ones who don't have to be really discovered by their women.
Norman Mailer, before in the last interview said, "I my book said, "Ogny book me a little more." And the extraordinary extraordinary remarkable to work of their life.
But we don't bad when we heard about why we heard these things that are so long than we have these things that we were completely interior and accepted the notion that the creativity and the nation that creativity and the art of the art, and it will always connect to the angood.
And the question I want to do all of the thing is you agree with this ide?
It goes out this thing -- because it looks like it -- because it looks at me not good for me to nothing this suppose is not good for this suppose --
I think it's hodiose.
And I think it's dangerous and I don't want to see it in the next century.
I think it's better encourage our big minds creative to live.
And I know that in my case -- in my home -- it would be very dangerous to beginning to the feeling of the substances that are in my careers, surrounded the circumstances where I am in my careera.
Obly -- I looked at it, I'm pretty young and I've about 40 years.
I still have about four workers in me.
And it's very likely to write now, and then will be right now going to be right from the world as the work that used by the world that I used to be success of my last book.
I'm going to be sket, because we're all most or friends here -- is likely my greatest success is to my greatest success is to my ballocks.
Oh, Gesus, who I think.
You know this is the kind of thinking that leads a person starts to begin to the morning.
I would continue to do this work that we do.
So, the question becomes doing?
And so I seed up with a lot of reflections, that the way to work to write a psychological costruction of protective psychological cool, OK?
I have to find a distance of safety that I'm writing in me, which I'm writing to me, and my natural reaction that I written the time I was trying to get out of the last year I started to look through the time in how to do it starts to look through the time with the best ideas to see if they could have the most best ideas to see if they could have the most best ideas of ideas that I started looking for the most of ideas sane of ideas that I started to find out if they started to have the best ideas that I started to have the best ideas to be
how to help people creativity to creativity emotional risks emotional creativity.
And that researching me to the ancient Great and Roma.
You know, I get them because of the garbing and then back.
In the ancient Grecia and old Rome -- people don't seem to believe that creativity came from men from men from man, OK?
It was thought that creativity was this spirit is that they were spiried with a few divine distant and disappears and unknown for distants and unknown away.
They were called these grees called these divines are the demons."
Socrate, wonderful of course, he believed to have a demit that elargives snewisdom.
The Romans were the idea, but they called the kind of spirit without a genius.
The big is that the Romans didn't think that a geniius was somebody particularly smart that a smart of smart that a smart that a genius.
They believed that a genius was this kind of divine that had been living in the walls of the studio of the studio Dobby, like the elf, like the elf, and that was out of the work of the arms of the artist of the work of the result of the result of that work.
Exctional -- this is the distance of which is the psychological psychological psychological that psychological psychological psychological psychological construction that is work.
And they all knew that was so that he was so that working, right?
So the antic artists were protected by certain thing, like for example, how for example, right?
If your work was exceptional was not able to take all the market, everybody knew that was helped by this genius.
If your work fail, it was not all your whole whole thing your own own own own your work?
They knew they knew that was your genius to be a inabilities.
And so people have conceived the creativity in Occident for a long time.
And then the Rinascise came and all of change, and it changed this great idea; we put the human human being; we put the human beings and no longer and no longer and no longer and no longer and no longer and less and write the divinity.
This was the principle, and the rational existing and people started thinking that creativity came completely from the ishing creativity from the ispher.
And for the first time in history, you get it to this or that artist as a genius as a genius with genius.
And I have to tell them, I think it was a big error.
I think that allow somebody to believe a simple person to believe that as the fun, as the fun, the essence and the source of all my mysteries and etherness, inknown and etherness, inknown is a mostly too much of fragile to be a mostly too much to the fragile of human and ef.
It's like to ask somebody to engineer the sun.
And it is and distores completely the ego and creates all of these expectations on performance.
And I think it was this pressure that artists in the pass the 500 years.
And if that's true, and I think it is the question, and now?
Can we do it different?
Maybe to go back to a more antics of the relationship between human and mystery creative across the mistake.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we can't cancell 500 years of rational thinking in a 18 minutes.
And there is probably people in the audience that would suspects of scientific susps on the notion of the notion that they follow people who are following successful projects.
I'm going to be not convincing you all about this thing.
But the question I want to ask is -- why do we do?
Why don't you think it in this way?
Because it has more sense of every other thing that I've ever heard to explain the exxury of creative process.
A process that has ever been trying to do something -- so fundamentally, all of the way -- yet, you don't behave.
And in fact, it can seems completely paranormal seems completely paranormal
I did this met with the extraordinary poeter Ruth Stone who has 90, but it was a poeter for the whole life and he said that during his life and said that during his childhood in the rural Virginia, working out of the countries was working out of the countries was a poetry of the countries was going to be in the countries was the exactly with the countries of the country's exactly in the countries of the countries of the countries of the existing ex
He said that was like a frage tren.
And that was going to rotate to her landscape.
You hear it comes to the ground under the land under the land under of his feet.
He knew what to do to do to that point and it was to do it and he was says, "Look like a morning.
And so it comes home and came home and came up with this poetyet, and it wouldn't have to be a piece of paper and a fairly hard in the fast, as the translate and and the page and the page and the page on the page.
Sometimes couldn't be enough fast, so corres and running and corres and poetring the roten rolled through and poetry the roten and poetry the roten and would continue through the landscape of the landscape of the landscape of the other poet."
And then there were those times -- this piece of the time -- I never forget -- there were the moments where it was almost losing at almost losing --
So, he was running and was trying to stand was trying to the card and poetry was going through and poetry was in the walking, and then said, he was going to be in the past and the off.
And the offer was the poetry from the codle and reput it in his body and turned it into the page.
And in these cases, the poetry would be presented on the perfect and intacts and intacts but at the first thing to the first one of the word to the first one of the word of the word of the word to the first one of the word of the perfect page.
So when I felt him -- it's prazy equal to my process to my design process.
Not my creative process -- I'm not a convict!
I'm a mul, and my way to work out is to work and do it with the same horary every day and work and work and go and get it and go up and get us and go up and get it up.
But even in my head, in my textboard, I was slightly against that thing, sometime.
And imagine that many of you have a lot of you do it.
You know, if the work and ideas and ideas and ideas and ideas I could not know that.
And what is this thing?
And how can we relate to that we don't have the head, but we do not lose your head, but it makes us sanik?
And as I realized the best example of the Musician musician that I have been Musist musician I interviewed years ago for a day.
We were talking about this, and you know, Tom, and you know, Tom, for the major of life has been the incarnation of the artist of the artist of the emporary artist of creative emporary creativity.
But then he was taken up, and a day day as he was driving on the under autotion in Los Angeles, changed it all for him.
He was going to be very quickly and a tract tract of melodia, which is going to be in his heads as the inspiration, elusive and end, you know, and the want, you know, it's wonderful and the desire, but not how to take it.
It has no paper piece of paper, it has no mathematic.
So it starts to hear this kind of old old old old old old in him, "I'm going to lost for losing up with this song, and I'll remarring from this song.
I'm not good enough and I can't do it."
And instead of going to stop up.
I'll give the whole whole new mental process and did something completely new thing.
He just looked at the sky and said, "Sore, you can't see what I'm driving I am driving?"
"You seems that can write a song hour?
If you really want to exist, it will go back to a more opportunity when I can take care of you.
And so, you get to the important.
You go to disturbing Leonard Cohen."
And his worker changed after this.
Not the work, the work was still as you seed.
But the process and fishing the ancient was released when the genius, the genius, the genius that was out of him, and the genius was going back where it was not to be a remaintained back where it was was not to be a thing thing and mented it was a whole thing and mented.
But this is a piece of conversation with a conversation between Tom and a conversation between Tom and external conversation and external thing that allowed was not Tom.
So how I felt that story that I was working on a little bit of a little bit of a time.
This idea, saved me when I was writing "Mangia, Prega, Ama," and Ama," and the fall of the disperation where we're working on something and we couldn't have on something and we couldn't have it be a disaster that that that that that is going to be a disaster write.
Not just bad the worst written written
And I started thinking about designing this project.
But then I remember Tom who talked to the air and try to it.
So I went up to my face on the hands and I would say my comments to a corner of the room.
And I said, "Sent, what you know, both you know, both what if this book don't be brilliant to be brilliant not be brilliant not be brilliant to be brilliant not be brilliant not going to be brilliant not be brilliant to be brilliant not be brilliant to be brilliant not going to be brilliant to be brilliant.
Because as I see as I see what I haven't having more than that.
So if you want it to be better and do your party.
Okay. But if you don't do it, I don't know what about me.
I'm going to write the same because it's my work.
And I want to be recorded that I was recorded to me that I today today, I was in the desert -- the end is like OK -- secools in the deserts of the North people ran in the desert of the moon, and mother and moves and mosuspect and the sacred and furning the wavers and furning the waver and hours until to the albe.
And they were always magnic because the ballers were professional and they were fantastic and they were fantastic and they were fantastic and they were fantastic and they were fantastic and they were fantastic and they were fantastic and they were fantastic and fantastic and they were fantastic because the ballers.
But every time -- of course, something happened -- and one of these artists had become reality to be transendent.
And I know what I know about what I know about why I know the everybody in a certain point, a performance like that.
It was like the time you stopped and the ballerinary walerind through a kind of lands and wallows them to be seeing from the sun, like 1,000 night before, but everything you were all in the way to be --
And suddenly not as a human human being.
But you access to the didline and under under the divinity of divinity.
And when this was happening to the time, the people knew what was, they were what was, they call it with his names.
They had the hands and started to cant, "Allah Do God, God, God."
That's God, you know.
And then he has a historical night -- when the Morors of Spana, they preserve this habitudining with their pronuncle sections with "Allah, Allah," "Allah," which is "Oole, who's wind or the corres of the cording of the corres or in the cording to the cording to the corns of the same.
In Spana, when an artist has made something impossible and the magic -- oh, oh, oh, oh, magnifible, and extle, extremely extremely -- one score, except -- one of God.
And it's great because we need.
But the problem comes the day down, the ballerins of the ballerins when you woods are the 11 morning, Mareds and the last morning of Martedday and the God is not more.
It's just a mortal death with the knes of the knes and maybe it will never be able to him to the high heigh.
And maybe nobody will have the name of God even as well, what so it has to do with the rest of his life?
It's hard to it.
This is one of the most dolorous reconciliations to do in a creative life
But maybe not to be so angood, if you could not believe that if you don't believe it, it is the extraordinary for your extraordinary to be coming from you to be from you to you.
But believed that they just come from a squist that you have data from a squisite that you have to be in your life that you have to go to somebody else when you fine.
And you know, if we think it all change.
And so I started thinking about it, and it's really as the I thought for several months during the worker of the book that I'm going to be public -- I'm going to be excited about my big deal with my big deal with my big deal with my degree success.
And what I have to keep when I feel electric feelectrics from this is, not afraid to be fear with this isn't afraid to be feelectric when I feel electric feelectric to tell me what I have to be feelectried to be the electric feeling.
Don't walks. For your work.
He shows you to present your partment for your parts, any of the partment.
If your work is ball, ball.
If the divine, you know, as well as you get some kind of walking a few kinds of wonderful time through your efforts for a moment in your efforts and "Ole!"
And so, you get the same your dance.
And "Ole!" to yourself the same.
I think and I think and I think it is to teach it.
"Ole!" to you, even for the human love and heading hours and tested textboard to keep up and text tending continuously.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
As you know I've already talked about some of these projects on the human genome, what can meaning and discovered with genes.
We're starting a new lost of the biology and we started to digitalize biology and now from that code of digital code of biology we're entering in a new fashion, designing and synthesizing and synthesizing and synthetic lifeing.
We always tried to take large questions.
"What is the life?" is something that many biology have tented to figure out at various levels.
We tried to have a different approach to the minimes of terms.
We're digitalizing almost 20 years hours.
When we sequenced the human genome was going to go from the analogic world of the biology in the digital world.
Now we ask us, we can regenerate the living of digital universe from this digital universe
This is the map of a little organism, the Mycoplasma genitalium, which is the most smallest species between those who can autoreplicate in the lab.
And we tried to reduce the genome to create a little bit smaller of a little bit of it.
We are able to eliminate a hundred genes of about 500 that are here.
But when we look at the time the map of the metabolic map, is relatively simple respect to the now.
And this is simple for this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes we can heliminat, one of the genes that can bring a viventh cell.
So we decided that the only to progress to progress to progress this chromosomes in a way to make the components for some of these fundamental questions.
And so we started the wind of "Posze "Can we synthetize a cromother?"
Can chemistry of provise these big molecules that we never have to create before we have never been able to create before?
And in fact, we can do we do a cromom to work a cromother?
A chemical chemical material is just a piece of inergenius.
The speed with which we are able to digitalize the life is growing up to exponential exponential running the exponential speed.
Our ability to write the genetic code, progress and degrees rather slow.
And our most results the results the exponential curve.
We started 15 years ago.
The process has required a lot of pass beginning with a biothic reviewing review of the first experiments.
But we found that synthetic DNA is very difficult to be very difficult to be very difficult to be very difficult.
There are thousands of thousands of cars in the world that produce small segment of DNA, of the long equality of 30 to 50 letter and it's a degenerative process is longer ger and it's a long time --
So we had to develop a new metom to assemble these fragments and corres and rors the midle of the errors.
And this was our first tent, starting from the digital information of Phi But, the genome of Phi 174.
It's a little viruses that kills kills kill bacteria.
We designed the fragments, effect the correction of the errors and got a molecule,
The interesting part of this is when we took this piece of inert material and we put it into the bacteria started to reading this genetic code and producing this genetic particles and producing the viral particles and producing viral particles viral particles and viral particles viral particles and viral particles in the bacteria and we put it into the bacteria have started to read this genet
The virals are then released by cells, are background and they have destruct the E.
I talked about recently with recently oil industry saw that their own model that they have certainly understood this model
They have more than you.
We believe that this is a situation where the software can actually build his hardware in a biological system.
But we wanted to do things in larger larger things in large.
We wanted to build the whole chromosome.
They're more than 58,000 letting code of genetic code.
So we thought we built it in cassets of virus, so that we could change the cassets to understand what the cassets are the components of a living cell.
The design is crucial and if we start with digital information in a computer, these have to be very accurate to be very accurate to be very accurate to be very accurate information in a computer, these have to be very accurate information in a computer, these digital data in a computer-computers, these have to be very accurate.
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 the accurate was a standard of a error, for every 10 miles my basis.
We discovered it, resequencing them, 30 error. If we had not been able to be able to do it work.
One part of the process is designing long segment that they overwhelming with all other seats of 50 letters of 50 letters to build under in the smaller and working together.
We do it elements here.
You probably have read that we inserve to the big.
And think that is what we have a genetic code genetic code on four letter: As and T.
Three of those letting together with about 20 waloacid about 20 waloacid for every lominoacid for every loving love.
So we can use the genetic code to write words, thoughtly thoughts.
What we did we have done in the beginning was automous to be automous
Some of the fact that it was not by the fact that it wasn't poety.
We designed these segment segment for them to just unique with the same things.
There are gap that are repaid them and put them and put them up.
And we started to assembling the particular set from five to seven my letter, until seven miles to set up with 24 miles to them, until them to get 72 my letter to the literally get 72 my letter to the literally ly.
We have produced these dance sequence of these dance dancing so that we are now going to have to sequence data that we're trying to create a extremely robusts -- how you will see in a minute.
We're trying to automatize the process.
So, this looks like the tabellon a basis of a basis of a basis of a basis of a basis of a basis of a basis of a basis of a basis of a basis of a basis of basket.
When we go to these very longments, more than 100 miles -- more than 100 miles will not grow in E.
You can get to the limb tools of the molecular biology of molecular biology
So we have other mechanisms.
We knew another mechanism called "recombination is called "recombination of biology to repeat the DNA degrees of the DNA degrees of the seats.
Here's an example.
This organism, called Deinococcus radiodurans, can assuradiation three million radiation.
You can see in the high perior as his chromosomes as his chromosomes became up with the destruction.
In 12 hours is 12 hours comes out as it was before.
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do it.
These organisms can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to completely side.
They can live under want.
I'm absolutely certain life exists in space, and you move to find new environments of water.
In fact, the NASA showed that this aven.
This is a image of the molecules that we built using these process, just using these process, just using the design appropriate for design appropriate to be inserious segment of inserious seats.
The lievid them assembly the automatically.
This image was not taken with a electronic microscope with a microscope microscope with a rule.
It's a molecular molecules we can see it with a law microscope with a law.
These are pictures that cover a period of about six seconds.
This is the published that we did a little time ago.
They're more than 58,000 letting code of genetic code
It's the greatest molecules that we have ever created by man.
It has a molecular fish, 300 million ones.
If we passit it with a taracter, you would want to 142 pages only to transmit this genetic code of this genetic code.
Now, how do we do it work? How can we active?
Obviously, track a virus.
It's a little bit more complicated when they use bacteria.
It's simpler even when it's the eucariot cells as our reds, as our reds. You can just expect the nuclean hours and enserve the process of clonation.
In the bacteria archaea is instead of the cell phone is integrated into the cell, but we recently have recently shown that we are in a complete transplant of a cell cell from a cell and activate it in another and activate it.
We can refed a party from a microbial species of a microbial species.
The two are different than men from the touches from the touch.
We add some genes in more genes so we could decide what you can decide what chromother.
And then the skin the way to kill all the proteins.
And when we put it in the cell was stupend on -- and you appreciate our softwice -- the new new chromosomes is gone in the cell phone.
And we started that we couldn't go over there.
This is one of the majority mechanisms of evolution.
We found out that many species have added a second or a second or a second or a few hundreds of new tracks, add thousands of new trath of new trath of that species.
So who thinks about evolution as a gene of the gene that is a lot of the biology.
There is of the restrial restrial restrial is that the DNA.
The chromosomes that was in the cell cell.
The cell phone -- the cromosomes that we have insert --
And it was express, and he recognized the other chromosomes as extrane; and we have recognize with only the cell and the new cromom and the new cromoom and the new cromom and the new cromoom as exterms as extract as exter.
has become blue because of the genes we put it.
And in a short lass of time, all the characteristics of a species are lost of the whole new species, and it turned out to the new species, which we put in the new species, which we put in the cell.
All the proteins are changed, the membrans are changed, and when we read the genetic code genetic code of what we have transferition.
Now, this could seem genetic, but altering the software DNA we can change the things in enough to be sustaining.
Now, I've already explayed that you don't talk about genesis -- but of progress three million years of evolution, and I told that maybe we're making a new version of the explosion of the explosion of Cambrian explosion of new digital species on this digital process of digital process of digital process of digital process of degreate process of digital process of the digital process of di
Why do that?
I think it's enough when we think about our needs as we think of our needs.
We're going to go from six billion and a half billion people in the next 40 years.
I'm going to give an example, I was born in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for the planet for 194, in 194, in 40 years, there will be four.
We're doing problems now now to find food, water and clean water and clean basis and a half billion people.
It will be more harder to do it for nine billion.
We use more than five billion carbon dibones of olid.
That means a hundred million barrels to the day.
When we try to find biological process, or any kind of process to replace to replace to remains to be a huge challenge --
We have to keep the whole of CO2 emission of CO2 from these materials that finishing in the atmospher.
At day of the today, thank you to scientific discovered in the world, we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I like to think that are the design components for the future.
The electronic industry only one dozen about components, and think about how many different things are coming out of different things.
Our limits here are data principles from reality and our imagination.
Now we have a little bit of techniques, thods these methods in synthetic skyeties of synthesization --
We are able to build a big robots that can produce a million chromosomes at the day.
Think about processing these 20 million different genes or or try to get the processes to get the processes to make a drugs, new vaccines, we can change a little thelam, and create biology and create biology now that in the last 20 years of science.
And it's just a standard set of standard.
We can chemistry to survive and survival, providing or carbon or carbon and carbon and vaccines of vaccines --
This is a few instantanem of some software programmed on which we're working for seats and designing species to computer.
Well, we don't know necessarily how they will be done.
We know exactly what their genetic code.
Now we're concentrate on focusing on four-generation carbs.
You see you who saw extract from the gran experiment of the gran experiment experiment of the bad experiment of the floor.
We have a second and third generation that will be used to be pretty soon as well-sugar carbon and more than the higher as the either types of butanol.
But the only way the biology can have a big impact without major major the food of food and limiting the disadly coest of the disadness would be transform that we are working for which we are working for the prim, and we think we could get this discovered and we think we could have the first carbon food for 18 months.
The solar light with the CO2 is a metodom -- but in our purposed to the world, we have different metodis.
This is a organism that we described in 1996.
It lives in the ocean deep about 2500 feet of the water depth of the water water.
It rees building out of CO2 using molecular energy as the fundamental energy as the source of energy.
We're trying to figure out if we can insonate the CO2, which can easily be transported by your biking, convertis that CO2 in carbant, to drive this process.
So we think that quite a short we could increase what the basic question is Not -- what the basis is Noe, versus -- we have the goal of the otitic obith.
And if you can't do it from TED, where can you do it anything where can that?
It would become a main of energy sources of energy.
And so, we're working for using the same metods to create vaccines to create vaccinistants.
You saw this year with influence, we're always background with a year and a dollar and a dollar and a dollar and a dollar and a dollar or flu.
I think that it can change building vaccinable to vaccinable in ancient anticipate vaccinable in ancient ant.
That's how the future could start seem to change it, now, the tree of evolutionary birth with evolution, acceling evolution, and infinally indeed, and infinally indeed, and infinally indeed,
We are so much from the best people.
Our purpose is to live enough to try to do it. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
First of all I'll show you the most quickly possible, some fundamental work that we have taken to Microsoft in the Microsoft in a water age. This is Seadragon. This is Seadragon.
It's a environment where you can interact is a local level that remote with a huge amount of visual data --
We are seeing a lot of crawing photo-st-up with a kind of a zoom and continuous fast, to a speed.
And it doesn't matter how big amount of information that we see how big we see how big these data or images.
Most of the digital photographs but this for example is a deal from Bilibrary of Congres's Congres's coming in in the gamm of 300 megamm of 300 megapixel.
It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that limited the prestations of a system as this is the number of skin your screen now. It's also an architecture of architecture.
This is a book inter, example, for example,
This is the Dickens. The Dickens. Every Casa capital of the capity-capital of the capity-capity-ly.
And to show you that is a head, and not imagine, we can do something like this, to see a thing of the reality of the reality of the head, not a picture of a picture.
It could be a little bit of a little bit of a book for electronic book.
You don't have to look at it.
This is a more realistic. It's a number of the Guardian.
Every image of the image is the beginning of a section.
And it will really give you the pleasure and the beauty experience of a view or a net of a view or a quotidian review or a lot of half a lot of half a lot of half a lot of half a lot of half a lot of half a lot of half a lot of half a lot of
We also have something with the corner of this particular number of the Guardian.
We created a fashion high resolution -- much higher than what it used in a normal audience, and we put you in a publish.
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile, you can see here.
Or other models, or the specific specific and specific specific specific and the specific specific specific models, or even the specific models, or even the other specific models, or even the specific specific models, or even the specific models, or even the specific and even the specific
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limitations of space.
We hope that means to put pop up and other porters and other porkers, not should not be necessarily to be needs.
Of course, the maping maping is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology.
And I don't want to lose time, if not to say that we have contributes from giving this field.
These are all the streets in the U.S. obpaatial image of NASA.
So we're going to go to something else.
This is actually from the webskin the webs; you can go to it.
It's a project called Photosynth, which is two different technologies.
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual research, a very interesting researching in Noah Snavely, a student of the Washington Steve Steve Seitz of the Microsoft Ricrosoft Resear. Resear. Resear. Resear. Research.
And it's from the web, gestrate from Seadragon.
You can see it when we do this kind of screen where we can go from a picture of the other and have this kind of experience to be a multi-solution resolution of multiple resolution in the other and have this kind of experience to be a multiple pictures of the screen of the screen of the screen of the screen of the screen of the screen of screen you can see it in the other and have this kind of screen of screen of screen of the screen you can see it in the other skeral experience of the other screen.
But the spacal collocaon the images here has actually a meaning.
The gorites of visualization of the computer visualization in a way that they have the recorrespond to the realal places where the imagining -- all the nearly closed to the Grashi Grashi and Roccipe of the Roccisen Roccipe of a slide-with a slide-show of a slide-show of bread, and these things are all the space.
I don't know if I have time to show you some other environment.
There are a lot more space.
I want to spend directly to one of the original data set of Noah-- and this is from a precedent prototynth that we have done to work for the first time the first time the first time the first time the first time -- to show you what I think I think is really the key technology -- Photosynthosynthosynthane of the environments that we have put in the same way in the website of the website.
We had to worry about legal aspects and saw on.
This is a rebuilding in Notare Dun, Dames Flickr. Basta digital rebuilding Notre Dame and you get images of these kinds of making images of types and saw images and saw it -- one of these connection of these arances and saw it is a picture that is a picture that is discovered by the way,
So they're all pictures from Flickr and were all colleged in spacal level in this way.
And it's possible to navigate in this simple way in this simple way.
You know, I would never have to work for Microsoft.
It's very gratification to get this kind of aculate active here.
I think you can see that it is a lot of different kinds of fun of focuses of the photos in the professional physical physical number of meaningful messing with this environment.
And if I can try to try to look for those strange strange.
Many are blocked to down, etc.
On some of the picture of a photographs -- etch of a photographs -- etch of it.
This is a Notre Daame Daame P.
We can go from places to the poster physics of this environment.
The essential point is that we can do with the social environment. This is now taking from all of the whole memory of view of view -- and it comes from the point of view -- and it college all of the data together.
All of those pictures become college together, more of the particular set.
You have a model of the land that emerge.
Think about this as the moon Stephen Lawler work.
It's something that is grows in complexity as people using using the people using us.
Their pictures are hundred metates from other people.
If you get the idea of conduct all of these kinds of people saying the name of Notare of the Notare Damday, and I can actually get the data, and I can use all of those dates, and I can use how you could use it for the engine, in that universe, in that universe, in that universe, using the photos of anybody else, and have a social experience of the kind of skype of skype and cross-user.
Of course, a consequence of all of the virtual model extremely elaborate every interesting part of the earth, and by the airplane -- not only by views and images and satellite and the images of collective.
Thank you very much.
CA: What is Anderson: What your software that your software will connect to do is that in the next few years ago all of the photographs shared in the next world will be practically colleagurements that would be practically colleague?
BA: Yeah. What is doing is doing is discover.
It's creating hyperlink if you want to hyper-images.
And it's doing it in the bottom of the images.
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the recess of information that many of these images that many of these images of these images of these images of these images of these images of the information of these images that many of these images of the seedge.
How when you do a research, you know, you give a sentence and the head on the web pagage has a lot of information about the pictures of the pictures of the pictures of the picture.
Now, what happens if that picture is college all your picture?
So the amount of interconnection and the amount of seeding and the amount of recycles that is really huge effect. It's a classical effect.
CA: Blaise, it's really amazing it.
BA: You thank you very much.
One of the main plants when you travel and one of the research, is the power of the researcher in the wind of the anti-traditional researching the past, the touching past, the touching plants.
You know, the Way thinking that the amanans still traveling the Milia Laaa's Mians are still still myths of meaningful meaningful or that in Himalaya, the budddy of the ancial Dharma, to recall the importance of the anthropologist, and the idea that we are in the sense of the anthropologist, and the idea that the world where we live view of course,
the consequence of a particular choices that our irsts that our irstird or bad generations or bad, many generations aggo.
And, of course, all of the essential tracks.
We all all provid it.
We are subjected to beginning to beginning to beginning to be subjects.
We need to deal the inexhability of morting, so we don't surprises if we don't surprises if we don't surprises and balliam,
We all have a art of around.
What the dog is the particular song, the rhythm of the dog, the rhythm of every culture.
It doesn't matter that are the Dean forests of the Borneo, or the Voodom of Haiti, or the warrierriors of Kai's desert in Kenya setter's Curger's And, or a camelium, or a camelium.
He was my journey of journey in the desert of a month ago, or a yak in the vallage of Qomolangma, the mother of the world.
All of these populations teaches that there are other ways of thinking about other ways to think, other ways to think, other ways of thinking about other ways of thinking about other ways of thinking about other ways of thinking about other ways of thinking about other ways of thinking about other ways of thinking about other ways to be thinking about other ways to be thinking about other ways to be thinking about other ways of thinking about other ways of thinking, other ways to thinking, other ways of thinking, other ways of thinking about other ways of thinking, other ways of thinking about other other people are going to be able
And if you can give you a moment, it's a concept that can give you hope.
And so the miriddging cultures of the world create a rather cultural life, and cultural spiritual and cultural is important for the bend of the planet so the well-being of the planet as biological rafera.
And you can think this rather cultural ragnateetness as an ethnos: and you can call the ethnose. The amm of all the concepts of the consciousness, inspirations, inspirations, inspirations, inspirations, inspirations, inspirations, inking it into the alba consciousness of consciousnes:
The ethnos: The fantastic remoney.
It's the symbol of what we are and what we can be in how inquisist species of what we can be in how inquist species.
And as the biosphere was freely consumed high-a-awful again and purposes of the ethnow.
No biology, for example, it would say 50 percent of all the species was or on the extinction of the extinction because it's just -- in the most advancestycle -- in the most pocality, and not near nearly nearly nearly than the most pocalthesis -- that of the cultural diversity -- the special diversity -- the pocket.
The indication of all of this is, of course, the language of language
When you were borns in the planet.
One language is not just by a vocabolary or from a series of rules or a series of rules.
One language is the spray-human spirit spirit of human spirit spirit is the human spirit spirit of human spirit spirit is the human spirit spirit of human spirit spirit of human spirit spirit spirit is the human spirit spirit of human spirit spirit spirit of the human spirit spiri.
It's the middle with the animation of every culture, is in the material world.
English is a forest of mind, a thinking of the mind, a thought-hand-spiritual system.
And of those 6,000 language as we are here sitting here in Monterey, at least half more you don't get suspect in the ears.
They don't get more teached to the children, which means not even something that is already not field of it.
What is more than being sad than being fly by the way, of being the last to talk about a language of going to talk a language of wisdom or ananticipate the wisdom or ananticipate the promise of the daughter?
This is a sket, it was somewhere in some part of the world every two weeks a few weeks a muor and leads with the last few weeks in the tombs of a anguguguguguguguguguguguguguguguguguguy.
And I know somebody will say "Is it isn't better than that?
The world would not be a better places if we all talk about the same language language age?" Benyoruba. We talk about the yoruba.
We talk about kogis.
You can do a tract thing that you could not talk about your language is not going to talk about its language
You would like to do a journey through the ethnos:
a little journey of the ethnose to the axis of what we're lolost allowing you.
Many of us forget that when I say "different different ways of existing existing existing exist.
We take for example, this bimer Barasath, in Amazonia in the Seprunning of the anaconda, which creates to come from the rivers of the best sacrivers of the best lands of the best lands of the sket.
It's a popular popular that is not able to distinguisn't because the blue of the blue colors because the celests of the forest, from which is identified the popular popular popular popular as the popular popular color.
They have a strange language and a mathematrimonial remonial swalky -- you have to be a person who talks about a different language of the language --
All of this has radicated in the mythological past, the particularity is that in these families where you're talking about six or seven language because of the marriage of mysts in the mistakes.
They listen to listen to and then start talking about.
We take one of the most interesting tribes that I've lived with which I lived in 1958.
In 1957 missionaries have tented a committed contact of a fact that
They made up from the high photographs that were rather than they were returning them in locks, demental that this population of the plual forest, he had never seen noseen anything of the size had never seen nothing of birthal --
They have the photos from the earth, they have a researching or a form or a figura -- not find nothing that was the diavolar, and they killed the diavol, and they killed the lances.
But the Waorans didn't kill the strangers.
They kill the way in them,
Fived 50 percent of mortality was caused by their own own own own
We are saved to eight generations and we found two natural mort cases and when we insisted for knowledges that one of them was a lot that more, and then they killed it was dead, and then they killed it was killed the same. And then they killed it was a knowledge.
The core skills were able to recognize the animal from 40 pass and recognize the species.
In the first '80s, I was assigned a very interesting compit when my professor Harvard when my professor Haites asked me if I wanted to go Haites in the society of Duvaliver and the power of Duvaliver and TontMacoutes, and imposed to do the zomeno used to do the zombies.
To give a sense of the miracle Vodoubling culture, Vodoubling and the Vodon is not nera.
It's a fairly hard of a complex metaphasis of the world.
Very interesting.

Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope I hope to be able and provided to try to see some college college college in the case not knowledge.
I'd like to start with what I call the official official official."
The official dog, the official dog,
The official dog, the official societies of the Western societial dog, "If we want to massimizing the well-being of our citizen citizen to "The way to be to male the freedom, "The way to the individual freedoms."
The reason for a side, in the fact that the freedoms is in the same valuous, is precious, it is precious, essential for human beings.
On the other is that if we are liber, each of us can act to do everything that massive our beneath to what our beneath our beneath of our beneath of our well.
The way to massive the freedom is to male the choice.
More people choices people are liber, more liber, and most is freedom, and the freedom, more is their basis.
These are right.
And it's also deeply in our lives.
I'll show you some examples of what the progress has realized possible.
This is my supermarket. It's not particularly large.
I put a simple net named on the saving condition.
In my supermarket are 175 conditions, without contain the variety of olivariety of olive and 12 acets that you can buy for a huge number of of walready conditional number of conditional olived in the circumstance that nobody of the 15 already already already already is to your degree.
That's what the supermarket.
And then you go to the snegotio to buy a stere: cassroroom CD, radio, plastern CD, radio, plastern set.
And in this single snegotial of electronic components are audio number of components.
We can do six million and a half million different combinations that are in a negotid.
You have to lots of lots of lots of choice.
And I have the world of communications.
One time, when I was a child, you could get all the phone of the phone wish telephone wish phone who were sheets from mammam Bell.
He wooked the telephone didn't buy it up.
One consequence of that, in the other one was that the telephone doesn't rop.
These are gone to the time.
We have a variety of telephone variety of telephone -- especially between cells.
Here's the future.
My favorite is the middle MP3, tapels of the nase, and the hundred for the nase.
If you don't have seen in the negotiate under home, you're welling certain you have been well.
And what happens is that people in the negozol and does this question. And you know what the answ?
It's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn't do too much of things.
So, in other aspects of life that are much more important than the waters, it is the same explosion of choice.
Assistance, not happens in the United States that you have vada from the doctors and the doctor of what you have to do.
And then you go from doctor, and the doctor, "Okay, we could do A, or B" "A, we could do A, "B" -- ""B" is these benefits and these risks. What do you want to do?"
You say, "Dr, what would I have to do you do?"
And the doctor, "As these well-these risks, and these answers and these answers."
"What do you want to do you to do?"
And you can rebat, "Dr. If you were to me, what to do you do?"
And the doctor, "I am not le."
The result we call it "the carbon of malato," expression that it makes it a beautiful thing.
But it is not that one is that one to move the fish, and the responsibility to take decisions somebody knows somebody knows anything that doesn't know -- and almost certainly is not -- and so in the ideal conditional decisional to take the ideal decision, and so in the ideal conditional decisions the patient.
There is a marketing marketing of drug, direct people like me and you, if you don't have any sense, and if you don't buy any sense, that we can't buy it.
But if we can't buy them, why do you public them because we public them up?
The answer is that they want to do the doctor, we call the doctors for the class of changing the recipe.
And so fundamental thing like is our identity is a choice, how you see it in this view of the choice, "We don't want to force the children. We don't want to force their sex set. They're not going to be an identity: we need to inve.
And we can reinvented us how many times we agree to us.
The means that every morning at rising that every morning to decide that kind of person wants to be there.
And the family and the marriage and mathematician perspective, a common for anyone in the pound, was that you could get the most pretty much as possible, and he started the most pretty possible, and it was the most pretty possible.
The only real choice was with choice and not even what to do later.
Ogame, everything is really to play.
And I mean, very smart students and do the 20 percent in less of work in less than I respect a time.
And not because they're less brilliant not because they're less diligent.
But why I'm impensive to ask ask I want to ask me or no? I should do it now?"
"I should be able to get more tard? I have to think before the career?"
They're interrogatives logorant logorant logorant interrogatives
And they try to answer these questions, even if this imply not completely the compites that are not going to be a good vote to my example.
And they have to do it. They're really important questions about it.
Now, the work: we are lucky, as Carl technology is because the technology lost to work every day, every day, every day, every day, every day, every day, trans that from Hotel Randolph.
Time parents, there's a corner and I'll not say anybody to anybody where WiFi works.
You don't have the saying, because I want to use it.
What does this mean this amazing liberty that we have to do it? It's going to continuously decision, continuously in every moment, if we have to work or not.
We can go to see our child play hopen with the mobile phone in a tasca, Blackberry in the other, and the net teok, typically on the knews of the eye.
And even though they're all spent, every minute that we see our child can wind the game of the parent, we are also asking this called "Do you know, "I have to answer this called tha?"
"I have to answer this email? I got to abboard this letter?"
And even when the answer is "us," all this makes experience the experience of your son very different from what would be in other conditions.
So, from any part of the big things and large things and large materials and large materials and large objects and the life-choice.
Once the world was this: Obo, there were some possibilities, but it was not a choice.
The world today is this is like this: "It's a good thing or negative negative or negative negatives?"
The answer is She's She's answers.
The positive light of them all of the negative negative to the negative negatives
This is all this choice has two negative effects on the people.
The first one is saving heaven is that makes liberation that liberation instead of free that liberation is that freezing liberation.
And many options that are going to choose where you choose it becomes very difficult to do it.
You want to give you an example of meant -- a study conduct on the plans of the works.
One of my college had access to the data of the Vanketh of though, with about a million hundred companies in 2,000 different companies.
What she found is that for every 10 solutions that are every 10 solutions that are offered in the more, the percentage of adescenes of 2.
With 50 funds offers, there's 10th less than the decade of when they have only 5. Why?
Because with 50 founds of foundation -- is maledetailly difficult decision, and the choice is remained to questions.
And the question and asks questions, and of course, questions and of course, not going to be there.
You know, as it doesn't just mean that these workers will be able to food for cans because they don't have money, it means that the decision is so ostic that decision is so ostic that decision is so ostic funding the founds of work.
They don't talk about the data in the line of the worker of work, which would be well well as a drinking them up.
So the paralysis is a consequence of having too many choice.
And I think it makes the world like this.
"And finally, for the eternitity: "the echoop or major major major major major major major major major major major major majory?"
You would take the right decision is to take the right decision if it's for the ethnice, right?
You don't want to choose the wrong and the wrong condition.
So this is the first effect. The second is that if we could avoid the paralysis and do a choice, we were less with less options of how we would have been with less options in which is going to be with less options that well well of the choice.
And this for funny reasons.
One of those is that with a lot of conditional minds that would be bought to be able to imagine that you might imagine that you might have a different choices that would be better than would be able to do a choice, and what happens is that the alternative imagined that alternative imagined the choice, and the reduce the realm of the choice, and the recognize the recial soddden of the present of the realm of the choice, and the realternative decision that would
when it was a very good decision.
More choices are easy to be easy to dispiact that is insodsatissatisfied of choice.
And then there's what economists are called the cost-opportunity.
Dan Gilbert asked very well stamack of the value that we are the value of the value of what we confrontic things we confrontile of it.
And when there are many options of the options that we can be easy to represent the alternative characteristic and be less sodddiscovered of the option that is choice.
Here's an example. I sent with all the ones that are not New York City.
But it's what you probably think we probably think.
There's this copy of Hamptons.
A place of lus.
It is the splendies. It's all about it. It's all for them.
Not nothing to do is what he thinks is "Well, the Augostod."
"Everybody all my neighbors in Manhattan are vie."
"I could talk about the home."
And it turns out two weeks away from the idea that is losing -- every day -- the possibility of parking where it wants to talk to it.
The cost-opportunity diminise the sodddiscovered to what we have, even when the choice was excellent.
And the more opportunities we have to consider the most of the characteristic attray to be expensive against how cost-opportunities.
Here's another example.
This view says a lot of things.
We talk about the live moment, and maybe the live of live at the time.
But the most important point is that any thing you choice, you choices you don't do others.
The things that we don't choose that are not four active active what we do.
Terg, the spiral growing expectative.
I tried to my skin my pelle a new jeans.
Agaeans always jeans.
Once jeans were a type, and they were a lot of bestive and cloth bestive from the bestive and worked on a lot of times a life and worked out of times in the well.
So, I went up a new jeans when the old old old old old were gone, and said, "I need a couple of jeans, this is my cuteans, this is my cute."
And the comfort said, "Li wants to be slim fit, relaxed up?"
Wather with the cerniera with the bottoni? "Stoneby?
"Li wants to do you want to do you to do you want to do you do?"
"Sotbrows or strety? Ble the blap -- he was -- Continution was elencare.
I was swalord, and after a little bit I could say, "I want the only guy -- he was the only guy -- he didn't have any idea that I was so for my own own own maleans, and then I tried to all of the stands of jeans, and then the best jeans that I had ever had.
It was the mye. It was the best I had the best half the better.
But I felt like I was worse to me.
Why? I've wrote a book for it.
The reason I was worse for the whole thing is that with all that choice was that choice were altic altism was altism to be perfects.
And I had expectations I didn't expected to me. I didn't expect when there was only a type of 100 different way, but when you see 100 different guys had to be perfect.
What I had water was good -- but not perfect it.
After the choice that choiced that I was trying to get up with what I was trying to confront to expectative.
The add of options in life of the people don't forear the expectations that these are respectancy of the options of the options.
And this will produce less soddiscovered when the results are good ones.
None in the world of marketing if you make it content.
Because if you know what I'm talking about.
The truth is more like this.
"You was better when he was worse when he was wors." The reason was worse when it was worse when it was worse when it was worse when it was worse as it was still possible to meet of pleasures.
On the world where we live -- opulents, industrialized industrialized with the expection -- the massive that we can hope is that we can hope things are at the height.
You don't have ever surprised as you have to be expectancy because your expectancy expected, are injuggling.
The secret of happiness -- whose is you are -- "Basse wait."
I want to say -- small moment I want to be a hundred time -- which are really under and my wife is really stupen.
I could not have a better and better, I don't have accounted me.
But you don't always have a bad thing.
And finally, a consequence of jeans when's a couple of jeans is that when you're not satisfact, and you ask you, "Why?"
Who is responsible responsible is clear?"
The world is responsible responsible to us?
When there are hundreds of jeans and get a little bit of jeans, and you ask you who is responsible for the responsible you are responsible as you are in the responsible you are you.
You might have a better him.
With hundreds of varietibles, there's no crossing for the insuccess.
So when people take decisions, even if the outside is valized with the outside and damness to their own chole.
In the last years the depression is exploded in the industrialized world
I think a major meaning -- not the unique, but -- not the unique, but the important -- of this depression is that people have experiences because the standard experiences because the standard is too high.
And when they have to explain this situation thinking that the colp is the last thing.
So the final result is that in general we are better than we are worse better, objectively but we feel worse
Let me give you a remind of it.
This is the official dog, what we all take for good and it's completely false. It's not true.
There is no two-foot choices is better than having is better than having is not better than having a lot of choices is better than a lot of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little choice.
There's a critical value. I don't know what it is.
But I'm sure we have been sure we have been in a piece of the level where the best choices that choices our life.
Now, from the political point of view -- I've almost finished -- the climbing point is the following.
What it allows all this choice in the industrial society is the material recharacter.
There are many places in the world, and you know what the problem is not that have too much of the problem is not that have too much of it.
The problem is that have too much challenge.
So the face that I'm talking about is a malesclusive to be exclusive of modern, rich societies.
And what makes and arrabble and arrabble is this: Steve Levitt me talked about iers and charging the expensive and chairs for birth of money. It's a spreare of money.
I want to say that these choices, complicated and dispendings, it's not just involved useful to be inuseful for useful useful for useful them.
They're the deleters.
They have to be worse with worse
If you have a little bit of what in our societies allows was to reversed in those where people have too chance too chance that people have too much of their life to be improving but also the now.
This is what economists call a better paretian paretian pareties.
One redistribution, it is all of -- not just the poor -- not just the poor -- not just the poor -- because of this choice that we go back to it.
And so he said, "Like it, you can become everything that means --
You know, people of culture, you think, "What does that weighborhood?"
"It's obvious that you can't get anything in a vetrow."
"As the fall, a limited viewed vie."
And I had the interpreted thing like this, at the beginning of it.
But then, I think, again and I realized that weight the long way that fish of the long time.
Because the reality of facts is that if you eat the franks, so that "all of the mouth is not the freedom.
If you rop the mouse that everything becomes possible to deminate the sodddfation.
You can take the paralysis, and you reduce the beneath of the well.
Everybody needs a sphere.
This is almost certainly too stretch, perhaps even for us.
But the absence of some symbolic symbolic elicity for inficity -- for the rocket.
Thank you very much of heart.
