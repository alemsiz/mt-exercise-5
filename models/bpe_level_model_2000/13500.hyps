The year I showed these positive demonstrate that the hot calculate that the type of the artical 48 million years has had the size of 48 States of the 40.
And this underneath the gravity of the problem because it doesn't show it not show the beautiful spex.
The art glacial climate is, in a sense, the heart climate the climate climate system.
You expands of inver, and you get right.
The next next to be a remarkable careful carefueled on the last 25 years.

As you see, they expanding up to the blue blue there.
That's the ice in the winver, which is the wind of exted.
You can see that the ice ice ice ice ice ice ice ice ice ice ice ice five years or more, is like the blood -- is like the blood from the body.
In 25 years of this is been pasting from this, at this.
This is a problem because the interested in the earth, the earth, the earth, where there are enormous where there are enormous amount of carbon and congeled that they are coming from the microbe.
The total-to-climbed totality from the global atmospheric to the global pollution could ran that we could ran to be writer of not ritor.
In some laghi laghs the foundation in Alaska rebooking from water.
The professored Katey Walter of the University of Alaska is rected with a team pressed a basic lago in versus of the walk.
Video: Wow! Al Gore: He's the question is if we will even even now.
A motivating is that this environment to the growth of the north Groenland.
This is a glacial regime
The levels never reached the similar levels
This is the Kangerlusuawful of the Groenland.
If you want to know how to do the sal level of the gap of the gap of the gap of the level.
These are increasing increasing involved in the cords.

This is a gap of the instening of the instant.
If you look at the context of the story can see the consequence.
We have the last five years we added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the ocean every day.
Look at the American area of Pacific Pacific area of poveriment in the west, and on the subject parts of the well where there is a very poor in the oceans.
The greater of global warming deforestation, together to deforestation, which is 20, is the usual usual combined them.
The oil is a problem, and the carbon is perset is even even even worst
The United States are one of the more with more emissions, together with Cina.
And it proposed to build a lot of other carbon to build a carbon to build a carbon to build a carbon to build a carbon to build a lot of other carbs.
But we're assisting a change or direction.
These are the projects of annulled in the last few years and some of the green revers.
At every way, there's a political loty in our Paese.
The carbon and the oil industries have 250 million dollars in the last year year for the last year for the last year for the last year -- which is a more.
And this image me a remind of something --
Nato, in the Tenness, where we live a lossing of 3.8 billion landscape of carbon of carbon of carbon of carbon of carbon of carbon of carbon in the Tennesessee, where we live a lossh of carbon of the carbon of the literers of the car
Maybe you have seen it sounds to me.
This is the second largest flew of scores in America.
It's happened around Natal.
The natalized natalia of carbon of the carbon was this thing.
Video: I was a lot of the carbona's a kind of happiness.
It's a source here in America, and making our economy.
Frosty the carbon is more clean more clean more clear clear clean.
It's a good price, and the workers and the workers and they keep the same hands are the stick.
Al Gore: Does here is a lot of the West Virginia.
The largest society minerary society is Massey Coal. This is Massey Coal.
Video: Don Blands: Sarcharck -- Al Gore, Nancy Pelogo, Harry Reid -- they don't know what they're talking about.
Al Gore: So the Proteon the Proteon the Clim has a two campaign of the country.
This is a essentially a of it.
Video: At COALer's see the climate change as a miniset as a minm of the business.
So our priority is to invest a great amount of money in a bunch of money to make the public and confluses the real balloons.
In fact, the carbon is not spor.
We think it's a good -- it is a good properties.
So not pretty exactly climate change climate change
Let me do now.
Video: Atore: Carbong, you heard about a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of the lot.
So let's do a game in a folding in a framework for the carbon the carbon the clean awful carbon the clean awful food.
Straordinary carbon! I am a little rumore, but this is the sound of the carbon the clean a-clean aware of the carb.
The consumer is between the global principle of the global rescales of global charge, but the energy of the carbon that you see change.
To look at a clean oddy technology of the carbon the carbon the carbon the carbon
Al Gore: Infine, the alternative positive to the economic question, and the national security and that security and that security and the national security of the national security of the national security of the national security and the national security and the nation.
Video: Man: The American is crisi; the economy, the national security climate climate climate climate climate climate climate climate in the national climate climate and climate climate climate in the national climate climate and
The film that the film that colleges all of the connect from the combinable comboned in the carbon and the oil care and the important.
Now, there's a new new audition to usual usual solution to us.
We have America: 100-clean energy clean for the years.
A plan to put the American work, making us to work with the global resecurity and help the global scales.
And inally, a solution that you can solve our problems.
We have America. Scopy of it.
Al Gore: This is the ultim.
Video: They're treatment to America.
One of the fastest mostly hard to dependence from the beautiful dependence from our planet.
He talked about. Here is here. I mean, a new result of energy --
She talks about 2: Novi investments for places of the wells of well.
Man: Reption, it's time to be realists.
Al Gore: A old old a we'll say, "If you want to go to the sun, you go to the money.
If you want to go away, and they go to this."
We have to go to the top of the fast.
Thank you very much.
The year last year at TED fect the LHC.
And they promise to reach you how the machine.
So I go. And for those one one once of the other time there is no ergest experiment in the scientific experiment that I never have a methick of circumstop of circumstom.
And the begin is to receive the conditions that were less than a billion second from the universe -- until the beginning of the universe -- until of the second.
And all is simply of it.
This is the Gineva.
We have these mini-Big Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Big Bang Big Big Big Big Big Bang Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Wig Big Big Big Bang Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Wig Big Big Big Big Big Wig Big Big Big Big Wig Big Big Big Big Big Big Wig Big
This is what I work. It's called TLAS -- is largely 44 feet and has a 2-feet of 2meters and has a 22 feet of two feet and a 2-feet of the four feet of the four feet
This is a space, a spectacular image of ATLAS in building proportions.
The 10 sweet of the scored year we accesor the first time.
And this picture was taken from ATLAS.
It was because of the immenses in the control.
It's a picture of the first phone of particles that had all done all of the LHC, running in collision, deliberated, with a part of the LHC, and difficult particles in the level.
In other words, when we see that the 10 set, we seem the 10 set, we understand that the machine, which is a great life.
I don't know if it was to do us more opening to do that, when someone went to Google and lives that the pay was this thing.
And that means we had a cultural impact of the scientific impact to what scientific impact.
About a week docts, there was a problem with the machine, I had to these films here -- these files.
These films are 13,000 printing when the machines the powerful machine.
Now, the technical technical and say, "They're not true. They're not true. They're too much undernews."
And they can do it because when I am very quickly become the surprised files in the surprising surprising files.
So at less 271 degradies, to a inferior to that space, these files can bring that corrup.
In one of the most of the most novels between the MHC, there was a fabrication.
So the files are surprising read and 13,000 printing 13,000 printing suddenly meet a electric.
This was the resulted.
Now, this is more impressionate if you think these magnets are more than 20 tons of 20 tons of about 30 centimeters.
They are damamed about 50 magnet.
We had to lot, what we had to do it.
We have repristined and added added and add justed it.
They're writing all of their below underneath the grounth.
And the end of the sea landscape of the LHC will be new integrated again.
We're access to get the universe. And we expect the data or him, and continue to keep out that we can get the wind to discover what are the matter inspired the universe.
Now, of course, in a certain the way, these drive clear patterns on the science and the engineering science and engineering to conversation.
I think the fact that it's so hard to go over the limits, I think it's the value of the limits, I think it's the value.
I want to conclude with a scientisted scientisted Inglese, Humphrey Davy, which imagine, in difesthe, and the experiments of his hot was Michael Farad, and he said, "No much dangerous, you know, "No much dangerous is so dangerous, which is not a lot of the human beings that are in nature that we are not a very write that we are in nature that we were not all about our own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own triggeronewalonglanderad,
Thank you.
I want to start asking you to rethink about what I would play to thise, I play with the bad butters --
And as you realized them and realized them and to make them and moving them and moving them and resolving them and solving problems and solving problems and eat relationship and relationship.
The spacal reasoning is propertive is deeply to understand part of the world around us.
So by the charge ispirated by our interaction with physical objects, together to my consult and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanith, I started asked to ask my hands, I started asking a computer, and if we use a computers, and then we use a computer-digital degreital with a handscape of the pasteasy that you to be a deal with a charge information with ent, and so I could actually get a realized information with a handless,
and we are going to our please?
The question was so interesting that I decided we decided to explore the answers, building Siftable.
In a few words, a Siftable computer is a big computer interactive as a big.
In a few words, a Siftable computer is a big computer interactive as a big.
You can move with the hands, they can see sit between them, and they feel the motion and they have a wireless.
But about, are physical objects, as the mattones, you can move to be able to be able to be able to be able to realized to be able to realize.
The Siftable example of a new ecosystem of a new ecosystem for demanipulate information.
And as they become more physical and consciousness, and as well as well as they become more physical motion, and as they are consciousness, of the other type of the interaction.
I'm going to start with some simple example.
This is configurated to show video -- if you inct the video -- if you including video game, if you inct the other other back.
These interactive ritual are consciouss.
If they are interesting them in what they are in what they mean they were going to be around it.
If they are surround and they can agitate a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of it.
If they are surround and they can agitate a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of it.
They also also also their movement and inclination.
We realized that one of the interesting interaction was the power to use gestern communities in the data, in the data as a liquires like a liquid.
In this case, we have three Siftable configured as seckets and I can use them for the color, where they missing them in the central where they missing them in the central central where they missing them in the central central midle of the colors of the color.
and I can use them for the color, where they missing them in the central centry, where they missing them in the centry, where they missing them in the centry, where they missing them in the centry, where they missing them in the central centry, where they missing them in the central central color.
If we have too much of that, we can put a little bit of place.
They are also possibly possibly possibly to learning, the mathematics and games where people can try and seeing things that people can try and see the speed things that are results and seeing the results of immediated.
Now I'm --
This is a Fibonaction of Fibonacus that I do with a equations.
Here we have a game of words that is in the Scarabee and Boggle.
Sietimes a land-half a land-house on every turns to every turn in every turns a land-house on every turns out of Siftable, and while you can compose the control of the control on a dition.
And then after about 30 seconds remissing a new set of lects, and you can try and new possibility to try and make new chance to try to try to try and make new charge of them.
Thank you.
Here's the children came in the Middle Lab, I did in the Lab, I did and I gave them a video.
They are pleased a lot of it.
And one of the interesting things that kind of apply is that you don't have to give you a lot of instruments.
You just say, "Well the words, and they will exactly what to do.
Here's some people who try it.
This is our best textremely head of young people.
And it was just implant.
They just were only morning to him.
Now, this is an apply of a interactive cards.
We wanted to build a tool for the English languages is Felix.
It can inserve new personal personal ages in the scene, and they were spoke Siftable to their associats.
It can inserve new personal personal ages in the scene, and they were spoke Siftable to their associats.
So it's doing using the sunning of the solid.
Video: The sole is surprising.
David Merrill: On a hot in the scene.
Video: The treator --
Bel work! Si! Si!
So I get the Siftable and put the close and put people in the people --
Video: Bau!
--
Video: Cao!
DM: It's a story with open-infinal story with the open.
DM: It's a story with open-infinal story with the open.
Video: Volole, I gain it.
DM: The last example, I have the time to show you is a tool, to field and expensive and expensive music.
it's a instrument, recently, to field and exeply and exequal music.
The Siftable here are in the soul, and batteria.
Every one of these has four different variations, and you can choice that we can choose which we use to use it.
And then then incourage these sounds in a sequence from the sequence to your food or to your food or or or pattern.
And to modified it simply to touch a sounds and a sequence.
These are effects that you can control from living, as the reverse and the filter.
And they attack a particular sounds to add and then including it.
And then there are the general effects like time and volume, which is they apply to interest sequence.
Let's look at how it works.
Video: We start to put a basit in two Siftable sequence, the system, we can put the system, the extend to be a series, and extensive other base.
Now on a basic line.
Video: DM: Once the top of the ussion --
Video: DM: And I'm going to put the movie to the bacteria, so I can control the effect from live it.
Video: DM: Post speed the whole sequence of the time from a time from the time from one to the other.
Video: DM: And now I'm going to add the movie to give more expression.
Video: DM: Post the sequence of the sequence to the sequence to the sequence.
So I don't have to planning the earlier, but I can try and make more than to try or more than I can provising a more corta.
And now, finally, I can even get the whole sequence to fix the sequence in the left Siftable "Siftable to the Siftable "Sifttable to the whole sequence.
Thank you.
So as you can see, my passion is build new interfaces that are more more more than our brain works, and more more more than our brain and body.
And today, I had time to show you one of the results of this percorn, and some possibly possibly that we try to bring out of the lab.
The concept I want to transmit is that we want to transmit with the media designed objects to interact with the media digital media in our world that we want to do in our world that we want to do.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the time of speaking with all of you.
They're a write write.
Scare about the books is my professional but it's more of this -- of course.
It's also the love and the fashine of my life.
And I don't expect I can't change it.
But I said, something that was happened in my life, and I meat my life, and my careera, which has taken me to realibring the whole whole recently with this work.
The thing I particular is that I recently written this book, this biography called Mangia, Ama" -- and Ama" the different previous previous thing, for some reason -- and I become a big sensition of the world and become a big sensition of interaction.
And the result is that everyone from now, people are like they were condent to me as they were condent to me.
It is true -- condence, condence.
They are now all worried and I said, "You don't have purpose to the purpose of you can't do more, "I don't have a better?
You don't have to pay to continue to write all life without any of life could be able to create a book, which can be able to someone who can you do someone who can you do someone under to be able to write someone who can you can actually do someone who can you can actually get someone who can you write to write a book,
that can be important to someone who can you do that?"
It's running to be absolutely aware of it.
But it may go to worst the worst I remember that I remember 20 years ago, when I started to say people -- I was a adolescent -- I wanted to be a writic.
I met against the same reaction of the same reaction.
And people saying, "I don't have any time I don't have success?
You don't have purpose that the upon birth of kills killed to you?
You don't have to do this mestyself for all life without any life that you never come out and became out and origins on a heart of square with the shop of love flips with the shop flight?"
So you know that.
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is, "Si."
I have a purpose of all these things.
I always had a purposed.
And I also have purpose of many other things that people could not inhim.
As the algain and other things often --
But as I realized to write what I thought and I wonder to be a ultimely because it is?
Is it is rational it?
And it's logical that anyone debes to be often to be sent from a job that you feel that you feel to do.
But what is so particular in the impreseset to make us nervous about the mind of the mind of the mindsave that other carry don't fan?
How do my father, for example, he was a nice and I don't remember one time in its 40 years of the activity that was asked to be extremely engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineing to be engineing to be engineing to be engineing for the suntil that was a suntil that the skyay to be able to be the engineer in the her where the
It was never -- that I was that block John, how well you wish John, as well as well as well as wouldn't John,
It didn't work, it was going to work in it.
Enestly, the engineers as group as group as group as wing several reputation of being alcolized to be alcolized in the reputation of being reputation in the reputation of being reputation in the set of the reputation to be alcockets as walked up with the reputation of being alcolized in the several set of being alcocknest.
We have written this reputation, and not only writers but creative writers but creative creative of any generates of being enormously instable.
And it's not rest that look at the tristes of the mortons of the diseases that creative creating that, only in the wind century, they have young young young people and often for them.
And the people who don't have been in the sounds like they were actually disappeared by their women.
Norman Mailer, before I was the first of the interview said, "Ogny my book me a little bit more than a little bit more than a point of the remajor -- the remarkable to work in the work of their life.
But we don't have a lot of the way we heard about because we heard these things that we were completely interiors that we completely interiors and accepted the notion and the soft that the creativity and the suffering that art, the art of the angoes to the up, and the art of the angoes.
And the question I want to take all to all of the today is, you know, I do with this ideas?
It goes this thing -- because it also looks at one centimeter of the distance of me is not good for anything that supposed to be nothing for anything that supposion.
I think it's gooding.
And I think it's dangerous, and I don't want to see the perpetuate in the next century.
I think it's better to incord our big minds creative minds creative creative to live.
And I know that in my case -- in my housing, it would be very dangerous, I would start out to feel that I felt the circumstances that are in my careers.
Of course, I look at that, I was a young, I have about 40 years.
I still have about four decade working in me.
And it's very likely that any thing write I write in the world as I write from the world as work that I often after I often the world as I often before my book.
I'm going to be slave, because we are all or friends here -- it's probably the mind of my greatest friends.
Oh, Gese, which I think of hero!
You know this is the kind of thinking that bring a person begin to start to start to broke, and I don't want to do it.
I would continue to do this work that we do do this work that we do.
So the question becomes become to become it?
And so I seeds after a reflect reflect that the way to continue to continue a psychological psychological cooks?
I have to find a fourth of security between me, I am write I write and my natural reaction that I write the reaction of the time to get E, trying to get the next year to look through the time, trying to look through the time, trying to look through the time, trying to look through the time, trying to see if they could have ideas and see if they could have ideas and more.
how to help people creative to do people creative inherents emotional inherent inherent.
And that research has taken to the Greet, Roma.
Seguits because it was in certain and then back.
In the ancient Grecia and Rome -- people don't seem to believe that creativity came to believe that creativity came from human beings from the "World World World World World World World Well people don't think of the human beings that creativity creative coming out of the human beings of the ""Does people don't think creativity to believe that creativity creativity being being being done from the human beings of the """""""""The people people who don't belibeli
It was thinking that creativity was this spirit is about divine and sevenies from a few distant distant and seven, for reasons and unconsequence.
The gregregreats called these inspirits of creativity "demoniors of creativity "demoni."
Socrate, wonderful credemon to have a demon that elate sands from the longer sand.
The Romans were the same idea, but they call that kind of spirit without a genie.
The big thing is that the Romans were not thinking a genius was someone particularly intelligent was someone else.
They believe that a genius was this kind of divince that you believe in the walls of the study of a artist, a little bit like the elpho Dobby, and that came out of the nassister of the arrange and modeling the result of the result of that work.
And that is the care -- this is the distance of the psychological psychological psychological that protect you protect the results of your work.
And they knew that was so that it working, right?
So the artists were protypes were protected, as for example, or now, now?
If your work was exceptional was not to take all the market, all of the market, all of the market, all of the same incorporate that incorporate or this incorporate incorporate it.
If your work is not a couple of your work, it was not care of your just?
They knew that was your genius that was your genius.
And so people concept the creativity in Occycle for a very time.
Then the Rinascient Rincome and changed this big idea; we put the human being; we put the human beings and all the midle of the universe and no longer and no longer to creatures and without the divinity.
This was the raational principle, and the raational and people started thinking that creativity was going to think creativity from ished.
And for the first time in the story, you coming to this artist is like a piuttook a piuttoday as a piuttoday with a person with genie.
And I have to tell you was a big error.
I think allowing someone who allowed to believe to be like a recipient as a recipient as the bottom and the surprising of all my own beings, creativity, inconsciousness and the lots of the human beings and spot to be a filter, and you can find that human beings.
It's like to ask someone of engineer the solid
And it was a completely and history and creates all these ingestible expectancy on performance.
And I think it was this pressure to availed the artists in the past.
And if this is true, and I think that the question becomes and now?
Can we do it different?
Magary to a more antics of human relationship between human relationship between human and creatiss.
Or maybe no.
Maybe we can't cancelling 500 years of raational thinking about a raational talks about a 18 minutes.
And there is probably people between the audience that solled to suspects of scientific nar-in-nation insects that they follow people who are going to follow their projects.
I won't convinced you all about this thing.
But the question I would like to take is -- why we are that?
Why don't think about the modo?
Because it has more sense of any thing that I ever heard to explaining the explain experant process of creative process of creative process of creative process of creative process of creatic process of the creative process of the creative process.
A process that I ever have a process that I ever have tented to do something -- and so fundamentally in the sket.
And in fact, it can seeming a completely paranormal seem to be completely paranormal seem to seem to seem to be completely paranorm.
I did this met against the extraordinary extraordinary of the same Ruth Stones that has 90 years, but it was a poet, and I said that during his childhood, and I felt the walken out of the walking, and I would hear the walks, and I heard the walked from the countrue.
He said it was like a reragorous tren.
And that was reaching to the landscape.
It was to get to get to get the earth of the earth in the earth in the midddle of its feed.
It was to have a solar thing to do to do that and it was did, and he said, "corrup, and they said, "corrup."
And so it goes to home and it was inseques from this poethesia, and it would have to make another one piece of paper and a nice wild and a fastonishing the past, and the past, and I read the page and the pattern.
And you couldn't have to be able to be enough fastonished and correes and recorres and the recorres and the poethesian and the poet, and she would continued through the land and and it would continued to roten through the landscape and and it would continued to the countrue, and he said, "another poeta."
Then there were those times -- this piece of -- this piece of the time that was almost perdent moments that was almost perdending, ok?
So he was running at home and he was looking for the carry and the poeth, and the poet, and he was going to go and then he was going to go and then he was going to go and the off. And then he was like the other hand and the off.
He offed the poem and the poem from the co-hand the reputed the pay was the paying pattern.
And in these casts, the poetry would be on the perfect and intintact around the last word to the earlier.
So when I felt the thinks -- it's exactly the waste of the creative process of my creative process.
I don't have a creative process -- I'm not a conditive condute.
I'm a muly, and my way to work and I can see it is, I see it in the same orary every day and work and work and work and go to the right and go to the right him.
But even in my head in my head, I realized against the thing,
And I image many of you have a han done of you have a han done in fact.
You know, if the work and ideas and ideas and ideas I could not be able to be able to saying.
And what this is that?
And how can we relate to do you don't have to lose the textent the textent that we do to remains you can get you feed?
So I reduce the best example of the example I have the Mush Waits, which I interview in the name of a day.
We were talking about that, and you know, Tom, and you know, Tom, the major of life was the incarnation of the artist of the charge, looking for control of charge, to control these species of creatives to creative these species of creative creatives to the inner of the inner creative of the life of life creative lifestyestors.
But then instead of that, and a day was driving on the under hyping the carry of the authrowing of the him.
He was going to go and fast a tract of the lodia, which is that you get in his head as the inspiration, elusive and you want to get and you know, and you want to get it. You know, it's wonderful and you know, it's won't how to take it.
It doesn't have a piece of paper -- not a mathemat, it doesn't have a record.
So I started to feel this kind of old old old this kind of old old in the type of per, and I remarrying hossessionate with this song perseeds.
I don't have enough good enough and I can't do it."
And instead of go to the basic panic stop it.
I'm going to be the whole process and he did something completely new it.
And he looked at the skely's and said, "Scus, I don't see that I'm driving that I'm driving to the sky?"
"You seems that can write a canzone dog?
If you really want to exist, I was going to take a more opportunity when I can take me current to you.
Or you have to important someone else to the today.
You go to disturbing Leonard Cohen."
And his process working changed after that.
Not work, the work was still as you seeding as you seeds.
But the process, and the fishing thing that was released when the genius, the genius, the genius, the genius, which was that he was nothing that I would have to be a remaking and it was going to be a whole thing that I had to be a whole thing that I had to be a whole thing and I return back and back back back and back back and back back back and backward-hood processet and the gather.
But I welling this piece of peculiaring a conversation between Tom and this thing that allowed to Tom and extremely not Tom. And I was not Tom.
So I felt that story to change a little bit bit the way I was working and already already a time.
This idea, I save me when I was writing "Mangia, Ama," and he foot in one of those care of the disperation where we all have when we all working on something and we could start thinking that a dest, and I could start thinking that is going to be a disaster, which is the worst of the worst book.
Not only good at the peggame, the book.
And I started thinking about this project I started to think about this project.
But then I remember the Tom who worked at the air, and try and try and try and tries.
So I spoke my face in the handscape and I direct my face in the room.
And I said, "You know, I mean, "Yes, I mean, what this book is not not going to be brilliant not going to be brilliant not going to be a path -- right?
Because as I see I'm going to put all of us all that I don't have any longer than that.
So if you want to think it's better and you have to press and do your parts.
Okay, you know, you don't know what I don't mean you know about it.
I'm going to write the same because it's my work.
And I would like to do that was recorded that I today I today I represented to my theles" because it -- at the end is there," because of the people who were in the deserts for the dances of the Africa, the people who were going to be able for the dances that were going to go and hours and the walbe.
And they were always magnific because the balers, and they were fantastic.
But every tas, something happened happen, and one of these artists becomes in reality,
And I know what I talk about it, because I know that you all over a point, a certain point, a performance of it.
It was like the time you stop and the walker walking through a kind of bring and not was doing nothing that was doing nothing from the solit, as 1,000 night, but all of the solid -- but all of it all ineava.
And of suddenly not just as a human human being.
But you access from the begin and below from the beautiful den the divinity.
And when this happened to them, I knew what I was called the name of what I was called her now.
They were going to cycked the hands and they started cant, "Ah.Allah, God, God, God,
That's God, you know.
He saw the non-historical non-history -- I preserve the Spay that they were going to be in the several ses and the crazy changed in the set of "Okay, "Oole, you can feel in the fle-walking in the fleet in the fle-float.
In Spaper, when a artist has something impossible and the magic -- and yh, well ell as well, magnic, and they pick it -- a charge -- a score, and a score, and a choice of God.
And it's big because we have need.
But the problem goes the day doctor, for the baller, when you ske, and I discovered that I spoke and the 11 of the morning of Martedy -- and I spoke up and the last few of Dod is no more.
It's just a mortal with a dead with the glandscape of the game, and maybe you never can see that almost the higher to that alth.
And perhaps no chantery the name of Dod even as well, and what does it have to do with his life?
It's hard to be very hard to be very hard to be very difficult.
This is one of the most dolorous dolorous dolorous dolorious recycle recket.
But perhaps not to be so ancient to be so done if you can not believe that the most expects of your being coming from you are being being being being being coming from you come from you to you,
But I believe that they are data to you come from a prestore of this squist of the squisite that you have to go to someone when you go to someone when you go to someone when you go to someone when you finished.
And, you know, if we think about this whole whole change.
And so I started thinking about it, and it's sure as I thought about several months during the working about the book that public book that public book that public book -- the dangerous, the dangerous morning, attention to my big deal with my big deal with my big deal with my big deal with my big book.
And what I have to continue when I feel I feel feel elected from this is, I don't have to paint it.
I don't just argues. It just your work.
Continues for your parts, which is that you can be able to be it.
If your work is ball, ball, ball.
If the divine, assurgery to leave some kind of wonderful to leleave some kind of wonderful time through your shape, "Ole!"
Or you have the same tumer your dance.
And "Ole!" to you, you know,
I think and I think you have to teach it.
"Ole!" to you, even for you, just for the human love and head and head and head to represent continuously to present.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
As you know I talked about some of these projects on human genome of the human genome of new set of genes.
We're starting a new new sound: we started to degitalizing biology and now to that code the biology and now now in a new fashion, and designing and synthesizing lives.
We always seeing to take a big questions.
"What is something that is that many biological biological biological have been taking to figure out to understand various levels.
We have a different approaches, reduced the minimi minimes in terms.
We are digitalizing almost 20 years now.
When we sequenced the human genome was going to go from the analotic world of biology to the world digital world.
Now we asked us to regenerate the life, or creating new life from this universe to digit?
This is the map of a little organism, the Mycoplasma genome of the genome of the smallest between those who can autoreplasma of those who can autoreplasma of those who can autorem to get to the labab.
And we tried to reduce the genome of the genome to create a little bit more smaller than that.
We are able to eliminate a hundred of genes of the about 500 that are here.
But when we look at a metabolic maps to metabolic map.
And this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes we can elimine, one to the time, it's very improbably that this can bring to a live.
So we decided that the only way to progrese was synthetic to progress to make this cromodified to make the components for some of these questions.
And so we started the wurning of the "Possetic cromother?"
It can make chemical chemical consumer these big molecules that we never ever can create before we have never been able to create before you have never been able to create before you do before you can never make this big chemice.
And, in case of them, we can make a cromoso-making cromother?
A cromosomes is simply a chemical piece of chemical material in the inerting.
The speed that we are able to digitalize the life is growing life is growing exploiting exploity-growing exploitalizing the exploitalizing life exploitalizing life exploitalizing life is growing the exploitalive the life is growing to degityalive
Our capacity to write the genetic code of the genetic discovered patterns of course, but it's better than that.
And our most recents recents the door recently recently recently recently
We have been more than 15 years ago.
The process has requires a lot of past, starting with a biothic revision before the early experiments.
But we found that synthetic sintetic spoke is very difficult.
There are decade of thousands of the world that they produce small segments of DNA, the long ethrow and it's a degenerative process and it's a degenerative process of it.
So we had to develop a new metom to assembling these fragments and correct the error.
And this was our first tentative information from the digital information of the genome of the Phi X 174.
It's a little virus that kills killed food.
We designed the framments, effect the correction of the errors and kept a lot of of the errors of about 5,000 letter.
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemical material and we insert it in the batters, the batters have began to read this genetic code and produce the particles of virals.
The particles are virals are then relet from cellules, are back to the cellules, and they distroken Ecools.
I talked about recent with members of the oil industry was saying they certainly compreprecise this model.
They have more than you.
We think this is a situation where the software can actually build the same hardware in a biological system.
But we wanted to do things more in big things in big things.
We wanted to build the whole cromosome.
They're more than 580 mildle code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of the genetic code of genetic code of coded.
So we thought of building this in cassets of the virus, so that we could change the cassets to understand what the cassets are components of a lives.
The designation is crucial information and if we start with information in a computers, these have to be very accurate to be very accurate to be very accurate to be very accurate information in a computers.
When sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 the accurates was a standard of a error,
We found out of that, 30 error. If we were used that sequence. If we were used that sequence. And we never have been able to do it work.
A part of the process is to designing several ses that you feel that you feel to make all of the other segments of 50 lects of 50 lects to build underneath unity and working together.
We can elements a until here.
You probably read we read the physical board
Think of the thing: we have a genetic code on four letter: AC, C, GG.
Three of those lects together with about 20 amminoacid about 20 amminoacid of lecectly remind of the load.
So we can use the genetic code for write words, frather thought,
What we did at the beginning was autiful to the beginning was autiful to the beginning was augment.
Some are states from the fact that it was not poeth.
We designed these segments for simply to simply in the same time.
There are improving them and they repet them and put them and put them and put them and put them and put them and put them and put them and put them and put them and put them and put them and put them and put them and put them and put them and put them and put them and put them and put them and put them and them and them out them.
And we started to assembling the particular set of the militerally, the militerally, until seven mildle of 24 mildle lesight to their until to get 72 to get 72 the land.
We have produced these segments in the abundance in the abundance so that we're going to sequence, we're trying to create a procept of creating a tremely robute.
We're trying to automatizing the process.
So this seems the tabellones of a basis of a basis.
When we are going to go to these very long long long as 100 miles, more directly than 100 miles, will will not growing in Ecool.
You get to the limate limited instruments of the molecular biology
So we consider other mechanisms.
We knew about another mechanism called recombination called recombination is using DNA biology to repear the DNA gram to repeak the universe the segments.
Here's a example.
This organism, called Deinocock-radiodary can three million radioddgen to three million radiation.
You can see in the requader as his cromosomes like his cromosome.
In 12 -- 24 hours comes reassembled as it was primal --
They were thousands of organisms I have a lot of doing it.
These organisms can set to be completely to be totally to be totally to be totally to be completely.
They can live underneath below it.
They're absolutely certain life exists in space, and you spoke for the environments of water.
In the real real real NASA showed that this aven.
This is a picture of the molecules that we built using these process, just using the boundaries of the segments of segments from inserious segments from inseven from inseven to inserious segments from the inseven of the molecules.
The lievit them assembly the automatically
This image is not been taken with a microscope of electronic, but with a microscope of rule.
It's a very big molecules that we can see the with a microscopy that we can see it with a microscope of it.
These are picture that they covered a period of about six seconds.
This is the published that we did a long time ago.
They're more than 58,000 lects code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genet.
It's the largest molecules of a definited structure ever created by man.
It has a fish, a molecular fish.
If we were passive with a carefully 10 without spaces, there would just be 142 pages to be transmit this genetic code that genetic code that genetic code that genetic code of the type of the top.
Now, how do we do it work? We can activate that?
Of course, we track a virus is a game play from girls.
It's a little bit more complicated when they use of bacterial bacterial
It's simpler than the cell phones as our eucariot as our res: you simply to be able to get a nuclear and insert a challenging process clon.
In the bacterial araea is instead is instead of the cell in the cell, but we recently showed that we are able to do a trapile trapiing a cell trapier from a cell of a cell activate and it.
We can do a cromosomes from a micromosometimes in a microbial species
The two are different as humans as mans of the topis.
We have added some genes in more way, that you could decide what choice,
And then sciously has been with the inspired ines.
And when we put in the cellule was stuff -- and you appreciate our graphic soffer -- the new cromosh is going to go to the cell.
And we thought we don't think we could go to the olds, but we tried to go to the ly.
This is one of the most examples of evolution.
We found that antime a few species have added a second or a third or a third of the other hand, add of a second new tracks.
So who think about the evolution as a gene gene and time you think it doesn't understand the biological sky has no understand the biological modisease.
They were called the restrial income in the restrial restrial restrial dedestore the DNA.
The cromosomes that was in the cell as a cell as a one.
The cell phon-cromosomes we inserito--ha.
It is expressed and it recognized the other hundred of the extraney, and we returned out with only the cell and the new crumother.
It becomes blue blue of the genes we insert.
And in a short of time, all the careful career of a kind of game, and it turns out and turned out of the new software that we insert in the cell phones that we were inserved in the cell.
All the protein are changed, members are changed, and when we gain the genetic code of the equid of what we transfer we transfer to what we transfer than we transfer it.
Now, this may seem to look at chemy chemy software DNA we can change the things in maniuum in the hand.
Now, I explained that there is not the parts of genesis -- but of progress from three million years and a half of evolutionary evolutionary version of the explosion of Cambrian explosion of Cambana where they will trum new species that will create new species on this process of the digital process of the digital evolutionary process of the genessional evolutionary and a new species of years and a new version of
Why do we do that?
I think it's obvious enough when we think about our necessity.
We're going to go to six billion and a half of the next 40 years.
And I think of a example: I was born in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for took a nesist in 1946; in 46; in 40 years, will be four years,
We're going to find food, and food, water and clean and clean and basix billion and a half a half of people.
It will be more harder to do it for us.
We lized five billion carbon of carbon of carbon of barbbonger of barbs.
And it means a hundred million barre-millions of bars.
When we try to find biological processes or any of process to replace to repirate and that is going to be a challenge.
We have to keep the most of CO2 emission of CO2 from these materials that finished in the atmosphere.
At day today, thank you for scientific discovered with about 20 million genes, we have a fourth with about 20 million genes, and I like to think that are components for the future.
The electronic industry is only about a dozen dozen of a components, and think about how many different are coming out.
Our are limited by the reality and our imagination.
We have a techniques, thank you very much, thoddy of synthetic synthetic to create what we call genomic combinatoria.
We are able to build a big robot that can produce a million-cromosomes a day.
Think of process these 20 million genes or trying to prove the process of optimize the processes to produce or drugs, new vaccines, we can change a lot of the biology of the biology of science.
And it's just a standard.
We can choose to chance to survive, prodution of survive or carbon or carbon or carbon vaccines.
This is an instantly some software programmed on which we're working for us to be able to be able to be able to be able to computer.
Well, we don't know necessarily how they will be like to be year.
We know exactly coming out of their genetic code in the genetic code of it.
We're concentrate on the carbon of the generation.
You also seen you seen you seen out of the grand the floor was a windowing in the window.
We have carbon and generation of the second and generation that will surround enough pretty pretty much as the type of butanol.
But the only way the biology can have a big impact with no increasing major major the foot of foot and limited the availability would be transforming CO2 in materials that we're working for the earlier, and we think of the earlier that they can reach the cells that they can reach the early coogeneration in the time and we think of the early 18 months.
The sunlight solar combined with CO2 is a metodom -- but in our discovered in the world, we found different metodies.
This is a organism that we described in 1996.
It has in the ocean deep about 2500 feet of the ebooks.
It reduced by CO2 using hydrogen molecular as a power of energy.
We're trying to figure if we can inchance, which can be transported to be transported to be transported to be transportation that CO2 in carbon that CO2 in carbon this process.
So what I'm going to think we could be able to increase what the question of the basic question, "What is Noy, true, and we have the pretty oil -- we have the oil.
And if you don't do it from TED, where you can do it from TED, where you can do that?
It would be a main of energy.
And I mean, we're working for the same metoddy to make vaccines to create vaccines.
You seen this year with the influence, we always go back and with a year and a dollars in less when it comes to find the right vaccine to find the right vaccine of the right now.
I think that what you can change building vaccinable to change in antician.
Here's how the future could start seem to start seem to change it, the evolution with the evolution with the evolution with the bacteria and infinally indegrees cells.
We are so much from the best people.
Our purpose is to live enough to try to try to make a long way to try to make a very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
First of all I will see the most rapidly possible, some of the new technology that we bring to Microsoft in followed a water in the followed a year ago -- it's Seeragonon. This is Seeragonon. This is Seeragon.
It's a local that you can interact is to interact with a local that remote with a huge amount of visual data from visual data from visual data in which you can interact with a local amount of visual data that you can interact with a locar of the envisual data that you can interact
And here we're seeing a lot of gabytet of photos with a kind of drugital and continuous fast, to a speed of the pictures like we want to do the images as we want to do you to do this as we want to do this as we want to see a lot of the digital gabytetal of pictures of the digab
And not important how big the amount of information that we see it, as we see a big data or the data or the data or images.
Most are communities are communities, but this for example, this is a provide of the Congres-old scansion of the Congres-old gapses of the Congresss.
It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that limitation of a system like this is the number of a place in any time.
This is a book inter, example, for example,
This is the Casa desolated Dickens. Every cool represents a capitol.
And to show you that it is just about text and you don't image you can do something like this, to see really do something that is about a representation of the textent representation of the text of the text text of the text that you can do a picture.
It may be a little way to read a book, to read a book,
You don't look at it.
This is a more realistic example, it's a more realist.
Every picture is the beginning of a section.
And it will really give you the pleasure and the beautiful version of a read read version of a view or a quote or a quote of a very strong molecules.
We also did something with the angle of this number of Guardian.
We created a published advanced to other, and more than that you use in a normally resolution -- and we inserve in a normal publish.
If you want to see the carry careful careful carefully of this auom.
Or other models, or even the specific specific specific of the techniques.
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limited limited space.
We hope that this means to put it up and other hundred and other hands and other similar bring to it.
Of course, the map is one of the most obvious applest of technology.
And I don't want to lose the time, if we don't want to say that we don't have to say that we have contributes in this field.
These are all the streets in the U.S. soving a picture of the NASASA.
So now we go to something else.
This is actually from the websk; you can go to the webs; you can go to see it.
It's a project called Photosynth, which combined two different technology.
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual research of the University of the University of the University of Washington, with the See Seitz Selish Selisi Selish Selish Selish Rick Selish Selish Selish Selish Selish Seeelish Selish Selish Selish Sethop Seelish Selish Selish Selish Selisi Selish Selish Selish Seeelish Selip
And it's from the web, gestured by Seadragon.
You can see it when we do this kind of screen to see a screen of the screen to another and have this kind of experience to solve the month.
But the spacal collocaon the space, it has actually a meaning of the images in the images of the images here has a meaning.
The Grehorithms of the computer have recorded these images together, so that they recorresponds to the realities that I imagined -- all the next closer to the Grashs on the Grashs on the Montagagage. Here you can see the real-showing stabouset of a slide-show of a pattern.
I don't know if I have time to show you some environment.
And there are a much more space.
I want to go directly to one of the nice set of Noah-- and this is from a previous previous previous previous of Photosynthosynthosynthese, to show you what I think is really going to show you what I think we are going to be the weak this technology, Phosynthosynth. And it's not necessary. And it's not necessary.
We had to worry about the legal and saying it.
This is a rebuilding in Noth catter Dame pictures from Flickr. Basta digitate Dame Basta Flicklickr and you get images of types and you see images of the walks, and you say. Ognize that you have a picture that you have to discovered a picture that is discovered to this model.
So I'm all the pictures from Flickr and were all colleged in this way.
And it's possible to navigate in this simple way to navigate in this simple way.
You know, I would never think I would never think about to work for Microsoft.
It's very gratefic account this kind of accool we have to receive.
I think you can see that it is a lot of different types of fun of photoamer: from those photos in those phones in those phones in those phones together.
And if you reach us to try to try to those strange.
Many are blocks, excare blocks, etc.
And somewhere here is a series of photographs -- excited --
This is a Notos of Notrecorrectable.
We can go from the placer to the physical places of this environment.
The essential point is that we can do with social things with the environment. This is taking from all the interest memory of how to appears -- and collect all of those data together.
Everybody become colleged together, most of the particular set of the particular set of the particular set of the particular set of the particular.
You've got a model of the earth that emerge.
Think about this as a long way of Stephen Lawler on Earth.
It's something that grows in complexity in complexity that people usually usual for who are using the people who use use.
Their picture are marked with metaphors from other people.
If someone is the idea of contrast all these selling says the name of Notage of Noth Dame Dame Dame Dame Dymmes of all those dates, and the point of all those dates, and the point of the engineing for the engineer of the space, using the checken and a cross-us-usering type and a cross-us-user type and cross-user type and the cross-user.
Of course, a consequence of all of the extremely elaborated virtual of the earth of the earth -- you don't only only only money from the earth and satellitaries and satellitaries and million, but the memory of the collective view of the earth of the earth.
Mille gram of it.
World Worson: I realized you well? What your software going to do is that one point, in the next years, all the photographs are going to be practice and shared by anyone in the world will be practiced with anyone in the world will be practiced with that?
BA: Yeah. What is doing in practice is discovered.
It is creating hyperlink, if you want to be involved in images.
And it's doing it in the base of the images.
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the recket, that many of these images that many of these images that many of these images that are possibly going to be very interesting information of these images that are going to be very interesting for the recket.
How do you make a research of images on the websquare and the head of the websky has a lot of information about the pictures of the photos.
Now, what happens if that picture is a picture of your photos at all of your photos --
So the amount of interconnection to the seeds and the amount of reckets that is really enormous amount of rety. It's a classic effect of the rety.
CA: Blaise, it's really incredible.
BA: You thank you very much.
One of the principal pleases when you travel and one of the research is the power in the wind who has not begone in the wind that translation the past, took the past, the touch of the plants of plants.
Basti thinking that sciamness Jaguar is still over the Viiive Viia, or which is still in Himalaya-hysety or that is still in Himalayay, the good ddistinct of the Dharmal the remind the importance of the antropolo-gay, and that the idea that we live not exists in the idea that we live not exists in the world that we don't exists in sense in a model, but it's a model of the world
the consequence of a particular choices that our stirps that our stirps or mals, and a lot of generations.
And, of course, we all shares we all share of essential tracks.
We all have to be procreise it.
We are subjects to ritual rights.
We have to do we have to deal the morting, so we don't surprised and -- and so we don't surprised and ballooks.
We have a art of it.
What I mean, the real-clumbbing of canzone, the range of every culture.
It doesn't matter that they are the Earth of the Borneo, or the Haity, or the Haity, or the warriers of the desert Kenya settery of the World World World World World World War and the Sahara.
He was my journey in the desert of journey in the desert of the yak in the vallyak in the valli walls of the world. And the Everest, the demother of the world.
All these populations teaching us are other ways of existing other ways of thinking about other models of thinking about other models in the world.
And if you get a attimes a atmate, is a concept that can give you hope.
And in the world are cultures of the world create a ragnant life spiritual and cultural life that I wanted the planet and it's important for the planet and it's important for the beginning.
And you can think about this cultural cultural ignate; it can be a seven and you can definitely the hot of all the conceptive concept of all the concept of all the consciousness to be the imagination from human imagination from human consciousness from the consciousness of the consciousness of the consciousnes;
The patrimonths is the patrimoney.
It's the symbult of what we can be as a species of what we can be in how inquise.
And sure it as the biosphered was graving to the age age is happened to the age and purtrouble and purtrouble.
No biology, for example, for example, it would be about 50 percent of all the species of the extinct because it is the most address -- in the most adpopulsed -- in the most address -- and not closer to the point of the biological diversity -- that the differentery -- that the different.
The indict of all is, of course, the perdity language.
When you were born in the language, in the language.
A language is not just compose from a vocabolary or from a series of rules of rules.
One language is the human spirit of human spirit
It's the meeting with which the animation of every culture is in the world material in the material world.
Every language is a forest of the mind, a wind, a thinking of the spiritual ecosystem of possibility of spirituals.
And of those 6,000 language, while we're here in Monterey, alleast the half is not more sussurprised in the orecks.
They don't have any more teaching children, which means that you want to walk something, which are morting.
What is more tristes than the sless, the beautiful language, the last to talk a language of the English, not to transmit the sky of the wish of the kids?
This is a real-week of someone in some of the world every two weeks, every two weeks a walking and leads with souls in the tombs of a ancient language.
And I know someone is going to tell you "It's not better than that?
The world would not be a better place if we talk about all the same language in the same language, then we all all talk about yuba. We all talk about it.
Let's look at the time.
You're going to talk about a track of the English track the language.
I would like to do you make you a journey through the etnispace,
a little journey in the hourselves to give you a little journey of what we're lost on.
Most of us forget that when I say "different different ways of existers" in existing exist.
We take for example, this bimbo Barasana, in Amazony settentrial population that credies to come from the river, which creates of the debt of the debt dealt of the patterns of the patterns of the patent.
It's a popull that it's not able to distinguishing the blue color, because the celesties is identified in the forest, from which is identify in the forest, from which depends on the popul.
They have a language and a language and a mathemthem, ""Hewish language in language that the language that the language that the language.
And all has radiced in the mythological past, all the particularity is that in these families are are or sets are are or sets or spot of the women.
They listening to listening and then they start talking about.

They have a picture of the earth, they have gone to the research of a shape or a figury or a figury that was diaving, and they have killed to the die and kills with the five miles.
But Waorans don't just killed only kills the strange of it.
They killed in the lorse between them.
The 54 percent of mortality was because of their mortality was because of their mortality was because of their mortality was because of their mortality was causing from their mortality.
We have been seen generations and we found two cases of more, and we found two of course, and when we insisted to know that one of them was instead of them was instead, and then they killed it was a touch that I knew it.
The cycles were able to recognize the animal's field and recognized the species.
In the first 1980, I was assigned a very interesting compied when my professor when my professor Harvard to Harvard to Haitites to Haites to the pot society of Duvarious and the Tonton Macouts, and imposed to do the the basic charge of the velenused and imposed to do the zombies.
To sense of the mirace, I would have to understand the Vodouble, and that Voodom is not nera.

So you know, you know, these incredible eventents were going to touch a type of trance that touch charges a demonstration of the power of the power of the power of the power in the body when they catalyzed in a state of excitation.
And I all the popules I lived with which I lived the most extraordinary of the Sierra Nevada Santa Marta, in the Colombia in Colombia in Colombia settered settrional settered in the Santa Pentrilled the most extraordinary population of the reonal Nevada de Santa Marty of the Nevada de Santa Mart's Santa Po-bottom.
Something that we were living the tyrang that once they were living on the Colombia in the conquist, the population of the conquist that was going to be on the ballock that erge was going to be aware of the carb.

It's possible to summers just sustances with other sustances that money money who are money to be able to be the MAO.
Now it's the beautiful the bolin-carbon are in this bookers are ininbitors are inbitors of the same kind of potentiate to potential to potentiate the triamine. The question of flexies -- in a flexies that are -- and they found two deates -- they think of two dead, but if you combined a very biochemical version that is that is that you are we going to be a very music that is the particular to the particular --
We use the great euphemism and the error, which can reveal infror, which can be revealing it.

This tribe, the Cofan, has 17 variety of aya-ayhuasca, which is that they were in the forest, and that are going to be in the same species.
If we ask them as they are going to say their tassons will tell us "I think I think, I thought I think I didn't know all of you took not know all of this?" I said, "No."
The solution is, they take 177-variety in a different slide and each other.
With this is not going to Harvard, but it's much more interesting than the stames.
Now, the problem is that the problem is that the problem is that they found them in the population of the reduces that are coming background of the history of the respect of the real-in-world and past on the world and go to our real world and past the world

And if you give you a look at the world, you will discovered that these are not destiny to comparish.
They're creatures and dynamics out of the instance, from the instance, which will beyond their adaptype of adaptype of adaptype of it.
And that is that we will track in the patria of the deal of the guy --
a populse of Sarawak, in the sou-asic source that has lived up in the forest information in the forest information in a generation and the prostitution, and the prostitution, where you can see the booked and the rivers that seems to be a milar in the midle Borneo MMarCinese Mar Cinese Mar Cinese Mar Cinese Maravilizing Mardioness,

We want to live in the world, or we want to live the world, or we want to get the policy?
The big anthropology Mead, before his horigins said that his greatest count was that, in our vision was that in our vision of the world, we don't only see the whole gamma of human imagination of human imagination -- but a reduced limited a modality to a result of thinking about a lost of the human mind that there were a lost of mind that there were other possibility that there were possibly possibly possibly possibly possibly deed to us to see the whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole gamong.

We want to talk about cavargue with nothing in the nothing to you can do it? And thised in different ways, is the symbuly of the resilience of the population of the population of the world.
In the 1999 government in 1999 government government to the Inuit to the Inuit of a territorial territorial and Texas the Texas Texas Texas wesas Tex.
It's their new patria. It's called Nunavoid Nunavut.

And in the finally, I think it's pretty obvious is in those of us was in these gar-remote of the planet, make sure that they don't have remoty.
For someone is home.
They represented sections of human imagination that they are at the time, and we all have set of these children, as the set of our children, become part of the hope.
For finally, we have National Geographic we are convines that political never to anything to nothing that will never get anything to nothing to nothing to nothing to nothing that are never going to do anything to now.
We think the polemial polemies --
[Apple] they don't persuasive, but we think the stories can change the world, and maybe we think the best institution, and maybe we can tell the stories of the world.
156 Pathese, they transmit our phone --
Our reviews are literally led by millions of people.
Our work is to travel in the etnic hame, in the hot of the wonderful cultural floors that they went to the revealed as they saw abbrbrary of the antropoloy: the central world of anthropoloy: the central world -- and we have to find a style in a world world of life in a place in a place of life.
which is the sanding of all the popules can contribute to our benefit to our well.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some things I written in this book that I hope I hope to be able and provery, very much and provery, very few college in the case of the college of the college I wrote them in the case I write you know,
I want to start with what I call "the office dog.
The official official dog,
The official official society industrial society industrial society industrial society recent the recent society is to be our citizing the beneath of our citizens to be able to deal with the freedoms to be individual."
The reason that the liberty is in the fact that the liberty is in the same a value, is preciously useful for human beings.
One of the one is that if we are liber, one of us can account for just to do what we are liber, without any one one that decided in us.
The way to massimizing the freedom is to massimizing the choice.
More choices people are liber, more liber, and most of them is their freedown, is their freedown.
These are so foundly radicated in society that no one is that no one would put it in the two-hundred to put it in the two-found.
And it's also foundly radicated in our lives.
I'm going to show you some examples of what the progress.
This is my surprise. It is not to particularly big it.
I allowed a simple named non-in-saved half of the instance.
In my surnow, there are 175 conditions, without contribalances of the variety of olive olive and 12 acets that you can buy a numbers of condition, which is a numbers of conditions in the sciousness of the scientists that nobody of the degrade of your gradments is of your degrads.
Here's the surprising surprising surprise.
Then you go to the electronic snegotie to buy a stere: casslector CD, radio, plast, printing --
And in this single snegotial of electronic components of carefully cars.
We can make six million different six and a half million combinations that there are in a nice negotie.
You have to love that there is a lot of choice.
Other walk: the world of communications.
One times, when I was a child -- they could get all the services of the phone was wishabled by mamma Bell.
He read the phone -- not the phone -- you don't buy it was bought to buy it.
One consequence of that, in the other, was that the telephone is not a mother.
These are gone --
We've got a variety of the phone set of the phone of the phone of the cells.
Here's the future.
My favorite is the MP3, MP3, the MP3, and the hundred in the hund of the crash.
If you don't have the case I don't have seen in the case, you're going to preve in the case, you're going to preve it.
And what happens is that people are in the negozes and do this question, and do that question is, what the answer? The answer? The answer is "No."
It's not possible to buy a cellular cells that not too much too much of it.
So in other life expects are much more important than the water expect the same explosion of choices.
Assistance of health health ssistance, not succeful succeed from doctor and the doctor and the doctor what you have to do.
And I walked from the doctor, and the doctor saying, "Okay, we could do A, "A, you can do you have these wells and these wells these wells and these wells and these wells and these wells and these wells and these well.
He says, "Dr, what I'd should you do?"
And the doctor says, "At these wells and these wells and these wells and these answer and these answer and these answer and these answer and these wells and these well.
"What do you want to do you to do that?"
And you can rebate it was "Dottor if she was me, what do you dob?
And the doctor, "But I'm not le."
The result of the result of the diato," expressure that it seems to seems a beautiful things.
But it's not that one is that one spoke and the responsibility of the remarkable decisions someone who know someone who know anything else -- and almost certability is not a -- and so is not in the conditional conditional conditional to take the ideal to take the idea of the real egging the patient.
There's a marketing marketing property of products, I direct people like me and you, and you think you don't buy any sense, which is not to buy it.
But if we can't buy buy buy them to buy them to buy them --
The answer is that they want to do the doctor of the clean to change the rectent to change the rected.
And so foundation as our identity is a walking of choice, as you see in this view in this view of the children, we don't want to force, they will not want to force. We don't want to force. We don't want to be an identity: we have to do it.
And we can reinvented us how many times you can get us to reinvent.
The one means that every morning, to the rise, you have to decide that kind of people wants to be able to be there.
And the family and the family and the matrimon, a time the prospective to anyone who was that you can see that it was that you could set the most pretty possible, and it was starting to the most pretty possible.
The only only true, it was with choice, not quands, and even what do down.
Ogay everything is really to play.
I was very smart at a very smart of the respect of a respect of a time.
And because they don't are good good good good at least because they're less deligent.
But why I am impensive I mean ask I said, "I would have to do you know, I would do you do it now, I would do it now, I would do it now,
"I would have to be able to get you to think before I think before I was going to charge?
They're interrogative logant.
And they try to answer these questions, even if this imply doesn't completely completely the compites that they are not to get a voice to my exam.
And they have to do that. I asked the questions of it.
Now, the work: we are lucky, like Carl Carl Carl technology we allows to work every single minute, every single day, every y-tell.
It was parents there is a corner, and I don't tell you anybody where the Wii Fi Fii Fi Fi work.
I don't say that, because I want to use it.
What does that mean, this incredible liberty of choice, we have to decide that we have to decide or decide we have to work or not.
We can go to see our child play to calculate in a tasca, Blackberry in the other, and the nonek, and the nursing and non-kbergy.
And even though they're all of, every minutes that we see our child can we see our child can say, "I have to answer this called called "ata?"
"I have to answer this email? I have to habbodies that letter?"
And even when the answer is "nothing that makes the experience of your child was very different than what it would be in other condition.
So from any side of any of this, things and big things and large materials and the stily is a lot of life, the life is a choice.
Once the world was that, there was some chance of chance choice, but it was a choice.
The world today is a little bit like this, the dilemma is "It's a positive negative, or negative, or negative, or negative.
The answer is Saway.
The positive positive them all of the negative negative negatives
And this choice behaviors in two negative effects on the gently.
The first more, paradoxyment is that they are reliberation.
With options that I choice, it becomes very difficult to do it.
I want to offer a mean an an example of thinking about the plane of thinking about the plane of thinking about it.
A college has been access to the data of the Vankay, the ganten-house society of thinking about a million climbed clients in 2,000 different companies.
What she found is that for every 10 solutions that are offered in the more, the percentage of adesequal of adesions of the 2.
With 50 source of offers, there's 10 percent of the adesions of when they are available to when they are available to be available to be available to have a 5.
Because with 50 source that choice that choice is hard to decide and the choice comes to the inintegrated to inquestions.
And at the questions, and I won't asked questions, and of course, questions, and of course, it goes up.
You know, it doesn't just mean that these workers who are going to eat foose because they don't have enough money, it means because they don't have to say that the decision is so ostic that they lost the pleasure of complex work.
It is not a lot of working on the druging of working on the dator of work, which would be well to be able to versus to the them.
So the paralysis is a consequence of the choice.
And I think that makes the world like this.
"And finally, for the eternity: "Well or major major major major major major major major major main?
You would just take the right decision to take the right decision of the eternity, right?
You don't want to choose the basit and the wrong condition.
So this is the first effect. The second is that if we could evitate the paralysis and do a choice, and we have less to be able to be able to be able to be with less of how we will be able to choice.
And this is a different reasons.
One of these is that with a lot of these is that you would buy a choice and it's not perfect and it's not perfect to do a different choice, and that would be better to do a different choice that happens is that the alternative imagined us to be better than the choice, and the receiving the soddds, and the received sods, and the received soddddisory of the decision of the decision
even when it was a very optim decision.
More choice, more easier than any details of any details that it's insoddsatisssed to choice.
And yet there's what economists called opportunity called opportunity.
Dan Gilbert has clearning as much as the value value that we think about the things that we confront with what we confrontive it.
You know, when there are many options are possibly options is easy to represent the careers of the alternal characternal and be less sods:
Here's a example. I use with all of New York.
But it's what probably probably thinking.
There's this copy of Hamptons.
A place of sush.
It is splendea. Otype day.
Not nothing that he thinks is, "Well, the thinks is, "Well, Agostod."
"All my nearly closer to Manhattan are vie."
"I could talk about just just parking in front of home."
And in two weeks from the idea that perdrug from the idea that perdrug -- every day -- the possibility of parking where you want.
The cost of opportunity diminuished the soddisfation for what we have been excellent was excellent was excellent to be excellent was excell.
And more of the options we have to look at the most careful careful careful to be as expensive against how it expensive against how it is a opportunity.
Here's another example.
This view of things.
We talked about the live to live the liver living living there.
But the most important point is that any thing you choice, you choices you don't do the other.
The things that we don't choice have a lot of attraent that can make less less attraent what we do.
Terging point, spiral growing expectance.
I tried on my pelle patterning a new jeans.
I was almost always jeans.
Once jeans were a type of a type and westiving from the best, and they were comoddded to have a lot of times, they were starting to well.
So I went to buy a couple of a new new when the old old old old the old old old of jeans, and I said, "I need a couple of jeans, this is my cut."
And the coming thing I said, "You want to slim and said, "You want to slim and I said, "Does it?"
He wants with the cernic hedwing? "Stonished bottonished hed"Wed," or ""Yed?
"You want to do you want to do you to do that?"
"You know, you want to get them or strettty? Bla blue -- Continuged to elenses to elenses.
I was spoke and after a little bit I could say, "I want to do the kind -- which was the only one guy -- which was the only one guy was so so so I was going to try to all the stones that I was going to try to all the stones from the negod, with the best jeans, and the best jeans, and then I was going to have it.
It was the mas. Here's all that choice had a half the basis.
But I heard I felt I was worst worst worst I heard I heard I heard I heard I heard I heard I heard I heard I heard I heard I heard I heard I heard I heard I heard I heard I heard I felt.
Why? I wrote a book to understand it.
The reason I was worst worst is that I was worst with all that choices were altish -- the jeans had to be perfect to be perfect to be perfect to be perfect to be perfect to be perfect with all that choices were altising the middle of the mo
And I started expectations I didn't expectations of expectancy when you exception was just a type of 100 different guys -- and at least a kind of being perfect.
What I had water was good one-on-perfect --
After I was working on the expect with what I was trying to insodded in confronfronfront of the expectance.
The add of options in life of the options that these are not going to forward the expectations that have respectance.
And this will be less soddisplant, even when the results are good ones.
No one in the marketing world of marketing if you do do it.
Because if you know that, you don't know what I'm talking about.
The truth.
"He was better when she was worst when she was worst when she was worst when you were worst when you were worst when she was worst when it was still possible to meet the surprised to meet of the surprising surprised to meet the surprised please.
Ogay in the world where we live -- opulent, industrialized citizens with the perfect -- the perfect that we can hope is that things are at the head of the expectance.
You never never resurprised to the expectance, because your expectance, the middle expectance.
The secret of happiness -- the thing you are -- "Yes, you know, "Yes, you want to him."
I mean, I mean, I mean, the authobiographic moment -- I really sposed and my wife is really stuff is really stuff --
I could not do a better I have a better better I don't have a measured.
But I don't always have a good thing.
And finally, a consequence of the jeans of jeans is that when you are only that jeans is that when you don't know while you don't know when you don't know what?"
"Who is responsible responsible is clear.
The world is responsible responsible to do we do?
When there are hundreds of jeans, and you buy a insodds, and you wonderful you who are the responsible is that you have the responsible is so much as you are all the responsible that you are you.
You might have a better better do better.
