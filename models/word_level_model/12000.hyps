<unk> year I showed these <unk> to <unk> that the <unk> <unk> <unk>, which for almost three million years had the size of the United States <unk>, it's <unk> 40 percent.
And we <unk> this <unk> of the problem because it doesn't show the ice <unk>.
<unk> <unk> is, in a certain sense, the heart of the climate change.
It's <unk> and <unk> in the summer.
The next <unk> will be a <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of the last 25 years.
<unk> <unk> are <unk> in red.
You see, you can see it down to the blue <unk>.
That's the ice in <unk>, which <unk> summer.
You can see that the <unk> ice <unk>, of five years, and more, is like the blood, which is <unk> here.
<unk> years, it's been <unk> by so,
This is a problem because the <unk> are interested in the <unk> <unk>, where there are huge <unk> of <unk> that, <unk> are <unk> in <unk> by <unk>.
<unk> at the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, that amount could <unk>, that amount of <unk>, <unk> this point of not <unk>.
In some <unk> <unk>, the <unk> is already <unk> by water.
The <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> last <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>! <unk>: She's good. The question is if we <unk> it.
And it's a reason that <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk>.
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> had never <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This is the <unk> river, in the <unk> of the <unk>.
If you want to know how the sea level of the sea level for the <unk> <unk>, here is where you're <unk>.
These <unk> are <unk>.
<unk> other part of the planet: <unk>, the biggest <unk> of ice on the planet.
<unk> <unk>, <unk> scientists who <unk> that the <unk> of the ice is in <unk>, and that the <unk>, which <unk> on some <unk> <unk>, is particularly <unk> in the <unk>.
<unk> at <unk> meters of the <unk>, like <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, the third largest <unk> of ice, you see new <unk>, which a few years ago,
40 percent of the world's population will <unk> half of the water from that <unk>.
<unk> <unk>: This <unk> is the source of the water <unk> of this city.
<unk> is <unk>.
But when you <unk>, the same happens to water.
<unk> California on the <unk> <unk> is <unk> 40 percent.
<unk> <unk> are in the crisis.
<unk>, like you've read, like, they're <unk>.
<unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> to a <unk> <unk>.
<unk> are <unk> out of the normal and <unk>.
Sometimes, over the last 30 years, as <unk> <unk>.
This is a <unk> of all <unk>.
If you look at the context of the <unk>, you can see the <unk>.
In the last five years we've <unk> 70 million <unk> of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million <unk> in the ocean every day.
Look at the <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and on both <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, where there's a <unk> <unk> of oxygen in the ocean.
The <unk> of global <unk>, together to the <unk>, which is 20 percent, is the use of <unk> <unk>.
<unk> is a problem, and <unk> is even worse.
The United States is one of the United States is more emissions, together with China.
And they <unk> to build a lot of other <unk>.
But we're <unk> to a <unk> direction.
These are the projects <unk> in the last few years and some <unk> of <unk>.
So, there's a <unk> politics in our country.
<unk> <unk> and oil <unk> have <unk> million dollars in the last year to <unk> <unk> <unk>, which is a <unk>.
<unk> image, I'm going to do something --
<unk> <unk>, in <unk>, where I live, there's been a <unk> of <unk> billion <unk> <unk>.
Maybe you've seen it on the <unk>.
This is the second <unk> flow of <unk> in America.
It's happened around <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> of one of the <unk> <unk> was this.
<unk>: <unk> the <unk> is a <unk> <unk>, a <unk> <unk>.
It's <unk> here in America, and we grow our economy.
<unk> the <unk> is <unk>.
It's <unk>, <unk> and <unk> <unk> it.
<unk>: <unk> here is a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The largest society <unk> on the <unk> is <unk>. This is his <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> <unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk> -- Al <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> -- they don't know what they're talking about.
<unk>: So <unk> for <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This is a one of them, a part.
<unk>: <unk> <unk>, <unk>, we see the changes as a <unk> <unk> in our business.
So, our <unk> is <unk> a big amount of money in a <unk> <unk> to make public and <unk> the truth.
In fact, <unk> is not <unk>.
We think it's <unk> -- it also has a good <unk>.
So we don't know about climate change.
We're going to do.
<unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk> -- you have heard a lot of it.
So we <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk>, to the <unk> of <unk>.
<unk>! The machines are a little <unk>, but that's the sound of the technology of <unk>.
<unk> <unk> is between the main <unk> of global <unk>, but the technology of <unk>, but the technology of <unk> that you see everything.
And we look at this: this is the <unk> technology of <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk> to the economic <unk> and the <unk> of national security.
<unk>: <unk> America is in the crisis; the economy, the <unk>, the national crisis.
The <unk> that <unk> all: our <unk> <unk> <unk>, like <unk> and oil <unk>.
Now, but there's a new, <unk> solution to <unk>.
<unk> America: 100 percent of <unk> energy, in 10 years.
A <unk> plan to <unk> America to work, <unk>, and help <unk> global <unk>.
<unk>, a solution that we <unk> our problems.
<unk> America. <unk> more.
<unk>: This is the last.
<unk>: It's about <unk> energy to America.
One of the most <unk> ways of <unk> <unk> to the <unk> that <unk> our planet.
<unk>: The future is here. <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
<unk> <unk>: <unk> <unk> for jobs <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> America. It's time to be <unk>.
<unk>: A old <unk> <unk> says, "If you want to go, you go to.
If you want to go away, you go together. "
We need to go away, quickly.
Thank you very much.
<unk> year at TED, I did a <unk> on the <unk>.
And we're going to try to <unk> how the car works.
So here. And for those that, for those that there were no, the <unk> is the largest scientific <unk> experiment ever <unk> -- <unk> miles of <unk>.
His task is to <unk> the conditions that were <unk> less than a <unk> <unk> from the beginning of the universe -- until <unk> million times a second.
That's just <unk>.
This is the <unk> machine.
And we <unk> these <unk> <unk> into the <unk>.
This is what I work. It's called <unk> -- is <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>.
This is a picture of <unk> in building, so you can see the <unk>.
<unk> last year, we <unk> the car for the first time.
And this picture was <unk> by <unk>.
It was <unk> <unk> in control.
It's a picture of the first <unk> of particles that had done all the <unk>, <unk> in <unk>, <unk>, with a part of the <unk>, and <unk> particles inside the <unk>.
In other words, when you <unk> that image the 10 <unk>, <unk> that the car, which is a great <unk>.
I don't know if it was this to get more or this, when somebody <unk> on Google and <unk> that the <unk> was this.
That means we had a <unk> impact beyond that scientific impact over.
And we had a week later, there was a problem with the car, it had to these <unk> here -- these <unk> <unk>.
These <unk> <unk> <unk> when the car works in the <unk> of the <unk>.
Now, the <unk> between you of you <unk> the <unk> and <unk>, "It's not true. I'm <unk> too <unk>."
And they can do it because when they're very <unk>, they can be the <unk> <unk>.
So, at least <unk> degrees, at a temperature <unk> at that <unk> of space between stars, these <unk> can bring that <unk>.
In one of the <unk> of <unk> in the <unk>, there was a <unk> <unk>.
So the <unk> <unk> <unk>, and the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This was the result.
Now, this is even more <unk> if you think that these <unk> <unk> <unk>, and that's <unk> about 30 <unk>.
It's <unk> about 50 <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, what we did.
We <unk> them and <unk>.
Now, they're all <unk> to their place.
<unk> the end of <unk> the <unk> will be new <unk>.
<unk> it, and we <unk> to get the data to <unk> or <unk>, and keep our <unk> to find out what the <unk> are going to find out what the universe is.
Now, of course, in a certain way, these <unk> <unk> the <unk> of science and <unk>. It's easy to <unk>.
I think that's so hard, the fact that it's going to be so hard, I think that's the value of things like <unk>.
I'd like to <unk> with the words of a <unk> <unk>, which, <unk>, in <unk> of the <unk> experiments of his <unk> was Michael <unk>, he said, "No," <unk> <unk>, "she's so <unk> to the human mind, how <unk> the <unk> that the ideas of science are <unk>, that there are no new, that our <unk> are <unk>, and they are not <unk>, and we don't have <unk>."
Thank you.
I want to start to <unk> <unk> to when, children, <unk>.
<unk> as <unk> and <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> to the way that we <unk> <unk> in the world around us.
So, from <unk> <unk> from our <unk> of <unk> our <unk> with <unk> objects, and my <unk> <unk>, and my <unk> <unk> <unk>, and I started <unk>, and I started <unk>, "And when we use a computer, instead of having the only <unk> of the <unk> as a <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with a <unk>, hands, hands,
and we <unk> our <unk>?
The question was so interesting that we had to explore the answer, building the answer, building the answer.
In a few words, a <unk> is a computer computer <unk> as a <unk>.
In a few words, a <unk> is a computer computer <unk> as a <unk>.
You can <unk> them with your hand, they can say "<unk>" between them, "and they feel their movement and have a <unk>.
But <unk>, they are <unk>, like <unk>, you can just <unk>.
<unk> are the example of a new <unk> of tools to <unk> the digital information.
And as they get <unk>, <unk> of their movement, and they <unk>, and they <unk> their movement, and they become more <unk>, <unk> of the other, of how we <unk> them, and <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We're going to start with some simple example.
This <unk> is <unk> to show you about video: if you <unk> it in a direction, the video <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, so if you go back from the other side.
These <unk> <unk> are <unk> of the other.
If you <unk> them, you get to what's going on.
If they get <unk>, and they can <unk> it and they can <unk> a little bit.
If they get <unk>, and they can <unk> it and they can <unk> a little bit.
They also <unk> their movement and <unk>.
We realized that one of the interesting <unk> of the <unk> was that that we could use <unk> on the data, to example, "<unk> a color as a <unk>.
In this case, we have three <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> and I can <unk> to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk>, where you're <unk>.
and I can <unk> to <unk> color in that central color, where you're <unk>.
If you <unk> too, we can <unk> a little bit of place.
I'm also <unk> possibilities, like <unk>, like <unk>, <unk> and <unk> and games where people can try and things, where people can try things, and <unk> the results immediately.
Now, I'm --
This is a sequence of <unk> that I do with a <unk> program.
Here we have a <unk> of words that is half <unk> and <unk>.
<unk>, every <unk> <unk> a letter to <unk> a letter on every <unk>, <unk>, to every <unk> <unk> a letter on every <unk>, and while I was <unk> in <unk>.
Then, after about 30 seconds, you have a new <unk> of <unk> and new possibilities.
Thank you.
Here's a <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk>, I've done so that I <unk> them and I <unk> a video.
They're very <unk>.
And one of the interesting things of <unk> is that you don't have to give people a lot of <unk>.
You just say, "<unk>", "and they know exactly what to do.
Here's other people who are <unk>.
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> there.
It really wanted to <unk>.
They were just <unk>, for him.
Now, this is a <unk> of a <unk> <unk>.
<unk> building a tool for the <unk> of the <unk>. He's <unk>.
It can <unk> new characters in the scene, <unk> their <unk>.
It can <unk> new characters in the scene, <unk> their <unk>.
So, that's <unk> the sun.
<unk>: The sun is <unk>.
David <unk>: Now, he brought a <unk> in the scene.
<unk>: The <unk> <unk>.
<unk> work! Yeah!
So, we <unk> the <unk> and <unk> can <unk> the characters --
<unk>: <unk>!
<unk> your story.
<unk>: <unk>!
<unk>: It's a story with the final <unk>, and it can decide how to <unk> it.
<unk>: It's a story with the final <unk>, and it can decide how to <unk> it.
<unk>: <unk> away, <unk>.
<unk>: The last example, I've got time to show you is a recent <unk>, and I'm <unk>, to <unk> and <unk> music.
It's a tool, <unk>, <unk> and <unk> music.
<unk> here are <unk> by <unk> as basic, <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> of these four different <unk>, and you can choose what they use.
You can also <unk> these <unk> in a sequence <unk>.
And we just <unk> by making a <unk>, "and a <unk>."
These are actually that you can control from live, like <unk> and <unk>.
And I'm going to <unk> it to a particular sound and then <unk> to <unk>.
And then there are the effects of as time and <unk>, which is <unk> to the entire sequence.
<unk> like that.
<unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk>, in a <unk> <unk>, <unk> in a series, the <unk>, <unk>.
Now, you're going to take a <unk> line.
<unk>: <unk> <unk>. Now, I'm going to <unk> --
<unk>: <unk>, and now I'm going to <unk> the <unk>, so I can control the effect of the live.
<unk>: <unk>: I can <unk> the whole sequence time on a side or the other.
<unk>: <unk>. And now we <unk> the <unk> to <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>: I can <unk> the sequence "<unk>" <unk>. "
So, I don't have to <unk> before, but I can <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
And now, finally, I can <unk> the whole sequence on the left the <unk> "<unk>" <unk> "."
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is building new <unk> <unk> and <unk> to how our brain work and <unk>.
And today, I had time to show you one of this <unk>, and also some possibilities that we try to take out of the lab.
And the concept that I want to <unk> is that's <unk> this new generation of <unk> objects, which <unk> information in our world in our world in the way we want.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the <unk> of you.
I'm a <unk>.
<unk> books is my <unk>, but it's more of this, of course.
It's also the love and the <unk> of my life.
And I don't look like that.
But, something particular is happened in my life and my life, which was <unk> in my life and my career, who <unk> me to <unk> the whole <unk> with this work.
The particular thing is I <unk> wrote this book, this <unk> called "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>" which, <unk> "which, I <unk> from my <unk> books, for some reason to <unk> the world and <unk> a great, <unk>.
And the result is that everywhere <unk> now, people <unk> me as if I was <unk>.
<unk> -- <unk>, <unk>!
I'm going to be <unk>, and they say, "You don't have fear of you not have fear of them, you know," Do you don't have fear of it.
You don't have fear to write for all the life without <unk> to be able to create a book that could <unk> someone? "
that can <unk> to somebody? "
It's <unk>, you know.
But it could be worse, and I remember that over 20 years ago, when I was saying people -- I was a <unk> -- I was a <unk> -- I wanted to be a <unk>.
I'm going to go to the same <unk> <unk>.
And people said, "Don't <unk> to be able to be able to have?
You don't have fear that the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>?
You don't have fear of this <unk> for all life without anything else is that anything that's ever out and die on a <unk> of <unk> <unk>? "
So, you know.
The <unk> answer to all these questions is: "Yeah."
Yeah, I fear of all those things.
I always had fear.
And I also fear of the other things that people wouldn't happen.
How <unk> and other things that are <unk>.
But, to how much it's about, I thought, and I'm <unk> <unk> <unk> is why?
Is it <unk>?
It's <unk> that anybody who <unk> to be <unk> by a job that you can feel like to do.
But what is that so particular in the <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> in a way that <unk> don't do?
How did my father, for example, he was a <unk> <unk> and I don't remember one time in his 40 years of activity in which he was asked if she she was <unk> to be <unk>?
It was never -- that <unk> of the <unk> John, how does it go?
<unk>'t <unk> that, <unk>?
<unk>, the engineers like no group, in <unk>, <unk>, <unk> the <unk> of being <unk> <unk>.
We <unk>, we have enough this <unk>, and not only <unk> but <unk> of all of these kinds, we have this <unk> of being <unk> <unk>.
And they don't know else that look at the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> that, in the <unk> century, young and often, and they are often for their own.
And even those who don't have <unk> to be really <unk> by their <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, before she died, in the last <unk> said, "<unk> my book," <unk> my book, "A extraordinary <unk> about the work of their own life.
But we don't know, we don't know when we heard these things so long that we have completely <unk> and <unk> the <unk> that creativity and <unk> are somehow <unk> and <unk> that creativity are somehow <unk> and that art, finally, <unk> and <unk>.
And the question I want to <unk> all here today is: you're <unk> with this idea?
It's good at you -- because it also <unk> by a <unk> away from a <unk> away away from me, it's not good for this <unk>.
I think it's <unk>.
And I think it's also <unk> and I don't want to <unk> <unk> in the next century.
I think it's better to <unk> our great <unk> to live.
And I certainly know that, in my case -- in my case -- it would be very <unk> to start <unk> to that <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in which I'm in my career.
<unk> -- <unk>, look at the <unk>, I'm pretty young, I have about 40 years.
I still have about four <unk> of work in me.
And it's very <unk> that anything that's going to happen in the world like the work that I <unk> after <unk> <unk> in my last book.
<unk> <unk>, because we're all <unk>, and less friends here -- is <unk> that my greatest success is to my <unk>.
Oh, <unk>, <unk>, that thinking!
You know, this is the kind of thinking that brings a person at nine in the morning and I don't want to do it.
I continue to do this work that I love.
So, the question becomes, how?
And so, it seems to me, after many <unk>, that the way to work to keep <unk> is to create a <unk> <unk> <unk>, right?
I have to have a few <unk> away from <unk> between me, which I'm <unk>, and my natural <unk> to what <unk> <unk> <unk> to get. And as we were <unk> for the last year models of the last year models of how to look through the time, trying to find out out if you have better ideas and <unk> ideas.
about how to help people <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity.
And that research led me to the <unk> <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> because they <unk> in <unk> and then <unk> back.
<unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> -- people don't believe that creativity <unk> from men, OK?
It was <unk> that creativity was this <unk> spirit and that <unk> to men from a few <unk> and <unk>, for <unk> and <unk>, for <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> <unk> these <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of creativity. "
<unk>, <unk>, <unk> to have a <unk> that <unk> <unk> from <unk>.
<unk> were the same idea, but we had that kind of spirit of without a <unk>.
which is <unk>, because the <unk> didn't really know that a <unk> was somebody's very smart.
And I thought that a <unk> was this kind of <unk> <unk> that <unk> literally in the <unk> of the <unk> of a artist, a little bit like <unk> <unk>, and that <unk> out of <unk> the <unk>, and <unk> the result of that I was going to <unk> the <unk> of that work.
<unk> <unk> here, that's the distance of which I'm talking -- that <unk> <unk> you from the results that you're <unk> from your work.
And everybody thought that was so that we were <unk>, right?
So, artists were <unk> by <unk> things, like, for example, the too <unk>, right?
If your work was <unk>, you didn't <unk> all the <unk>, everybody <unk> that was <unk> by this <unk> <unk>.
If your work <unk>, it was not <unk> your <unk>, right?
Everybody <unk> that was your <unk> to be a <unk>.
And so people <unk> <unk> creativity in <unk> for a lot of time.
And then the <unk> and everything, and we <unk> this great idea; we put the human <unk> on the universe over the universe and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> this whole idea of the universe, and we <unk> the center of all of the universe, and
This was the principle of <unk> <unk> and people started thinking about that creativity <unk> of the <unk>.
And for the first time in history, you <unk> to <unk> this, or that artist as a <unk> <unk> that a person with <unk>.
And I have to <unk>, I think it was a big <unk>.
I think that somebody, a simple person to believe that that I think of being as a <unk> as a source, <unk> and <unk> and <unk> to all the <unk> <unk>, <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
It's like to ask someone to <unk> the sun.
<unk> and <unk> completely <unk> the <unk> and makes all these <unk> <unk> on the <unk>.
And I think it's been this pressure to have <unk> artists in <unk> 500 years.
And, if that's true, and I think that's, the question becomes, and right?
Can we do that?
We want to go back to a more <unk> understanding of the relationship between humans and <unk>.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we can't <unk> 500 years of thinking in a 18 minutes.
And probably people in the audience who <unk> <unk> <unk> on their <unk>, <unk>, you do that <unk> people <unk> <unk> on their projects.
You probably don't know about this thing.
But the question I'd like to <unk> is -- why not?
Why don't we <unk> this way?
Because it's more sense of all the other thing that ever heard to explain the <unk> of the <unk> process.
A process that, as anybody who ever <unk> to do something -- so, so basically, all here -- know, you know, you know, you don't <unk> <unk>.
And, in fact, it can look at the <unk>.
I did this <unk> <unk> with the extraordinary <unk> <unk>, who has now 90 years, but that's been a <unk> for all life and said that during his <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> out of the <unk> <unk>, <unk> out of the <unk>, and I <unk> it, in the <unk> <unk>.
And she said it was like a <unk> <unk>.
And that <unk> <unk> to her from the <unk>.
And they <unk> him, because he was <unk> the land under his feet.
And we had one thing to do at that point, and it was, words, "<unk> as a <unk>."
And so we went to home and <unk> from this <unk>, and it wouldn't have to take another one of paper and a <unk> <unk> enough <unk>, and <unk> and <unk> on the page.
Sometimes they didn't start to be fast, so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> the <unk> and she would <unk> her to <unk> through the <unk>, and he would be <unk> through the <unk>, looking for, looking, and she would be <unk> through the <unk>, looking for, and she would have to be <unk> <unk> through the <unk>, and she would have
And then there were those times -- this piece of never -- there were the moments that was almost <unk>, right?
So, he was <unk> home and she was trying to take the paper and <unk> the <unk> through, and he <unk> a <unk> right in the while he was <unk>, and she said, who was how she <unk> with the other hand and <unk>.
<unk> the <unk> from the tail and the <unk> in his body and the <unk> on the page.
And in these cases, the <unk> would be <unk> on the <unk> page, but <unk>, the last word to the first.
So when you <unk> it -- it's <unk>, it's exactly <unk> to my <unk> process.
Not all my <unk> process -- I'm not a <unk>!
I'm a <unk>, and my way of <unk> is; I'm going to <unk> at the same <unk> every day and work and work and <unk> and work and <unk> over and work and <unk> and work and work and <unk> and work and work and work and work and work and work and <unk> and work and work and work and work and work and work and work and work and work and work
But even me, in my <unk>, I <unk> against that thing, sometimes.
And I think that's also a lot of you the <unk>.
You know, even if the work and ideas, I <unk> <unk> from a certain source, I couldn't <unk>.
And what is this thing?
And how can we <unk> it in a way we don't have your head, but rather, that's <unk> us?
So, as I'm about, the best example, I have a <unk> <unk> <unk>, which I <unk> different years ago for a <unk>.
<unk> of this, and you know, <unk>, for the <unk> of life has been the <unk> of the <unk> artist, trying to control, <unk> these species of <unk> <unk> <unk>.
But then <unk>, he was <unk>, and one day while she was <unk> on a <unk> <unk>, <unk> all for him.
<unk> fast and all of a <unk> this little <unk> of <unk>, that comes in his head as <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and the <unk>, but it doesn't know how to <unk>.
It's not a piece of paper, it doesn't have a <unk>.
So you start to feel this kind of old <unk>, <unk> in him, "I'm going to lose, and <unk> <unk> from this song.
I'm not <unk> enough, and I can't <unk>. "
And instead of <unk>, they <unk>.
<unk> the whole process of <unk> and made something completely new.
He just <unk> the sky and said, "You don't see that I'm <unk>?"
"Do you think it can write a song now?
If you really want to <unk>, you'll <unk> it, you'll be a more <unk> when I can <unk> care of you.
<unk>, <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk>. "
And his process <unk> <unk> after this.
Not the work, the work was still <unk> as always.
But the process, and the <unk> <unk> that <unk> was <unk> when <unk> the <unk>, the <unk> that he was <unk> when he <unk> the <unk>, the <unk> that he was, and we had to <unk> that where, was <unk> that it was <unk> and <unk>.
but I was <unk> this <unk>, wonderful <unk> <unk> a conversation between <unk> and this thing that <unk> and <unk> that it was not <unk>.
So, how I would <unk> that story to change a little bit of the way I <unk> and I <unk> once.
This idea, I was <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>," and <unk>, "and <unk> in one of those <unk> in which we're all working on something and we can't do it and you start thinking that's going to be the book.
Not just <unk>, just the book wrote.
And we started thinking about <unk> this project.
But then I <unk> to <unk> that <unk> and <unk>.
So I <unk> my face on the <unk> and <unk> my <unk> to a <unk> <unk> of the room.
And I said to <unk>, "<unk>, what, we know, we know that if this book is not going to be <unk>.
Because you see, I'm <unk> everything I have, I don't have more of this.
So if you want it to be better, you have to <unk> and do your <unk>.
OK. But if you don't do it, you know what, I don't know anything.
I started writing the same because it's my work.
And I'd like to say that it was <unk> that I <unk> to do my part. "Because -- finally, OK -- <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> in Africa, the North people <unk> to <unk> the <unk> <unk>, and <unk> music that <unk> for hours and hours to <unk>.
And they were always <unk>, because the <unk> were <unk> and <unk>.
But every <unk>, <unk>, something <unk>, and one of these artists, actually <unk>.
And I know what I talk about, because I know what I know, you know, at a certain point, a <unk> <unk>.
It was like the time, and the <unk> <unk> through a kind of <unk> and it was not doing anything different from the <unk>, and it was not doing anything different from the <unk>, but it's all <unk>.
And all of a sudden, not just as a human.
But it's <unk> by the <unk> and <unk> in the fire of the <unk>.
And when this <unk>, at the time, people <unk> what was, he <unk> him.
<unk> your hands and <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, God," God, "God," God, "
That's God, you know.
<unk> <unk> -- when the <unk> <unk> <unk>, the <unk> of the <unk>, I <unk> this <unk> with them and <unk> in the <unk> <unk>, "to" <unk>, <unk>, "to" <unk>, <unk>, "which you can hear in the <unk> or in the <unk>.
In <unk>, when a artist has done something impossible and <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> -- a <unk> of God.
And it's <unk> because we need.
But the problem comes the day after, for the <unk>, when you <unk> and <unk> that are 11 <unk> and <unk> 11 <unk> and <unk> <unk> of God's <unk> and <unk> the <unk> of God's <unk> and <unk> the <unk> of God's <unk>.
It's just a <unk> with <unk>, and maybe not <unk> ever to <unk> that <unk>.
And maybe nobody <unk> the name of God still as <unk>, and what do with the rest of his life?
It's hard.
This is one of the most <unk> <unk> to make in a <unk> life.
But maybe it doesn't have to be so <unk> if you can't believe, <unk>, that the <unk> of your being <unk> by you.
But you just <unk> that you have data in <unk> by a <unk> of this <unk> part of your life that you have to go to <unk> else when you're finished.
And, you know, if we think that all change.
And so I started <unk>, and it's certainly like I <unk> it for several months during the <unk> of the book that was going to, the <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> of my <unk> success.
And what I must continue to <unk> when I feel like this is, I'm not afraid to be fear.
Don't <unk>. You just <unk> your work work.
<unk> <unk> for your <unk>, any <unk> can be.
If your work is <unk>, <unk>.
If you <unk>, you will <unk> to you <unk> a few <unk> <unk>, for one moment through your <unk>, then you know, "<unk>!"
<unk>, you do the same <unk>.
And "<unk>!" <unk>! "<unk>."
I think it's <unk> <unk>.
"<unk>!" <unk> it, even for <unk>, even for having had human <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk>: <unk>!
You know, I've been talking about some of these projects on human genome, what can <unk> and the discovery of new <unk>.
Now we're <unk> a new <unk>, and we started <unk> biology and now starting from that digital code we're <unk> in a new <unk> of biology, <unk> and <unk> life.
We always tried to <unk> great questions.
"<unk> is the life?" It's something that many <unk>, I think they have to understand different levels.
We tried different <unk>, <unk> to <unk> terms.
We're <unk> by 20 years.
When we <unk> the human genome <unk> to <unk> the human <unk> in the digital world of the digital computer biology.
Now, we <unk> us: we can <unk> life, or create new life from this digital universe?
This is the map of a small <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, which is the <unk> species from the <unk> genome in the lab.
And we tried to reduce the genome to <unk> one even smaller.
We're able to <unk> a <unk> of genes of about 500 that are here.
But when you look at its map, it's <unk> simple than our.
<unk>, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can <unk>, one at the time, it's very <unk> that this can bring to a <unk> cell.
So, we thought that the only way to <unk> was <unk> this <unk> <unk> to <unk> some of these questions.
And so we started the <unk> of the "We can <unk> a <unk>?"
Can the chemistry <unk> of these great molecules that we never have been able to create before we have?
And, in case we can make a <unk>?
A <unk> is just a <unk> of <unk> material.
The speed that we're able to <unk> life is <unk> to <unk>.
Our <unk> <unk> code, rather slowly, but it's <unk>, rather slowly, but it's <unk>.
And our <unk> results, the most <unk> <unk> are <unk>.
We <unk> over 15 years ago.
The process has <unk> a lot of <unk>, <unk> with a <unk> before we <unk> the early experiments.
But we found that <unk> DNA is very hard.
There are <unk> of thousands of cars in the world that <unk> little <unk> of DNA, <unk> <unk> <unk>, and it's a <unk> process: the <unk> is long <unk>, <unk>. The <unk> is over, <unk>.
So we had to develop a new <unk> to <unk> these <unk> and <unk>.
And this was our first <unk>, <unk> <unk> information <unk>.
It's a small virus that <unk> bacteria.
We designed the <unk>, we <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> a DNA <unk> of about <unk> <unk>.
The interesting part is when we took this piece of <unk> material and we <unk> it in bacteria, bacteria have <unk> to read this code and <unk> the <unk> particles.
<unk> particles are <unk> by cells, they're <unk> by cells, they're <unk> back and they have <unk>.
I talked about with the <unk> <unk> <unk> that they have certainly <unk> this model.
They have more of you.
And it's a situation that software can actually build the same <unk> in a <unk> system.
But we could make the biggest things in great.
We had to build the whole <unk> of <unk>.
They're more <unk> <unk> <unk> code.
So we thought of <unk> in the size of the virus, so we can change the <unk> to understand what the <unk> are <unk>.
<unk> is <unk>, and if you <unk> information <unk> in a computer, these must be very <unk>.
When I <unk> this genome for the first time in <unk> the <unk> was of a <unk> for every 10 <unk> <unk>.
We found, <unk>, 30 <unk>. If we were used that original sequence, you could never be able to do that.
A part of the process is design <unk> 50 <unk> that <unk> with all the other <unk> of 50 <unk> to build smaller than <unk> together.
<unk> elements here.
You probably read that <unk> us in the <unk>.
<unk> <unk>: We have a <unk> code on four <unk>: <unk>, <unk>, <unk> and <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> of those <unk> <unk> together, <unk> about 20 <unk>, and there's a <unk> order to <unk>.
So we can use the code for <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
What we did at the beginning was <unk>.
Some of them were <unk> by the fact that it wasn't <unk>.
We designed these <unk> to <unk> simply <unk> with <unk>.
There are <unk> that <unk> them and <unk> them.
And we started <unk> <unk>. And we started <unk> with <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to them.
But anyway, we have produced these <unk> in <unk> so that we're <unk> to create a very <unk> <unk>, as you'll see in a minute.
We're trying to <unk> the process.
So, this seems to be the <unk> of a <unk>.
When you start these <unk> very <unk>, more than 100 <unk>, they don't get <unk> directly in the <unk> <unk>.
It's <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> biology.
So we <unk> other <unk>.
<unk> of another <unk> called <unk> <unk>, which in biology <unk> to <unk> the DNA in order to <unk> the DNA.
Here's an example.
This <unk>, called <unk> <unk>, can <unk> three million <unk>.
You can see in the <unk> as his <unk> <unk>.
In 12 -- 24 hours, it's <unk> exactly like it was before.
<unk> thousands of organisms that are able to do that.
These organisms can <unk> completely <unk>.
We're going to live under <unk>.
They're absolutely sure that life <unk> in space, and you get <unk> to find new <unk> of water.
Actually, NASA showed that this is.
This is a picture of the <unk> that we built using these <unk>, just using the <unk> <unk> design of <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This is not been <unk> with a <unk> <unk>, but with a <unk> <unk>.
It's a <unk> so big that we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk>.
These are pictures that <unk> a period of about six seconds.
This is the <unk> we've done a little time ago.
They're more <unk> <unk> code.
It's the biggest <unk> of a <unk> structure ever <unk> by man.
It has a <unk> weight at 300 million.
If you <unk> it with a 10 without <unk>, you will only <unk> pages to <unk> this code.
Now, how do we do it? How can we <unk> it?
<unk>, through a virus is a <unk> game.
It's a little bit more <unk> when you're using bacteria.
It's easier when it's about cells as well as our: you can just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> another, which is almost the process of <unk>.
In <unk>, we <unk> the <unk> is instead of <unk> into the cell, but we <unk> <unk> that we are able to make a <unk> <unk> of a <unk> <unk> from a <unk> cell to another and <unk>.
We <unk> a <unk> <unk> from a species.
The two different things like <unk> men.
We <unk> some <unk> in a more way that you could decide what to do for this <unk>.
He's <unk> it with the <unk> so that we <unk> all the <unk>.
And when we put it in the cell was <unk> and <unk> our <unk> the new <unk> went into the cell.
And we had to say that we didn't go beyond, but we tried to <unk> more in there.
This is one of the biggest <unk> of evolution.
We found that <unk> species have <unk> a second or a third <unk> from some of a <unk>, <unk> in a second thousands of new <unk> to that species.
So who think about evolution as a only <unk> at the time, which <unk> doesn't understand much of the biology.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> that was in the cell didn't <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> we <unk> it.
It's <unk>, and it's <unk> the other <unk> as <unk>, <unk>, and we <unk> with only the cell and the new <unk>.
It became blue because of the genes we <unk>.
And in a short <unk> of time, all the <unk> of a species are <unk>, and you're <unk> of all in a new species, <unk> on the new software that we <unk> in the cell.
All the <unk> are <unk>, and the <unk> are <unk>, and when you <unk> the code that we <unk>.
Now, this may look like <unk> <unk>, but we <unk> the software, we can change things in a pretty <unk>.
Now, I've already <unk> that here is not about <unk> -- but <unk> of progress -- but to go from three million years and a half million years and a half million years and a half million years and a half million years and a half million years of <unk> <unk> in which we <unk> new species on this process.
Why do that?
I think it's pretty <unk> when we think about our <unk>.
We're going to go from six billion and a half the next 40 years.
Right to give a example: I was born in <unk>.
Now there are three people on the planet to <unk> <unk>; in 40 years, there will be four.
We're <unk> problems now to find food, <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> for six billion people.
We're still <unk> to do that for nine billion.
<unk> <unk>.
That means 100 million <unk> a day.
When we try to find <unk> <unk>, or any kind of process to <unk>, it will be a huge challenge.
And we have to realize that all of CO2 from these materials that we <unk> in the atmosphere.
At day, I'm going to talk about <unk> <unk> in the world, we have a <unk> with about 20 million genes, and I like to think that are the <unk> <unk> for the future.
The <unk> industry only only a <unk> of <unk>, and think about how many different things are <unk> out.
Our <unk> here is <unk> data from reality and our imagination.
Now we have <unk>, thank you to these <unk> <unk>, to create what we call <unk> <unk>.
We can build a big robot that can produce a big robot that can produce a million <unk> a day.
Think about <unk> these 20 million genes or different or <unk>, and to <unk> the <unk> to produce <unk> or <unk>, and we can change, with a little team, and create more <unk> biology in the last 20 years of science.
And it's just a <unk> <unk>.
We can choose to <unk> <unk>, chemistry or <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
This is a <unk> of some software software that we're working on to be able to <unk> and design species.
Well, we don't know how to be.
We know exactly what their <unk> code.
Now we're <unk> on the <unk> generation.
You've seen that <unk> from the <unk> was a <unk> experiment.
We <unk> <unk> <unk> and third generation that we had enough enough from <unk> to <unk> <unk> as much as <unk> or different kinds of <unk>.
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the <unk> would be <unk> CO2 in matter before, so we're working for design cells that can reach this, and we think we can have the first <unk> <unk> <unk> in about 18 months.
<unk> light <unk> with CO2 is a <unk>, but in our <unk> <unk>, we found different <unk>.
This is a <unk> that we <unk> in <unk>.
<unk> in the deep ocean, about <unk> meters of <unk> water.
<unk> <unk> from CO2 using hydrogen <unk> as a source of energy.
We're trying to understand if we can <unk> CO2, that can easily be <unk> by <unk>, <unk> that CO2 in <unk>, to drive this process.
So, we think that we might be able to <unk> what the basic question is that what life is, we <unk> the <unk> of <unk> the whole <unk> industry.
<unk>. If you can't do that TED, where can't do that from TED, where you can't do it?
It's going to be a main source of energy.
<unk>, we're working for the same <unk> to create <unk>.
You've seen this year with flu, we're always back a year and with a dollar in less when it's about a dollar in less when it's about it.
I think what you can change building <unk> <unk>.
That's how the future might start to look like <unk>, now, the evolution of evolution, <unk> the evolution with bacteria <unk>, <unk>, and finally cells.
We're so much about the people.
Our purpose is to make a <unk> of living enough enough to <unk>. Thank you very much.
First of all, I'm going to show you, the <unk> possible, some <unk> work, of the new technology that we took the <unk> <unk> <unk>. It's <unk>.
It's a <unk> environment where you can <unk> is <unk> at local level that you can <unk> with a huge amount of data.
So here we're seeing <unk> pictures of <unk> with a kind of <unk> <unk> and <unk>, for a fast <unk>, <unk> the images like.
And it doesn't matter how big the amount of information that we see, how big these <unk> of information or images.
Most of them are common pictures, but this is a <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of the <unk>, and <unk> in the <unk> of 300 <unk>.
It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that <unk> the <unk> of a system like this is the number of <unk> on your screen in any moment. It's also a very <unk> architecture.
This is a whole book, example of data not images.
This is the <unk> <unk>. Every <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk>.
So, to <unk> that's just about the <unk> and not images, we can do something like that, to see that it's about a real <unk> of the text, not a picture.
It could be a little bit of a <unk> to read a book.
You don't <unk> it.
This is a more <unk> example. It's a more <unk> example.
Every image is the beginning of a <unk>.
And it really gives you the pleasure and the good experience of the <unk> version of a <unk> or a <unk>, which is for a <unk> kind of a <unk> <unk>.
We also did something with the corner of this particular number of the <unk>.
We created a <unk> <unk> <unk> much <unk> of what you use in a normal <unk>, and we <unk> it.
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk>, you can see here.
Or other models, or even the <unk> <unk>.
And this really <unk> some of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of space in the screen.
And we thought that <unk> to <unk> and other <unk> like that, and <unk>, not <unk> to be <unk>.
Of course, the <unk> is one of the most <unk> <unk> for this kind of technology.
And on this <unk>, I don't want to lose time, if not say we have <unk> to <unk> this field.
These are all the streets in the United States <unk> over a NASA picture.
So now we're going to do something else.
This is actually alive in the web; you can see it.
It's a project called <unk>, which <unk> two different technologies.
One is <unk> and the other is a very interesting research computer computer computer computer <unk>, a student of Washington, with the <unk> <unk> of Washington, with the help of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>. <unk>. <unk> <unk>.
And it's alive on the web, <unk> <unk>.
You can <unk> when we do this kind of <unk>, where we can go from a picture to the other and have this kind of experience to <unk>.
But the <unk> of the images here has actually a meaning.
The <unk> of <unk> computers have these images together, so that we <unk> to <unk> places that <unk> all <unk> <unk> out of the <unk> <unk> are <unk>. And so you see that there's a <unk> of <unk> <unk>, and these things are all <unk>.
I don't know if I've got time to show you some other environment.
There are much more <unk>.
I want to go directly to one of the <unk> of <unk> data and this <unk> from a <unk> <unk> that we've done for the first time, we're going to show you what <unk> is really the key to show you what technology is really the key behind this technology, the <unk>. And it's not so much <unk> <unk> that we have in the website.
We had to <unk> some of the <unk> and forth.
This is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> images. <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> and <unk> images of kinds of <unk> and <unk> images of <unk> and <unk> and <unk> images of kinds of <unk> and <unk> and <unk> images of the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> images of this model is discovered in this model.
So, they're all <unk> images and have been <unk> <unk> in this way.
And it's possible to be <unk> in this <unk> way.
You know, I would never think of <unk> to work for <unk>.
It's very <unk> <unk> this kind of <unk> here.
I think we're going to see that it's about a lot of different kinds of <unk>: those of the phones in this environment.
And if I can, I go to look at those <unk>.
A lot of them are <unk>, etc.
<unk> here is a series of pictures here -- <unk>.
This is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We can go from the <unk> to physics of this environment.
The <unk> point is we can do things with social environment. This is now <unk> data from the whole <unk> of how to <unk> the land, from the point of view and <unk> all that data together.
All those pictures become <unk> together, more than the <unk>.
You have a model of the entire land that <unk>.
Think about this as <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> on Earth.
It's something that <unk> in <unk> of the people who are <unk>, and the <unk> that we <unk> for the use.
Their pictures are <unk> with <unk> <unk> by other people.
If somebody comes to <unk> the idea of <unk> all these <unk>, my picture of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of all these data, and I can use it as a <unk> point to <unk> in that space, in that <unk>, in that <unk>, using the pictures of everybody else, and have a social experience and <unk>.
Of course, a <unk> of all that are very <unk> of every interesting <unk> of the land, <unk> not just <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk>, but from memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I realized? What your software <unk> us to do is that that in a certain point, in the next few years, all the pictures will be <unk> together?
<unk>: Yeah. What's doing is basically <unk>.
It's creating <unk>, if you want, between images.
And it's <unk> it on the <unk> of images.
And what's going to be very interesting if you think about <unk> information that many of these images.
As you do a research of images on the web, you <unk> a <unk> and the <unk> on the web page has a lot of information about the pictures of pictures.
Now, what happens if that picture <unk> all your picture?
So, the amount of <unk> <unk> and the amount of <unk> that <unk> is really huge. It's a <unk> <unk>.
CA: <unk>, it's really incredible. <unk>.
<unk>: I'm going to <unk> you.
One of the main <unk> when you <unk> and one of the <unk> research is that that we can live in who has no <unk> <unk>, in the wind <unk>, in the <unk> <unk>, and we <unk> it in the <unk> of the <unk>, we <unk> it in the <unk> of the <unk> of the plants.
You might think that the <unk> <unk> still beyond the <unk> <unk>, or that the <unk> of <unk> are still <unk> <unk>, or <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk>, or <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk>, to remember the <unk> <unk>, and that the idea that the <unk> of <unk>, and that the idea that the world where we don't live in a sense, but it's just a <unk> of a model, but it's really a model,
And the <unk> of a particular <unk> of <unk> choices that our <unk> has done, or bad, many <unk>, many <unk> does.
And, of course, all of the <unk> <unk>.
Everybody <unk>. <unk>.
We're <unk> to <unk>.
We need to <unk> the <unk> of death, so we don't <unk> if you <unk> and <unk> --
We all have a art.
What <unk> is the <unk> <unk> of the song, the <unk> of every culture.
It doesn't matter that it's the <unk> of the <unk>, or the <unk> of <unk>, or <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk>, the <unk> of <unk>, or a <unk> in the <unk> of <unk>.
He was my <unk> of journey in <unk> a month ago, or a <unk> of <unk> in the <unk>, the <unk>'s mother of the world.
All of these <unk> us that there are other ways of <unk> other ways of thinking, other ways of thinking, other ways of moving in the world.
And if you take a second, it's a concept that can give you hope.
<unk>, the <unk> of <unk> of the world create a <unk> of life and <unk> that <unk> the planet and is important for the <unk> of the planet, as the <unk> <unk> as <unk>.
And you can think of this <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and you can <unk> the <unk> of all the <unk>, <unk>, dreams, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>,
The <unk> is the fantastic <unk> of humanity.
It's the <unk> of what we are and what we can be as as <unk> species.
And <unk> the <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> has been <unk> to <unk> and <unk> much <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, for example, <unk> that 50 percent of all the species has been or is on the <unk> of <unk>, because it's <unk>, or <unk> -- in the <unk> of the <unk> diversity -- and you don't even <unk> to <unk> <unk> -- that <unk> diversity.
The <unk> of that is, of course, the <unk> <unk>.
When you're <unk> <unk> <unk> on this planet.
A <unk> is not just <unk> by a <unk> or a <unk> of rules.
A <unk> is the <unk> of the human spirit.
It's the middle of which the <unk> of every culture comes in the material.
Every <unk> language is a forest of mind, a <unk>, a <unk>, a <unk> of <unk>.
And of those <unk> <unk>, as we are here in <unk>, at least half the <unk> is not <unk> in the <unk> of children.
They're not <unk> to children, which means, unless you know something, which is that they're already dead.
What's more <unk> than being <unk> by the <unk>, to be the last to talk about a language, and not <unk> the <unk> of <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of the kids?
This <unk> <unk> has been the one of the world of every two weeks: every two weeks: every two weeks, a <unk> <unk> and <unk> it <unk> with the <unk> <unk> of a <unk> language.
And I know that somebody of you <unk> "not better?
The world't be a better place if we <unk> all the same language? "<unk>, then we all talk about it. <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>.
<unk> of a <unk> thing means that, we can't talk their language.
Today I'd like to make a journey through the <unk> --
a small journey in the <unk> to give you a <unk> of what we're <unk>.
And many of us, I think, "different ways of <unk>," I mean, "I really mean different ways of <unk>.
<unk> for example, this <unk> <unk>, in <unk> <unk>, the <unk> of <unk>, which <unk> to the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's a <unk> that's not able to <unk> the blue color from the green because the <unk> time is <unk> in the forest, where the forest is <unk>.
They have a <unk> language and a <unk> rule, <unk> ": you have to <unk> a person who's <unk> a different language.
All of that has <unk> in the <unk>, but the <unk> is that in these families in which they talk six or seven <unk> because of the <unk> <unk>.
You're going to hear and then you talk to.
And I <unk> one of the most interesting <unk> that I lived, the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, an incredible <unk> that had the first <unk> in <unk>.
In <unk> five <unk>, they <unk> a <unk> <unk>.
They've made by the high pictures that <unk> them in <unk> that <unk> <unk>, <unk> that this <unk> of the <unk> forest, <unk> that <unk> <unk> forest had never seen anything.
They <unk> the pictures from the land, they <unk> to <unk> a form or a <unk> and, they don't have <unk>, they <unk> that <unk> <unk>, and they <unk> the five <unk> with <unk>.
But the <unk> didn't just <unk> the <unk>.
They <unk> between them.
<unk> percent of the <unk> was <unk> by their own own.
We started eight <unk> and we found two cases and found two <unk> of death and when we <unk> to know, they have <unk> that one of them was so that he died, and then they <unk> it. And then they <unk> it. And then they <unk> it.
<unk> were able to recognize the animal <unk> from 40 <unk> and <unk> the species.
<unk> years early, I was <unk>, I <unk> a very interesting task when my <unk> <unk> <unk> me if I wanted to go to <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> and <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk>
For a sense of <unk>, I should have understand the <unk> culture and that the <unk> is not <unk>.
It's pretty pretty much about a <unk> view of the world.
Very interesting.
If you <unk> the great <unk> of the world, what do I <unk>?
<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, etc.
A lot of the continent comes out, thinking, that Africa doesn't have <unk> <unk>. And instead and the <unk> is not the other than the <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk>.
What makes interesting is the <unk> relationship between life and death.
So, <unk> are <unk>.
<unk> can be <unk> by the <unk> <unk>, <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk>, so that for a little bit of the <unk> becomes the <unk>.
So, the <unk> <unk>, "<unk> <unk>, you go to <unk> to <unk> God.
We <unk> in <unk> and <unk> God. "
And from the moment that you are <unk>, is the spirit that you can <unk> you, how do you <unk>?
So, you <unk> to these incredible events: <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a pretty strong <unk> of the power of the mind when it's <unk> in a state of <unk> <unk>.
And I <unk> all the <unk> that I lived the most <unk> are the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, in the <unk> <unk>.
<unk> of the <unk> civilization that once <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk>.
In a <unk> continent of blood, this <unk> never been <unk> by <unk>.
<unk> today are <unk> by a <unk>, but their education is extraordinary.
<unk> <unk> are <unk> away from families to three or four years, and they live in a <unk> <unk> and <unk> in a <unk> world in <unk> and <unk> <unk> in <unk> for 18 years.
Two years of nine years <unk> about <unk> the nine months of <unk> that <unk> in the <unk> of the mother, now are <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>.
For all this time, they're <unk> to their society, values that their <unk> and just their <unk> and only their <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or to say the <unk> <unk>.
And at this incredible <unk>, they're <unk> out and for the first time in their life, at the age of 18, they see a <unk>. And in that moment of <unk> <unk>, when the sun <unk> <unk>, when the sun <unk> <unk>, all of the <unk> <unk>, all that they have learned in its <unk>. The <unk> does a <unk> <unk> <unk>. The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. The <unk> does a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
"<unk>? I'm going to tell you.
It's <unk>. Now it's going to <unk>.
They call <unk> <unk> and <unk> that we, <unk> <unk>, we are the <unk> of the world.
This is extremely important.
When we think of <unk> <unk> and the <unk> environment and the old <unk> <unk>, which is a <unk> in his <unk> or maybe <unk> <unk> and <unk> and say that these are <unk> <unk> to the Earth.
<unk> <unk> are not <unk> or <unk> by <unk>.
There's no space for these things in the <unk> of <unk> or <unk> <unk>, but because of the time and <unk>, they have created a <unk> of the Earth <unk> <unk>. It's <unk> <unk>. It's not about the <unk> of <unk> <unk>. But the Earth can be only because it's <unk> by human <unk>.
What does it mean?
And you say that a <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> that the mountain is a <unk> that <unk> is going to be a human being <unk> different and will have a very different human being. And it will have a very different human being. And it will be a <unk> <unk> to be <unk>.
which is a <unk> of a spirit or a <unk> <unk> is <unk>.
What's interesting is the <unk> that <unk> the relationship between <unk> and the natural world.
I grew up in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> that the <unk> to be <unk>.
And that has made me a human being different from my friends who believe that <unk> are the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> that live in the <unk> <unk> and <unk> that live in the <unk> <unk>, and <unk> that <unk> in the <unk> <unk>.
If we started to <unk> that these <unk> can create different, we start to understand some of them <unk>.
I <unk> this picture in <unk> in the <unk> <unk>.
Maybe some of you have heard about <unk>, the most powerful <unk> of the <unk> <unk>.
What makes the <unk> is not the potential <unk>, but its <unk>. It's <unk> by two elements.
On one side, this <unk> <unk> that has a series of <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, <unk>.
<unk> the only <unk> <unk> <unk>. It's <unk> that <unk> a little bit, but it's <unk> with the <unk> of a <unk> <unk>'s family <unk>.
This <unk> <unk> <unk>, very similar to the <unk>, <unk>.
If you're going to see the <unk> <unk>, <unk> that make a different <unk> of species, <unk> it <unk>.
<unk> that <unk> on the <unk> is a little bit like being <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a sea of electricity. [<unk>] [<unk>].] [<unk>] [<unk>] of reality. It doesn't make a <unk> of reality.
And I was often with my <unk>, Richard <unk>, the man who <unk> the <unk> was <unk>, with his discovery of <unk> in the <unk>.
My <unk> <unk>, you can't <unk> these <unk> as <unk>, because if you're done, you can't tell anybody to be <unk>. <unk>, but they can't be <unk> because they're <unk> by a <unk> that's <unk>, <unk>.
It's possible to be <unk> if you <unk> with other <unk> <unk> that <unk>.
Now, the <unk> that are in this <unk> are <unk>, of the same kind of <unk>, the same kind of necessary to <unk> the <unk>. The question is <unk> <unk>: in a <unk> of <unk> species of plants, as these <unk> to <unk> two <unk>.
We use the great <unk> of <unk> and <unk>, which can <unk>.
But if you look at the <unk>, we <unk> "plants are talking about."
What does it mean?
This <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, which <unk> <unk> in the forest, and our <unk> eyes in the same species.
If you <unk> them as they <unk> their <unk>, "<unk>" <unk> "<unk>" <unk> "<unk>" <unk> "<unk>" No.
The solution is: you take the <unk> <unk> in a night of the moon and <unk> with a different <unk>.
With this, you don't <unk> to <unk>, but it's much more interesting than <unk>.
Now, [<unk>] the problem is that even those of us who have <unk> <unk> them, but somehow <unk> to some <unk> of the history of the <unk> of the history of the real world than our real world, and it's going to be <unk>.
In fact, the <unk> century, in 300 years, not <unk> <unk> for its <unk> or his <unk>, but rather how it was that we <unk> and <unk> <unk>, but rather how the <unk> was that we <unk> and <unk> the <unk> of the planet. Now the problem is not the change.
All the <unk> are <unk> in a <unk> for new possibilities of life.
And the problem is not technology.
<unk> have no <unk> to be <unk> when they have <unk>, and <unk> as well as the <unk> have <unk>, and they have <unk> <unk>, and they have <unk>.
It's not the change or technology that <unk> the <unk>. It's the power.
The <unk> <unk> of <unk>.
And if you look at the world, you know, you know, they're not <unk> to <unk>.
They're <unk> and <unk> <unk> out of the existence of <unk> forces that are <unk> in their <unk> <unk>.
<unk> that <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> --
a <unk> <unk> of <unk>, in <unk> <unk>, a <unk> that has been <unk> in the forest to a generation ago, and now <unk> to the <unk> and <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk>, where you can see the <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk>,
We started <unk> with the <unk> <unk> to the forest.
Or, in the case of <unk>, are the diseases that are <unk> with the discovery of <unk>.
If you <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk>, where I'm doing a lot of research, you'll see the <unk> of the political <unk>.
As the <unk>, the <unk> of a <unk>, is <unk> at <unk> level, but the <unk>, the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk>, not just is not <unk>, but <unk> <unk> in certain <unk>, because it's a part of <unk> development.
And you can't understand the <unk> of the <unk> until you don't part of the beginning.
I've got the <unk> miles from <unk> in the <unk> China through the <unk> <unk>, <unk> with a young <unk>, but just come to <unk>, I realized what's going on on.
<unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> million people <unk> from the <unk> in the <unk>.
The father of this guy was <unk> to the <unk> <unk>.
which means that it's been <unk> to the <unk> of Chinese <unk>.
<unk> <unk> is <unk> with <unk> <unk> in the <unk> that has taken the <unk> in <unk>.
My mother was <unk> and his <unk> was being <unk>.
It was brought to <unk> in <unk> at age two years, <unk> <unk> his <unk> because she couldn't have no <unk>.
The <unk>, who did the same, was <unk> in <unk>.
A day <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>, for this <unk>, was <unk> to the work for seven years.
<unk> <unk> can be <unk>, but the <unk> <unk> <unk> is <unk> by <unk> present.
And finally, everything <unk> up with a choice.
Do you live in the <unk> world, or we want to <unk> the <unk> of diversity of diversity?
The great <unk> <unk> <unk>, before she died, before she died, his greatest fear was that, in our <unk> to this <unk> view of the world, not only <unk> the whole <unk> of human imagination to a <unk> <unk> of thinking, but a day we <unk> us from a <unk> <unk> that there were other possibilities.
And it's <unk> that our species is <unk> for <unk> years.
The <unk> <unk>, which has given us to us agriculture, which has <unk> us to <unk> the <unk> <unk>, <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> with the <unk> of <unk>, <unk>, creating the <unk> of <unk>, and we talk about <unk> years ago.
The <unk> world has <unk> 300 years.
That <unk> story, I didn't know, we have the answers to all the challenges that we could <unk> in the <unk> to come.
When these <unk> of <unk> the world is asked what it means to be human, <unk>, <unk> with different <unk>.
And it's in these answers that we all <unk> the possibility of being what we are: a <unk> species, that has to be a <unk>, that has to make that all the <unk> and all the <unk> can <unk>. And there are great moments of <unk>.
I <unk> this picture on the north of the <unk> island, when I went to <unk> <unk> with <unk>, and this man, <unk>, and this man, <unk>, <unk> me the wonderful story of his <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> wasn't always <unk> with the <unk> <unk> and in the '<unk> to <unk> our <unk>, we <unk> them.
The <unk> of this man <unk> <unk>.
The family, <unk> for his life, <unk> away all the <unk>, and all his <unk>.
You know that <unk> don't <unk> the cold, <unk>.
The <unk> of <unk> <unk> were made of fish <unk> in the <unk>.
The <unk> of this man didn't <unk> by night or <unk> <unk>.
It's <unk> away, you <unk> the <unk> in your <unk> <unk> and <unk> in your hand. When I did it <unk>, he <unk> it, he's <unk> by <unk>, he <unk> it <unk>.
He <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk> of <unk> and when <unk> <unk>, <unk> a dog.
He <unk> the dog and created a <unk>, with the <unk> <unk> created a <unk>, has <unk> another dog and <unk> on the <unk>, <unk> <unk> in <unk>.
<unk> to talk about anything? [<unk>] And this, in different ways, [<unk>] is the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all the <unk> <unk> of the world.
<unk> <unk> the government <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of a <unk> area of an area of <unk> <unk>, and <unk> together.
It's their new <unk>. It's called <unk>.
It's a <unk> <unk>. We <unk> all the <unk> resources.
One <unk> example of how a <unk> can <unk> with its <unk>.
And, to end, I think it's pretty <unk> at least at least at least at the <unk> of the planet, we realize that they don't have all <unk> at all.
For somebody's home.
<unk> <unk> of human imagination that <unk> at the <unk> of the <unk>. And for us all, the dreams of these children, like our children, they become part of the <unk> of hope.
For us, we <unk> <unk>, we're <unk> that <unk> are not going to be at all.
<unk> that <unk> --
<unk> <unk> are not <unk>, but we believe that stories can change the world, and maybe we're the best <unk> to tell the stories of the world. Every month our <unk> <unk> <unk> million <unk>.
<unk> <unk> our <unk> <unk>.
Our <unk> are <unk> by millions of people.
Our work is <unk> in <unk> to bring our public in places to <unk> our public places that <unk> away from how they have seen and, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, time for the <unk> of <unk> <unk>, and we have to find a <unk> of life in diversity, and we have to find a <unk> <unk> and <unk>.
where we <unk> of all the <unk> can <unk> our <unk>.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope that you've already heard and <unk> some <unk>, in case, I don't <unk> them.
I'd like to start with what I call "the <unk> <unk>."
<unk> <unk> of what?
The <unk> of all the society <unk> <unk>. The <unk> <unk> <unk>: "If we want to <unk> the <unk> of our citizens." The way to do it is <unk> the freedom to do it is <unk> the freedom. "
The reason is, on a side, in fact that the freedom is <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> for humans.
<unk> else is in fact that if we are <unk>, each of us can act for doing everything that we <unk> our <unk>, without nobody that we <unk> our own own own.
The way to <unk> the freedom is to <unk>.
And the people have, more choices are, and more and more and more and it's their freedom,
This is, <unk>, it's so <unk> <unk> in society that nobody <unk> in <unk>.
And it's also <unk> <unk> in our lives.
I'm going to show you some examples of what progress has been possible.
This is my <unk>. It's not very big.
I <unk> a simple note on the <unk> to <unk>.
In my <unk>, there's <unk>, <unk>, without <unk> the 10 <unk> of <unk> and the 12 <unk> that you can buy a huge <unk> number of <unk> in the <unk> that nobody of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> that nobody's already <unk>.
That's what <unk> is like.
Then you go to the store <unk> to buy a <unk>: <unk>, <unk>, radio, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
And in this single store, there's a big number of <unk> <unk>.
We can make six million and a half million different <unk> using the <unk> that there are in a only store.
<unk> <unk> that there is <unk> choice.
<unk> <unk>: the world of <unk>.
Once, when I was a child, you could get all the <unk> services, <unk> that were <unk> by <unk> <unk>.
It's <unk> the phone, not <unk> it.
And one <unk> of that, in the other, was that the phone never <unk>.
These days, they went.
We have a <unk> almost <unk> of <unk>, especially between the phones.
Here's the cell phones.
My <unk> is in the middle, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, and <unk> for <unk> <unk>.
If you don't have yet seen in the store under your house, you're very soon <unk>.
And what is going on on the end is that people <unk> and <unk> this question. And you know, what is the answer? The answer is "No.
It's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn't make things.
So, in other <unk> of life that are much more important than <unk>, <unk>, <unk> the same <unk> of choices.
<unk> <unk>: It doesn't happen in the United States that you're <unk> from the <unk> and the <unk> you what you have to do.
Instead, <unk> from the <unk>, and the <unk> says, "OK, we could do it, or <unk>" <unk> "<unk>" has these <unk> and <unk>. "He's got these <unk> and <unk> these <unk>. What do you want to do?"
You <unk> him: "<unk>, what do you want?"
And the <unk> says, "<unk> has these <unk> and these <unk>, and <unk> has these <unk> and these <unk>."
"What do you want to do?"
And you say, "<unk> if she was, what would you say?"
And the <unk>: "But I'm not she's."
The <unk> we call it "<unk> <unk>", "<unk>", "<unk>" <unk> "," <unk> that makes it look like a good thing.
But actually, it's not that a <unk> the weight and responsibility to make decisions from someone who knows something, <unk> the <unk>, to <unk> the other we don't know -- and it's certainly not about -- and so much of course, and so we don't know -- and so we don't have to <unk> <unk>.
There's a huge <unk> of <unk>, <unk> to people like me and you, that if you think about it doesn't <unk> any sense, because we can't <unk>.
But if we can't <unk>, why do we <unk> them?
The answer is they want to <unk> what we call the <unk> to <unk> the <unk>.
And we're going to be so important as it's our <unk>. It's about choice, how you see in this <unk>. "We don't want to <unk> kids. We don't want to <unk> the children." We need to <unk>.
And we can <unk> how many times we <unk>.
which means that every <unk>, you have to decide that kind of person.
<unk> to the family and <unk>, a <unk> time, and a common perspective, <unk>, <unk> almost to everybody, and it was <unk> to be as possible, and they had to get the <unk> as possible.
The only real choice was with who, not when, and even what to do after.
<unk>, it's really to play.
They're going to very smart, and they <unk> their 20 percent less than a time.
And not because they're <unk>, not because they're less <unk>.
But why are they <unk>, <unk> to <unk>, "<unk> <unk> or not? <unk> it?"
"<unk> <unk> <unk> later? I have to think before kids or <unk>?"
I'm <unk> <unk>.
And they try to answer these questions, even if this <unk> doesn't <unk> the <unk> that <unk> and <unk> and not get a <unk> <unk> to my <unk>.
And they have to do that. They're important questions.
Now, the work: we're <unk>, as <unk> <unk>, because technology allows us to work every minute, every day, from every day, from every day the planet, we <unk> from <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, there's a <unk>, and I'm not going to say, what <unk> works.
I'm not saying, because I want to use it.
What does, this incredible freedom to choice that we have about work? It's we need to decide, <unk> in every moment, if we have to work or not.
We can go to see our son to play, with the <unk> in a <unk>, the other, and the <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
And even if I'm all <unk>, every minute we see our son, we're also <unk>, "I have to <unk> this called"? "
"I have to answer this <unk>? I have to <unk> this letter?"
And even when the answer is "no," all of this <unk> experience of your son very different from what would be in other conditions.
So, from any part of us, and big, and big, and <unk> materials and <unk>, life is a matter of choices.
Once the world was this: <unk>, there were some possibilities, but it wasn't all about choice.
The world of <unk> today is: "It's a <unk> thing, or <unk>?"
The answer is <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, we know, so I'm going to talk about <unk>.
<unk> this choice is <unk> two effects of people.
The first <unk>, <unk>, is that <unk> instead of <unk>.
With a lot of <unk> between which, it's very hard to do it.
I'll give you a <unk> example: a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
A <unk> <unk> <unk>, with a <unk> <unk>, <unk> society <unk>, with about a million <unk> <unk> in different companies.
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are <unk> in the <unk>, the <unk> of <unk> two percent.
With 50 <unk> <unk>, there's 10 percent less than <unk> <unk> in <unk> than <unk> when they are only five. Why?
Because with 50 <unk> between which you choose, is <unk> hard, and it's <unk> hard, and the choice is <unk>.
And <unk>, and again, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and of course, <unk>, and of course, <unk> will never get.
<unk> that doesn't mean that these <unk> <unk> food to <unk> because they don't have enough money, it also wants to say that the decision is so <unk> that we're also <unk> the decision of work.
They're not going to be <unk> to five <unk> <unk> for a year from <unk> <unk>, which would be <unk> to <unk>.
So, <unk> is a <unk> of having <unk> choices.
And I think we're going to <unk> the world.
"And finally, for <unk>: <unk>, <unk> or <unk>?"
You know, you know, if it's for <unk>, is it?
You don't want to choose the wrong, and you <unk> the wrong wrong.
So this is the first effect. The second is that if we can <unk> <unk> and make a choice, we're <unk> by the result of how we <unk> states with less <unk> between which you have been <unk> with less <unk>.
And this for several reasons.
One of these is that with a lot of <unk> between which, if you <unk> a <unk> and it's not perfect, it's easy to imagine that that could make a different choice that would be better. And what happens is that the <unk> <unk> <unk> us to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from the decision, and the <unk> <unk> <unk> from the decision, and the <unk> <unk>,
And when it was a <unk> decision.
And the more choices there are, easier to <unk> of any <unk> that is <unk> of <unk>.
<unk>, there's what <unk> call.
Dan <unk> has <unk> very well as the value that we give things to things that we give things from what we <unk>.
<unk>, when there are a lot of <unk>, it's easy to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and <unk> of the <unk> that you have choice.
Here's an example. I <unk> with all the people who are not New York.
But that's probably <unk>.
There's this <unk> to the <unk>.
A <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>. <unk> day. It's all for them.
It doesn't <unk>. But what he thinks is, "Well, <unk>, <unk>, it's <unk>."
"All my <unk> <unk> are away."
"<unk> <unk> <unk> in front of home."
And it goes back two weeks from the idea that's <unk> -- every day -- the <unk> of <unk> where it wants.
The <unk> <unk> for what we have, even when the choice was <unk>.
And the <unk> we have <unk>, the <unk> that we have <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Here's another example.
This <unk> tells us a lot of things.
It's about the living moment, and maybe a living slowly.
But the most important point is that you will <unk>, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you're not going to do other.
The things that don't <unk> have a lot of <unk> that can make less <unk> what we do.
<unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk>.
I tried it on my skin <unk> a new <unk>.
It's almost always <unk>.
Once the <unk> were just like, <unk> them and <unk>, they were <unk>, only after <unk> <unk>, and they were <unk>, just after <unk> a lot of times, they were going to go well.
So, I started to <unk> a new <unk> when the <unk> were gone, and I said, "I need a couple of <unk>, this is my <unk>."
The <unk> said, "Do them want to <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>?"
Do you want them to <unk> or with <unk>? "
"Do them want them to <unk>?"
"<unk> <unk> them, or <unk>? <unk> <unk> <unk> --" <unk> to <unk>.
I was <unk>, and after a little bit, and after a little bit, and I was <unk>, "I want the only guy." I want the only guy to me, "I <unk> all of the <unk> <unk>, then <unk>, and then <unk> from the <unk>, <unk>, and then I was <unk> <unk>.
It was the <unk>. With all that choice I had <unk> the best.
But I'm going to get worse.
Why? I wrote a whole book to <unk>.
The reason I was worse is that with all that choice my <unk> were <unk>, the <unk> <unk>.
And I had <unk> <unk>. I didn't know anything about <unk> when I was just a kind of <unk>, but when we <unk> 100 different, at least one kind had to be perfect.
What I had <unk> was good, but not perfect.
After I <unk> that I <unk> with what I was <unk> in <unk>.
The <unk> of <unk> in life of people don't make <unk> that these <unk> are <unk>.
And that <unk> less <unk>, even when the results are good.
<unk> in the <unk> world, if you realize it.
Because if you <unk> it, I don't know what I'm talking about.
The truth <unk> to this.
"It was better when you was worse," The reason why you were <unk> when you was worse, it was that when it was worse as much as you could <unk> <unk>.
<unk>, in the world we live in -- <unk> citizens with the <unk> of the <unk> -- the <unk> that we can <unk> is that things are at the <unk> of the <unk>.
You've never <unk> to <unk> because your <unk>, my <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
The <unk> of happiness -- what you're here -- is, "<unk> <unk>" Yes, you want it. "
I mean -- small moment, little <unk> moment -- that I'm really <unk> and my wife is <unk>.
I couldn't do better, I didn't have <unk>.
But <unk>, it's not a <unk> thing.
<unk>, a <unk> of a <unk> <unk> <unk> when you have a couple of <unk> <unk> is that when you're not <unk>, and you say, "Why?"
"Who is <unk>?" The answer is <unk>.
The world is the <unk>. What could I do?
When you have hundreds of <unk>, and you <unk> a <unk>, and you'll <unk> a <unk>, and you will <unk> you who is the <unk>, it's <unk> that the <unk> you are.
And they could do better.
With hundreds of <unk>, there are no <unk> for <unk>.
So when people are taking decisions, even if the result is <unk>, they <unk> and give them their own <unk>.
In the last few years, the <unk> is <unk> in the <unk> world.
I think a <unk> <unk> -- not the only, but important -- of this <unk> of <unk> is that people have <unk> experiences because the <unk> are too <unk>.
And when they have to <unk> this situation think that <unk> is them.
So the final result is that in general, we're better, <unk>, but we <unk>.
<unk> that you will.
This is the <unk> <unk>, what we all take for good and it's completely <unk>. It's not true.
There's no <unk> that a little choice is better than <unk>, but it doesn't have much much better than all, but that doesn't <unk> that much choice.
There's a <unk> value, <unk>. I don't know what it is.
But I'm sure we've been <unk> by a piece of the level where the choices are <unk> our life.
Now, from the point of view, <unk> -- I've been <unk> -- from the point of view, the <unk> is the <unk>.
What allows all this choice in the <unk> society is the <unk> material.
There are many places in the world, and you have <unk>, where the problem is not that they have <unk>.
The problem is that they have too <unk>.
So, the <unk> that I'm talking about is a <unk> of <unk>, <unk> society.
And what <unk> <unk> and <unk> is this: <unk> <unk> <unk> you talked about yesterday about how those <unk> and <unk> to <unk> are <unk>. It's a <unk> of money.
I mean that these choices, <unk> and <unk>, it's not that simply <unk>.
I'm <unk> <unk>.
They do worse.
If a little bit of what our society allows us to be <unk> in those where people have too few possibilities, it wouldn't be their life to be better, but our own.
This is what <unk> call a <unk> <unk>.
A <unk> of the income <unk>, not only to the poor -- not only to the poor -- because of this choice in <unk> that <unk> us.
And to <unk>: "<unk>, you can become everything you want to --
<unk>, people of culture, <unk>, "But what do that fish?"
"It's <unk> that you can't make anything in a <unk> of glass."
"A <unk> <unk>, a <unk> <unk> <unk>."
and I <unk> it so, at the beginning.
But then, <unk>, instead, I realized that that fish knows that that fish knows the long time.
Because the reality of the fact that if you <unk> the <unk>, so that you can't <unk> the freedom. You can't <unk> the freedom. It <unk> the <unk>.
If you <unk> the <unk> so that you could <unk> the <unk>.
<unk> the <unk>, and <unk> <unk>.
Everybody needs a <unk>.
This is almost certainly too <unk>, maybe even for the fish, and certainly for us.
But the <unk> of some <unk> <unk> is a <unk> for <unk> and, for <unk>.
Thank you.
