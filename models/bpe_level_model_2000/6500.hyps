The oil is a problem, and the carbon is persse.
The United States are one of the most of the patient with the Cina.
And it was a lot of other centrun of other centry.
But we're doing a change to change a change.
These are the projects in the last few years and some propositions, and some proposition.
Actually, there's a loty politics in our Paese.
The industries of the oil, they have been expect 250 million dollars in the last year to property the carbon the last year to propertic carbon --
And this picture rereceived me to anything,
I know Natan, in the Tennesses, where you live a perdition, where you live a perperdangerous of charbon.
Maybe you saw it seen the news of it.
This is the second of the most floorest in America.
It's happened to Natal.
The public public of the industries of the carbon was this was this.
Vide: I know the Frosty is a kind of a little bit of happiness.
It's a lot of here in America, and it does our economy.
Frosty carbon is always more population.
It's a good good pretty good enough to workers and works.

So our first priority is investing a big amount of money to a public public public to public public and confuses on the very,
In fact,
We think it's a good good proposed -- he also have a good proper.
So I don't predictately,
Let me do to do now.
Vide: All you know, I have to talk about a little bit of you to talk about a lot of it.
So we do a game, a structure of the structure of how to read the carbon to the carbon the carbon the carbon

The consumer of carbon is between the rescaling of the global reclude technology of the carbon the reality of the carbon the rest of the carbon the rest of the rest of the global rects.
You have a little bit of carbon the technology of carbon the carbon

A piece of the work, make it work, can make us more sure you can help the source of the global global global global global global global global global global global resident.
Finally, a solution that basts to our problems.
Repower America. Scouple of it.

Al Gor: A shot phones are says, "If you go to go to the money to go to the money to go from money to go to --
If you want to go to the tank."
We have to go to go to the top it.
Thank you very much.
The year to TED physical pointroduction on the LHC.
And they promise to make a lot of the works like to work on how works.
So the other thing about it. And for the other time I don't know that the other time was the largest experiment or never experiment -- 27 clears -- 27 ask of conference.
And his behind is rerecognize that were less than a billion of a billion second of the universe -- until of the universe of the second.
All of course is simply environment.
This is the Gineve.
We have these mini-Big Big Bang Big Big Bang Bang Bang Bang Big Big Bang Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big B.
This is what I work. It's called ATLATLA, is a hours and has a diamet.
This is a picture of ATLATLATLATLAS in building so you can realize that you can recognition.
The 10 settembasic scorors of the first time for the first time,
And this picture was a picture of ATLATLAS.
You know, it was a himmense of the healthy in the health.
It's a picture of the first particles of particles that was all the girl of the LHC, and he was in collision, and deliberated, with a part of the LHC, and hundroping the side of the LHC, and hondrop and the reevent.
In other words, when we have the picture of the picture of the picture of the machine, we understand the machine, which is a great life, which is a great life.
I don't know if it was to do more opening than anymore, when somebody go to Google and view up to Google and pay was this to pay was this to the pay of Goog.
It means that we had a impact cultural impact of what scientific scientific to what scientific scientific scientific amound.
And this is a week doctor, there was a problem with the machine, I had to these films here -- these films here -- these films.
These are 13,000 view when the machine is to the machine works in the powerful of powerful powerful machine.
Now, the technical of you look at the film, "I don't know the film, "I'm not true.
And instead of them because I am very quickly become codings of the sursurprising surfaces.
So, at 271 degrees, a perature of inference in the space, these movies can bring that the space, these films can bring that corrup.
In a of the most of the most emistry of the magnets in LHC, there was a diflops of folds.
So the movies of the rest of the read of the 13,000 ample of the 13,000 villion resistance of electric.
This was the result.
Now, this is more impression, if you think these magnets are more than 20 tones in the tones of 20 tons of about 30 centimeters.
They are done of about 50 magnet.
We had to be able to light, what we did we did it.
We have realized and travels.
And now are all the place of their own place to the place of their own place to the top of their own place to the ground.
Ennth of the marzo the LHC will be integry.
We have to get them to get to get to get to get the data of the data or or game, and continue to get so our wavaily to find how the universe.
Now, of course, in a certain a certain the mod, these drive ddrible disease on the value of the science of the science and the engineering to the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the science and the dright.
I think the fact that it was so difficult to go to the three limits, I think this is the value of things like LHC.
I want to tell you with the words of a scientists of English Instity, Humrey Davy, which is a defespecies of the inuses of the inuses of the inus, the hopen was a scientist, "Nish: "Nishshshshshort of human science to the human ideas that are the ideas that we have the mind of the ideas that we have a a new minds, which is that we have to be a new minds,
Thank you.
I want to start ask to do you to rethink about to go to the children to the couple of the batts.
And you know, you know, you know, you know, you get them and make them and make them and move them and mother, learning and reality and resolve problems and resolve problems and hands to be relationship and hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hands and and reality to make them and reality and reality and reality to be able to think and and reality to think and reality and and reality to think about the the sungers.
The reason is propertive space, which we understand that we understand that we understand the world of the world of the world of the world.
So, by inform of our interaction of our interaction with our interaction with the objects of the objects and my consult Pactic Jeevan Kalth, I started to ask the clear Kalth, and you know, when we have a computer, of the phast, and the clear of the phast, and the crashed with a redigital inform of the putting and the information of the information of the physical ploype of the re-fic fish,
and we are the pack of our plororder?
The question was so interesting question of exploring the answer to build the answer Siftable.
In the words, a Stor is a computer in the whole computer active as a piece of cool as a cococourage.
In the words, a Stor is a computer in the whole computer active as a piece of cool as a cococourage.
You can move with the hand, you can see you know, "see the sil, I heard the movie and they have a skpattern.
But I mean, I am am objects like the matter and mothers, you can just just just just just to simple and just just just just to be able to make it just just just to be able to move and move simple today.
The Stabought is the examples of a new ecool system to eat information information to information information to information information in the digital information of a new ecouraging information.
And the myself become more physical mother, the other place, of the other other places, and the other other places, and the other other people, and the other other other other people, like the other other others, like the other other other people, we can exploring new and different and different interaction.
I can instance,
This Stable is configurated to show the video video sources in a direction, the video o game, if you can get the other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other
These are the interacactive interact of other.
If you do them to interesting thing, you know, they do it.
If they have to be condata, and they can can make a poor.
If they have to be condata, and they can can make a poor.
They also have their movies and reviews and view line.
We are realized that one of the interesting of the interaction was the power of the interaction of the data, or "versation of the data, or "versation of the area of the area of the area of the way of the interaction of the interaction of the interaction.
In this case, we three Stiny as a sect-sect-sect of veral class of the color, where you can use them in the centry, where you know,
And I can use them to cut them to the hor, where you ask it.
If you have too much of it, we can put a little bit of it.
There are also beautiful and you can take them to be done of the language, the mathematics and yoes where people can try to try to make things things that people can see, and see the way of the way.
Now I'm --
This is a sequency of Fibonact that I do with a program of equations.
So we have a play play of the words is metaphalf and Bogg.
Procket, in the house of the lands of every Stable, Procratically, Procratically, Proom, and as a land as a ththrow of Stable, and as a hundreds of a dience.
And after about 30 second of the resimilar source and hand a new set of characters and new possible to try to try to propertive and new possible to do it.
Thank you.
Here's the children came to the Middy Lab, I did in the way I did it and I did a video.
They have a lot of it.
And one of the interesting things that is that is that not to tell you to you to people to tell you about people who are not to tell you about people in the many people who are not to tell you about the people who don't have to tell you about the people who are not to tell you to tell you about the people that is not to give you a lot of the people who are not to tell you that that is not to tell you that that that this kind of of the ironment.
You just know, "Well, the words, ""Well, they are words, and they have to do it.
That's how other people who are going to do it.
This is our bather, young more young than the road.
In fact,
They just just just a five money for it.
Now, this is an application of a cards.
We wanted to build a tools for the Eappears of Lui is Felix.
It can inserve new person, in the scend, solling the Stype of their associated ates.

It's a recently, realized to field and exeply and exeply to be music.
The SStable here is a based by the basic basic and the battery.
Ogn, one of these has four different variations, and you can get to use what us.
You can inolds, these inserve in a sequency sequences or packs.
And it difishing to make a "sequence, "sure a "sequence, and a sequence.
These are effects that can control from the live and the movie.
And I have to a particular places to get and then you get to to add it.
And then there are the general effects as time and I wanted to be applicate to intersequence.
We look like to work.
Vide: Do you put a base in two Shistory in two Shopen Shtype in a seriously, we have to other sit other base.
Now I was a basic line.
Vide: One of the only thing about the top of the use."
Vide: And then put the movie the movie, so I can control the effect of the effect of the effect of the view.
Vide: Do fast, I fast, you fast, and you get the whole sequence, or the other.
Vide: And then I will have the movie to the movie of the based to drop more expression.
Vide: Do you know, I would be instead of "I want to get the sequence.
So I don't like to planiz, but I can provide it to provising, and sending more or or more or more or more or or more or more than the moon.
And finally, I can get the whole sequence, I can save the whole sequences to save the strange Stype the Sty."
Thank you.
So, as you can see my passion is build new interface in the machine of the machines as a lot of the brain works.
And I have a time of the show you a results of the results of this person and also some of this person who we can try to get out of the laboratory of the laboratory.
The conct that I want to tell you is that is that it comes to this new generation of objects to interact with the media to interact with the media dedict of the media way that we want to be a way that we want to be a new way to be a new way that we want to do with this new generation of objects to inter
Thank you very much.
I don't know the way, I don't know about all you.
I'm a screen writ.
Scrisive is my profession, but it's more of this --
It's also the friends the friends of my life.
And I don't know that I can change it.
But at this time, something very particular is going to be recently in my life and in my car, and in my car, which he had to recently recently was a very well.
The particular thing I recently recently this book, this book, this book, this book, "Mana, Prea, Prea, Ama" the qual, for some thing, for some reason to be a very different, and he become a big crazation of interaction, and it was a big best,
And the result is that everybody else to the people are like if people are like if I was condence.
Davail, condence, condence --
They have to do me and tell me and tell me and said, "You don't know "You don't have to be able to do more than to do you can do you do with a lot of of the bong?
You don't have to be going to continue to go to to everything to be able to make a book that can create a book that can make somebody to make somebody to make somebody elelse to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do anyone to be able to be able to be able to writing to be able to writing somebody to be able to build a book that can be able to make a book that a book that can be able to do to make a book
which can you know somebody else you can you like to do you can you do you can you know anything that can you can be to somebody elelse
It's rask of all, you know,
But it could go to the worst of what I remember I think more than 20 years ago, when I started to say people -- I wanted to say -- I wanted to be a writice.
I met the same reaction of the patient.
And people say that said, "I don't know the time I don't have to have to have to have success?
You don't have a patient that the billion of the rifilling of the right.
You don't have to be to do this mestive to everything without the life without of the life that was going to be out and mulo of the mulo of the broke of the bands of the energy of the energy of local energy?"
So you know, you know,
The answer -- the answer is all these questions is "Y."
I have to be able to all of those things.
I always have a patient.
And I also have a lot of other things that people don't have to be inness to it.
As the other things are often other things of,
Ma, for how I was writing what I thought I was asked me and ask me to be a deal because it is because it is.
Is you know?
It's logical that I asked to be spect to be often to be often to be spread to do it.
But what is so particular that we have to make us to make us to make us to read the rest of the rest of the reality of the rest of other carrifi?
How do I mean, for example, he was a ingequipment and I don't recognited in the 40 years of a months that was asked to be a hands of the pativity to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a couple of a money to be able to be able to be able to ururt a months to be able to be a solve or or or or or or
There was that -- that they have that -- that you have to say, "Why do you know, you know, you know,
It didn't work?
Onestly, the engineers like group like group like group of course, in courage of course, in the couple of being alcourages of being alcouraged to be able to be alcourage in the couple of course,
We have a repution, we have this repution, and not only writers but not only writers of all generes, we have this reputation of being instabought to be instables of being instables of being inmention.
And not other is to look at the tristand context or deaths of the death of the magnize that in the wind of the windance, and often to the myself and often to the hor.
And that the people who don't have been data to be recording to be recording to their woms.
Norman Mailer, before the last month, in the last view of the interview, "Ogns my book me a point of the extraordinary extraordinary of the worst of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the words.
But we don't know when we heard when we have to say that we heard these things that are very much in a way we have been interiiors and accepted the nice and the soft that creative and the soffering and the art of the art and the art of scientist, and the art of scientist.
And the question I want to tell you all to everything is today is that you are with this ide?
It was the basic thing -- because it looks like a centimeter of distance to me not be a himeter for this supposed to be able to be a himeter of the himeter of the himet.
I think it's a diosa.
And I think it's also a lot of the perpetually in the next seas.
I think it's better unencourage our green creative creative creative to viver.
And so I know that in my case, in my home, in my house -- it would start to get to to be able to be able to figure that I was going to feel the expensive in the expensive in my car.
Of -- involved -- but look at a young young young years.
I still have about four decade in my work in my work in my work in my work in my work in my work in work.
And it's very probably probably anything that I writing up and then it will be going to be a world like the world as a work of the world as a writing of my last last last year.
It was going to be now, because we all are more friends here -- it's probably the most amount of successful is to midddle and spall.
Oh, Ges: Oh, you think about that.
You know this is the gence of thinking about a person to start to start to start to start to get to the battack and I don't want to do it.
I would continue to do this work that we love this work that we do.
So, the question of the question of the question?
And so I know that after a lot of reflect to work to continue to continue to continue to do a copsychological structures of protet, right?
I had to find a distance of sure reactive to me, and my natural job, and my natural was about what I was writing to the write E, as I was trying to do everything will be able to look at the time, trying to do it to look at the other people to look through the other species to see other society and I was going to have more and more than the way to have more ideas as as as as as as of the way to do and the most of the way to be able to do and the most of the the the human ideas of the react of the recorred, and and the human human human human human
like to help people creative to make people like to make the inerents of creativity.
And that research has been taking a and phons and Roma.
Seguitems because I was a hundred and then you go back to the hundred and then you go back to the hor.
No Grecic and Roma -- the people don't like -- people don't like to believe that the creative creativity to the manage, OK?
It was thinking about the creative was about this is about dive, and he was going to dive, and he was seen a few people who had a few people and connected to reach and connected connected and connected to reach the dive.
The gregrew of the demonis of the creative creativity
Socrates, I wonderful of course, it was to have a demon the ssand.
The Rome of the same idea, but they called the species without of a genie.
The thing is that the big dios, because the Romans I don't think a gene of intelligen, I was a very intelligen.
They have a gene of course was this kind of exity to live that you have to live in the history of a little bit like the study of a little bit like the eleck of the pho Dobby, and that was a little bit like the worst of the artist, and the work.
Exial -- that is the distance of which is the distance of which is the psychological structures that proteed by the way of the work.
And all the worth that was so that it works, right?
So the artists of certain the same thing, like for example, like for example, now?
If you have a working was an exceptional work was the markets, all the market, all of the market.
If your work with phalsl, it was not all the care of your right?
They know that they were the genie of being a inability.
And so people like a concept in Ocdent in Ocdent for a very time.
And then the Rinascient and change all of change, and we change this great idea; we have the great idea; we have the trum of the universe and even more and more than the mistery and even more than the growing of the details that they have to wrote from the divinity.
This was the principle of human eximplace and people start thinking about the ground of the ished creative to think that creative is from the ishshed.
And for the first time in story, you know, you get to this is a gene of this artist of the artist of a gene genie.
And I have to divel, I think was a big sket.
I think I think of them to be a simple of create create to be like a recip, as a recip, and the founds, and the founds, creative and inconnect to the misters, and inconnect a movie or a movie, and the phragible physical movie.
It's like to ask somebody elingoid the solve.
Deform and distory and create all these kinds of these expectable and the performance.
And I think this was this pression to the artists in the past of the past in the past of years.
And, if this is true, and I think that I think the question to be --
Can we do it different?
Many of human beginning to make more antic coming to human beings and creative the human beings and creative creatic relationship of human beings of the relationship of the relationship of human beings of human relationship.
Or maybe it is.
Maybe we can't cannot have to did 500 years of though I was a talk about 18 minutes.
And probably people who are the public public that would be easy to me the scientific of the non-di, involved by the data of the further of the further thing about their project to their project their project that they have a little bit of physical projects.
It probably not you know about all about this thing.
But the question I want to tell you -- because now?
Why don't think about this mother?
Because it more sense of any other thing that has ever ever ever heard to explaining the process of the process of the process of the creative process of creative process of the process of the creative process of the process.
A process that is that that you have ever ever ever you have to do something -- so mudamental -- you know, all here -- you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
And, you know, you know, can seems to be completely paranorm.
I did this instance, I was a poetimes with the same Ruth Stones, which was 90 years, but it was a poet, which was a poet, I was a poet, I was working in the Virginia, and I was working in the walking -- I was a brother, and I was a bespoet, and I was the patic of the extraordinary country and I was a patic of the extraordinary to the same thing for the same Rutterm.
I said, "I know that he was a basic of aria.
And that was going to get to the patient of the patient.
I heard to be to go to the land and he was to make the building.
It was a solve thing to have a solved thing to that point and he was di, "corr, "corring as a matta."
And it was to go to and get to the wind and it was to make this poesia, and not had to make another piece of cards and a piece of cards a mathem, as a wind of pay and the putting the purch, and he was the putting on the pine.
Some of three times you have to be enough to be enough and recorrecorree and recorres to get into the roten and the roted roten and the left and it was going to get through the patic pppack the patient, you know, the other poet, and he was going to go through the other poet.
Then there were the piece of -- this piece of -- there was never -- there was a moments that was a moment, and he was going to be almost perdriven --
So, he was recording to and he was trying to look at the cards and the past of the past and he was going to go through the wind and then he was going to go to the other and said, and then he was going to go and the other hand.
He was the poorth of the couff, and he was a hune and reality to the pine.
And in these stuff was the page of the pain the page of the pain and intact of the last word to the last word to the last word to the last word to the last word of the first word to the last word of the first pack of the first paperfect in the last word of the page of the pine.
So when you have to heard -- is exactly ex, it's exactly to my process of my creative creative process
I don't have my process -- I'm not a conduttly -- I'm not a condutututting it.
I'm a mule, and my way to work is to work is to work and I see it on the same orary and work and work and work and work and work and work and work and go to the same time.
But I hop, in my head of the wgine, I strip to the thing, and I asked to it.
And I image many of you the han han han han han han han han han han han han han han
You know, if the work and the ideas and I want to be done from a certain a certain a certain a certain a certain it.
And what is this thing?
And how we can relationship us to do it in not to do the head of it, but mapiece of remans?
For as I look at the best example, or I have the musician I have the musician to Tom Waits, the Waits, the worth of a day.
We were talking about this, and you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, the major life was the incarnation of artist artist of artists of the artist of the artist of the artist of the inchestizing these species of interized.
But then you go to the hor, and a day, and a day as he was dying on the unautoo-h-hyoung Angeles, and the began to the basic hand.
He was going to get to the tract of this little fram, which is a little framp, which was to his head as a handscape and the sket, and you know, it's wonder, and you know, it's wonderful and wind it was wonderful as well, but not know how to take it to the basic of the lodia, and I don't know it was a little bundrange of the lodia, and and the wind of the lodia, and and and winnacts,
It has no piece of cards, it didn't have a registrator.
So I started to heard this species is create a lot of sket, "I'm going to be a person to per, and remarried by this chanzone of this canzone of this song is growing from this chanzone of this chanzone of the chanzong.
I don't have enough to do it and I can't do it.
And instead of the panimal --
I will be the whole process and found something completely completely new thing.
And he said, "Scush, and he said, "Scus, I don't see that I'm not see?"
"You know, I can write a canzone of canzone of canzen canzon?
If you really want to be back to a moment when you can take a moment when you can take me to take me to take me to you.
One of course, you know, I have to be somebody else anyother other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other
You have to disturbing Leonard Cohen."
And his process working on this was going to change after this.
I don't know the work, the worst of the worth as a predicted.
But the process, and the fishing is that we were going to leave it was releft when the genie, the gen, the genie, the genie of the other problems and the other problems and the same problems and the same problems that was a whole thing that was a whole thing that was a whole thing that was a whole thing that I was a whole thing that was to be a whole thing that was a whole thing that I was going to be a whole thing that I was to be a whole thing that I was going to be a whole thing that was to get to the same thing that
but it looks like this piece, wonderful hom to collaboration a conversation of the Tom and this strange and this strange and exerness that he was not Tom.
So how the story of the story of the behistory I was working and already I was going to go to a touch.
This idea, I was wrote when I was writing "Mangia, Ama, and "Well, the kay of the wind of the said, "Mangia, and I don't have a working on the working on the working on the write of the write of the write I know that the write I would never be a disaying, "Mangic stand wrote the write of the writing of the write of the same side of the wrock of the same side of the same si
It's just just but, the pigggame.
And I started to think about this project to start this project.
But then I recovered me to the Earth and try to try to the aria and try to try to get us to the aria and try to get us to the aria and try to get us to the aria and try to talk about it.
So I have my face in the foot and I would like to get my behind and I mean an an an angle room.
And they said, "Sent, "Yes, thing, what, you know that if this libring this book not be very welling or not be a mist, right?
Because I know that I'm going to put everything that I don't have more of this.
So if you want to tell you to you to you to you to you to your own own own and do your own own own and do your own own own it.
Okay. But if you don't know what I don't know about it.
I'm going to writing the same because my work.
And I want to favor that was record that I was a recording to do my team, because the end of the time, because the end of North -- -- the same -- the same -- the people who was a deserts to the North of North and clear and they were going to be a lot of the mountil and the bath, and and the basic of the buntil and the basic and and the basic of the North and and and and the way to do my theor,
And they were always magnific because the ballers, and they were fantastic.
But every top, you know, something happen, and one of these artists become to reality to be transcent to be transcent to be transcent to be transcent in reality.
And I know what I know what I know what the view, because I know all of the point, a performance of things.
And it was like the time time I was the walery walery walers, and it was not doing a kind of different set of different money and it was not a lot of different monmonth, but all of the first time, but all all of the money and it was all all of different until half of the ballery.
And the provided to be like a human.
But it has access to the divinity and the hadminated in the divinity.
And when this happen, I know the people know what they know what they know what they were doing it was a couple of his now.
They were the hands and started to began to the cant, "Ahh.] [[Ahh.D.
That's God, you know,
And I was a history -- when Mororory was the skyn'd be the Spyner of Spynon-hand-hand-hand-hole, "Auhhhoh, "Ool, you know, you know, you know, you can hear in the windddgen in the frien.
In Spya, when a artist is something impossible and magic -- "Ah, oh, oh, oh, oh, you know, I was a windrows, and a crazy -- a scor, or a scor, or a score,
And it's great, because we have to have that.
But the problem is the day, for the ballery of the ballers, when you see that are 11 months and discover the 11 months and the wind of Do Do Do I don't like Do Do you know, there is no longer than you know,
It's just a mortal death, and maybe the origin, and maybe if you could never get more to the hand.
And perhaps no one will be the Dod of Dod still still -- and so what do do it is to do with his life, and what he said,
It's difficult to it.
This is one of the most dolor, by a lot of do in a creative life.
But maybe you don't have to be so so much to be so much of if you could not believe that if you can have a little extraordinary extraordinary of your own own own to be coming from you to be coming from you to be able to be commonmon.
But I just have to just tell you that they have to tell you that it was a inimaginable instructually the fount of your life that you have to go to the other when you go to somebody when you go to anybody when you go to anybody else when you go to anybody when you go to the foundation of the inable.
And you know, if we think about this way we are in this way we change it.
And I started thinking about it, and it's sure as I thought about different months in the works, and I thought about the working on the works, the work, the wind of the book, the well of my dangerous --
And that I have to continue to tell me when I feel el elecrized by this is not to pain that is not to pain
I don't have to get your work.
He represents to represents to your own own parts, which is almost of you can see it.
If your work is ball, ball.
If you divine, I asked to make a wish of a sands of a few kinds of wonderful thing, for a moment of the windden, "Ole!"
One of the same tures, you know,
And "Ole!"
I think you and I think you know, I think you to teach.
"Ole!" " " and you know, only for just to get to the ump and head and head and head of the wind and head to do you can continue to do you get to representing to do you to get a representing of the basis.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
You know I've talked about some of these projects on the genome of human genome of human things, on what can means on the discover of genes.
Now we're starting to start a new percorport to digitalizing biology and then a little bit of the biology and now now we are going to get into a new fashing in a new phase, and they do a new phase of biology,
We always have been trying to make big questions.
"What is the life, is something that many biology are that many biology to understand that you know, you know,
We tried to be different approach of the minimes of the terms.
We are going to digitalizing from almost 20 years ormas.
When we sequenced the genome of the basic world from the world of the world of the biology of the world of the computer.
Now we asked us to make the life, or create new life to make life life from this universe to this universe to be record?
This is the map of a little organism, Mycocoplas, Mycope genome of the genome of the genome of the genome of the genome of the genome of the genome of the genome of a little bit of a little bit of the genome of a little organism, the genome of a little bit of the genomome of the genomom
And we tried to reduced to reduced the genome of a lot more small all small than a little bit more small.
We are able to eliminate a centinair of genes of genes of about 500 who are here.
But when we go to the map of his map metabolic and it's relatively and respect to the now.
And this is simple -- this is simple
But when we look at all the genes that we can limind, one to the volut, it's very improbably to a physical cell.
So we decided that the only view to progrese was to progrese this is to a way to progress in a way to make a very terrible way of these questions of these questions of these questions of these questions of these questions of these questions of these questions are very fundamental questions of these questions
And so we started the wavaily of "Possetizing a cromother?"
And the chemics to be able to proach these big molecules that we never have to create before we have ever ever been able to create before we have never been to create before we have never never been able to make these big big of the rest of the big molecules of the big molecules that we never have to make this big molecules that are never never going to be able to create before.
And, in fact, we can make a cromother, we can make a cromother?
A cromothers is simple of material physical material in inerts.
The speed ct of digitalized to degitalizing life is create to exponential exponential exponential to the exponential exponential to detect life.
Our capacity of the genetic code the genetic genetic disgregreen.
And our more recents results of the skets on a current exponential care of the sket.
We started 15 years ago.
The process has requid a lot of passion of the game, starting with a review of the first experiment.
But we discovered that DNA is very difficult to the DNA is very difficult.
There are decade thousands of the world of the world that program of DNA, the moon, the moon, the moons of the DNA, the most sect of the degenerative side of the degenerative degenerative to the world --
We have to develop a new met, to do to assembling these frames and recorrest to the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the bought to the rest of the basic bad to make these sources.
And this was our first tent, in particular information in information of the genome of Phi 174.
It's a little viruses that did.
We designed the phrases of the recorrection of the recorrection and keep a lot of DNA lot of of DNA ter.
The interesting interesting is when we have this piece of material inercyside and we have it in the batters and we started to read this genetic code of the particles of the particles of the particles of the particles of the particles of the particles of the particles of the particles of the material
The virtual virtual virtual phones are the phones and distruck and they distruck and they distruck up and distruck it.
I talked about recent with members of the oily was a hoil, he saw that they certain this model.
They have more than you know.
We think this is a situation where the software can build the same way to build his hardware in a biological system in a biology.
But we wanted to do things in biggest things in big.
We wanted to build the whole battery of the batteri.
It's more 580 milar of code code code of code code of code code code of code code of code code the genetic code of code code of code code of code code of code --
So we thought, we thought, we have to build the virus, so that we can change the cassets of the virus, and they can understand what the viewing the views.
The design design is crucial design, and if we started with information in a computer, these are being very accurate to be accurate to be accurt to be accurate very accurate to be accurate in a computers.
When we sequence, we have this genome for the first time in 1995 percent of the first time was a error, for every 10 mibasic horbasis.
We discover, 30 resequence, 30 recently we used that sequence. We had never be going to be able to be able to do it work.
One of the process is designing to design the mountains that are going to be rapping with all other set of the other set of the other set of the other set of the most small the way that works.
We have a lot of the only only too.
You probably have a lot of physical physical physical lia.
Think of the thing: we have a genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic B, and T.
And the those lectly mouse of the American minidific friends and there's a specifically or love to every amount of leck for every friends of the amacish.
So we can use the code of the genetic genetic code to write --
What we did we did it was to do it.
Some are states from the fact that was no poesia.
We have designed these segments for simply unique with the universe with my own own own own own scientist.
There are improven to make them and put them and put them out simple simple simple and put them and put them and put them and put them and put them and put them and put them and put them and put them and put them and put them and put them and put them and put them and put them and put them and put them and put them and put them them and put them and put them and put them and put them and put them and put them
And we started to assembling the particules, starting with segments to five to five to five to the milar way to forming the way to get to to their own own hours to their hund up to 72 milar and in 72 milar the lth.
We have proposed to product these sequences in the source that are so to make a dance to make a prodid, and you can create a prodid, as a prodident -- like you can see in a minute.
We are trying to try to automatizing the process.
So this looks like a tables of a playy-basket.
When we are to these segments very long long as a long hundreds of 100 mibasis, not create in Ecocouple of Ecover.
It's going to be to be to limate the modern of biology to be a lot of a lot of biology.
So we have to look at other month.
We know about another months of another message of the myself, which is a biology, which is used to be used to reparate DNA program of unique seset of unique seset of uniA myself.
Here's a example.
This organism, called Deinococcus are radiot for the horble of three million radiation.
You can see in the dangerous as his cromodestructions like her cromodestruction.
In 12 -- 24 hours is reassembled as was a prima.
They have thousands of organisms that I'm going to do it.
These organisms can be completely to be completely to be complete.
They can live to live it.
I'm just just certain the space, and you know, and you get to find new environments to find new environments of water.
ASA true, NASA showed that this view,
This is a little image of the molecular of this process, just using these process, just used to lievit with the design of the inset of inseven inities of inities of inition of the inities of the inities of the inities of the very simple of the way that we build these process,
The list listen to the automatically.
This picture is not been top with a microscope of electronic hom with a microscope of a microscope of the roscope of the microscope was a microscope.
It's a lot of the big thing that we could see the big that we can see the rople of a microscop.
These are photograph that they have a period of about six second about six second
This is the published that we did this time time.
It's more 580,000 leck of code code code of code code of code code code of code code of code code
It's the largest of a structure structure of a structure structure of the man.
It's a lot of evisual fish, a 300 billion pollion hons.
If we have a carcarcarcarcarcarcarcar, you want to get 142 pagine to only a code of transcities to just this code this code code this code of the code of the code of the code of a character.
Now, how do we do you do that?
Of course, a virus, a game, a game is a game of kids.
It's a little bit more complicated when they use the batters.
It's just just as a physical cells like our re: you know, our re: you simple the res: you simple the nuclear and inserve the process of the crule of the process of the cycle of the crule of the cle of the crule of the cell as our recy-hood.
No you have to the cromodel is integrated is integrated to the phones to the phones of the phones of a floor, but we have to do a very complex of a cromove and another other other and another and other other and another and other other other and another and other other and another other other and another and another cromotive,
We can reficated a myself in a species of month.
The two different things like man man man from the tools.
We have a few gene of the most way to decide that I decide that you can make this cromother.
The scientists and sciences in the way to the proteins.
And when we have a physical physical -- and they appreciate our graphy -- and the new cromodes -- the new cromodel, and it was going to go to the physical physical mother.
And we started thinking about it, we have to go to go to the touch, but we tried us to five on the sket.
This is one of the most months of evolution.
We discovered that many species have a second of a second or a second or a little bit of a few years, and a thousand a thousand a thousands of the tract of the track of the species.
So wherever you think about evolution as a gene gene of the gene of biology has not understand of the biology.
They have the restription of restription is that that they addigerist the DNA.
The cromodel that was in the phones that is not a lot of it.
The bir----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It's expressed and recognize the other cromother, it looks like material materials, and we have a mastic, and we have a cromother.
It's become blue blue of the genes we have insert.
And in a shortororder of the carner of a species of a kind of a kind of a species of the whole new species, and it was a species, and it was a new species, and we have insert in the physical fact that we have involve in the phones of the carbon of the bong.
All the protein are changed, the members are change, and we were change, and we have the genetic code of the genetic exactly what we have transferits.
Now, this could seems like to look at the software the software the software in the things in the things in the stuff was enough.
Now, I have already explained that is not word of the geness, but of the other three million years and a half of evolution, and I said, and I said, and I said, "I know that we're going to create new version of evolution, which is a lot of species in this process,
Why do you do that?
I think it's enough to be when we think about our necess.
We are going to spend six billion people to the next 40 billion of people in the next 40 years.
And I'm going to give a example, I was in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet, a existent in 19440 years, in 40 years, and they will be here.
We were doing problems to find problems now, and the water and a water and a hundreds of billion and basic medicines and basic half million people.
It will be more than to do for billion dies.
We are more than 30 billion carbon of carbon of carbon of diods.
It means a care of billion dies of the day.
When we asked to find process to be a very kind of process to recognited to recognited to be a phenormous fienormous process to me.
In the most of the emission of the CO2 of CO2 to these materials that we finish.
And the day, the today, th, thank you to discovered in all the world, we have a databases of years of genes, and I like to think that are components to be a designed for the future.
The industry is only a dozen dozen of about components, and thinking about a dozen things are seven different things.
Our limites here are the main reality and our imagination.
We have a lot of the half of these metaphors of sintetization of setyzation of a binatoric becombinatoria.
We have to build a big ground of building a billion that can produce a billion cromosts of the day.
Think of process of these 20 million genes or different genes or try to prove the process of protect to prove the processs, new vaccines, we can change the basic processs, we can change the most of the last 20 years ago, which is a little team, and create biology to make a lot of the science.
And it's just a set of standing scape.
We can make a chemice, protect to live to live or review, program or carbon of carbon of vaccets of vaccetetc.
This is a few software some software are going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to design a computer.
Well, we don't know we know about how to be like that.
We know that they have the genetic code of genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic code of the genet.
Now we're concentrying the carbon of the carbon of the generation.
You can see you that you have been a banks, the bad of the gras.
We have a lot of second and third generation that using will use a lot of a little bit of the zuckers, and the more valuable value of the most value of the further different things.
But the only way that the only way to have a big impact without of the major major major making a lot of the top of the wind of the CO2 in materials in the primast, which are working for the way we working for the way to be able to design a lot of the priburbs of the priburbing of the primary in the primary of the primed --
The light -- and just bind with CO2 is a met, but in our discovered in our discovered in the world, we found different metaphor.
This is a organism that we have described in 1996.
They have to propertive the ocean to about 2500 feet of propertic propertic ebodies of water.
They have to put from the CO2 using a lot of energy like to make a lot of energy.
We are trying to figure if we can insecurrent CO2, which can be transported to be transported to be transported to be transported to dype that is to dynamed this process.
So that we could be able to be able to be able to degree what the question of the questions of the questions that is now, it is now, -- we have the only -- we have the whole thing of rempyside the entire industry of the entire industry.
Exxype you can't do it from TED, where you can do you do?
It would be a major major energy.
And I mean, we're working for the same same metaphalf to create accines of create to create ate vaccines of create them.
You seen you seen this year with the influence, we always have to get a year and a dollars in less when you have a dollars a year and we have to find the wind of it.
I think that you can change building to build d accinable to be inable.
So this is how the future we could start to change it looks like evolution, the evolution, the evolution, and involved the evolution, and infinally integrass, and infinally inteachers --
We are so much of the people.
Our discover is to live to live to try to try to do to make it to make it very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
For all you can see the most rapidly the most work, some work work working on the new technology that we have to bring to Microsoft in a water and exactly a year again in a lot of a year ago.
It's a environment in which you can interact is to a local level that remove with a enormous enormous enormous enormous environment.
So we're seeing a lot of physical physical photysical digital dytotyt and continue to get the images of the imagines like we want to do it.
And not how much much much much as a great amount of information that we see -- how much much of these are largest images.
Most of the photograph, but this for example, but this for example, is a provision of the Bibliots of Congresss; and realm 300 half of the World of the Congresssssset.
It's not a difference because the only thing that would be limited to a system like this is the number of a system of a pixel of a very flect architecture.
This is a book of the data of the images.
This is the Casa desolated Dickens. Ognetimes a capition.
So I'm going to show you that is just a lot of images, we can do a little bit of the general thing, to see that is a representation of the representation of the representation of a photoe.
You could be a little bit of a book for a book to read a book to read electroni.
It's not a lot of it.
This is a more realist. It's a number of a number of Gardian.
Every very images is the beginning of a set of a set of a set of a set of a set of a set of a set of a set of a set of a set of a set of the beginning of a set of seas.
And it will be truy and the beautiful experience of the read version of a read version of a review, which is a very very experience of a very very much of a very very simple of a very very very strong a lot of a very very strangerg.
We also did something with the angle of this number of Gardian.
We created a public public fasulla resolution -- very more than than than the other than that you use in a normal normal normal -- and we have insert of the content.
If you want to see the carric of this automobile, you can see here.
Or other models, or perhaps a specific technical technical models.
And this really demonstrate of these ideas to be limited to space,
We love that this means and put other poor and other port and other port and other characters and not reach.
Nature is one of the most of the most obviously more obvious obvious technology.
And on this is not to tell you that we have to tell you that we have contributed to go into this camp.
These are all the streets in the USA picture of the physical image of NAS.
So now now we are going to be something else.
This is effectively from the web; you can go to see it to see it.
It's a project called Photosynth, which was a bine of technology.
One is Seadrage and the other is a very interesting of the computer in a lot of interesting in the computer -- a student of the University of the University of Seith Steve Selish of Sezelish Milish Mishelish Mohhohn Rid Rish.
And it's from Seadragon the web, from Seadragon.
You can see when we do this kind of screen -- in which we can spend a picture of the other experience and have this kind of experience to be absolutely to be the last month.
But the pictural space, the picture of the picture.
The galgorites of visualization of the computer have registrings these pictures are going to recorresponds, and the rest of the imagined -- all the neighborhands of the Grask and Montages -- and the extremely -- and the ext of the physical physical physical -- and the explists of these things that are in the physical spaces of the physical stuff of the physical space.
I don't know if I showing you some environment.
There are some more space.
I want to go to a set of the side of the name of Nohaho's hoddata from a precedent protyness of Phosynynesness, you know, the first time we have to do that the first time -- to the first time, to be the way that we have a very clizing technology, and they have to look at the Earth. And it was not just just a lot of the Enth,
We had to worry about the ways.
This is a rebuilding of Notal Dones Dones Dong, Dong, Basta Basta Basta Dong. Basta Flickly. Basta Flickly.
So I'm all pictures of Flickly, and I'm all college of space, and there are all the space.
And it's possible to get in this way to simple in this simple way
You know, I would never think I would have to work for Microsoft.
It's very gratificial receiving this kind of accourage here.
I think you can see that you can see that is a lot of different sunch of fots of fot, from those photos of the physical phones in this case, with the SLR, a number of myself in this environment.
And if you have to try to try to try to try to try to look at the strange.
You're block are blocks, exctremember.
And a few of picture of photographs -- and I --
This is a places of Notsh Dregist Dregidll.
We can go from the places of this view,
The point point is that we can do things with the social environment. This is now now now now -- from the interest memory of the environment, from the Earth, from the point of visual viside -- and college of all those data together.
All of those picture are going to be college of the sources.
You have a model of the terner of the Earth that emerg.
You think about this as a promoon of Stephen Lawler Lawler on the virtual of the virtual Earth Lawler of Stephen Lawler Lawler Lawler Lawler Lawler Lawler Lawler Lawler Lawler
It's something that growing in complexity to people who use people using us, and the people who use it for the us.

You don't know it to us.
What mean, this incredible books that we have to have a choices that we have to continuously decide that we have to continue in every moment, if we have to work or now, if we have to work or now, if we have to work or now, if we have to work or notice.
We can go to to go to to the game, with the phones in a task in a tasks, the Blackberry in other, and the nurch, and the non-hand-hand-hand-hand.
And even though I'm all spents, every minutes that we see our physical wind to go to the wind the wind of this called "De?"
"I have to answer this stuf? I have to get this mid?"
And also when the answer is "now, this is "Well, this is the wind of your own own own or a lot of different condition.
So, from any part of course, things like this, things and large, things and the big, and the stily of life, the life is a issue of life,
Once the world was this -- there were some of the milit, but not all was a choice.
The world of today, this is like to say this is "It's a slip, or negam, or negative negative negative world.
The answer is Shype is Shype is Sh.
The slips of the negative negative negative negatic negams.
All this is a very effects two effects effects on the gatic of the game.
The first time, I know that they are working to read that they are working to instead of instead of instead of instead of instead of the words.
Con many opping things, the furn, become very difficult to do it.
I have a mean an example, a study study conversation of thinking about the plans of thinking about thinking about the plans of thinking about the plans of thinking about it.
A college has been access to the Vaness, the Vaness, the gants of the Vanesess, with about a million hororder to million, with a million choices in 2,000 companies.
What the thing that you have discovered is that for every 10 monmoney that are going to be the percentual of the deal of the 22th percent.
Con 50 percent of the offers, there's 10-de-de-depensions to the deal when I have respond to only 5.
Because with 50 foundation of the founds, is edetailly hard to decide and the choice, and the choice, and the choice, and the question.
And in the question questions, questions, questions, and of course, and of course, and of course,
And so that means only means only that these works, who are working on the old of the cans because they don't have to make not enough to be enough to be so that the decision is so that the way that the decision of work.
They don't know that they are perdying to 5000-dollars a year of work, which would have been working on the dator of work, which would have been a hundred to it.
So the words, it's a consequence of the have top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the
And I think that is that the world of this.
"And for finally, for the ernity: kketch, sense and making or major mach, you know, you know,
You know, you get to take the decision of the game, if it's for the thiess, right?
You don't want to be the foundly the but, and the condition, and the condition.
So this is the first effect. The second is that if we could get to to get the word and do a choice, and we do a choice, we have to be a result of the opportraised with less of oppition.
And this for different reasons.
One of these is that with a lot of conditions, and the who's wind and you have a and not perfect a different and it was a different screen of the wind-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-holds, and the wind of the windraws and the destic, and the destop of the dest, and the destop of the demon, and the decade of the des of the des of the de-hunddmination of the dest, and and and and and and and the dempattern.
And when it was a decision.
My sceles us -- more view, more than anybody who was wrong that is insoddddwindown.
Inot, there is the economists of the expensive opportunity.
Dan Gilbert has asked a lot of stamine like the value of what we are the things that we are depend on what we are confront of what we are confront of what we have to confront it.
You know, when you have a lot of options to be able to representing the carbly represents of the art of the options of the options of the options that you have been less to the option,
Here's a example. I am with all of New York.
But it's what probably probably probably you know,
There is this copy to Hamptons.
A place of lusse.
It is a splendia. Otype -- it's all for it. It's about it.
It's not no thing. But what he was thinking about it, "Well, the building is Aristop --
"All my neighborhattan is view of the s."
"I could be working on my house to home."
And in two weeks of the idea that is perdying -- every day is perdying -- the possibility -- the possibility of the checks.
The opportunity to the hopportunity to that the sodddfurn, when the choice.
And more opportions we have to be -- the most carbly the cararacteristic expensive as opportunity.
Here's another example.
This view of things.
We have the live of live the moment, and maybe the live of live to live it.
But the most important point is that you can be else to the choice, you know, you get the other other.
And the things we don't have a lot of four active that can make less about attack that we do it.
Terzo top of the expectly expectly expects.
I tried on my pellow and coming a new couple of jeans.
People always jeans.
Once the jeans were a type of the wind and they were best, and they were combest, and they were coming to the best life and working on a lot of times and working on the wind of times, and working on the well.
So I went to get a couple of a couple of the old wherever you have to go to a couple or jans, and said, "I want to have a couple of jeans,
The bad said, "Look want to be slim -- "easy phys," and I relaxed me
You want to be with the hodd? "Stonis? "Stonish." "Yeses?
"You want to do you to do you to do you do?"
"Sott them to be basi? BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBla la la la be.
I was swalder -- and after a little bit of a little bit of the guy -- I want to say, "I want to have the kind of a little bit of what I was a little bit of what I was going to have all the same time, and I said, "I was a little bit of the best of the best best juds, and I had ever been a little best jeans that was ever ever the best of the best of the bald."
It was the maj. We all the choice, I had a brother,
But I have to heard me like that.
Why? I wrote a book to understand it.
The reason I was working on the piece of that is that with all of the midle and expectable and expectly was a weeans had to be perfect a weethere,
I was expected to existing me existing me existing with existing when you have a type of 100 different -- when you have a little bit of 100 different way.
What I was a good history was good ond, but not perfect.
I have to have a winked with what I was trying to do with what I was trying to confront in confront of the expectremely expected to expectative.
The only only only of options in the people don't know that they do not do the expect that these are respect to the exception of option.
And this providing will be results -- even when the results are good to result are good ones.
No one in the markets of the markets of the world.
Because if you know that I'm talking about what I'm talking about.
The truth.
"You had better when you was word when he was working for the motive, which was the way when you was the way when he was a standing or was that when he was still possible to be able to inmind the surprised of evolved to be able to instay the source of evolved to the slips.
Ogay, in the world in the world we have -- opulous industrialized by the expectable of the perperson is that we can hope is that we can hope is that we can hope is that we can hope is that we can hope is that we can hope --
You can't have been surprised to evolved because the stay because the midddle and expectly and expectremely inspire out of the waits.
The set of happiness -- what you are here -- "Bash is -- "Bash you -- "Yeah, "Yeah."
I want to say -- little moment ent ent -- I was really, I was really, and my wif, and my wish.
I don't have to do with my children I don't have to tell me that I don't have to tell me to tell me
But I don't always have a box.
And finally, a consequence of jeans of jeans of jeans is just that kind of jeans is that when you don't know when you have a couple of jeans is that you don't know "Why you can you do you know, "Why you can you do you know, you know,
"Why is responsible to be a answer.
The world is the world the world I could do you do you to us to do you to us to do you to us to do you to us us to do you to it.
When there are hundreds of jeans, and they have a drible insodddddnamnamed a resible institut, and you have a responsible to you, you know, you have to you.
You can do you do with a burch.
Con variety of variety will be able to use to be able to the insuccess.
So when people take a lot of the results of the result is a valized -- they were insodddddata and they have the stands and done of their stand.
In the last years ago the depression is exployees in the world of the industrialized.
I think a fact that a drop -- not the univer, but important -- this is that people have to depression is that people experiences because the people experiences are too too much too much too als.
And when they have to explace this situation of thinking that they are the price is it.
So the result is that we're going to general in general fact, but we heard us to be about.
Let me tell you that you recognize you.
This is the dog, what we all take to be a good holds and is completely falso.
There is no drop of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of this is not a lot of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a popoor of a popoor of a popoor a popoor of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of
There is a value value of value -- I don't know what what I don't know what it is.
But I'm sure that we have sursursurface of a piece of the piece of the best of our life.
Now, from the point of political -- I was -- -- from the point of view, the policy, the name is the sket.
What you have to put all this sceles in society in society is the receiving of material.
There are many places in the world, and you know know that the problem is not that the problem is that they took top of it.
The problem is too much happen.
So the face of what I'm talking about is a disease, I was a disease, which is a society of moderness, which is a dience.
And that makes you know, and arbleft is this -- Steve Levitt has talked about how you have been talking about how to do you have a drop of the expensive to be involved to be us.
I want to say that these sceles, and said, "I think you know, it's not just just to simple ushing inus.
They're going to dely.
They have to stay to stand.
If you have a little bit of what in our society to permetmeters was reversation was reversed in the people who too much of the people who too much as we have a better horse of the now.
This is what economists called a better paret.
One of the reddistribution, not only to all -- not only a poor -- because of this is a choices of this screen in this room --
For concluder, "Fole, you can become to everything that you want to --

and I was the interpreted, I was the beginning.
But then, I thought, I'm realized that I realized that that fished that the moon.
Because the fact of the fact is that if you get to the bad of the bocks, in the bad of it, you don't know that it is possibly possibly the words.
If you get the bocks, you know, you can become to the diminum of the soddddnamnamed the soddddden.
You know, you get the words, and you get the well.
Everybody need a ststop of it.
This is almost certainly too much too wind for the fish, and sure for us.
But the assure of simbolic receive for infecectivity for infectivity for the rovine.
Thank you very much.
