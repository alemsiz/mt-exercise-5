The last year I showed these <unk> <unk> that the <unk> <unk> <unk>, which is <unk> <unk> <unk>, for three million years of <unk>, <unk>, <unk> is <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> is <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And so this <unk> <unk> <unk> because it doesn't <unk> the ice of the ice.
The <unk> <unk> is, in a sense, the heart of the <unk> of the <unk> system.
They <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
The next <unk> will be a <unk> <unk> on the last 25 years.
<unk> <unk> are <unk> in the <unk>.
As you see, you're <unk> to the blue <unk>.
That's the ice in <unk>, which is <unk> <unk> <unk>.
You can see that the <unk> ice, of five or more, is as <unk> <unk>, which here is as a <unk> <unk>.
In 25 years is so, so, in 25 years.
This is a problem because the <unk> <unk> <unk> around the ocean <unk> around the ocean <unk> where there are huge <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, they're <unk> in <unk>.
<unk> at the <unk> of <unk> <unk>, the <unk> of the global <unk>, that we're <unk> this point of <unk> not <unk>.
In some <unk> <unk> <unk> is already <unk> <unk> <unk> is already <unk> from water.
The <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>! <unk>: You know, "<unk>. The question is if we <unk> it.
A reason is that this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> <unk> from the <unk>.
This is a river in <unk>.
The <unk> had never <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This is the river <unk>, in the <unk> of <unk>.
If you want to know how <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> on <unk>, here is where the sea.
These <unk> are <unk> <unk>.
And then on the planet, the most <unk> of the planet.
The month, the last month, the <unk> of the ice is in <unk>, and that <unk> <unk> on some <unk> <unk>, is particularly <unk> in <unk>.
And we're going to <unk> <unk>, as in <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, the <unk>, you see new <unk> ice, you see new <unk>, which is a few years ago.
The 40 percent of the world <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>: This is the <unk> of this city <unk> of this city.
The <unk> is <unk>.
But when we <unk>, the same happens to the water.
In <unk> <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> percent.
<unk> <unk> are in crisis.
<unk>, as you read, they're <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> in the world <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> are <unk> <unk> out of the <unk> out of the <unk> and without <unk>.
<unk> times <unk> in the last 30 years than the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This is a <unk> of all <unk>.
If you look at the context context, if you can see the <unk>.
In the last five years we <unk> <unk> million <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in every day.
Look at the <unk> <unk>, <unk>, from the <unk>, and <unk>, and on both the parts of the <unk> <unk>, where there's a <unk> <unk> of oxygen in the ocean.
The most <unk> of the global <unk>, and <unk>, which is 20 percent, is the use of <unk> <unk>.
The oil is a problem, and the <unk> is even even even even.
The United States are one of the two countries with the most <unk> of the world with China.
And they <unk> to build many other <unk>.
But we're <unk> to a <unk> direction.
These are the <unk> <unk> in the last years and some <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And so, there's a <unk> politics in our country.
<unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> million dollars in the last year to <unk> <unk> <unk>, which is a <unk>.
I <unk> image <unk> something --
<unk> <unk>, in <unk>, where I live, there was a <unk> <unk> billion <unk> <unk> <unk>.
You've seen it on the <unk>.
This is the second <unk> <unk> in America.
It's success around.
The <unk> <unk> of one of <unk> was this.
<unk>: <unk> â™« <unk> the <unk> is a <unk> <unk> and happy.
It's <unk> here in America, and it does our economy.
<unk> the <unk> is always <unk>.
It's good price, <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>: <unk> here is great part of the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> is <unk> <unk>. This is <unk> <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> <unk>: <unk> <unk> -- <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> -- not know what they're talking about.
<unk> <unk>: So the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> two <unk>.
This is a <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> <unk>: <unk> <unk> to see the changes as a <unk> <unk> <unk> to our business.
So, this our <unk> is <unk> a big <unk> of money in a <unk> <unk> to make it in a <unk> <unk> and <unk> the truth.
In fact, the <unk> is not <unk>.
We think it's <unk> -- it's a good <unk>.
So we don't <unk> <unk> of climate change.
We do to do that.
<unk>: <unk> <unk> -- you know, you've heard very much.
So I <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> for how to <unk> <unk>.
<unk>! The machines are a little bit, but this is the sound of technology of <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> of <unk> is between the <unk> of the global <unk>, but the technology of <unk> <unk> that you see everything.
And we look at the <unk>: this is the technology of <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>: <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> of the national <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>: The economy is in the economy; the economy, the <unk> <unk>, the <unk> crisis.
The <unk> that <unk> all: our <unk> <unk> <unk>, as the <unk> <unk> and oil.
Now, but, there's a new, <unk> solution to <unk>.
<unk> America: 100 percent of energy <unk>, in 10 years.
A <unk> <unk> for America to the work, <unk> <unk>, and to help <unk> the global <unk>.
<unk>, a solution that we <unk> to solve our problems.
<unk> America. <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>: This is the last.
<unk>: <unk>: It's <unk> energy to America.
One of the most <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> <unk> <unk> that we <unk> our planet.

If you want to go from the <unk>, you go. "
We have to go from the <unk>, quickly.
Thank you very much.
The last year at TED <unk> <unk>.
And <unk> <unk> <unk> on how the works works.
So, I <unk> here. And for those who the other time, there were, the <unk> is the most <unk> <unk> <unk> miles of <unk>.
The <unk> is <unk> <unk> the conditions that were less than a <unk> <unk> <unk> in the universe -- to <unk> millions of times to <unk> millions of times to <unk> million times to <unk> million times.
All that's just <unk>.
This is the car under <unk>.
They <unk> these <unk> <unk> in the <unk>.
This is what work. It's called <unk> <unk> -- is <unk> <unk> <unk> feet and he's a <unk> <unk>.
This is a <unk> image of <unk> in the <unk> <unk>.
The 10 <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> the first time.
And this picture was <unk> by <unk>.
It was <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk>.
It's an image of the first <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk>.
In other words, when we <unk> the image, <unk> <unk>, <unk> that the <unk> <unk>, which is a big <unk>.
I don't know if I was about that <unk> <unk>, or this <unk>, when somebody <unk> on Google and <unk> that the page was <unk>.
That means that we had a <unk> impact on the <unk>.
And then we had a week after, there was a problem with the car, they had to these <unk> here -- these <unk> <unk> <unk>.
These <unk> <unk> <unk> when the car works in the <unk> of <unk>.
Now, the <unk> between you <unk> and <unk>, "Not true." It's not true. "
And instead can do that because when they're very <unk> <unk> <unk>.
So, in less <unk> degrees, to a <unk> <unk> at the space of the stars, these <unk> can <unk> that <unk>.
In one of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> in the <unk>, there was a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
So the <unk> <unk> <unk>, and the <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk>.
This was the result.
Now, this is more <unk> if you think that these <unk> <unk> <unk> more than 20 <unk>, and you're <unk> about 30 <unk>.
They're <unk> about 50 <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, what we did.
We <unk> them and <unk>.
Now, they're <unk> all at their <unk>.
And then the end of <unk> the <unk> will be new <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, and we <unk> to get the data to <unk> or <unk>, and so our <unk> to understand what they're <unk> the <unk> that <unk> the universe.
Now, of course, in a way, these <unk> <unk> the <unk> of science and <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk>. It's easy to <unk>.
I think the fact that is so hard, the fact of the <unk>, I think it is the value of things like <unk>.
I'd like to <unk> with the words of a <unk> <unk>, which, <unk>, in <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, he said, "No," <unk>, "<unk> is <unk> for the <unk> of human mind as <unk> as <unk> as <unk> as <unk> as <unk> as <unk> as <unk> as <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk>.
Thank you.
I want to start <unk> to <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk>.
<unk> as <unk> and <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, <unk>, <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> to the way that we <unk> <unk> in the world around us.
So, from <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of our <unk> with <unk> objects, and <unk> <unk> <unk>, and my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk>, and if, we use a computer, instead of <unk> as a computer <unk>, and when you have a computer <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, a <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, a <unk>.
and we <unk> to our <unk>?
The question was so interesting that we <unk> to explore the answer, we <unk> the answer.
In a few words, a <unk> is a computer computer as a <unk>.
In a few words, a <unk> is a computer computer as a <unk>.
You can <unk> them with the hand, they can <unk>, "<unk>" between them, and they're a <unk> <unk> and a <unk> <unk>.
But <unk>, they're <unk> objects, as the <unk>, you can <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> is the example of a new <unk> of tools to <unk> the <unk> information.
And they <unk> hand that become more <unk>, <unk> of the <unk>, of the <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, and hand, as they're <unk>, and other, as <unk>, to <unk> them, and <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We <unk> with some simple example.
This <unk> is <unk> to show the video: if you <unk> the video, the video so, the video <unk> so, if you <unk> the other <unk>.
These <unk> <unk> are <unk> <unk> of other.
If you <unk> them, you know what they <unk> around.
If they <unk>, you <unk>, you can <unk> a little bit.
If they <unk>, you <unk>, you can <unk> a little bit.
They also <unk> their movement and <unk>.
We <unk> <unk> that one of the interesting <unk> of <unk> was the <unk> of <unk> <unk>, for example, to <unk> <unk> <unk>, for example, as if it was a <unk>.
In this case, we have three <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>, and I can <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk>.
and I can <unk> for <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk>, where you <unk>.
If you're <unk> too, we can <unk> a little bit about it.
I'm also <unk> to <unk>, as the <unk>, the mathematics and <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Now, I'm --
This is a <unk> <unk> that I do with a <unk> <unk>.
Here we have a game of words that is to half <unk> and <unk>.
<unk>, to <unk> a letter to <unk> a letter on every <unk>, <unk>, to every <unk> <unk>, and as <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and as <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And then, about 30 seconds, and you have a new <unk> and <unk> and new <unk> to try.
Thank you.
Here's here, the kids in <unk> <unk>, I did it in the way that we <unk> and <unk> a video.
They are <unk> very much.
And one of the interesting things of this <unk> is that you don't have to people.
I just say, "<unk> of the words," and they know what to do.
Here's here's other people who <unk>.
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk>, there's the <unk> <unk>,
In fact, it was just <unk>.
They just <unk>, for him.
Now, this is a <unk> of a <unk> <unk>.
And we build a <unk> <unk> <unk>. He's <unk>.
It can <unk> new <unk> in the <unk>, <unk> their <unk>.
It can <unk> new <unk> in the <unk>, <unk> their <unk>.
So, it's doing the sun.
<unk>: The sun is <unk>.
David <unk>: Now, he <unk> a <unk> in the <unk>.
<unk>: The <unk> <unk>.
<unk> work!
So, <unk> the <unk> and <unk> can <unk> the <unk>,
<unk>: <unk>!
<unk> your story.
<unk>: <unk>!
<unk>: It's a story with the final <unk>, and it can understand it.
<unk>: It's a story with the final <unk>, and it can understand it.
<unk>: <unk>, <unk>.
<unk>: The last example that I have the time to show you is a <unk>, for <unk> and <unk> music.
It's a <unk>, <unk>, for <unk> and <unk> music.
The <unk> here <unk> <unk> as the bottom, and the <unk>.
And they <unk> of these have four different <unk>, and you can <unk> what you use.
You can also <unk> these <unk> in a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And I just <unk> a sound <unk> a sound, "and a <unk> <unk>."
These are actually that you can control from the <unk> and the <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk>.
And then there are the fact, as time and <unk>, which is <unk> <unk> to the entire <unk>.
It's going to be like.
<unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> in two <unk> <unk>, "<unk>," <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>, the other <unk>.
Now, I'll <unk> a <unk> line.
<unk>: <unk> <unk>. Now <unk> <unk> <unk> --
<unk>: <unk> <unk>. And now I <unk> the <unk> <unk>, so I can control the <unk> <unk>.
<unk>: I can <unk> the whole <unk> <unk> <unk> the time to the time to the time to the other.
<unk>: <unk> <unk>. And now we <unk> the bottom <unk> to <unk>.
<unk>: I can <unk> the <unk> <unk>. "
So I don't have to <unk> before, but I can <unk>, <unk> more <unk> or more <unk>.
And now, finally, I can <unk> the whole <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. "
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is to build new <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and more <unk> to how to work and body.
And today, I had time to show you one of the <unk> of this <unk>, and some <unk> that we're looking at the lab.
The concept I want to <unk> is that this new generation of objects to <unk> with the <unk> <unk>, which we want to <unk> information in our world way that we want.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the hour of you.
They're a <unk>.
<unk> books is my <unk>, but it's more than this, of course.
It's also the love and the <unk> of my life.
And I don't think about the <unk>.
But,, something like this, something like, in my career, and my career, which <unk> me to <unk> the whole <unk> with this work.
And the particular thing is that I <unk> this book, this <unk> called "<unk>," <unk>, "which," the <unk> <unk>, "which, I <unk>, and <unk> a big <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
And the result is that <unk> now, people <unk> me as if I was <unk>.
<unk> -- <unk>, <unk>!
I'm going to be now and say, "You don't say," You don't know, I'm going to do better?
You don't know, you're not going to write the life without <unk> <unk> <unk>, to make a book that can <unk> someone? "
What can you <unk> to someone? "
It's <unk>, you know.
But it could go worse, I remember the most of the 20 years ago, when I was <unk> to say, I was <unk> to people -- I wanted to be a <unk>.
I <unk> to <unk> the same <unk> <unk> from <unk>.
And people said, "Don't <unk> to be <unk>?
You don't think the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> you?
You don't know that <unk> to do this <unk> to the life without anything to <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>? "
So, you know.
The <unk> -- the short answer to all these questions is: "
And I think, I'm <unk> all those.
I always had <unk> <unk>.
And I also have <unk> many other things that people can't <unk>.
As the <unk> and other things.
But, as I thought I thought and I thought I was, and I thought, and I'm going to me, and I'm going to me and I thought, and I was about the <unk> of the <unk>, and I thought I thought and I was going to me, and I thought, and I'm going to me, and I thought I thought I thought, and I was
Is it <unk>?
It's <unk> that anybody who <unk> <unk> <unk> to be <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
But what is that there's so particular in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> about health <unk> in a way that other <unk> don't they do?
How do my father, for example, he was a <unk> <unk> and I didn't remember a <unk> <unk> and not <unk> <unk> if he was <unk> <unk>?
And there was never -- that <unk> of John <unk>, how do it?
They don't <unk> so, <unk>?
<unk>, <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, they don't have of course, in the <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We <unk>, we have enough enough this <unk>, and not only <unk>, but we have this <unk> <unk> of being <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And not <unk> else that look at the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> young and often, young and often <unk> for their own.
And even those who are not <unk> to be <unk> <unk> by their <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, first of <unk>, in the last <unk> said, "Every book, I <unk> a little bit more" <unk> <unk> about the work of their life.
But we don't <unk> when we've heard these things so much as much as as as we've <unk> <unk> and <unk> the <unk> that creativity and <unk> <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> are in some <unk> and <unk>, to the <unk>, to <unk>.
And the question I want to <unk> to all here is: you're <unk> with this idea?
You're going to tell you this thing -- because it's also <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
I think it's <unk>.
And I think it's also <unk> and I don't want to <unk> <unk> in the next century.
I think it's better <unk> our big <unk> to live.
And I know, in my case -- in my case -- it would be very <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in my career.
<unk> -- look at <unk>, I'm pretty young, I have about 40 years.
I still about four <unk> of work in me.
And it's very <unk> that any <unk> now in the world as the work that <unk> <unk> <unk> after the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, because we're all more or less friends here -- it's <unk> that my <unk> is to my <unk>.
Oh, <unk>, <unk>, which thinking!
You know, this is the kind of thinking that <unk> a person to <unk> <unk> <unk> at the <unk>, and I don't want to do it.
I'm going to do this work that I love.
So, the question is, how?
And so, so after many <unk>, which the way to work to write what we're going to write a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, OK?
I have to find in some way to find a <unk> <unk> of me, and my natural <unk> <unk>, and my natural <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and I <unk> to <unk>, as we <unk> to look at the time, to find the time, to find them and <unk> ideas to find more <unk> and more <unk> and more <unk> <unk> and more <unk> to find <unk> ideas and more <unk>.
<unk> on how to help people <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity.
And that research <unk> me to the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>.
because I <unk> because they <unk> back and then <unk> back.
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> -- people don't believe that the <unk> of the <unk> of men, OK?
And they <unk> that creativity was this <unk> <unk> and <unk>, and that <unk> to the men, for reasons reasons and <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> <unk>. "
<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> were the same idea, but <unk> that species of the <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> is <unk>, because the <unk> didn't really <unk> someone who <unk> was a particularly <unk>.
And I thought a <unk> was this species of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, a little artist, and <unk> <unk> out of the <unk> <unk>, and <unk> out of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the work.
<unk> <unk> here is, the <unk> <unk>, which is the <unk> <unk> you <unk> from the <unk> of your work.
And all <unk> that was so that <unk>, right?
So, <unk> artists were <unk>, as well, as as a <unk> <unk>, not?
If your work was <unk> not <unk> <unk> all the <unk>, all <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
If your work, it was not all <unk> your work, right?
And all <unk> that was your <unk> to be a <unk>.
And so people <unk> <unk> the <unk> of <unk> <unk> to very time.
And then the <unk> <unk> and all <unk>, and <unk> this big idea; we put the human <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk>, and <unk> this big idea.
This was the <unk> of <unk> and people <unk> to think that the <unk> of <unk>.
And for the first time in the history, and <unk> <unk> to this or that artist as a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And I have to <unk>, I think that was a big <unk>.
I think I would <unk> to someone, a simple person believe that I would like to be as a <unk> as a <unk> as the <unk> and <unk> <unk>, <unk> and <unk> is a <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> is a <unk> <unk> to <unk> human <unk>.
It's like to ask somebody <unk> the sun.
<unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> the <unk> and <unk> all these <unk> <unk> on the <unk>.
And I think it's been this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, 500 years.
And, if this is true, and I think it's the question, and now?
Can we do it <unk>?
We would go back to a <unk> <unk> of the relationship between human relationship between human and <unk>.
Or maybe.
Maybe we can't <unk> 500 years of thinking about <unk> in a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And there's probably people between the audience that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of <unk>, you do people <unk> <unk> <unk> on their projects.
You don't know about this thing.
But the question I'd like to <unk> is -- why don't?
Why don't we <unk> in this?
Because it's more than any other thing that has ever heard for the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
A process that, as anybody who ever <unk> to do something -- so, so, all here -- so, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, a process that's <unk>.
And, in fact, it can <unk> <unk>.
I did this <unk> <unk> with the <unk> <unk> <unk>, which has now <unk> <unk>, but that was a <unk> for the life and said that in his <unk> <unk> <unk>, and he said that in his <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> out in the <unk>, and <unk> <unk>.
He said that was like a <unk> <unk>.
And that <unk> <unk> <unk> to her from the <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk>, because he <unk> the land under his feet.
And I decided to have one thing to do about that, and it was, and <unk> as a <unk>. "
And so I was <unk> to the house and he was <unk> from this <unk>, and it didn't have another piece of paper and a <unk> <unk> <unk>, as the <unk>, and <unk> <unk> on the page.
<unk> times, they don't have enough enough, so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> the <unk> <unk> and she would <unk> and she would <unk> to <unk> the <unk> and she would <unk> to <unk> through the <unk>, and he would be <unk>. "
And then there were those times -- this piece never -- there was the moments of times when the <unk> was almost <unk>, OK?
So, was <unk> to home and he was trying to <unk> and the <unk> <unk> through, and <unk> a <unk> <unk> in the while I was <unk>, and then he was <unk> with the other hand and then <unk>.
<unk> the <unk> <unk> from the tail and the <unk> on the page and the <unk> on the page.
And in these cases, the <unk> would be <unk> on the page and <unk>, but the last word to the first.
So when <unk> <unk> <unk> -- is <unk>, it's exactly <unk> to my <unk> process.
Not all my <unk> process -- not a <unk>!
They're a <unk>, and my way, and the <unk> of <unk> is; <unk> the same <unk> and <unk> and work and <unk> on <unk>.
But even I even <unk> against that, I <unk> against that what, sometimes.
And I think that we had a lot of you <unk> the fact.
You know, even if the work and the ideas <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And what is this?
And as we can <unk> to it in the way to do that that you can't <unk> the head, but rather, you do it?
So as I'm going to be the best example of <unk> that I have <unk> <unk> <unk>, which I <unk> different years ago to <unk>.
And I talking about this, and you know, <unk>, for the <unk> of life was the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk>, trying to <unk>, <unk> these species of <unk> <unk> <unk>.
But then <unk>, <unk>, and a day, and a day when he was <unk> on a <unk> <unk>, <unk> everything.
I'm going to <unk> and all a <unk> <unk> this little <unk> of <unk> <unk>, which is <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, you know, and the <unk>, you know, and the <unk>, but not as <unk>, but not how to <unk>.
He didn't have a piece of paper, he didn't have a <unk>.
So, I could start to feel this species of <unk> <unk> in him, "the I'm going to <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk> from this <unk> <unk>.
I'm not <unk> enough and I can't <unk>. "
And instead of go in <unk>, they <unk>.
And we <unk> the whole <unk> <unk> and <unk> something new.
And I just just the sky and said, "<unk>, you know," What are I'm <unk>? "
"You know, you know, I'm going to write a song?
If you really want to <unk>, you're going to <unk> <unk>, when I can <unk> <unk> <unk> to you.
<unk>, <unk> to <unk> <unk>.
I <unk> to <unk> <unk>. "
And the process <unk> <unk> after this.
Not the work, the work, the work was still <unk> as always <unk> as always.
But the process, and the <unk> <unk> that was <unk> when <unk> <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, the <unk> that <unk> out of the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, where it was not to be a <unk> and <unk>.
But I <unk> this <unk>, wonderful <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> and this <unk> <unk> and this <unk>, and it was not <unk>.
So as as <unk> that story to change a little bit of the way that I <unk> and I've <unk> and I've been <unk> a time.
This idea, I <unk> when I was <unk>, "<unk>," and <unk>, "and <unk> in a <unk> of those <unk> <unk> in which we're working on something and not <unk> and <unk> it and <unk> to think that's a <unk> <unk>, and it's going to be a <unk> <unk>.
Not just <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And I <unk> to think about this project.
But then I <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> to the air and <unk>.
So I <unk> my <unk> <unk> and <unk> my <unk> and <unk> my <unk> <unk> in the room.
And I said, "<unk>," <unk>, what we know if this book is not going to be <unk> <unk>, no?
Because you see that I'm <unk> everything I'm <unk> that I've got, not more than this.
So if you want to do it is better, you have to do your part.
OK. But if you don't do it, you know what it's not going to be <unk>.
I started to write the same because it's my work.
And I'd like to say that I was <unk> that I'm <unk> to do my part of "because, the end is so, OK, OK, <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the moon, and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> hours and <unk>.
And they were always <unk>, because the <unk> were <unk> and <unk>.
But every <unk>, something <unk>, and one of these artists <unk> in reality.
And I know what you know, because I know what you have all, as you know, a <unk> <unk>.
It was like if the time <unk>, and the <unk> <unk> through a <unk> <unk> and he was not <unk> different from <unk>, but they <unk> <unk> before, but everything <unk>.
And the <unk> doesn't just <unk> as a human.
But they <unk> from <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> <unk> of <unk>.
And when this <unk>, the time, people <unk> what was, <unk> <unk> what was, <unk> with his name.
They <unk> your hands and <unk>, "<unk>," <unk>, <unk>, God, "God," God, "
That's God, you know.
<unk> <unk> -- when the <unk> <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, <unk> this <unk> <unk>, and <unk>, <unk>, "<unk>," <unk>, "<unk>," <unk>, "<unk>," <unk>, "<unk>," which you can feel in the <unk>, "<unk>," <unk>, "<unk>," <unk>, "<unk>," <unk>, "<unk>,"
In <unk>, when a artist has something impossible and <unk>, "<unk>," <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> -- a <unk> of God.
And it's <unk> because we need.
But, the problem comes up after, for the <unk>, when you <unk> and <unk> <unk> that are 11 and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's just a <unk> with <unk>, and maybe maybe we've never <unk> to <unk> that <unk> <unk>.
And maybe no one <unk> the name of God as <unk>, and so it has to do with the rest of his life?
It's difficult.
This is one of the <unk> <unk> to do in a <unk> life.
But maybe it's not to be so <unk> if you're <unk>, we're not <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, the <unk> <unk> of your being being being <unk>.
But I just just just <unk> that <unk> <unk> from a <unk> <unk> of this <unk> <unk> <unk> of your life that you have to <unk> other when you're <unk>.
And, you know, if we think about this way.
And so I started <unk>, and it's <unk> as I <unk> for different months in the <unk> of the book that <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
And that I have to <unk> when I feel <unk> with this is, not sure that I'm going to be <unk>.
Not <unk>. <unk> only your work.
They're going to <unk> for your part, any of any of the,
If your work is <unk>, <unk>.
If the <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> some kind of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, then you're going to be <unk>, "<unk>!"
You do the same <unk>.
And "<unk>!" You're going to do the same.
I think it's <unk>.
"<unk>!" You know, you know, as the same, even for the human <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk>: <unk>!
As you know, I talked about some of these projects on the human genome, and what we can <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> genes.
Now we're <unk> a new way: we started <unk> the biology and now now <unk> the <unk> of that <unk> <unk> in a new <unk> of biology, <unk> and <unk> life.
We always tried to <unk> big questions.
"<unk> is the life?" It's something that many <unk> I think they're <unk> to understand <unk>.
We tried different <unk>, <unk> to the terms of <unk>.
We're <unk> by 20 years.
When we <unk> the human genome <unk> <unk> <unk> of biology to the world of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the computer computer.
Now, we can <unk> the life, or create new life, or create new life <unk>?
This is the map of a little <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, which is the <unk> species from the <unk> <unk>, which can <unk> in the lab.
And we tried to <unk> the genome to <unk> the genome to <unk> a <unk>.
We're able to <unk> a <unk> of the genes of about 500 genes that are here.
But when we <unk> a look at his map, is <unk> <unk> <unk>, is <unk> <unk> to our own.
<unk>, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can <unk>, one to the time, is very <unk> that this can <unk> <unk> <unk>.
So, I <unk> that the only <unk> was <unk> this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of these questions.
And so we started the <unk> of "We can <unk> a <unk> <unk>?"
Can the <unk> <unk> <unk> of these big molecules that we never had to create before we've never been doing before we have to create before we've never been doing before we've never been able to make the <unk> <unk> of these big molecules that we've never been able to make the <unk> <unk>
And, in case, we can make a <unk> <unk>?
A <unk> is just a piece of <unk> <unk>.
The speed with which we're able to <unk> life is <unk> to <unk> <unk>.
We have to write the code, instead, instead, <unk>, but it's <unk>.
And our <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We <unk> more than 15 years ago.
The <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> with a <unk> <unk> before <unk>, we <unk> the first experiments.
But we found that <unk> of DNA is very difficult.
There are <unk> of thousands of machines at the world that <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and it is a <unk> process: the most <unk> is <unk>, more <unk> than the <unk> is <unk>,
So we had to develop a new <unk> to these <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
And this was our first <unk>, to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's a little <unk> <unk> that bacteria.
We <unk> the <unk>, <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> a <unk> <unk> of <unk>.
The interesting part is when we <unk> this piece of <unk> <unk> <unk> and we <unk> it in the bacteria, the bacteria have <unk> to read this <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> are <unk> by cells, they're <unk> by cells, and they <unk> the <unk> <unk>.
I talked about the <unk> of the <unk> industry that they have been <unk> <unk> this model.
They have <unk> more than you.
And that this is a situation where the software can really build the same <unk> in a <unk> system.
But I <unk> to do the <unk> things in great.
We had to build the whole <unk> of <unk>.
They're more <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
So we thought about <unk> <unk> <unk> of the size of the <unk>, so we can change the <unk> to understand what the <unk> are <unk> of a <unk> cell cell.
The <unk> is <unk>, and if we <unk> information in a computer, these have to be very very <unk>.
When we <unk> this genome for the first time in the <unk> <unk> was a <unk> <unk> for every 10 <unk> <unk>.
We found, <unk>, 30 <unk>. If you <unk> that <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> never had to do that work.
A part of the process is <unk> <unk> 50 <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> with all the other <unk> <unk> <unk> to build more <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And I'm going to <unk> the <unk> here.
You know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you
<unk> <unk>: We have a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>: <unk>, <unk>, <unk> and <unk>.
And we <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> about 20 <unk>, and there's a <unk> <unk> <unk> for every <unk>.
So we can use the <unk> code for <unk> words, <unk>, <unk>.
What we did at the beginning was <unk>.
Some of the fact that was not <unk>.
We <unk> these <unk> <unk> <unk>.
There are <unk> that <unk> them and <unk> <unk>.
And we started to <unk> <unk> <unk>. And we started <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
In fact, we have <unk> <unk>, so that we're <unk> <unk> <unk> because we're <unk> to create a very <unk> <unk> <unk> as in a minute.
We're trying to <unk> the process.
So, this seems to the <unk> of a <unk> of <unk>.
When we <unk> to these <unk> very <unk>, more than 100 <unk>, not <unk> <unk> <unk>.
They <unk> <unk> <unk> of the tools of biology.
So we <unk> other <unk>.
And we <unk> of another <unk> called <unk> <unk>, which is <unk> <unk> for DNA <unk> <unk>.
Here's a example.
This <unk>, called <unk> <unk>, can <unk> three million <unk> <unk>.
You can see in the <unk> <unk> as his <unk> <unk> <unk>.
In 12 hours, it's <unk> as the first.
We're going to be able to do this.
These organisms can <unk> <unk>.
We're going to live in <unk>.
They're absolutely sure that life <unk> in space, and you <unk> to find new <unk> <unk> of water.
And then, the real <unk>, the <unk> has <unk> that this happens.
This is a <unk> image of <unk> that we built using these <unk>, just using <unk> design <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This image was not <unk> with a <unk> <unk>, but with a <unk> <unk>.
It's a <unk> so big that we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk>.
These are <unk> <unk> that <unk> a period of about six seconds.
This is the <unk> that we did a little bit time ago.
They're more <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's a <unk> <unk> <unk> at 300 million.
If you <unk> a <unk> <unk> 10 <unk>, we <unk> <unk> pages for this <unk> <unk>.
Now, how do we do this work? How can we <unk> it?
<unk>, by <unk>, a <unk> <unk>.
It's a little bit more <unk> when they use.
It's more simple when it's about cells as our: you just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> another, and <unk> another, which is <unk> <unk>.
In the <unk> <unk> is instead of <unk> in the cell, but we <unk> <unk> <unk> that we're able to do a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> cell cell <unk>.
We <unk> a <unk> <unk> from a <unk> <unk>.
The two different <unk> as men from <unk>.
We <unk> some <unk> in the <unk> way that we can understand what to do for this <unk>.
The <unk> has <unk> with the <unk> <unk> in the way to all the <unk>.
And when we <unk> in the cell <unk> was <unk> and <unk> our <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> our <unk> <unk>.
And <unk> <unk> that we didn't go to the <unk>, but we tried to <unk> more in there.
This is one of the most <unk> of evolution.
We found that <unk> species have <unk> a second or a <unk> <unk> <unk>, in a <unk>, in a second of new <unk> <unk> <unk> in a second of new <unk>.
So who think about evolution as a <unk> <unk> to the time that <unk> is not <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the DNA.
The <unk> that was in the cell cell not <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> that we <unk> the <unk>.
It's <unk>, and it <unk> the other <unk> as <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and we <unk> with only the <unk> and the new <unk>.
It's <unk> <unk> to the genes that we <unk>.
And in a short <unk> of time, all the <unk> of a species are going to go, and it's <unk> <unk> in a new species, we <unk> on the <unk>.
All the <unk> are <unk>, and the <unk> are <unk>, and when you <unk> the code as <unk> <unk>.
Now, this could be <unk> <unk>, but we <unk> the software can change the things in a <unk>.
Now, I've already <unk> that here is not about <unk> <unk> -- but it's about <unk> million years and a half million years and a half million years and the <unk> of <unk> in which we're <unk> new <unk> <unk> <unk> in which we're <unk> new <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Why do do that?
I think it's pretty <unk> when we think about our <unk>.
We're going to go to six billion and a half billion people to <unk> billion in the next 40 years.
Right for a example: I was born in <unk>.
Now, there are three people on the planet for <unk> <unk> in <unk>; there are four.
We're <unk> problems now to find food, water and <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, and <unk> for six billion and half billion people.
They're still <unk> to do that for nine billion.
<unk> <unk> <unk>.
That means percent of <unk> <unk> a day.
When we're looking at <unk> <unk>, or any kind of <unk>, it's going to be a huge challenge.
We have to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And so so on today, thank you <unk> <unk> in the world, we have a <unk> with about 20 million genes, and I like to think the future.
The industry <unk> only <unk> <unk> about <unk>, and think about how many different things are <unk> <unk>.
Our <unk> here are <unk> data from the <unk>, and our imagination.
Now we have <unk>, thank you to these <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, able to create what we call <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We're able to build a big robot that can produce a million <unk> <unk> a day.
Think of <unk> these 20 million genes or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to produce <unk> or <unk>, new <unk>, and we can change, <unk>, and <unk> <unk> to <unk>, and more <unk> <unk> to <unk> biology.
And it's just a <unk> <unk>.
We can <unk> to <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> that we're working on to be able to be able to <unk> and <unk> species to <unk> computer and <unk> species to <unk>.
Well, we don't know how to be.
We know exactly what they <unk>.
Now we're <unk> on the <unk> of <unk> generation.
You know, you know, you know, <unk> <unk> <unk> was a <unk> experiment.
We <unk> <unk> <unk> and third generation that <unk> enough enough to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or different kinds of <unk> as the <unk> or different kinds of <unk>.
But the only way that we have a big impact impact without <unk> the <unk> of food and <unk> the <unk> of food and <unk> the <unk> would be <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk>, and we can <unk> the first generation of <unk>, and we think we're going to <unk> the first generation of <unk> to <unk> to <unk> the <unk> of <unk>.
The solar solar <unk> with the <unk> is a <unk>, but in our <unk> <unk>, we found different <unk>.
This is a <unk> that we <unk> in the <unk>.
<unk> in the ocean, at about <unk> feet of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of energy as the <unk> of energy.
We're trying to understand if we can <unk> the <unk> <unk>, which can be <unk> by <unk>, <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, to <unk> this process.
So to the short think we could be able to <unk> what the question of "which is the question of" that is what the <unk> is life <unk>.
You can't do that. If you can't do this from TED, where you can't you do that.
It <unk> a <unk> of energy.
And we're working working working for the same <unk> to create <unk> <unk>.
You saw this year with the <unk>, we're always back to a year and with a dollar in less when it's about to find the right <unk>.
I think what you can change <unk> <unk> in <unk>.
So, this is how to start <unk>, now, the tree of evolution, <unk> the tree, <unk>, <unk> the <unk> <unk>, and then <unk> cells.
We're at so so from people.
The goal is to do in the way to live enough to <unk> to try to <unk>. Thank you very much.
So, I'm going to show you, the <unk> possible, some <unk> work, some <unk> technology that we <unk> to <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk>.
It's a <unk> in which you can <unk> is to local level that <unk> with a huge <unk> of data.
Here we're seeing <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and a <unk> <unk>, and <unk>, to a <unk> <unk>, <unk> the images like.
And not matter how big big <unk> of information that we see, how much much of information that are these <unk> of data or <unk>.
Most of the most <unk> <unk>, but this for example is a <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> <unk>, and <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It doesn't have any difference because the only thing that <unk> the <unk> of a system as this is the number of <unk> on your screen. It's also a very <unk> architecture.
This is a whole book, example of data not images.
This is the <unk> <unk>. Every <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
So, to <unk> that is the <unk> and not images, and not images, to see what they can do is a real <unk> of the real <unk>, not a <unk>.
It could be a little bit of <unk> to read a book.
I don't want to <unk> it.
This is a <unk> example. It's a <unk> <unk>.
Every image is the beginning of a <unk>.
And it <unk> you really <unk> the <unk> of a <unk> version of a <unk> <unk>, or a <unk>, which is for nature <unk> nature.
We also did something with the <unk> of this number in particular <unk>.
We created a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk>, you can see here.
Or other models, or even the <unk> <unk>.
And this really <unk> some of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of space on the screen.
And I think this <unk> to <unk> and <unk> other <unk>, not <unk> to be <unk>.
Of course, the <unk> is a <unk> <unk> for this kind of technology.
And on this is not want to <unk> time, if not to say we have <unk> to <unk> that we have <unk> to <unk>.
These are all the <unk> in the United States on a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
So now I'm going to do something else.
This is actually <unk> from the Web; you can <unk> to see.
It's a project called <unk>, which <unk> two different technologies.
One is <unk> and the other is a very interesting <unk> to the computer <unk> <unk>, a <unk> of <unk> <unk>, a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And it's from the <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
You can <unk> when we do this kind of <unk>, where we can go to another image and have this kind of experience to <unk> <unk>.
But the <unk> <unk> of images here has actually a meaning.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk>, in the way that we <unk> all <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. And so you see that they're all <unk> of <unk>, and they're <unk> <unk>.
I don't know if I've been time to show you some other environment.
There are some much more <unk>.
I want to go to the <unk> of data <unk> <unk> and this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that we did work for the first time <unk> to show you what we did is really the <unk> <unk> to show you what it is really the <unk> <unk>. And it's not <unk> <unk> <unk>. And it's <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We had to <unk> <unk> and <unk> and saying.
This is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk>. And so on. And he <unk> <unk> this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
So, they're all <unk> <unk> and they're all <unk> <unk> <unk> in this way.
And it's possible to <unk> in this way.
You know, I would never be thinking about this <unk> to work for <unk>.
It's very <unk> <unk> this kind of <unk> here.
I think you know that it's a lot of different kinds of <unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk>, a <unk> <unk>, a <unk> number <unk>, a <unk> number, <unk> together together together this environment.
And if I can, I <unk> to <unk> those <unk>.
Many are <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk>.
And then, in some part here -- <unk>.
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We can go from the <unk> <unk> to physics of this environment.
The point is that we can do about things with the social environment. This is now <unk> data from the whole <unk> <unk> <unk> of the whole <unk> of <unk> as <unk> and <unk> all of the <unk> of <unk> and <unk>.
All those pictures become <unk>, the <unk> of the parts.
You have a <unk> model of the entire earth that <unk>.
And think about this as the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> on Earth <unk>.
It's something that <unk> in the <unk> of the people <unk> <unk>, and the <unk> that <unk> <unk> with the <unk> <unk>.
<unk> are <unk> with <unk> <unk> from other people.
If someone is the idea of <unk> all these <unk> <unk> the name, my <unk> picture of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of all those data, and I can use as a <unk> <unk> in the <unk>, and then, and <unk>, and I can have a social experience.
Of course, a <unk> of all of this is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> every part of the land, <unk> not only <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk>, but by <unk> <unk>.
Thank you.
CA: I realized that your software <unk>? What your software <unk> <unk> us to do is that to do is that to do is that in the next years, all of the <unk> are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>?
<unk>: Yeah. What's doing is doing this.
It's <unk> <unk>, if you want, between images.
And it's doing in the <unk> of images.
And the thing is very interesting if you think about <unk> information information that many of these <unk> <unk>.
As a research of images on the <unk>, you <unk> a <unk> and the <unk> page has a lot of information about the <unk> <unk> of the picture.
Now, what happens if that picture <unk> <unk> to all your picture?
So the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and the <unk> of <unk> <unk> that <unk> is really huge. It's a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
CA: <unk>, it's really incredible.
<unk>: I'm going to tell you very much.
One of the <unk> when you <unk> and one of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> is the <unk> that we can't live in the <unk> <unk>, and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And we think that the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, or <unk> <unk>, or <unk> are still <unk> <unk>, or <unk> <unk> <unk>, or in <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, to the <unk> <unk> <unk>, to <unk> the <unk> of <unk>, and the idea that is <unk> in the idea that we have no <unk> in which is a sense of the world, but it's actually a <unk> <unk>, but it is a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
the <unk> of a particular <unk> of <unk> <unk> that our <unk> <unk> has done, or <unk>, many <unk> <unk>.
And of course, all <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>.
We're <unk> to <unk> <unk>.
We have to <unk> the <unk> of death, so we don't <unk> and <unk> --
We all have a art.
What <unk> is the <unk> of the song, the <unk> of <unk> every culture.
It doesn't matter that the <unk> of the <unk>, or the <unk> of <unk>, or the <unk> of <unk> <unk>, or <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, or a <unk> in the <unk> of <unk>.
He was my <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> a month ago, or a <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk> of the world.
All these <unk> <unk> that there are other ways of <unk> other ways of <unk> other ways of thinking, other ways of <unk> to <unk> in the world.
And, if you <unk> a minute, is a second that can give you hope.
<unk>, the <unk> of the world of <unk> <unk> and <unk> that <unk> the planet and <unk> that <unk> the planet and it's important to <unk> <unk> as the <unk> <unk> <unk> as <unk>.
And you can think about this <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and you can <unk> the <unk> <unk> of all the <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>,
The <unk> is the <unk> of humanity.
It's the <unk> of what we're and what we can be in how we can <unk> as <unk>.
And <unk> <unk> <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and much more <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, for example, <unk> that 50 percent of all the species was or the species was <unk>, or is <unk>, or <unk>, or in the <unk> <unk> -- and <unk> -- and <unk> <unk> -- and not <unk> <unk> <unk> -- that <unk> <unk> -- that <unk> <unk> -- that <unk> <unk> -- that <unk> <unk> <unk> -- that <unk> <unk> <unk> -- that <unk> <unk> <unk> -- that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> of all that is, of course, the <unk> <unk>.
When you're <unk> <unk> <unk> on this planet.
One language is not just <unk> by a <unk> or a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>.
One language is the <unk> of human spirit.
It's the middle with which the <unk> of every culture comes in the world.
Every language is a <unk> of mind, a <unk>, a thinking, a <unk> of <unk>.
And of those <unk> <unk>, as we're in <unk>, at least the half the half of the children.
They're not more <unk> to kids, which means, to say, less than they're already death.
What there's more <unk> than the <unk> of being <unk> from the <unk>, the last to talk about a language, and the way to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk>?
This <unk> <unk> was the <unk> was <unk> in some of the world every two weeks: every two weeks a <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And I know, somebody of you <unk> "is not better so?
The world doesn't be better if we <unk> all the language language? "<unk>, then we're going to talk about <unk>.
<unk> <unk>.
And I <unk> a <unk> thing that means to talk about their language.
And I'd like to do a journey through the <unk> --
a little <unk> in the <unk> of what we're going to <unk> a <unk> of what we're <unk>.
Many of us <unk> that when I say, "I mean," I mean, "I mean," I mean, "I mean," I'm going to be different ways of us.
<unk> for example, in <unk> <unk>, the <unk> of <unk>, the <unk> of <unk>, which <unk> to the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's a <unk> that is not able to <unk> the blue color of the blue <unk>, because the <unk> <unk> is <unk> in the <unk> of the forest, which <unk> <unk>.
They have a <unk> language and a <unk> <unk>, "<unk> <unk>": you have to <unk> a different language.
All all this has <unk> in the past, but the <unk> is that in these families in which they're <unk> or seven <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
They <unk> to talk and then <unk> to talk about.
And I <unk> one of the <unk> <unk>, which I <unk>, the <unk> of <unk> <unk>, a <unk> that had the first <unk> <unk> in <unk>.
In <unk> five <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk>.
They did <unk> from the <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk>, which <unk> <unk>, <unk> that this <unk> <unk> <unk> had never seen anything <unk>.
They <unk> the <unk> <unk>. They <unk> the <unk> <unk> of a form or a <unk> and <unk>, they <unk> <unk>, and they <unk> the <unk> <unk>.
But the <unk> doesn't only <unk>.
They <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> percent of <unk> was <unk> by their own.
We're <unk> to eight <unk> and we found two cases of death and when we <unk> to know, they <unk> that one of them was so <unk> that's <unk>, and then they <unk> the same.
<unk> <unk> were able to <unk> the animal from 40 <unk> and <unk> the species.
And I was <unk>, the <unk>, I was <unk> a really interesting <unk> when my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> me if I wanted to go to <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And to give a sense of the <unk>, I would have to understand the culture and the <unk> is not <unk> <unk>.
It's pretty much about a <unk> <unk> <unk> of the world.
A interesting.
If you <unk> to <unk> the big <unk> of the world, what did I <unk>?
<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>,
A continent is always <unk> out, thinking that Africa is not <unk> <unk>. And instead and instead and <unk> is not that the <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
What makes the <unk> is the <unk> <unk> is the <unk> between the life and death.
So, the <unk> <unk>.
<unk> can be <unk> from <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>.
So, the <unk> <unk> <unk>, "<unk> <unk>," <unk> <unk>, "<unk> <unk>.
We <unk> in <unk> and <unk> God. "
And from the moment that you're <unk>, is the spirit that you can <unk> <unk>, how do you can <unk> <unk> <unk>?
So, you know, these incredible <unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. It's in a <unk> of <unk>.
They all <unk> with the <unk> that I <unk> the most <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, in <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
In a <unk> continent of <unk>, this <unk> never <unk> by <unk>.
And I <unk> today are <unk> by a <unk>, but their <unk> is <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The young young <unk> are <unk> from the families of <unk> or four, and they live in a world fact, and they live in a world <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> for 18 years.
Two years of nine years <unk> <unk> <unk>. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
So, this time, they're <unk> to their values of their society, and they <unk> that their <unk> and only their <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or to say the <unk> <unk>.
And I mean this <unk> <unk>, they <unk> out and the first time in their life, at the age of 18 years, and they see a <unk>. And that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, when the sun <unk> <unk> <unk>, and the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. The <unk> <unk> <unk>.
"<unk>? I'm going to tell you.
It's <unk>. Now, it's about you <unk>. "
They call <unk> more and they say that we, <unk> <unk> <unk>, we're the <unk> of the world.
This is very important.
When we think about <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk>, which is a <unk> <unk> in his <unk> or maybe <unk> and maybe <unk> and we say these <unk> are <unk> to the Earth to the Earth of us.
<unk> <unk> are not <unk> or <unk> from <unk>.
There's not space for these things in the <unk> <unk> or in the <unk> <unk>, but because of time and <unk>, they <unk> a <unk> of <unk> <unk>, they <unk> a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>, but on the <unk> <unk> <unk>, the <unk> of the Earth is <unk>.
What does it mean?
I mean that a <unk> of <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> that the mountain is a <unk> <unk> of the <unk> is a human <unk> <unk> and it will be different and it will have a different <unk> and it's a different <unk> and that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> is the <unk> of a <unk>, or a <unk> <unk> is <unk>.
What is interesting the <unk> that is the <unk> of the <unk> between the <unk> and the natural world.
I <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> for being <unk>.
And that <unk> me a human being different from my friends that believe that the <unk> are the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that live in <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>.
If you <unk> that these <unk> can create different, <unk>, we start to understand some of them <unk>.
I <unk> this picture at the <unk> <unk>.
Maybe some of you have heard about <unk>, the most powerful <unk> <unk> <unk>.
What makes the <unk> is not the potential <unk> is not the potential <unk> of the <unk>, but his <unk>. It's <unk> two <unk>.
And then, the side, this <unk> <unk> that has a series of <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, <unk>.
<unk> the only <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. And it's a little bit of the <unk>, but it's <unk> with the <unk> of the family <unk> <unk>.
This <unk> <unk> <unk>, very similar to the <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
If you'll see the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> that they do a different <unk> of species, it's <unk> <unk>.
<unk> that <unk> on the <unk> is a little bit like being <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a <unk> of the reality; it's actually <unk> <unk>.
And we often <unk> with my <unk>, Richard <unk> <unk>, the man who <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, with his <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk>.
My <unk> is not <unk> these <unk> as <unk> as <unk> because if you're not going to tell anybody anybody who are <unk>. <unk> <unk>. <unk> <unk>, but they can't be <unk> because they're <unk> <unk> because they're <unk> by <unk> <unk>, of course, in the <unk>, <unk>.
It's possible to <unk> <unk> only if we <unk> with other <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk>.
Now, the <unk>: <unk> that are <unk> in this <unk> are <unk> <unk> of <unk>, the same kind of <unk> to <unk> the <unk>. The question is <unk> <unk> <unk>: in a <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>, as they're going to <unk> two <unk>, but that we're going to be <unk> with the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. But if they're going to the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We use the big <unk> of <unk> and <unk>, which can <unk> <unk> <unk>.
But if you <unk> to the <unk>, we <unk> "<unk> plants."
What does it mean?
This <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, which <unk> <unk> in the forest, and that we <unk> in the forest, and that our <unk> <unk> in the same species.
If you <unk> as <unk> their <unk> <unk> <unk>, "<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>," <unk>, "I said," No. "
The solution is: You <unk> <unk> in a night, and <unk> <unk> <unk> with a different <unk>.
With this is not <unk> to <unk>, but it's much more than <unk> <unk>.
Now, <unk> the problem is that even the <unk> of us that they have the heart <unk> <unk> <unk>, but in some way to <unk> the <unk> of the story of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk>, and <unk>.
In fact, the <unk> century, <unk>, <unk>, not <unk> for his <unk> or <unk> <unk>, but rather as the <unk> was in which we <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the planet. Now, we're not the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> the planet. Now, and the planet is not the change. Now,
All the <unk> through the <unk> were <unk> in a <unk> for new <unk> to new <unk> of life.
And the problem is not technology.
<unk> <unk> don't have <unk> to be <unk> when they <unk> <unk>, and so they <unk> <unk> and so <unk> as <unk> <unk>, and they <unk> <unk>.
It's not the change or technology that <unk> the <unk> of <unk>. It's the power of <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And if you <unk> a look at the world, you know, they're not <unk> <unk> to <unk>.
They're <unk> <unk> and <unk> out of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> --
a <unk> <unk> <unk>, in the <unk> <unk>, a <unk> that <unk> <unk> in the forest to a generation ago, and now <unk> to the <unk> and now <unk> to the <unk> <unk>, where you can see the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And we <unk> the <unk> with the <unk> <unk> <unk> to the forest.
Or, in the case of <unk>, are the diseases that are <unk> with the <unk> <unk>.
If we <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk>, where I'm doing a lot of research, you'll see the <unk> <unk> of <unk>.
As <unk> <unk>, the <unk>, the physics of a <unk>, is <unk> to <unk> <unk>, but the <unk>, the <unk> <unk> of a <unk>, not only <unk>, but not only <unk>, because it's <unk> in some of the <unk> of <unk>.
And you can't understand the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk>.
I have <unk> miles from <unk> in China through the <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> to <unk> with a young <unk>, but only <unk> to <unk> <unk>, I realized what's the <unk> that's <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> million people <unk> from <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The father was <unk> <unk> to the <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> that means that was <unk> to the <unk> days of the Chinese days.
<unk> <unk> is <unk> with <unk> <unk> in the <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk>.
My mother was <unk> and his <unk> was <unk> and his <unk> was <unk>.
It was <unk> <unk> in <unk> age of two years <unk> in the age of two years <unk>, because he didn't have to live without <unk>.
The <unk>, which has done the same, was <unk> in the <unk> of <unk>.
A day <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and, for this <unk> <unk>, and this <unk>, was <unk> to the <unk> <unk> for seven years.
The <unk> of <unk> can be <unk>, but the <unk> <unk> <unk> is <unk> by <unk> <unk>.
And then, then you <unk> a choice.
<unk> we live in the <unk> world or <unk> we want to <unk> the world of the <unk> of diversity?
The great <unk> <unk> <unk>, before he said, the most <unk> <unk> <unk>, and in our <unk> <unk>, and in our <unk> <unk> <unk>, not only <unk> the whole <unk> of the world, not only <unk> the <unk> of thinking, but a day <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And it's <unk> to remember that our species is <unk> for <unk> years.
The <unk> <unk>, which <unk> us, we <unk> the <unk>, which <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> the <unk> of <unk>, and we talk about <unk> <unk> <unk>, and we talk about <unk> years ago.
The <unk> world <unk> <unk> <unk>.
That <unk> story not <unk> to me that we have the <unk> to all the challenges that we <unk> in <unk>.
When we <unk> of <unk> <unk> of the world is to say to be human, we're <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And it's in these <unk> that we all <unk> the opportunity to be what we're: a species, which has to to make it in the way that all <unk> and all the <unk> can <unk>. And there are great <unk> <unk>.
I <unk> this picture on the <unk> <unk> of the island of <unk>, when I went to <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk>, and this man, I <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The government <unk> is not always <unk> with the <unk> <unk> and in the '<unk> and in the' <unk> <unk>, we <unk> them in <unk>.
The <unk> of this man <unk> <unk>.
The family, <unk> for his life, <unk> all the <unk>, and all the <unk>, and all his <unk>.
They know, you know that <unk> is <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> of this man didn't <unk> by night or <unk> from the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's <unk> on, you know, the <unk> <unk> in the skin of <unk> and <unk> in your hand. When I <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk>.
He <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk> <unk> and when <unk> <unk>, he <unk> a dog.
He <unk> the dog and <unk> a <unk>, with the <unk> <unk> <unk> has created a <unk>, and it's <unk> on the <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and nothing? <unk>? And this, in different ways,, <unk> is the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> and all the <unk> <unk> of the world.
<unk> <unk> <unk> the government <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> of an <unk> area of a <unk> area of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's their new <unk>. It's called <unk>.
It's a <unk> <unk>. We <unk> all the <unk> resources.
One <unk> example of how a <unk> can <unk> with his <unk>.
And, to end, I think it's pretty <unk> at least who we had to be in these <unk> <unk>, and we <unk> that they don't have all <unk> at the <unk>.
For someone is home.
<unk> <unk> <unk> of human imagination that <unk> at the <unk> of the days. And for us, <unk> of these kids, as the <unk> of our children, and they're <unk> <unk> of hope.
So, we <unk> <unk> <unk> we're <unk> that the <unk> <unk> never to anything.
<unk> that <unk> --
<unk> <unk> are not <unk>, but we believe that stories can change the world, and maybe we're the best <unk> to tell stories of the world.
<unk> <unk> <unk> our <unk> <unk>.
We <unk> our <unk> are <unk> from millions of people.
Our work is <unk> in the <unk> to <unk> our audience in places of <unk> <unk> from which <unk> <unk> <unk> from which <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> for the <unk> <unk> of <unk>: the <unk> of <unk>, and find a <unk> <unk> <unk> in the world, and find a <unk> world.
where the <unk> of all the <unk> can <unk> our <unk> <unk>.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some things I wrote in this book that I'm going to talk about and <unk> <unk> <unk> some <unk>, in the case, not <unk> them.
I want to start with what I call the <unk> <unk>. "
The <unk> <unk> of what?
The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>: "If we want to <unk> the <unk> of our <unk> <unk>."
The reason is, by a side, in fact that the freedom is in the same <unk>, is <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> to human beings.
And we're going to be that if we're <unk>, every <unk> of us can <unk> to do everything that <unk> our <unk> <unk>, no no no no no no no one <unk> in our name.
The way to <unk> the freedom is <unk>.
The most choices are, and more <unk>, and more is their freedom, and more is their <unk>, the most choices is their <unk>.
This, <unk>, it's so <unk> <unk> in the society that no one <unk> <unk> in <unk>.
And it's also <unk> <unk> in our lives.
I'm going to show you some examples of what the <unk> is possible.
This is my <unk>. It's not particularly great.
I <unk> a simple <unk> on the <unk> <unk>.
In my <unk> <unk>, there are <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and 12 <unk> <unk> that you can buy a huge <unk> of <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that no one of the <unk> <unk> <unk> is <unk> of your <unk>.
That's what <unk> is.
And then you go to the <unk> of <unk>: <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
And in this single <unk> <unk>, there's a big number of <unk> <unk>.
We can make six million and a half million <unk> using the <unk> that there are in a <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> that there is <unk> choice.
<unk> <unk>: The world of <unk>.
And once, when I was a child, you could have all the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
They <unk> the phone, you don't <unk>.
One of what is, between the other, and the phone, it was that the phone never <unk>.
These days are <unk>.
We're going to be a <unk> <unk> <unk>, especially between the <unk>.
Here's the <unk> <unk>.
My <unk> is in the middle, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk>.
If you can't have the <unk>, you've seen in the <unk> <unk>, they're going to be <unk>.
And what is that the end is that people <unk> in the <unk> and <unk> this question. And you know, the answer is the answer? The answer is, "No."
It's not possible to buy a phone that doesn't <unk> things.
So, in other <unk> of life that are much more important than the <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> the same <unk> of choices.
<unk> <unk>: It's not going to be in the United States that you <unk> from the <unk> and the <unk> you know what you have to do.
Instead, <unk> from <unk>, and the <unk> says, "OK," OK, "OK," "" "<unk>" <unk> "<unk>" <unk> <unk>, and these <unk> <unk>, and these <unk> <unk>, and these <unk>. What do you want to do? "
You know, <unk>, what do? "
And the <unk> says, "<unk>, he <unk> these <unk> and these <unk>, and he <unk> these <unk> and these <unk> <unk>."
"What do do?"
And you say, "<unk> if she was, what do you know?"
And the <unk>: But I don't have her. "
The result of the <unk> <unk>, "<unk> <unk>," <unk> <unk>, "<unk> that it looks like a <unk> thing.
But in fact, it's not that a <unk> <unk> the weight and the <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, and not know, and not about fact -- and so not -- and so not in the <unk> of the patient.
There's a huge <unk> of products, <unk>, <unk> to people like me and you, if you think about it has no sense, because we can't <unk>.
But if we can't <unk>, why do we <unk> them?
The answer is that they want to <unk> the <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And so so the <unk> of the <unk> is a <unk> question of choice, as you see in this <unk> <unk>, "Don't want to <unk> the children." They don't want to <unk>. "You don't have to <unk>.
And we can <unk> how many times we <unk>.
The means that every <unk>, you have to do that.
I <unk> to the family and the <unk>, a <unk> perspective, <unk>, almost for anybody, and it was that we <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk>, and you <unk> to <unk> kids the <unk> possible possible possible possible.
The only choice was with who, when, and that we do do.
<unk>, all is really to play.
They're going to be very <unk>, and they <unk> their 20 percent in less than a time.
And because they don't have less <unk>, because they are less <unk>.
But why are <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, "<unk> <unk> or no?"
"<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>? I have to think before or <unk>?"
They're <unk> <unk>.
And they're trying to answer these questions, even if this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>, and not <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And they have to do that. They're important questions.
Now, the work: we're <unk>, as <unk> <unk>, because technology <unk> us to work every day, every day, every day, every day, <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, there is a <unk>, and I don't say no one which is.
I don't tell you, because I want to do it.
What means, this incredible freedom of choice that we have about the work? It's we have to understand, if we have to work or no.
We can go to see our <unk> <unk>, with the <unk>, with the <unk>, the <unk> in the other, and the <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, on the <unk>.
And even if they're all <unk>, every minute that we see our <unk> <unk>, we're also <unk>, "I have to answer this called"
"I have to answer this <unk>? I have to <unk> this letter?"
And even when the answer is, "no," everything is the experience of your <unk> <unk> <unk> your <unk> <unk>, very different than the <unk>.
So, from any part of the <unk>, and big objects and <unk>, and <unk> life, the life is a question of choices.
And once the world was: <unk>, there was some <unk>, but not everything was a <unk> of choice.
The world of today <unk> <unk> is, "The <unk> is," It's a <unk> thing, or <unk>? "
The answer is <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> them all, so I'm going to talk about those <unk>.
And we have this choice two <unk> on the people.
The first, <unk>, is that <unk> <unk> instead of <unk>.
With a lot of <unk> in which is very difficult to do it.
I'll give you a <unk> <unk>: a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
A <unk> <unk> had to <unk> data, the <unk> <unk>, the <unk> society, with about a million <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in different <unk>.
What she found she found is that for every 10 10 percent that are <unk> in the most of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
With 50 percent <unk>, there's 10 percent in less than <unk> when they're just <unk> to when they're just <unk> to be <unk>?
Because with 50 <unk> <unk> in which is <unk> to <unk>, and the choice is <unk> to <unk>.
And in <unk>, and again, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and of course, you can't be ever.
And I think that we don't just mean that these <unk> <unk> food to <unk> because they don't have enough money, to say that the decision is so <unk> that we're also <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of work.
They don't know, they're <unk> to five <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> for the <unk> <unk> year, which would be very <unk> to <unk>.
So the <unk> is a <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> is <unk>.
And I think that <unk> the world so.
"And for the <unk>, to the <unk>, <unk>, <unk> or <unk>?"
They're going to take the right decision, if it's the <unk>, right?
You don't want to <unk> the <unk>, and you're going to be wrong.
So this is the first effect. The second is that if we can <unk> the <unk> and <unk>, and <unk> a choice, to the end of how to <unk> <unk>.
And this for different reasons.
One of these is that with many <unk> between which you have, if you <unk> a <unk> and it's not a <unk> choice that could do a different choice. And that happens to do a different <unk>. And that happens to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And even when it was a <unk> <unk>.
The most choices is, more <unk> is to <unk> any <unk> of any <unk> of choice.
And then, there's what the <unk> <unk>.
Dan <unk> <unk> <unk> very well as the value that we <unk> to things that we <unk> to things from what we <unk>.
<unk>, when there are many <unk> <unk>, is very easy to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and being less <unk> <unk> and being <unk>.
Here. That's a <unk>. I'm not in New York.
But it's what you probably <unk>.
There's this <unk> to the <unk>.
A place of <unk>.
<unk> <unk>. It's all for them. It's all for them.
Not <unk>. But that he think he's, "Well, <unk>, it's <unk>."
"<unk> my <unk> are on the <unk>."
"<unk> <unk> <unk> in front of the house."
And it's two weeks weeks from the idea that's <unk> -- every day -- the <unk> of <unk> where you want.
The <unk> <unk> <unk> for that that we have, when the choice was <unk>.
And the most <unk> that we have <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Here's another example.
This <unk> <unk> says there.
We're about the live now, and maybe in the time, and maybe we're going to live.
But the most important point is that any thing you're going to do, you're not going to do the other.
The things that we don't have many <unk> that can make less <unk> what we do.
<unk> <unk> <unk>.
I tried to <unk> on my <unk> a new new <unk>.
They're almost always <unk>.
Once the <unk> <unk> were <unk>, and <unk> them, and <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, just after <unk> <unk> <unk> a lot of times, and <unk> a lot of times, <unk> <unk> <unk> a lot of times, <unk>, to go to go.
So, I <unk> a new new when those <unk> were <unk>, and I said, "I need a couple of <unk>, this is my <unk>."
The <unk> <unk> said, "<unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>?"
You want to <unk> or with the <unk>? "<unk>" or <unk>? "" "" "<unk>?
"How do you want to <unk>?"
"<unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk>? <unk> <unk> <unk>," <unk> <unk> <unk>.
I was <unk>, and after a little bit of <unk>, and I want to say, "I want the only kind of <unk>." He had no idea what was, so for a <unk> <unk> <unk>, and then <unk> <unk> <unk>, and then <unk> <unk>, with the best <unk>, and then I had ever <unk>.
It was <unk>.
But <unk> me.
Why? I wrote a whole book for <unk>.
The reason I was <unk> with all the <unk> of the <unk> of my <unk> were <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
I had <unk> <unk> <unk>. I didn't <unk> <unk>. I'm not <unk> <unk> when I just had 100 different different <unk>, <unk>, as a <unk> had to be <unk>.
What I had <unk> was good, but not a <unk>.
And after <unk> what I <unk> with what I was <unk> in <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> of <unk> in life of people don't <unk> the <unk> that these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And this <unk> less <unk>, even when the <unk> are good.
<unk> in the world of <unk> if they <unk>.
Because if you know, you don't know what I'm talking about.
The truth <unk> to this.
"And he was better when he was worse," The reason that was better when he was better when he was <unk> <unk>, it was <unk> <unk>.
<unk>, in the world where we live in -- <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, the <unk> that we can <unk> is that things to <unk> is that things to <unk>.
You've never never <unk> because your <unk>, my <unk>, my <unk>, my <unk>, you're <unk>.
The <unk> of happiness -- what you're here -- is, "<unk>" Yeah, "Yeah, you want."
I mean -- little <unk> <unk> <unk> -- which are really <unk> and my wife is <unk>.
I couldn't have to do better, I'm not <unk>.
But <unk> doesn't always be a <unk> thing.
<unk>, a <unk> of <unk> <unk> when there's just the kind of <unk> <unk> <unk> when you're not just that when you're not <unk>, and you say, "Why?"
"Who is <unk>?" "" "" "" ""
The world is the <unk>. What do I could do it?
When there are hundreds of <unk>, and you're going to <unk> a <unk>, and I'll tell you who is <unk> <unk>, the <unk>, is <unk> that <unk> you.
And I could do better.
With hundreds of <unk> <unk>, there are not <unk> for the <unk>.
So when people do, even if the result is <unk>, you know, you know, they <unk> and <unk> their own own own own.
In the last years, the <unk> is <unk> in the <unk> world.
I think a <unk> <unk> -- not the only, but important -- this <unk> <unk> is not the people have <unk> <unk> because the <unk> are <unk> too <unk>.
And when they have <unk> this situation that the <unk> is their.
So the final result is that in general, we're better better, but we're going to be <unk>.
I'm going to tell you.
This is the <unk> <unk>, what we all do for good and it is not true.
There's no <unk> that a little bit of choice is better than choice, but it doesn't <unk> that much choice is better than choice to be better than choice.
There's a <unk> value, <unk>. I don't know what it's.
But I'm sure we <unk> from a piece of the <unk> level in which the <unk> <unk> our life.
Now, from the point of <unk> -- I've almost been <unk> -- from the point of <unk>, the <unk> is the <unk>.
What <unk> is all this choice in the <unk> is the <unk> material.
There are many places in the world, and you know, <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the problem is not that have <unk> choice.
The problem is that they're too <unk>.
So, the <unk> that I'm talking about is a <unk> <unk> of <unk>, <unk> society.
And that does <unk> and <unk> is this: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. It's a <unk> of money. It's a <unk> <unk>. It's a <unk> of money.
I mean that these choices, <unk> and <unk>, it's not that they're just <unk>.
They're <unk> <unk>.
They do it <unk>.
If a little bit of what in our society <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, where people have too much <unk>, not only their life to <unk>, but also our life to <unk>.
This is what the <unk> call a <unk> <unk>.
A <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the poor -- because of this choice in <unk> that we <unk>.
So, to <unk>: You can become everything you have to be --
<unk>, people, "But what do we <unk> that fish?"
"It's <unk> that can't make anything in a <unk> of the <unk>."
"A <unk> <unk>, a <unk> <unk>, a <unk> <unk>,"
and I <unk> the <unk>, I <unk> so, at the beginning.
But then, <unk>, I realized that that fish is the long <unk> knows.
Because the reality is that if you <unk> in <unk> the <unk>, in the way that "everything is possible" <unk>, "You can't <unk> the <unk>.
If you <unk> the <unk> in the way that we <unk> <unk> the <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, and <unk> the <unk>.
They need a <unk>.
This is almost too <unk>, maybe for the fish, and they <unk> for us.
But the <unk> of <unk> is a <unk> for <unk> <unk>, and <unk>, <unk>, for <unk>.
Thank you.
