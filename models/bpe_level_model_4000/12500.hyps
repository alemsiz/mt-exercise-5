And last year I showed these devices to show these devices that the calotter of the artica, which for almost three million years had the size of 48 U.S. has been stretch of the 408 U.S.
And all of this underpuses the problem because it doesn't show the extract of the problem because it doesn't show the ice of the ice problem of the glacier.
The articket is a certain sense, in a certain sense, the heart heart of the climate system --
You go and slowing and you get return into the summer of summer.
The next next few devices will be a quick for the last 25 years.
The glaciers are signed in red red in red red in red red red in red red by the red bunch of them.
As you see it down to the blue blue blue blue blue boar.
That is the ice in inverns, which is return to summer.
You can see that the ice cosident ice of five years or more, is like the blood of the board.
In 25 years is going to go from this way.
This is a problem because the interesting terrange, the very glacier around the ocean to where there are enormous amount of carbon congelements of carbon -- the money.
It really, to the totality of the atmosphere from global warming, which is that the amount of could double this point of not reporting this point of not relexise to not reach it.
In some deep in Alaska few deep in Alaska is already rebolling from the water.
The professorse Katey Walter of Alaska was a very very short of the Velyor a very short last inver.
Video: Wow! Al Gor: Look is not going to be in us.
A reason is that this scale that this scale scale of the Groenland,
This is a fume to glacier.
And the portraised land,
This is the Kangerlussuaq, in the southern of the Groenland,
If you want to know how to make the level of the sex of the sex of the group, here is where the mare.
These are increasing are increasing very quickly.
And in the other part of the planet: Antarcticket of the planet.
The month scientists have dilarge-dilarity that the while, and that the Antarctic Antarctual of the eye on some isola, which is particularly rapid in the money.
And it was six feet of the water, like in Groenlland,
Sullyaya, the third biggest block of ice ice ice ice ice ice ice -- they see new new laghi, who were glaciers.
The 40 percent of the world's population from the sea pose of the monkey from what money.
South Ande: This glacier is the bottom, the bottom of this city.
The door is increased.
But when it diminupon the same happens.
In California needed on Sierra Nevada is diminuit-percent.
The hydrogen are in crisis.
The previsions, as you have a bunch of me.
The growing growing in the world to a night-to-sexual sed.
The environmental disastring are increasing to a return out of the normal and no previous precedents.
And then the most numbers in the last 30 years of respectent 75.
This is a gandandandandlen.
If you look at the story, if you can see the consequences.
In the last five years we added 70 million tons of CO2 -- 25 million of CO2 -- 25 million tons in the ocean every day.
Look at the Pacification area of the Pacific, from Amer, and the raise of the suburban continent of the subcontinent of the southern of the oxygene in the oceans.
The greatest because of global warming, with the deforestation, which is the 20, is the use of fuel of fuel fuel.
The oil is a problem, and carbon is even worse worse.
The United States are one of the two countries with the most emissions, with the China.
And it was propond of building a lot of carbon carbon.
But we're assisting to change change of direction.
These are the projects of the last few years and some proposites of alternative to be able to be
And every way, there's a political lottta in our country.
The carbon industry and oil industry have spent a 50 million dollars in the last year to promote carbon the bottom, which is a oxymore.
That image I remember something --
Natal, in Natal, in Tennese, where I lived -- 3.8 billion of scale scale of coal.
Maybe you saw it on the news.
This is the second second big flower of scale in America.
It's success around Natal.
The advertie advertie of one of the carbon was this:
Video: Sweather is a kind of cocoal and happy is a kind of like a and happy.
It's abundant here in America, and it makes our economy.
Frosty the carbon is always more cleaner than that.
It's a good praying, adorable, and the work work work are slowing the check of the same.
Al Gore: From the coal of the West Virginia.
The biggest society on the mountain is Massey Coal. This is his friendly. This is his friendly.

So that our priority is to invest a great amount of money in a great amount of money in a sforce to make public and consequence and consequence the carbon the carbon.
In fact, the carbon is not spore.
We think it's clean -- it also has a good profum.
So not prehot.
Let me do us to do us.
Video: Attor: Carbong: Carbond -- you heard a lot of it.
So I do do this in a structure of the sea structure of the carbon is the sea carbon of the sea structure of the carbon --
Straordinary cars are a little wheels are a little wheel.
The main of carbon is between the main of the global warming, but the night-technology of carbon -- that you can see change.
Take a eye is the odiern technology.

Now, there's a new new solution, audace for uscircles.
Real America: 100 percent of clean energy in 10 years.
A plan to report America to work, to make us several reef, and help us to stop the global warming.
Finally, a solution that basts to solve our problems.
Real America. Scover more.

If you want to go back together.
We have to go back to the speak down.
Thank you very much.
And last year at TED I did a introduction on LHC.
And to reach you to the way to give you the way the machine works.
So here is the other time -- and the other time you don't have to the other time -- is the most great experiment -- 27 miles of scientific experiment, or 17 miles of circumst.
His to reach the conditions that were less than a billion of a billion of a billion of second from the beginning of the beginning of the universe -- until 600 million times a second.
And that's just the environment.
This is the car under Ginev.
We do these mini-Big Bang in the rise of the rise of the rise of the White of the White Milg Bang Bang Bang in the sease.
This is what I work. It's called ATLAS -- is called AS -- is 44 meters and has a diameter of 22,000 feet.
This is an picture of ATLATLATLAS in construction so you can notice the proportions.
The 10 sectors we have accesoid the car for the first time.
And this picture was taken from ATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATL.
It was because of immense to the healthy.
It's an image of the first fashion that had done all the around the LHC, entertaining in the LHC, and spread particles in the reaching particles inside the right-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-reaching image
In other words, when you see that image the 10 sector, we understand that the machine works, the machine that the machine is a great living.
I don't know if it was going to make us more opposed to do that when somebody went to Google and lives that the page.
That means that we have a cultural impact on the scientific impact impact on the scientific impact impact on the scientific impact impact impact impact on the scientific impact impact on the scientific impact impact impact impact on the scientific impact impact impact impact on the scientific impact of what scientific impact on the scientific impact impact on the scientific impact of what scientific impact
And then a week later, it was a problem with the machines, it was a problem with these films.
These filming at 13,000 print when the machine works.
Now, the technical of you will look at the movies and did, "It's not true. I'm films. I'm not true.
And instead they can do it because when they are very free cosident cosident cosident films.
So, at least 271 grade, a inferior temperature to that of the space between the stelles, these films, these films, these films, these films.
In one of the most of the most nine in the LHC, there was a dife of flower fabrication.
So the filming of the surrounded up and 13,000 print of suddenly meet a electrical resistence to meet a electrical resistence.
This was the result.
Now, this is still more impressit if you think that these magnets, and that these magnets, and that are snurtures.
They are damamong about 50 magnets.
We had to get them to do that, what we did we did it.
We have repristined and address.
Now they're returning all of their underground place.
Entrue the end of the LHC will be new inteer.
And we acceness, and we expect to get to get the right or or him, and continue to get so our avventure to find what the morning to find out what the universe.
Now, of course, in some way, these are reaccendendent the debate the debate on the value of science and engineering to the defut. It's easy. It's easy.
I think that the fact that it's so difficult to go beyond the limits, I think this is the value, like the things like LHC.
I want to end with the words of a scientist Ingland, Humphrey Davy, the qual, I guys that the inject of his pupill, his pupill, his pupill, his pupill, "Niman is so dangerous to the human mind that ideas of human mind, "Niman is so dangerous how the rate of human brain, which ideas are not the myself in the human beings in the human game of the new than our tries to confidition that our tries to be completely completely completely of our our our our our our our own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own
Thank you.
I want to start to ask you to rethink about how to do you get cooking couraging to the morning.
As you can understand how to reach them and make it and to make them and move them and to think and solve problems to think and solve problems and to think and solve problems and to think and resolving problems and to think and resolve the relationships.
The space is a foundly connected to the way that we understand most of the world around us.
So, by informath inspired by the useful of our interaction with the physical objects with my Pac, and my Jeeveevan Kalanii, I started to ask him: "And when we use a computer, instead of having the site of the mouse of the site that moves on a site that the site polyming that you can move on a little bit of the site to the site with the site of the site interaction,
and to our fundament?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the risk of the risk answer, building Siftable.
And in fact, a Sift-like is a whole whole of a great like a bisco.
And in fact, a Sift-like is a whole whole of a great like a bisco.
You can move with the hand, you can see it with the hand, and they felt the movement and they have a screen and radio wireless and radio wireless and radio wireless and radio wireless to the hand.
But most of course, are physical objects like the morning, you can move to the sleep for the sleep --
Siftable is an example of a new ecosystem for a new ecosystem for a digital information information information information information information digital information.
And as they become several movement, consciously, the same movement, and which, and which, and as they become severververal movement, we can explore and we can explore, and we can explore, and we can explore, and so many different stils of interaction.
He was going to look at a few example.
This is a Siftable to show of the video, if you can even even even in a direction, the rooters of that if you win the other side side side from the other side side side the other side.
These are interactive activities are conscious to others.
If you do them out of it, you are interested in what they are intorn't.
If they come up and you notice and they can get a little bit of it.
If they come up and you notice and they can get a little bit of it.
They also have their movement and including accounted.
And we realize that one of the interesting implications of interaction was the common to use the data, to example of the data, as if it was a color.
In this case, we have three Sift-configured as a several several section of the color in the middle of the color in the middle of the color in the middle of the color of the stranger and I can use them to be able to the strengine of the color and I can use them to be able to the saving of the color of
and I can use them to look at the bottom, where you missed them to the middle of the color in the middle of the color in the middle of the color in the middle of the color in the middle of what you missing it to the color in the middle of what you can get them to the cut into the middle of the color in the middle of the color in
If we can make a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the way.
I'm also beautiful, as a chance of apply and the mathematics and games where people can try and find the things that quickly, and you see the results of the results.
Now I'm --
This is a Fibonacks that I do with a equation-based program.
So we have a game of words that is half of Scarabeo and Boggle.
Pratically, at every turning in the case on the case on every Siftable, Pratically, to every turning of the saves on any case, and as a concert of comporing words he controlling about a dictionary of a dictionary.
And then about 30 seconds of the remiss and you have a new set of letters and new possibilities.
Thank you.
And here's how to the Middle Lab, I did it in the Middle and I did it in the way, and I took a video.
They are pleasure to love.
And one of the interesting things of this kind of application is that you don't have to give you a lot of educational people
You just say, "He," and they know what to do.
Here's how to other people who try it.
This is our better.
It was just just a lot of them.
They were only morning, for him.
Now, this is an apply of a cartoon interactivity.
We wanted to build a tool for the lab of the lingue of the English.
It can insert new characters in the scene, solliant saving the Siftable to their associated with their associated associated with their associated associated with their associated associated with their associated associated with their associated associated with their associated to the Siftunch of their associated in the scene,
It can insert new characters in the scene, solliant saving the Siftable to their associated with their associated associated with their associated associated with their associated associated with their associated associated with their associated associated with their associated to the Siftunch of their associated in the scene,
And here is doing the sun.
Video: The only is a surgence.
David Merrill: Now has brought a treatment.
Video: The treator treat.
Bel work! Yes!
So to school, Siftable and you can make the neighbors can interact the characters --
Video: Bau!
-- by inventing their story.
Video: Hao!
DM: It's a story with opening, and it can decide it as you can decide it as you can decide it as you can decide it as you can decide it as you can decide him as you can decide it as you can decide it as you can decide it as you can decide it as you can decide it as you can decide it as you can decide it as you can do it.
DM: It's a story with opening, and it can decide it as you can decide it as you can decide it as you can decide it as you can decide it as you can decide him as you can decide it as you can decide it as you can decide it as you can decide it as you can decide it as you can decide it as you can decide it as you can do it.
Video: Gulf the gatt.
DM: The last example I have time to show you is a tool, to show you is a tool, to switch and exept to save music.
It's a instrument, I realized recently, to check and exepting music.
Siftable here are acting from suits, like the bottom and bacteria
Every one of these four variations, and you can choose which is use.
You can insert these sounds in a sequence from your pleasure to your please.
And I just want to touch a sound." And a sound."
These are actually that you can control from living and the rivers and the films.
The attacks to a particular sum and then including it.
And then there are the general effects like time and volume, which are apply to the interest sequence.
And let's look at how it works.
Video: Good we will be able to put a basis in two Siftable in two Siftable to a serie, the summer of the summer of the bottom.
Now I put a blow.
Video: DM: Now I add percent --
Video: And I'll put the bacteria, to the bacteria to the bacteria -- so I can control the effect from the living of the living of the living of the living bacteria
Video: I can speak the whole whole to sequence the whole time from a bunch or from the other.
Video: And I'm going to add the bottom to give the bottom to give more expression.
Video: I can recombined the Redwood."
So I don't have to plann, but I can sudden, but I can sudden,
And now, finally, I can sfue the whole sequence of the left Siftable to the Siftable to the Siftable to the Siftable to the whole Siftable to the Siftable to the Siftable to the Siftable to the Siftle.
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is building new interfaces of man-machine -- and more like how to work our brain and the body is.
And today, I had time to show you one of the results of this lost and some possibilities that we try to bring out of the lab of the lab of the lab of this lost of the results.
The concept that I want to transmit is that it's coming this new generation of objects that are going to interact with digital media media in our world in our world in our world in the way we want to do.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the time to talk to all of you.
I'm a writer.
And I sat books is my professional exsion but it's more than that, of course, but it's more than that, of course,
It's also love and the love of my life.
And I don't expect that can change it.
But I said that, something particularly happened recently in my life and in my career and my career that has to be to realive with this work.
The particular thing is that I recently recently, this wheelming called "Mangia, Prega, Prega, Prega, Prega, and different from my fleep and become a great great fedents, and he became a great great -- and he became a big big maker interaction.
And the result is that everywhere. And the result is that they were condness,
It is true -- condness, condnurk --
They go from me to me and say, "You don't have to do it and say, "You don't have to do it for better.
You don't have to keep writing to write for all the life without able to create a book book that can match a book book that can match to somebody's going to make a book a book that can importing to make a book a book that can importing a book that can be able to create a book of a book that can be able to create a book of life without able to make a book a book of life without any more to be able to create a book that life without more than you can do that
that can matter how to somebody?"
It's rassicuring, you know.
But it could go worse -- to me that more than 20 years ago, when I started to say to people -- I was a writing -- I was a write -- I wanted to be a write write to be a write write to be a write write to be a write write to be a writing writing to be a write writing to be a writing to be a writing of a 20 years ago, when I was a writer.
I go to the same insuit from the land.
And people say, "Don't you fore not to have success?
You don't have a paper that the southern kill?
You don't have to do this mestive for all the life without that anything that is ever outside and die of the site to a multi-heart heart with the site of failing to load and failing s?"
So you know, you know.
The answer -- the short response to all these questions is "Yes."
I have a paper of all of those things.
I always had a land.
And I also have a lot of other things that people couldn't have to do it.
As the tree and other things that are slow.
But as a thing about it to write what I thought and I was asked and I asked me to ask me the very why?
Is it rational rational rational it?
It's logic that anyone who who should be smart from a work that you feel sent to be saming to do.
But what is there that particular things in the imprese creative to make sure about the healthcare of the healthcare of the way that other career or not phane?
As my father, for example, he was a chimic engineer and not remember one time in his 40 years of activity where were asked if it was asked if it was asked if it was asked to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer if it was asked if it was asked if it was asked if it was asked if it was asked if it if it was asked if it was asked if it was asked if
It was not -- that block of the engineer John, how do you know?
It didn't work.
Only course, engineers like no imicians like a group of uncertainly in the secouraging the reputation of being alcouraging to be alcourage to be alcourage.
We write enough to have this reputation and not only writers but creatives of every genere, we have this reputation of being enormously substantially instable to be enormously substant.
And it's not another to look at the death of the death of the death of the creative dead that creative -- only in the twention of the two-century, and often often to them.
And even those who don't look like to be really, really, they look at their woman.
Norman Mailer, before I die in the last last but he said, "Look me a little bit more than a little more than a lot of the work of life.
But we don't take the notion of the mind because we have heard of these things so we heard of the long that in some way we have completely interiorized and the notion of the notion that creative and that the art, and that the art, and that the art, and that the art, and it will always be on the hanguy.
And the question I want to bring to all of our today, is you agree with this ide?
And it's good for this thing -- because you look at the way to go from a distance to me not for this supposition.
I think it's odiose.
And I think it's also not to see the perpetuated in the next century.
I think it's better to encourage to live in vivision of creative creative to live
And because I know that in my case -- in my case -- in my case -- it would be very dangerous to be to refugee to that in the constant, and where I'm in my career.
Of true -- you look at least -- I have about 40 years.
I still have about four decades of work in me.
And it's very likely to be like to write that it will be judged by the world as the work that was going to be right after the whole thing that happened after my last book.
He looked at the slave, because we all have -- it's likely to my greatest successful is to my site to my site to my site site to my site site to my site -- it's like.
Oh, Gesooh, that think!
You know, this is the gene of thinking that a person to start to go to the gin the nive and I don't want to do it.
I would continue to do this work that we do.
So, the question becomes up, how do you get to it?
And so so I sat a lot of reflection that the way to work and to work and to create a costructure of a costruck costructure,
I have to find a few way to find a safety of security between me, which is what it written a few of which is that he written up to the time, and I was trying to look through the time, to try to look through the time, trying to find other societies and see if they could have have to look at the time and sex if they could have have their better and more healthcare and more healthy and more healthcare and the way to see if they could have some of the better and
to help people believe that people creative inherent inerssent inersss;
And that research me to the Great and ancient Roome and ancient Room.
See because it gives us in the circle and then you go back back.
Nellellow and the ancestor -- people don't seem to believe that creative creativity that creativity was inspired to man, OK?
It was thought that creative was this spirit to look at the sea and that sea manages of the men from a few surprising and unknown to the distant and unknows.
The grew us called these spirits of creative creativity of creative creativity of creative creativity of creativity --
Socrate, wonderfully creating to have a demon the site that electric heavy.
Romans were the same idea, but they call that the spirit of the spirit of a genie.
The thing is great, because the Romans didn't think that a genius was a particularly intelligence of a particular intelligence of it.
They believed that a genive kind of entity that was living in the site that creating the make, a little like the site of a little like the Melfe Dobby, and that came out of the work of that work and modeling the result of that work.
And it is -- -- -- -- -- -- -- that is the distance of what the site -- that costructure, which protects protected to the result of your work.
And all of them that was so that it was so that it works, right?
So the antic artists were protons from certain things, like the way to the narcixize, right?
If your work was exceptional, you couldn't take it all the mer, all of the mer, all of the deal that you were held to this genive genie.
If your work fail, it wasn't all of the south, right?
And all of them knew that it was your genive to be a inable to be a inable to be a inable to be a inable to be a inable to be a incapable to be a inable to be a inable to be a inable to be a inable to be a inable to be a inable to be a inable.
And so people han concepts of creativity in Ocker for a long time.
And then the Rindate came and all of this great idea; we put this great idea; we put the human beings and no longer to the whole of the and no longer to make a lot of the detail that write of the devices that write from device.
This was the human rational principle and people began to think that creative creative creativity was completely from the iron.
And for the first time in history, you start to reference this or a genius like a genius rather than a person with a genius with the genius with genie.
And I have to tell you a big error.
I think that allows to someone, a simple person to believe that being like a recipient as a recipe of all the mysteries and the surprising and a very much too much to give you a very much too much to give to the fragile of a very big dead to give the human human being.
It's like to ask someone to ingoid the sole.
And I decided to be completely the ego and creating all these ingestible ingestiable to expect on lose performance.
And I think it was this to have destruct the artists in the past-year-old artists in the past.
And, if this is true, and I think that is, and I think it becomes up, and hold it be?
Can we do it different?
And I go back to a more antic of the relationship between human relationship and mystery creative.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we can't get 500 years of thinking about about the concerned in a 18 minutes of 18 minutes.
And probably there are people between the public that solliant would be legitties on the notion of the nice of the nice of the nice of the making of their projects.
And I probably don't have to convince you all about this thing.
But the question I want to bring is -- why is why is it?
Why don't you think about this way?
Because it has more sense of every other thing that ever ever ever heard about to explain the creative process.
One process that you ever have tried to do something -- so fundamentally, all of this -- -- -- yeah, not to be in rational behavior.
And, in fact, you can look completely paranormal.
I did this recently with the Ruth poet Ruth Stone, which has now 90 years, but that has been a poet for all the life and he was a little bit of the life and he was working out of his childhood in the Virginia, and he was going to be in the hair.
He said it was like a fragorous fragorous fragorous fragorous fragorous fragorous fragorous fragorous fragorous fragorous fragorous fragorous fragorous fragorous fragorous fragorous fragorous fragorous fragorous fragorous fragorous fragorous fragorous fragorous fragory.
And that was rotoling to her from the landscape.
It was to get it to get the land below the land below the land below the ground below its feet.
He knew that to have one thing to do that point and it was born, "What, you know, to get it as a morn."
And so it goes to the home and come from this poetpoia, and it would not have to make a piece of carefully and a math enough to take a piece of a card and a lot of the painting and the drug on the page.
Sometimes you can't get enough to be fast, so covery and correct and correct and correct and the rounded without able to get back to the home and she would continue to roll and she would continue to roll through the country.
And then there were no -- this piece of not the dement, I will never -- there were times where the were almost los; right?
So, it was going to go home and he was trying to the car, and he was a make, and he was a make, and he was a swing in the wheel.
And he was the cover from the cold and the reveal was the road to the page.
And in these cases, the poesthem would be presented on the perfect and intaccount but the word at the first word at the first word at the first thing at the first time.
So when you feel that I feel -- it's a crazy of the creative process.
Not all my creative process, they're not a conductle.
I'm a mulate, and my way to work is -- you know, I sweet up to the same order, and to try and get them on the same time.
But even I was the sweep in my head -- I skie on that thing, to you know, you were going to you.
And I imagine that many of you have been done.
You know, even if the work and ideas would come from a certain foundation of a certain foundly saying, I could not be say.
And what is this thing?
And how can we relate to us to do it in a way to do that if you do it to do that?
And so I reveal for me -- the best example that I have is the music that I have is the MeWaits, which I interviewed with a newspaper.
We were talking about this, and you know, Tom, for the magazine of life was the incarnation of the artist of the paper -- to control these species of impull implated, to do these kind of implately internal of the impulsible implated.
But then you get up on the wood, and a day when he was driving on the authod to Los Angeles, it changed all of him.
He was going to go fast, and all of a sea little framework of a melodia, which comes into his head as it makes it as a makes it as a door and the want, and the wish, and the wish, and it doesn't like to take it down.
It doesn't have a piece of car, it doesn't have a matite, has no register.
So it starts to feel this sort of old old old anxian old in him and he said, "I'm going to lose it to the session, and remarrying.
I'm not good enough and I can't do it."
And instead of going to go into the panic stop.
It was going to be the mental process and he did something completely new thing.
And he would look at the sky and said, "He," you know, you know, I wouldn't see that I'm driving the skyppe.
"Do you look at a song song --
If you really want to be going to get a more opport, you get to take a cur.
And I went to importance someone else today,
And I wanted to disturbing Leonard Cohen."
And his work work changed after that.
I don't work with the work as a seed-like it was dark with it.
But the process, and the fishing that was that attornight was releaving when the genius, the genius out of him out of him and the knowledge that he was going to be a whole thing that was going to be a whole thing thing to be something interior what it was a whole thing thing to be a whole thing.
but but he southern this peculie, wonderful bizark between Tom and this thing thing that was not going to lose it was not Tomake was Tom.
So how to feel that story that is to change a little bit of the way I was working and I was already saving and already saving me a time.
This idea, I save when I was writing to write that is the worth of the disperation where we go to work on something and we all when we go to work on something and we don't get to think that it's a disaster, what will be the worse of the worth ever written beat, what the worse bed.
Not just good at the worse book.
And I started to think of that to throw this project.
But then I remember Tom that Tom that you talk about the air and try and it.
So I allow my face on the handle on the handhand. And I would say, my compose to a site of the room.
And he said, "You know, you know, you know, you know, if this book is not going to be brilliant not be the cool will not be the very colate will be cook?
Because as you see it all the thing that had, I don't have more than that.
So if you want to get you to give you a better and do your party.
Okay. But if you don't do it knows what you know?
I'm going to write the same because it's my work.
And I would like to do it was recorded to do my part that I was to do my part -- because of the end is that -- the end of the North Africa in the deserts of Africa -- the end of the North Africa and music and music and music and music that were going to go and the music and the sacting to the tree to the tree and the sacand.
And they were always magnificent because the ballers were fantastic professionals, and they were fantastic.
But every tant, I think, something happened, and one of these artists became actually actually translate in fact, it was actually translate in the fact that they were actually transending.
And I know what you talk about what I know about that, because I know you saw all of the way, a certain point, a lost of them like this.
It was like the time you stopped and the ballery through a sort of portal portal and was not doing anything from the sun, as the 1,000 nights, but all of the one night;
And suddenly not like a human being.
But you acceptese in the dead of the divinity of divinity.
And when this next time was to the time -- people knew what he was -- they call it it it with his name.
They were the hands and start starting to cant, "Allah, Allah, God God, God God, God, God, God, God."
That's God, you know,
And the note of historical -- when Morder, the south of the Spagna, they predict this abitude with them and the will, he changed in the Phh," and "Oh, yet, "Wah, y," which you can feel in the corries or in the corries or in the corride or in the corride or in the corride or in the corride or in the corride or in the Spapers.
In Spay; when a artist has done something impossible and magic -- "Allah, magnifi, house, "Thah, magnifie, -- one of God.
And it's great because we have to do it.
But the problem comes the problem comes later, for the baller's same, when you sweather and discover the 11 of the Martedge, and last last of Dr. Martedge, is not more.
It's just a mortal with a great male of the knee, and maybe not will ever ever be able to make it more to each other.
And maybe nobody will give the name of God still as the game of his lives?
It's difficult.
This is one of the most pathful to make it in a creative life to make a creative life of creative to do in a creative life of creative account.
But maybe not to be so much to be so angotis; it doesn't believe that it is to be so extraordinary of your being from you to yourself.
But credit you just get to the prestate from a inherable image of this team of this team that team of your life that you have to get to somewhere when you get up to someone else when you get up to somewhere you have to come to somewhere you have to go to somewhere to do anyone one of your life that is going to be in the constant,
And, you know, if we think of this is all change.
And so I started to think about it, and it's because it was a lot of how I thought for several for several working on the book that I will be prestant, except to the very success.
And what I have to keep to say when I feel like to say when I feel elected by this is, not to be away.
Not just just your work.
Continuy to present, to your party, any can be anybody can be.
If your work is salling, bally.
If the divin, the devent of assumpting the delight-up to a few kind of wonderful to a moment through your own own your sforce to your sforce your sforef and then "Ok!"
And I did the same thing to your dance.
And "Ok!" And I said, "You know,
I believe I was to teach it.
"Yes!" I mean, even even for the human beings and the human heads and tests to make it presenting to keep on the swild:
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
As you know I've been talking about some of these projects on the human genome on the genome of the discovery of genes.
We're starting a new percorn: We started to digitalize the biology and now to start to that code the digital code of the biology, we are in a new fasking.
We always have to make great questions.
What is the vite of the lives I think have to be a lot of biological biological chairs of the lives.
We tried several approach, reducing the minimum to the minimplements.
We're digitalize by almost 20 years ormas.
When we sequenced the human genome was treated to the world from the analogical world of biology to the digital world of the digital computer.
Now we can regenerate life, or create a new life from this universe from this universe from this universe to digital digital universe ?
This is the map of a small organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, which is the species from genome genome of the genome of the most of the genome can be able to the lab.
And we tried to reduce the genome to create a little smaller to create a little smaller to create a little bit more little it.
We can get to eliminate a hundred center centinaie centinaid.
But when you look at his map methabolic map of metabolic map to the nostrength.
And I believe, this is simple.
But when you look at all the genes that we can eliminate to the time, it's very imlikely to take a cellula to a cell cellula to the live.
So we decided that the only only to progret was synthesize this chromobile to make the cool to make the component to some of these fundamental questions to bring some of these fundamental questions
And so we started the avventure of "Can we can synthesize a chromost?"
Can you feel that to produce these great molecules that we have never been able to create before we have to create before to create before you get before to create before the or?
And, in case of the way, can we make a chromost?
A chromosomes is just a piece of chemical material matter.
The speed with which we are able to digitalize life is growing up to reach the increase of the increase of the increase is to exponential life is growing up to the life is growing up to the life is growing of the increase is to be able to a life life is growing to reach the life is growing to reach the life is grow
Our ability to write code code code code code and rather slowly, but it's improving.
And our most recently, the results of the site curve.
We started more than 15 years ago.
The process has required a lot of pass to a bioetic revision before we start the first experiments.
But we found out that DNA is very difficult.
There are decades of thousands of the world that produces are small segment of DNA, the 30s of the 30 to 50 letters reads and it's a degenerative process, the most of the segment is long, more mistake --
So we had to develop a new method to assemble these frames and correct the errors.
And this was our first attempt to start to start to start to the digital information of the Phi 174.
It's a small virus that kills bacteria.
We designed the framatic correct of the reeffort of the errors and get a molecules of about 5,000 letters.
The interesting part of this is when we took this piece of chemical material material material and we insert it into the bacteria began to read this code and proprices the chemical code and propricing the vires.
The particles have been released by the cells, they go back and they go back and they have been released the E.
I talked about recent with members of the oil industry was saying that their own that they have certain pattern.
They have a more than you.
We believe that this is a situation where the software can really build his own own hardware in a biologist.
But we wanted to do the biggest things in the biggest thing.
We wanted to build the whole chromosome.
I'm more than 580 milles.
So we thought that building it in the cassette of the size of the virus, so that you can change the cassette to understand what the component cellula to understand what the site of a cellula to figure out what the save.
The design is crucial and if we start with the digital information in a computer, these have to be very accurate.
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 the standard was a error.
We have discovered that 30 mistake -- 30 errors. If we had that we had that would be able to do it work.
A part of the process is to design sitting 50 letters bees that are swrapping with all the other other segment to build subunity to build subunity to build subunity that to work together.
Let's try to look at the one here.
You probably have to be a sleck of the flight.
That, think of this is a code code code on four letters: SS, G: A and T.
To of those letters with about 20 love with about 20 love love 20 love love to 20 love to reading for every love to the lamminos.
So we can use the genetic code to write words, fraise --
What we did we do to do it was autography.
Some were dolphins from the fact that it wasn't a wheel.
We designed these segment to just just unize with a sudden.
There are sustain't get them and make them assumption.
And we started to get to sell to the star, beginning with five to seven miles, the unends to form to form to form to form to get 72 miles to get 72 miles to get 72 miles of the letter to get 72 miles.
And every past we have produced these sitting in the abundance so that we are trying to create a proception of creating a proceing proceing in a minute.
We're trying to automatizing the process.
So, this seems the tabellow of a player of a flow.
When we get to these very long segment segment segment segment -- they don't grow to be directly in E.
It comes to the limb of modern biology of molecule.
So we look at other mechanisms.
We knew about another mchchchchanking called recombination recombination of biology is to reparate DNA to reparate DNA to reparate the DNA to report the segments.
Here's an example.
This organism, called Deinocock-lended radioast, it can make three million radiation.
You can see in the riddanger as his chromosome.
In 12 -- 24 hours is reassembly like it was before.
And there are thousands of organisms that are able to do it.
And these organism can check up a while.
They can live under a vace.
I'm absolutely sure life existing in space, and you slow to find new environments of water.
And I mean, NASA showed that this avene.
This is a picture of the molecule that we have built these approaches with the light-re-to the remarkable to inserious design of inserious segment to inserious to inserious with the inserious design of inserious segment to inserious with the inserious design of the segment of the segment of the segment of
The light-slow-automatically.
This is not been taken with a microscope with a microscope with a microscope of rule.
It's a molecule that we can see the great that we can see the with a microscope of law.
These are pictures that cover a period.
This is the advertis; we did a lot of time ago.
They're more than 58,000 letters of code code code code code of code code code code of genetic code code of code code code code code of code code code code of genetic code code code code of genetic code code code of genetic code code code code code
It's the molecule of a definitely construction of a definitely construction of the human structure of the human structure of the most of the most of a definition.
It has a lot of a 300 million to 300 million people.
If you stamp it with a 10 without spaces, you would like 142 pages would like 142 pages only to turn this code code this code code of this genetic code --
Now, how do we work? How can we activity that?
Of course, tramp is a game from a guy guy who is a guy from girls.
It's a little bit more complicated when they use bacteria
It's simplest when it's about the eucary cells like our names like our names as our remarkable cells, which is basically the nuclear process of receive to each other, which is basically the process of return.
In the bacterium is instead of the cool is instead of integrated inside the cell, but we have recently showed that we're able to do a trailing trailing to a and other and activity to a different and activity of activity.
We can can refounded a mote cooking from a microbial coal.
The two are different as men from topies.
We have added some genes in the way to decide which you can decide where to chromost.
And it has a cheap with the inches to killing all the protects of the protects protection.
And when we put it into the cellula was stupending -- and you can appreciate our graphic defice is the new site -- the new romosome,
And we were thinking that we couldn't go to the tit, but we have property to save us more in the slower in the less.
This is one of the most mecting of evolution.
We found that very much species have added a second or a third of a third of a third of a few party, I add in a second thousands of new trats to that species.
So who think about evolution as a only gene gene to the time that you have no understanding of the biologist.
And there are the immestimate called "restriptional restrips.
The romosomes that was in the cellula doesn't have a one.
The cell--tak-tail-tail-up that we inserito-tail ha.
It is expressesed, and it has recognize, as a material material as a summer material as a matter of the summer and the new romost.
It became blue because of genes that we have inserable.
And in a short of time, all the characteristics of a sort of a sort of a sort of a sort of a new software that we insert in a new software that we insert in the phone.
All the protects are changed, members are changed, and when we legiving the genetic code of what we have transference.
Now, this might look like genetic alchemy alchemical alchemy alchemy of the software are in a enough replace.
Now, I already explaned that that you don't talk about genes; but of progress -- but of the three million years and a half of evolution, and I said that maybe we're going to create a new version of Cambrian explosion of this digital process.
Why do you do that?
I think it's obvious when we think of our necessity.
We're going to go from six billion and a half billion people in the next 40 years.
Just to give you an example: I was born in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for every one existing in 1946; 40 years, there will be a quack.
We're going to find out the problems now to find food, water and clean for six billion and buck for six billion and a half a half billion people.
It will be still do it for nove billion.
We use more than five billion carbon carbon than 30 billion boundaries.
That means millions of bariles.
When we try to find out biological process, or whatever you know, a process of remarkable process is a huge challenge to be a huge challenge of a huge challenge of the process to report this kind of huge process,
And we have to get all the most of the CO2 from these materials that end up into the atmosphere.
And in the day, thank you to the scientific discovery in the world, we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I like to think that are the component for the future.
The electric industry is just a dozen of components, and think about how many things are seven.
Our limits here are these principles of reality and from our imagination.
Now we have some techniques of these rapid metoes of synthesization, can create what we call a genomic metaphor.
We can build a big robot that can produce a million chromosomes to the day.
Think of these 20 million genes of different genes or to try to get the way to produce either and make a little bit more biologists, new vaccines, we can change a little theam, and create a little theam, and create a little more biologist of the past 20 years of science.
And it's just a standard.
We can choose to survive to survive, production or carbon vaccines of vaccines to be accines.
This is an instantanea few software programmed to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to sell and designing species to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to sell and design species to be able to be able to searching and designing species to be able to able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
Well, we don't know that it would be like to be year.
We know exactly what their genetic code code code code code code code code code code code code code code code code code code.
We're now focusing on the carbon of the generation.
You also saw you see that summer from the grass from the grased experiment was an experiment with the final experiment was an experiment with the final experiment was an experiment with the grass.
We have carbon on on a third generation that will use enough to be price of the highest drug to the highest of the highest or different types of thrown --
But the only way the biology can have a great impact can have a great impact the cost of food and limiting the cost of the availability, and we are working for the prize, to which we are working for designing the whole thing that we can reach this purpose to the first carbon of the first carbon about 18 months.
The only light with CO2 is a metodoor -- but in our discover all the world, we found different methods.
This is an organism that we have described in 1996.
It lives in the deep ocean to about 2500 meters of the temperature of the water.
They create metate from CO2 molecules of energy.
We're trying to figure out if we can inch the CO2, which can easily translate that CO2 in the site tube, to drive this process.
So we think of a short we might be able to increase what the basic question of "What is the vita," which is Noi, the way, we have the modeal of respect to report the whole industry.
Well if you can't do it from TED, where pull?
It would be a main of energy.
And we are working for using the same methods to create vaccines to create vaccines to create vaccines
You saw this year with the influence, we're always backed to a year and a year in less when it's about to find the right vaccine the right right here.
I think what you can change in the anticips.
And here's how the future might start to look like to change now, the tree of evolution, accelling evolution, accellow the synthesic with bacterium cells, and infinally cells.
We're so so so from improving people.
Our purpose is to make enough to live enough to try to make it a lot of a lot of you can do it for a lot of it.
Before all you can see the fastest as as we can see the fastest as a fundamental fundamental quease in the quizing a year -- it's a year -- that's a year -- this is Seadragon.
It's a environmental environmental where you can interact is to the local level that is a huge amount of data that is a huge amount of data.
We're seeing a lot of giant phigigabyte of a picture of a kind of a zoom and continue, for a speaking and continue, and for a fast breakes.
And not matter how big the amount of information that we see how big the amount of information or the things or of data or the imagines.
Most of most of the camera of digital photographs, but this is a provide from the Big of Congress, and reenter in the legal legal game, and reenter in 300 megapixel.
It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that the prestations of a system like this is the number of pixel on your screen in any moment. It's also an architecture of a very flexible architecture.
This is a book of data doesn't imagine how to do you don't imagine how to imagine it doesn't imagine it.
This is the Casa desolated of Dickens. Every colonna represents a capitulum to a capitulum --
And to show you that is just just a head and not imagines, we can do something like to see that that is a real representation of the head, not a fair.
It could be a little artificial to read a little artificial book.
Not you don't have to address.
This is a more realistic example of the Nardian.
Every very image is the beginning of a century.
And it really gives you the beauty and beauty the version of a reversion of a review of a fix a review of a quotidie, which is for a very simple theat, which is for a very a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a suck of a rely fair.
We also did something with the corner of this number in this particular number of of Lardian.
We created a fashibble addition to solve solving -- much more than that you use in a normal normal -- and we insert in a normal contex.
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile, you can see here.
Or other models, or even the specific specific fixes
And this really demonstrate some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on the screen.
And we hope that this gentleminally to the pop-up and other six-million to be to need to be necessary.
Naturally, the map is one of the most of the most obvious appropriate for this kind of technology.
And on this isn't going to say that we don't want to say that we have contributed to give it in this field.
These are all the streets in the United States in the United States of NASA.
So now we go to something else.
This is actually from the journey on the Web -- you can see it.
This is a project called Photosynth, which fights two different technologies.
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual research to a very interesting visual computer towards in Noah Snavely, a student of Steve Seitz of the US and Rick Szelii of Microsoft Research Szelii of Microsoft Research of Microsoft Research Snavign Resear.
And it's from the journey to the web, managed by Seadragon.
You can see that when we do this kind of pattern, where we can go from an image to a picture of the other and have this kind of experience of experience.
But the space, the space collection of the images here has actually a meaning.
And the site algorithms of the computer have recorded these pictures together, in the way that the correspond to the reactive places. And that the slaghi Grases on the Mountains of the Mountain of the Mountains -- you were taken -- and all you see the sandle of a slide of a de-show of the whole whole thing that you're all link of the space.
I don't know if I have time to show you some other environment.
And there are a lot more space.
I want to go directly to one of the Noah-- and this is from a precedently from a Photosynths that we have done to work for the first time the time -- to show you what I think is really the chief, to show you what the hotyth. And it's not necessarily the gone of the Photyth. And it's not necessarily so that we have to the environments that we have to look at the Web
We had to worry about the legal aspects and so on.
This is a reconstruction of Nots Dame images of Nots Dame images from Flickr. Basta Flickr in Flickr and you get images of the camps, and you get images of these around, and you say, a picture that the arranges to represent.
So I'm all sorts of Flickr and have been all connected to the space in this way.
And it's possible to navigate in this simple way.
You know, I never thought I would end up to work for Microsoon.
It's very gratify to get this kind of a lot of it.
I think that it's a lot of different fairs of fairs of fairs of the photo's photo's professional professional of the SLR, a number of different fairs in this environment.
And if you can try to try and those more strange.
Many are block to do it cket down.
Some of them here is a series of photographs -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
This is a Notber of Notber Dame recorded coat.
We can go from the sea physics of this environment.
The essential point is that we can do things with the social environment. This is now taking data from everyone to the other other things from all of these things that are doing the ground of how to all those data together.
All those pictures become connected together, more than the sum of the sum of the way of the sex.
You've got a model of the entire that emerge.
Think about how to Stephen Lawler Lawler on Earth in virtual Earth in virtual Earth virtual
It's something that grow up in complexity to the people who use it and the people who use for the uses will increase with the use.
Their pictures are snurses from other people.
If somebody comes the idea of a contrast of all these sants say the name, my photos, my photo's image of Nots of all of those dates, and I can use it as a point of the site to immerge, and in that that methaping the way of everywhere, and to have a lot of the body and have a lot of experience of the kind of a few of the bulk and to have a lot of the kind of like this.
Natural consequence of all of the most of all of the most of the most of the most of the Earth, that you don't only only see from the plane and satellow and satellitaries and satellitary memory and satic memory and skin.
Mille thank you.
Chris Anderson: I understand good? What your software you going to feel about to do is that in some point, in the next years, all of the pictures of the world or will be connected to everyone in the world or will be connected together?
BAA: Yeah. What is doing is basically to discover it.
It's a creating of the hyperlink, if you want to imagine hyperline.
And it's doing it in the basis of imagines.
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the recicipe of the seed-of the several information that many of these images can be able to be a very interesting thing if you think about these images of the seedons.
As when you make a research of images on the website, you know, a fit on the page, and the site on the page, in the picture.
Now, what happens if that pictures you connect to all your fall?
So the amount of interconnection and the amount of seedity and the amount of remarkable that is really enormous of the remarkable of the reef.
CA: Blaise, it's really incredible.
B: Thank you very much.
One of the main of the main and one of the inner of the inner search is the way to live between who who didn't forget, the way to live between who who has been in the wind, the wind, the wind the wind, the switch into the wind of the today, the sleeping in the founding in the flows in the facing today, the gate of the site and love to lovel the gate of the site search between who is in the gate of the gate of the gate of the saving of the past of the past of the site of the site of the site sesel of the s' s' s' s
Basts think that the sciamans still still still the beyond the end of the Battay, or that the mestors are still colming the British of the Mr. Inuit in Himalaya, the good at the Dhar, to remember the main the Dhar, to remember the importance of the modern of the South of the world that the whole world that the whole thing that the world in absolute of reality, but it's just a model of reality of reality, but it's just the model of the mad,
the consequence of a particular constitutes of adapted that our stirs has done or -- many generations ago.
And, of course, we all share the essential trates.
All we all hidden we all for.
We're dreams to remaintaination.
We have to deal with the inesorability, so we don't take us and whales --
We all have a art.
What it is the particular of the canzone, the rhythm of the dance of every culture.
Not matter that are Penan forests of the Borneo, or the following of Haiti, or Haiti, or the Haiti, or the South Seping secentries in Kenya sect in Kenya sector, or a camp in the heart of the Sahara.
He was my company of my journey in the desert a month ago, or a yak of the Middle of the Qomom, on the Mounder of the world.
All of these people teaching us that there are other ways of thinking about there are other ways of thinking about it, other ways of that we can move in the world.
And, if you reflect a time, is a conception that can give you a concept.
Insiem, the miridgges of cultures of the world creating a spiritual spiritual and cultural cultural and it's important for the planet and it's important for the human being.
And you can think about this rail-like like like a netnosfer and you can call the sum of all of the concepts, and it can call the sum of all the concepts of all of the concepts, intuitions of being from the human consciousness from the human consciousness from the human consciousness.
The etnosfast of human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human issue.
It's the symbolic of what we are and what we can be in how much inquise.
And because the whospher's been consumed as a sex as it was very quickly.
No biologist, for example, it would be 50 percent of all the species was or is about the summer -- because it's just a fake -- in the size of the biological issues -- in the size of biological diversity -- and you don't have to be a little bit of a lot of the ipottery -- that of the most cultural of the diversity -- that of the most cultural.
The indicates all of this is, of course, the language language.
When you're born 6,000 lings.
One language is not just a game or a vocabulary or a series of a series of a series of rules.
One language is the prap of human spirit human spirit of human spirit of human spirit of human spirit of human spirit of human spirit of human spirit of the human spirit of human spirit bed.
It's the half of which animate of every cultural in the material in the material.
Every language is a forest, a forest, a site thinking of a sum chance to be a spiritual chance to spiritual spiritual ches.
And of those 6,000 langues, as we are here to Monterey to the half is not more sushed in orecke, in the oreckers and children.
They don't get to teach the children, which means less than the camp -- that is already dead -- that are already dead to die.
What is a more tristage of being the silench of being the last to talk about a language, of the last to talk a language of the address or of the addres?
This is a few of somebody in some of the world in some of the world every two weeks of the two weeks and a little bit of a few weeks of a site language of a language of an ant.
And I know somebody who who will say "Is it better than that?
The world would be a better place if we talk to all the same language of the same language of the same language -- we talk all yoruba. Parlim we have a cantone:
We talk about kogi.
And you will be a tract thing that means not to talk about their language.
I would like to do a journey through the ethnosfer.
a small journey in the etnosfast of what we're losing to be able to give you a sure.
Many of us say that when I say "different ways of existing very different ways of existing different ways of existing different ways of existing different ways of existing in the different ways of existing different ways of existing of us that when I say "different ways of there are very different ways of there to existing into exist.
So let's take for example, this bimb Barasana, Amazony secentrional of the anacony, the popular of the site of the site of the site of the site of the sepent of the seping of seping the sacries.
It's a population that is not able to distinguish, the blue color because the time the site is identify in the forest of the forest, which depends the population of the population.
They have a strange language and a strange of a matheme rule of language -- "Heogamy language -- that is a different language of language.
And it has a radical step in the past-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-sex-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to
They are just listening and then they start talking about.
So let's take one of the most interesting tribes with what I lived -- the Waorororan incredible population of Ecuador norial population that has had the first contatelements in 1958.
In 1957 five mission have attaccount a constant mistake a constant.
They did a high photographs that they would reach them in a few that they were loved in a few that that people who were loved in pluvial pluvial of pluvial pluvial bi-dimensional bi-dimensional bi-dimensional bi-dimensional b-dimensional to-dimensional to-raissues that they were in the high pluvial of the forests had never seen anything of bi--dimensional raissues that they would have seen in the plud of the plud of the size of the plud of the plud of the size of
They collected the pictures of the search to the research of a form or a flow, they have a flowing of the diavoid and they killed the five mission with the site with the slances.
But Waorans don't have to killer the straniers.
They killed between them.
54 percent of the mortality was causing their stessi.
We are slow-generations and we found two of natural death of natural more, and when we insisted to saper, they had a of their own again that was again to be again that is dead again that is dead again to the same thing.
The catts were able to recognize the animal from 40 pass and recognizing the species.
In the first '80, was a very interesting compiece, when my first extract when my first first of Harvard to me to go to Haite, I would go to the basis of Duval society and Tonton Macoute, and the Tonton Macoutes of the valizes and the Tonton Mawon the weline of the valive.
To make sense of miracke, I should have to understand the Voun and that Voodom is not a black black is a black black is black black of the mirack.
It's quite a nice of a metaphor of the world.
A lot of interesting.
If you ask you to tell me the great religions of the world, what would you say, what would you say, "What would you say, "What would you say, "What would you say, "What would you say, "What is you would say, "What would you say, "What would you say, "What would you say to tell me the great religions of the world, what would you say, "What would you say, "What would you say, "What would you say,
Cristianity, Islam, Buddget, Ebraism, Ebraism, eter.
A continent is always leaving out that Africa sub-Saharan Africa has no religious fairs and Voodom and Voodom and Voodom is not that the distilled of these concepts of these of the slavery in the slavism of the slavia.
What makes the interesting is that the kind of voodoor is the intenter of life and more.
So you live to give you the spirit.
And the spirits can be invoccurred by Grand, respond to the return of the dance and replace, and they replace, to the site that for a short to a short to a short that to a short to the goal becomes the going.
So this voodookists to say "Ves white you go to close to speak about God.
We get the way to get Di."
And from the moment that you are the spirit that drive, how can you do you get you to the male?
So you get these incredible events -- that is the voodoor in the state of trends that touch touch of infuels that touch of the power of the power of the mind of the power of the mind of the mind of the mind of the body in a state of a state of a summer.
And in all the people with the most extraordinary of the most extraordinary of the Sierra Nevada Santa Marcket in Santa secentrional secentrional secentrional sector.
It will be the samp of civilization, that once lived on the careboard of the Colombia in the conquist, the population of the conquist, the population that was the massive massive massive massive site that the pigain on the carbaic of the carbe.
In a continent continent of health, this population never been conquented from the site continent to the site to the site continent.
And in the today, they have governed from a clack but their formation is decided.
The young following are door three or four years, and they live in a few years, and they live in a factory world of buyster and blows in a factors for 18 years.
Two periods of the nove years of proposing the nove names of the nine of the nine that will turn into the utter of the mother, are metaphor and Mad's ads.
And so this time, they get acculturing to their society, values that they predict that their presit and only their presit and only their presit -- or to the cosmic equilibrium -- or to the best equilibrium -- or to the ecologic equilium --
And at the end of this incredible beginning, they suddenly brought up and the first time in the age of the first time in the age of the first time -- and in that that activity of the first balls of the first balls of the beautiful beauty and all that they learned in the theory is speed in the theory comes into the talks of his splend. The predent of this incredible started.
"Well as I have a detail.
It's stupend. Now it's now to you protect it.
They call the greatest frates and say that we are the minds, we are the colpe-frates of the world.
This level of intuition is extremely important.
When we think of the populations and the environment, we invote Rousseau and the old story of the noble of the noble noble concept in his simplicity or maybe in his simplicity or maybe we look at the Earth of us to the Earth are neighbors to the Earth of us to the Earth of us to the Earth of us to the Earth of us to the Earth of us.
The popular population isn't feeling nastonishing from our own own our tregic from our our own own our tregic of our own nast.
There's no space for these things in the malaries of the Asm, or in the windows of Tibet, but thank you to the time and return to the concept of the Earth -- not on the concept of being consciousness of being consciousness that the Earth can live only be because it's the most underneath is the way to live because it's infected by the way to be the infect: the idea that the Earth can live only beyond of the Earth-up in the Earth
What does it mean to that?
It means that a guy who is a girls that a guy who grow up that the mountain is a spirit that the right is going to be a human being being a human being being a human being being a human being. And it will have a fun to a lot of a young young young to the mountain that place to grow and creating a mountain is a site of a rock that a mountain to be a sleep.
That is the dead of a spirit or a cut is irriright-up is irrish.
What is interesting is is the metaphor that defines the relationship between individual and the natural world and the natural world of natural world.
I grew up in the forests of Columbia credating that the forests were going to be cut.
And it has a human beinger to be a different from my friends Kwauth that creating the forests are the forest of Hukukuk and the bears that live in the world and the nurs that live on the world, and the nice that live in the world of the spirits that are in the Hamatatsa.
If you start to look at that these different cultures can create reality reality to create some of their sensitive discovery of sensitive conditional discovery of the sense.

Maybe some of you have heard of the ayahuase, the most powerful replace, the most powerful psychamanic of the repsynthesic red.
What makes the fascinating is not the potential potential to make it make, but his elaboration. It's composed to two elements.
And then a bunch of a bunch of a series of a series of beta-carbon and harmine and harmine and harmine moline, and harmind, and laws.
I take the only piant that you have a filled filled that alters a little bit of the coscies, but it's measure with the flows of a bunch of a coffee of the coffee of the coffee of a coffee of a coffee.
This is a contious potent triptages very simiar to serotonine, a methoxypt-methoxypt: 5, methoxypt.
If you ever see the Yanomami from the birth of the nose that are doing from a different set of species, anchoxydithoxydithoxydithoxydithoxypts.
Tiring that poles on the hidden is a little bit like being disappeared by a slup of electricity and landing on a sea to the electricity. Rism doesn't make a distortion of reality of real; it creat.
I was often with my professor, Richard Evan Shultes, Richard Evan Shultes, the man who has been the psychopic discovery of the covery of the 30s, in the '30 in Mexist.
Second my toxes can't be classing these tript-like like like a slow beyond because if you're done not to tell any of being slowed in order to be sure. And it can't be suck because they're drug because they're dramatically of course, because they're dying.
It is possible to assummers only if you get with other substances that denaturate the MAO.
Now is the beautiful beta-carbon that are in this booana are injected in this booana are inflat, the same kind of potentiate to potentiate the triptamines. The question of available to be able to be two delight?
We use the great eufemism of proof and the error, which can revealing infrutt;
But if we ask Indians will tell us "Bly."
What does it mean to that?
This tribe, Cofan, has 17 variety of ayaways, which distinguish, that distinguish, and that our eyes would go into the same species.
If you ask how to be able to be able to say "Their will tell us how to do it to be able to the piece, the rest of the no?" I said, "No."
The solution, it's taking 17 variety in a night of a nice of a bunch of a bunch of a different tremendous and each one of the ground with a different type of a different type of a nice and each one of the night of a bunch of a night of a nine of a night of a bunch of a night of a bunch of a nice of a night of a bunch of a night of the land,
And with this is not a Harvard, but it's very much more interesting than contare to contare the stames.
Now, the problem is that also the problem is that also the ones of us who have to heart the population of us who have to be painting them out of the history of the story of the respect of the history of our respecta.
In fact, 300 years, not will remind for the 300 years, not will remind or his innovations of the technologies or its innovations of technology, but rather like it was where we are stopped and we activity or accepted to the mass of the mass of the mass of the planet here. Now not change. Now the problem is the change. Now the problem is the change. Now the problem is not the change. Now the change
All cultures through cultures have been involved in a dance to a dance of life.
And the problem is not technology.
Indian Sioux have no sex -- when they put from the site and fresh and fresh and fresh so like Americans have no matter to be Americans when they put from the horse and calculations.
It's not the change or technology that threats the integrity of the etnos; it's the poord.
The hard fly of the domination.
And if you give you a look at the world, I find that these are not destined to disappear.
They're creatures and dynamics and dynamics out of the existence from the existable to identify their own capacity to adaptation of addition.
And I think that you get disbodies in the pathride of Penan:
a notion of Saraway, in the site of the site population that has been a population of the forests in the forests to a generation of a generation -- and now reduce to the refumic of the refume to see the fiume that seems to see the Borney or Meria, where the slower of the Meria, where the navailable the site the the site the site the navail.
It takes to reach the stand with the subtrack.
Obbbbe, in the case of Yanomami, are the diseases that are come with the discovery of the discovery of the discovery of the discovery of the diseases that are the discovery of the diseases that are the discovery of the sleep,
If we move on on on the Tibet, where I'm doing a lot of research, where I'm doing a lot of research, you see the last voltion of political domination.
As you know the genocide of a population of a population of a population of a population of a universal population, but the instrument of the life of a population of a population of a population of a population of the sea population of developing strategic strategy.
And you can't understand the Tibet Tibet until it comes from the beginning.
I lost the 6,000 miles from Childu in Chinese Coccial through Tibet through the Tibet with a young line, but only came to a young line, but only got to the thing that we heard what there's the statistics of which we heard what we heard about to feel about it.
6,000 monugments, and cut into the poles and energy.
1.2 million people killed by measure in the Cultural Right?
The dad of this guy was assumed to the Panchen Lama.
The one that means that it was killed to the time of the invasion of the Chinese invasion of the Chinese invasion that was killed to the time.
Sant's sounds with Santity in Santity during the diaspora that has brought the population in Nepal.
He's been imprisoned and his colping was to be real.
It was brought to the age of two years from the age of two years from his gonna because it could not live without him.
The surprise, that he did it was in the field of reedue.
A day has been calculated a fassumer of a fashion Mao or and this transgression, was to be able to work for seven years.
Tibet of Tibet can be inhilable, but the spirit of the population is from tend to be inject.
And then it reduces a choice.
We want to live in the world of the mootony of the world's world's policy of the diversity of the diversity of the diversity of the diversity of the diversity of the diversity of the diversity of the diversity of the world's world's world's monoccurrenty of the world's worldwill?
The big ancestimate Margaret Mead, before the most of the most of the most of the size of the most of the size of the world -- not only to see the whole legal of the human imagination of human imagination of human imagination to a few more chunk of thinking to a little bit of a suddenly to a sweat at the way to be able to the way to be able to the way to be able to see that that there were other choose to the whole of the way to the way to be be able to see that they will go to the lose to the until the whole of the other other
And it's humor to remember that our species is existed for 600,000 years old.
The Neolitic Rivolution that has gives us the agriculture, which has done us to the covery of the seed-up the seeding of the classroom and we talk about the gerarchia of the classroom and speaking of the specialization, and we talk about 10,000 years ago.
The modern world industryzed has 300 years old.
That is not suggests that we have the risk of all the challenges that we have to deal with the challenges that we will have to deal in the millenior of the challenges that we have to deal with the challenges that we have to deal with the challenges that we have to do in the millenenia.
When these people at these cultures of cultures of the world is asked to be human human beings, they respond to be human with 10,000 different of them.
And it's in these answers that we all have the chance to be what we are sex: a sort of a conscious kind of a conscious way that all of the giving and all the giving us a lot of optimism.
I took this picture of the north of the island of Baffin, when I went to the whales of the whales with Inuit, and this man -- and he told me the wonderful story of his grandmother.
The government government is not always gentlems with the Inuit and the '50s to stabilize our sweeting our sound, we have them in colonies.
The grandmother of this man refuted to go to the way.
The family for his life, he took all the arms, and all of his attaccounts.
You have to know that Inuit doesn't temt the free -- the snest.
The pattines were made of the site in the site of the site in the site of the caribs.
The grandfather of this man didn't do it by the night from the night of the nice that has been doing it.
It's sleeping a while, you know, pantalongs, in the site of the site and defected in their own own hand. When the I did a lam.
It has been salive on the points on the site of this wheef and when they come up and when they come up with a dog --
He was schooled with a brillier, and created a brillier, with the cassroom created a slittle, and it has been slowing another dog on the bankking, and it was slowing in the restaur.
We want to talk about to the hold with nientertains, and this in different motors, Applausily is the symbols and all the population of the population of the world.
In 1999 government government government government has reduced to the Inuit to the total control of a total area of the largest of the California and Texas a lot of the Texas well.
It's their new to their new is called Nunavut.
It's a Indian territory. They Controlling all the resources to resource.
One of how a national one national as a national one national to be recognizing with his population.
And, to end up to the end of us at least at the ones of us was in these remote areas, to realize that that are not the demote that are not account.
And for someone is home.
They have a search section of human imagination that are rising at the trees of the temples. And for us all of these children, as the swisdom of the swisdom of the swisdom of hope.
And to end up to the National Geographic we are convince to be able to swimming to swimming to swimming to swimming to swimming that politicians will never come to swimming.
We believe that the polemices --
Applausive, it's not los; it's not los; but we believe that the stories can change the world, and maybe we have the best institution, to tell stories of the world. Every month our own search 35 million visites.
156 Paesespecially our television --
Our sesex are cars from millions of people.
Our work is travel to bring our own own public in the etnos-of wonderful places, and cultural res, which will be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to the central reveal of the central of the inner of the main in different plant and we have to find a style of the plualist and the maintain and the maining and the multicultural and the mainalists and the mainly of the world

Thank you.
I'll talk about some things that I hope I was going to call it other that I hope you have heard and proverse other than you have heard and provided some links in case not to do anything to do with it.
I want to start with what I call "the official."
The official dog?
The official dog's official societal societal societal societal societal societal societal society is to be a recity, "If we want to look at the benefit is to make the freedom of the freedog."
The reason is that a slate, in the fact that the liberty is in the same value, is preptious for human human human human beings.
And in the other is in the fact that if we are free, each of us can act to do everything that that massit to make everything that that mass our benefit in a name in our name in the name of our benefit in the name of our benefit in the fact that if we are free, no one of us to do that if we are free to do everything that that is that if we are free, no one of us to do what if we are all the way to do you can do that if we are all the way to do you
The way to massit is massive massizing is massizing the choice.
The more choice people are free, and more and more and greater is their liberty, more and it's their bad.
This is so deep is so deeply in the societal society that no one would have dream.
And it's also deeply in our lives.
I'll show you some examples of what the progress has been possible.
This is my supermarket. It's not particularly great.
I lose a simple note on the conditional conditions.
In my supermarket -- there are 175 conditions, without containing the 10 variety of the extracets, and the 12 acets, and the 12 acets, which you can buy a huge number of constant constant number of one of the 175 already 75 consequent is to your grade of your grade and the 12 of your gradement.
Here's what the supermarket.
And then you go to the electron of electronic to buy a stereas a stereas a CD, radio, plast, the legacy.
And in this single single uncle of electronic electronic components.
We can make six million of different combinations using the components that are in one negoti.
You have to put that there's a lot of choice.
Some camp: the world of communications.
And once when I was a child, you could get all the phone to the phone of the phones, to pat that they were forced by mamma Bell.
It was born the phone, you don't buy it.
One of the consequence of that, between the other, it was that the phone is that the phone is makes.
These are gone.
Now we have a nearly illimitated phone, especially between cellular cells.
Here's the phones of the future.
My favorite is what in the middle of MP3, cut the bird of the hidden of the bird of the bird to the cryme --
If you don't have seen in the site negoties, you're below you to get to the rest of the becomes out.
And what is happening is that people in the site and does this question and does this question and this question and does this question is "No."
It doesn't have a cell phone that doesn't do too much stuff.
So in other aspects of life that are much more important, and it is that the same explosion of choice.
Assistence is not going to happen in the United States that you go from the doctor and the doctor of what you have to do.
I went to the doctor, and the doctor, you say, "Okay, we could do -- you know, "B" -- you know, "Ba," "Baa's faces and these sleeping and these skills and these s?"
He said, "Dottor, what should I do that?"
And the doctor says, "A has these benefits, and these saves, and these saves, and these saves and these risk."
"What does you want to do that?"
And you rebate "Dottor if she was to do that?"
And the doctor: But I don't have here."
The result of the result of the malator of malato," expression that makes it look like a beautiful thing.
But in fact, it's not a site to the fish, and responsibility of the understanding of someone who knows something -- and almost somewhere the doctor, to someone that doesn't know -- and almost it's not in the condition, and so not in the condition, and so it doesn't in the patient.
There's a huge marketing marketing products of products -- I would say to people like me and you, and if you think of it doesn't make any sense, that we can't buy them.
But if we can't buy them because you don't have them public public public public public public public public public public them.
The answer is that they want to do it for the door to ask us to change the receive to change the receive the receive to change the receive to change the receive to change the receive to change the receive the way to change the receive the receive to change the receive the receive to the reject.
That is that that fundamental as is our identity -- as a question of choice, as you see in this journey of the way, we want to see the children. We don't want to be able to the right time. We don't want to invest to invent.
And we can reinvent, so many times us --
The one that means every morning to the risk of the save, you have to decide that kind of person wants to be to be to be able to be to be able to be able to be able to the kind of person who wants to be able to be able to you that every more.
And I was the family, and a time time time the prospective section is almost to anyway, and it was that there was a lot of the most prevent to get the most prevent to get the most prevent to the most prescription.
The only one that was with chemical checke, not even even what do later.
On the day, all of play.
And I mean, in very intelligence students and their 20s to less than a time work in a long time.
And not because it's not a brilliant because they're not diligents.
But why are I impend to ask you to say, "Do I would have to do this right now, or no?"
"Do I have to think before I would look at the board, I would think before the kids or to the carrier?"
I'm a logiving logive.
And they try to answer these questions, even though this implements not complete the companies that you don't have a bel bel and not to get a bel of my exame.
And they have to do it. They're important questions.
Now, the work, we are lucky, as Carl subolineavy, because technology allows us to work every single single day, from every day, from every single angle of the planet, from the Hotel Randph.
Take it in the parentes; it's not to tell any any any any any quale, where the WiFi works.
I don't say it because I want to use it.
What does it means, this incredible freedom of the work that we have to continue to decide to work or not.
We can go to see our son toy with the cell phone in a pocket in a pocket in the other, and the night-topic needed on the knee.
And even if I have all the site that we see our kids to stand the game we also ask this to the game this called the hat?"
I said, "Do you have to answer this be? I have to take this letter?"
And even when the answer is "no," all this makes the experience of the game of your son son son to be in other conditions.
So, from any part of it, things and the big math and stils and stiles of life, life is a question of choices.
And once the world was this: Obbbe, there were some possibilities, but it was not a question of choice.
The world of today look like this: The dilemma is a positive thing -- "Is it a positive thing or negative, or negative, or negative, or negative,
The answer is South is a lot of it.
The positive of the good known of the negative of the negative of the negative of the negative of the negative of the negative of the negative of the negatives of the negatives of the negative of the negatives of the negatisss.
And that was two negative effects on two negative effective.
The first paradoxying, is that producing paraly;
With a lot of opptions that are she'd be very difficult to do it.
And I offer a meaning example of a meaning on the planets, the flying of pensionate pensionate pensionate pensionate of the flying.
A link of my colleagues of Vancer, the giant company of pension, with about a million client of pension, with about a million client companing in 2,000 companies.
What she found is that for every 10 solutions that are offered in the more, the percentage of adedesion of adedesion of of adedesion of of adedesion.
With 50 percent of offeres, there's 10percent of the less than adedesions when they're available to be available to 5. Why is that?
Because with 50 founds the founder of the cheap is very difficult to decide and the choice is to the indicate to the question.
And I still ask question, and of course, questions, and of course, the question, and of course, the question, and of course, the question, and of course, the question, and of course, the question, and of course, questions and all the question, and of course, the question, and of course, the question, and of course, the question, and of course, the question, and of course, the question, and of course,
And that doesn't mean that these work from old old old old manufactors will be enough to say that the decision is so much that the decision is so obstststage of the dator of the dator works.
Not speaking to 5000-dollars for the dator of the dator of the dator of the works, that would be well displace.
So the paralize is a consequence of having too much choices.
And I believe that makes the world like this.
And "And to end up the ethese, for the ethches, "Sketch;
You would just take the right decision if it's the right decision of the heterness, right?
You don't want to take the wrong to the wrong wrong and the wrong condition to the wrong condition to the wrong the wrong condition to the wrong the wrong condition to the wrong the wrong condition.
So this is the first effect is that if we can avive the paraly; and we can make a choice, we can do it with less of how to be able to be with less than the results.
And this for different reasons.
One of these is that with many conditions that the boys of which is that the alternative to do a different choice that you could have a different choice that would be better than it would be better than it would be better than the alternative to us to be better than the alternative to the construct of choice, and the reduce the requid the saving of the construction of the decision of the construction of the confidation that would be better than than it from the conflick.
even when it was a great decision.
The more choices -- it's easy to be easy to any detail of any detail of the option of the option of the option of the choice.
And yet, there's what economists call it cost-opportunity called an expensive opportunity.
Dan Gilbert has very well stamaten very well stamator that we go to the things that we get to the things that we confrontied.
After that is a lot of options that possible, is easy to represent, the paththicks of the option of the option that is choice.
Here's an example. I scuse with all those who are not in New York.
But it's probably worse to that.
There's this copy to Hamptons.
A place of the slow.
Spid: Otttless. It's all for them.
Not anything. But what he thinks it is: "Well, maledition, is Ago."
"All my neighbors in Manhattan are living.
"You could go home to the front of home."
And then two weeks that is losing from the idea that it's losing -- every day -- the possibility where you want to talk to where you want.
The cost expensive opportunity to the soddisfation for what we have, when the choice was very exciting --
And more are the options that we have to look at more the most of the characteristics will be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to look like the cost of the most of the options that we have to look at how to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
Here's another example.
This journey says a lot of things.
And there's about the living and maybe live in the time.
But the most important point is that anything you can choose to not do the other.
And the things that don't choose have a lot of attractive that can make less attactive what we do.
The third point, the growing of the expectance.
I tried to the bought a new jeans.
And I'm just just always jeans.
And once the jeans were a few of a type and vestyes, they were sweet and they were sweet and work a lot of times, they were starting to go wrong and work a lot of times, starting to go well.
So, I went to buy a couple of new when the old old of the old were gy; and said, "You need a couple of jeans, this is my cutk."
The committed to me, "Li wants slide slide -- fit, fit, and fit it up, and fit?"
Do you want to do with the bott? "Stonehed," or "aciddle or "acidse?
"Who wants to do that?"
"Well it wants or stret? Blland, you know, the blake --
I was sleep and after a little bit of a little bit of -- that was the only guy -- that was the only guy who was the only one of the time I tried to all 'stmales me to all 'stmales the jeans, and then the negoti, with the best jeaneans that ever ever had to get avail.
It was the whole bought the whole bunch of the bule.
But I felt worse.
Why? I wrote a book to understand it.
The reason I was worse to is that with all that choice was that the choice were expected to be perfected.
And I was expectance. I didn't expect to be perfecttly, when it was only one of the guy had to be perfect. But when I lived to be perfect.
What I had watched was good -- but not perfect.
After I paragoned to what I was trying to do with what I was trying to confront to expect to expect to expect to expect expectances.
The addition of options in life doesn't make the expectations that these have respect to the outsit of the options of the options itself.
And this will be very soddisfation, even when the results are good for the results are good for
No one in the world of marketing to make it content.
Because if you know that I don't know what I'm talking about.
The truth remainly like this.
"It was better when it was worse when it was worse to the most of when it was worse to it was worse was still possible to meet the premise of the premise of the prese of the prese of the prese of evolved.
On the world in the world where we live -- opulationalized industry, the site of the performation of the performation -- the massit that things are at the theates.
You never have to be surprise because your waiting for your expectations and expectations are ingiant ingiant and and be ingiant to be ingiant to be ungantites.
The secret of happiness -- what you're here -- "Bake was waiting "Yeah, you want to be wait."
I mean a little time -- that I'm really smarried and my wife is really stupend.
I couldn't do better, I don't have to do a meet --
But account it doesn't always make a good thing.
And finally, a consequence of the buying a couple of jeans smoke is that when there is only that kind of jeans is that when you're not unsoddisappears "Why do you do that?"
Who is responsi?" And the answer is clear.
The world is the responsible. What could I do?
When there are hundreds of jeans, and you buy a injeans, and you ask you to you who is responsible to you and you ask you to you, it's the responsible to you are you, you are you, you very clearly clear that you are you to you.
You could do better.
With hundreds of variety variety of the success -- not for the success.
So when people get the result is also if the result is valive, you feel income, they feel income, and they will give them them them to their own itself.
In the last few years of the depression is exploded in the industrialized.
I believe that a meaning -- not the universe -- not the issue, but important -- of this ondidie that people have experiences of deludent because the standards are too alone.
And when they have to explain this situation think that the colping is them.
So the final result is that in general is that in the same general thing we are better.
Let me just give you to me to give you a few few months.
This is the official dog; what all of you take for good and it's completely fail.
There's no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than that doesn't have to do it that not to do that much choice is better than a little choice is better than a pose of a pose choice is better than a pose of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little choice is better than a little choice
There's a critical value, magic value.
But I'm sure we have been boring enough to a piece of the level where the choices are improvise our life.
Now, from the political point of the political point -- I have almost finally -- from the make, the noce, the noce, the noce.
What it allows all this choice in society is the reef.
There are many places in the world, and you know about -- you know what the problem is not that have too much choice.
The problem is that they have too much a few years old.
So the way the door I'm talking about is a mal, to be excluside, which society that society has to society that society societes.
And what makes you depress and array, it's a lot of money, that is that Steve Levitt talked about how that constoks and sweet them are ineat. It's a money to money.
I mean that these complicated choice, and dispended dependious, it's not just ineat, it's not just ineat.
I'm deththleteries.
They make worse worse.
If a little bit of what in our societies allows to be reversated in those where people have too much chance, it would be not only their life to improving but the nogift but also the nogift but the nogist of what in our society.
This is what economists call a improvement improvement improvement.
A redistribution of reduction is good to all -- not only to the poor -- because of this choice in except that it in a quease that would be in the except that you get to the poor -- because of this choice in the poor -- because of this choice in the
And to conclude is, "Fick, you can become everything that you want, "...
Vooes, people think about culture, depensers -- what credi?"
"It's obvious that you can't make anything in a bock of a vetrow."
"A cocaster view of the world's world."
and I interpret that I interpretated it as it begin.
But then, I realize that that that fish, I realized that that fish, I realize that that fish.
Because the reality of fact is that if you managed to the mous, in the way that "everything is possible." You get the paraly." You get the paraly;
If you rose the bock in a way that all becomes the way to be possible to diminual soddisfation.
Accepting the paralysis, and you reduce the benefit to be able to get the benefit to the word.
Everybody need a sfer.
This is almost certainly too much too much too much too much for the fish, and safe for us to us.
But the assumes of some symboll is a recipe for infelicity for infelicity -- for the rovine.
Thank you very much.
