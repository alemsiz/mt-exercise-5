And last year, I showed these slides to show that the glacial calculation that for almost three million years had been the size of 48 million years had the size of 48 percent of the United States of 40 percent.
However, this is the gravity of the problem because it doesn't show the of, the beautiful because it doesn't show the of,
The art glacial art is, in a certain sense, the clean heart heart of global climate system.
You go and get the summer and windles.
The next next slides will be a rapid carlled on the last 25 years.
The gaus lost are signed in red it.
As you can see it all to the blue slights.
That's the ice, that is the ice in winter winter of the summer.
You can see that the glacious glacious glacious gather, is like the blood that coming out of the body of the body --
In 25 years was passed from that way.
This is a problem because the interests interested in the ice, the art of the art that the art where there are enormous amount of carbon that and the microbs that are transformed in metaphands.
Rispspheric polluting of the atmospheric pollutional warming, that amount could double, super-beautiful point.
In some few laka little deep in Alaska deep in Alaska is already bolling from water.
The professors Katey Walter University of Alaska has recated team was recently a team at a team at the bottom last time.
Video: Wow! Al Gore: Wow! She's good.
And this is that this exchange that this exchange the Groenland is that the Greenland from the north.
This is a river.
The leveled was never reached the similar levels.
This is the Kangerlussuaded in the south of Greenland and of the Greenland
If you want to know how the skin the level of the level of the landing of lands, here is where the sea.
These corres are increasing rapidly.
On the other part of the planet: Antarct's largest ice of the planet.
The last month last month, the scientists have declared that the balance of the ice is in negative, and that Antarctive on some islands under the islands underwater in the sheet.
Eval in the water of water level, like in Greenland in Greenland and in Groenland and in Groenland and in Groenland in Groenland.
On Himalayan Himalayan third block of ice ice block and the laghi, who were very few years ago were ice.
40 percent of the world's population was going to get halfway from the slightly pokey from the sea population that we have a degree population from the population population that is a half the middle of the world's population that is recently reach.
Sulle Ande: this glacier is the source of the city.
The door, it has increased.
But when he deminuses the same happens to the water pocket.
In California in the Sierra Nevada is decreased 40 percent.
The hydrive background crisis.
The previsions, as you have a bed one.
The growing growing world to a remarkable increasing for incendeded,
And the environmental disasters are increasing to a rhythmen and without precedent.
Four times more numbers in the last 30 years about the last 30 years of previous respect to the last 30 years.
This is a sustainable god-sustainable going.
If you look at the context if you can see the consequences.
In the last five years we added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the ocean.
Look at the Eastern Pacific Pacific in the west, and the west, and on both the continent of Indian continent, where there's a poveriment of oxygygen in the ocean.
More than global warming, together and the deforestation, and that is the 20 percent, is the use of fossil fuel of fossil fuels.
The oil is a problem, and the carbon is a problem, and the carbon is even worse.
The United States are one of the most emissions together,
And they propose to build many other carbon and fashion.
But we're seeing to a change of direction.
These are the annual projects in the last few years and some alternative proposes.
Everyway, there's a political lotly in our country.
Carbon and oil industries have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote the carbon that clean that is a oxide oxymore.
And this picture reminded me something,
Versee, in Tennessee, where I live, there was a 3.8 billion g-horiginal carbon dioximming carbon dig.
You may seen it on the news of news that
This is the second largest flows to America.
It happened around Natmaking.
The publishing of one of the carbon industries was this one.
Video: She would be the carbononon is a type and happy.
It's a fabundant here in America, and it grow our economy.
Frosty carbononaio is increasingly clean up.
It's pretty good for price, adorable and workers keep the stypending.
Al Gore: Fince here is a lot of carbon West Virginia.
The largest society on the mountains is Massey Coal. This is his administrator.
Video: Don Blankhenship: I'm going to clear -- Al Gore, Nancy Pelow, Harry Reid -- they don't know what they're talking about.
Al Gore: So the Proteam for the Protep of Clima Clima has two campaigns.
This is a button -- one of it.
Video: Actually, we see the climate changes as a climate changes as a threat to our business to our business to our business.
So our priority is to invest a big amount of money in a public effort to make public and confused to make public truth.
In fact, the carbon is not sporks.
We think it is a good fumatter -- it also has a good progress.
So not predictor of climate change.
Let me do that.
Video: Aclean -- you know, you know, you heard a lot of them -- you heard a lot of it.
So let's take a gyp in a structure to the framework for clean meat.
Straordinary machines are a little noise what, but this is the sound of carbon technology.
The consuming carbon is between the main causes of global warming causes of carbon disease. But the carbon that you see changes everything.
You look at a eye -- this is the technology of carbon digital carbon.
Al Gore: Infinally, the alternative positive is connecting to economic and economic security.
Video: Comment: The America, is in the crisi; the economy, national security climate crisis.
The move that college all of the way our combusts and the fossil fuel and the important, like carbon and the important.
Now, there's a new audition for using solution for use.
Repower America: 1000 percent of clean energy in 10 years.
They plan to put America on work, to make America work, and help us to stop the global warming.
Finally, one solution, a solution that you have our problems.
Repower America. Scover point.
Al Gore: This is the ultimate one.
Video: Comment: His about refying energy to America.
One of the fastest ways to bring the dependence from combustible combustid our planet.
I really, the future is here. I just go on the energy network.
She shot 2: Noves investment for places of beautiful working,
M: Repower America. It's time to be realists.
Al Gore: a old African proverbio african says, "If you want to go to you, go to it.
If you want to go away away together."
We have to go away away at the fast.
Thank you very much.
The last year at TED fect last year, I was a introduction on LHC.
And I promise to go back to the back of how the car.
So here I got it. And for those who the other time is the other time there is no scientific experiments ever tried -- 27 miles of circumstomes.
His compiece of returning the conditions that were present less than a billion of a second.
That's just environment.
This is the machine underneath Gineva.
We photographing these mini-Big Bang Big in the relaws.
This is what I work. It's called ATLAS -- is large-four feet and has a 22 feet and has a 22 feet of half feet --
This is a spectacular image of ATLAS in building so you can see the proportion of the proportion of ATLA:
The 10 settember of the last year we access, we access,
And this picture was taken by ATLAS.
It was a lot of unseen fest-fest-fest-fest-on room room in the control.
It's a picture of the first particles that had done all the bound of the LHC, and in collision, deliberately, with a part of the LHC, and spread particles.
In other words, when we set that image the 10 sless, we figured out that the machine works, which is a big life.
I don't know if it was to do it more or this when somebody went to Google and he saw that the page beginning was this one.
That means that we had a cultural impact over to that scientific exactly that scientific impact.
About a week later, there was a problem with the machine, it had to these files -- these sleeps -- these sweek files.
These files are let 13,000 feet when the machine works in the power.
Now, technicians between you look at the files and say, "It's not true. I'm not true.
And they can do it because when they're very cold when they are the cosidy of the superconvictors.
So, at less 271 degrees, to a nurture of the space between the stars, these movies can bring that body is the body of the space between the stars, these files can bring that body with the board.
In one of the most of the magnets in the LHC, there was a defectly reaching defection of the factoration.
So the files are surrises that they read up and 13,000 of suddenly meeting a electrical resistance.
This was the result.
Now, this is even more impression, if you think these magnets are more than 20 tons than 20 tons and they moved about 30 centimeters.
They are damaged about 50 magnets.
We had to take them took it, what we did it.
We repristine and recently and add it.
They're now now now they're returning to the ground.
English the end of the LHC will be again in new integro.
We let them and let me look at the data or set, and then our wind and the wind and so our adventure to discover what the universe.
Now, of course, in a certain quote, these accidents reaching the debate on the value of science and engineering in frontiers. It's easy to confit in the future of confurning.
I think that the fact that it is so difficult to go beyond the limits, I think this is the value of things like LHC.
I would like to end with words of a scientist Inglese, Humphrey Davy, who image, in defense defense of inutenginal inutter, his pupll, his pupll, his point was so dangerous for progress of the human mind as write that the degress of the human mind as the reality of the mind of the world's mind as well-being."
Thank you.
I want to start asking you to think about this and as children, played with children, playing playing the bricks.
And as you realize them and reaching them and reach them and reach them and move them, and learning in fact, and learning about and resolving problems and manipulating relations.
The space reason is deeply connected, the way we understand most of the world around us.
So by information informed by using the chance of our interaction with physical objects, and my consults, and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi, I started asking myself to ask myself as a computer, instead of the mouse as a computer, we use a computer, instead of the mouse as a physically digital information with both information with both hands
and we want to put it to our please?
The question was so interesting that we decided we decided to explore the answer Siftable.
In a few words, a Siftable computer is a big interactive as a biocot.
In a few words, a Siftable computer is a big interactive as a biocot.
You can move them with hand, they can see the hand, they can see their motion and they have a screen and a wireless.
But about, I'm physical objects, as physical objects, you can just be able to be simply to be retained.
The Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem of tools to manipulate the digital information.
And as we become more physics, and they are more physics, and others, and as they become more physics, and as they become more physics, and they can explore new and other things that we can explore and new fun and fun and fun fun and fun and different stiles.
I'm going to start with some simple example.
This is Siftable to show the video -- if you including the video -- if you including it in a direction, if you including it will go back to the other side of the other part.
These interactive riticians are aware of others.
If they are in the business are interested in what they are going to be around the time.
If they come circumstom, and they can get a little bit.
If they come circumstom, and they can get a little bit.
They also have their movement and incline.
We then realized that one of the interesting of the interaction was powered to use the power of the data, as if it was a liquid.
In this case, we have three Siftable configurated as secks of green vernice and I can use them to use them to be mix in the central central color.
and I can use them to use them to the color in the central central color, where they mix mixe.
If we do a little bit of it, we can put a little bit about place.
These are beautiful chance of learning, like mathematics and games of logical games where people can try and extra things that we can try and see the immediately.
Now I'm --
This is a Fibonacus that I do with a program of equations.
Here we have a words of words that is half between Scarabeo and Boggle.
Basically, to every turn and you get a letter to every settle on every Siftable, and I got a letter to all turn a letter to all the Siftable, and while you try to get words of a dictionary.
Then, after about 30 seconds remissing and new set of reading and new chance of reading and new possibilities to try to try to try to try to do.
Thank you.
Here's the children came to the Media Lab, I did that I tried them and I did a video.
They are pleased to them.
And one of the interesting things about this is that you don't have to have a lot of education is that you don't have to have a lot of education.
You just have to say, "Poons and words, and they know exactly what to do.
Here's some other people who try to do it.
This is our most younger head beautiful beta right there.
It actually wanted to be the large challenge them.
They just were the seem for him.
Now, this is a interactive application of a interactive card.
We wanted to build a tool appreciation of the Lui is Felix.
It can inserve new characters in the scene, and spread Siftable and associated with their associated associated with their associated with their associated with the slides.
It can inserve new characters in the scene, and spread Siftable and associated with their associated associated with their associated with their associated with the slides.
And that's doing the sun.
Video: The suntil is sleeping on the sun.
David Merrill: It has taken a treat the scene.
Video: The arancient treat.
Bel work!
So school Siftable and put them neighbors can make the characters --
Video: Bau!
and inventing their story.
Video: Hellao!
DM: It's a story with open as a final story as you would.
DM: It's a story with open as a final story as you would.
Video: Vole, you know, I gact.
DM: The last example I have time to show you is a tool, recently recently to sample, and to sample,
it's a instrument, recently to sample and sample, and to sample and music.
The Siftable here are flowing on how batteria.
Each of these has four different variations, and you can choose what use.
You can also inserve these sound sound in a sequence to your sequence to your experience.
And it just to make it just make a sound to be a sound of a sequence."
These are effects that you can control from living, like reverse and the filter.
And then you attack to a particular sound and then including it.
And then there are general effects like time and volume, and volume, which are apply to the sequence.
Let's look at how it works.
Video: DM: We're going to start a base in two Sequence, we will put in a sequence, we will put it in a series, we get to extend to be able to do the base.
Now I put a lower on the bottom of the bottom.
Video: DM: Oh, add of the perceptual --
Video: DM: And I'm going to put the movie to the bacteria, so I can control effect.
Video: I know how to quickly the entire sequence inclining time from one side or on the other side of the side of the side of the sequence inclining time from one side.
Video: Something to give more expression.
Video: I can get the sequence of the sequence of the sequence of the sequence of volo."
So I didn't have to planning it before, but I can try and provising, make it longer or more shorty.
And now, finally, I can smoke the entire sequence inclining the entire sequence the Siftable "volume.
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is building new interface that new interface that our brain and more look like our brain and body elective.
And today, I had time to show you one of the results of this peror, and also some possibilities that we try to bring out of the lab.
The concept I want to transmit you is that is coming this new generation of design objects to interact with digital media that will be information in our world in the way we want to do.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the time to talk to all of you.
They're a write write --
She write books is my professional professional --
It's also love and the fashcine of my life.
And I don't think it can change it.
But I said, something particular happened in my life, and my career in my life, and my career and my career to realibrating the entire recently report with this work.
And the particular thing is that I recently written this book, this is called "Mangia, Prega, Ama" what my previous -- my previous libris, for some reason for some reason for some of the world and became a big -- and he became a big -- interact of interaction.
And the result is that everywhere from now, people are treating me as if I were convicted to me.
By -- convict: Shanannate!
They all come to me and worried and they say, "You don't fear more to be afraid to do better?
You don't fear you keep writing to write for all life without power to create a book that can be able to make someon?"
that can be able to someon?"
It's a remainsure you know.
But it could go worse, I think I was a lot more than 20 years ago, when I started to say to people -- I was an adolescent -- I was an adolescent -- I wanted to be a write write to me.
I met against the same based by the fefear.
And people said, "Don't you know, I don't want to have success?
Don't you fear that the humor you fear that the hump?
You are not afraid to do this mester for all life without anything that was going to die and must never die on a heart of a dresss infraning with the mouth of fallight?"
So you know, you know.
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is, "Y."
I fear I fear of all of these things.
I always had fear that I had been fear.
And I also fear of many other things that people might not have to inate.
As a and other things frightening things like that.
But, as I think about the write what I thought and asked me ultimously is why why is?
Is it ration?
It's logic, who who have to be expect to be being frightened to do
But what is so that particular in the impresequative to make us remaining health mental health of the mindset, other carrier not doing it?
How my father for example, he was a chemistry and I don't rememistry a time in his 40 years of activities in which he was asked if he was to be able to engineer if he was going to be able to engineer it to be able to engineer it was a chemistry and I don't think of it was going to be able to be able to engineer a chemistry that was a chemistry engine
There was never -- that that the engineer of John, like what?
It didn't work, it work?
Onestly, the Enest, chemical engineers don't have certainly, in the secooked the reputation of being alcohyacefully maniacres.
And we writer, we have this reputation, and not only of the repursue of all kinds of generally instable to be enormously instable to instable.
And it's not really, to look at the contains of the magnificent of magnific deaths and often young people and often young and often to hand.
And the ones that they don't seem to be really dissmoke to be really disled by their women.
Normanaged before I did, in the last interview said, "Oh, my book had killed a little more. And I was just a little bit more." One extraordinary record to the work of their life.
But we don't bat when we feel that because we have these things that we have these things that somehow we have interiored and accepted the notion that creativity and the art is that creativity and the art and the art and the art and the art and the art and the art and the art and the art and the art and the art and the art of the anguy's going to be be.
And the question I want to ask all of this is that I want to ask with this ideas?
It goes you do this -- because it also looks from a centimeter of me distance centimeter of me --
I think it's hat.
And I think it's even dangerous and I don't want to see perpetuatel.
I think it's better to be better to be better to live our big creative to live.
And I certainly know that in my case -- in my situation -- would be very dangerous to become up with that I had dark up to the rest of the circumstances in my careers.
One true -- this is a little bit of a lot of years.
I have about four decades of work in me.
And it's very likely to be likely to write in the world will be right now that he was going to be right after the work that was happening after the last book.
I'm going to be squirt, because we're all more or friends here -- it's likely my greatest success is to my be.
Oh, Gesus, that you think of it!
You know this is the kind of though, which leads a person to start to begin to nine morning, and I don't want to do it.
I would keep doing this work that we love.
So, the question becomes like, what?
And so I seeds after a lot of reflections that the way to work to continue to do a psychological psychological cost psychological structure, ok?
I have to find a distance of a distance between me, that I'm write in me, that I'm written to be able to get out of what the reaction is going to be able to get out of the year models on how to do I began to look through the time to look through the time if they could have some more societies and more health ideas and more health and more sane sane and sane sane --
how to help people creative people to help people in the inerently emotional inerently creative people in creativity.
And that research has taken me to the ancient Greea and ancient Rome.
You follow me because it turns out to try and then back.
In the ancient and ancient Rome -- people didn't seem to believe that the creativity came from humans, OK?
And he thought the creativity was this is about the divine and that came to humans and come to some hand-known surface and unknown as well.
The grees called these spirits of the creativity of creativity of the demons."
Socrate, wonderful of course, he thought to have a demon that elargiven sage.
The Romans were the same kind of spirit without body with the kind of spirit without a genius.
which is great, because the Romans didn't think that a genius would really think that a genius.
They believe that a genius is this kind of kind of inspired entity that was living in the walls of an artist, a little bit like the Dobby, and that came out of the artist, and that was the argument of the result of that work.
Excectial -- that's the distance of which is -- that is the distance of the psychological psychological that protects you from your work.
And everybody knew that was so that it worked, right?
So the anti-suming artists were protecting to certain things, like the too narcissm, right?
If your work was exceptional was not to take all the market, everybody knew that was helped by this incorporate that incorporate incorporate that incorporate incorporate that incorporate incorporate all of the market, you could not get to get all the market, and you could not get the market, and you could not get the market, and you could not get to get all the market,
If your work is failure, it was not all your own own your own own own short?
Everybody knew that was your genius.
And so people have conceived the creativity in Occident for a long time.
And then Rinaasciently, and it all changed this big idea; we put the humans on the center of the universe and the longer and and no longer and left and no longer and and left and more and no longer and and no longer and and no longer and the divinity.
This was the principle, rational principle, and people began to think that the creativity came completely from the ispsplie.
And for the first time in history, he started to refering this or artist as a geniusing a genius with genius.
And I have to tell you, I think it was a big error.
I think that allowing someone that simple people to believe being as a reciply as a recipe of being as the founds, creative and the source of all my beings, creative, inknown and eerments is a responsibility to the fragile of human beings to the fragile of human beings.
It's like to ask somebody to engineer the sun.
And it completely and the totally and creates all these ingestible ingestive and creates all these ingestished.
And I think this was this pressure that I destroyed artists in the past.
And if this is true, and I think that the question becomes and now?
Can we do it different?
Maybe I think more and more to a more expensive understanding between humans and creative mystery.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we can't cut 500 years of rational thinking in a 18 minutes.
And there are probably people in the audience that would be legitties that would be light to the notion of scientific notion that following people to do that they follow their projects.
And I probably won't you all about this thing.
But the question I would like to ask is -- why you know?
Why don't you think it in this way?
Because it has more sense of any other thing that has ever heard to explain the exhalf of creative process.
One process that, as anyone who ever ever ever tried to do something -- so basically -- you don't get rationally, you don't behave.
And in fact, it can sometimes completely paranormal seem completely paranormal seem completely paranorm.
I did this meeting with the extraordinary Ruth Stone, who has 90 years, but it was a poet, but it was a poet, and he said that during his own childhood in the wall, and he said that in the wall, and I was working out of the wind when a poem was coming from the country.
He said it was like a hard level.
And that was going to get towards from the landscape.
It was going to come there, because he had to try to get the earth under its feet.
He knew to have one thing to do to that point and it was to do that point and he said, "See a morn."
And so it comes home and it was following from this poetry and it would not have to do that take a piece of paper and and a pretty fastic paper and and a pretty fastic in the page.
Sometimes he couldn't be quicked, so corrected, so correcties and and running and the rotate and the rotate and the rolled rotate through and and it would continue to rotate through the landscape, and he would continue through the landscape, "another poet."
And then there were those times -- this piece of piece of the time I never forget -- there were about the time when the almost lost, OK?
So he was running at home and was looking for the card and the poetry went through the waste and and he was going to go through the well and then he said, he was going to snap with the other hand and and the off.
And he was the poem from the coda and reputs it in his body and transcritish the page.
And in these cases, the poetry would be presented on perfect and intact page and the last word at the last word for the first one.
So when I felt -- it's crazy, it's the same equal process.
I don't have my creative process -- I'm not a convict!
I'm a mule, and my way to work and my work to wake up and the same way to go and work and work and work and work and go up and go up and go up and go over and get us enjoy.
But even in my head, in my head and I slide against that thing,
And I guess that even many of you have done to do
You know, even if the work and ideas and ideas and ideas they could be that you can't be honestly knowledge it.
And what is this thing?
And how can we reach it to it in it it to not to make us head and buttom, but it makes us health?
And as I think about it, the best example I have the best example I have is Tom Waits, which I interviewed different years ago for a day.
We were talking about this, and you know, Tom, and you know, Tom, for the major of life has been the incarnation of contemporary to control and trying to control and control, dominating these kind of emport creative impulses.
But then he was hot and hot one day, and one day, while he was driving on the highway to Los Angeles, he changed all for him.
He was going to fast and all of a tract that little fragment of melodia, which is to be a half as the inspiration, elusive and and all-up, and the wish and wish and wish and wish it doesn't know how to take it.
It has no piece of paper, it doesn't have a mathem, it has no recorator.
So it starts to feel this kind of old old old old old old growing in him, and I will come up with the hopen by this song as well as this song as well.
I'm not good enough and I can't do this this way.
And instead of going to stop in the panic same.
And he went to the whole process and they did something completely new thing.
And he just just looked at the sky and said, "Sore, you can't see that I'm driving it?"
"You seems that can write a song now?
If you really want to exist, it will come back to a more opportunity when I can take care of you.
Other people are going to get somebody else today.
You go to the Leonard Cohen."
And his working process was working after this.
Not work, the work was still dark as much as you pretty much as you pret.
But the process, and the fish that was going to attemerged when the genius, the genius, the genius that was that the other problems and remaking it that it was not to be a whole thing and realizing it was not to be a interior.
but well, this piece of piece of bizarre collaboration a conversation between Tom and this strange and this strange external and external thing that was not Tom.
So I felt that story began to change a little bit of the way I worked and already saved me a little bit of a time.
This idea, saved when I was writing "Mangia, Prega, and I was going to fall, and I was going to be a falling on something and we can't and and we can't and and and start thinking that will be a disaster, that that that that will be the worst of the worst book never write.
Not only n't, the worst book written --
And I started to think about designing this project.
But then I remembered Tom that talked to the air and try to us.
So I got my face on my face on the manner and I would say my comments to a corner angle.
And I said to high you, "Yes, what both is both that if this book not going to be brilliant not going to be brilliant not going to be brilliold, right?
Because as I see I'm going to put all of this.
So if you want it to be better and you have to be better and make your parts.
Okay, you know, you don't know what you know, I don't know what I don't have to be anything.
I'm going to write the same because it's my work.
And I would like to have that it was recorded to me that I today presented to me to make my part, because -- the end is like this, and then it is it in the deserts of North Africa in the deserts of the moons and the sacred of the long and the hours and the sacred of the long and the hours to the albe.
And they were always magnificent, because the ballers were professional and they were fantastic.
But every one of these artists would be something that was actually translated translate to be transendent in fact,
And I know what you know about what I know about why I know that you all have been talking about a certain point, a performance like that.
It was as if you stop and the walking and dancing walking through a kind of landing and not doing anything in different from the solite, but it was not doing anything in the sun, but everything is moving to it.
And suddenly it doesn't just like a human.
But you access to the behind and under device,
And when this was happening to the them, and people knew what was was, they were called her name.
They were the hands and they started sing and and they were starting to sing and and and God God,
That's God, you know.
Curious note -- when the Morder the south of Spain, and they would have this habits with their and pronune changed in the century of "Allah, oh, whole, which is still you can still hear in the cordings, or "Oh, that you can still hear in the cordings or the flew in the sun.
In Spain, when an artist did something impossible and magic and magic and magic -- oh, but, you know, I mean an an an argument -- a folks, a fall, a fall.
And it's big because we needed it.
But, the problem goes the day, the time to dance, when you wake up and and discovers that are the 11 morning, and the God is 11 a.m.
It's just a mortal death with a lot of the knees that will never be able to get that to be able to get that head to the head of the way.
And maybe no one canor cancer the name of God while and what you have to do with the rest of his live?
It's hard to it.
This is one of the most painful reconciliations to make a creative life.
But maybe it doesn't have to be so anguying if you can not believe it in the best waste that the most extraordinary expects of your being from you as well.
But believe it just to you that are given to you from a inpictures of this squisite part of your life that you have to go to somebody else when you find.
And you know, if we think in this way.
And so I started thinking about it, and it's sure as I thought about it for several months during the book that I will public book that I will have prest, the dangerous cheap, the dangerous success.
And what I have to continue to tell me when I feel electric feeling that is not afraid
I don't just furp you.
It can be able to presenting you for your parts, whatever can be.
If your work is dancing, dancing, dance, it does.
If the divine, you know, you would mean to let some kind of a beautiful kind of wonderful for one moment through your effort your effort, then "Ole!"
Other you do the same your dance.
And "Ole!" to yourself.
I think I think it would be to teach it.
"Ole!" at you, even in the same, even for human love and head and textboards that you can actually make you continuously.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
As I know I already talked about some of these projects on human, what can meaning and discovering new set of genes.
Now we're starting a new path and we began to digitizing biology and now to start from that code de that we are entering a new biology, designing and synthesizing and synthesizing and synthesizing and synthesizing and synthesizing and and synthesize biology and now to start to deal with bi
We always tried to ask questions.
"What is life?" is something that many biological biological to understand various levels.
We tried different approaches, reducing it to the minimes of the terms.
We're digitizing by almost 20 years now.
When we sequenced the human genome is to go from the world world biology to the digital world of the computer.
Now we ask us, we can regenerate life, or create new life from this digital universe that digital universe
This is the map of a small organism, the Mycoplasma genome that is the smallest species from the smallest genome in the lab.
And we tried to reduce the genome to create a little bit more smaller than a little bit of a smaller.
We're able to eliminate a hundred genes of the around 500 people who are here.
But when we look at his metabolic map of the metabolic map of us.
See, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can heliminat, one at the time, is very unlikely to bring a live.
So we decided that the only way to progress to be synthesize this chromosome, so that we could modifit to bring some of these fundamental questions.
And so we started wind the wind of "Cromom cromom chromoom?"
Can chemistry confidence that we never could make these big molecules that we never could create before?
And in case reality, can we make a chromos?
A chemist is just a piece of chemical material of chemistry material that is just a piece of chemistry chemistry piece of chemistry material of chemistry chemistry of chemistry.
The speed with which we are able to digitizing life is growing up to exponential rhythm.
Our ability to write the genetic code, rather progregress depends on a slowly, but it's better way.
And our more recently results the door to a exponential curve.
We started over 15 years ago.
The process has required, beginning with a bio-review review before we began to be the first experiments.
But we found that synthesize DNA is is very difficult.
There are tens of thousands of machines in the world that produce small segments of DNA, of the longer than 30 to 50 labor is a degenerative process.
So we had to develop a new method to assembling these fragments and correct the mistakes these and correct them up.
And this was our first attempt to start by digital information of Phi X 174.
It's a little virus that kills batteries.
We designed the errors of the errors and made a molecule of DNA molecule of DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters.
And the interesting part is when we took this piece of chemical material and insert that we put it in bacteria, they began to read this genetic code and produce that virals.
The virals are then released by cells, they are back from cells, and they have found the Elles.
I talked about recently with members of oil industry says that they certainly have been talking about this model.
They have more than you.
We think this is a situation where software can actually build its own hardware can actually build the same hardware in a biological system.
But we wanted to do things more in big.
We wanted to build the whole chromosome.
They're more than 580 thousand led code genetic code.
So we thought to build it in the size of viruses of viruses so that we could change the cassets to figure out what the components are a living cell.
Dewing is crucial information in a computer, these are digital information in a computer, these are to be very accurate to be very accurated.
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 accuratezed was a standard of a mibasic error for every 10 thousand basis.
We found out of that, 30 errors. If we had that original sequencing sequence we would never be able to do it.
One part of the process is to design seats 50 letters that are overwhelming with all of the other seats 50 letters of the labels to build smaller sub-labeled land.
We try elements onto here.
You probably read that we read the big.
Think of this one thing about four letter: We have a genetic code on four letter: A, C, C, GGs and T.
Three of those letters code together and code about 20 loves, and there's a specific orders of reading for every love.
So we can use genetic code to write words, and thinking.
What we did in the beginning is automous to the beginning.
Some have been delused by the fact that it was not poeking.
We designed these segments to just just unique them with the entire with the entire holds.
There are people to repaid them and they repaid them and they put them together.
And we started assembling the particular seating, starting with five seven miles of seven a lot of miles away from 24 miles of labeled to them to get 72 miletter to get 72 milliters.
We produced these segments in abundance so that we can sequenced to be able to sequencing that we're trying to create a extraordinary proceiving that we are in a minute.
We're trying to automatize the process.
So, this seems the tabellon a basket.
When we get to these very long-hundred segments more than 100 miles and more directly in E. cole more directly in E.
You get to the middle tools of the molecular biology of molecular biology.
So we considered other mechanisms.
We knew another mechanism called omology recombination of a biology that in biology to repaid the DNA to repair seats.
Here's an example.
This organism, called Deinococcus radiation can absorb three million radication.
You can see in the high team as his chromosome.
In 12 -- 24 hours comes to reassembled exactly as it was before.
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do it.
These organisms can set out completely.
They can live under empty.
They're absolutely certain life exists in space, and you move to find new environments of water water and several reals.
In fact, NASA showed that this living living.
This is a molecule that we built that we built using these process, just using these process, just using the lievidence of segments.
The lievidence that allows up automatically.
This image was not taken with a electronic microscope with a rule.
It's a molecule that we can see it with a microscope with a microscope law.
These are pictures that cover a period of about six seconds.
This is the publishing that we did a little time ago.
They're more than 580,000 letting genetic code
It's the greatest molecule ever made by man.
It has 300 million molecular high school at 300 million of them.
If we were going to take 10 without space, you would take 10 without space, it would just take to get this genetic code this code of genetic code.
Now, how do we do that? How can we do that?
Obviously, you can go to virus is a girl.
It's a little bit more complicated when they use the batteries.
It's simpler even when it's the eucarios as our res: you can just extractly extremely the nucleus and insert another one of the clon.
In the archaea chromosome, is the chromosome, but we recently demonstrately that we are able to make a complete transplant that we can do a complete transplant from a cell of a cell and activate it.
We purifted a chromosomes from a species.
The two are different as men as wrong.
We have some gene gene in a little bit of a way that I could decide what you can chromosoon.
And then he slides with the enzymes in a way to kill all the proteins.
And when we put in the cell, the cell was wonderful -- and you learn our chromosome, the new chromosome, the new chromosome.
And we started thinking we couldn't go beyond that, but we tried to go beyond there.
This is one of the greatest mechanisms of evolution.
We found that a lot of species have added a second or a third chromosomes from some part of the begins that species.
So who think about evolution as only as a gene gene that modifashional is a lot of biology.
There are people called "restrial restrial of restrion is that they have DNA.
The chromosome, that it was in the cell that it was in the cell that it was in the cell that was in the cell that it was in the cell that it was in the cell.
Man: The cromosomes that we insert --
And you know, and he recognized the other chromosome, as the extremely as an extremely and we have been recognized with only the cell and new chromoso.
it became blue because of the genes that we have inserved it.
And in a short left of all the characterists of a species are gone in a new species, and it turned from the new species, and we put it into the new software that we inserted in the mobile phone.
All the proteins have changed, members have changed, and when we read the genetic code of the equivalent that we transferited you.
Now, this may seem alchemy genetics, but altering the software as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as well.
Now, I've already explained that you don't talk about genesis -- but by progression three million years of evolution, and I said that maybe we're doing a new version of the Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosion that you will create new species about this digital process.
Why do that?
I think it's enough when we think about our needs when we think about our needs.
We're going to spend six billion and a half billion in the next 40 years.
I'm born to give example, I was born in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for each existent in 1946; in 40 years, there are are going to be four years,
We're doing a problems now to find food, water and clean water and clean and gas, medicinal and half bas for six billion and a half billion people.
It's going to be harder for nine billion.
We can get more than five carbon digital carbon and over 30 billion bars.
That means a day.
When we try to find biological processes or whatever kind of process to replace them, it will be a huge challenge them, it will be a huge challenge of a challenge to be a huge challenge of a lot of process.
In more we have to keep the CO2 emission of CO2 emission of these materials that ended up in the atmosphere.
At day, thank you very much, thanks to the scientific discoveries around the world, we have a database with about 20 million genes and I like to think that are designed for the future.
The electronic industry has only only a dozen of components, and think about how many different things came out.
Our limits are major biological reality and our imagination.
Now we have techniques, thank you very much, thods these methods that we call combined.
We can build a big robots that can produce a million chromosomes a million chromosomes to the day.
Think of processing these 20 million different genes or to try to get the processing processing to make a very good bals, or drugs, new vaccines, we can change a little bit of a little team, and create more biology than in the last 20 years,
And it's just a standard selection.
We can chemical chemistry for chemistry chemical or carbon and carbon vaccines of vaccines of vaccines --
This is a few software programmed with some software programmed to be able to seat, and design species and design species.
Well, we don't know necessarily as they will be not.
We know exactly how their genetic code of genetic code.
Now we're focused on focused on four-generation.
You see that you can go to the ethanol from the sea was a bad experiment experiment experiment.
We have a second further and third generation that will come up pretty soon as carbon digar in carbon and various carbon or different kinds of burn or different kinds of places.
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without even more foodly the cost of food, and limited the constant, and we think we are working to design the CO2 in the material that we're working to design cells that we work to design this discover, and we think we could reach this discover, and we think we could reach this discoveries of those first months.
The sunlight with CO2 is a methodom -- but in our discoveries all over the world, we found different methods.
This is a organism that we described in 1996.
It lives in the deep ocean deep about 2500 feet of the water deep eplace to temperature of water water and the water of the water.
It takes them from CO2 using molecular power like the source of energy source like the energy source of energy.
We're trying to figure out whether we can be choice, that it can easily be transported to be transported through your carbon that CO2 carbon to drive this process.
So we think that we could be able to increase what we could be able to increase what the basic questions is Now, trueful -- we have the goal -- we have the obillion to replace the oil industry.
Exactly. If you can't do it from TED, where can you do that?
It would become a major fundamental source of energy --
And also, we're working to use the same metods to create vaccinistantaneously.
You saw this year with influence, we're always background of a year and dollar, when you treat least when you treat the right time to find the right vaccine.
I think that that this can change building vaccinable vaccinable in ancient ant.
Here's how the future could start to change it seem, now, the tree of evolution, accelerating evolution with synthetic bacteria with synthetic synthetic batterian arbatterian arce.
We're so much to improve people.
Our purpose is to make a long way to try to make it cheffort. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
First, I will just show you the most quicker possible, some fundamental work that we took to Microsoft in the followed a year ago in followed a year ago.
It's a environment where you can interact is a local level, which remote with a huge amount of visual data in visual data --
And here we are seeing a lot of gabyte photo a lot of constants with a kind of coast, and continuous fast, he saying the pictures as we want to do.
And it doesn't matter how big the amount of information that we see, how big these data pieces of data or images.
Most are digital photographs, but this for example, it's a scansion of the Congress, and it's a coming scansion from Bilibrary of Congress, and reents in the game.
It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that limits the number of a system like this is the number of place on your screen in any time. It's also a very flexible. It's also a very flexible.
This is a book book from data not to imagine data not to image.
This is the Dickens. Every Casa Dickens. Each cool represents a capitly.
To show you that it is just textbooks, we can do something like to do something like to see that is a real representation of a real representation of the head of text, not a picture.
It could be a little artificial way to read a book electronic book --
You don't think it was a little bit of it.
This is a more realistic. It's a number of The Guardian number of The Guardian for Guardian examp.
Each image is the beginning of a section.
And it really gives you really like pleasure and the beautiful experience of a news or a news of a newspaper or a news of a quotidic half of a half a lot of half a lot of half a lot of half a lot of half a lot of half a lot of half a lot
We also did something with the angle of this number of the Guardian angle of the Guardian angle of this number of Guardian angle of this number of of of the Guardian angle of this number of of the Guardian angle of this number of the Guardian angle of this number of of the Guardian
We created a high advertising of high resolution, much higher -- much higher than in a normal publish. And we insert the content -- and we insert in the normal content -- and we inserve in a normal content -- and we inserve in a normal of the content -- and we inserve in a norma
If you want to see the characteristics of this cartoon, you can see here.
Or other models, or even specific specific specific models,
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space.
We hope that this means to put pop-up and other similar to other similar to be necessary.
Of course, map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology.
And I don't want to lose time, if we don't want to say that we have contributes to be allowed to be allowed to be a camp.
These are all the roads in the U.S. is a geospatial image of NASA.
So now we go to something else.
This is actually from living on the webs; you can go and see it.
This is a project called Photosynth, which combined two different technologies.
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual research, very interesting researching in Noah Snavely, a student of Washington with the aid of Seitz Seitz of Microsoft Resear. Seitz Seitz of Microsoft Resch. Seeechurch.
And it's from the web, I gested by Seadragononon.
You can see it when we do this kind of screen where we can go from one picture and have this kind of experience to the other experience to multiple.
But the space of the pictures here has actually actually actually a meaning.
The chanities of visualization of the computer recorded these pictures together, so that the real imagine. And the real slide-scening -- all the neighborhood. And the Canadesires -- have been taken canadisease. Whatever you see elements of a slide-show shows a space. And these things are all college of the space.
I don't know if I have time to show you some other environment.
There are some more space space.
I want to go directly to one of the original data set -- and this is from a previous previous protynth that we did work. And this is a working for the first time you do to show you what I think is the key to show you what I think is the key to be the key to be the clear, technology Photosynth. And it's not necessaring the environments that we have put in the webbb.
We had to worry about legal aspects and so on.
This is a rebuilding in Notre Dame pictures made by Flickr. Basta digitate in Flickr. Basta digital types in the major images of the camp, other of the field of the arange of this cones that is a picture that is a picture that is a model.
So they are all pictures from Flickr and were all colleged to space in this way.
And it's possible to navigate in this simple.
You know, I would never think I was thinking about to work for Microsofts.
It's very free to get this kind of acres to get this kind of columns here.
I think you can see that it's a lot of different kinds of focuses of focuses to the photos of the phones in the SLR, a significant number of of significant phones in this environment.
And if you can try to get those strange strange.
Most are they going to do this, etc.
And somewhere here is a series of photographs -- this is -- this is --
This is a Notre Dame recorded Notre Dame recorded correctly.
We can go from the poster physics of this environment.
The essential point is that we can do things with the social environment. This is taking data from the entire memory of view -- and it all of these view -- and it all those data together.
All of those photos become together, more than the slight-sum of the parts.
You have a model of the land that is emerge.
Think of this as the model of Stephen Lawler on the virtual lander
It's something that is growing in complexity as people using that people useful and the advantages for people to use the use.
Their photos are hands with other people.
If somebody comes to contrast all these sants saying the name of these sants saying the name of Notre Dame suddenly Dame suddenly re-up and use all of those data, and I can use it as a point of engine, using the photograph, using the photographs of anyone else, and have an social experience of the smoke and the cross-user.
Of course, a consequence of all this is that are extremely elaborated virtual model, and so on. It doesn't only only only views from the plane and similar to imagine and similes, but by memories.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: What your software will shared to do is that in your software will shared to do is that in the next years, all the photographs shared everyone in the world will be practically connect together?
BA: Yeah. What is doing is basically to discover.
It's creating hyperlinks, if you want to be in the images.
And it's doing it basically in the base content of the images.
And it becomes very interesting if you think about the rich information that many of these images.
As when you do a research of images on the web, and the head has a lot of information about the web has a lot of information about the pictures.
Now, what happens if that picture is connected to all your picture?
So the amount of interconnection and the amount of real-wealth that is really enormous -- it's really enormous effect. It's a big classic.
CA: Blaise, it's really incredible. Compliments.
BA: Thank you very much.
One of the major when you travels and one of the etho's research is the power to live between who has no anti-traditional research between the wind, the wind of the machine, it in the wind of the plants.
You think that the sliamamans Jaguar is still beyond the Vily Milky Way, or that the people are still holdless to be significantly significant for the breath, and the idea that in Himalaya, to remember the respire maintain the respire Dharma, and the idea that the world we don't have a sense of sense of reality, but it's just a reality, but it's just a reality,
the consequence of a particular set of adaptations that our stirps has done or melt bad, many generations ago.
And of course, we all share of essential tracks.
We all all of it. We all procree.
We're subjected to began to beginning.
We have to deal with the inexorm, so we don't surprised and so we don't surprised and and balliam, and we don't surprise.
We all have a art art.
What you colpiss is the rhythm of the song of every culture.
It doesn't matter that they are the Borism, or the Borneo, or the Voodoo doo warriors of Haiti, or the Kai's desert in Kenya section, or a camel, the Curans of the Ans, or a camelius.
He was my journey in the desert of journey in the desert of yak in the world of Qomolangma, on the Everest, the mother of the world.
All these people teaching us that there are other ways to think there are other ways of thinking, other ways of thinking, other ways of thinking, other ways of moving in the world.
And if you reflect a moment, it's a concept that can give you hope.
And so we see, the miries of cultures create a ragnact and cultural life and cultural and cultural raises and it's important for the planet and is important for the planet as a biological ragnatela as biological ragnificent note as biological ragn.
And you can think of this rather cultural as a ethnose as an ethnose and you can call the ethnose the ephere is the sum total of all concept, and intuitions became from the human imagination from the hands of the consciation from the consciousness of the consciousness of the consciousness of the concept.
The ethnose equipment of humanity.
It's the symbol of what we are and what we are and what we can be in as species.
And as the biosphere was free to be consumed higher on ethnose and purposes and purposes much more quickly.
No biology, for example, it would say 50 percent of all species was on the order of the extinction because it's false is fall, or -- in the most apocalitty -- in the most pocalitty -- and you don't even near the popular of popular diversity.
The indication of all of this is, of course, the language.
When you're born there were 6,000 languages on this planet.
One language is not just by a vocabulary or from a series of rules gramatter to the gramatter of rules.
One is the language of the human spirit of the human spirit of spirit spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the human spirit of spirit spirit of the human spirit of the spirit of the human spirit of the spirit of the human spirit of spirie.
It's the means that the soul that animation is in the material of the world
Every language is a forest of mind, a thinking, a thinking, a thinking, a spiritual ecosystem of spiritual chance of spiritual chance of spiritual chance of spiritual chance of mind, a spiritual ecosystem of mind, a spiritual system.
And of those 6,000 languages while we are here sitting here in Monterey, at least half the half of children.
They don't get more teached to children, which means that they don't change something, which is already to be dead.
What is there is more than being flew from silence, of being the last few of the last to be the last few of the availing not to transmit the wisdom of the children's had.
This is a fall, in some part of the world every two weeks: every two weeks a little bit of a weeks: every two weeks with the last sillabe of a ancient language.
And I know somebody of you will tell "Is it not better way?
The world would not be a better place, if we all sleep, we all parlive yorba. We talk yorbua. We talk yorba. We talk about the yor.
Let's talk to the way.
You'll be able to be a tract that you can't talk about their language.
And I would like to do a journey through equalness through ethnos:
a little journey in ethnose efs to give you a little bit of what we're going to lost.
Most of us forget that when I say "different ways of existing really different existers.
Let's take for example, this birth Barasan Amazon settly, and the anaconda, which creates to the mixture of the anaconda, which creates to the milk of the best skin the milk of sacris.
It's a popular popular that is not able to distinguishing the blue color, because the time is identify identify in the forest, which is depends on the forest, which is the popular popular popular color.
They have a strange language and a matheme rule, called "languageful language, "Looks, you have a different language.
Everything has been in the past, all of the particular mystic, is that in these families are talking about six or seven languages that are talking about six or seven marriages because of the mystics of a language.
They listen to listen to and then start talking about.
Let's take one of the most interesting tribes that I lived in the Waorans of Ecuador in 1958. And an incredible popular popular that had the first contact in 1958.
In 1957 mission mission in 1957 five, they had a fact that a fact that was a fact that
They did the site photographs that they would return them into the write that they would forget that this popular popular of the forest, never seen anything about the birth of the forest.
They collected the ground, they gave them to research of a shape or a shape or a figura and they kill out that it was the diavol, and they kill killed the five of the mission with the lances.
But Waoranans didn't just kill the strangers.
They keat between them.
Five percent of mortality was caused by them in their own own own own own own own own one.
We're risalites to eight generations and we found two of natural death and when we insisted for knowledge that one of them was so that one of them was so that they had been instead of a forest. And then they kill it killed it to the same.
The hunters were able to recognize the animal from 40 steps and recognize the species.
In the early '80s, it was assigned a very interesting compiece of Harvard when my professor Haiti asked me if I wanted to go to Haiti in the power of the power of Duvarier and Tonton Macoutes, and I impossessed to make the base of the elvel, and impossess.
To give a sense to miracle Vodn culture Vodn culture Vodn and that the Voodoo is not nera.
It's a complex of a complex metaphysics of the world.
Very interesting.
If I asked to tell me the big religions of the world, what are you would say, what would you say?
Cristianism, Buddhym, Buddhism, Elers.
A continent, and let me thinking that Africa is sub-Saharan Africa, and he didn't have feeling and the Voodoo doo and the Voodoo doo deep these religious concepts of the slave that the tragics of the slave of the slave of the slave of the slave of the slave of the slave is that the slave of the slave is that the distill.
What makes you interesting your own is the intense is the intense between life and death.
So the live live to the spirits.
You spirits can be invocked by the Great the Aqua, respond to the dance of the dancy and they replacing temporary to the soul, so that for a shortal house to the dio.
So you know, you love to say "You white love to go to church of God.
We damn in the temple, and we become God."
And from the moment you are going to be drive, is the spirit that you drive, how can you do it a bad?
So you see these incredibly events that you can see the state, I follow the test that touching points infurefure-power demonstration of the body when they bad in a state of excited excited in a state of excited in in a state of excited excited in in a state of excited excited in the state of the body when it's catalyzes of the body in the state of the body when they bad in a state of exciting exciting exciting in the state of the body in the body when you have been a state of the body in the body in the extre
And all the people that I lived in the most extraordinary Kogi is the Kogi Santa Marta, in Santa Marta, in the Santa Mar, in Santa Mar, in Santa Santa Santa Santa Marta,
Sombidd of civilization that once they lived on the foot of Colombia in the attention to the conquer of the conquer conquer was going on the massive vulcanic plan.
In a macchief, this popular continent, this popular has never been conquer by the spagnos.
At the today, I have government by a clinline, but their formation is really extraordinary to be very extraordinary
The young people followed from the family to three or four years, and they live in a world made of good and they live in a world made of a good shadow in the glaciers for 18 years.
Two nine years choices to make nine years to reproduce nine months that spent in the user of the mother, now I'm metaphorically in the utrial Greand.
So for that time, they get acculate to the values of their society, values that predict and their preachers and only their praying their own cosmic balance, or to say the balance.
And in terms of this incredible initiation, they are suddenly carred out and for the first time in life, at 18 years, they see a albe. And in that active awareness of the first bad, when the suns of the first badlands of the beautiful way: everything that they learned in theory, everything that they learned in theory is a passeeing.
"Do you see how I said to you.
It's just stuff is to you."
They call the bigger brothers and say that we do, brothers are the minor, we are the folded of the world.
This level of intuition is extremely important.
When we think about people and invoice the environment and the environment, and the old story of the wild history of the wild history or maybe Thoreasy Thoreah. And we think these popules are closer to the Earth of us.
The indigenes are not feeling feeling of the indebules of our algies.
There is no space for these things in the palues of the Asmat the gelies of the Tibet, but because of the time and they created a mystical meystic of the Earth is not about the concept of human beings but on an intuition of the Earth: the concept that the Earth can live because it's infusing from the consciously because it's infusing from the human conscious of the human conscious --

Maybe some of you have heard about ayahua's psychoice, the most powerful psychoactive of the repertor slips.
What makes it fascinating the ayaxis is not the dyaxis is not the done of the character, but his element. It's compoem to two elements.
On one hand, this lian lian. This lian legnotion that cont is a series of beta-carboline, harmine and harmwell.

To be that police on for the nose is a little bit like being shooted by a smoke distore, and the lands and land and to land and to land on a distore. It doesn't create a distore.
I was often with my professor, Richard Evan Shultes, the man who was done the psychedelic, with his psychedelic, with his discovering fungion in the '30s.
Second my testhesis you can classified these triptames like hallucinogens because if you're not going to tell anybody where. Somebody of being absolutely because they are dened by an in-half of course, because they are denied by an in-half-oxized in the intestine, you know, it's a resive, and it can be about.
It's possible to him the reaches that are all the chemices that have MAO.
Now it's the beauti: the beta-carbolins that are in this lian's bitors of MAO, the same kind of need to potential to potentially potentially -- in a floating 80,000 species of plants, like these popules are not as much as these popules that are two deads of the particular death is such about the sum of the particular death that is sumer to the particular version of the particular thing?

This tribe, Cof, Cof, 17 variety of ayaas, which are born in the forest, and that to our eyes are going to go into the same species.
If you ask them how they are they going to tell us how they are they going to tell us what plant, I thought plant, the rest of the rest doesn't you know everything about this?"
The solution is taking 17 varieties in a night of a baside and each night with a different tun.
With you don't have to Harvard, but it's much more interesting than to count the mosts.
Now, the problem is that also the problem is that the people who have heart to heart the indigenes are pitches and in some way to the margins of the history of the real world -- and it goes to our real world our real real world and it goes to our real real world and it goes to our real world and it goes to be there.
In fact, in fact, in 300 years, in 300 years, it will not be remember for the wars or the technologies, but rather as the extra technologies, but rather as we have stopped and we have been stopped and we have to stop the problem of biological diversity and cultural diversity and cultural issue is not the change.
All cultures through the century have been involved in a dance for new possibility of life.
And the problem is not technology.
Indians Soux Indians have not been stopped to be Sioux when they put it up and frecks so like Americans have not stopped to be Americans when they put out of the horsed.
It's not the change or technology that they threat the integrity of ethnose.
The during the domination.
And if you look at the world, you will discover that these are not destiny cultures that are not shape.
They're living creatures and dynamics out of existence to be identify by identify their ability of adaptations.
What you can see you expect in the patria of the Penan:

As you know the genocide extinction of a popular -- is convicted to universal level, but the ethnocide of a popular level, not only is not just convicted by the way, but addicted, but addicted, but adriddly.
And you can't understand the suffering of Tibet until you part of the beginning.
I have spent 6,000 miles from China in Western China in the Western Cina in the Western Cina with a young college, but only came to Lhasa young and I realized what we heard about it.

The big anthropologists before he died her greatest says that his greatest fear was that, in our view of the world, we don't just see the whole gam, we will not just see the whole gamm of human imagination of the human imagination of thought, but a day, but a day, we can see it from a sleep.
And it's humming that our species is existed for 600,000 years.
The Neolitics that again that given us the agriculture, which has done to the cult of seeding the seeding poetry with the poek, creating the gerarchia clinerary, and we talk about 10,000 years ago.

That shark story not suggests that we have the answers to all the challenges that we have to come up to the millennia.
When these myriades of the world is asked what it means to be human, answer with 10,000 different voices.
And it's in these answers that we all all response to be what we are going to be what we are. a conscious species and we all the beautiful popules and all the bears can true. And there are big moments of optimism.
I took this picture on the north of Buil's Inu, when I went to hunt with the Inuity, and this man, Olaya, he told me with the beautiful story of his grandfather.
The canadese is not always always as much as a people in the Inuit and in the '50s to stabilide our sound in colonies.
The grandfather of this man refused to go and out of it.
The family, them, I was in his life, he took all the arms, and all of his arms.

We want to talk about the caves with nothing?
In the opening 19999, the canadese government of a territorial control of a territorial land.
It's their new basia. It's called Nunavut.
It's an independent territorial. They are all the resources.
One of the beautiful example of how a country that can reconciliate with his popular people.
And for finally, I think it's pretty obvious at least to those of us is in these places of the planet, realize that they don't have remoted.

in which the wisdoms can contribute to our well-being that is to our well-well-being that
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some things I wrote in this book that I hope I call other than I hope and I will try to head some other collegments, in case not notice.
I would start with what I call the officale."
The official dog, official dog,
The dogmaster of all the Western societies industrial societies. The equal dogmam is to male well-being, "If we want to massive the well-being, "The way to make individual freedom."
The reason that is from one side, in the fact that the freedom is in the same value, is precious, useful, useful, essential human beings.
One of the other is that if we are free, each of us can act to do everything that massive our well-being, without any one that decided in our name.
The way to massive liberty is to male is to simize the choice.
More people choices are liber, and more liber, and more is their freedom, and more cheap is their well.
And this is so deeply radicated in society that nobody would dream of himself to put it in two-fashion.
And it's also deeply in our lives.
I'm going to show you some examples of what progressive has possible.
This is my supermarket. It's not particularly large.
I put a simple named on a simple named on the sky.
In my supermarket there are 175 conditions, without containing 10 vets of oil oil and 12 acets of oil acets and 12 acets across the samic across the circumstances that you can buy a number of mindset that nobody of the rest of your degree and is of your degree of your gradiment.
Here's the supermarket.
And then you go to electronics to buy a stere: CD, CD, Blettor CD, radio Blector Blifields.
And in this single snegotial of electronics, there's a big number of audio of audio --
We can make six million different combinations of different combinations using components that there are only a store of the same.
You have to admit that there is a lot of choice.
Other field: the world of communications.
One time, when I was a child, you could get all the time to get all the services that were provided to be wish, so they could have all the mom Bell.
And he was reading the phone, you didn't buy it out.
One consequence of that, in the other one was that the phone doesn't break it up.
These are the time today.
Now we have a varietized varietized varieties between cellphones between cells.
Here's the future.
My favorite is the middle, MP3, cut, and the high of the hidden for the crash myself in the middle of the crase.
If you have no time you saw it in the house store under house, you're going to be able to get revery.
And what happens is that people go into the same, and do this question and do this question and do this question is "No."
It's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn't make too much of it.
So, in other aspects of life that are much more important than the water is the same explosion of choice.
Assistance, it doesn't happen, it happens in the United States that you go from the doctor and the doctor and the doctor and the doctor of the doctor and the doctor and the doctor and the doctor and the doctor and the doctor and the doctor and the doctor and the doctor and the doctor and the doctor and the doctor and the doc
Instead, you go to the doctor says, "Okay, we could do A, or B" -- you could do A, and you know, "B" is these things and these risk" and these risks. What do you want to do?"
You know, what would I do that?"
And the doctor says, "It has these goods, and Bs have these risky-benefits and these risk."
"What do you want to do?"
And you know, if you were to be whether she was here?"
And the doctor, "But I'm not here."
The result of the result of the malato," expression that it makes a beautiful thing.
But in fact, it's not that one to move the weight and responsibility to make somebody else that something, which is the doctor, and somebody else is not a -- and so in conditional conditional to take the patient.
There is a huge marketing products, whether you know, if you think of it has no sense, you know, if you think it has no sense, it has no sense, that we can't buy it.
But if we can't buy them, why do you published them do?
The answer is that they want domatter to call the doctor.
Something that is our identity as our identity is a question of choice, as you see in this vignet, we don't want to force the children. We don't want to be their own sex moment. We have to invent to be the right now.
And we can reinvention us how many times we can get it in it.
which means that every morning, you have to decide that the type of person.
Rispspace and the marriage, a common, a common, and you know, I was that you could get the most pretty much as possible, and it was that you could well the pretty much as possible.
The only one true choice was with choice, not the one-bounds, and what to do later.
Ogame, it's really to play.
I teach them very smart students and I think about 20 percent of work than a time.
And because they are less brilliant, because they are less diligent.
but why are they unthink, I meanentre I would like to ask me or I should be married or now?"
"I should be married? I have to think before I have I got to think before the kids or career?"
They're interrogative logorients.
And they try to answer these questions, even if this implements don't completely to make a chance and not get a well to my exam.
And they have to do that. They're really important.
Now, work: we are lucky, like Carl World is because technology allows us to work every minute, every day, from every day, from every single planet, trans that from Hotel Randolph.
Twentese, there's a corner, and I won't tell anybody where, where the WiFi works.
I don't say that, because I want to use it.
What does this mean, this incredible liberty liberty that we have to work on the work? Is that we have to decide and continuously in every time. If we need to work or not.
We can go to the hot on the hot cell with the cell phone in a tas, the Blackberry in the other, and the knon-knels on the knee.
And even though they're all frightening, every minutes that we see our boy to save the game, we are also asking this call?"
"I have to answer this email? I have to able?"
And even when the answer is "no," this makes the experience of your child very different type from what would be in other conditions.
So, anywhere we look at things and large things and large materials and big materials and life, life is a question of life, life is a question of choice.
Once the world was this: Okay, there were some choice, but it was a question of choice.
The world today is like this: The dilemma is, "Is it is a positive, or negative negative now?"
The answer is She knows that.
The positive sides we know everybody else is that negative negative to the bad of the negative balls.
All this choice two negative effects on the people.
The first one, paradoxis that produces instead of liberation.
With many options that you choose, it becomes very difficult to do it.
I offer an example meaning that an example of a conduction plans of volunteers.
One of my college had access to the Vanchemenge of though, giant society with about a million clients of though, with about a million clients in 2,000 different companies.
What she has discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are offered and more and more and the percentage of adesion.
With 50 sources is 10 percent in less than the desions of when they are available only 5. Why?
Because with 50 sources that choose, is they have to decide is to decide and choices are remained to the indemate in questions.
And the question and questions, and asked question, and of course, questions and questions that questions and we don't see.
You know, it doesn't just mean that these workers will not only food, because they don't have enough food for cans because they don't have enough money, it also means that the decision is so ostic that they lose the foundations of work.
They don't participated, they're losing to 5000, and they are losing to work that would be well willing to cross-deph it.
So the paralysis of having too many choices.
And I think it makes the world like this.
"And for the ethnity: ketchup, or major maion?"
You would just take the right decision if it's for the right decision if it's for ethis?
You don't want to choose the wrong source, and neps the wrong condition.
So this is the first effect. The second is that even if we can avoid the paralysis and make a choice, we end end end up the result of how we would be states with less options that we would have been been with less options that we would have been choice.
And this for several reasons.
One of these is that with a lot of conditional feeling that you would have to be able to pick up and it's not easy to imagine that you could make a different choice. And what happens is that you could make a different choice, and the heat of the choice, and the resea better choice, and the decreases of choice, and the remains of the real-dempide sodden that you could have been a pressure that it was going to be better at the make.
even when it was a very good decision.
More choices are easy to be easy to any details that it is insodden to be choice.
And also, there's what economists are called cost-opportunities.
Dan Gilbert asked a lot of bad stack like value that we are the value of things that we confront what we confront with it.
And in the rest of that, when there are many options to be easy the characteristics of alternative and become less satisfacts of the option that you have choice.
Here's an example. I suspect with all the ones that are not New York.
But that's what you probably think you probably are.
There is this couply to Hamptons.
A place of luxight.
Spidden splendid. One type of them.
Nothing that he thinks is nothing that he thinks is "Well, the illustration."
"Everybody my neighbors are alien a."
"I could talk to the front of house."
And it spends two weeks away from the idea that is losing -- every day, that is losing -- the chance of parking where he wants to get it.
The expensive opportunities decreation for what we have, even when the choices was excellent.
And more are the options that we have to consider the more characteristics will be returning us out to be as a coast-opportunities.
Here's another example.
This is a lot of things that I think about a lot of things.
It talks about live moment, and maybe of live live to live live to live it.
But the most important point is that anything you choices you choose you don't do others.
The things that we don't choosing a lot of four active that can make less attenthures that we do.
Third point: growing spiral growing waiting.
I tried on my skin, I was buying a new jeans.
I think about almost jeans.
Once jeans were just a type, they were bestive and clothed them and clothed a life, and they were comfortable to get them and worked a lot of times and worked a lot of times, they started to go good.
So I went to buy a couple new when the old were old and I said, "I need a couple of jeans, this is my cuteans, this is my cute."
The committed said, "Would you like slim fitted, and asy fit?"
He wants to try and the certain or bottons "Wed" or ""Wed" or ""?
"Liks you want to break them up?"
"Sots eight is you or strettty? Big blah blah --
I was a wise, and after a little I could say, "I want the type -- that was the only typoth." It wasn't that idea that I was a only one idea that I was so for all of the women called jeans, and then I got the best jeans, and then I got the best guys I had ever been able to say, "I would have ever done it.
It was the male one. And on the whole choice.
But I felt worse I was worse.
Why? I wrote a book to understand it.
The reason I was worse for which I was worse with all of my waiting for my mine was altissue, the jeans had to be perfected.
And I began wait minimes. I didn't expect anything else when I just was a type, but when you see 100 different in the way 100 different ways. But when I saw a perfect.
What I had water was good, but not perfect.
And after that I was choiced what I was trying to get what I was trying to get in confront to the waiting for it.
The adds of options in life of people don't do that to expectations that these have respectives of the excellence.
And this will produce less sodden when the results are good good enough when the results are good good.
Nobody in the world marketing it makes it content.
Because if you know what I'm talking about, you won't know what I'm talking about.
The truth truth is more like this.
"You were better when it was worse when it was worse when it was worse when it was worse when it was worse when it was worse when it was worse in the worse that when it was worse in the mistakes.
Or in the world we live -- opuly industrialized -- opuly industrializen with the perfection -- the massive that we can hope is that we can hope is that things are to be expectationship.
You never have to be surprised because your own waiting for your waitts, my miles and waiting and and they are injuried.
The secret of happiness -- what you're here -- is what you're here -- "Yes, you know, "Yes, you want it."
I mean, small time authobiographic moment, which are really wrong and my wife is really amazing up.
I wasn't going to have to do better, I don't have any exacted.
But you don't always get a bad thing.
And finally, a consequence of buying a couple of jeans comfortable jeans is that when you don't mean when you're not such a little bit of a jeans is that when you don't have to ask you, "Why?"
"Who is responsible?" "The answer is clear.
The world is responsible. What could I do I do?
When there are hundreds of jeans of jeans and you buy a charge insods, and you ask the responsible is the responsible to you are there.
You could do it better.
With hundreds of varietizing disease, there are not for the insuccess.
So when people take decisions, even if the outcome, you feel that is a valike, they feel insodsed and they make the same.
In the last years the last years the depression is explosively in the industrialized world.
I think a significant factor -- not the unique, but important -- of this depression is that people have experiences because people have experiences because the standard standard standard is too high.
And when they have to explain this situation think that the colp,
So the final result is that in general is that we are best, objectively but we feel worse.
Let me remind you you --
This is the official dog, what we all take for good and it's completely false.
There's no two-bedable that a little bit of choices that you don't have that that many choices is better than a lot of a little bit better than a little bit.
There's a critical value, magic value. I don't know what it is.
But I'm sure we have been safe from a piece of the level that we have the best choices that choices our lives.
Now, from the political point -- I have almost finished -- from the point of view, the following is the following it.
What it allows all this choices in the industrial society is material reches.
There are many places in the world, and you know that they have a lot of places that problem is they have choice.
The problem is that they have too much of it.
So the fact that I'm talking about is a bad bad bad, receiving companies.
And what it does and arrabbby-beautiful is this: Steve Levitt talked about how you expensive and seats are useful. It's a wastste of money.
I mean, these choices, complicated and dispended, is not that they are just useful useful.
They're addicted.
They're worse.
If you are a little bit of what our societies allowed to be reversed in those where people have too popular chance is not just their life improving for themselves.
This is what economists are called a better paretian paretian paretian paretian paretian paretian paretian paretian paretian paretian.
One ridical reddial redd-down, not just to poor -- because of this choices in excess that we get back to us.
And so he said, "Oh, you can become everything that you want,
You know, people of culture, you know, what are you going to think that weight
"It's obvious that you can't make anything in a vetron bought to a vetro."
"As imagination, a fall, a limited view of the world."
and I was going to be able to do this at the beginning.
But then, thinking, I realized that weight the long long way that weight the long way that weight the long time.
Because the reality of the facts is that if you go to frank the mouth of the facts that you don't get freedom. You do it not get freedom.
If you break the mouth of it all become possible to decreate the sodsatisfacation.
You can get the paralysis, and you reduce the well.
They need a sphere.
This is almost certainly too strectly, perhaps even for weight, and securly for us.
But the absence of some symbolic symbolic sphere is a recipe for infelicity --
Thank you very much.
