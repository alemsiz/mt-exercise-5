<unk> year I showed these <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk>, which for almost three million years had the size of the United States <unk>, <unk>, has been <unk> <unk> of 40 percent.
We're going to <unk> this <unk> of the problem because it doesn't show the ice of the <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> is, in a way, the heart of the <unk> of the global warming.
It's <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
The next <unk> will be a <unk> <unk> on the last 25 years.
The <unk> <unk> are <unk> in red.
You see, you're <unk> up to the blue <unk>.
That's the ice in <unk>, which is <unk> summer.
You can see that the <unk> ice <unk>, of five years or more, is like the blood, that's like the blood here, which is <unk> from the body.
In 25 years, it's been in 25 years, so.
This is a problem because the <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> around the ocean where there are enormous <unk> of <unk> that, <unk>, are <unk> in <unk> by <unk>.
<unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk>, that amount could <unk>, that <unk> could <unk>, <unk> this point of not <unk>.
In some <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> is already <unk> <unk> from water.
The <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with a team <unk> team last <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>! <unk>: She's OK. The question is if we <unk> it is, we also.
A reason is that this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from the north.
This is a river in <unk> <unk>.
It's <unk> never <unk> <unk>.
This is the <unk> <unk>, in the <unk> of <unk>.
If you want to know how the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, here is where the sea.
These <unk> are <unk> <unk>.
On the other part of the planet: <unk>, the greatest <unk> of ice on the planet.
<unk> month scientists have <unk> <unk> that the <unk> of ice is in <unk>, and that <unk> <unk> on some <unk> <unk>, is particularly <unk> in <unk>.
<unk> at six feet of the level of the <unk>, as in <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, the third bigger <unk> of ice, you see new <unk>, that a few years ago were <unk>.
<unk> percent of the world's population <unk> water from that <unk>.
<unk> <unk>: this <unk> is the water source of this city.
The <unk> is <unk>.
But when you <unk>, the same happens to the water itself.
In California, <unk> on the <unk> <unk> is <unk> 40 percent.
<unk> <unk> are in the crisis.
<unk>, like you read, are <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> in the world <unk> to a <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> are <unk> out of the normal <unk> and without <unk>.
We're going to <unk> over the last 30 years of the <unk> of the <unk>.
This is a <unk> of the whole <unk>.
If you look in the context of the <unk>, if you can see the <unk>.
In the last five years we've <unk> 70 million <unk> of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million <unk> in the oceans every day.
Look at the area of the <unk> <unk>, from <unk>, to <unk>, and on both parts of the <unk> <unk>, where there's a <unk> <unk> of oxygen in the oceans.
The greater cause of global warming, together with <unk>, which is 20 percent, is the use of <unk> <unk>.
<unk> is a problem, and <unk> is even worse.
The United States is one of the two countries with more emissions, together with China.
And it's <unk> to build a lot of other <unk> <unk>.
But we're <unk> to a <unk> direction.
These are the projects <unk> in the last few years and some <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
And so, there's a <unk> politics in our country.
<unk> <unk> and oil <unk> have <unk> <unk> million dollars in the last year to <unk> <unk>, which is a <unk>.
I'm going to give you something --
<unk> <unk>, where I live, there was a <unk> of <unk> billion <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
Maybe you saw it on the <unk>.
This is the second <unk> of <unk> in America.
It's happened around <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> of one of the <unk> <unk> was this.
<unk>: <unk> â™« <unk> is a <unk> and happy.
It's <unk> here in America, and <unk> our economy.
<unk> the <unk> is <unk> <unk>.
It's <unk>, <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> is from here, <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The greatest <unk> society <unk> on the <unk> is <unk> <unk>. This is his <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> <unk>: <unk> <unk> -- Al <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> -- they don't know what they're talking about.
<unk>: So, the <unk> <unk> <unk> two <unk>.
This is one of them, one part.
<unk>: <unk>: <unk> we see the <unk> changes as a <unk> <unk> to our business.
So, our <unk> is <unk> a big amount of money in a <unk> <unk> to make public and <unk> the truth on <unk>.
In fact, <unk> is not <unk>.
We think it's <unk> -- it's also a good <unk>.
So we don't <unk> of the climate change.
We're going to do it.
<unk>: <unk> <unk> -- you've heard a lot of it.
So we <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk>.
<unk>! <unk> machines are a little <unk>, but this is the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> technology.
<unk> <unk> is between the major <unk> of global warming, but the <unk> technology of <unk> that you see changes everything.
Let's look at this: the <unk> <unk> technology.
<unk>: <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to the economic issue and the national security.
<unk>: <unk>: <unk> America is in the crisis; the economy, national security crisis.
The <unk> that we all <unk>: our <unk> <unk> <unk>, like <unk> and <unk> oil <unk>.
Now, but, there's a new, <unk> solution to <unk>.
<unk> America: 100 percent of <unk> energy in 10 years.
A plan to <unk> America to work, <unk> more <unk>, and to help <unk> global warming.
<unk>, a solution that we <unk> to solve our problems.
<unk> America. <unk> more.
<unk>: This is the last.
<unk>: <unk>: It's about <unk> energy to America.
One of the most <unk> ways of <unk> <unk> to <unk> from the <unk> that we <unk> our planet.
<unk>: The future is here. <unk>, sun, a new <unk> network.
<unk> <unk> two: <unk> <unk> <unk> for jobs <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> America. It's time to be <unk>.
<unk>: A <unk> <unk> <unk> says, "If you want to go <unk>, go alone.
If you want to go far, go together. "
We have to go away, quickly.
Thank you very much.
<unk> year I did a <unk> on the <unk>.
And we're going to <unk> it up how the machine works.
So there's. And for those who didn't have, the <unk> is the greatest scientific experiment ever <unk> -- <unk> miles of <unk>.
His task is to <unk> the conditions that were <unk> less than a <unk> of a second from the beginning of the universe -- until <unk> million times a second.
This is just <unk>.
This is the <unk> machine.
They <unk> these <unk> <unk> into the <unk>.
This is what I'm working on. It's called <unk> -- <unk> feet and it's <unk> feet and it's <unk> feet.
This is a <unk> picture of <unk> in building so you can see the <unk>.
<unk> <unk> last year we <unk> the machine for the first time.
And this picture was <unk> by <unk>.
It was <unk> by <unk> <unk> in control.
It's a picture of the first <unk> of particles that he had all been around the <unk>, <unk>, with a part of the <unk>, and <unk> particles inside the <unk>.
In other words, when you <unk> that picture 10 <unk>, we'll see that the <unk> machine, which is a great <unk>.
I don't know if it was this to do <unk> <unk>, or this, when somebody <unk> on Google and <unk> that the <unk> page was this.
That means we've had a <unk> impact over to the scientific.
And we had a week later, there was a problem with the machine, we had to just these <unk> <unk> here -- these <unk> <unk> <unk>.
These <unk> <unk> <unk> when the car works in the <unk> of the <unk>.
Now, the <unk> of you <unk> the <unk> and <unk>, "It's not true. I'm <unk> too <unk>."
And instead they can do it because when they're very <unk> <unk>.
So, <unk> degrees, at a temperature <unk> to the <unk> of the space between the stars, these <unk> can bring that <unk> that <unk>.
In one of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, there was a <unk> of <unk>.
So the <unk> <unk>, and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a electric <unk>.
This was the result.
Now, this is even more <unk> if you think that these <unk> <unk> <unk> over 20 <unk>, and that have <unk> about 30 <unk>.
It's about 50 <unk>.
We were <unk>, what we did.
We <unk> them and <unk>.
They're now <unk> everybody's <unk> to their <unk> place.
And we'll be the end of <unk> <unk> will be again.
We <unk> it, and we try to get some data to <unk> or <unk>, and continue so our <unk> to discover what are the universe are.
Now, of course, in a way, these <unk> <unk> the <unk> of science and engineering <unk>.
I think the fact that is so hard, the fact of going to go beyond the <unk>, I think this is the value of things like <unk>.
I'd like to end with the words of a <unk> <unk>, <unk>, who, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, in <unk> of the <unk> experiments of the <unk>, his <unk> was Michael <unk>, said, "No <unk> so <unk> to the <unk> of the human mind as the <unk> that the ideas of science are <unk>, that we don't have in nature, that we're <unk> <unk>.
Thank you.
I want to start <unk> <unk> to when, from children, <unk> with <unk>.
As we were <unk> as <unk> and <unk> and <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, actually to think and <unk> problems.
The <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> to the way we <unk> most of the world around us.
So, as a <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of our <unk> with <unk>, and my <unk> <unk>, and my <unk> <unk> <unk>, I started <unk>, I started <unk>, I started <unk>, and if we use a computer, instead of having the <unk> <unk> as a digital <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> an information <unk> with both hands,
and we <unk> to our <unk>?
The question was so interesting that we could try to explore the answer, building <unk>.
In a few words, a <unk> is a computer <unk> <unk> like a <unk>.
In a few words, a <unk> is a computer <unk> <unk> like a <unk>.
You can <unk> them with their hand, they can say, "<unk>" <unk> "and have a <unk> <unk>.
But <unk>, they're <unk> objects, like <unk>, you can just <unk>.
The <unk> are the example of a new <unk> to <unk> digital information.
And as they become more <unk>, <unk> of their own movement, other, and as they become more <unk>, <unk> of their own movement, other, of how we can <unk> new and <unk> <unk>.
We're going to start with some simple example.
This <unk> is <unk> to show you some video: if you put it in a direction, the <unk> <unk>, if you put it in a direction, you can get it back.
These <unk> <unk> are <unk>.
If you <unk> them, you're <unk> to what's around them.
If they're <unk>, you know, you know, and they can <unk> a little bit.
If they're <unk>, you know, you know, and they can <unk> a little bit.
They also <unk> their movement and <unk>.
We've then realized that one of the interesting <unk> of the <unk> <unk> was that we could use common on data, for example, "<unk>" a <unk> color like it.
In this case, we have three <unk> <unk> as a <unk> <unk> and I can <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk>, where they <unk>.
and I can <unk> to <unk> the color in central, where you're <unk>.
We can <unk> too much, we can <unk> a little bit of place.
There are also <unk> possibilities to <unk>, like <unk>, <unk> and <unk> where people can try things quickly, and <unk> the results immediately, and <unk> the results immediately.
Now I'm --
This is a <unk> sequence that I do with a <unk> program.
Here we have a <unk> game of words that is half <unk> and <unk>.
<unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> a letter on every <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> to every <unk> <unk>, and as I was <unk> to <unk> words, he <unk> on a <unk>.
Then, after about 30 seconds, you get <unk>, and you have a new <unk> of <unk> and new possibilities to try.
Thank you.
Here's kids <unk> in <unk> <unk>, I did <unk> <unk>, I did so that I <unk> them and I <unk> them a video.
They're very <unk>.
And one of the interesting things about this <unk> is that you don't have to give people a lot of <unk>.
You just just say, "<unk> <unk>," and they know what to do.
Here we have other people who <unk> it.
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> there on the right.
It really wanted to <unk>.
It was just <unk>, for him.
Now, this is a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We could build a tool for the <unk> of the <unk>. He's <unk>.
It can <unk> new characters in the scene, <unk> their <unk>.
It can <unk> new characters in the scene, <unk> their <unk>.
So, that's the sun is <unk>.
<unk>: The sun is <unk>.
<unk>: Now, he brought a <unk> in the scene.
<unk>: The <unk> <unk>.
<unk>! Yeah!
So, we <unk> the <unk> and <unk> can <unk> the characters --
<unk>: <unk>!
<unk> your story.
<unk>: <unk>!
<unk>: It's a story with the open open, and can decide how to <unk> it.
<unk>: It's a story with the open open, and can decide how to <unk> it.
<unk>: <unk> away, <unk>.
<unk>: The last example I have time to show you is a <unk>, made of <unk>, to <unk> and <unk> music.
It's a <unk>, made of <unk>, to <unk> and <unk> music.
The <unk> here are <unk> by <unk> as basic, <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> of these have four different <unk>, and you can choose what to use.
You can also <unk> these <unk> in a sequence of <unk> to your <unk>.
And we just <unk> a <unk> sound and a <unk>.
These are the effects that you can control live, like <unk> and <unk>.
I'm going to <unk> it to a particular sound and then you can <unk> it.
And then there are the effects of as long and <unk>, <unk>, <unk> to the entire sequence.
<unk> like this.
<unk>: <unk>: <unk> <unk> a <unk> in two <unk>, "the <unk> in a series, the <unk>, the other basic <unk>.
Now let's take a <unk> line.
<unk>: <unk>: Now let's <unk> <unk> --
<unk>: <unk>: And now we're going to <unk> the <unk> to the <unk>, so I can control the effect of alive.
<unk>: <unk>: I can <unk> the entire <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> on one another.
<unk>: And now we're going to <unk> the <unk> to give more <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>: I can <unk> the <unk> <unk>.
So I don't have to <unk> before, but I can <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> or more <unk>.
And now, finally, I can <unk> the entire <unk> <unk> on the left the <unk> <unk>.
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is to build new <unk> <unk> <unk> to how our brain works and body.
And today, I've had time to show you one of the results of this <unk>, and some possibilities we try to bring out of the lab.
The concept I want to <unk> is that's <unk> this new generation of <unk> objects to <unk> media, that <unk> information in our world in the way we want.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the time to talk to all of you.
I'm a <unk>.
<unk> books is my <unk>, but it's more of this, of course.
It's also the love and the <unk> of my life.
And I don't think that it can change.
But, I said this, something particular happened in my life and in my career, who brought me to <unk> the whole relationship with this work.
The particular thing is I <unk> wrote this book, this <unk> called "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
And the result is that everywhere you are <unk> now, people <unk> me as if I was <unk>.
<unk> -- <unk>, <unk>!
I'm going to go to me and say, "You don't fear of being able to do better than you can do better than you can do better than you can.
You didn't fear to be able to write all of the life without having any longer to be able to create a book that can <unk> to somebody? "
<unk> that can <unk>? "
It's <unk>, you know.
But it could go worse, and I remember, over 20 years ago, when I started to say to people -- I was a <unk> -- I wanted to be a <unk>.
I'm going to <unk> the same <unk> <unk> by fear.
And people said, "Don't you know, you don't know to be successful?
You don't fear the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> you?
You don't fear of this <unk> <unk> all of life without anything to be <unk> out and die on a <unk> of <unk> <unk>? "
So you know, you know.
The short answer to all these questions is, "Yes."
Yeah, I fear of all those things.
I've been <unk>.
And I'm also afraid of many other things that people can't <unk>.
As the <unk> and other things <unk>.
But, as I was about the writing what I thought and I was, is why?
Is it <unk>?
It's <unk> that anybody who <unk> <unk> to be <unk> by a job that you feel <unk> to be <unk>.
But what's about so particular in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in a way that other <unk> <unk> don't do?
How did my father, for example, he was a <unk> <unk> and I didn't remember one time in his 40 years of <unk> in the <unk> when he was asked if she was <unk> to be <unk>?
It never got -- that <unk> of the <unk> John, how do you go?
<unk>'t you like this, <unk>?
<unk>, the engineers as a group of <unk>, in <unk>, <unk>, <unk> the <unk> of being <unk> <unk>.
We <unk>, we have enough this <unk>, and not only <unk> but <unk> of all of these <unk>, we have this <unk> to be <unk> <unk>.
And we don't know anything else that you look at the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that only in the <unk> century, <unk> young and often for them.
And even those who are not <unk> seem to be really <unk> by their <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, before he died in the last <unk> said, "My book <unk> me a little bit of a little bit more <unk> about the work of their lives.
But we didn't know when we were <unk> to say because we've heard these things so long that we have completely <unk> and <unk> the <unk> that creativity and <unk> is some <unk> <unk> and <unk> and art, at the end, we'll always get <unk>.
And the question I want to <unk> all over here today is: Are you agree with this idea?
It's OK, I'm going to give you this <unk> away from a <unk> distance to me not good for anything that <unk>.
I think it's <unk>.
And I think it's also <unk> and I don't want to <unk> in the next century.
I think it's better to <unk> our great <unk> <unk> to live.
And I know that, in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very <unk> to start <unk> to that <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> in which I'm <unk> in my career.
<unk> -- look, I'm pretty young, I'm <unk>, I'm <unk>.
I still have about four <unk> of work in me.
And it's very <unk> that anything <unk> in the world as the job that I'm going to be <unk> by the world as the job that I'm going to <unk> the <unk> of my last book.
<unk> <unk>, because we're all about <unk>, or less friends here -- is <unk> that my greatest success is to my <unk>.
Oh, <unk>, that thinking!
You know this is the kind of thought that leads a person to start <unk> at nine morning and I don't want to do it.
I'm going to keep this work that I love.
So, the question becomes, how?
And so I think, after many <unk>, that the way to work to be doing is to create a <unk> <unk>, OK?
I have to have a <unk> distance of <unk> between me, which I'm <unk>, and my natural <unk> to what <unk> <unk> <unk> and what wrote <unk> <unk>, and as we're going to look through the time, looking through, looking for other society to see if you could have some of better ideas and see if you could have some of better ideas and more <unk> ideas and <unk> ideas to see if you could have some of the best ideas and more <unk> ideas to do more <unk>.
about how to help people <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity.
And that research brought me to the <unk> <unk> and <unk>.
It's <unk> because you're going to <unk> and then <unk> back.
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> -- people don't believe that creativity <unk> from men, OK?
It was <unk> that creativity was this <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> to men somewhere somewhere <unk> and <unk>, for reasons and <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> these <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity.
<unk>, <unk>, <unk> to have a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> were the same idea, but we had that kind of <unk> of the spirit without a <unk>.
The <unk> is <unk>, because the <unk> didn't really understand that a <unk> was somebody particularly intelligent.
And I thought that a <unk> was this kind of <unk> <unk> that was literally <unk> in the <unk> of the study of a artist, a little bit of like the <unk> <unk>, and <unk> out of <unk> the <unk> of that work.
<unk> <unk> <unk>.
And everybody thought it was so that we were <unk>, right?
So, artists were <unk> by <unk> things, like, for example, the too <unk>, right?
If your work was <unk>, you didn't <unk> everything, you know that <unk> <unk> state of this <unk> <unk>.
If your work <unk>, it was not <unk> your <unk>, right?
Everybody <unk> that was your <unk> to be a <unk>.
And so people <unk> <unk> creativity in <unk> for a long time.
And then the <unk> <unk> and everything <unk>, and we <unk> this great idea; we put the human <unk> on the universe over the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and
This was the principle of <unk> <unk> and people started thinking about that creativity is <unk> completely from <unk>.
And for the first time in the story, <unk> to <unk> to this or that artist as a <unk> <unk> as a person with <unk>.
And I have to <unk>, I think it was a big <unk>.
I think you're going to somebody, a simple person to believe that they would be like a <unk>, like the source, the <unk> and the <unk> of all the <unk> <unk>, <unk> and <unk> and <unk> is a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's like to ask somebody to <unk> the sun.
<unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and creates all these <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk>.
And I think it was this pressure to <unk> artists in the <unk> 500 years.
And, if that is true, and I think it's true, the question, becomes, and now?
Can we do it?
We can go back to a <unk> understanding of the relationship between humans and <unk> <unk>.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we can't <unk> 500 years of thinking in a <unk> talk of 18 minutes.
And there are probably people in the audience who <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of <unk>, <unk>, you know that you <unk> people <unk> to their projects.
You probably don't <unk> you all know about this.
But the question I'd like to ask you is -- why not?
Why don't we <unk> this way?
Because it makes more sense of anything that I've ever heard to explain the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> process.
A process that, as anyone who ever <unk> to do something -- so, basically, everybody here -- knows, you know, you don't <unk> <unk>.
And in fact, it can be completely <unk>.
I did this <unk> <unk> with the extraordinary <unk> <unk>, who has now 90 years now, but it was a <unk> for life and said that during his <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk>, <unk> out of the <unk> <unk>, <unk> out of the <unk>, and <unk>, in the <unk> <unk>.
He told me he was like a <unk> <unk>.
And he <unk> <unk> to her from the <unk>.
We could get it, because he was <unk> the <unk> under his feet.
We were <unk> to have one thing to do to do that point and was in, words, "<unk> as a <unk>."
And so he went back to the house and he was <unk> by this <unk>, and he didn't have to get anything else that's a piece of paper and a <unk> <unk> and <unk> on the page.
We were not going to be <unk> enough, so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> without being able to get home to <unk> and <unk> the <unk> through and she would <unk> through the <unk>, to, as she said, "another <unk>."
And then there were those times -- this piece of <unk> never -- there were some moments when he was almost <unk>, OK?
So, he was <unk> home and he was looking for the <unk> and <unk> through, and he <unk> the <unk> through, and he was <unk>, and he was <unk>, and he was <unk> with the other hand and <unk>.
<unk> the <unk> from the tail and the <unk> in his body and the <unk> on the page.
And in these cases, the <unk> would be <unk> on the <unk> page and <unk>, but on the last word for the first.
So when you <unk> it -- it's <unk>, it's exactly <unk> to my <unk> process.
Not all my <unk> process -- I'm not a <unk>!
I'm a <unk>, and my way of <unk> is; I'm going to <unk> at the same <unk> every day and <unk> and work and <unk> on and <unk> on top.
But even I, in my <unk>, I <unk> against that thing, sometimes.
And I'm also <unk> a lot of you <unk> it.
You know, even if the job of the ideas, I'm going to <unk> from a source I couldn't <unk> <unk>.
And what is this thing?
And how can we <unk> it so we don't lose your head, but rather, what do you <unk> <unk>?
As I'm about, the best example I have is the <unk> <unk> <unk>, which I've been <unk> several years ago for a <unk>.
<unk> talking about this, and you know, <unk>, for the <unk> of life was the <unk> of the artist <unk> <unk>, <unk>, trying to control, <unk>, <unk> these <unk> species of <unk> <unk>.
But then he was <unk>, and one day while he was <unk> on a <unk> <unk> <unk>, he was <unk> on a <unk> <unk>, he was <unk> all for him.
<unk> <unk>, all of a <unk> <unk> this little <unk> of <unk>, that comes into his head as the <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, and the wants, you know, it's wonderful, and the <unk>, but it doesn't know how to <unk>.
It doesn't have a piece of paper, it's not a <unk>, it's not a <unk>.
So, you start to feel this kind of old <unk> <unk> in him, "I'm going to lose, and <unk> <unk> on this <unk> song.
I'm not <unk> enough and I can't <unk> it. "
And instead of going to go to the <unk>, they <unk>.
He <unk> the whole process and made something completely new.
He just <unk> the sky and said, "<unk>, you can't see that I'm <unk>?"
"You know, do you have to write a song now?
If you really want to <unk>, you'll <unk> it in a <unk> moment when I can take care of you.
<unk>, we're going to <unk> <unk> more today.
We're going to <unk> <unk> <unk>. "
And his process <unk> <unk> after this.
Not the job, it was still <unk> as always.
But the process, and the <unk> <unk> that <unk> was <unk> when he <unk> the <unk>, the <unk> that outside him, the <unk> that outside, <unk>, <unk> that it was <unk> that it didn't have to be something <unk> and <unk>.
but it was <unk> this <unk>, <unk> <unk> a conversation between <unk> and this <unk> thing that but it wasn't <unk>.
So, as I <unk> that story to change a little bit of the way I'm going to <unk> you once and I was.
This idea, I was <unk> when I was <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and I <unk> in one of the <unk> where we're <unk> when we're working on something and we're not going to do it, and you're going to think it's going to be a <unk>, that what will be the <unk> book.
Not only <unk>, just the book wrote.
And we start thinking about <unk> this project.
But then I <unk> to <unk> that <unk> up and <unk> us.
So I <unk> my face on the <unk> and <unk> my <unk> to a <unk> <unk> of the room.
And I said high <unk>, "<unk>, what, we know that if this book is not going to be <unk>, not going to be <unk>, not?
Because as you see, I'm <unk> everything I've been, I don't have this.
So if you want it to be better, you have to do your <unk>.
OK. But if you don't do it, you know what, you don't know anything.
I started writing the same because it's my job.
And I would like to be <unk> that I'm <unk> to do my part of "Because -- at the end is like this, OK -- <unk>, <unk> does in the <unk> of the <unk>, the <unk> of the moon, <unk> and <unk> music that would <unk> on for hours to <unk>.
And they were always <unk>, because the <unk> were <unk> and they were <unk>.
But every <unk>, <unk>, something <unk>, and one of these <unk> artists actually <unk>.
And I know what I'm talking about, because I know I know that you all saw, at some point, a <unk> like this.
It was as if time <unk>, and the <unk> <unk> through a kind of <unk> and it wasn't doing anything different from usually, like the <unk> <unk>, but everything.
And suddenly we don't just <unk> as a human.
But it <unk> out of the <unk> and <unk> in the fire of the <unk>.
And when this <unk>, people <unk> what was, he <unk> him with his name.
<unk> your hands and <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, God," God, "
That's God, you know.
<unk> <unk> -- when the <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the <unk>, you'll <unk> this <unk> with them and <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> by "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, which you can still hear in <unk> or in <unk>.
In <unk>, when an artist has done something impossible and <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>," <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>," <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, "" <unk>,
And it's <unk> because we need it.
But, the problem comes up the next day, when you <unk> and <unk> that are the 11 <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> God's not there.
It's just a <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk>, and maybe never <unk> to <unk> that <unk>.
And maybe nobody <unk> the name of God still as she <unk>, and what does do with the rest of his life?
It's hard.
This is one of the <unk> <unk> to do in a <unk> life.
But maybe it doesn't have to be so <unk> if you can't believe, you know, <unk> the most <unk> of your being being.
But let's just <unk> that you have data in the <unk> of this <unk> part of your life that you have to go to <unk> on other when you're finished.
And, you know, if we think it's all change.
And so I started <unk>, and it's like I <unk> it for several months during the <unk> of the book that I was going to <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>,
And what I have to continue to <unk> when I feel this is, I'm not afraid.
Don't <unk>. You just <unk> your job.
<unk> to <unk>, any <unk> can be.
If you work is <unk>, <unk>.
If the <unk>, you would <unk> to you <unk> some kind of <unk>, <unk> <unk> some kind of <unk>, for one moment through your <unk>, then you know! "
You know, you're doing the same your <unk>.
And <unk>! "<unk>!" You're going to do that same.
I think we and I think it's <unk> <unk>.
"<unk>!" <unk>! "<unk>" <unk> "<unk>" <unk> "
Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk>: <unk>!
As you know, I've been talking about some of these projects on the human genome, what can <unk> and <unk> of new genes.
We're <unk> a new <unk>, we started to <unk> biology and now starting from that digital code we're <unk> into a new <unk> of biology, <unk> and <unk> and <unk> life.
We've been trying to <unk> big questions.
"What is life?" It's something that many <unk> I think have <unk> to understand how many levels.
We tried different <unk>, <unk> to <unk> terms.
We're <unk> for about 20 years now.
When we <unk> the human genome <unk> to go from the <unk> world of biology in the digital world.
Now, do we're going to <unk> life, or create new life from this digital universe?
This is the map of a little <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, which is the <unk> species from the <unk> genome between those that can <unk> into the lab that can <unk> in the lab.
And we tried to reduce the genome to <unk> one even smaller.
We're able to <unk> a <unk> of about 500 that are here.
But when we take a look at his <unk> map, it's simple than our.
<unk>, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can <unk>, one at a time, it's very <unk> that this can bring a <unk> cell.
So we thought the only way to <unk> was <unk> this <unk> to <unk> the <unk> to <unk> some of these questions.
And so we started the <unk> of the <unk>, we can <unk> a <unk>?
Can the chemistry <unk> of these great molecules that we never could never do before we could do before we could do before?
And in case we can <unk> it, can make a <unk>?
A <unk> is just a piece of <unk> material.
The speed with which we're able to <unk> life is <unk> to <unk> <unk>.
Our <unk> capacity to write the code, instead, <unk> slowly, but it's <unk>.
And our <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We've <unk> over 15 years ago.
The process has <unk> a lot of <unk>, <unk> with a <unk> <unk> before we <unk> the early experiments.
But we found that we <unk> of DNA is very hard.
There are <unk> of thousands of cars in the world that we can see little <unk> of DNA <unk>, <unk> <unk>, and it's a <unk> process. It's more <unk>, the <unk> is long, there are.
So we had to develop a new <unk> to <unk> these <unk> and <unk>.
And this was our first <unk>, starting digital information of the genome of the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's a little <unk> that bacteria <unk>.
We designed the <unk>, we <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> a <unk> of DNA about <unk> <unk>.
The interesting part is when we took this piece of <unk> material <unk> and we <unk> it into the bacteria, the bacteria have <unk> to read this code and <unk> particles.
<unk> particles have been <unk> by cells, are <unk> back and they <unk> the <unk> <unk>.
I've been talking about the <unk> <unk> industry that they certainly <unk> this model.
They have more of you.
And we think this is a situation where the software can actually build his <unk> in a <unk> system.
But we could do things in a big.
We had to build the whole <unk> of <unk>.
I'm more than <unk> <unk> <unk>.
So we thought we were <unk> in the <unk> of the virus, so that we can change the <unk> to understand what the <unk> of a <unk> cell.
<unk> is <unk>, and if you could <unk> information in a computer, they must be very <unk>.
When we <unk> this genome for the first time in <unk>, the standard <unk> was a <unk> for every 10 <unk> <unk>.
We found, <unk>, 30 <unk>. If we were using that original <unk> <unk> never been able to do it work.
One part of the process is design <unk> 50 <unk> that <unk> with all the other <unk> of 50 <unk> to build smaller <unk> than <unk> together.
And you see elements that's <unk> here.
You probably read that <unk> us from the <unk>.
<unk> <unk>: We have a <unk> code on four <unk> <unk>: A, <unk>, <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> of those <unk> <unk> together, about 20 <unk>, and there's a <unk> order to <unk> every <unk>.
So we can use the code for writing words, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
What we did at beginning was <unk>.
Some of them were <unk> by the fact that it wasn't <unk>.
We designed these <unk> <unk> to <unk> just <unk> with <unk>.
There are <unk> that we <unk> them and <unk> them.
And we started to <unk> <unk> parts, <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We've made these <unk> <unk> in <unk> so that we're <unk> to <unk>, because we're <unk> to create a <unk> <unk> as you'll see in a minute.
We're trying to <unk> the process.
So, this looks like the <unk> of a <unk> <unk>.
When we started these <unk> <unk> <unk>, over 100 <unk> <unk>, you don't get <unk> to <unk> <unk>.
It's <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
So we've <unk> other <unk>.
We're going to talk about another <unk> called <unk> <unk>, which in biology <unk> to <unk> the <unk>.
Here's an example.
This <unk>, called <unk> <unk>, can <unk> three million <unk> <unk>.
You can see in the <unk> <unk> as his <unk> is <unk>.
In 12 -- it's <unk> <unk> exactly as before.
<unk> of thousands of organisms that are able to do this.
These organisms can <unk> completely <unk>.
We had to live under <unk>.
I'm absolutely sure that life <unk> in space, and you're <unk> to find new <unk> <unk>.
In fact, NASA showed that this happens.
This is a picture of the <unk> that we built using these <unk>, just by using the <unk> with the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> them <unk>.
This image wasn't <unk> with a <unk> <unk>, but with a <unk> <unk>.
It's such a <unk> <unk> that we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk>.
These are pictures that <unk> a period of about six seconds.
This is the <unk> we've done little time ago.
I'm more than <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's the largest <unk> of a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's got a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
If you <unk> it with a <unk> 10 <unk>, and we just <unk> pages to <unk> this <unk> code.
Now, how do we make it work? How can we <unk>?
<unk>, of course, is a game of kids.
It's a little bit more <unk> when you use bacteria.
It's easier when it's <unk> cells like our <unk>. You can just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> another, which is basically the process of <unk>.
In <unk>, we <unk> the <unk> is instead <unk> in the cell, but we <unk> <unk> that we're able to do a <unk> <unk> of a <unk> <unk> from a <unk> cell to another and <unk>.
We <unk> a <unk> <unk> from a species.
The two are the <unk> of the men from the <unk>.
We have <unk> some <unk> in a <unk> way that we could decide what to do for this <unk>.
And then he <unk> it with the <unk> so that we could <unk> all the <unk>.
And when we put it in the cell was <unk> and <unk> our <unk> <unk> the new <unk> went into the cell.
And we <unk> <unk> that we didn't go beyond, but we tried to <unk> it in <unk>.
This is one of the major <unk> of evolution.
We found that <unk> species have <unk> a second or a third <unk> somewhere, <unk> in a second thousands of new <unk> to that species.
So those who think about the evolution as a <unk> that <unk> has not <unk> <unk> of biology.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that DNA <unk>.
The <unk> that was in the cell, we didn't get one.
The <unk> <unk> we <unk> it.
It's <unk>, and it <unk> the other <unk> like <unk>, and we just <unk> with the cell and the new <unk>.
It's become blue because of the genes we've <unk>.
And in a short <unk> of time, all of the <unk> of a species are <unk> go <unk>, and it <unk> of all in a new species, <unk> on the new software that we <unk> in the cell.
All the <unk> are <unk>, the <unk> are <unk>, and when you <unk> the <unk> code exactly what we've <unk> you.
Now, this may seem <unk> <unk>, but we can change the software things that we can change things in a pretty <unk> way.
Now, I've already <unk> that there is not talking about <unk> -- but of progress from three million years and a half million years of evolution, and I said that maybe we're going to create a new version of <unk> <unk> in which we <unk> new species <unk> on this digital process.
Why do that?
I think it's pretty <unk> when we think of our <unk>.
We're going to go from six and a half billion people in the next 40 years.
Just to give an example, I was born in <unk>.
Now there are three people on the planet to <unk> in the <unk>; in 40 years, there will be four years.
We're <unk> problems now to find food, water and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> for six billion and a half of people.
We're going to have to do it for nine billion.
<unk> more than five billion <unk>, over 30 billion <unk> <unk>.
That means 100 million <unk> a day.
When we try to find <unk> <unk>, or any kind of process to <unk>, it will be a huge challenge.
We have to <unk> the whole <unk> of CO2 from these materials that we <unk> in the atmosphere.
And so, by the way, with the <unk> <unk> around the world, we have a <unk> with about 20 million genes, and I like to think that are the <unk> <unk> for the future.
The <unk> industry only a <unk> about <unk>, and think about how many different things are <unk> out.
Our <unk> here are <unk> data from the reality of the <unk> and our imagination.
We now have <unk>, with these <unk> <unk> <unk>, to be able to create what we call <unk> <unk>.
We're able to build a big robot that can produce a million <unk> a day.
Think about <unk> these 20 million different genes or <unk> to try to <unk> the <unk> to make <unk> or <unk>, new <unk>, we can change, with a little <unk>, and create more <unk> biology that we're in the last 20 years of science.
And it's just a standard <unk>.
We can choose to <unk>, chemistry and <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
This is a <unk> of some <unk> software that we're working on to be able to <unk> and design species on the computer.
Well, we don't know how to be.
We know exactly what their <unk> code is.
We're going to <unk> on the <unk> generation.
You also saw you who <unk> <unk> from the <unk> was a <unk> experiment.
We've <unk> <unk> and third generation that we're <unk> enough to <unk> <unk> as <unk> or different kinds of <unk>.
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without <unk> the cost of the food and <unk> would be <unk> CO2 in matter before, so we're working on to design cells that can achieve this purpose, and we think we can get the first <unk> <unk> in about 18 months.
<unk> light <unk> with CO2 is a <unk>, but in our <unk> <unk>, we found different <unk>.
This is a <unk> that we <unk> in <unk>.
<unk> in the deep ocean, at about <unk> feet of water at the temperature of water.
It's <unk> <unk> by CO2 using <unk> as a source of energy.
We're trying to understand if we can <unk> CO2, that can easily be <unk> by <unk>, <unk> that can easily be <unk> by <unk>, to drive this process.
So, we think that we could be able to <unk> what the basic question is that what life is life. "We, we <unk>, we <unk> the <unk> goal of <unk> the whole industry.
<unk>. If you can't do it from TED, where can you do?
We're going to have a <unk> source of energy.
And also, we're working on the same <unk> to create <unk> <unk>.
You saw this year with flu, we've been <unk> and with a dollar in less when it's about finding the right <unk>.
I think that you can change by <unk> <unk>.
Here's how the future may begin to look <unk>, now, the tree of evolution, <unk> the tree, <unk> the evolution with bacteria, <unk>, and then <unk> cells.
We're so <unk> to <unk> people.
Our goal is to do <unk> in a way of living enough to try to <unk>. Thank you very much.
I'm going to show you, the <unk> <unk> possible, some fundamental work, some <unk>, of the new technology that we brought to <unk> <unk> to a <unk> almost a year ago. This is <unk>.
It's a environment where you can <unk> is <unk> with a huge amount of <unk> data.
We're seeing <unk> <unk> pictures of <unk> with a kind of <unk> and <unk>, for a <unk> <unk>, <unk> the images like we want.
And it doesn't matter how big the amount of information that we see, how big these <unk> of data <unk> or images.
Most of them are common photographs, but this is a <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, and <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's not a difference because the only thing that <unk> the <unk> of a system like this is the number of <unk> on your screen at any moment. It's also a very <unk> architecture.
This is a whole book, example of data not images.
This is the <unk> <unk> <unk>. Every <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk>.
And to <unk> that it's really about the text and we can do something like this, to actually see that it's a real <unk> <unk>, not a picture.
It could be a little <unk> way to read a book.
I'm not going to <unk> it.
This is a more <unk> example. It's a <unk> number of <unk>.
Every great image is the beginning of a <unk>.
And it really gives you the <unk> and the beautiful experience of the <unk> version of a <unk> or a <unk>, which is for nature a <unk> kind of a <unk>, which is for nature a <unk> kind of a <unk>.
We also did something with the corner of this particular number of the <unk>.
We've created a <unk> <unk> much <unk> than what you use in a normal <unk> and we've <unk> you to <unk> the <unk>.
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk>, you can see it here.
Or some <unk>, or even the <unk> <unk>.
And this really <unk> some of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of space on the screen.
We thought this this <unk> <unk> to <unk> and other <unk> <unk>, not to be <unk>.
Of course, the <unk> is one of the most <unk> <unk> for this kind of technology.
And I don't want to lose time, if not to say we have <unk> to give this <unk>.
These are all the streets in the United States <unk> over a <unk> image of NASA <unk>.
So now we're going to do something else.
This is actually live on the Web; you can see it.
It's a project called <unk>, which <unk> two different technologies.
One is <unk> and the other is a <unk> <unk> computer computer, very interesting <unk> that they made by <unk> <unk>, a student of the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And it's alive on the Web, <unk> <unk>.
You can <unk> when we do this kind of <unk>, where we can go from a picture to another and have this kind of experience to <unk>.
But the <unk> <unk> of the images here actually actually have a meaning.
The <unk> of the <unk> of the computer have <unk> these pictures together, so that we can <unk> to <unk> places that are all <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> have been <unk>. Here you see some <unk> of a <unk> or <unk>, and these things have all been <unk>.
I don't know if I have time to show you some other environment.
There are much more <unk>.
I want to go directly to one of the <unk> of the <unk> data and this <unk> from a <unk> <unk> of <unk> that we've done for the first time, I'm going to show you what <unk> is really the key behind this technology, the <unk> technology, and it's not as much <unk> by looking at the <unk> that we've done in the website.
We had to <unk> some <unk> and so on.
This is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> of <unk> and <unk> pictures of <unk> and <unk> of <unk> and <unk> pictures of <unk> and so on. And so on. <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> a picture that has <unk> to this model.
So, they're all <unk> <unk> and have been all <unk> <unk> in this way.
And it's possible to <unk> this <unk> way.
You know, I never thought of, to end up.
It's very <unk> to <unk> this kind of <unk> here.
I think you can see that it's a lot of different kinds of <unk>: from those <unk> to <unk> <unk>, a number, <unk>, <unk> number, <unk> together in this environment.
And if I can, I can <unk> and <unk> those <unk>.
A lot of people are <unk> <unk>, etc.
<unk>, you know, somewhere here is a series of photographs -- <unk>.
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We can go from the <unk> to the physics of this environment.
The <unk> point is that we can do things with social environment. This is <unk> data from <unk> memory of how to <unk> the earth, from the <unk> point of view and <unk> and <unk> all that data together.
All of those pictures become <unk> together, more than the <unk>.
You have a model of the entire <unk> that you <unk>.
Think about this as the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> on Earth.
It's something that we <unk> in complexity as people <unk>, and the <unk> that you <unk> the <unk> with the use.
They have pictures of <unk> with <unk> <unk> from other people.
If somebody comes to <unk> all these <unk> <unk> <unk>, the name, my <unk> picture of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> all of that data, and I can use it as a <unk> <unk> to <unk> in that space, in that <unk>, using the pictures of anyone else, and have a social experience kind of <unk> and <unk>.
Of course, a <unk> of all of this is <unk> <unk> of every interesting part of the earth, <unk> not only by <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk>.
Thank you very much.
CA: I realized? What do you have to understand? What your software <unk> us to do is that at some point, in the next few years, all the <unk> <unk> to anyone in the world's world <unk> together?
<unk>: Yeah. What's's actually doing is <unk>.
It's creating <unk>, if you want, between pictures.
And it's doing it in the content of images.
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the <unk> of information that a lot of these <unk> images.
As you do a <unk> of images on the Web, you <unk> a <unk> and the <unk> on the page has a lot of information about images.
Now, what if that picture <unk> all of your picture?
So the amount of <unk> <unk> and the amount of <unk> <unk> that <unk> is really enormous. It's a <unk> effect.
CA: <unk>, it's really <unk>. <unk>.
<unk>: I'm going to <unk> you very much.
One of the major <unk> when you <unk> and one of the <unk> research is the to live in the <unk>, who didn't <unk> the <unk> <unk>, including the <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk>, <unk> it in the <unk> <unk> of plants.
You might think that <unk> <unk> <unk> still beyond the <unk> <unk>, or that the <unk> <unk> are still <unk> <unk> of <unk>, or that in <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> still the <unk> of <unk>, to <unk> the <unk>, to <unk> the <unk>, and that the idea that the world in which we live in a sense, but it's only a model of the world in which we don't exist in a sense, but it is actually a model.
the <unk> of a particular particular <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> that our <unk> did, or bad, a lot of <unk>.
And, of course, all of the <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>.
We're <unk> to <unk> <unk>.
We have to deal with the <unk> of death, so we don't <unk> us if we could <unk> and <unk> --
We all have a art.
What's the particular <unk> of the song, the <unk> of the <unk> of every culture.
It doesn't matter that they're the <unk> of the <unk>, or the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, or the <unk> <unk> <unk>, or the <unk> of <unk>, or a <unk> in the <unk> of <unk>.
He was my <unk> of a journey in the <unk> <unk> a month ago, or a <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk> mother of the world.
All of these <unk> <unk> that there are other ways of <unk> other ways of thinking, other ways of to think, other ways of moving in the world.
And if you just take a second, it's a concept that can give you hope.
<unk>, the <unk> of the world create a <unk> of <unk> life and <unk> the planet and it's important to the <unk> of the planet as the <unk> <unk> as the <unk> <unk> as <unk>.
And you can think of this <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and you can <unk> the <unk> of all the <unk>, the <unk> of all the <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> in being by human imagination from <unk>.
The <unk> is the fantastic <unk> of humanity.
It's the <unk> of what we are and what we can be as <unk> species.
And <unk> the <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, for example, <unk> that 50 percent of all species is or is on the <unk> of the <unk>, because it's <unk>, or -- in the <unk> of <unk> diversity -- and you don't even <unk> <unk> -- that diversity.
The <unk> of that is, of course, the <unk> <unk>.
When you're <unk> <unk> <unk> on this planet.
A language is not only <unk> by a <unk> or from a series of rules of <unk>.
A language is the <unk> of the <unk>.
It's the middle with which the <unk> of every culture comes in the material.
Every language is a forest of the mind, a <unk>, a <unk> of <unk>.
And of those <unk> <unk>, while we're sitting here in <unk>, at least half is no <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of children.
They don't get to kids, which means, unless you <unk> something, which are <unk>.
What's more <unk> than the <unk>, the last to be <unk>, to be the last to talk about a language, to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> or <unk> the kids?
This <unk> <unk> was a few weeks, and some of the world every two weeks, every two weeks, every two weeks, and it <unk> with it in the <unk> <unk> of a <unk> language.
And I know that somebody of you say, "Don't that way?
The world would not be a better place if we could all <unk> in the same language? "<unk>, then we're talking to all <unk>.
<unk> <unk>.
We're <unk> with a <unk> thing to say not to <unk> your language.
I'd like to give you a journey through the <unk> --
a little journey in the <unk> to give you a <unk> of what we're <unk>.
A lot of us <unk> that when I say, "different ways of <unk>," I mean, "I really different ways of <unk>.
So, for example, this <unk> <unk>, in <unk> <unk>, the <unk> of the <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
It's a <unk> that's not able to <unk> the blue color from the green green because the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> time of the forest, where the <unk> is <unk>.
They have a <unk> language and a <unk> rule, <unk> <unk>, "<unk>": you have to <unk> a person talking different language.
And all of this <unk> <unk>, yet the <unk> is that in these <unk> families where you're talking about six or seven <unk> <unk> because of the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's going to listen and then you start talking about.
And I <unk> one of the most interesting <unk> that I lived with, the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, an incredible <unk> that had the first <unk> in <unk>.
In <unk>, five <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk>.
They did <unk> by photographs that <unk> them in the <unk> that <unk> <unk>, <unk> that this <unk> <unk> of the <unk> forest <unk> had never seen anything <unk>.
They <unk> the pictures of land, they <unk> them to <unk> a form or a <unk> and, not <unk> anything, they <unk> that they <unk> <unk>, and they <unk> the five <unk> with <unk>.
But the <unk> didn't just <unk> the <unk>.
It's <unk> between them.
<unk> percent of the <unk> was <unk> by their own.
We're <unk> at eight <unk> and we found two <unk> of natural death and when we <unk> to know, they <unk> that one of them was <unk> so that he's dead <unk>, and then <unk> the same. [<unk>]].
The <unk> were able to recognize the animal <unk> from 40 <unk> and to <unk> the species.
In the early '<unk>, it was <unk> a very interesting task when my <unk> <unk>, I was <unk> if I could go to <unk> <unk> with the <unk> society at the base of the <unk> <unk> and <unk>, and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and
For a sense of <unk>, I should have understand the <unk> culture and that the <unk> isn't <unk> <unk>.
It's quite a <unk> <unk> vision of the world.
Very interesting.
If you <unk> to <unk> the world's great <unk>, what would you <unk> me?
<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, etc.
A continent comes out, thinking that Africa doesn't have <unk> <unk>. And instead, <unk>, and the <unk> is not anything else that the <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
What makes interesting is the <unk> <unk> of life and death.
So the <unk> are <unk> <unk>.
<unk> can be <unk> by the <unk> <unk>, <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the alive in a <unk> way that for a short second becomes the <unk>.
So, for this <unk> <unk> to say, "<unk> go to <unk> to talk about God.
We <unk> in <unk> and <unk> God. "
And since you're <unk>, is the spirit that you're <unk>, as you can get <unk> <unk>?
So you're going to these incredible events: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a rather <unk> of the power of the mind when it's <unk> in a state of <unk> <unk>.
And so, all the <unk> that I lived the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, in the <unk> <unk>.
<unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that once <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
In a <unk> continent of blood, this <unk> never been <unk> by <unk>.
In <unk>, I'm <unk> by a <unk>, but their <unk> is <unk>.
The young <unk> are <unk> <unk> away from <unk> to <unk> and <unk>, and live in a world <unk> and <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> for 18 years.
Two <unk> of nine years <unk> by the way to <unk> the nine months of <unk> that <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>.
For all of this time, they're <unk> to <unk> their society, values that <unk> their <unk> and only their <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or to say <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And so, in this incredible <unk>, they're <unk> <unk> and for the first time in their life, they see a <unk>. And in that moment of <unk> first, when the sun <unk> <unk>, everything they've learned in the <unk> <unk>, everything they've learned in the <unk>. The <unk> <unk> <unk>, everything they've learned in all <unk>. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. And the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
"<unk>? I'm going to tell you.
It's <unk>. Now it's going to be <unk>. "
They're <unk> <unk> and say we, <unk> <unk>, we are the <unk> of the world's <unk>.
This <unk> level is extremely important.
When we think of <unk> <unk> and the <unk> environment and the old story of the <unk> <unk>, which is a <unk> in his <unk> or maybe <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and maybe <unk> and we say that these are <unk> <unk> to the Earth than we.
The <unk> <unk> are not <unk> or <unk> <unk>.
There's no space for these things in the <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk>, but because of time and <unk>, have created a <unk> of the Earth <unk> <unk> <unk>, not on the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, but a <unk> <unk>, the concept that the Earth can live only in because it's <unk> by human <unk>.
What does that mean?
I mean that a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> that the mountain is a <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> that the mountain is going to be <unk> different and will have a <unk> <unk> different and will have a <unk> <unk> <unk> that a mountain or the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> is a <unk> of a spirit or a <unk> <unk> is <unk>.
What's interesting is the <unk> that <unk> the relationship between the <unk> and the natural world.
I grew up in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that the <unk> to be <unk>.
And that made me a human being different from my friends who believe that <unk> are the <unk> <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, live in the <unk> <unk>, <unk> that <unk> during the <unk> <unk>.
If we start to <unk> that these <unk> can actually create <unk>, we could actually start to understand some of their <unk> <unk>.
I've <unk> this picture in <unk> in the <unk> <unk>.
Maybe some of you have heard about the <unk>, the most powerful <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk>.
What makes the <unk> is not the potential of <unk>, but its <unk>. It's <unk> by two elements.
On the one hand, this <unk> <unk> <unk> that has a series of <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
And the only <unk> you have a <unk> <unk> that <unk> a little <unk>, but it's <unk> with the <unk> of a <unk> family <unk> said <unk>.
This <unk> has <unk> <unk>, very similar to the <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
If you're going to see the <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> the <unk> that are doing from a different <unk> of species, <unk> it has <unk> <unk>.
<unk> that <unk> on the <unk> is a little bit of like being <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a sea of electricity. It doesn't create a <unk> of reality.
I often was with my <unk>, Richard <unk> <unk>, the man who <unk> the <unk> was <unk>, with his discovery of the <unk> <unk> in the '<unk>.
My <unk> is not <unk> these <unk> as a <unk> that you can't tell anybody to be <unk>. And you can't tell anybody to be <unk>. And they can't be <unk> because they're <unk> by a <unk> that's <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
It's possible to <unk> only if we could <unk> with other <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk>.
Now it's the <unk>: the <unk> that are in this <unk> are <unk> of the same kind of necessary to <unk> the <unk>. The question is, in a <unk> of <unk> species of plants, how these <unk> <unk>, how these <unk> <unk> <unk>. <unk> question: In a <unk>, create a <unk> version of the <unk>.
We use the great <unk> of <unk> and <unk>, that can <unk> <unk>.
But if you go to the <unk>, we'll get the plants. "
What does that mean?
This <unk>, the <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> in the forest, and that our eyes will be in the same species.
If you <unk> them like they <unk> their <unk> <unk> us, "<unk> <unk> of plants, and you don't know everything?" I said, "No."
The solution is: you take the <unk> <unk> in a night of moon and <unk> <unk> with a different <unk>.
And so we don't <unk> to <unk>, but it's much more interesting than <unk> <unk>.
Now, [<unk>] the problem is that even those of us who have heart <unk> <unk> them, but somehow <unk> to the <unk> of the story of the <unk> of the world as as well as.
In fact, the <unk> century, in 300 years, not <unk> <unk> for its <unk> or its <unk> <unk>, but rather as the was in which we <unk> and we <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> the mass of diversity and <unk> and <unk> of the planet. Now the problem is not the change.
All the <unk> through the <unk> have been <unk> in a <unk> for new possibilities of life.
And the problem is not technology.
<unk> <unk> have no <unk> to be <unk> when they have <unk> <unk> and <unk> as well as the <unk> <unk> have not <unk> to be <unk> when they've <unk> <unk> and <unk>.
It's not the change or technology that <unk> the <unk> of <unk>. It's the power.
The <unk> <unk> of <unk>.
And if you look at the world, you'll see that these are not <unk> <unk> to <unk>.
They are <unk> creatures and <unk> <unk> out of the existence of the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk>.
<unk> <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> --
a <unk> <unk> <unk>, in the <unk> <unk>, a <unk> that has been <unk> <unk> in the forest until a generation ago, and now <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk>, where you can see the <unk> <unk> <unk>, where you can see the <unk> <unk> <unk>, where you can see the <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk>,
We started <unk> with the <unk> <unk> with the forest.
Or, in case of <unk>, are the diseases that are <unk> with the <unk> discovery of the <unk>.
If you put on the <unk> of the <unk>, where I'm doing a lot of research, you'll see the <unk> <unk> of politics.
As a <unk>, the <unk> physics of a <unk>, is <unk> at the <unk> level, but the <unk>, the <unk> of a <unk>, not only is it's <unk>, but <unk> <unk> in certain <unk>, because it's part of the <unk> of development.
And you can't understand the <unk> of the <unk> until you go from the beginning.
I've been <unk> <unk> miles from <unk> in the Western China through the <unk> <unk>, <unk> to <unk> with a young <unk>, but only <unk> I realized what's behind the <unk> that I'd talk about.
<unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> million people <unk> from the <unk> during the <unk> <unk>.
The father of this guy was <unk> to the <unk> <unk>.
which means that it was <unk> to the Chinese days of the <unk>.
<unk> <unk> is <unk> with <unk> <unk> during the <unk> that brought the <unk> in <unk>.
My mother was <unk> and his <unk> was <unk>.
It was taken to <unk> in <unk> at age of two years, under his <unk> his <unk> because he couldn't have to live without him.
The <unk>, who did the same, was <unk> in the field of <unk>.
One day, he <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> and, for this <unk>, was <unk> to <unk> <unk> for seven years.
The <unk> <unk> can be <unk>, but the spirit of the <unk> <unk> is <unk> by <unk> present.
And then, all of the way you're <unk> to a choice.
<unk> we live in the world of <unk> or we want to <unk> the world of diversity?
The great <unk> <unk> <unk>, before he died, he said that his greatest fear was that, in our <unk> <unk> <unk>, not only <unk> the whole <unk> of the <unk> of the world, not only to <unk> the entire human imagination <unk> to a <unk> <unk> that were other possibilities.
And it's <unk> to <unk> that our species is <unk> for <unk> years.
The <unk> <unk>, that has given us agriculture, that he made us <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk>, <unk> the <unk> of the <unk>, creating the <unk> of <unk>, creating the <unk> of <unk>, and we talk about <unk> years ago.
The <unk> world has <unk> 300 years old.
And that <unk> story is not <unk> me that we have the answers to all the challenges that we could <unk> in the <unk> to come.
When we're <unk> to the world's <unk> what it means to be human, we're <unk> with <unk> <unk>.
And it's in these answers that we all <unk> the possibility of being what we are, a <unk> species, that must <unk> all <unk> can <unk>. And there are great moments of <unk>.
I <unk> this picture of the <unk> <unk>, when I went to <unk> with <unk> <unk>, and this man, <unk>, <unk> me the wonderful story of his <unk>.
The <unk> government was not always <unk> with the <unk> <unk> and in the '<unk> to <unk> our <unk>, we <unk> them into <unk>.
The <unk> of this man <unk> <unk>.
The family, <unk> for her life, <unk> <unk> all the <unk>, and all his <unk>.
You know, you know, you don't know the cold, you know.
The <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> fish were made of <unk> fish in <unk>.
The <unk> of this man didn't <unk> from night or <unk> <unk> or <unk>.
It's <unk> away, it's <unk> the <unk> <unk> in your hand. When I did it <unk>, he <unk> it by creating a <unk>.
It's got <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk> <unk> and when <unk> <unk>, he <unk> a dog.
It <unk> the dog and created a <unk>, with the <unk> <unk> created a <unk>, has <unk> another dog and it's <unk> on the <unk>, <unk> <unk> in <unk>.
<unk> to talk about <unk> with anything? [<unk>] And this, in different ways, [<unk>] is the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and all the <unk> <unk> of the world.
<unk> <unk> <unk> the government <unk> <unk> to <unk> the total of an area of bigger <unk> <unk> of California and <unk> together.
It's their new <unk>. It's called <unk>.
It's a <unk> <unk>. It's going to <unk> all the resources.
One example of how a <unk> can <unk> with his <unk>.
And, finally, I think it's pretty <unk> at least at least <unk> to the <unk> of us have been in these <unk> <unk> <unk> on the planet, and realize that they don't have any <unk>.
For somebody is home.
<unk> <unk> of the human imagination that we <unk> to <unk>. And for all of us, the dreams of these kids, like the dreams of our children, become part of the <unk> <unk> of hope.
And to end, we <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> never <unk> to anything.
<unk> that <unk> --
They <unk> are not <unk>, but we believe that stories can change the world, and maybe we are the best <unk> to tell the stories of the world. Every month our <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> our <unk> <unk>.
Our <unk> are <unk> by millions of people.
Our work is <unk> in <unk> to bring our public to <unk> our public places that have seen and, <unk> <unk>, and <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, the world's world of <unk> in diversity, and we have to <unk> a <unk> world.
where the <unk> of all the <unk> can <unk> our <unk> <unk>.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope other that you've already heard and <unk> some <unk>, in case you don't <unk> them.
I'd like to start with what I call "the <unk> <unk>."
The <unk> <unk> of what?
The <unk> <unk> of all the <unk> society. The <unk> <unk> <unk>: "If we want to <unk> the <unk> of our citizens" "The way to do it is <unk> the freedom <unk>."
The reason is, on one hand, in fact that the freedom is <unk> itself in itself a value, is <unk>, <unk>, <unk> for humans.
And then it's in fact that if we are <unk>, each of us can act to do everything we <unk> our <unk>, without no one that we're going to <unk> our <unk>, without any <unk> in our name in the name.
The way to <unk> the freedom is to <unk>.
<unk> the more choices, they are <unk>, more <unk> is their freedom, more of the <unk>, the <unk> of their <unk>.
This, <unk>, it's so <unk> <unk> in the society that nobody <unk> to <unk>.
And it's <unk> <unk> in our lives.
I'm going to show you some examples of what progress made possible.
This is my <unk>. It's not particularly big.
I'm going to give me a simple note about the <unk> to <unk>.
In my <unk>, there are <unk> <unk>, without <unk> the 10 <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that you can buy a huge number of <unk> in the <unk> <unk> that nobody <unk> already <unk> is to <unk>.
This is what <unk> is like.
Then you go to the store <unk> <unk>. <unk>: <unk>, <unk>, radio, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
And in this <unk> store, there's a big number of <unk> <unk>.
We can do six million different <unk> using the <unk> that there are in a only store that there are only a store.
We'll be <unk> <unk>.
<unk> fields: the world of <unk>.
Once, when I was a child, you could get all the <unk> <unk>, to <unk> that were <unk> by <unk> <unk>.
It's <unk> the phone, you don't <unk> it.
And a <unk> of that, in the way, was that the phone never <unk>.
These days, they went to.
We have a <unk> almost <unk> <unk>, especially between cell phones.
Here's the cell cell phones.
My <unk> is in the middle, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk>.
If you're not seen it in the store under the <unk>, you're <unk> <unk> that soon you're going to be <unk>.
And what is the end of the thing happens is that people <unk> into the <unk> and <unk> this question? And you know, what is the answer is, "No."
It's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn't make things.
So, in other <unk> of life that are much more important than the <unk>, <unk> the same <unk> of choices.
<unk> <unk>: It's not going on in the United States that you're going to go out of the <unk> and the <unk> you're going to do.
Instead, you go out from the <unk>, and the <unk> says, "OK, we could do it." Or, "A," or <unk>, "<unk>," <unk>, "<unk>," <unk>, "<unk> has these <unk> and these <unk>. What do you want to do?"
You said, "<unk>, what do you want to do?"
And the <unk> says, "He's got these <unk> and these <unk>, and <unk> <unk> these <unk> and these <unk>."
"What do you want to do?"
And you were saying, "<unk> if she was me, what would you say?"
And the <unk>: "But I'm not her."
The result we call the "<unk> <unk>," <unk> "," <unk> "<unk>", "<unk>" <unk> "," <unk> "."
But actually it's not that a <unk> <unk> the weight and the responsibility of making decisions from somebody who knows something, <unk> the <unk>, to <unk> something that doesn't know, and so much of course, is <unk> -- and so not in the <unk> to make the patient.
There's a huge <unk> of <unk>, <unk> to people like me and you, that if you think about that has no sense, because we can't <unk>.
But if we can't <unk>, why can't we <unk> them?
The answer is that they want you to call the <unk> to <unk> the <unk>.
<unk> that is so fundamental as our <unk> is our <unk> now is a matter of choice, as you see in this <unk>. "We don't want to <unk> kids. We don't want to <unk> a <unk>: we have to <unk>.
And we can <unk> how many times we <unk>.
which means that every <unk>, you have to decide that kind of person you want to be.
We went to the family and <unk>, a <unk> perspective of common, <unk> to almost anyone, was that <unk> you can get the <unk> as possible, and they were <unk> to <unk> the <unk> possible possible.
The only real choice was with who, not when, and even what to do after.
<unk>, everything is really to play.
They're going to get very smart, and they <unk> their 20 percent <unk> <unk>.
And not because they're <unk>, not because they're <unk>.
But why they're <unk>, we're going to <unk>, "<unk> or not? <unk> it?"
"<unk> <unk> later? I have to think about the kids or <unk>?"
I'm <unk> <unk>.
And they try to answer these questions, even if this <unk> doesn't <unk> the <unk> that you can't get the <unk> that you can't get a good <unk> to my <unk>.
And they have to do that. They're important questions.
Now, the job: we're <unk>, as <unk> <unk>, because technology <unk> us to work every minute, every day, from every day of the planet, <unk> that from the <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, there's a <unk>, and I'm not going to say anybody, where the <unk> works.
I don't tell you, because I want to use it.
What does, this incredible freedom of choice we have about the work? It's we have to decide, <unk> at any moment, if we have to work or not.
We can go to see our child, <unk> in a <unk>, the <unk> in a <unk>, the <unk> in the other, and the <unk>, <unk>.
And even if I'm all <unk>, every minute we see our child, we're also <unk>, "I've got to <unk> this call?"
"I have to answer this <unk>? I have to <unk> this letter?"
And even when the answer is, "not," all of the experience of your <unk> <unk> son, very different from what would be in other conditions.
So, from any part of us, we look, little things, and <unk> materials and <unk>, life is a question of choices.
Once the world was this: <unk>, there were some possibilities, but not everything was a <unk>.
The world today's <unk> to this: <unk> is, "It's a <unk> thing, or <unk>?"
The answer is <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> we know we all know, so I'm going to talk about the <unk>.
We have this choice is two effects of people.
The first, <unk>, is that it <unk> instead of <unk>.
With a lot of <unk> between which you choose, it becomes very difficult to do it.
I'll give you an example of <unk>: a study <unk> <unk> <unk>.
A <unk> of my <unk> had access to the data, the <unk> <unk> <unk>, with about a million <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk>.
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are <unk> over, the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> of two percent.
With 50 <unk> <unk>, there's 10 percent <unk> <unk> than when they are only five. Why?
Because with 50 <unk> between which <unk>, is <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> to <unk>.
And <unk>, and yet <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and of course, <unk> never comes to.
<unk> that doesn't mean just that these <unk> <unk> <unk> food to <unk> because they don't have enough money, you also want to say that the decision is so <unk> that you also <unk> <unk>.
They're not <unk>, they're <unk> up to <unk> <unk> for year from <unk> <unk>, that would be well <unk> to <unk>.
So, the <unk> is a <unk> of <unk> to have <unk> choices.
And I think we're going to be the world.
"And finally, to end up, <unk>, <unk> or <unk>?"
You could just take the right decision, if it's for <unk>, isn't it?
You don't want to choose the wrong wrong, and you'll get the wrong wrong wrong.
So this is the first effect. The second is that even if we can <unk> <unk> and make a choice, at the end, we're less <unk> by the result of how you <unk> you have been with less <unk> between which choice.
And this for several reasons.
One of them is that with a lot of <unk> between which, if you take one and not perfect, it's easy to imagine that we could make a different choice that would be better. And what happens is that <unk> <unk> us to <unk> the decision, and the <unk> <unk> from the decision, and the <unk> <unk> <unk> from the decision,
even when it was a decision.
More choices there are, more choices to <unk> than <unk> <unk>.
<unk>, there's what <unk> call.
Dan <unk> has <unk> very well <unk> like the value we give things to things to what the <unk> with.
And so, when you get a lot of <unk>, it's easy to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and be less than the <unk> <unk>.
Here's an example. I'm <unk> with all the ones that are not in New York.
But that's what you probably <unk>.
There's this <unk> to the <unk>.
A <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>. <unk> day. It's all about them.
It's not going to do. But what he's, "Well, <unk>, it's <unk>."
"All my <unk> <unk> are away."
"<unk> <unk> right in front of the house."
And it goes two weeks, we're going to <unk> -- every day -- the possibility of <unk> where it wants.
The <unk> <unk> for what we have, even when the choice was <unk>.
And the more is the <unk> we have <unk>, the <unk> <unk> us to <unk> them up as <unk>.
Here's another example.
This <unk> tells us a lot of things.
We talk about living the moment, and maybe maybe in slowly.
But the most important thing is that anything you're going to, you're not going to do other.
The things that don't <unk> have a lot of <unk> that can make less <unk> what we do.
<unk> <unk>: <unk> <unk>.
I tried it on my skin <unk> a new couple of <unk>.
It's going to be <unk>.
Once the <unk> were just kind of, <unk> them and <unk> <unk>, they were <unk>, only after they had to <unk> a life and <unk> a lot of times, we were <unk> to go well.
So, I went to <unk> a couple of when the <unk> <unk>, and I said, "I need a couple of <unk>, this is my <unk>.
The <unk> said, "<unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>?"
<unk> them wants to the <unk> or with <unk>? "<unk>" or "<unk>"?
"Do you want to <unk>?"
"<unk> <unk> them wants to <unk> or <unk>? <unk> <unk>..." <unk> <unk>.
I was <unk>, and after a little <unk> I could say, "I want the guy that was the only guy that was, so on, so I was <unk> <unk>, and then I was <unk>, and then you <unk> it, and then you <unk> it, with the <unk> <unk>, and then you <unk> it out of the store, and I had ever <unk>.
It was the <unk>. And I had all <unk> the better.
But I'm worse.
Why? I wrote a whole book to <unk>.
The reason I was worse is that with all that choice my <unk> were <unk>, the <unk> <unk> to be <unk>.
I had <unk> <unk>. I didn't <unk> me when I only had a guy, but when I had 100 different, <unk>, at least a guy had to be perfect.
What I had <unk> was good, but not perfect.
After I <unk> that I <unk> with what I was <unk> in <unk> to <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> in the life of people don't do <unk> <unk> that these <unk> <unk>.
And this <unk> <unk>, even when the results are good.
<unk> in the world of <unk> if we realize it.
Because if I <unk> it, I'm not going to talk about what I'm talking about.
The truth is more to do this.
"It was better when you was worse." The reason why he was better when he was worse was possible to <unk> <unk>.
<unk>, in the world that we live -- <unk>, <unk> citizens with the <unk> of the <unk> -- the <unk> that we can <unk> is that things are <unk> to be <unk>.
You never have to <unk> <unk> because your <unk>, my <unk>, are <unk>.
The <unk> of happiness -- what you are here -- is, "<unk> <unk>," Yes, you want. "
I mean -- little <unk> moment -- I'm really <unk> and my wife is really <unk>.
I couldn't do better, I didn't <unk>.
But <unk> is not always a <unk> thing.
<unk>, a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> when there's only that kind of <unk> is that when you're not <unk>, and you say, "Why?"
"Who's <unk>?" The answer is <unk>.
The world is the <unk>. What could I do?
When you have hundreds of types of <unk>, and you get one <unk>, and you'll get to you who's the <unk>, it's clear that the <unk> is <unk> the <unk>, you're you.
They could do better.
With hundreds of <unk> <unk>, there are not <unk> for <unk>.
So when people make decisions, even if the result is <unk>, you get <unk> and <unk> to them.
In the last few years, the <unk> is <unk> in the <unk> world.
I think a <unk> <unk> -- not the only, but important -- of this <unk> <unk> of <unk> is just that people have <unk> experiences because the standard are too <unk>.
And when they have to <unk> this situation think the <unk> is they.
So the final result is that we're better, we're better, we're better, we're better <unk>.
Let me show you.
This is the <unk> <unk>, what we all take for for good and it's completely <unk>. It's not true.
There's no <unk> that a little bit of choice is better than you don't know at all, but by this is not going to be much better than a little bit.
There's a <unk> value, <unk>. I don't know what it is.
But I'm quite sure we've <unk> from a piece of the level of the level of choices that are <unk> our life.
Now, from a <unk> point of view -- I almost finished -- from a <unk> point of view, the <unk> is the <unk>.
What you all this choice in the <unk> society is the <unk> material.
There are many places in the world, and you're going to <unk>, where the problem is not that they have <unk> choice.
The problem is that they have too <unk>.
So the <unk> I'm talking about is a <unk> <unk> of the <unk>, <unk> <unk> society.
And what <unk> does <unk> and <unk> is this: <unk> <unk> <unk> you yesterday about how much those <unk> and <unk> to <unk> are <unk>. It's a <unk> <unk> of money.
I mean that these choices, <unk> and <unk>, it's not that they're just <unk>.
I'm <unk> <unk>.
They do do it worse.
If a little of what we're in our society <unk> choice was <unk> in those where people have too much <unk>, it would not only their life to <unk>, but also our.
This is what <unk> call a <unk> <unk>.
A <unk> of the income <unk> to all -- not only to the poor -- because of that choice in <unk> that we're <unk>.
And so, you can become everything you want --
<unk>, people of culture, <unk>, "What do that fish?"
"It's <unk> that you can't make anything in a <unk> of glass."
"A <unk> imagination, a <unk> vision of the world --
And I <unk> it like this, I <unk> it.
But then, I realized that that fish knows the long <unk>.
Because the reality is that if you <unk> the <unk>, so that you can't <unk> the <unk>, so that you can't <unk> the freedom. It <unk> the <unk>.
If you <unk> the <unk> so that everything you could <unk> the <unk>.
<unk> the <unk>, and <unk> <unk>.
They need a <unk>.
This is almost certainly too <unk>, maybe even for the fish, and certainly for us.
But <unk> <unk> <unk> is a <unk> for <unk> and <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
Thank you very much.
