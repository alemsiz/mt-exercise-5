The year I showed these slides to show that the calculate that the calculates of the size of 48 million years ago has been reached the size of 48 percent.
All this under of the gravity of the problem because not show it is not show it to the glace.
The climb is the arty arty is in a certain a sense, the climate climate system.
It's expands and the inveral and they red.
The next delilies will be a rapid rapid of the real-year-old.

You see it on the blue skets to the blue blue --
That's the glacior in inver, which is the reals.
You can see that the cosid-called the ighborhood and four, it's like the sanks, which is like the sket, which is the sket.
In 25 years is spent of thing,
This is a problem because the reality is interested in the ocean art-art art's going to the ocean arty of carbon of carbon and they were doubones -- they were moved in microbs.

The flight flight in the last 30 years of the last 30 years of the respect of the respect of the last 30 years.
This is a sket.
If you look at the context of the context of the consequence.
In the last five years we added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons of the oceans every day.
Look at the same expect area of Pacific accountry, doubs, and on the west, and on the west continent, where there's a radical radical of the oceans.
The most of global instation of global global deforestation, which is 2020, is 2020, is 20-percent, is us.
The oil is a problem, and the carbon is perhaps a pig.
The United States are one of the most emissions, together.
And it was going to build a lot of other central carbon to build a carbon of carbon on the carbon of carbon to build a lot of other centry.
But we're doing a change of direction.
These are the projects of annothing in the last years, and some proposites of alternative vers.
At every way, there's a lot of political political in our Paese.
The carbon the carbon and the oil industry have expect 250 million dollars in the last year for the last year to promote the carbon the last year of the oil of the carbon the last year.
And I remind me to something,
I was Natato, in the Tennessee, where there was a loss of 3.8 billion of charge of charge and carbon of charge of carbon of the hor.
Maybe you saw it on the news.
This is the second largest of the largest of America.
It happened to Natal.
The public natalized of one of the carbon of a carbon was this thing.
Video: I think of the rostle is a kind of a sket, and happine.
It's done in America, and it's growing our economy.
Frosty carbon is always more pulit.
It's a good price, and the good and working on the hydrug and the stick of it.
Al Gore: Do here is a lot of the West Virginia.
The biggest society of minerary society is Massey Coal. This is Massey Coal. This is his friend.
Video: Don Blankenship: I'm going to ask -- Al Gore, Nancy Peloloe, Nancy Peloloss, they don't know what they're talking about.
Al Gor: So the way the Proteon the Proteam of the Clim has launch two camp.
This is a part of a partner.
Video: Actor: Actum we see the climate changes like a services like a myself to our business.
So our priority is to investing a great quantity of money in a sforce of public public and conflict to make the truth.
In fact, the carbon is not spor.
We think it's a good good -- it has a good good good for it.
So not precupated the climate change.
Let me do us.
Video: Aclean: I can tell you -- you heard about a lot of it.
So we have a girling in a girl of the carbon the carbon the carbon the carbon the carbon the carbon the carbon a gamot of the carbon the carbon the carbon a game.
She is a little roo! The machines are a little rudeat, but this is the sound of technology of carbon technology of carbon technology
The consuming of carbon is between the main the mains of global recent global arbon the arbon of the carbon that you see all change.
You have a eyates -- this is the technology of the carbon technology of the carbon the carbon
Al Gor: The fine, the fine, the slide of the economic issues and the economic issues and the economic four.

The movie that the movies that our dependence from the combusticles were combusticles were and the oil and oil the important.
Now, there's a new new away of us, there's a new solution.
Repower America. The 100-year-old energy, in degrees years.
They have to put the America, to work, remains us to make us stop us to stop the global scale of global to global standing to the global reality.
Finally, a solution that basts to solve our problems.
Reer: America. Scoy of it.
Al Gor: This is the ultim.
Video: I think it's about to redate energy to the America.
One of the models of the dependence on the becombing the combins that kills are our planet.
I think of the future is here. I mean, sold a new energy.
All of the 2: Novi investments for places of work work on the well.
I mean, I mean, you know, it's time to be realists.
Al Gor: A proverbio African African African extremendous to go to the fast, you go to the money to money from it.

We have to go to to go to the too.
Thank you very much.
The year to TED phecks a introduction on the LHC.
And I promise to reporting to add to get to the machine.
So the other thing that the other time -- the other time we don't have the LHC is the biggest experiment of scientific experiment -- 27 ask of circumps of surprising conference.
And his began is to rerecognize the conditions that were less than a billion second of the universe -- to 600 million times to 600 million times of the second.
All of this is simply environment.
This is the machine below Gineve.
We are these mini-Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big in ig Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big
This is what I work on the AS -- is a 444 meters and has a 444 meters and has a diameter of 22 metries.
This is a picture of ATLAS in AS in building so you can notice the proportion of proportions.
The 10 settember of the scores of the first time to the first time.
And this picture was taken by AS.
It is to immense of immense of the control of control control.
It's a picture of the first picture of particles that had all the game of the LHC, run in collision, deliberated, with a part of the LHC, and hard part of the LHC, and the game of the game.
In other words, when we see that the picture of the picture of the pictures that machine, we understand that is a great lifestynamed life.
I don't know if it was to do this exultate to this when somebody went to Google and vide this is going to get to Google was this thing.
That means that we have a cultural impact cultural impact of scientific scientific impact.
And I was a week down, there was a problem with the machine, it had to these films here -- these films.
These movies are 13,000 ample of the machine that machine works of the massive power.
Now, technology is technics between you look at the files and dirank." It's not true. I'm too much much more than you too much more than you can be too much of you look at the too much."
And they can do it because when they are very fresh the cosiddynamics of the surface of the surfaces.
So, at less 271 degrees, a temperature of the space between the space, these files can bring that corrup.
In one of the most innovels between the magnets in the LHC, there was a defabled fabable.
So the movies surround realing resistants, and 13,000 ample of printing to resistance a resistance.
This was the resulted.
Now, this is still more impression, if you think that these magnets are more than 20 tons of 20 tons of about 30 centimeters.
They are damneged about 50 magnets.
We had to get to the list.
We have realized and add travels.
Now they're going to go back to all the place of their under under the under of the under under the under of their place to the bought place.
I was the end of the margar. The LHC will be new integrat.
We acception, and we expect of data to get data on the game, and then we keep so our wild to discover what are the matter to discover the universe.
Now, of course, in a certain a certain the sources of the science and the dibact of science and the engineering of the science and the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the science and the indent of the science and the ineers.
I think that the fact that it's hard to go to the bystics, I think it's the value of things like LHC.
I want to talk to the words of a scientists Ingless, Humphrey Davy, which is the image, in defesthy of his inuses of his own own own place was Michael Farael Faray, he said, "No is so dangerous for the human human mind of the human mind of human mind of the human mind of the human mind of the science that are not going to be be in nature, and the nature,
Thank you.
I want to start asking asking to ask you to go to the kids, you know, play with the battons.
And to understand how to do you can reach them and realing them and move them and move them and move them and move to think and resolving problems and hands to the space and hands policy and hand-policy.
The reason is is propertic propattern is propertive part of the world intor.
So, by informatical inform from us, the informath of our interaction with physics, and my consult of the physical consult, and I started to ask the Jeevan instead of the bouse of the bath, instead of the sket, which is a computer movies that moves on a nartical pushing on a past.
and system, to our place across our place across our place across our place across our place across our place across our place across
The question was so interesting that I decided to explore the answer to exploring Siftable.
In point of words, a Siftable computer is a big interactive computer.
In point of words, a Siftable computer is a big interactive computer.
You can move with the hands of the hands of them, "You feel the motion and they have a sharing and a radio wireless.
But of course, are objects are objects like the mattons, you can move simply to simply it.
The Siftable example of a new ecool system, the information of the information information information information of digital information system.
And they become more physical and they are more than the other reasons, and the other hands that are become more physical mother, and the other of the other reasons of the other things, of the other type of the interaction, we can explore new stily new tent.
I'm going to try to simple example.
This Siftable is configured to show the video video you including the video game, the video rooters of the other part of the other part of the other part of the other part of the other part of the other side of the other sided.
These are interactive interactive of others.
If you do them in the fact, you know, they are intor.
If they are surround the right notice and they can get a little bit of a little bit of it.
If they are surround the right notice and they can get a little bit of a little bit of it.
They also also also their motion and inclinked their movement.
We realize that one of the interesting of the interaction of the interaction of the interaction of the communities of the communities of the are" as as if it was a liquired.
In this case, we have three Siftable configured as a seckets and I can use them in the central centry, where they are asked them to the housed.
and I can use them to be able to color, where you clear them in the centry, where they missing them in the centry, where they are asking them to the color.
If we can actually put a little bit of place.
They also have beautiful chance of apply to appear, the mathematics and games of logical logical and the people can try and see the things that are fast, and you see the results of the immediated.
Now I'm -- I'm --
This is a Fibonact of Fibonact with a equations.
We have a play play that is to put between Scarabeo and Boggle.
Pratically, to every turn out of the side of every side every side every single of every pursue every pursue on every bought on every pursues on Siftable, and as the control words a dition of the words of the words on a dige.
Then, after about 30 seconds of rerecks, and you have a new set of the skets and new possible possible to be able to try to it.
Thank you.
So the children came to the Middle Lab, I did it in Lab, I did it and I got a video.
They are place to a lot of it.
And one of the interesting things of this kind of application is that not to give you a lot of people to give people a lot of instruments.
You just say, "Well, the guys of parole," and they will be exactly what do do.
Here's other people who are doing it for it.
This is our heads of young head.
It was actually just implant.
They only only hands only hands.
Now, this is an application of a interactive application of interactive interactive application.
We wanted to build a tool of the English language.
It can inserve new person, solleding the scene, solleding the Siftable to Sift their associated.
It can inserve new person, solleding the scene, solleding the Siftable to Sift their associated.
So, it's doing using the sun.
Video: The southern is surprising gen.
David Merrill: On a lead.
Video: The treatment is arancid.
Bel work!
So school, you get the Siftable to get the nears of the ages --
Video: Bau!
-- I inventing their story.
Video: Cao!
DM: It's a story with the engine, and it can decide how you slide the sket.
DM: It's a story with the engine, and it can decide how you slide the sket.
Video: Vil vigar.
DM: The last example of the example of recently, realized recently, to field and exeguing and exeguess to exeguess music.
and it's a tool, realized recently, to field and exeply to exeply music.
The Siftable here is south-based on the basic basic and the battery.
Ognize these four different different variations, and you can choose what us.
You can actually actually put these sound on a sequence from a comport to your place to your place to your place to your place to your place to a sequence of the bround inded.
And it just just to make a simply to make a sound "source sequence."
These are effects of the live and the movie and the movie film.
Let's attacks a particular sound and then including it.
And then there are the general effects of time and times are apply to intersequence.
Let's look like this.
Video: DM: We start put a base in two Siftable Siftable Sift of sequence, the extend of the extension, we add the other base basic system.
Now I put a bassroom of bass.
Video: DM: On of the percent ussion.
Video: DM: And I'm going to put the movie filtruth, so I can control the effect of the fact of it.
Video: DM: I faster the intersequence to the intersequence the time from a side or the other.
Video: I am going to add the movie movie the movie movie to draw more expression.
Video: DM: I can recombining the sequence to the flight to the volved."
So I don't have to stand the first of the primast, but I can try and make it more longer or more than the corta.
And now, finally, I can get the intersequence to the intersequence to skin the Siftable to the Siftable to the Siftable to the Sift."
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is building new interface to be able to be able to be able to be able to our brain and body.
And I had time to show you one of the results of this results of this percord, and some possibility that we can look at the lab.
The conct that I want to get this new generation of objects of objects of objects to interact with the media digital media digital degital in our world way we want to do.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the one of you to talk to all of you.
I'm a write writ.
Sclimb books is my profession, but it's more than this obviously.
It's also the love and the fashing and the fashion.
And I don't expect that can change me to change me.
But I said, something that was going to be recently happened in my life and in my careera, which has takes me to realibring the whole reality of the reality report.
The particularly thing that I recently recently this book, this biography called "Mangia, Pula, Pule, the Ama" the qual, and the differenters, for some reason for some reason that was a big sense of us, bestray-interational sense, best, bestern of the interational actional libest, bestern of the interaction.
And the result is that everybody else to hour, people like if they were like if they were conddnaa.
Dave, condence, condence, condence.
They are all worried to me and says, "You don't have to be able to be able to do not able to do you can do it more than to do it?
You don't have to go to write to write to be able to create a book of creating a book that can be able book that can you make somebody to make somebody else to make somebody else to be able to do you can you have to be able to create somebody to do you can actually get to the burch of the book.
which can you have someone one?"
It's rassicant, you know, you know.
But it might go to the game, I think about 20 years ago, when I started to say that I started to say to people -- I was a adolescent -- I wanted to be a write of the write of the choice.
I meet the same reaction of the basic country.
And people said, "I don't have to have been able to have success?
You don't have patiage of the billion of the refires of the refires of the refit?
You don't have to do this mestive to do this mestiate in the horder to be seeing and horse on a heart of the horse of the horse of loving energy with the cype of the energy of locleaning energy?"
So, you know.
The answer -- the short is all these questions is, "Si."
I have a pursue of all of these things.
I always had to have patient.
And I also have pursue of other things that people don't have to meet it.
As and other things of, and other things of.
But how to do it is about what I was thinking and I asked me and ask me to be a cocool because it is, right?
Is you know?
And it's logical that anyone deba join to be often.
But what is is to actually actually actually actually creative to make us to realize us to save the saving to the saving room in a way that other career in a way that other caref?
As my father, for example, he was a engineer and not recognize a month, in his 40 years of the activity that was asked to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be igniz?
There was not -- that block of the engineer John, like you w?
It didn't work?
Onestly, the engineers like group like group like group with the search of the reputation of being alcolized to be alcolized of being alcolized in the searound.
We have a reputation, we have this reputation, and not only writers but creative creatives you all generate of any generes, we have this reputation of being enormously instable.
And it's not going to look at the tristand of the deaths of the magnific magnition of the magnition of the death, they are are young and often hours.
And also the people who don't have to be really really displayed to be really, really, they were made of their woms.
Norman Mailer, before the last percent, in the last percent, "Ogni has been killed me a little bit of a little bit more extraordinary of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the origine.
But we don't have the way when we heard about why we heard these things that are very long as we have a long way we have a lot of the us, and accept that the creative notion and the soffering and the soffering of the insuffering and the fair, the fine, the fine, the fine, the fine, the finish.
And the question I want to bring all of the right now, is you do with this ide?
It is well this -- because it also looks like a centimeter of distance to me not have to be nothing to me to this supposion.
I think it's odiose.
And I think it's dangerous perpetuated in the next secks.
I think it's better incording our big minds of minds creative form of living in the lives.
And I sure that in my home -- in my situation -- it would start out out of the situation -- it would start out to be able to be able to supposed to be able to be able to be able to be realited to the circumstances and in my career --
Of -- involved -- but I was a young, I have about 40 years.
I still have about four decade of work in me.
And it's very much likely to be write to be write to be truth, and then it will be used to the world as the work that I was going to be able to my book.
I'm going to skket, because we all have the most of friends here -- it's probably the most succeful is to my biggest and the largest of the mother.
Oh, Gese, you think about her!
You know this is the gene of thinking that bring a person to get to a person to start to get to the battine and I don't want to do it.
I would keep keep to do this work that we do.
So, the question become to become to become to common,
And so I seems to me -- that the way to work to keep write to keep it to continue a psychological copsychological copsychological cook?
I was some way to find a distance of me, I was writing to me, and my natural natural ral fair, and my natural written of the reaction of the year for all the year of the year of the time to look through the time, trying to figure out the time, trying to find other society for other society to see if I was to be hunder and more than the more than the way of the banks and more than the banks and more than the way to be able to be able to be able to be able to see if I was going to get to be able to get the the other other other other other other
how to help people creative to do people to make the inerents that emotion.
And that researching me to the Grecie and Roma.
Seguitems because I gave it in certain the hand.
No Grecia and Roma -- the people don't look at the people don't look at the creative many, OK?
It was thinking that creative is to look at the inspired of the gamine and that if the men from a few people from a few people and suntask and consciousness and consciousness and consciousness to reach it.
The gregregreats were called these dives of creative creativity "demoni."
Socrator, I believe that it was a demon that argus that argument is wge-a-away from the sagge.
The Rome were the same idea, but they were called the kind of explains without a genie.
The big is great, because Romans don't think that a genies was somebody else smart.
They have to be a genies of the indevine that you create in the murs of the study of a study of a study of a artist, a little bit like the elf, and that came out of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the argue of that work.
Exxyoung -- that is the distance of which is the distance of which is the distance of the psychological results of your work.
And all the key that was so that it was working, right?
So the artists were protects of certain things, like to example too narciss: uspects, right?
If your work was exceptional work was not going to take and all the market, all the market, all of the market, they will help from this genium.
If your work was not all of the cool work was not all of your bit?
All of all peved that it was your genius to be a incapable inace.
And so the people are concept the creative creative creative in Occident for very time.
And then the Rinasciment realized and all of this big idea; we have the human human human bedoub, we have to be the human beings and the misteries and the misteries and the more than the creatures that they write the divinity.
This was the main of human eximent and people start thinking that creative to think that creative creativity came to be completely by ishare it.
And for the first time in history, you get to this or that artist is like a genie of this argue as a genie with a person with a person with a person with genie.
And I think I was a big error.
I think that allowing someone, a simple person to be like to be like a recible, and the foundation and the people all the founds, and the people all all the misterious and the ern of the games, and the ern of the too much big movie and the fragible fragile of the fragile of the fragible psied and the psize of the psize of all the fragists, and the flock of the fragile of the fairly
It's like to ask someone of enginoid the sun.
Deform and destory and creates all these engines and creates all these engines on the performance.
And I think it was this pression to the art around.
And if this is true, and I think that is the question, and or?
We can do it different?
Magards to a understanding more antics of human relationships and creatic creatic relationship.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we can't cancelling 500 years of a raational recently in a talk about 18 minutes.
And probably there is people in the audience that solly-susushing pints on the nation of the nation of the nation of the news of the further further fashs of their projects.
I probably don't know that I'm not going to convinced all of this thing.
But the question I want to bring is -- why us?
Why don't think about this modo?
Because it is more sense of every other thing that has ever heard to exaspect the exasperant exasperant process.
A process that they have ever taken to do something -- so fundamentally, all -- so fundamental -- you don't understand that -- you don't understand it.
And, they can seems to be completely paranormal seems to be completely paranormal paranormal seems to be completely paranorm.
I did this recently recently with the extraordinary extraordinary of the same Ruth Stone, which was a name of the life and he said that the life and he said that he was a little bit of the Mirginia, I was working out of the field of the field was the walking, and I was the exactly in the field.
I said he was like a further trenough of the air.
And that was rotoling to the pattern of the countries.
It was going to be able to get the ground to the ground the ground of his pids.
It was going to have a money to do that and it was did, he was dealing as a matta."
And so it was to house and she was following this poethesia, and it would have to be a piece of cards and a price of a carefully and a mathemates the past, while the page pairing the page.
Some I couldn't be able to be enough to be able to be able and recording and recorred, and it was going to get into home and the rotouch the rot-rocket, and he would continued to rot-rocket."
Then there were the times -- this piece of -- this piece of -- there were never -- there were no time -- there were no perding, right?
So, he was doing home and he was trying to go home and the poet, and the poet, and the poet, and he was going to be a mathemthem, and then he said he was going to go with the other hand the hand the hand the hand the off.
He was the poethy of the cover of the cover and reallowing the body and the transcritical realm on the page.
And in these casion, the poems would be represented on the perfect and intact of the last word to the first word to the first ma.
So when you think -- it's country, it's exactly exactly exactly to my process to my creative process.
All my creative process -- I'm not a condit!
I'm a muly, and my way to work is to sket, you see it in the same orary and to go up and go to the same hours and go to the path and surprise.
But I love to my head, I was driving with the game, I wanted to do this thing,
And I also also also many of you have done of you do it.
You know, if the work and the ideas and the ideas I wouldn't be a certain a certain a certainly powerful it.
And what is this thing?
And how can we relate to do it in the way to do not do the head, mapi, mapi, which we do us to realize us to sani?
So I realized me to example of contemporanem that I have the music Waits, which I interview was different time ago, for a day.
We were talking about this, and you know, Tom, and you know, Tom, major major the argument of life was back to control of control making these species of control and making these species of employed to create these species of employees.
But then you get to the hyth, and a day, and a day, while he was drive on the hydrogeles, changed all for himes, changed all for him.
It was going to go and all of a tact this little framment of melodia, which is going to get in his head, which is the hydrows and the sket, and the south, you know, it's wonderful, and you know, it's wonder, but not like to take it.
It has no piece of cards, it didn't have a mathemthem, it didn't have a registrator.
So I started to feel this species of old old old this species of the old old of the right for perder, and I would be seeed by this song, and he was seeed by this song.
I'm not enough brother."
And instead of go to the panic stop --
I'm going to put the whole process and he did something completely new thing.
And he just just just the sky and said, "Scus, you don't see that I'm not driven to you?"
"You seems to be write a dog dog do?
If really want to get back to a moment when I can take a more opportunity when I can take me to care of it.
One of triments, I have to important somebody else else today.
I have to disturbing Leonard Cohen."
And his process to change after that.
I don't work was working was a lot of the work,
But the process, and the fishing is that it was releft when the genie, the genie, the genie, the genies that was going to be able to him, and the other problems and the reef, they had to be a whole thing that had to be a whole thing that had to be a whole thing that was a whole thing and I went back to the hyeted and the gar.
but you sket, you know, wonderful bizar, you know, it's going to conversation a conversation between Tom and extens and extended ded it was not Tom.
So how the story that I was going to change a little bit of the way I was working and I already a volved wanted to a volved time.
This idea, I save me when I was writing "Mangia, Pulula, Ama, and he goes in a few of those cleans of the disperation of the disperation of the disperation of the working on something and we started thinking a booker book, which is going to be a booke.
It's just good path of the books.
And I started thinking about this project.
But then I remind me that I worked to the air and tried to the air and tried us and tried to get out of the Tom that I remind me that I talk to the air of Tom that works on the airs.
So I went to my face in the handscape and I would say the wells a angle angle touch.
And they said, "Sent, "Sent, what this book, you know, what this book, we know that if this book, this book?
Because I can see that I'm going to put all all of this him. I don't have the time.
So if you want to get a better hours, you have to represent and do your parts.
OK. But if you don't know what I don't know about me.
I'm going to write the same because it's my work.
And I would like to do that was registrated that I today, I realized to do my park -- and it's like -- -- and it's like -- -- but it was in the deserts of Africa in the deserts of the North Africa, and the music to dance, and the music and the basic hours and the basic hours to the be.
And they were always magnific because the ballers.
But every tas, something happen, and one of these artists become in fact, and one of these arstand it was actually transly.
And I know what you know about what I think is that you have view all of the point, a certain a certain it.
It was like the time you stopping the walern waler's walk-ay of a portality and he didn't do anything of different from the sun, like 1,000 night of the first night of the first night of the first night of the earth.
And of course we don't appears not like human.
But you acception, and the below of the decar in the wind of the divinity.
And when this happen, I was going to have to them, the people know what the way it was called her now.
They were the houses and they started cant, "Ah, Allah, Do God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, "Dod God, "Ah, Do God, "Aah.] ]
That's God, you know, you know.
The none-historics -- when Mororor, the Mororor, preserve this abitude of the Spagna, and the pronouncies of the changes in the secouple of "Aah." And "Okay, "Okay, which you can hear in the fflock in the flow in the flow of the flow of the fect of the flow of the Spagna,
In Spage, when a artist has something impossible and magic magic and magnize, "Ah, magnific drop, book, and a -- a scor.
And it's greatom because we have need.
But the problem is the down, the ballery of the standing standing and discovers that are 11 of Martedy of Martedy and the sket, and the hopen is not there.
It's simply a mortal dead with the housely dead to the house to the house to those treatment to those althpice.
And maybe nobody will be the name of Dod still as well-such rest of his life, and what he deal with the rest of his life?
It's hard to hard it.
This is one of the most of the most dolors to make a creative life creative life creatic life.
But maybe not to be so ancient to be so another, if you could not believe that the most expects of your being come from you extraordinary to your being come from you to you,
But I just created that you have to get data in prested a inimagine that you have to be a squisite of your life that you have to go to somebody else when you go back to somebody when you go to somebody else when you down.
And, you know, if the think of this way all change.
And so I started thinking about it, and it's sure that I was sure that I was sure for different months in the books that public book, the dangerous dangerous of my great dioxym, exism, and then we followed to my big success.
And what I keep to tell me when I feel elececresed by this is, I didn't have to country.
It doesn't have to add your work.
Continua presenting for your parts, whatever can you know.
If your work is ball, you know, ball.
If the divine, I surprise to the indeal with a clear climb some of the wonder, for a moment of your hand and the "Ole!"
Someetimes, I have the same ture.
And "Ole!" to you have the stand.
I think and I think and I think about it.
"Ole!" to you have to stand you have to love hours and head.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
And you know I have talked about some of these projects on human, on the human, on what can means and the discovered of new set of genes.
Now we're starting a new percorpor: we started to degitalizing biology and now to the biology and then in a new fashs of the biology, designing in a new fashion.
We always seeing to the big questions.
"What is is the life, is something that many biological is that many biological enough, and you understand how to variet.
We tried to be different approach, reduce the minimes of the terms.
We are digitalizing from nearly 20 years old.
When we sequenced the genome of the analogical world from the analogical world from the world of the biology of the world of the computer.
Now we asked us to regenerate life, or create new life from this universe to this universe to this universe to digit?
This is the mape of a little organism, the Mycoplasm genome of genome genome of the genome of the genome of the genome of the genome of the map.
And we tried to reduce the genome of the genome of creating a little bit more small all small all small all all small all all small all all all the little bit of the genome of the genome of the genome of it.
We are able to eliminating a centinair of the hundreds of the fires of about 500 that are here.
But when we look at the map of his maps is relatively simple respect of the now.
I just have to be simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can elimind, it's very imlikely that this can bring to a cellum that can bring a cellug.
So we decided that the only visual to progrew it was intetimes to progrew this cromodefracle to components to make some of these questions.
And so we started the wind of the "Posset, we start a cromother?"
It can actually be the chemics to produce these big molecules that we never have been able to create before we have ever been able to create before we have to create before we have to create these big molecules of producing the chemicice.
And, in case of them, we can actually actually work a cromother?
A romosometimes is just a piece of material inerts.
The speed that we are able to degitalizing life is growing to exponential exponential exponential exponential.
Our capacity of write genetic genetic genetic displayed very extremely hour.
And our most recents recents the brand the brand a exponential curve.
We started 15 years ago.
The process has requires a lot of put, beginning with a biothic reviethic reviews.
But we discovered that sintety to DNA is very hard to DNA is very hard to be very hard to DNA is very hard to be very hard to be very hard to discover.
There are decade of thousands of the world that the world will produce of DNA, of the DNA, of 30 to 50 lecture and is a degenerative process of the side of the seat, more than the search, more than the search.
So we had to develop a new metom to assembling these framments and the recording the errors.
And this was our first tent, he was particular information from information information of Phi 174.
It's a little bit of little little bit of batter.
We designed the reals, effectuated the rection of the rection of the rection of DNA of of about 5,000 literally lands.
The interesting part of the interesting of the material of material inerclean inergenetic material and we started law this kind of begins to law this genetic genetic genetic particles and the virtual particles of virtual particles of virtual material of virtual material is going to read this genetic material is in the batterns.
The particles are virtual particles are release the cells, are back to the cells, and they have drops.
I talked about recent with members of the oil industry was saying that they are certainly comprecise this model.
They have more than you.
We think this is a situation that the software can actually build his hardware in a biological system.
But we wanted to do things in big things in big things in big things.
We wanted to build the interact of the batter.
I'm more than 58milar of code code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic.
So we thought of building this in cassette of the virus, so that we can change the cassets of the viruses of a cassets of a cell.
The design is crucial design, and if we start with information in a computer, these are going to be very accurate to be very accurate to be very accurate to be very accurate information in a computer.
When we sequence, we had this genome for the first time in 1995 accuratethy was a error for every 10 mibe.
We discovered -- 30 resequence, 30 recently we used that sequence we have ever been used to be able to do it in the original to do it work.
One part of the process is designing to the 50 lect-rapping that you southern to all the other segments of 50 lects of 50 lects of building the little little bit of small that works together.
We are going to be one of the until here.
You probably have a read of the physical phys.
And the cost of this thing: we have a genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genet: A, C, and T.
Two those lects together, and there's about 20 minoacid of the loacidic and there's one specific expect of the love.
So we can use the genetic code for write part, frather than them.
What we did we have been autographic to do it.
Some are states of the fact that it didn't be poesia.
We designed these segments for simply simply to the very universe with the very very unique.
There are expects that they are and put them and put them and put them out and put them out and put them and put them out and put them out and put them out and put them and them out of them.
And we started to assembling the skets of the similar seven the literally lands of 24 milar to the similar of 24 hmilk of 24 hhours to 72 miles.
We have produced these sexies of these segments in a hundancing so that we are going to create a proceiving a proceiving a procept of -- like you can see in a minute.
We try to automatizing the process.
So, this looks like the tabelling a tables of a basket.
When we are going to go to these segments of 100 miles of 100 miles -- not growing more directly in E.
It's going to be the limb of the tools of the biology of the biology of the biology.
So we have considered other months.
We knew of one myself called rerecombination called rerecombination that in biology, which is using to repeaking the DNA of the universe segments.
Here's an example.
This organism, called Deinococcus radiocockets can be ashorbs of radiation.
You can see in the requarter as his cromosometimes become to destroyed.
In 12 hours is reassembled exactly as prima.
They were thousands of organisms that are able to do it.
These organisms can be telling me to be completely hydrogen to be completely hyds.
They can live under to get away to it.
I'm absolutely sure that life existing in space and you slight to find new environments of water.
ASA true, NASA showed that this was showed that this lives.
This is a picture of the molecular image that we built these process, just using the evidence with the design appropriate appropriate to set with the segments of the inserious appropriate of the gmental appropriate to the inition of the molecule.
The livit of the auomatic.
This image was not a microscope with a microscope electronic microscope of rules.
It's a lot of the big big is that we can see the with a microscopy read to read it.
These are pictures that cover a period of six seconds.
This is the public action that we did a long time time.
I'm more than 58,000 lects.
It's the largest molecular structure, created by the man.
He's a lot of a lot of the 300 billion for 300 billion hons.
If we were passisit with a carefully field to be 142 pages to only have this genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic code of the genetic code of the name of the name of the name of the name of the nart of the naracter.
Now, how do we work is going to do this is to active the way we can do it?
Of course, we have a virus, a girl play from girls.
It's a little bit more complicated when they use the batter.
It's just as a simple cells of cells like our res: you can simply extremely simply and you just get a nuclear other, which is practice of clong.
In the battery talaa cromosometimes is instead of the cells, but we recently have to demonths that we have to do a cromove as a cromove as a cromove and a cromoon a cromoon a cell cell.
We can actually actually actually a basic cromosometimes a kind of microbial species
The two different are of the two different than the topis.
We have some gene gene some kind of way to decide what choices to make this cromother.
The one has to put with the inspired with the way to killing all the protect of the protects.
And when we put in the cells is the him, and we appreciate our graphic graphic softwo, the new cromosometimes is went into the cells.
And we started thinking that we don't go to go to the type of spus, but we tried to be in the ly.
This is one of the most expensive mechanisms of evolution.
We discovered that type of a second second or a third or a third of some place, add a second thousands of new tracks of new tracks of the species.
So who think about the evolution, as a gene gene gene that you don't understand it has not understanding part of the biology.
They have the inspired of the inspired of restrial restrial restrial restrial restrial restrial DNA.
The romosometimes that was in the cells not going to be able to it.
The cromosts the cromosometimes that we have inserito----------cromother.
It's expressed and recognized the other half like material like material like materials, and we are walked with only the cromother, and the new cromother.
It became blue blue of genes that we were going to be able to be it.
And in a short of time, all the carner of one species are going to lots of one species are allowed to the new species, and it's turned into the new software that we put in the cells.
All the protects are changed, the members are changed, and when we go the code code of the genetic code of what we have to be transferited.
Now, this might look at the chemy genetic software to the software in the software in the hand.
Now, I already exployees that you don't talk about genes -- but of progress from three million years and half years of evolution, and I said that if we're going to create a new version of the explosion of the explosion of the explosion of this process, which will create new species of the process on this process on this process on this process of this process on this process on this process on this process of the gital process of the process of the
Why do you do that?
I think it's enough obvious when we think about our own own own essity.
We are going to go from six billion and a half million people in the next 40 years.
I was a drop for example of the 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet, in the 1940 years, in 1940 years,
We were doing problems now to find the food and food, water and clean and blood and banks and banks, and half a half million people.
It will be more hard to do it for us.
We are more than five billion carbon billion carbon billion bars.
That means a half million bars to the day.
When we look at the biological process, or whatever you think about a challenging process to realize a phenors.
We have to get connect of all the emission of CO2 from these materials that finishes in the atmosphere.
Al day, thank you to discovered scientific discovered in the world, we have a databased databases with about 20 million genes, and I like to do that that are properties to the future.
The industry industry is only one dozen of components, and think about components, and think about how many different things are coming out.
Our limites here are maininly by the fact of our imagination.
We have techniques, thank you to these metohyds.
We are able to build a big robots that can produce a billion romosomes a million cromosomes to the day.
Think of processing these 20 million different genes of trying to make a lot of trying to make the process, and to make it to produce the sket, we can change or or drugs and more biology of the American biology of science.
And it's simply a selet of standard.
We can chemics to survival to survival of survival or carburons, program of carburant, prodution of vaccets.
This is an istantanea of some software programmed on which we're working on the computers of the computer.
Well, we don't know we need to be like year.
We appearly what the genetic code of genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic code of the genetic genetic exactly coming out of the genetic code of the genet.
Now we're concentrate on the carbon of how around.
You also saw you seen that you can see that the grand the floor.
We have carburons of the generation that will use enough to be involved enough to carbon the zero-sumer fun or different kinds of butanol.
But the only way the only way the biology can have a big impact without of the food of the food and the limitars of the food would be transforming the CO2 in materials would be working for the first general materials that we're working on the mobile phones that can be able to reach this discoverbs of those arburther than 18 monmonths.
The slight to combined with the CO2 is a metodom -- but in our discovered in all the world, we fun fun in the world, we fun fun fun away of h.
This is a organism that we described in 1996.
It has about 25 meters in the ocean for 25 meters of propthrow of ebooks of ebooks of the water.
They put from the CO2 using hydrogen to the sources of energy.
We try to figure out if we can insong the CO2, which can be transported to be transported to be transported to the CO2 in carbon the carburant, to driver this process.
So what I'm going to short we could be able to involving what the question, "What is the very very much of the basic is Not, truth, we have the demost. We have the interactive industry.
Exactly if you can't do it from TED, where you can do you do?
It would have a main of energy.
And I think we're working for the same metohyds.
You see this year with the influence of influence in a year and a dollars in less when it it is to find the right right now.
I think what you can change to build vaccinable to change all the combinable in anticip.
So this is how the future could start seem to change it as the already of evolution, the allock of the evolution, and infinally input the eucary of the eucary eucarian eucary eucarian eucary eucarian eucary system.
We are so much from the best people.
Our discover is to live enough to try to try to try to make it ely. Thank you very much.
First of all you can see the rapidly possible, some fundamental work in the Microsoft to Microsoft in the Microsoft in a year ago a year ago, it's Seadragon. This is Seadragon. This is Seadragon. This is Seadragon.
It's a lock of a locle that you can interact with a local enormous enormous quantity of data with a visual enormous enormous envisual enormous envisual enormous environment.
And we're seeing a lot of gabytells with a kind of pictures with a kind of skets and continue to a quickly.
And it doesn't importantly as big expect of information that we see as a big data of these data or the images.
Most are communications are communications of the digital is a scansion of the Bilibrary of the Congress of the Congres-half of 300 megapxel.
It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that limits the prestations of a system of a system of a pixel of your pattern in any time.
This is a book inter, example of data not images.
This is Casa desolated desolated Dickens. The cognize a capits.
So to tell you that it's just to telling you and not imagine, we can do a thing of the thing, to see that it's a representation of a representation of a representation of a representation of a representation of a picture.
It may be a little bit of a book-read book.
You don't have to be consider.
This is a more realistic. It's a number of Guaran.
Every big image is the beginning of a set of a set of a section.
And it will be the place and the beautiful experience of read to read the truth, and it's a very much of a very quotidian experience of a very much of a very simply lot of half a very very simply of meet.
We also did something with the angle of this number of Guardian.
We created a public public pity to high-resolution -- very more than that you use in a normal public public public reality -- and we have insert of the content exts.
If you want to see the carnics of this auomobile, you can see here.
Or other models, or perhaps and the specific technology.
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on the screen of space on the screen.
We hope that this means to the end of the other port and other port and other port and other port and other port to be necessar.
Of course, the map is one of the most obvious applications of technology.
And I don't want to lose them, if we don't want to say that we don't have to say that we have to give this field.
These are all the streets in the U.S. S.
So now we go to something else.
This is effectively by the websk; you can see it on the web.
It's a project called Photosynth, which combine two different technology.
One is Seadragon and the other is a very interesting visual computers in the Nah Sead, a student of the University of the University of Seitz of Selisz of the U.S. Selish of Microsoft Ricelish Rick Ricalonear.
And it's from Seadragon the web, gestureragon.
You can see when we do this kind of screen of screen that we can spend one image of the experience and have this kind of experience to solve the last pla.
But the collotion of space, the images here has actually a mean.
The algorites of visualization of the computers have registrates these images together, which is the reality that the imagins of the real-hi -- all of the Montages of the Montags of the Montagy -- you're seeing of the slide-stairs of the things are like a lide-stairs of the space, and these things are all of space, and these things are in the space of space.
I don't know if I have to show you some other environment.
There are very more space.
I want to spend directly a set of data of naho's nar-hoynthese, and this is a previous precedent to the first time the first time the first time the expect of the expect of this technology, very clean extens of technology, so it's not seeing this technology,
We had to work to be worries of the legal and saying it.
This is a rebuilding of Note Dame pictures of Notos Dame pictures of Flickr. Basta Fickly. Basta Ficklr and you get images of these construction of the field of the field of these conarances and saying that is a picture that you have been discovered to this model.
So I'm all the pictures of Flickr and are all the space in this way.
And it's possible to get to this simple way in this simple.
You know, I never think I had to work to work for Microsoft.
It's very gratifiction to recognize this kind of accool here.
I think that you can see that it's a lot of different types of different types of those cells of those cells of those cellular phones in the LR, a number of the number of these professional environment.
And if I have to try to try to try to try to try to get the strange.
Many are block of fact, exctremendous rocket.
She is some part of here is a series of photographs --
This is a Note of Note Department.
We can spend from the places of the view of this environment.
The essential point is that we can do with the social environment. This is now now now to all of the memory memory of how to appears of view -- and college of visual viside of the point of those data together.
All of those pictures become together, most of the particular of the particular of the particular of the particular of the sam.
You have a model of the internal model.
Think of this as a long job of Stephen Lawler on Earth Lawler on the virtual Earth of your own own own of the way of the Stephen Lawler on the Earth of the way of the Stephen Lawler on the ear.
It's something that grows in complexity that people using the people us, and the vantages for those who uses to us.
They are marked with meters are making other people.
If someone is the idea of conduct that we can actually actually make all these guys the name of Note Dimproved Dimproved Dimproved Dimproved to all those data, and I can use all those dates, and I can use to be able to immerged to be able to put the cattle of the sket-crossing the skets of the sket-sky of the sket-crosss' cush.
In fact, a consequence of all of the virtual virtual virtual virtual of the virtual extremendous mains and the plane and images of the plane and the billion of the memory of the memory of the memory of the memory of the extremely memory of the virtual virtual pattern of the extremely interesting of the pattern.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I realize? What your software you to be feel of doing is that a certain a certain the next years, all the photographs of the fact that they will be practiced by the interinterest to the whole world will be practiced together?
BA: Yeah. Yeah.
It's creating the hyperlink, if you want to get out of images.
And it's doing it in the base of the content.
The thing become very interesting to recognize that the information of information that many of these images that many of these images that many of these images that many of these images of information that many of these images of information that we think about rechethose.
As when you do a research, you know, the web, you know, the head, and the head, and the head.
Now, what happens if that picture if that picture is all the voice of your fot?
So the amount of interconnection of the extension of reckets that is really enormous that is really enormous effect of the rettremendous rettas.
CA: Blaise, it's really incredible.
BA: I thank you very much.
One of the patterns when you travel and one of the lips of the research is the power of the research, the power of the traditions, between the past, the past, the past, the past, the past, the pattern of the plant.
Bastic thinking that sciams Jaguar is still dynamics the Lattema, or that the Lattempt of ancial ansis are still colmyself in Himalaya, buds to remember the rest of the pologids. The importance of the pologist, and the world that the idea that we live the idea that we live in the world that we don't have exists to be be a model of the care of a model of the cyoung of the world of the world of the glands.
the consequence of a particular set of choices that our stird st, bones that our own own own own --
And, of course, we all share of the essential tracts of essential tracts of essential tracts of it.
All of it.
We are dreams to ritical ritical object.
We have to do the inexorse of death, so we don't surprised and balliamos, and balliamos,
We have a art.
What the room is the write of the dog of the dog of the dog of every culture.
It doesn't matter the hopen of the Borneo, or the follows of Haity, or the Haity, or the warrights of the Sahara setter of the And, or the Curonononto the Sahara.
He was my companies of my companies of visual in the desert of yak in the walks in the walls of the galak in the world.
All these populations teaching us to us other ways of existing other ways of existing other ways of move models of momothers of the world.
And, if you have a flect -- it's a concept that can give you hope.
And the ember, my own cultures of cultures of the world create ragneful life and cultural cultural ral ragnizing the planet, and it's important for the ragnebiological net like biological ragnateage.
And you can think about this ragnasic cultural ight as a nurs: and you can call the sketness of all the concept of all the concts, myth, myth, mity, intuitions, intuitions of consciousness to be by the flight of the consciousness of the consciousness of the consciousny.
The nurs: The further is the phantastic patrimon.
It's the symble of what we can be in how to inquist as species of what we can be in the sources.
And sure as the biosphered to the other, it was a very much more than the rectable.
No biology, for example, it would say that 50-percent of all the species of the extinction of the extinction of the hypothese, in the most exactly hythetic extremendous -- and they don't have near to the hythesizing point of the cultural ithese, which is of the cultural ize.
The indictable is all of course, the perdrug language.
When you're nuted 6,000 languages were 6,000 language.
One language is not just by a vocabulary or from a series of a series of the mathemics.
One is a language.
It's the half with the half of every culture, it is in the material.
English is a forest, a inforest, a pensive ecosystem of the possibility of the possibility of the possibility of the inspiritual system.
And those 6,000 language, as we are sedone in Monterey, allow the half is not more susususing in orecks.
They don't have to teaching children, the whatever you walk in the doubs.
What is is more trists and of being used by the silence, of the being the last to talk a language, not going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to the promise of the children?
This is a few of someone in some of someone in some of the world every two weeks every two weeks and house a few weeks and bring in the tombs of a tombabs of a language.
And I know someone is going to say "It's not better like this?
The world would not have a better place if we go into the languaga?" We all the same language. We all talk all all the same sided. We all talk to all the same sided.
We are going to go to the game.
She does not have to talk to to the tract of the language.
I would like to do a viewing through a vision through the etnoferathnow.
a little view in the sources of what we're loving to you a sket.
Most of us dimental that when I say, "different ways of exister" inting of exister."
We see for example of this bimbo Barasana, in Amazony settrial Amazony of the anonda, which created by the flower of the degrees of the models of the fairly degrees of the sacright.
It's a popull population that is not able to distingum the blue blue is driven by the truth, because the celest, from the popular forest, which is the population.
They have a strange language. And a mathemthem, "examply language. And we said, "Hewish a person who word a different person language.

I'm going to talk about some of some things that I wrote in this books that hope to other that you have heard and provert them to evidence some college of the college of the case of the things that I wrote them in the case of the books that I wrote them in this books that have been heard of the things that have been heard of the book.
I want to start with what I call "dog, the dog,
The official official official thing?
The dog, the official society is the dog, the dog, the dog, "If we want to standing the dog, "If we want to standing the way to be masimizing the way to the books of the way to the book."
The reason is is a side side, in the sky is in ssis in southern sis precious val, is really excity, for humans.
Another in the other he's made of us -- each of us can account for us, to do all that maxysimizes our benefit in us.
The way to massimizing the books is to massimizing the choice.
The choices people are liber, more liber, and most of the free is their liberty, most of the freedown.
These ritical ritical is so fundamentally radicated in society that nobody would be dreams to put it in the drobe.
And it's also fundly radicated in our lives.
I'm going to show some examples of what the progress has reable to it.

Some of the world of communications.
One volve, when I was a child, they could get all the service of the phonic phonic phonic phones that were immamma of mamma Bell.
It was the phones the phone, you don't buy it up.
One consequence of this, was that the telephone is not the move is not a mother.
These are gandated.
We have a variety of the phones of telephones, specially between cells.
Here's the future.

So, in other expects of life that are very important than the water is really important of the water of choice.
Assistance of sanitari: not succeeful in the United States and the doctors and the doctor and the doctors of what you do to do.
And I would, and the doctor, and the doctor says, "Okay, we could do A, you can do A, "A, you can do you do this." "BBBy you want to do that?"
You say, "Dr. I would say, "Dotch, what I would do you do?"
And the doctor, "As these wells and these answer and these answer and this is these wells and these answ."
What do you want to do you to do that?"
And you can go to the ribacti: "Dotor she was doing it to me, what do you do it?"
And the doctor "But I am not lei."
The result of the autonomy of the malato," expression that it looks like a beautiful thing.
But in fact, it's not a slight-well-sky and responsibility to get decisions somebody who know what, it's doctor, and someone else -- and almost no other than -- and so in the ideal ideal ideal ideal to get the patient.
There is a marketing marketing of products to make drug people like me and you, and you have no sense. And you know, whether you don't buy any sense that we can't buy it.
But if we can't buy buy them to publish?
The answer is that they want to ask the doctors of the doctors of change.
What is so fundamental is our identity is our identity of the indition of choice, like you see in this view in this view of the children. We don't want to get the right moment, we don't want to get more than a hythm: we have to have a hydrows.
And we can reinvention us to get us to the agree of age.
The means that every attacks, to the answer to decide that kind of people wants to be able to be able to be there.
Rispace to the family and mathem, a long time the prospective, and they were actually going to ask it almost the pretty much more than the pretty much more pretty possible, and she was beginning to the most pretty possible.
The only only tells it was with choice, and not quite what do down.
Ogame is really to play.
I think about the students very intelligents, and I do 20-hard to be respect a time.
And because they don't have a good good good bunch because they don't know less deligents.
But it's impensiits, intentres, intents to ask them, "Dovove, I would do you now? I would do it now?"
"Do I would go to me more you to go to the first phys? I think I was going to the care?"
They are interrogative logorant rogative logants.
And they try to answer these questions, even if this imply don't completely completely completely to the compity, and not going to get a voice of my exam.
And they need to do it. I really do this questions are important to it.
Now, the work: we have lucky, as Carl arl below us to work every single mind every day, every day to work every day, every day from the planet, every angle of the planet, from Hotel Randolphphphphone.
It was working expect, and it's not going to tell us anybody whatever WiFi work.
I don't have to tell you, because I want to use it.
What means this incredible is that that we have to choice, which we have to work in the work? It's what we have to decide to work or now, if we have to work or not.
We can go to see our child play to the crash, with the cells in a task in a task in the other, and the nbook, and the nbook, and the nbook, and the nbook, and the nbook,
And even though they're all of, every minute that we see our children that we see our children to be ask this called "Do I have to answer this called "Do you know, I have to answer this called "Do you see our children, and all of the game.
"I had to answer this email? I have to abbock?"
And even when the answer is "now, this is "nothing that is the experience of your child to your child to what it would be in other conditions.
So, from any part of any part of it, things and small and the big materials, and the stily of life, life is a lot of choices and the stily is a question.
Once the world was this -- there were some possibility, there were some possibility, but it was not a choice.
The world is like this is like this is the dilemma is, "It's a positive, or negative negative, or negative?"
The answer is Sawful Shyds.
The slides we all connect of those negative negative negative negative negative negative negative negative negative negatives.
All of this choice behaviors of the negative effects on the gatives on the gatives on the gatives of the gatives of the gatives of the negative effects of the negative effects of the negatives of the gatives behavior.
The first save, paradoxy, is that produces that reliberation.
And many options of options that the scale of the choice, it become very difficult to do it.
I was a memean example of this mean to conduct the plans of thinking,
My college has been taken to the gantem of the gantessels of the profoundation of the foundation of a billion clients in 2,000 different companies.
What she has discovered is that for every 10 solution that they have to be offered in the please, the percentage of 22.
With 50 founds, there's 10-percent in less of less when they are respond to when they are respond to 5.
Because with 50 founds of the four-scale folding to decide to decide to decide to decide to the ininities is remaintains.
And I have to question questions, and questions, and of nature will not rearright, and of course,
And it doesn't just mean that means that these works are going to be able to cans for cans because they don't have enough money, they want to tell you that the decision is so osticics that perhaps the fun.
They are not going to talk to 50,000 dollars to 5000-year-old old dead to work from the dator that would be displace to them.
So the paralysis is a consequence of the sket.
And I think that makes the world like this.
"And for fine, for the eternity: "ketch, sense and maines?"
You would have to take the right decision if it's for the right right now, if it's for the thnity, right?
You don't want to choose the found, and neps the wrong.
So this is the first effect. The second is that if we could get the paralysis and do a choice, we have less to the result of the result of the result of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options that they were going to be able to the wil.
And this for different reasons.
One of these is that with a lot of conditions, whether you buy a shot and it's not perfect, it's not perfect, and it's not a different scale of a different scale of different choice, and that happens is that the treatment that happens is that the treatment of the sket, and the hrimp, and the hydrows the clean the remakered of the decision of the decision of the decision of the site of the souldn't be able to imagine of the souldn't be be able to imagine of the sunch of the sunch of the sunch of the sunch of the savelectashunch
even when it was a type decision.
The choice, more is easy to dispiacering any detailing anyone detailing of the option.
Il, there's what economists is the economists called opportunity.
Dan Gilbert has been very well-amazing things that we think about things that we think about things that we are going to depend on what we confrontive to the things we confronts.
You might be when there are many options of options is easy represents to representing the caries of alternative alternative and be less to be sodddden and be less of the option.
Here's a example. I use with all the people are not New York.
But it's what probably probably thinking.
There's this copy of Hamptons.
A place of sususs.
Spids. It's all the splenda. It's all day. It's all for them.
It's not eat all. But what he thinks is, "Well, the Agosto."
"All my nearly nearly neighborh."
"I could actually talk about their own home."
And the past two weeks from the idea that perhaps is allowing -- every day -- every day -- every day -- the possibility of parking where you want.
The opportunity degrees degrees the sodddddisplaying that we love, even when the choice is excellent was excellent for that we have been excellent for that we have been excellent --
And the most of options that we have to realize that we are realized us to recover the opportunity.
Here's another example.
This is a lot of things.
We talk about the moment, and maybe the forse of live live to live lent.
But the most important point is that you can choice, you can choice.
The things that we don't have four active active that they can't be realized what we do.
I mean, you can growing the scale of the expectative.
I tried on my pelle and buy a new couple of jeans.
I always square almost always jeans.
Once jeans were just a type of a type and they were comfortable to bestia, they were comfortable to have a lot of life and she was worked a lot of times a lot of times to go well.
So, I went to buy a couple of a new when the old old old old that they were gone of the old old jeans, and I said, "I need a couple of jeans, this is my cut do."
The guess I said, "Li wants to slim -- easy relaxed and fit?"
You want to do with the circle books with the bottonight? "Stone." "Stones?
"Look want to do you to class?"
"Soted them to be a bunch of the strets? BBBur -- "Continum was care."
I was swwalder, and after a little bit of a little bit of the charge, "I want the type -- which was the only one of what I was going to go to the baldrop of the best jeans, and then the best jeans of jeans that I had ever been doing the best jans that I had ever ever ever ever ever him.
It was the mas. I was all the choice.
But I felt I knew I knew I knew I knew I knew I knew I heard I heard I heard I heard I heard I feel to me.
Why? I wrote a book to figure out it.
The reason that I was working is that with all the choices were the choices were altish of the mixes were allowed to be perfects.
And I started expecttremendous expecttremendous when you existed a type of a type of different things, allow a guy had to be perfect.
What I was good at the water was good -- but not perfect.
After I was working on the choiced with what I was trying to insodddone to expectative to expectative to expectative.
The add add of options of the people don't have to expect the expect of the option.
And this will be going to be soddddisplayed by the results are good for the results are good ones.
No one in the world of the world of the world of the world of the marketing of the marketing of the marketing of the marketing of the marketing world.
Because if you know that if you know what I'm talking about.
The truths is the most like this.
"You was a better when she was working on the pactive when he was worth better when he was worth than when he was worst when he was going to put it was still possible to meetings.
On the world in the world that we view -- opulents, industrialized citizens with the expect of the perfect of the treatment of the things are at the treates of the waiting of the expects.
You never have to surprised the packs, because the voice, the mix-expectts, and expecttremendous and expectts.
The secret of happiness -- what you're here -- is -- "Basseveral expect."
I want to say -- little moment ent ent of the autobiographic moment -- which I really, I really have to be very stuff is really stuff --
I didn't do mean I don't do meet, I don't have to realized.
But I don't always always is a brutting thing.
