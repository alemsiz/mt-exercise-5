The year I showed these slide of the next side of the artical artical artica, which for almost three million years has had the size of the 48 States of the 48 percent of the 40 percent.
And this is the suburbs the souch, because it doesn't show it it is the sample.
The climbed crype is in a sense, is in a sense, the climbing system climatic.
And the wind and wind and return back to the expand.
The next next 25 year-old rapid rapid careful carlled on the last 25 years.
The gyacross are signed in red red red red red red in red red red red red red it.
You know, you see the blue skin the blue skin the blue sket.
That's the ice in wind, in the wind, which is the exted.
You can see that the cosid-told yploenn, five years or more, is like the ske, is like the ske, which is like the body.
In 25 years is spent from this, at the time,
This is a problem because the interested in the ocean artor in the ocean artype where there are huge amount of carbon congeled that we want to get it in metanan.
Risped to the totality of the atmosphere, that the atmosphere would be a global squantum of the ske, surprising of not reritor.
In some of the souching the sources in Alaska he's rebolling from water.
The professor, Katey Walter the University of the University is recated with a team -- a team that we have a basive slights.
Video: Wow! Al Gore: Le's good. It's going to be even now.
A motive, this is that this environment to the Genland the Genland the Genland from the north.
This is a glacial regime of glacial glacial.
The door he had never reached to the levels.
This is the Kangerlushed by the Greenland in the Greenland of the Greenland
If you want to know how the sky level to the skin the level of the level of the level of the level the sea mare.
These are increasing increasing rapidly fast.
One part of the planet: Antarts, the largest block of planet.
The month of the scientist have dichiared that the bunches of the ice is in negatioccial negatioccial -- and the Antartomarly line in the equipment, is particularly place in the efloor in the scientist in the efloor.

Here Himalaya, the largest block of glacior -- you see new side of the laghs, who were ice.
The 40 percent of the world's population was going to put the point, the population of the population of the world's population of the world's population of the world's population of the world's population of the world's population of the world's population of the world's population mondi.
Here I was the sliar of the water of the water of this city.
The door is increased.
But when you diminum the same across the water water point.
In California to the Sierra Nevada is diminuth.
The drive by-crisis.
The predictions, like you have a lot of them.
The growing growing in the door a remarkable remarkable news in the door a remarkable news.
The environmental disasters are increasing out of the normal and without previous precedent.
Four times more number of the last 30 years of respect to previous previous previous in the last 30 years
This is a remarkable of all unstanding of the instates.
If you look at the context if you can see the consequence.
In the last five years we added 70 million tons of CO2 hours -- 25 million tons in the oceans every day.
Look at the area of Pacifields, from America in America in America -- in the subststerm, where there is a very poor in the oceans.
Most of global warming, together in the deforestation, and deforestation, which is 20th 20, is the usual use.
The oil is a problem, and the carbon is persh and the carbon is perse.
The United States are one of the most emissions, together with Cina.
And he proponed to build many other centrate of carbon.
But we're doing a change in direction.
These are the projects of annonothing in the last few years and some propositions.
At every time there is a politics in our country.
The carbon and the oil industries have 250 million dollars in the last year for promote the carbon for promote carbon the carbon and the carbon and the carbon and the carbon and the charge of the carbon and the carbon and the carbon and the last year of the carbon and and and the oil of the
And I remember remined me to something,
See Natal Tennese, where we live in Tennesse, there was a 3.8 billion landscape of carbon of carbon of carbon.
Maybe you have seen him to souch.
This is the second largest flew in America.
It's happened around Natal.
The natalized natalized of a carbon was this --
Video: My y ♫ ♫ Frosty is a kind of like and happiness.
It's a sunding here in America, and it's growing our economy.
Frostle is always more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more clean.
It's a precise and workers and workers and workers and keep the stick and hand.
Al Gore: Does here is a part of the West Virginia.
The largest society about the mountain is Massey Coal. This is Massey Coal.
Video: Don Bland, Blankenship: Al Gore, Nancy Pelost Pelolost -- they don't know what they're talking about.
Al Gore: So the Allance for Proteon the Clim has a couple of Clim has to the two nice campaign.
This is a beautiful of it, a party.
Video: Actor: All it see the climatics we see the climate changes like a minm to our business business to our business business to our business.
So our priority is investing a great amount of money in a publishape to make a public heads and confuses the real real and confuses the real real person on carbon.
In fact, the carbon is not sport.
We think it's a good -- it has a good proper.
So I don't precupated, climate change.
Let me do now.
Video: Actor -- you can heard -- you heard about a lot of it.
So we do a gave in a frow structure to the carbon the carbon the carbon the carbon the carbon the carbon the carbon the carbon the carbon the carbon the carbon the carbon the carbon the carbon the carbon the carbon
Straordinary machines are a little rotan, but this is the sound of carbon technology.
The carbon is between the main of the main the main the main the global rescaling technology of carbon the carbon that you see change.
You have a look at the point of the carbon technology.
Al Gore: Infine, the alternative positive to the economic issue and the national sket.
Video: Man: The America, is in crisi; the economy, the national economy, the national economy, climate crisis.
The movie that the whole whole thing of the movie of the beautiful combustic combustic and the oil is and the oil and the oil is and the oil important.
Now, there's a new new audition to usual solution to use circle us.
By America, 100-energy energy, in diectural energy, in diecture.
A plan to put the America to work in the work -- make sure to help the global scale to the global scale of global warming.
Finally, a solution that you have to solve our problems.
Reption. Scopy of it.
Al Gore: This is the ultimes.
Video: I mean, it's about to redate energy in America.
One of the most fastest mostly to the dependence from the becombustic mostly our planet.
I would be here, the future. I mean, a new energy, a new energy remain.
She talks about the investments of working well for places of work works.
I mean, I mean, America. It's time to be realist to be realist --
Al Gore: A old proverbio proverbio you get to the souch, you go to the sun.
If you want to go away and go together."
We need to go away -- fast.
Thank you very much.
The year at TED phececks a introduction on the LHC.
And I promise to return out to get the machine.
So I realized here. And for those who are the other time there is the largest experiment experiment experiment -- 27 7 miles of surround meeting -- 27 miles of circumstom.
His receive to receive the conditions that were less than a second second of the beginning of the universe -- until at 600 million times a second.
All is simply simply environment.
This is the underneath the Gineva.
We have a picture of these mini-Big Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Big Bang Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big in the Big Big Big Big Bang Big Bang Big Big Big Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Big Big Big Big Big Big in in in the Wig Big Bang Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Bang Big Big Bi
This is what I work. It's called ATLAS -- is a 44 feet and has a 21-feet of 2metris.
This is a spaces of spectacular image to build proportion and proportion to build proportion and proportions.
Take 10 settember year we have accesor the first time,
And this picture was taken by ATLAS.
And it because of immense festegy in the head.
It's a picture of the first of particle of particles that he did all the gave of LHC, ring in collision, deliberated, with a part of the LHC, and honding particles in the LHC, and spread.
In other words, when we see that image 10 settember 10 settember that machines works, which is a great life.
I don't know if it was this to do a more opposite to the Google and view it on Google and view it was this in the beginning was this thing.
What means we have a cultural impact of what science science to science what scientific impact to what scientific impact that scientific impact that scientific impact that we had a cultural impact to what scientific impact to what scientific impact to the scientific impact in the scientific impact of what scientific impact
About a week down, there was a problem with the machine, we had to these movies here -- these films.
These movies 13,000 printing when the machine works to the maximum works.
Now, the technical of you look at the movies and say, it's not true. They're not true. They're too much more than you can be too much.
And instead of the surface because when they're very freedoms are going to do it in the surface surfaces.
So, at less 271 degrees, a temperature in the space between the star star star star of the stellow star space between the stellow of the stellow star space between the stellow star star space between the stellow star space between the stellow star star star space between the star star star star of the star star star star of the star star star star star space between the stelles,
In one of the most of the most innovelelements in LHC, there was a fabrication.
So the movies are surrider, and the 13,000 printed printed to meet a resistance of electrice.
This was the result.
Now, this is even more impression, if you think that these magnets fishing the most of 20 tons of about 30 centimeters.
They are danneged about 50 magnets.
We had to take it out.
We have represent and added advanced.
So they're going to return all their place under the ground.
Entrum the end of the LHC will be new inteteen.
Let's accender, and we expect data to get the data or him, and continuing so our wind to discovered to discovered the universe.
Now, of course, in a way of the movie, these starts to reaccendate the value of science and engineering the valuable of science and engineering to confuture. It's easy to configure out of the science and engineering to confident the science of science and engineering the science and engineering of the science and engineering the value of science and engineering the valuable to the science and easy
I think that the fact that it is so hard to go beyond and the light of things like LHC.
I want to conclude with the words of scientist in the Inglese, Humphe, Humphenhouse of his inuses of his inuses of his inuses of his inuseful science was Michael Faay, he was Michael Faay, so much dangerous human beings of human beings in the science of the science of the science of the human ideas that are ideas that are being completely new ideas,
Thank you.
I want to start asking you to rethink about here, to rethink about here, to the kids, play kids,
While you understand how to reach them and reaches them and move them and move them and move them to think and resolving them and eat thinking and hands and eat relationships and relationships and eat relationships and relationships and eat and hands and return them out the springs and easy to think about spres.
The space is propertive to the way we understand the way we understand the world part of the world around us.
So, by information information of our interaction with physics, and my consults, and my consults, and my collaborator Jeevan Kalaniths, and I started asked to ask a computers, and if we use a computers, and if we have a computer-scaling care of a recovers as a computer mountil digital and a hand-hand-hand-hand-scape information with a souch, and a soul,
and we are going to our please?
The question was interesting that I decided to explore the answer, building Siftable.
In point, a Siftable computer is a computer interactive computer in the birth of a birth.
In point, a Siftable computer is a computer interactive computer in the birth of a birth.
You can move with the hands and they can see the movie, and they have a movie, and they have a sherm, and a radio wireless.
But of course, are physics, like the matter objects, as the matter can move simply read to be able to rele-ft.
The Siftable example of a new ecosystem of information system to eat information.
And as a lot of fun, they become more physics, and the other type of the movies, and as a movies, and as the movie, of the movie, of the movie, of how movie, we can exploring new stily new stily stily new stily stily stily stily stily stily and different stily stily stily stily and different stily stily stily stily movies, and and different stily stily stily different than than the movies,
I was going to start some simple example.
This is configured to show the video -- if you including the video -- if you including it in a direction, if you including the other part of the other part of the other part of the other part of the other part of the other part of the other part of the other part of the other part of the other part of the other part of the other part of the other part of the other part of the other part of the other part of the other part of the other part of the other individual backwards.
These riteries are conscious conscious of others.
If they are interested in what they mean it is their intor.
If they come circumstom, and they can agitars a little bit of a pounds.
If they come circumstom, and they can agitars a little bit of a pounds.
They also trum their movement and inclinked and inclinked and incline.
And then we realized that one of the interesting of the interaction was the power to use the communities of data, a color, "versation a liquiet.
In this case, we have three Siftable to configured sects, and I can use them to crashing them in the centry, where they missing them in the centry.
and I can use them to do them in the centry, where they missing them in the centry, where they missing them to be us.
If we can find too much of it, we can put a little bit of place.
These are beautiful opportunity to approach, as the language, and mathematics and gype and gyms where people can try to try things and see the speed of the results.
I'm --
This is a Fibonaction of Fibonacross the equations.
And here we have a play play in Scarabeum and Boggle.
Proratically, every turns out of the house in every Siftable, Proratically, every turns out of every turns out of the Siftable, and while you can go on a house on a diuttases on a dictionary.
Then, after about 30 second remissing a new set of lects, and new possibility to try to try to try to prove it.
Thank you.
Here's the children came to the Middle Lab, I did it and I did it and I realized a video.
They are place in mold mold lot.
And one of the interesting things of this kind of application is that you don't have to give people many instructions.
You know, the word: "Well the words, and they are exactly what do do.
That's what the other people are going to try to do it.
This is our most young head of young in the room.
It was actually wanted to implants.
They only only matter matter --
Now, this is a very interactive application of a interactive cards.
We wanted to build a tool for the approaches of languages is Felix.
It can inserve new person, in the scene, to realize their associated associated ates.
It can inserve new person, in the scene, to realize their associated associated ates.
And it's doing it out the sun.
Video: The sole is source.
David Merrill: One is a treat.
Video: The treat. It's a horrow.
Bel work! S: He's work!
So schooling Siftable and put it up to the neighbors --
Video: Bau!
and inventing their stories.
Video: Cao!
DM: It's a story with the open-end story with the opening as you slights.
DM: It's a story with the open-end story with the opening as you slights.
Video: Vole, I know.
DM: The last example I have the time to show you is a tool, to field and exeply exeply and exeside music.
is a tool, realized by recently, to field music.
The Siftable here is a basis like the basic and the bacteria.
Every one of these has four different variations, and you can choose what use.
And then then you can get these sound in a sequence of the floor.
And modified simply doing a "sound of sound and a "sequence."
These are actually that you can control in the live and the movie.
And they attack a particular sound and then including it.
And then there are the general effects like time and flies in the sequence.
Let's look at how it works.
Video: We will start in two Siftling in two Siftable Siftable Siftable sequence, we get a series, we can get other base.
I put a blood line.
Video: Do you added the percent useful --
Video: I put the movie the movie movie to the effect of the live of live in the live of live in the live of live in the live of live in the bacteria, so I can put the effect of the live of the live movie.
Video: I know about the whole sequence to the whole sequence of the time from a late or the other.
Video: I'm going to add the movie movie to the movie to date more expression.
Video: I think about the sequence to recombind the sequence to the flight to the flight to the flight to the sequence of the flight to the sequence of the flight to the sequence of the time,
So I didn't have to planning the first -- I can try to make it more than the longer or more than the cortouch.
And now, finally, I can get the whole sequence the whole sequence to the left Sift-flight to the Siftable "Ot."
Thank you.
So, you can see my passion is building new interface to build new interface more more like our brain works.
And I had time to show you one of the results of this results, and some possible possibility that we try to bring out of the lab.
The concept I want to transmit you is that is that the new generation of designed objects to interact with the media digital objects in our world in our world world in our world in our world that we want to do.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the now of talk to all of you.
They're a write scrow.
Scare of the books is my profession, but it's more of this is more of this --
It's also the love and the fashim, and the fashion.
And I don't expect that can change it.
But I said this is a particular to be recently in my careera, which he took me to realibring the whole of reports with this work.
The thing is that I recently recently this book, this is called "Mangia, Prule, Ama," Ama," Ama," Ama," for some reason -- for some reason -- for some reason in the world and became a great sensition and become a big sensition of interactional interactional book, and it become a big connectional librings in the world and a great sensition called "Mangia, Prule,
And the result is that everybody away from now, people are like if they were condent as if I was condence.
For -- condence, condence.
They are now all worried and saying, "You don't have to be more to do it?
I don't have to continue to continue to write to go to to create a book that can make a book that can be able to make somebody el?"
that can be important to someone who can you do that?"
It's rashes, you know.
But it could go to worst what I remember 20 years ago, when I was a adolescent people -- I was a adolescent -- I wanted to be a write writice.
I meet against the same reaction of the basied the reaccountry.
And people say, "I don't want to have successful to have successful to have success?
You have to purpose the billion reflies of the refied kills killed kills killed to the refloor that the horse of the reflief of the reflies of the reflies of refit?
You have to do this mestyself to do this mestyself and the mestyself and must be and horiginal heart of a heart of lock energy with the hop of love energy of love fallies of love fallies of love fallies of love the s?"
So, you know.
The answer -- the short answer to all of these questions is, "Se."
I am in all of those things.
I always had to have putting again.
And I also purpose of other things that people don't have to meet it.
As and other things of, and other things of,
But what I was about the write and I asked to write what I thought and ask it is why it?
Is it?
It's logical that anyone who has to be expected by a work that I was spread to do it.
But what is so particular in the pretty creative to make it realize the mind of the mind reality in a way that other characters in a way that other characters don't have to be a fanno?
How my father, for example, he was a engineing and I remember one time in his 40 years of activity in his 40 years of activity that was asked to be engineing to be engineing to be engineing to be engineer?
It was never -- that block of the engineing John, how you do you do it?
It didn't work?
Onestly, the engineers are not suddenly in the selight selies, in the reputation of being alcolized to be alcolized by maniuurights.
We writers, we have this repute; we have this reputtation of every generative generation of every general reputation of being enormous to be enormous instable.
And it's not rest that look at the triste of the magnities of the magnities of the magnition of the magnition of the wind of the people and often hor.
And the people who don't have to be really, seem to be recognized by their women.
Norman Mailer, before I was in the last view of the interviewed a popoor a poor more. Ogni is a poor more. One of the work of the work of their life.
But we don't have the way to be when we heard of these things that are very long-like like a long way we completely interiorized and accepted the nation that creativity and softor, and the sofloor in some way to the anangood, and the artest art, and the art of angoodddam.
And the question I want to take all of the today is what is to do we agree with this ideas?
It comes to the well of this -- because it looks like a centimeter of distance to me not to be good for anything that supposed to this supposed to do anything that supposed to be a centimeter of this --
I think it's good;
And I think it's dangerous and I don't want to see the perpetuated in the next secolor of the next secolor and I think it's dangered in the next secur.
I think it's better incorporate our great minds creative minds creative forward.
And I know that in my case -- in my house -- it would be very dangerous to be able to be able to supposed to support the circumstances in my careers.
Obbasis, I look at the day, I was like 40 years.
I still about four decade works.
And it's very likely to write what I write is going to be saying from the world as work that I was going to be able to be able to be going to happened by my last book.
And I'm going to ske, because we are all more or friends here -- it's probably the most of my biggest movies.
Oh, Gese, you know, you think of hero!
You know, this is the kind of though I think that bring a person to start to get the bad of the mattina and I don't want to do it.
I would continue to do this work that we do this work that we do.
So, the question become and become to become and become to the question of the question become to the question become to the question of the question become to the question become it?
And so I was a lot of reflessions, which is to work to work to work to keep write is to create a psychological copsychological copsychology psychology of reflects, and so that we can get to work to work to work to work to work to work to work to work to work to work to work a psychology psychology of the psychological copsychology of the psychological psychological copsychology psychology psychological copsychological psych
I have to find a distance of security between me, which I'm writing to be write to be write to the scored poor to get E, and I was trying to get the next year to the next year to look through the time, trying to look through the time, trying to find other society to see if they could have the other ideas to have ideas to be ideas and more santhety ides and the most santh.
how to help people creative to do people in the inerents of creativity.
And that research has taken to the Grecie and Roma.
Seguitems because I was in certain and then back back to the hundred th.
In the antics and the amount and Roma -- people don't look at the creativity came to the creativity came to the man, OK?
It was thinking that the creativity was a few of became out of a few surprising of a few distant distant distant and sun, to reach and connected to reach and consciously consciousness and consciously reaching and spread and sun.
The creatives called these bespirits of creativity of creativity creativity "demonies.
Socrate, wonderful of really, I believe to have a demone that elarged by the long.
The Romans were the same idea, but they call that the kind of spirit a genie.
The great is that great because Romans they didn't think that a parently that a parently smart.
They have to be a genius was this kind of kind of inities that created in the walls of the study of a artist, a little bit like elf, a little bit like elpho, and modeling out of the artist's work of the work of the work of the work of the work of work and modeling of that work work.
Exity, that is the distance of which is the distance of what the psychological psychological psychological psychology of your works.
And all the knew that was so that it working, right?
So the artists were protypes were protected, as for example, now, now?
If your work was exception, you could take all the market, all the market, all the market, all of the market, all of this genue.
If your work is not the cool, it was not all of the coptue, right?
And all of the same that was your genius to be a incapace.
And so people are concept the creativity in Ockcycle for a long time.
And then Rincome and all changed and all changed this great idea, and all of this idea, and we put the midle of the universe to the midle of the universe and not left space to creature creature that they write detailed by the divinity.
This was the ration, the road of the rational human and people start thinking that creativity came out of the ishare of the ishare of the ishare of the ishare it.
And for the first time in history, you get this to referred this or that artist is like a genurage to a person with genie.
And I have to tell you that was a big error.
I think that allowed to somebody -- a simple person to create a recipes like a recipes and the surprising of all the misteries and surprises and the ethird-half a mountain a movie mountain the fragile of the fragile of human beings.
It's like to ask someone of enginoid to the money.
And he distores and history and creates all these ingestible expectations on performance.
And I think it was this pression to have the artists in the past,
And, if this is true, and I think that it is the question, and ore?
Can we do it different?
Mantum to a more experience understanding of the relationship between human relationship.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we can cancelling 500 years of rational thinking about a rational 18 minutes.
And you probably have people in the audience that solled to the scientific nuttypes on the notion of the non-further fashion, and they have the succeed of their projects.
I probably don't know all about this things.
But the question I want to ask is -- why we do it?
Why don't think about this way?
Because it has more sense of every thing that has ever heard to explain exasive exasibility of process of creativity.
A process that you have ever done that you have ever done to do something -- so foundly, all here -- you know, you don't understand ration.
And, you can seem completely seem to seem completely paranorm.
I did this meeting with the extraordinary extraordinary poet, who has 90 years, but that was 90 years, but it was a poet, and he said his life and he said his childhood and I was working out in the field, and I was spoet, and I was a poety in the walk, and I was the poet, when a poety exact of the country.
I told that was like a rerageous phone of the air.
And that was coming roton to the lei of the country.
And he heard the below his place to get the land the below his place the place of his pids.
It was to have a sole thing to do to that point and he was -- he was going to say, "corrupt how a matta."
And he recording to the house and he was inseced by this poet, and it would have to make a piece of paper and a mathemates and a mathemates and a mathem, and a drops and the pay and the paying page.
And sometimes I couldn't be fastony quickly, so he was going to get and recorree and the poetry and the poety and the poeter rotate roll and the left and she would continued to roten through the rotold roll through the roten and he was continued to roten a few of the other poeta."
And then there were those -- this piece -- this piece of -- this piece of -- there were any perdent at the time was almost perdend, OK?
So, he was running and he was trying to go and was trying to card and the poet, and he was going to go through the other and then he was going to go and then he said, and then he said, that he was like to get the other and the hand and the offered and the off.
And he was a poeter from the cover and the touch, and the transaction and the transaction was the page.
And in these cases, the poety would be presented on the perfect pain and inted the last word to the first word to the first word to the first word to the first side of the first word to the first sit word to the first side of the first word to the first side and intact paper and inted the last word and I met the last word of the last word to the first word to the first skin the earth.
So when I think -- it's exactly exactly exactly the process of the creatis;
I don't have all my creative process -- I don't have a condddutture.
I'm a mule, and my way to work and my way to work and go go back to the same horary every day and go go and go to and go through and go to the past.
But I even even in my head and I met against that thing, I was a flight against that --
And I image many of you have a lot of you of you have the han face.
You know, if the work and ideas and ideas and ideas I was going to be able to be able to extly source.
And what this is what this is it?
And how can we relate to do it in the head to do the head and stop us to remap, that we do it?
And I was reduced the best example, example, I have the musician Tom Waits, which I interviewed different day.
We were talking about this and you know, Tom, you know, Tom, and the major life was the incarnation of the artist of the totype of control, dominating these species of creatives to creatives that interior creative interiorized.
But then I was going to get it to the one day -- and a day day when he was driving on the un-hundred to Los Angeles, changed all of him.
It was going to go fast and all of a skin this little broken this little broken as the inspiration, elusive and the sun, and the wants and the wants and the wants and the desire and the desig, you know, it's won't know how to take it out, but it doesn't know how to take it out.
It has no piece of cards, it has no mathematic, it has no registrator.
So I started heard this kind of old old old this kind of old old is growing in him, and I would take it to the hossessioned by this song.
I don't have good enough and I can't do it and I can't do it --
And instead of go to the panic stop --
And I'm going to go the whole process and foundly again.
And he just just the sky and said, "Scuse, and he said, "Scus, I don't see that I'm dy?"
"To seems that can write a song?
If it really want to exist, in a moment when I can take a crazy when I can take care of you.
Other than anyone other today.
You have to disturbing Leonard Cohen."
And his process working changed after that.
It doesn't work was still working as a pretty much as the work,
But the process, and the fish is that I was going to releave when the genie, the genius was that he was going to be about the other than the other thing that was happening and remaking it from the other thing that he was a whole thing to be a whole thing thing that he was a interior.
but it was a conversation between Tom and wonderful conversation between Tom and the exert of Tom and exert that he was not Tom.
So what I was heard that I was going to change a little bit bit the way I was working and I was a timing of a time, and I was going to save a times.
This idea, I save when I was writing "Mangia, Prula, Prule, and he good-in a few of the hundred of the disperation of the disperation of something and we can start thinking that a desays, and I started to think that a pigggame, which is going to be the worst of the books.
It doesn't just but, just the worst book written write.
And I started thinking about design.
But then I remembers to me working at the air, and try to get us to the air.
So I went to my face in the hands and I would say, "I realized my bements to a roangle in room.
And I said to the other, "You know, what this book is not going to be brilliant book not be brilliant to be brilliant not be brilliant to be a copym, right?
Because how I see what I am am doing all that ho, I don't have the one of that.
So if you want to present, you have to presentt and do your parts.
Okay. But if you don't know what I mean, I don't know anything thing about anything nothing.
I'm going to write the same because it's my work.
And I would want to do that was recorded that I today I today I today I today I was -- at the end is -- in the deserts of Africa in the deserts of Africa in the deserts of the Africa of the mountain the dances of the mountain the mountain and mountil to the be.
And they were always magnific because the ballers, they were professional and they were fantastic.
But every top, of course, something happen, and one of these artists become to reality translent transendent transend.
And I know what I know about what I know the one of the one of the point, a performance of the point, a performance that.
It was like the time you stop, and the baller's walking through a half a kind of cars and he was doing nothing of different from the solit, but all the sun, but all of the suneava.
And of suddenly as a human being.
But you get to the beautiful and under the beautiful divinity.
And when this happen, I was going to have to know what he was called his now.
They were going to crype and they started cant, "Ah, Dod God, God, God, God, God, God,
That's God, you know.
Sput, at the story -- when Moreaser Morinvaded the sound of Spna, and the print of their own and print in the seco-century changed in the secourage "Oole, you can hear in the floor in the flot of the friend.
In Spay, when a artist has been something impossible and magic -- Oh, oh, oh, oh, magnific -- -- a shot -- a shortle, and a short-hor.
And it's great because we have needs.
But the next day the day down, the next day down, when you slight and discovers and discovers that are the 11 of Marteds and the skets is not young more.
It's just a death, with the original grab to the house to the house to the house to the alteen.
And perhaps no one will be the Dod of the Dod is a rest of his life?
It's hard to hard it.
This is one of the most of the most dolors to do in a creativity to make a creatiss.
But maybe it doesn't have to be so angoodddrop to be so anisn't believe, that the most extraordinary extraordinary to be coming from you to you have come from you to you,
But I believe that simply you get to be data in prested by a inimaginable of this squisite of your life that you have to go to someone else when you go back to someone else when you go back to someone else when you go to someone when you go to somebody else when you go to somebody else when you go to somebody else when you go to the squist of the squis
And, you know, if we think in this way all change.
And so I started thinking about different months in the day and it's sure I thought to different months in the work of book that public book that public book -- exactly ext of my great deal of my great deal of my great deal of my great deal to my great deal with my great deal with my great deal with my great degree of my great deal with the books.
And that I have to continue when I feel feeling when I feel electsets of this is --
I don't have to do it. It just your works.
It took to presents to presents your party, any of any can be down.
If your work is ball, you know, ball, ball.
If the became out of the kind of wonderful as a tough to leave some kind of wonderful kind of wonderful time through your shapes of your shape forces, then "Ole!"
Other than you have the same your dance.
And "Ole!" to you know, you know.
I think and I think and I think it debed to teach it.
"Ole!" to you, just to get the hopefully and head and head and head and head to do you keep keep the continuing to represent.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
And as I know about some of these projects on the genome of the genome of the genome of genome of genomes.
So we're starting a new lost of the biology and now we started to digitalizing biology and now to that code and now in a new fashion, and design synthetic, designing and synthetizing lives.
We always tried to take big questions.
"What is the life, is something that many biology to understand how many level, and the various levels.
We tried to be different approach, reduced the minimes.
We're digitalizing from almost 20 years ago.
When we sequenced the genome of the world was a movie of the world world of biology to the world digital world of computer.
So we ask us to regenerate the life, or create new life from this universe to this universe and digit?
This is the maps of a little organism, Mycoplasm genitalium, which is the small kind of the genome of the genome of those who can autoreplasure in the laboratory.
And we tried to reduce the genome of the genome to create a little bit more smaller than the little bit more smaller than it.
We are able to eliminating a centina-hundred genes of about 500 that are here.
But when we look at the now, his maps to his maps to the now.
Here's simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can do a time, is very improbably that this can bring a cell cell.
So we decided to progrese the only one to progrese this is to sintety-way way to move this cromosome, to make some of these questions.
And so we started the wind of "Plean to the "Plean mother?"
What is the constent is to create these big molecules that we never can create the first of the hor?
And, in case of them, we can make a cromosomain?
A cromosome, it's simply a piece of inertotype inerts.
The speed with the speed that we are able to digitalize life is growing exponential exponential exponential exponential.
Our capacity to write the genetic code of genetic code of the kind of slowly, but it's better than that.
And our most results, the door the door exponential care exponential.
We started 15 years ago.
The process has requietic review of puttagages, starting to the first experiments.
But we discovered that DNA is very difficult to DNA is very difficult.
There are decade of the machines of cars in the world that are going to have a 30 of DNA moons of 30 to 50 lecture and is a degenerative process is a degenerative process is a long longer to be a long longer and it's a long long error sand is a decar to 30 to the move of the machines.
So we have to develop a new metom to assembling these frams and correst the herrors.
And this was our first tent, in the first tent, the digital information of Phi Can 174.
It's a little virus that kills killed food.
We designed the frames, effectuated the recorrection of the errors and get a lot of of of of about 5,000 letters.
The interesting part is when we took this piece of inertit and we insert in the bacteria and we insert this genetic code and producing this genetic code and producing the particle of viral.
The particle is then then they were released by cellules, are back to the cells, and they have distrop the Ecoveryse.
I talked about recently recently the oil industry was saying that they are certainly comprepretty this model.
They have more than you.
We think this is a situation where the software can build its hardware in a biological system in a biological system in a biological system in a biological system in a biological system that the same software can actually build its hardware to build its hardware in a biology system in a biology.
But we wanted to do things in big things in big things in big things in big things in big things.
We wanted to build the whole cromosometimes of the bacteria.
They're more than 580 miles of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code.
So we thought of building this in cassets of virus, so that we can change the cassets to understand any class of a cell.
The design is crucial design, and if we start with information information in a computer, these have to be very accurate to be very accurate to be very accurate information in a computers.
When we sequence, this genome for the first time in 1995 accuratem was a error, was a herror,
We found out of the game, 30 errors. If we were used that sequence to do this experience.
One part of the process is designing to design set to the 50 letting of the 50 lects of 50 lects of 50 lects of 50 lects of the lecture of the most small than working together.
We put a lot of the only one of the only here.
You probably have a read that we read the phylibring of the phylie.
Think of the thing: we have a genetic code on four liter: A, C, C, C, C, C, and T.
Three of those lects together codified with about 20 friends of the love, and there's a specific specific re-horder of the load.
So we can use the genetic code for write words, fraise --
What we did in the beginning is autography.
Some of the fact that was not a poethese.
We designed these segments for simply unique and the universe with the very simply unique and the way to the universe with the poors.
There are improving them and put them and put them and put them out and put them out of it.
And we started to assembling the parts, starting to five to five to five to seven the letter lands, undress of 24 miles of 24 miles the lecter lecture of the letter lands.
And every step we produced these sequence sequence in the samples so we can make a procept that we're telling a procept of creating a procept -- how to see in a minute.
We're trying to automatizing the process.
So, this seems the tabellon young playyycycycycycycle of basket.
When we go to these segments very long-well, more than 100 miles of 100 miles in Ecoverything in Ecoverything in Ecoveryyet.
It's going to go to the tools of the tools of the molecular tools.
So we consider other monthecture.
We knew about another meccanism called recombination called recombination of biology, which in biology to repeak the segments.
Here's a example.
This organism, called Deinococcus radioddary three million radioddgen three million radiation.
You can see in the requeef as his cromosometimes came to the dromosome.
In 12 hours is reassembled as was the first --
They were thousands of organisms that I was able to do it.
These organisms can set completely.
They can live under the touch.
They're absolutely sure life in space and exists to find new environments to find new environments of water.
In fact, the NASA showed that this aven.
This is a picture of molecules that we built these process, simply using the design approaches of the design approached design approached by inserious design approach.
The lievit of the assembly the automatically lievidence of the automatically lieview them.
This image is not been taken with a microscope electronic microscope with a microscope srule.
It's a lot of a great molecular molecules that we can see the slight?
These are pictures a period, of about six seconds.
This is the published that we did a time ago.
They're more than 58,000 letting code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic.
It's the largest molecules of a structure that I created by the man.
It has a lot of fish molecular perior 300 billion hundred pounds.
If we go passiside with a cararacter to 10 ppage 10 pages to only transck this genetic code this genetic code this genetic code this genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic.
Now, how do we do it work? How can we active it work?
Of course, we try, a virus is a play play play from the girls.
It's a little bit more complicated when you use the bacteria of the bacteria
It's just as a simply cell as our euclear cells. You can simply extent the nuclear clong, and insert a other, which is practice the process of clon.
In the bacteria araea mosometime is integrated in the cells, but we recently have recently demonstrate that we are able to do a trapile of a cromosometimes a cromosometimes from a cromosometimes and active it and active it.
We can refed a mosometimes a kind of a kind of microbial species
The two different are different than the touches of the topies.
We added some genes in a more way to decide what to choose to this cromother.
And then science to the science in the science way to killing all the protects.
And when we put in the cell is the floor is the floor, you know, our graphicate soffloor is the new cromosome, the new mosome.
And we thought we were thought we couldn't go go to the more of, but we tried to spects, we tried to be able to spects.
This is one of the most mechanisms of evolution.
We discovered that tanded species have added a second or a second horse of some parents, advanced by some of new tracross the type of new tracks.
So who think about evolution as a gene of the gene time you get a modiphics that modified part of the biology.
They were symployees called "restrial restription is that addictions are the DNA DNA DNA
The cromosome that was in the cell cell as a cell as a cell as a hand.
The cell cromosomes that we have inserito-ha.
It's expressed and recognized the other cromosome, as a material as material -- and we recognized with only cell and the new cromother.
became blue of genes that we mean that we meet.
And in a short of time, all the carries of a kind of a species are allowed by the new species, and it's transformed in a new software in the new software that we insert in cell.
All the protein change, the protein change, and when we go out and when we go to the genetic code of what we transferited.
Now, this could seem to look at the genetic software to the software we going to be sustained enough.
Now, I exployees here is not parking the genes of genespecially from three million years of evolution, and a half of evolution, and I said that maybe we're going to create a new version of Cambriana where they are created new species in this process of this process on this process of this process of this process on this process of the gital process of the gital process of the genes of the gital species of years and a new version of the
Why do we do that?
I think it's enough obvious when we think about our needs.
We're going to spend six billion and a half million people in the next 40 years.
And I was to give an example, I was borned in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for tool in 1946; in 40 years, in 40 years,
We're going to find the food, and a house and clear floor and a half million of people, and a half half million people.
It will still do it for us.
And we live more than five billion carbon of carbon of bars.
What is cent cutes of bars at the day.
When we try to find biological process, or any kind of process to remain a challenges to remains a challenge.
We have to get a lot of of of the CO2 from these materials that finishes in the atmosphere.
At day, thank you to the scientific discovered scientific sket, we have a data databasased with about 20 million genes, and I like to think that components components for the future.
The electronic industry is only one dozen about components, and think about how many different things are coming out.
Our are the main in the main reality and our imagination.
So we have technical technical methodd-rapid-synthetics, to create what we call genomics.
We're able to build a big robot that can produce a crobots that can produce a day.
Think of processing these 20 million different genes of genes or to prove the processes to prove processes or drugs, new vaccines, and a little tee and more biology they, and create more biology than the last 20 years of science.
And it's just a standard.
We can choose to survival for the survive of survive survivalue, produption or of vaccines of vaccets.
This is a few software some software programmed to be able to be able to seeing species to be able to set us to the computer.
Well, we don't know necessarily how they be year.
We know how their genetic code in their genetic code code in their genetic code code.
So we're concentrating the carbon of how arounds.
You also seen you see you that you experiment from the grand experiment was a windows.
We have carbon and third generation that are going to be pretty double enough to carbon the most valuable to carbon or different kinds of butanol.
But the only way that biology can have a great impact to have a great impact to the coest and limited the coest of the food and limited the CO2 in the primal material in the primal materials that we're working for the mobile cells that can reach this discovered -- and we think of the first few of how we could do this before -- we think of the first 18 months in about 18 months.
The sunlight with the CO2 is a metodom, we find out in our discovered in the world, we found different metodi.
This is a organism that we have described in 1996.
See in the ocean propertime-foundly, about 2500 feet of ebolliance of water.
It methanane from CO2 using a molecular power like the energy.
We're trying to understand if we can actually actually actually make the CO2, which can be transported to be transported to be transported to drive this process.
So that short we think we could be able to play what the question is Not, "What is the life, "What is Noy, trum is Noy, nice -- we have the modest of remains of remains the entire industry.
Exactly if you can't do it from TED, where you can do it from TED, where you can do it?
It would be a main the source of energy.
Inol, we're working for creating the same meto-half vaccines to create vaccines
You have seen this year with influence, we are always independent in a year and a dollar, when it's a basic and the right right right now.
I think that what you can change in the vaccinable to change vaccinable in anticipate vaccinable to change in ant.
That's how the future could start seem to seem to change it, the evolution, and evolution, accelerating evolution with the bacteria and infinally infinally infinally cells.
We are so so the best people.
Our the purpose is to live enough to try to do it. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
I will do all you want to see the most rapidly possible work in the new technology that we bring to Microsoft in the Microsoft in the Microsoft in the midle of a year ago in the slights. This is Seadragon.
It's a enormous environment where you can interact with an enormous amount of data visible data with a huge amount of data visual data in the local level of viside.
And we are seeing molties of gabyte pho-gabyte cle and continue, and continue to a speed of the sket, to make the images like this.
And it doesn't matter how big information information that we see the great information of these data data or the images.
Most are communicated photographs -- but this is a provision of the Congres-scansion, and revenient of Congres-in the gam, and reent, and reent, and return out of 300 megapixel.
It doesn't do any difference because the only thing that limbs are the prestations of a system like this is the number of pattern. It's also a very flexible architecture of it. It's also a very flexible architecture that is a very flexible architecture of a system like this is also a very fle-ft.
This is a book inter, example, example, for example,
This is Casa desolated desolated of Dickens. Ogni colon-represents a capit."
And to show you that is about the head and not images, we can do a thing thing of the representation of the representation of a representation of a representation of a representation of a photo.
It could be a little artificial way to read a book electronic book electronic book electronic book a electronic book electronic.
It doesn't be a children.
This is a more realist example, is a number of a number of Guardian.
Every image is the beginning of a section.
And it will be the pleasure and the beauty experience of a read read version of a view of a view or a lot of a lot of half a lot of meet.
We also did something with the angle of this number of this number of Guardian.
We created a published phasulla fasulla higher resolution -- very more than that you use in a normal published in the country -- and we insert of the content of the content of the content of the content of the content of the content of the content of the content of the content to the countries.
If you want to see the carns of this carnon-carried cars.
Or other models, or even the specific specific specific specific and the specific specific specific models, or perhaps in the models, or even the other models, or even the other models, or even the other sket.
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the screens of space on the screen.
We hope that this means to put pop and other port and other port of the other points and other port is necessarily to be necessary.
Of course, the maps is one of the most obvious applications and for this kind of technologies.
And I don't want to lose the time, if we don't mean that we have to say to the sket.
These are all the streets in the U.S. sobject in the SA pictual image of NASA.
So now we go to something,
This is actually the webskin the websk; you can go to see it at the webse.
It's a project called Photosynth, which combine two different technologies.
One is Seadragonon and the other is a visual research in the University of the University of the University of Washington, with the Selish Selisz of the U.S. Seliski Selisky Rick Seliski Rick Selish in the U.S.
And it's from the web, I went to Seadragon.
You can see when we do this screen of screen to the screen to the other image of the kind of experience resolution to solution resolution to resolution and have this kind of multimately resolution when we do this screen kind of screen to the screen of screen and have this kind of screen of screen and have this kind of experience.
But the collocast, the images here has actually a meaning in this is a meaning.
The realgorithms of visualization of the computer have regists together in the real-to-to-to-real-to-shared ctouching up to the side of the Montages of the Montagages -- you have to be slide-show-slide-like slights. Any things are all of the things are all college of these things are all college links are all college.
I don't know if I have time to show you some other environment.
And there are some more spaces.
I want to spend directly to one of the original set of Noah. And this is a previous precedent protynthosynynthese, which we did working, to show you what we did to work for the first time is really the ask technology, this technology, Photynthosynthosynthip of the Enthosynthese. And it's not necessarily to look at the web.
We have to worry about the legal ways.
This is a rebuilding in the type of Notis to be a slide of Flickrlickr. Basta Flickly. Bast, and you get a maps of types and you get a maps and saying that you can be appears and saying that is discovered to this model, and you can discovered this model.
So I have all the images of Flickr and are all college in this way.
And it's possible to be able to have this simple way.
You know, I would never think I was going to finished to work for Microsoft.
It's very gratifiction to receiving this kind of accool accool here.
I think you can see that it's a lot of different types of different kinds of fotos of those cellular cells to those cellular cells. SLR, a number of SLR, a number of thing, in this environment.
And if you can try to try to try to try to try to get those strange.
Many are blocks, exctarras, etc.
She is a series of photographs -- exactly a series of photographs.
This is a Noty-Dris in Notyet.
We can spend from the places to the view of this environment.
The essential point is that we can do things with the social things with the social connected from all of the internal connection of how to appears the land of view -- and college all of those data together.
All of those pictures become together, most of the same.
You have a model of the land that emerge.
Think about this as a long mountain Stephen Lawler on Earth.
It's something that grows in complexity to grow people who use the people who uses to be using for who uses to the us.
Their pictures with meters of other people.
If someone is the idea of the idea of the conduct of all these skins saying the name of Notech, the Noth Dame Desesished of all those dates, and the ddata, and the sky of the enginresing in in the space of the type of the type and have a experience of the type of the type of the type type of the type cross the type of the kind of sket-ss.
In the extremely consequence of all of the most extremely elaborated every part of the earth, you don't just sold money and plane and plane and plane and side-plane plane and million, but the memory of the collective memories and million.
Mille of thank you.
Can is Anderson: I understand what your software we going to do is that a little bit of doing is that a certain the next few years ago, all the photographs are share on the whole photogras that anyone in the world will be practiced together?
BA: Yeah. What is doing in practice is to discover.
It's creating creating hyperlink, if you want to be in images.
And it's doing it in the base of the images.
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about information information of information that many of these images of these images of these images of these images of the images of these images of informformation images of informformation information of information information of information information information of these images.
How do you have a research of images on the web, and the head and the head has a lot of information about the web images of the pictures of the pictures of the picture.
Now, what happens if that pictures up all the vostages of the picture?
So the amount of interconnection and the amount of reckets that is really enormous amount of retype of the retasy of the retas.
CA: Blaise, is really incredible. I mean,
BA: You want to thank you very much.
One of the principle when you travel and one of the research of research is the power between who has no anti-dementically the anti-form live in the place of the past, the pasts of the place plants in the place of plants.
Bast, the way we think of science Jaguar is still the Viijics still the Lattea, or that myth, or that the Mananaya, the good of means that in Himalaya, the budddges the world is still the major the world is still the world that the world we live in the world that we live in the world in which we live in the world that we live to exists in the world in the world in Himalaas, but it's just a movie,
the consequence of a particular choices that our irstirps of the stirps of generations.
And, of course, we all share of the essential tracts.
We all all of the procreished. We all procreid.
We are subjects.
We have to do the inexority of mortaren't surprised and ballies --
We have a art.
What we have colate is the right right right right to the dog of every culture.
It doesn't matter the Gan Ean forests of the forests of the Voodoor of Haiti, or the Haiti, or the Haiti, or the Kenya settrial camel, Curerers, Curerers, Curerer's heard of Sahara.
He was my own company in the desert of view in the desert of the hyak in the walls of the Sommayak in the world.
All of these populations teaches that are other ways of existing other ways of thinking, other ways of thinking of movies in the world.
And, if you get a atat, it's a concept that can give you hope.
And in the mirid-cultures of the world create of life spiritual life spiritual and cultural planet and is important for the planet and is important for the planet and it's important for the planet as the planet as the ragnatela as biosphiped as biosphphipits.
And you can think about this ragnatela cultural action as a hetnos; you can defined the total remarkable of all the concept of all the concept of all the conceptions, ideas, inspiration, intuities in the beginning of the consciousness of the consciousness of the consciousness of the consciousness of the concept of the concept of the concept of all the concept of the concept of the concept of all the conce
The floor is the fantastic patrimoney.
It's the symbuly of what we can be in the kind of what we can be as a species of what we can be as a inquisise.
And sure as the biosphere was graving to the otherwise is happened to the ethnos; it was very more rapidly rawer and purch.
No biology, for example, for example, for all the species is or on the horse of the extinction -- in the most adpoor -- in the most adpoorest of the biological diversity -- in the most advances -- and you have no near to the most of the different money in the most of cultural imisticultural ight-pounds.
The indication of all is, of course, the perddata language.
When you were borns in the planet.
One language is not just from a vocabolary or a series of rules or a series of rules.
And the language is the side of the human spirit of human spirit human spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit language.
It's the meeting of the culture of every culture.
Every language is a forest forest, a forest system of the ine, a system of the possibility system.
And those 6,000 language in the half of the side of the hallow half the half of the hallow children.
They don't have more teached to children, which is not walked to the bely, who are dead.
What is more tristes of being availed by the silence, of the last few of the skin the test engine, of the saves of the avoid of the aves of the hands of the kids?
This is a few weeks, one in some of someone in some of the world every two weeks a lot of a mountain and bring is in the tombs and bring up in the tombs of a language.
And I know someone who will tell you that someone is not better than that?
The world would be a better place if we go to all the same language in the same language?" And we are all around all of the horuba. We are all works.
We talk about the skogi.
She realized a tract thing that you want to talk about their language.
I want to do a view through the etniferathetnois:

The answer is She's She's Shydropped in She's Shyth.
The slides we know all of the negatives to the negativiews.
And all this is a lot of effects of the negatives on the gent.
The first -- the first -- it's producing works, is that producing freedom,
With options the floor of the scees, become very difficult to do it.
I offer a mean an example, a study conducted plans of thinking of thinking.
And my college has been access to the data of Vaneasy competities of thought-hand-hand-hors of clients in 2,000 different companies.
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are going to have to offert in the morning of adescenes of the 22.
With 50 founds, there's 100 percent in less of the adesions when they are available to the 5. Why?
Because with 50 foundation of the foundation, is diease, is dieaseily to the inquestion is remaking to questions.
And the question and I asked questions, and of course, questions, and of course, and of course,
You know, that this is not only that these workers who are going to be able to cancers for cancers because they are not going to say that the decision is so that the decision is so ostics that the decision is so ostick of complex works.
And not a lot of working, are allowing to 50,000 dollars to work from the dator of work, which would be displace to crashed to the drive of the data of works.
So the paralysis is a consequence of the have too much of the choice.
And I think that makes the world like this.
"And finally, for the eternity: "eeternity: "Where are you --
You know, you take the decision to take the decision is the right of the eternity, right?
You don't want to choose the source wrong and the wrong condition.
So this is the first effect. The second is that if we could evitself the paralsy and do a choice, we end up to the result of how we would be able to be with less options to be with less options what's going to be with less open.
And this for different reasons.
One of those is that with a lot of of the scees, if you buy a and it's not perfect, and it's easy to imagine that you would have a choice, and that would be better than would be better than it would be better than it would be better than it was a lot of a choice, and the remain and the skin the decision of the decision of the decision of the decision of the decision of the decision of the decision of the decision of the decision of the decision of the decision
even when it was an optimidddle decision.
And the choices that are easy to be easy to any any details that it's insoftwice of the option.
Inol, there's what economist economist called opportunity.
Dan Gilbert has asked a lot of well as the value that we think about things that we are depended to what we confrontive to the confronties.
In the options are so many options of options, is easy to represent the careful characteristics of the options of options that is choices of options that is choice.
Here's an example. And I spoke with all of the New York.

The opportunity of diminisces the sodddddiscovered to that that we have been excellent was excellent was excellent was excellent for the sket.
And the most of the options we have to consider the careages that are going to recovered to recover-opportunity.
Here's another example.
This is a lot of things.
And it is the live of the live of live live to live live to live live to live the moment.
But the most important is that any thing is that any thing you can get the others.
The things that we don't have a lot of four active active things we do it.

It was the sym. I was the chop of the chop of the broke.
But I heard I knew it.
Why? I wrote a book to understand it.
The reason I was worst worst is that with all the choices were expectations were altis; jeans had to be perfects.
And I started expectations -- I didn't expectinct anything about when you existed a type of 100 different type of 100 different kind of different kind of a type of a kind of a kind of a type that I was expected.
What I was watched was good -- but it doesn't perfect.
After I was working with what I was trying to choice, I was trying to confronted in confronfront of it.
The add of options in life of the people don't have to respectactive to expectations of options.
