<unk> year, I showed these <unk> to <unk> that the <unk> <unk> <unk>, which for almost three million years had the size of the United States <unk>, is <unk> <unk> of 40 percent.
I'm going to <unk> this problem because it doesn't show the ice <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> is, in a certain sense, the heart of the <unk> of the global system.
It's <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
The next <unk> will be a <unk> <unk> <unk> on the last 25 years.
<unk> <unk> are <unk> in red.
You see, you're <unk> up to the blue <unk>.
That's the ice in <unk>, that's <unk> summer.
You can see that the <unk> ice <unk>, of five years, it's like the blood, that's the blood here,
It's been in 25 years, so.
This is a problem because the <unk> <unk> the <unk> ground around the ocean, where there are huge <unk> of <unk> <unk> that, <unk>, <unk>, are being <unk> into <unk> <unk>.
<unk> to the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, that amount could be <unk>, that amount of <unk> could be <unk>, and that <unk> would not be <unk>.
In some <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> is already <unk> by the water.
The <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> was <unk> with a <unk> team, <unk> a <unk> team.
<unk>: <unk>! <unk>: She's fine. The question is, it's good.
And this is that this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> from the north.
This is a river in <unk> <unk>.
<unk> had never <unk> <unk> levels.
This is the <unk> river, in the <unk> <unk>.
If you want to know how the <unk> goes up the sea level <unk> to <unk>, here is where the sea.
These <unk> are <unk>.
On the other part of the planet: <unk>, the largest <unk> of ice on the planet.
<unk>, last month, the <unk>, the ice <unk>, and that the <unk> of ice <unk>, which <unk> on some <unk> <unk>, is particularly <unk> in <unk>.
<unk> at six feet of the <unk> level, like <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, the third largest <unk> of ice, you see new <unk>, which a few years ago were <unk>.
40 percent of the world's population will <unk> half of the water from that <unk>.
<unk> <unk>: this <unk> is the source of water <unk> of this city.
The <unk> is <unk>.
But when you see, the same happens to the water.
It's <unk> to 40 percent <unk>.
<unk> <unk> are in the crisis.
<unk>, as you read, they're <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> in the world <unk> to a <unk> increase in <unk>.
<unk> <unk> are <unk> to a <unk> out of the normal and not <unk>.
Sometimes, over the last 30 years, at the last 30 years to the <unk> <unk>.
This is a <unk> of all <unk>.
If you look in the <unk> context, you can see the <unk>.
In the last five years, we've been <unk> 70 million <unk> of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million <unk> in the oceans.
Look at the <unk> <unk>, from <unk>, to <unk>, and on both <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, where there's a <unk> <unk> of oxygen in the oceans.
The greater cause of global warming, together to the <unk>, which is the use of <unk> <unk>.
<unk> is a problem, and <unk> is even worse.
The United States is one of the two countries with <unk>, China.
And it's <unk> to build many other <unk>.
But we're <unk> to a <unk> direction.
These are the projects that are <unk> in the last few years and some <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
And so, there's a <unk> in our country.
The <unk> of <unk> and oil <unk> have <unk> million dollars in the last year to <unk> <unk> <unk>, which is a <unk>.
I <unk> image to me --
<unk> <unk>, in <unk>, where I live, there was a <unk> of <unk> billion <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
Maybe you saw it on <unk>.
This is the second largest flow in America.
It's been <unk> around <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> of one of the <unk> <unk> was this.
<unk>: <unk>, <unk> <unk> is a happy and happy.
It's <unk> here in America, and it makes our economy.
<unk> the <unk> is more and more <unk>.
It's <unk>, <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> is a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The largest society <unk> on the <unk> is <unk>. This is his <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk>: <unk> clear, Al <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> -- they don't know what they're talking about.
<unk>: So <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> two <unk>.
This is one of them, one part.
<unk>: <unk>: <unk> <unk>, <unk>, we see the <unk> changes as a <unk> <unk> to our business.
This is a big amount of money in a <unk> <unk> to make public and <unk> the truth.
Actually, <unk> is not <unk>.
We think it's <unk> -- it also a good <unk>.
So we don't know about climate change.
We want to do it.
<unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk> -- you've heard a lot of it.
So we <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk>! <unk> are a little bit <unk>, but this is the sound of the technology of <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> is between the main <unk> of global <unk>, but the <unk> technology technology that you see changes everything.
Let's look at this: <unk> technology technology.
<unk>: <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> to the economic issue and the national security <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> America is in the crisis; the economy, national security, national security crisis.
The <unk> that <unk> all: our <unk> from the <unk> <unk>, like <unk> and <unk> oil <unk>.
Now, there's a new, <unk> <unk> solution to <unk>.
<unk> America: 100 percent of <unk> energy, in 10 years.
A plan to <unk> America to work, <unk> more <unk>, and help help <unk> global warming.
<unk>, a solution that we try to solve our problems.
<unk> America. <unk> more.
<unk>: This is the last.
<unk>: <unk>: It's about <unk> energy to America.
One of the most <unk> ways to <unk> <unk> to the <unk> from the <unk> that <unk> our planet.
<unk>: The future is here. <unk>, the sun, a new <unk> network.
<unk> <unk> 2: <unk> <unk> for jobs <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> America. It's time to be <unk>.
<unk>: A <unk> <unk> <unk> says, "If you want to go to your own, go alone.
If you want to go, go to the <unk>. "
We have to go far, fast.
Thank you very much.
<unk> year at TED, I made a <unk> on <unk>.
And I'm trying to <unk> about how the machine works.
So here. And for those who was not the other time there were no, the <unk> is the largest scientific experiment ever <unk> -- <unk> miles of <unk>.
His task is to <unk> the conditions that were in less than a <unk> <unk> by the beginning of the universe -- until <unk> million times a second.
And all of that is just <unk>.
This is the <unk> machine.
We <unk> these <unk> <unk> inside the <unk>.
This is what work on. It's called <unk> -- it's <unk> <unk> feet and it has a <unk> <unk>.
This is a picture of <unk> <unk> in this building, so you can see the <unk>.
<unk> <unk> last year, we've been <unk> the machine for the first time.
And this picture was taken by <unk>.
It was <unk> by <unk> <unk> in the control.
It's a picture of the first <unk> of particles that he had all the <unk>, <unk> in <unk>, <unk>, with a part of the <unk>, and <unk> particles inside the <unk>.
In other words, when you look at that picture the 10 <unk>, I'm going to say, the machine is a big <unk>.
I don't know if it was this to make us more or this, when somebody <unk> on Google and I knew the page <unk> that <unk> was this.
That means we've had a <unk> impact beyond to that scientific impact.
And a week later, there was a problem with the machine, had to be here -- these <unk> <unk>.
These <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> when the machine works at the <unk> <unk>.
Now, the <unk> of you <unk> the <unk> and <unk>, "It's not true. I'm too <unk>."
And they can do that, when they're very <unk>, they're <unk> <unk> <unk>.
So, <unk> degrees <unk>, at a <unk> temperature <unk> to that the space between the stars, these <unk> can bring that <unk>.
In one of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, there was a <unk> of <unk>.
So the <unk> <unk> <unk>, and the <unk> <unk> <unk> a electric <unk>.
This was the result.
Now, this is even more <unk> if you think that these <unk> are more than 20 <unk>, and that's <unk> about 30 <unk>.
They <unk> about 50 <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, what we've got.
We <unk> them and <unk>.
Now they're <unk> to their place.
And the end of <unk> the <unk> is going to be again.
We <unk> it, and we try to get some data to <unk> or <unk>, and continue so our <unk> to find out what the universe are.
Now, of course, in a way, these <unk> <unk> the <unk> of science and engineering engineering of <unk> engineering engineering and engineering of <unk>.
I think the fact that it's so hard, the fact that it's the value of things like <unk>.
I want to end with the words of a <unk> <unk>, <unk>, which, <unk>, <unk> of <unk> experiments of his <unk>, his <unk> was Michael, said, "It's not so <unk> to the progress of the human mind, how <unk> the <unk> that the ideas of science are <unk>, that there are no <unk> in nature, that our <unk> are <unk>, and not new <unk>."
Thank you.
I want to start <unk> to when, from children, <unk>, <unk>.
As I was <unk> and <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, actually to think and <unk> problems.
The <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> to the way that we <unk> most of the world around us.
So, from <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of our <unk> with objects, together with my <unk> <unk>, and my <unk> <unk> <unk>, I started <unk>, "And if, when we use a computer, instead of having the only <unk> <unk> <unk> as a digital <unk> that moves on a <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>,
and <unk> to our <unk>?
The question was so interesting that I thought I was going to explore the answer, building <unk>.
In a few words, a <unk> is a <unk> computer.
In a few words, a <unk> is a <unk> computer.
You can <unk> them with their hand, they can say, "<unk>" between them, feel their movement and they have a <unk> radio.
But <unk>, they're <unk> objects, like <unk>, you can just <unk> <unk>.
<unk> are the example of a new <unk> to <unk> the digital information.
And as they become more <unk>, <unk> of their movement, of their own, and they become more <unk>, <unk> of their movement, others, of their own movement, of how we <unk> them, we can explore new and <unk> <unk> <unk>.
I'll start with some simple example.
This <unk> is <unk> to show you some video: if you put it in a direction, the video, you'll see that, if you put it in a direction, you'll get back.
These <unk> <unk> are <unk> of the other.
If you <unk> them, you're <unk> to what's around them.
If they're <unk>, they're <unk>, they can <unk> a little bit.
If they're <unk>, they're <unk>, they can <unk> a little bit.
They also <unk> their movement and <unk>.
We've got one of the interesting <unk> <unk> was to be able to use common <unk> on data, for example, "<unk>" color as a <unk>.
In this case, we have three <unk> <unk> <unk> as a <unk> <unk> and I can <unk> to <unk> color, where you get <unk>.
and I can <unk> to <unk> color, in central <unk>, where you're <unk>.
If we <unk> too, we can <unk> a little bit of place.
There are also a chance to <unk>, like <unk>, <unk>, mathematics and games where people can try things things, and <unk> the results immediately, and they <unk> the results immediately.
Now, I'm --
This is a <unk> <unk> that I do with a <unk> program.
We have a game of words that is in half of <unk> and <unk>.
<unk>, at every <unk> <unk> a letter to <unk>, on every <unk>, every <unk>, <unk>, every <unk>, and as I was trying to <unk> words, and I'm going to try to <unk> it up with words.
Then, after about 30 seconds, you get <unk>, and you have a new <unk> of <unk> and new <unk> <unk>.
Thank you.
There we have children <unk> in <unk> to the <unk> <unk>, I did so that I <unk> them and <unk> a video.
They are very much.
And one of the interesting things about this kind of <unk> is that you don't have to give people a lot of <unk>.
I just say, "<unk> <unk>," and they know exactly what to do.
There we are other people who <unk> it.
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk>,
It actually wanted to be <unk>.
They were just <unk>, for him.
Now, this is a <unk> of a <unk> <unk>.
We wanted to build a tool for the <unk> of <unk>. He's <unk>.
It can <unk> new characters in the scene, they <unk> their <unk>.
It can <unk> new characters in the scene, they <unk> their <unk>.
And that's what it's doing is you get out of the sun.
<unk>: The sun is <unk>.
David <unk>: Now he's taken a <unk> in the scene.
<unk>: The <unk> <unk>.
<unk>. Yeah!
So, <unk> the <unk> and <unk> can <unk> the characters --
<unk>: <unk>!
<unk> your story.
<unk>: <unk>!
<unk>: It's a story with open open, and it can decide to decide how to be <unk>.
<unk>: It's a story with open open, and it can decide to decide how to be <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>, <unk>.
<unk>: The last example I have time to show you is a tool, made of <unk>, <unk> and <unk> music.
it's a tool, which recently made of <unk> and <unk> music.
The <unk> here are <unk> by <unk>, <unk>, and <unk>.
<unk> of these are four different <unk>, and you can choose what to use.
And you can also <unk> these <unk> in a <unk> <unk> to your <unk>.
And you just <unk> by doing a <unk>, a sound and a sequence.
These are the effects that you can control the live, like <unk> and <unk>.
And I'll give it a particular sound and then <unk> to <unk>.
And then there are the effects of time, as time and <unk>, that's <unk> to the whole sequence.
<unk> how it works.
<unk>: <unk> <unk>: <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk>, <unk> in a series of <unk>, the <unk> in a series, the <unk>, <unk> them into a series, the other basic <unk>.
Now let's take a <unk> line.
<unk>: <unk>. Now, <unk> <unk> --
<unk>: <unk>: And now I'll <unk> the <unk> to the <unk>, so I can control the <unk> of the live.
<unk>: <unk>: <unk>, I can <unk> the whole sequence of time on the other.
<unk>: <unk>: And now we'll get the <unk> down to the bottom to give more <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> the <unk>. I can <unk> the <unk>.
So I don't have to <unk>, but I can <unk>, I can <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
And now, finally, I can <unk> the whole sequence <unk> on the left <unk> <unk>.
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is to build new <unk> <unk> <unk> to how our brain work and body.
And today, I've had time to show you one of the results of the results of this <unk>, and some possibilities that we try to take out of the lab.
The concept that I want to <unk> is that's <unk> this new generation of <unk> objects to <unk> with media, that we want to <unk> information in our world in the way we want.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the time to talk to all of you.
I'm a <unk>.
My books is my <unk>, but it's more than this, obviously.
It's also love and love <unk> of my life.
And I don't look like that it can change.
But, I said this, something particular is happened in my life and my career, which has led to the whole relationship with this work.
The particular thing is, I wrote this book, this <unk> called "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, which, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, for some reason reason to <unk> in the world and <unk> a big, <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
And the result is that everywhere I'm going to <unk> now, people like I'm <unk>.
<unk> -- <unk>, <unk>!
I'm going to take you now and they say, "You don't fear, you don't get <unk> to do that?
You don't fear to go and write all the life that you can make a book that could <unk> to someone? "
Do you think about somebody? "
It's <unk>, you know.
But it could go worse, except for me, except for me 20 years ago, when I started to say to people -- I was a <unk> -- that I wanted to be a <unk>.
I'm going to come to the same <unk> <unk>.
And people said, "Don't you know, I don't know you have success?
You don't get fear <unk> <unk> you?
You don't get <unk> to do this <unk> all life, not that anything to be going to die on a <unk> of dreams with the <unk> <unk>'s mouth of <unk>? "
So, you know.
The short answer to all these questions is, "Yes."
Yeah, I'm afraid of all those things.
I've always been <unk>.
And I also fear of the other things that people could not be <unk>.
As <unk> and other things are <unk>.
But, as far as I was writing what I thought and I was <unk>, and I'm <unk> <unk> is why?
Is it <unk>?
It's <unk> that anyone who <unk> <unk> to be <unk> by a job that you feel in doing.
But what's about this particular is in the <unk> <unk> <unk> to a <unk> <unk> about health <unk> in a way that other <unk> do not?
How would my father, for example, he was a <unk> <unk> and I don't remember one time in his 40 years of <unk> in the 40 years of <unk> <unk> to be <unk>?
There was ever -- that <unk> of <unk> John, how does it goes?
I don't think, <unk>?
<unk>, engineers as <unk>, engineers as a group of <unk>, <unk>, <unk> the <unk> to be <unk> <unk>.
We <unk>, we have enough this <unk>, and not just <unk>, but <unk> of all sorts, we have this <unk> of being <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And I didn't know, you look at the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that, only in the <unk> century, young and often, as well as they were.
And the ones that are not <unk> seem to be really <unk> by their <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, before he died, in the last <unk> said, "My book gave me a little bit more." A <unk> <unk> about the work of their lives.
But we didn't know when we say it because we've heard these things so long that somehow we have all the way we've completely <unk> and <unk> the <unk> that creativity and <unk> are somehow <unk> and the <unk> are somehow, and the <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, always <unk> to <unk>.
And the question I want to tell you all here today is, you know, I agree with this idea?
It's good for you -- because also, <unk> by a <unk> distance to me, it's not good for this <unk>.
I think it's <unk>.
And I think it's also <unk>, I don't want to <unk> <unk> in the next century.
I think it's better to <unk> our great <unk> to live.
And I certainly know that, in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very <unk> to start <unk> to that <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in which I'm in my career.
<unk> -- <unk>, look, I'm quite young, I've got 40 years.
I still have about four <unk> of work in me.
And it's very <unk> that everything's going to happen now in the world, like the work that would be after the world's success of my last book.
<unk> <unk>, because we're all about, or not <unk>, that my greatest success is to my <unk>.
Oh, <unk>, <unk>, that thinking.
You know, this is the kind of thought that brings a person to start <unk> at nine <unk> in the morning, and I don't want to do that.
I love to keep doing this work that I love.
So, the question is, how?
And so, it seems to me, after many <unk>, that the way to work to keep on the one of the way to do to keep on the one.
I've got to get to some way of <unk> <unk> between me, which I'm <unk>, and my natural <unk> on what wrote would happen to get. And while I was going around the last year models of how to do it, to find find some other society to see if you want to have better ideas and see if you want more <unk>.
about how to help people <unk> to <unk> the <unk> <unk> of creativity.
And that research led me to the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
It's because they <unk> in <unk> and then they go back.
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> -- people don't believe that creativity <unk> creativity, <unk>, OK?
And he thought, he was <unk>, this <unk> spirit, and <unk> to men from some <unk> <unk> and <unk>, for reasons <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> <unk> these <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity.
<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> to have a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> were the same idea, but they had the <unk> of the spirit without a <unk>.
which is <unk>, because the <unk> didn't really know that a <unk> was somebody smart.
And I thought a <unk> was this kind of <unk> <unk> that <unk> literally <unk> in the <unk> of a <unk> artist, a little bit like <unk>, and <unk> out of <unk> the <unk> of that artist and <unk> out of <unk> the <unk> of that work.
<unk> <unk> <unk>, that's the distance from which I'm talking -- that <unk> <unk> you from the results of your work.
And everybody thought was so <unk>, right?
So, the <unk> artists were <unk> by <unk>, like the too <unk>, right?
If your work was <unk>, you didn't know, you didn't know, you know, <unk> that was <unk> <unk>.
If your work <unk>, it wasn't all your <unk>, right?
Everybody <unk> that was your <unk> to be a <unk>.
And so people are <unk> to creativity in <unk> for a long time.
And then the <unk> <unk> and everything, and we <unk> this great idea; we put the human center on the universe, all the universe, and <unk> and not let space to leave them and not leave and <unk> space to <unk> creatures that <unk> from <unk>.
This was the principle of <unk> <unk> and people thought about thinking that creativity is <unk> creativity, it was completely from <unk>.
And for the first time in history, you get to <unk> this or that artist as a <unk> to a <unk> that a <unk> person with <unk>.
And I have to say, I think it was a big <unk>.
I think that people who say, a simple person to believe that being like a <unk>, <unk> and <unk> of all the <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, all of all the <unk> and <unk> of all the <unk> of all the
It's like to ask someone to <unk> the sun.
<unk> and <unk> and <unk> all the <unk> and <unk> all these <unk> <unk> on the <unk>.
And I think it was this pressure to have been this pressure to have <unk> artists in the <unk> 500 years.
And if that's true, and I think it's true, the question is, the question now?
Can we do that?
We could go back to a more <unk> understanding of human relationship between human and <unk> <unk>.
or maybe not.
Maybe we can't <unk> 500 years of thinking about <unk>.
And there's probably people in the audience who <unk> <unk> <unk> on their <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, you know, people who are <unk> <unk> to their projects.
You probably don't tell you about this thing.
But the question I'd like to say to you is -- why not?
Why don't we <unk> this way?
Because it has more sense of everything that you've ever heard to explain the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> process.
One process that, as anyone who ever <unk> to do something -- so, basically, everybody here -- knows, you don't know <unk> <unk>.
And, in fact, in fact, sometimes it looks completely <unk>.
I did this <unk> <unk> with the extraordinary <unk> <unk>, who has now 90 years now, but that was a <unk> for all life and said that during her <unk> <unk>, and she said that during her <unk> <unk>, <unk> out of the <unk>, and they <unk> them, inside the <unk>, and they <unk> them, inside, when a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
She said, it was like a <unk> <unk>.
And she <unk> <unk> towards her from <unk>.
I could get to, because he was <unk> the land under his feet.
I thought I had one thing to do at that point, and he was, words, "<unk> like a <unk>."
And so he was <unk> up to the house and he was <unk> by this <unk>, and he didn't have to take any one piece of paper and a little bit fast <unk>, and they <unk> on the page.
Sometimes, you couldn't get enough enough, so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and she would <unk> her <unk> and she would <unk> the <unk> through the <unk>, looking, like she said, "another <unk>."
And then there were those times -- this thing, you never saw it -- there were some moments when it was almost <unk>, OK?
So, he was <unk> at home and he was looking for paper and <unk> the <unk> through, and he had a <unk> just in the while he was <unk>, and then said, that was like you to <unk> with the other hand and <unk>.
He <unk> the <unk> from the tail and he <unk> her body and he <unk> it on the page.
And in these cases, the <unk> would be <unk> on the <unk> page and <unk>, but on the last word to first.
So when you <unk> <unk> -- it's <unk>, it's exactly <unk> to my <unk> process.
Not all my process process -- I'm not a <unk>!
I'm a <unk>, and my way of <unk> is; I'm going to <unk> at the same <unk> every day and <unk> and <unk> on the <unk>.
But even me, in my <unk>, I <unk> against that thing, sometimes.
And I think that many of you <unk> that.
And you know, even if the work and ideas would be <unk> to me from a <unk> source, I couldn't have to be <unk> <unk>.
And what is what is this thing?
And how can we <unk> it so that you don't have to <unk> your head, but rather, what does it <unk> us?
As a <unk>, the best example I have is the <unk> <unk> <unk>, which I've been <unk> several years ago for a <unk>.
I was talking about this, and you know, <unk>, for the <unk> of life was the <unk> of the artist <unk> <unk>, trying to control, <unk>, <unk> these <unk> species of <unk> <unk>,
But then <unk>, he was <unk>, and one day while he was <unk> on a <unk> <unk>, he was going to <unk> <unk>, he was all about it.
<unk> fast and everything about a <unk> <unk>, this little <unk> of <unk>, that comes in his head as <unk> does <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, and you want, you know, it's wonderful, and the <unk>, but not as <unk>.
It's not a piece of paper, it doesn't have a <unk>, it doesn't have a <unk>.
So it starts to feel this kind of old <unk> <unk> in him, "I'm going to lose, and <unk> <unk> from this song.
I'm not enough <unk> and I can't <unk>. "
And instead of going to <unk>, they <unk>.
He <unk> the whole process and made something completely new.
He just <unk> the sky and said, "<unk>, you don't see I'm <unk>?"
"Do you think you can write a song now?"
If you really want to <unk>, you'll be <unk>, you'll get a more <unk> of you.
<unk>, <unk> to <unk> more today.
I'm going to <unk> <unk>. "
And his process was <unk> <unk> after this.
Not the work, it was still <unk> as always.
But the process, and the <unk> <unk> that <unk> was <unk> when they <unk> the <unk>, the <unk> that he was out of <unk>, and <unk> it back where, <unk> would not be something <unk> and <unk> it back to where, and they were not to be something <unk> and <unk>.
but I had this <unk>, wonderful <unk> <unk> a conversation between <unk> and this <unk> thing that is that it was not <unk>.
So how I <unk> that story is to change a little bit of a way I'm going to do and I'm going to give you a time.
This idea, I was when I was <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and I would go to one of the <unk> <unk> where we're all working on something and you can't get up to think that it's going to be a <unk>, that what's going to ever ever happen.
Not just <unk>, just <unk>, just the book wrote.
And we started thinking about <unk> this project.
But then I <unk> to <unk> that <unk> up and <unk>.
So I <unk> my face on the <unk> and I'll give my face to a <unk> <unk> of the room.
And I said to <unk>, "<unk>, what, both of them, we know that if this book is not going to be <unk>, no?
Because, as you see, I'm <unk> everything I have, I don't have that.
So if you want it to be better, you have to <unk> and do your part.
OK. But if you don't do it, you know what, I don't like it.
I was writing the same because it's my job.
And I'd like to say, please, that I'm sure I'm <unk> to do my part. "Because at the end is like this, OK -- <unk> is how much of the <unk> of the moon, they <unk>, and music <unk> that would be <unk> for hours and hours to <unk>.
And they were always <unk>, because the <unk> were <unk> and they were <unk>.
But every once a while, something <unk>, and one of these artists really <unk>.
And I know what I'm going to talk about, because I know that you've all of them, at a point, a <unk> like this.
It was like time, and the <unk> <unk> through a kind of <unk> and it was not doing anything else else else that's usually, like the <unk> first, but it's all <unk>.
And suddenly they don't just <unk> as a human.
But it's <unk> by <unk> and <unk> under the <unk> of <unk>.
And when this <unk>, at the time, people would tell what was, I saw it with her name.
<unk> your hands and <unk> to <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, God," God, "
That's God, you know.
<unk> <unk> <unk> -- when the <unk> <unk> the <unk> of <unk>, I saw this <unk> with them and the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, which you can hear in the <unk> or in the <unk>.
In <unk>, when a artist has done something impossible and <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> -- a <unk> of God.
And it's <unk> because we need it.
But the problem comes the day, the <unk> itself, when you get <unk> and <unk> that are the 11 <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> of God's <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
It's just a <unk> <unk> with great <unk> to <unk>, and perhaps never <unk> to that <unk>.
And perhaps nobody <unk> the name of God still, and what does that have to do with the rest of her life?
It's hard.
This is one of the most <unk> <unk> to do in a <unk> life.
But perhaps it doesn't have to be so <unk> if you can't believe, <unk>, that the most <unk> of your being from yourself.
But I just <unk> that you have data from a <unk> source of this <unk> part of this <unk> part of your life, you have to go to <unk> when you finished.
And, you know, if we think it's all about it.
And so I started <unk>, and it's what I've been <unk> for several months during the book that was soon, the <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> of my
And what I have to keep <unk> when I feel like to <unk>, is not afraid.
I don't know. You just don't do it.
You can start <unk> for your hand, any <unk> can be.
If your work is <unk>, <unk>.
If the <unk>, you'll be <unk> to you <unk> <unk> some kind of <unk>, for one moment through your <unk>, then "<unk>!"
You do the same your <unk>.
And <unk>! "<unk>!" <unk> "to you.
I think it's <unk>.
"<unk>!" <unk> "to you, even for having a human love and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk>: <unk>!
As you know, I've talked about some of these projects on the human genome, what can <unk> and the discovery of new genes.
We're going to take a new way of: we started <unk> biology and now from that digital code we're <unk> into a new <unk> of biology, <unk> and <unk> life.
We've always been trying to <unk> great questions.
"What is life?" It's something that many <unk>, I think they have <unk> to figure out out of levels.
We tried several <unk>, <unk> to the <unk> terms.
We're <unk> for almost 20 years.
When we <unk> the human genome to <unk> to go from the <unk> world of biology to the digital world.
Now, we can <unk> life, or create new life from this digital universe?
This is the map of a little <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, which is the <unk> species from the <unk> genome between those that can <unk> into the lab.
And we tried to <unk> <unk> the genome to <unk> one even smaller.
We can <unk> a <unk> of about 500 <unk> of about 500 that are here.
But when you look at his map <unk> map, it's simple respect to our.
<unk>, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can <unk>, one at one at the time, it's very <unk> that this can bring a <unk> cell.
So I thought that the only way to <unk> was <unk> this <unk> to <unk> the <unk> to <unk> some of these questions.
And so we started the <unk> of the "We can <unk> a <unk>?"
Can the chemistry <unk> of making these big molecules that we've never been able to create these big molecules that we've never been able to create these big molecules that we've never been able to do this before?
And, in case, can we make a <unk>?
A <unk> is just a piece of <unk> material.
The speed we're able to <unk> life is <unk> to <unk> <unk>.
Our <unk> <unk> the code, instead, it's <unk> slowly, but it's <unk>.
And our <unk> results that <unk> <unk> on a <unk> <unk>.
We've been <unk> over 15 years ago.
The process has <unk> a lot of <unk>, <unk> with a <unk> <unk> before they saw the first experiments.
But we found that DNA <unk> is very difficult.
There are <unk> of thousands of cars, on the world that are little <unk> of DNA <unk>, <unk> <unk> to 50 <unk>, and it's a <unk> process: the more <unk> is long, the <unk> there are.
So we had to develop a new way to <unk> these <unk> and <unk> the <unk>.
And this was our first <unk>, starting to be <unk>, digital <unk> genome.
It's a small virus that <unk> bacteria.
We designed the <unk>, we <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> a DNA <unk> of about <unk> <unk>.
The interesting part is when we took this piece of <unk> material and we <unk> it into the bacteria, bacteria have <unk> to read this code and <unk> the <unk> particles.
<unk> particles are <unk> out of cells, are <unk> back and they <unk> the <unk> <unk>.
I've talked about the <unk> of <unk> industry, who have certainly <unk> this model.
They have <unk> more than you.
And I think this is a situation where the software can really build the same <unk> in a <unk> system.
But you could do the biggest things in the big thing.
We wanted to build the whole <unk> of <unk>.
They are more than <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
So we thought about <unk> <unk> <unk>, so we could change the <unk> to understand what the <unk> are the <unk> of a virus.
<unk> is <unk>, and if you start with information <unk> in a computer, it's got to be very <unk>.
When I first saw this genome for the first time in <unk>, the standard <unk> was a <unk> for every 10 <unk> <unk>.
We found, <unk>, <unk>, 30 <unk>. If you could use that original sequence, you could never be able to do it work.
A process of the process is designing <unk> <unk> 50 <unk>, <unk>, and <unk>, and it's a little bit of the process is to make smaller <unk> <unk> to build smaller <unk> <unk>.
And I was <unk> <unk> here.
You probably read that <unk> us of <unk>.
So, we have a <unk> code on four <unk>: A, <unk>, <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> of those <unk> <unk> <unk> together about 20 <unk>, and there's a <unk> order to <unk> every <unk>.
So we can use the code for <unk> words, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
What we did at the beginning was <unk>.
Some of them were <unk> by the fact that it was not <unk>.
We designed these <unk> to <unk> just <unk> with <unk>.
There are <unk> that they <unk> them and <unk> them.
And we started to <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> to seven <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> to them, and they <unk> them to <unk> <unk>.
But every step we've made these <unk> in <unk> so that we could make a <unk> <unk> that we're trying to create a very <unk> <unk>, as you'll see in a minute.
We're trying to <unk> the process.
So, this seems to be the <unk> of a <unk> <unk>.
When you get to these very <unk>, very <unk>, over 100 <unk> <unk>, you don't get any more than 100 <unk> <unk>, you know, you know, when you get to these <unk>, you know, when you get to these <unk>, very <unk>, you don't get directly to the <unk>
You get to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> biology.
So we've got some other <unk>.
<unk> of another <unk> called <unk> <unk> <unk>, which in biology <unk> to <unk> DNA to <unk> the <unk>.
So, this is an example.
This <unk>, called <unk> <unk>, can <unk> three million <unk> of <unk>.
You can see in the <unk> <unk> like her <unk> is <unk>.
And it's about 24 hours, it's <unk> as before.
<unk> thousands of organisms that are able to do that.
These organisms can <unk> completely.
We had to live under <unk>.
I'm absolutely sure that life <unk> in space, and you're <unk> to find new <unk> of water.
Actually, NASA showed that this is happening.
This is a picture of the <unk> that we've built using these <unk>, just using the <unk> with the design <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> <unk> them.
This picture was not <unk> with a <unk> <unk>, but with a <unk> <unk>.
It's a <unk> so big that we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk>.
These are pictures that <unk> a period of about six seconds.
This is the <unk> that we've done a little time ago.
They are more than <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's the largest <unk> of a <unk> structure that's ever <unk> by man.
It's got a <unk> <unk> at 300 million.
If you <unk> it with a <unk> 10, not you'll be <unk> pages to <unk> this code.
Now, how do we make it work? How can we <unk>?
<unk>, <unk> is a <unk> <unk>,
It's a little bit more <unk> when you use of bacteria.
It's easier when it's <unk> cells like our <unk>: you can just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> another, which is basically the process of <unk>.
In <unk>, <unk>, the <unk> is instead, we put it into the cell, but we've <unk> <unk> that we're able to do a <unk> <unk> of a other cell and <unk>.
We've <unk> a <unk> <unk> by a kind of <unk>.
The two are the way the men from <unk>.
We've got some <unk> <unk> more <unk> so that we could decide what to choose for this <unk>.
He's got <unk> with <unk> so that they could <unk> all the <unk>.
And when we put it in the cell was <unk> and we <unk> our <unk> <unk> the new <unk> went into the cell.
And <unk> <unk> that you didn't want to go beyond, but we tried to <unk> more in there.
This is one of the largest <unk> of evolution.
We found that <unk> species have <unk> a second or a third <unk> somewhere, <unk>, <unk> in a second thousands of new <unk> to that species.
So who think about evolution as a <unk>, as a <unk> at the time, you know, you know, the <unk> of biology.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> that was in the cell, they didn't know.
The <unk> <unk> we've <unk> it.
It's <unk>, and it <unk> the other <unk> as <unk>, has <unk> it, and we just <unk> with the cell and the new <unk>.
it's become blue because of the genes we've <unk>.
And in a short short short of time, all the <unk> of a species are you <unk>, and you've got all the <unk> into a new species, <unk> on the new software that we <unk> in the cell.
All the <unk> are <unk>, <unk> are <unk>, and when you look at the code, when you're <unk> the code exactly what we've <unk> you.
Now, this could seem <unk> <unk>, but we <unk> the software, we can change things that's quite <unk>.
Now, I've already <unk> that you don't talk about <unk> -- but of progress, from three million years and a half million years of evolution, and I've already said that maybe we're to create a new version of <unk>, where we <unk> <unk> new species on this digital process.
Why do that?
I think it's quite <unk>, when we think of our <unk>.
We're going to go from six and a half billion people to <unk> billion people in the next 40 years.
Just to give you an example: I was born in <unk>.
Now there are three people on the planet to <unk> <unk> in <unk>; in 40 years, there will be four years.
We're <unk> problems now to find food, water and <unk>, <unk> and <unk> and <unk> for six billion people.
I'm going to have to do it for nine billion.
<unk> over five billion billion <unk>, over 30 billion <unk> of <unk>.
That means 100 million <unk> a day.
When we try to find <unk> <unk>, or any kind of process to <unk>, it's going to be a huge challenge.
We have to realize all of CO2 from these materials that <unk> in the atmosphere.
At the day, because of the <unk> <unk> of the whole world, we have a <unk> with about 20 million genes, and I like to think that are <unk> <unk> for the future.
The <unk> industry just a <unk> about <unk>, and think about how many different things are out.
Our <unk> is <unk> data from the reality here is <unk> and our imagination.
Now we have <unk>, because of these <unk> <unk> <unk>, able to create what we call <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We can build a big robot that can produce a big robot that can produce a million <unk> a day.
Think of <unk> these 20 million genes, or try to <unk> the <unk> to produce <unk> or <unk>, new <unk>, we can change, because of a small team, and create more <unk> biology, and create more <unk> biology, which is now that in the last 20 years of science.
And it's just a standard <unk>.
We can choose to <unk> <unk>, chemistry or <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
This is a <unk> of some software software <unk> that we're working on to be able to <unk> and design species to the computer.
Well, we don't know how they will be.
We know exactly what their code is.
We're now going to <unk> the <unk> generation.
You saw that <unk> from the <unk> was a <unk> experiment, it was a little bit of wrong.
We've <unk> <unk> <unk> and third generation that we had enough to <unk> <unk> <unk> as much as the <unk> or <unk> <unk>.
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without <unk> <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the <unk> would be <unk> CO2 in matter before, so we're working on to design cells that can reach that, and we think we can get the first <unk> <unk> generation in about 18 months.
<unk> <unk> <unk> with CO2 is a <unk>, but in our <unk> discovery around the world, we've found several <unk>.
This is a <unk> that we've <unk> in <unk>.
<unk> in the deep ocean, about <unk> feet of <unk> at the <unk> of water.
We're <unk> by CO2 using hydrogen <unk> as a source of energy.
We're trying to figure out if we can <unk> CO2, that can easily be <unk> by <unk>, <unk> that CO2 in <unk>, to drive this process.
So short, we think that we could be able to <unk> what the basic question, "which is the <unk> of life. We, we, we have the <unk> goal of <unk> the whole industry.
<unk>. If you can't do that from TED, where can't you?
We had a <unk> source of energy.
And we're working for the same <unk> to create <unk> <unk>.
You've seen this year with flu, we're always back a year and with a dollar less when it's about finding the right <unk>.
I think what you can change is <unk> <unk>.
That's what the future could start to look like <unk>, now, the tree of evolution, <unk> the evolution with bacteria, <unk>, <unk> cells.
We are so <unk> people.
Our purpose is to make a way of living enough to try to get it. Thank you very much.
So, first of all, I'm going to show you, the <unk> <unk>, some fundamental <unk> of the new technology that we've taken to a <unk> <unk> to a <unk> almost a year ago. This is <unk>.
It's a environment where you can <unk> both <unk> to the local level that you can see it's on a huge amount of data.
We're seeing <unk> <unk> <unk> with a kind of picture of <unk> <unk> and <unk>, for a fast <unk>, <unk> <unk> the images like we want.
And it doesn't matter how big the amount of information that we see, how big these data are, or the images.
Most of them are <unk> photographs, but this example is a <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of <unk>, and I'm going to <unk> in the <unk> 300 <unk>.
It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that <unk> the <unk> of a system like this is the number of <unk> on your screen at any time. It's also a very <unk> architecture.
This is a whole book, an <unk> of data, not of <unk>.
This is the <unk> <unk> <unk>. Every <unk> <unk> a <unk>.
And so, in fact, in the <unk> and not of images, we can do something like this, to actually see that it's a real <unk>, not a picture.
It could be a little bit <unk> to read a book.
I'm not going to tell you.
This is an <unk> example. This is a <unk> number of <unk>.
Every picture is the beginning of a <unk>.
And it really gives you the <unk> and the good experience of reading the real version of a <unk> or a <unk>, which is a <unk> <unk>, which is a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We also did something with the corner of this particular number of the <unk>.
We created a <unk> <unk> <unk> much higher than what you use in a normal <unk>, and we've <unk> <unk> <unk>.
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk>, you can see here.
or some <unk> <unk>, even <unk> <unk>.
And this really <unk> some of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of space on the screen.
And I thought this was going to be <unk> to the <unk> and other <unk> <unk>, not to be <unk>.
Of course, <unk> is one of the most <unk> <unk> for this kind of technology.
And on this, I don't want to lose time, if not say that we have <unk> to give that.
These are all the streets in the United States <unk> on a NASA <unk> image.
So now we'll start something else.
This is actually live on the web; you can see it.
This is a project called <unk>, which <unk> two different technologies.
One is <unk> and the other is a very interesting research that was a very interesting research computer, a student of Washington, with the help of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. <unk> <unk>.
And it's alive on the web, <unk> <unk>.
You can see when we do this kind of <unk>, where we can go from a picture to the other and have this kind of experience <unk>.
But the <unk> <unk> of the images here actually actually have a meaning.
The <unk> of <unk> computers have <unk> these images together, so that they <unk> to the places that <unk> all the <unk> to the places that <unk> all the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> have been <unk>. Here's what you see is a <unk> <unk> or <unk>, and these are all <unk> <unk>.
I don't know if I have time to show you some other environment.
There are some much more <unk>.
I want to go to one of the <unk> of <unk> data, and this <unk> from a <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> that we've done for the first summer summer to show you what's really the key behind this technology, the <unk> technology, the <unk>. And it's not <unk> as <unk> by looking at the <unk> that we've put in the website.
We had to <unk> some <unk> and <unk> and forth.
This is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> of <unk> and so on. <unk> of these <unk> <unk> and so on. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. And so, you know, you know, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
So, I'm all <unk> images from <unk> and they've been all <unk> at this way.
And it's possible to <unk> this way.
You know, I would never have thought of going to work to <unk>.
It's very <unk> to <unk> this kind of <unk> here.
I think you can see that's a lot of different <unk>: from those <unk> to <unk> <unk>, a <unk> number, <unk>, a <unk> number, <unk> together in this environment.
And if I can, I can, I can try and look at those <unk>.
Many of them are <unk>, etc.
<unk> a few part here, it's a series of photographs -- <unk>.
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We can go from the <unk> to the physics of this environment.
The <unk> point is that we can do things with the social environment. This is now <unk> data from the whole memory of how to <unk> the land, from the <unk> perspective and <unk> all that data together.
All those pictures become <unk> together, greater than the <unk> of the parts.
You have a whole model of the whole thing that you get.
Think about this as the <unk> of <unk>'s work on Earth <unk>.
It's something that <unk> in <unk> complexity as people who <unk> him, and <unk> for who are <unk> <unk> with the use.
Their pictures are <unk> with <unk> <unk> by other people.
If somebody comes the idea of <unk> all these <unk>, you know, my picture of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> all of that data, and I can use it as a <unk> <unk> to <unk> in that space, in that <unk>, using the pictures of anyone, and have a social experience <unk>.
Of course, a <unk> of all that are extremely <unk> models of every interesting part of the land, <unk> not only by <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I got it right? What your software <unk> us to do is that at some point, in the next few years, all the photographs that's going to anyone in the whole world's <unk> together?
<unk>: Yeah. What's doing is basically <unk>.
It's creating <unk>, if you want, between images.
And it's doing it in the content of images.
And what becomes very interesting if you think about <unk> information information that a lot of these images.
As you do a research research of images, you <unk> a <unk> and the text on the web page has a lot of information about images.
Now, what happens if that picture is <unk> to all your picture?
So the amount of <unk> <unk> and the amount of <unk> <unk>, and the amount of <unk> that's a <unk> <unk>.
CA: <unk>, it's really incredible.
<unk>: I'm going to tell you a lot.
One of the main <unk> when you <unk> and one of the <unk> research <unk> is the to be able to live between who has no <unk> <unk>, between the past the wind, the wind <unk> in the <unk> <unk> of plants.
I think the <unk> <unk> <unk> even beyond the <unk> <unk>, or the <unk> <unk>, or the <unk> <unk> <unk> are still <unk> <unk> <unk>, or <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> the central <unk>, and that the idea that the world in which we live in in in which we don't exist in a sense, but it's just a kind of <unk>,
And the <unk> of a particular <unk> of choices that our <unk> has done, well or bad, a lot of <unk> does.
And, of course, all the <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
Everybody <unk>.
We're <unk> to <unk>.
We have to deal with the death <unk>, so we don't know if you <unk> and <unk> --
We all have a art.
What <unk> is the particular <unk> of the song, the <unk> of the <unk> of every culture's <unk>.
It doesn't matter that they're the <unk> of <unk>, or the <unk> of <unk> <unk>, or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, or a <unk> in the heart of <unk>.
He was my <unk> <unk> journey in <unk> a month ago, or a <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk>, on <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>'s mother of the world.
All of these <unk> <unk> us that there are other ways to think, other ways to think, other ways to move in the world.
And if you just <unk> a minute, it's a concept that can give you hope.
<unk>, the <unk> of the world create a <unk> of life and <unk> that <unk> the planet, and it's important for the <unk> of the planet, as the <unk> <unk> <unk> known as <unk>.
And you can think of this <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and you can <unk> the <unk> of all the <unk>, dreams, <unk>, ideas, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, ideas, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, ideas, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, ideas, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, ideas, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, ideas, ideas, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>
The <unk> is the fantastic <unk> of humanity.
It's the <unk> of what we are and what we can be as <unk> species.
And <unk> the <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, it was <unk> and <unk> much faster.
<unk> <unk>, for example, <unk> that 50 percent of all species has been or is on the <unk> of <unk>, because it's <unk>, or <unk> <unk> -- in the <unk> <unk> -- and you don't even <unk> to the <unk> <unk> -- that <unk> diversity.
The <unk> of this is, of course, the <unk> <unk>.
When you're <unk> <unk> <unk> on this planet.
A language is not just <unk> by a <unk> or a <unk> of <unk> rules.
A language is the <unk> of the human spirit.
It's the middle of the way that it every culture is coming in in the material world.
Every language is a forest of the mind, a <unk>, a <unk>, a <unk> of <unk>.
And of those <unk> <unk>, while we're here sitting in the <unk>, at least half't comes to the children's <unk>.
They don't come back to children, which means, unless you know something, who are already death.
What's more <unk> than the <unk>, the <unk>, the last to talk about being <unk>, the language of being <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> the children?
This <unk> <unk> was the state of somebody in the world's been a few weeks, that every two weeks. every two weeks, a <unk> and <unk> the <unk> of a <unk> language.
And I know that somebody of you say, "I don't?
The world would not be a better place if we could all the same language? "And then we're talking about it.
<unk> <unk>.
It's a <unk> thing to say, not to be able to talk about their language.
I'd like to give you a journey through the <unk> --
a small journey in the <unk> to give you a <unk> of what we're trying to do.
Many of us will say, when I say, "I mean," I mean, "I mean," I really think, different ways of <unk>.
And so, for example, this <unk> <unk>, <unk>, the <unk> of <unk>, which <unk> to the <unk> <unk> from the river <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's a <unk> that it's not able to <unk> the blue color from green because the <unk> time is <unk> in the forest, that <unk> the <unk>.
They have a <unk> language and a <unk> rule, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, which is a different language.
And all of this, all of this <unk> in the past, the <unk> is that in these families families, where you're talking about six or seven <unk> because of the <unk> <unk> <unk>. <unk>, no <unk> language.
You start to listen and then you start talking about.
I had one of the most interesting <unk> that I lived with the <unk> <unk>, an incredible <unk> that had the first <unk> in <unk>.
In <unk>, five <unk> have <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk>.
They made <unk> photographs that they <unk> them in <unk> <unk>, <unk> that this <unk> of the <unk> forest <unk> had never seen anything <unk>.
They <unk> the picture from the ground, they <unk> to a <unk> or a <unk> and, they didn't know, they've <unk> <unk> <unk>, and they <unk> the five <unk> with the <unk>.
But <unk> didn't just <unk> the <unk>.
They <unk> to each other.
<unk> percent of the <unk> was <unk> by themselves.
We're <unk> at eight <unk> and we found two natural death, and when we <unk> to know, they've been so that they died <unk>, and then they <unk> it up. And then they <unk> it. And then they <unk> it. And then they <unk> it.
<unk> were able to recognize the animal <unk> from 40 <unk> and to <unk> the species.
<unk> years, I was really interesting task, I was really interesting, when my <unk> <unk> of <unk>, I would like to go to the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to do <unk>.
To give a sense of <unk>, I should have to understand the <unk> culture and that the <unk> is not <unk> <unk>.
It's quite a very <unk> view of the world.
Very interesting.
If you try to <unk> the great <unk> of the world, what would you tell me?
<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, etc.
A lot of <unk>, and thinking, thinking, Africa didn't have <unk> <unk>. And instead, the <unk> is not anything else that the <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
What makes interesting is the <unk> relationship between life and death.
So <unk> are <unk> to <unk>.
<unk> can be <unk> by the <unk> <unk>, <unk> to the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> to the live <unk> in such a little bit that is the <unk>.
This is why <unk> <unk> to say, "<unk> go to <unk> to talk about God.
We <unk> in the <unk> and <unk> God. "
And from the moment that you're <unk>, is the spirit that you <unk>, how can you get <unk>?
So, you know, you're going to get into these incredible events: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a rather <unk> of the power of mind is in a <unk> <unk>.
I <unk> all the <unk> with which I lived the most <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, in the <unk> <unk>.
<unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, which once <unk> on the <unk> <unk> of <unk>, the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
In a <unk> continent, this <unk> never been <unk> by <unk>.
In <unk>, they're <unk> by a <unk>, but their education is extraordinary.
The young <unk> are <unk> from <unk> to <unk> or four years, and live <unk> in a world world that's done of <unk> and <unk> <unk> to the base <unk> for 18 years.
Two <unk> years <unk> of nine years, I'm going to <unk> the nine months of <unk> that <unk> in the <unk> of the mother, now are <unk> in the <unk> <unk>.
For this time, they're <unk> to the values of their society, values that they <unk>, and just their <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or to say the <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or to say the <unk> <unk>.
And at the term of this incredible <unk>, they're <unk> out and for the first time in their life, at the age of 18, see a <unk>. And in that moment of the first <unk>, when the sun comes to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, everything they've learned in <unk> theory, everything they have learned in theory theory, he says a <unk>. The <unk> does a <unk> <unk>.
"<unk>? I'm going to tell you.
It's <unk>. Now it's <unk> to you. "
They call the <unk> <unk> and they say we, <unk> <unk>, we are the <unk> of the world's <unk>.
This <unk> level is extremely important.
When we think about <unk> <unk> and the <unk> environment and the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>, which is a <unk> concept in his <unk> or maybe <unk> <unk> and <unk> and say these are <unk> <unk> to the Earth.
<unk> <unk> are not <unk> or <unk> <unk> by <unk>.
There is no space for these things in the <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk>, but because of the time and the <unk>, they created a <unk> of the Earth <unk>, not on the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>, but on a <unk> <unk>, the concept that the Earth can live because it is <unk> by the human <unk>.
What does that mean?
I mean that a <unk> <unk> <unk> that the mountain is a <unk> of <unk> that <unk> <unk> is a human being <unk> <unk>, and it will be <unk> different and will have a very <unk> different relationship with the mountain or that place a <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> that a mountain is a <unk> <unk> to be <unk>.
<unk> is the <unk> of a spirit or a <unk> <unk> is <unk>.
What's interesting is the <unk> that <unk> the relationship between the <unk> and the natural world.
I grew up in the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, which <unk> <unk> to be <unk>.
That made me a human being different from my friends who believe that <unk> are the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> that are living in the <unk> <unk>.
If you start to <unk> that these <unk> can create reality, <unk>, we start to understand some of their <unk> <unk>. They have this <unk>.
I <unk> this picture in <unk> in the <unk> <unk>.
Maybe some of you have heard about <unk>, the most powerful <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
What makes the <unk> is not the <unk> potential of <unk>, but its <unk>. It's <unk> by two elements.
On one side, this <unk> <unk> a series of <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
<unk> the only <unk> is a <unk> <unk> that you <unk> a little bit, but it's <unk> with the <unk> of a <unk>'s family <unk> <unk>.
This <unk> has <unk> <unk>, very similar to <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
If you ever see the <unk> <unk> on the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk> has <unk> <unk>.
It's going to be <unk>, it's a little bit like being <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a sea. It doesn't create a <unk> of reality; it makes the <unk> of reality.
I often <unk> with my <unk>, Richard <unk> <unk>, the man who <unk> the <unk> was <unk>, with his discovery of <unk> <unk> in the '<unk>.
And my <unk> is not <unk> these <unk>, as a <unk>, because if you're done, you can't tell anybody to be <unk>. <unk> <unk>, but they're <unk> <unk>, but they're <unk> by a <unk> that's <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
It's possible to <unk> <unk> only if you <unk> with other <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Now, what's the <unk> that's what's going to happen: the <unk> that are in this <unk> of the same thing to <unk> <unk>. The question is: in a <unk> of plants, how these <unk> <unk> to <unk> two <unk>, not the one, but that if you <unk> this way, they make a <unk> <unk>, which is <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk>?
We use the great <unk> of <unk> and <unk>, which can <unk> <unk>.
But if you go to the <unk>, we'll get "The plants talk about it."
What does that mean?
This <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, who <unk> <unk> in the forest, and our eyes will <unk> in the same species.
If you <unk> them as they <unk> their <unk>, "<unk>" <unk> "<unk>" <unk> "<unk>" <unk> "<unk>." I said, "No."
The solution is: you take the <unk> <unk> in a night night with a different night.
And so, you don't start to <unk>, but it's much more interesting than you <unk> the <unk>.
Now, the problem is that even those of us who have heart <unk> <unk> them, but somehow <unk> to the <unk> of history of <unk> to our real history of <unk> to the world's history of <unk> with our real world, and it's beyond.
In fact, the <unk> century, in 300 years, not <unk> <unk> for his <unk> or his <unk> <unk>, but rather like the one that we <unk> and <unk> the <unk> of the planet. Now the problem is not the change.
All the <unk> through the <unk> were <unk> in a <unk> for new possibilities of life.
And the problem is not technology.
The <unk> <unk> have not <unk> to be <unk> when they put <unk> <unk> and <unk> as they don't have <unk> to be <unk> when they put <unk> and <unk>.
It's not the change or technology that <unk> the <unk> of <unk>. It's the power.
The <unk> <unk> of <unk>.
And if you look at a <unk> in the world, I'll see that these are not <unk> <unk> to <unk>.
They are <unk> creatures and <unk> <unk> out of the <unk> forces that go beyond their <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> --
a <unk> <unk> <unk>, in <unk> <unk>, a <unk> that has been <unk> free in the forest until a generation of <unk>, and now <unk> to the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk>, where you can see the <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk>,
We started to <unk> <unk> with the <unk> <unk> to the forest.
Or, in the <unk>, the diseases that are <unk> with the <unk> discovery.
If you're <unk> on the <unk> of <unk>, where I'm doing a lot of research, you'll see the <unk> <unk> of political <unk>.
As a <unk> <unk>, <unk> physics of a <unk>, is <unk> at the <unk> level, but the <unk>, the <unk> of <unk>, not only is <unk>, but <unk> <unk> in certain <unk>, because part of the development of the development of the development of the development.
And you can't understand the <unk> of <unk> until you get part of the <unk>.
I've been <unk> miles from <unk> in the Western China through the <unk> <unk>, <unk> to <unk> with a young <unk>, but only got to <unk>. I realized what's behind the <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> million people <unk> from the <unk> <unk> during the <unk> <unk>.
The father of this guy was <unk> to the <unk> <unk>.
which means that it was <unk> to the Chinese times.
<unk> <unk> is <unk> with <unk> <unk> during the <unk> that led to <unk> in <unk>.
My mother was <unk> and her <unk> was to be <unk>.
It was taken of <unk> in <unk> at the age of two <unk>, under his <unk>, because he couldn't have to live without him.
The <unk>, who did the same, was <unk> in <unk>.
A day, he <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk>, and this <unk>, it was <unk> to work for seven years.
The pain of <unk> can be <unk>, but the <unk> spirit of <unk> is <unk> by <unk>.
And it was going to end, everything <unk> to a choice.
Do we live in the world's <unk> or we want to <unk> the <unk> world of diversity of diversity?
The big <unk> <unk> <unk>, first of death, before he died said that his greatest fear was that, in our <unk> to this <unk> view of the world, not only <unk> the whole <unk> of human imagination to a <unk> <unk> to a <unk> <unk> that there were other possibilities.
And it's <unk> to remember that our species is <unk> for <unk> years.
The <unk> <unk>, which has given us agriculture, that made us <unk>, <unk> the <unk> of <unk>, <unk> the <unk> with the <unk> of <unk>, creating the <unk> of <unk>, creating the <unk> of <unk>, and we talk about <unk> years ago.
The <unk> world has been <unk> 300 years.
That <unk> story, I didn't know, I'm going to say that we could be able to <unk> in the <unk> to come.
When these <unk> <unk> of the world's <unk>, what they want to be human, <unk> with <unk> <unk>.
And it's in these answers that we all know the possibility of being what we are: a <unk> species, that has to make all the <unk> and all the <unk> can be <unk>. And there are great moments of <unk>.
I took this picture on the north of the island of <unk>, when I went to <unk> <unk> with <unk>, and this man, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> the wonderful story of her <unk>.
The government <unk> was not always <unk> with the <unk> <unk> and the '<unk> to <unk> our <unk>, we <unk> them in <unk>.
The <unk> of this man is <unk> of <unk>.
The family, <unk> for her life, <unk> all the <unk>, and all his <unk>.
You want to know that <unk> don't <unk>, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, <unk>.
The <unk> of <unk> fish were made of fish <unk> in <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> of this man didn't <unk> from night or <unk> <unk>.
It's <unk>, you <unk> the <unk> in your skin of <unk> and <unk> in your hand. When I did it, they <unk> them to create a <unk>.
He <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk> <unk> and when <unk> <unk>, he <unk> a dog.
He <unk> the dog and created a <unk>, and he created a <unk>, he's <unk> a <unk>, he <unk> another dog, and it's <unk> on the <unk>, <unk> <unk> in <unk>.
Do you talk about <unk> with anything?
<unk> <unk> <unk> the government <unk> to <unk> the total of <unk> an area of <unk> larger <unk> of California and <unk> together.
It's their new <unk>. It's called <unk>.
It's a <unk> <unk>. It's a <unk> <unk>.
One example of how a <unk> can <unk> with her <unk>.
And, to end, I think it's quite <unk> at least to the people who are in these <unk> areas of the planet, realize that they're not <unk> at all.
For somebody is home.
<unk> <unk> of the human imagination that <unk> to the <unk> of the time. And for all of us, the dreams of these children, like the dreams of <unk>.
And so, we know, we've been <unk> that <unk> never <unk> to anything.
I think <unk> <unk> --
They're not <unk>, but we believe that stories can change the world, and perhaps we're the best <unk> to tell the stories of the world. Every month our website is <unk> million <unk> of <unk> million <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> our <unk>.
Our <unk> are <unk> by millions of people.
Our work is <unk> in <unk> to bring our public to our public in places to <unk> <unk> from which which they <unk> <unk> from how they saw and, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and we have to find a <unk> of life in the diversity, and we have to find a <unk> life in a <unk> world and <unk>.
where all the <unk> of all the <unk> can <unk> our <unk> <unk>.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope is you've heard and you've been <unk> and <unk> to some <unk>, in the case you don't get them.
I want to start with what I call "the <unk> <unk>."
The <unk> <unk> of what?
The <unk> <unk> of all the society called <unk>. The <unk> <unk> <unk>: "If we want to <unk> the <unk> of our citizens." The way to do it is to <unk> the freedom to do it is <unk>. "
The reason is, on one side, in fact that the freedom is <unk>, in itself a value, is useful, <unk>, human beings.
And the other one is in fact that if we're <unk>, each of us can act to do everything we <unk> our <unk>, without no one that's going to <unk> our <unk>, no one that's going to be in the fact that if we're <unk>, we're all about it.
The way to <unk> the freedom is to <unk> choice.
The more choices, the more choices, they are <unk>, and more their freedom, the greater than their <unk>.
This, <unk>, it's so <unk> <unk> in the society that no one's <unk> to <unk>.
And it's also <unk> <unk> in our lives.
I'm going to show you some examples of what progress made possible.
This is my <unk>. It's not particularly big.
I got a simple note about <unk> to <unk>.
In my <unk>, there are <unk> <unk>, no <unk> the 10 <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and the <unk> <unk> <unk> that you can buy a huge number of <unk> in the <unk> that no one of the <unk> already.
That's what <unk> is what <unk>.
Then you go to the <unk> store to buy a <unk>: <unk>, <unk>, radio, <unk>, radio, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
And in this single store, there's a big number of <unk> <unk>.
We can do six million different <unk> using the <unk> that there are in a only store.
<unk> <unk> that there is <unk>.
<unk> fields: the world of <unk>.
Once, when I was a child, you could get all the services <unk>, to <unk> that were <unk> by <unk> <unk>.
You <unk> the phone, you don't <unk>.
And a <unk> of that, by the way, was that the phone you never <unk>.
These days, they went.
We now have a <unk> <unk> <unk>, especially <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
Here's the mobile phones.
My <unk> is in the middle, <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and <unk> for <unk> <unk>.
If you don't have it yet seen in the <unk> store, you're quite sure soon you're going to see.
And what happens is that people <unk> in <unk> and does this question. And you know, what's the answer is, "No.
It's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn't do things.
So, in other <unk> of life that are much more important than <unk>, you get the same <unk> of choices.
<unk> <unk>: It doesn't happen in the United States you're going to go from <unk> and the <unk> you what you have to do.
Instead, <unk> by <unk>, and the <unk> says, "OK, you could do it. Or you know," A, "or <unk>," A has these <unk> and these <unk>.
You asked them, "<unk>, what would you do?"
And the <unk> says, "A has these <unk> and these <unk>, and <unk> has these <unk> and these <unk>."
"What do you want to do?"
And you said, "<unk> if she was me, what would you say?"
And the <unk>: "But I'm not her."
And the result we call the <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk> that makes it look like a thing.
But actually, it's not that a <unk> the weight and the responsibility of making somebody that something knows something, <unk> the <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and of course, is not <unk> -- and it's certainly not <unk> to make the patient.
There's a huge <unk> of <unk>, <unk> to people like me and you, that if you think if you think about it doesn't make sense, because we can't <unk>.
But if we can't <unk>, why do we <unk> them?
The answer is they want to say that they're <unk>, we call the <unk> to <unk> the <unk>.
And so it's how we've been so fundamental, is a question of choice, how you see in this <unk>. "We don't want to <unk> children. We don't want to <unk> the children. They are <unk> at the right now.
And we can <unk> how many times we'll get there.
which means that any <unk>, <unk>, you have to decide what you want to be.
I <unk> to the family and <unk>, a time perspective, that was that you were <unk> to anyone, was that you were <unk> the <unk> as possible, and they were <unk> to <unk> the <unk> as possible.
The only real choice was with who, not when, and even even what to do later.
<unk>, everything is really to play.
They're going to be very smart students, and they <unk> them 20 percent less than work at a time.
And not because they're less <unk>, not because they're less <unk>.
But why I'm <unk>, I'm going to try to ask, "<unk> or not?"
"<unk> <unk>, I've got to think about children or <unk>?"
They're <unk> <unk>.
And they try to answer these questions, even if this <unk> didn't have to <unk> the <unk> that they would not get the <unk> <unk> to my <unk>.
And they have to do that. They're important questions.
Now, the work is: we're <unk>, as <unk> <unk>, because technology <unk> us to work every minute, every day, from every corner of the planet, that from the <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, there's a <unk>, and I'm not going to say that nobody, where the <unk> works.
I'm not saying that because I want to use it.
What does this mean, this incredible freedom to choice that we have about the work? Is we going to decide, <unk> at any time, if we have to work or not.
We can go to see our son to play <unk>, with the cell phone in a <unk>, the other way, and the <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
And even if I'm all <unk>, every minute we see our son, I'm also going to say, "Do we have to answer this call?"
"I have to answer this <unk>? I have to <unk> this letter?"
And even when the answer is, "not," that makes your <unk> experience your son very different from what would be in other conditions.
So, from any part of us, look at, small things, and big objects of life, life is a question of choices.
Once the world was this: <unk>, there were some possibilities, but it wasn't about choice.
The world of today, I'm going to talk about this: The <unk> is a <unk> thing, or <unk>?
The answer is <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> we know, we all, so I'll talk about the <unk>.
We have this choice is two effects of two <unk> people.
The first one, <unk>, is that it <unk> instead of <unk>.
With a lot of <unk> between which you choose, it becomes very difficult to do that.
I'll give you an example of <unk>: a study <unk> <unk> <unk>.
A <unk> has been <unk> to the <unk> data, <unk> <unk> society, with <unk> <unk>, with about a million <unk> <unk> in <unk> companies.
What she found was that for every 10 solutions that are <unk> to be <unk>, the <unk> of <unk> 2 percent.
With 50 <unk>, there's 10 percent less than <unk>, at least at the time, it's only five.
Because with 50 <unk> <unk>, you know, it's <unk> difficult to decide, and choice is <unk> to <unk>.
And <unk>, and still <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and of course <unk>, it never comes.
It doesn't just mean that these <unk> <unk> <unk> food to <unk> because they don't have enough, it means that the decision is so <unk> that you also have the decision to be so <unk> that they also <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
They're not going to be <unk> to five <unk> <unk> per year from work, which would be well <unk> to <unk>.
So <unk> is a <unk> of having choices.
And I think it's going to be like this.
"And finally, by the <unk>: <unk>, <unk> or <unk>?"
I could just get the right decision, if it's the <unk>, isn't it?
You don't want to choose the wrong <unk>, and you'll get the wrong <unk>.
So this is the first effect. The second is that even if we can <unk> <unk> and make a choice, at the end, we're less <unk> by the <unk> of how you <unk> states with less <unk>.
And this for several reasons.
One of them is that with many <unk> between which, if you take one and it's not perfect, it's easy to imagine that could make a different choice that would have been better. And what's going on is that the <unk> <unk> us to <unk> the choice, and the <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> by the decision,
And when it was a <unk> decision.
More choices there are, easier to <unk> of any <unk> that is <unk> of <unk>.
<unk>, there is what <unk> call.
Dan <unk> has very well <unk> as the value that we give the <unk> things from what we give them.
And you know, when there's a lot of <unk>, it's easy to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and be less than the <unk> <unk>.
So, an example. I'm <unk> with all that I'm not from New York.
But that's what you probably know.
There's this <unk> to <unk>.
A place of <unk>.
<unk> <unk>. <unk> day. It's all about them.
I don't know. But what he thinks is, "Well, <unk>, it's <unk>."
"All my <unk> <unk> are away."
"<unk> <unk> <unk> right in front of the home."
And it's going to be two weeks from the idea that's <unk> -- every day -- the possibility of <unk> where it wants.
<unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> for what we have, even when the choice was <unk>.
And the more the <unk> we have <unk>, the <unk> <unk> us against how to <unk>.
Here's another example.
This <unk> tells us a lot of things.
It's about living the moment, and perhaps, slowly,
But the most important point is that anything you say, you say, you're not doing other.
The things that don't know many <unk> that can make less <unk> what we do.
<unk> <unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk>.
I tried it on my skin, a new <unk>.
I'm going to be <unk>.
Once the <unk> were just a kind, <unk> them and they were <unk>, only after they had to <unk> a life and they were a lot of times, they were going to go well.
So, I went to <unk> a couple of when the <unk> were gone, and I said, "I need a couple of <unk>, this is my <unk>.
The <unk> said, "You want to <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>?"
You want them to <unk> or <unk>? "
"
"<unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk>? <unk> <unk> <unk>," <unk> <unk>. "
I was <unk>, and after a little bit of <unk>, I was like, "I want the only guy that -- that was the only guy." He didn't know what it was, so on a time, I would get <unk>, and then I was <unk> out of the <unk>, and then I was <unk> out of the <unk>, and then I had ever had.
It was the <unk>. With all that choice I had <unk> the best.
But it <unk> me worse.
Why? I wrote a whole book for <unk>.
The reason I was worse is that with all that choice my <unk> were <unk>, the <unk> <unk> to be <unk>.
<unk>, I had <unk> <unk>. I didn't know about <unk> when I just had a guy, but when you had different, it had to be perfect.
What I had <unk> was good, but not perfect.
After I <unk> that I <unk> with what I was <unk> in <unk> to <unk>.
The <unk> of <unk> in life of people don't do <unk> the <unk> that these are <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> themselves.
And this is less <unk>, even when the results are good.
<unk> in the world of <unk>, if you realize it.
Because if I <unk>, I don't know what I'm talking about.
The truth is more to this.
"He was better when he was worse." The reason you know, when you're worse, is, when you were worse was, you know, you could see <unk> <unk>.
<unk>, in the world that we live in -- <unk>, <unk> citizens with the <unk> of <unk> -- the <unk> that we can <unk> is that things are <unk> to the <unk>.
You've never seen <unk> <unk> because your <unk>, my <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
The <unk> of happiness -- what you're here -- is, "<unk> <unk>" Yes, you want. "
I mean, a little bit <unk> -- that I'm really <unk> and my wife is really <unk>.
I couldn't do better, I didn't have to do that.
But <unk> don't always know.
I mean, a <unk> of <unk> <unk> when you have that you're just like that <unk> is that when you're not <unk>, and you say, "Why?"
"Who is <unk>?", "the answer is <unk>.
The world is <unk>. What could I do do?
When there are hundreds of <unk>, and you'll give you a <unk>, and you'll tell you who is the <unk>, it's clear that the <unk> you are.
I could do better.
With hundreds of <unk> available, there are not <unk> for <unk>.
So when people make decisions, even if the result is <unk>, you get <unk> and give them the <unk> to them.
In the last few years, the <unk> is <unk> in the world.
I think a <unk> <unk> -- not the only, but important -- of this <unk> <unk> is that people have experiences because the standard are too <unk>.
And when they have to <unk> that they think <unk> is them.
So the end result is that in general is that we're better, we're better, we're going to get worse.
<unk> you.
This is the <unk> <unk>, what we all take for good and it's completely <unk>.
There's no <unk> that a little bit of choice is better than you don't know much choice. But that's not a lot of choice is better than a little bit.
There's a <unk> value, <unk>. I don't know what it is.
But I'm quite sure we've been <unk> by a piece of the level where the choices are <unk> our life.
Now, from a <unk>'s point of view -- I almost finished -- from the point of view, the <unk> is <unk>.
What allows all this choice to society is the <unk> material.
There are many places in the world, and you know, you know, where the problem is not they have <unk> choice.
The problem is that they have too <unk>.
So the <unk> that I'm talking about is a <unk> <unk>, <unk> society.
And what <unk> does and <unk> is this: <unk> <unk> <unk> you've talked yesterday about how much those <unk> and <unk> <unk> to <unk> are <unk>. It's a <unk> of money.
I mean that these choices, <unk> and <unk>, is not just <unk>.
They're <unk> <unk>.
They make us worse.
If a little bit of what we were in our society allows choice to be <unk> in the where people are too few possibilities, it would not just their life to <unk>, but also our.
This is what <unk> call a <unk> <unk>.
A <unk> of income is good at all -- not just to the poor people -- because of this choice in <unk> that we <unk>.
And so, you know, you can become everything you want to be --
<unk>, people of culture, <unk>, "What would you take that fish?"
"It's <unk> that you can't do anything in a glass <unk>."
"A <unk>, a <unk> view of the world --
and I <unk> it like this, at the beginning.
But then, <unk>, instead, I realized that that fish knows that that fish knows the long time.
Because the reality of <unk> is that if you <unk> the <unk>, so that "is," you can't <unk> the freedom. You <unk> the <unk>.
If you look at the <unk> so that it could be possible to <unk> the <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, and they <unk> the <unk>.
Everybody needs a <unk>.
This is almost certainly too <unk>, maybe even for the fish, and certainly for us.
But the <unk> of a few <unk> <unk> is a <unk> for <unk> and, <unk>, for <unk>.
Thank you.
