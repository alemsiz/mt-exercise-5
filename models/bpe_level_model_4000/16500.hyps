And last year I showed these slides to show that the slide of the glacial heat at that the glacial scale of the 48 U.S. has been the size of 48 United States, you have a 408 U.S.
But this underpushed the gravity of the problem because it doesn't show the ice of the ice problem --
The glacial calotic heat is a certain sense, the heart heart heart of the global climate system.
You expanding and the sumption and the sumption of the summer and the sumption of the sumption of the sumption and it return it into the sumption and the sumption of the sumption and the sumption of the sumption and the summit.
The next devices will be a quick carrelled suddens of the last 25 years.
The ice lost of the ice lost of the red are signed in the red red red red.
And as you see, they expanding up to the blue scuron blue scurod.
That's the ice in the inversus in the summer that is return into the sumption of the summer in the summer --
You can see the perennal cosident ice as a blood of five years or more, is like the blood of the body.
In 25 years is spent by this way.
This is a problem because the interesting scale of the interesting land land land land land where there are huge amount of carbon on on the ocean where there are huge amount of carbon that that that moves us a microbes.
It turns out to the totality of the atmospheroes of global warming, that amount could double, super-scale of this point of the unless that report.
In some deep lagenses in Alaska the metan is already rebolling from water.
The professorse Katey Walter in the University of Alaska was rected with a team -- a basement last last device.
Video: Wow! Wow! Gor: You are all all the time. The question is if we are also going to be us.
And a reason is that this extraordinarily warming the Groenland,
This is a glacial fighting a glacial fire.
The laughed never to the levels a million side.
This is the fume Kangerlussuaq, in the sound of the Groenland Groenland,
If you want to know how the sea level of the sea ice of the sea ice of the sea in the ground, here is where the sea.
These are increasing up very quickly.
Another part of the planet: Again, the largest block of the planet.
The month scientists have deployees that the ice of the ice is in negative, and that the Antarctical Western on some of the underwater on some of the underwater on some underwater issues on the leavery.
And it was six feet of water -- like in Groenland, like in Groenland,
Himalaya, the third largest block of ice block -- you see new laghi, and they were glaciers.
40s of the world's population was going to be half of the water water from the monkey.
Sulle Ande: this ice is the bottom of the water water of this cities.
The lady is increasing.
But when he diminures the same thing happens.
In California news on the Sierra Nevada is deminured by 40-percent.
The hydrogen are in the crisis.
The previsions, like you have graves.
The growing search in the world leads to a nice of the world leads to a prevent sea a making.
The environmental disasters are increasing up to a return out of the normal and unprecedents.
Four most numbers in the last 30 years of the previous precedented 75.
This is a whole thing that is a whole thing that was sustainable.
If you look at the historical context if you can see the consequences.
In the last five years we have added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the oceans every day.
Look at the area of the Pacification of the Pacific, from Americh, and on the west, and on the subcontinent -- where there's a radical rooxiges in the oceans.
The greatest because of the global warming and deforestation, which is 20-percent, which is the 20, is the use of fossil fuel fuel fuel fuel fuels.
oil is a problem, and the carbon is even worse about.
The United States are one of the two countries with the most emissions, together to China.
And it was proponding a lot of the carbon on on the carbon of the carbon diding.
But we're assisting to a change in direction.
These are the projects of the last years and some alternative propositions of alternative way.
Anyway, there's a political lotta in our country.
The carbon and oil industry has spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promoting carbon on the last year to promote carbon -- which is a oxymore.
That image me to me somewhere --
Veras Natral in Tennessee, where there was a 3.8 billion pounds of carbon dishes.
Maybe you saw it on the news of the news
This is the second largest flow of scale in America.
It happened around Natal.
The carbon publishing of the carbon industry was this way.
Video: Frosty the carbon is a coal kind of halleat is a kind of halleat is a kind of snake.
It's abundant here in America, and it makes our economy.
Frosty the carbon is always more cleaner and more cleaner and more cleaner and more cleaner and more cleaner is always cleaner it.
It's a good price, adorables, and the work work sends and the work sending the site the stair.
Al Gore: From here is a lot of the West Virginia.
The largest society on the mountain in is Massey Coal. This is his ministerary
Video: Don Blland, I was clearly -- I was very clear -- Al Gore Nancy Peies, Harry Reid -- not know what they're talking about.
Al Gore: So the Alleance for the Clim Proteping two campaign.
This is a bit, a wheat the way.
Video: Attor: The COALergives we see the climate changes like a sery seria at our business.
So that our priority is to invest a big amount of money in a high high high for the public and consumption to make public and consumption.
In fact, the carbon is not sport.
We think it's cleaned -- has a good profum.
So not predicted: that doesn't prehot.
Let me do it for us.
Video: Attor: Carbon pulls -- you heard a lot of the slady -- you heard a lot of the lady -- you heard a lot of the lad: Attor: The lememploy.
So let's do it a structure in a structure of the structure of the fuel of the fuel of the fuel of the fuel of the fuel of the fuel of the fuel of the fuel of the fuel of the fuel of the fuel of the fuel of the fuel of the coal structure.
Straordinary! The machines are a little roundarious, but this is the sound of the carbon technology of carbon technology.
The carbon is between the main the main the global warming cause, but the night technology of the carbon clean that you can see it all over the time.
To an eye -- this is the odiernative technology.
Al Gore: Infinally, the positive alternative to the issues of the issues of the national surely and the national security.
Video: Comment: America is in crisi; the America is the national security economy, the national climate crisis.
The film that the whole whole lines that the whole coal combusters and the fuel oil and oil oil oil oil and oil oil oil oil and oil oil oil oil
Now, yeah, there's a new new sun for ushing circle for uses.
Repower America: 100percent of clean energy in 10 years.
A plan to reput America to work, make us sure it seververal and help to stop the global warming.
Finally, a solution that basts to solve our problems.
No America. Scover more than that.
Al Gore: This is the last last
Video: Comment: It's about repower to America.
One of the fastest ways of the dependence from the dependence to the dependence from the fuel of the way that we kills our planet.
Comparsa: The future is here. Vento, just a new network of energy.
You know, 2: 2: Novi investment for places for good jobs.
Comment: Repower America. It's time of being realists.
Al Gore: A proverbio African old proverbio say, "If you want to go speed by the money
If you want to go away away from the round."
We have to go away away very quickly.
Thank you very much.
Last year at TED I did a TED introduction on the LHC.
And I promise to go back to you to the way to go back to how the machine.
So I mean, you get the other time I don't have to be the largest scientific experiment, the largest scientific experiment, or a mile of circence.
His the compit of reaction that were less than a billions of a billion, by the beginning of the universe -- until 600 million times a second.
All is just the environment.
This is the car below the car in the Ginevan.
We do these minds Most Bang in the detectors.
This is what I work.
This is an ATLATLATLAS in built so you can notice the proportions.
Ten secember 10 sects of the last year we have acceso the machine for the first time.
And this picture was taken by ATLATLATLATLATLAS:
It was because of immense in the room in the room room of control.
This is a picture of the first fashion particles that had done all the LHC, ently deliberately, with a part of the LHC, and deliberating, and debing inside the reach.
In other words, when we saw that 10 secembes, we could see that the machine was a big living, which is a great living.
I don't know if it was to do us exact more than that, when somebody went on Google and vide that the universe was this --
That means that we have a cultural impact cultural impact on the scientific impact on the scientific impact of the scientific impact of the cultural impact on the scientific impact of the cultural impact beyond in the scientific impact of the scientific impact of the cultural impact of the scientific impact cultural impact of the cultural impact of the cultural impact of the scientific impact of the cultural impact
About a week later, there was a problem with the machine, because it was just to these films here -- these files -- these films -- these files -- these films -- these files -- these films -- these files -- these files -- these files -- these files -- these films of the machines.
These files bring 13,000 prints when the machine works, the mesthium of the power of power.
Now, the technical of you look at the films and dirank it and dirank it doesn't be there. I'm not very much.
And they can do it because when they're very fresh co-free films.
So, at least 271 degrees, a inferior in the spaces of the spaces of the spaces can bring that the current cutting that current celebration to the current temperature to the stellow in the starts to the space.
In one of the handed honest in the LHC, there was a defection of the LHC, there was a defection of factory fabrication.
So the films surprising films that they would have a 3,000 amps suddenly meet a electrical resistance.
This was the result.
Now, this is even more impressive, if you think these magnets, the most of 20 tons of the most tons of the land land of 30 centimeters.
They are damamong about 50 magnets.
We had to leave them to the things that we did it.
We have repristined and the coust.
Now they're return back to their underneying all of the subject.
By the end of the LHC will be new inteam.
And I accenderem, and we expect to get the right or to get the right or him, and continue to find out what the way our avventure avventure the universe.
Now, of course, in a certain quest of the way, these flums reaccendate the debate on the values of science and engineering the science and engineering the engineering of the science and engineering it.
I think the fact that it's so hardly to go over the limits, I think this is the valuable of things like LHC.
I would like to end with a scientist, Humphrey Davy, the quality, Humphrey Davy, the image, image, in the ineating inuseful experiments of his puzzle was Michael Farady, he said, "Nident" is a dangerous for the progress of human mind as the idea of human mind that we don't have a little bit of the ideas that we don't have a mysteries in nature that there are no new money, our tries that not not the world."
Thank you.
I want to start asking you to rethink about how to do you get the kids, you played the morning.
And as you go to the way and reach them and to make them and move them and move them and move it to the problem and solve problems and a whole way and a space relations and spaces.
The space is propushing is deeply connected to the world of the world around us.
So, by informath inspired by the useful of our interaction with physical objects with my Pac, and my collaborator, and my collaborator, and my collaborators to be able to asking. And when we use a computer, instead of having the only one computer, instead of having the only one computer, instead of a digital mouse that it will be able to be a physical information to be able to be a information to ramework with a certain certain information with the manages,
and to the system, our pleasure to our pleasure to the pleasure to the system?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer, building the answer, building the Siftable.
In a few words, a Siftable is a whole computer -- like a biscood.
In a few words, a Siftable is a whole computer -- like a biscood.
You can move with the hand the hand it can see the right motion of them movement and a radio wireless and a radio wireless radio wireless and radio wireless to
But extreme is physical objects like the morning, you can just move on the morning.
The Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem to manipulate information digital information.
And as they become more physicists, you know, the way that they get more physicists of the movement, others, and as they get seververal of the movement, and others, how to move them and the other fun and funny stils of interaction.
I'm going to start with some simple example.
This Siftable is configured to show of the video: if you win a direction, the video rotate right now, if you walk on the other side side the other side side the other side side side side of the back.
These interactive interactive of the other other people have to the other way.
If you say that, you are interested in what they are interested in what they winting.
If they come up and they can get a little bit and they can get a little bit of it.
If they come up and they can get a little bit and they can get a little bit of it.
They also have their movement and the motion and including it.
We then realized that one of the interesting interesting interesting is that one of the interaction was to use community to use the community of the object like it was a liquid.
In this case, we have three Siftable configured as a wind wind walls and I can use them to the color in the middle of that color in the middle of that they miss miles.
and I can use them to use it to be in the middle of that color in the middle of that the color in the middle of the color in the middle of that color in the middle of that color in the middle of that color in the middle of the color in the middle of the color in the middle of that color in the middle of that you miles to use
If we are too too much, we can remit a little bit of it.
I'm also a beautiful chance of applying langues, like languages, the mathematics and the mathematics of the people can try and see the results.
Now I'm --
This is a Fibonaces that I do with a Redwonaces program.
Here we have a words that is in the Scarabeo and Boggle.
Orrrly, every turning of the literal case, in every Siftable, Prratic -- every turning of every turning of any sweet in every Siftable, and how to make words he controlled a dictionary.
And then after about 30 seconds remiss remiss and a new set of reading and new chance to try and new chance to try to be able to try to be able to be able to be able to be remissing and new chance to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be remissed.
Thank you.
Here are the children in the Media Lab, I did it in Lab, I did it and I did it and I took a video of the video.
They are pleasure a lot of the way a lot of the way.
And one of the interesting things of this kind of application is that you don't have to give people a lot of educational educations.
You just say, "He," and they know the wordsite and they know what to do.
That's what other people that they try it.
This is our young head of the young head of the young miles.
It was actually just going to take a cutting them.
They were just morning, for him.
Now, this is an application of a cartoon interactive cards.
We wanted to build a tool for the apprinting the lingwide.
It can put new characters in the scene, solliant their associated with their associated with their associated with it.
It can put new characters in the scene, solliant their associated with their associated with their associated with it.
So it's doing it out of the sun --
Video: The sole is surging.
David Merrill: Now it brought a treat the scene.
Video: The treatment treatment.
Bel worko!
So schooling Siftable and put them close to the close can make the characters --
Video: Bau!
-- by the way to be inventing their story.
Video: Hell!
DM: It's a story with open open up and it can decide him like it.
DM: It's a story with open open up and it can decide him like it.
Video: Gulvia, gact.
DM: The last example I have time to show you is a tool, I did a tool, I did a switching and exeguing music.
It's a tool, I realized recently, to sampling and exeguing and exeguing music.
Siftable here are acting by supplies like base, and bacteria --
Every one of these has four different variations, and you can choose what we use it.
You can insert these sound sounds in a sequence to be to be to be to get to the feet of your pleasure in a sequence of the sound of the sound that way.
And it just just to make it a sound sounds a sound of the sound of the sound of the sequence."
These are actually actually that you can control from the lives and the filter and the filter and the filter and the filter and the too much of the film.
The attacks to a particular suit and then including the sous.
And then there are the effects like time and flighting it in the whole sequence.
Let's look at how it works.
Video: Spush we will put a basic in two Siftable "sequency," we go into a series, the extreme the other base.
Now I put a bunch line.
Video: DM: Now I added percent use --
Video: DM: And now I'll put the bacteria, so I can control the effect of the live.
Video: DM: I can speak the whole whole sequence on the time from a late or from the other.
Video: DM: And now add the filtrum, to give the bottom of a lower to make more expression.
Video: I can recombined the sequence ""Would you recombined the volund."
So I don't have to plan it before, but I can sudden, it can make it longer longer or more cortex.
And now, finally, I can go to the whole whole sequence on the left the Siftable to the left the Siftable "volume."
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is to build new interfaces man-machine man-machine is to build a brain and body.
And today, I had time to show you one of the results of this lost and also some possibilities that we try to bring out of the lab.
The concept I want to turn you to the new generation of the design objects that we want to interact with digital media media that will bring information in our world in the way we want to do it in the way we want to be able to be that we want to get this new generation of the world that we want to turn this new generation of the world that we want to get this new generation of the world that we want to get this new generation of the things we want to be to be
Thank you very much.
I don't see the time to talk to all of you.
I'm a writing writing a writer.
And I mean, I want to be my professional exsion is more than that, of course, is that obviously.
It's also love and the fall of my life.
And I don't expect that can change it.
But I said that, something particularly happened in my life and in my life and in my life and in my life and I was brought to resmart me to report the entire relationship to work.
The particular thing is that I have recently recently wrote this biography called "Mangia, Prega, Prega, Ama" the quality, and so much of my books, and it became a big.
And the result is that everywhere it is now the people treat me like I was condaming.
It is true -- condanning -- condannat!
They go from me now all worried and say, "You don't fear you don't fear to do better.
You don't fear to keep writing for the whole life without that we could make a book that could be able to make a book that could important to somebody?"
that could matter somebody?"
It's rassicurants, you know.
But it could go worse -- I remember that more than 20 years ago, when I started to tell people -- I was a writing adolescent -- I was a writing writing.
I was in the same based on the foundation of the land.
And people say, "Don't you know, I don't have to have to have success?
You don't fear that the hummmor kill?
You don't fear to do this mestize for all life without anything that is ever outside and die on a heart of samp samp of saming with the mestening energy.
So I mean, you know.
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is: "Yes."
I am papers of all those things.
I always had land.
And I also have a lot of other things that people could not have to be inject.
As the algand other things that I'm going to be in the way.
But as I was about about the writing what I thought and I was asking me the ultimtimate is be?
Is it rational?
It's logic that anyone who should be spent a job that you feel about to be a job that for a job that to do.
But what is there is so particularly in the creative impreventional creative to make us about the minute of the mental health in a way that other careful to not fan?
And as my father, for example, he was a chemical engineer and not remember one time in his 40 years of activity where he was asked if he was asked if he was asked if he was asked if he was asked if he was to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be to be engineer to be to do that?
There was no -- that block of the John, how would you walk up the John, how would you?
It wasn't going to work.
Only, chemicales like group don't have certainly in the several sees, and the reputation of being alcolized by a depressive.
We write about this reputation and not only writers but creatives of every general generation, we have this reputation of being enormously initially instable to mentals.
And not another one that look at the dead of the death of the death of the magnificent death that creative that only in the 2th century, they die young and often to them.
And the ones that are not suicide seem to be really discovery --
Norman Mailer, before Mailer, in the last interview, he said, "I'm going to kill me a little bit more than a laptop.
But we don't drink it when we feel like to say because we heard these things that are so much long, and the argument that creativity and the creativity that creativity and the art, and the art, and the art, and the art, and the art, and the art, and the art, and the art, and the art, and the art, and the art, and the art, and the art, and the art, and the art, and the art,
And the question I want to bring to all of this is: are you agree with this idea?
And it is good for you -- because you look at a hundred of distance to me not be good for this supposition.
I think it's odied.
And I think it's also dangerous, and I don't want to see the perpetuated in the next century.
I think it's better to encourage our great creative minds.
And certainly I know that, in my case -- in my case -- would be very dangerous to start to commoditizing the constants, especially the circumstances where I are in my careful carefull.
Obbbb, I'm quite a young -- I have about 40 years.
I still have about four decade in my work in me.
And it's very likely that everything to write it will be right now in the world will be judged by the world as the work that did after my last book.
I'm going to slavery, because we all are more or not friends here -- is likely to my greatest -- is the largest thing to my shoulders.
Oh, Gesood, which think!
You know this is the kind of thinking that leads a person to start to start be, and I don't want to do it.
I would just continue to do this work that we do.
So the question becomes it becomes it there?
And so I would seed me after a lot of reflectors, that the way to work to write is to create a structure.
I have a few way to find a safety distance between me, that I'm writing and my natural natural analysis on which reaction to get it in the last year models on how to do it starts to look through the time, trying to find other societies to see other societies that if they could have the best ideas and more healthy and more health ideas and more healthespecially and more health ideas and more healthy and more healthy and the best things to see if you can start to look at the whole thing
to help people create creative to manage the people creative risks of creativity.
And that research me brought me to the Greek and the old old old old and the old old old old and the old old old old old and the old old old old and the old old old old and the old old Room.
You can go back to the circle and then you get back.
In the Greek and the old old Roma -- people didn't seem to believe that creativity sevenuity came to man?
It was thinking that creativity was this spirit spirit and that came to man, and that came out of a few surprising and unknown and unknown and unknown and unknown and unknown and unknown and unknown and unknown and unknown and the unknown and the unknown and the knowledge.
The green were called these spirits of the creativity of creativity of creativity of creativity.
Socrrusly, he created a demone that elargives from the mogeon from the most.
The Romans were of the same idea, but they were called that kind of spirit without a genium.
The one is great, because the Romanannows, they didn't really think a genius was a particularly smart genium, because the Romans, the Romanannows.
They thought that a genius was this sort of divine that created created in the study of the study of a artist, a little bit like the elf's elf's wide, and who came up to assisting the work of the artist of the artist and the result of that work.
And there is a very -- -- -- -- that is the distance of what I talk -- that psychological that that has protected psychological that protects you have to be in your work.
And everybody knew that was so that it was so that it worked, right?
So the anti-who were propers of certain things, like the too narcixism, right?
If your work was exceptional you couldn't take it all the dead of the death that it was helped by this incorporea.
If your work fail, it wasn't all of the whole bunch of ture, right?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be a inable incapable to be a inable to be a inable to be a inable to be a inable to be a inable to be a inabout.
And so the people han an concepts the creativity for a long time.
And then the Rindicates came and everything changed and it changed this great ideas; we put the human beings in the middle of the universe and the mysteries and mysteries that write the creatures that write devices to the creatures that address from device.
This was the principle of the rational human rational and people started thinking that creativity creativity was completely completely from the ified.
And for the first time in history, you start to referred this or a genius like a genius of a rather than a person with a genium.
And I have to tell you, I think it was a big mistake.
I think allow somebody, a simple person to believe that being like a recipe of creating as a recipe of all mysteries of all mysteries in and etherals are a responsibility to the fragile a very much too big to make a filter too much of a human to make a human that human being.
It's like to ask someone to ingoid the sole.
It deforms the whole ego and creates all these ingestible ingestive on the losts of the loss.
And I think it was this pressure that we've been destructed the artists in the past-year-old artists in the past.
And if this is true, and I think that it is it becoming it, and hold it it becomes now?
Can we do it different?
And as you go back to a understanding the most ancient understanding of the relationship between human and creative mystery.
Or perhaps not.
Maybe we can't get 500 years of rational thinking about a structural thinking.
And probably people in the audience that would like to sollise a bunch of scientific suspects on the notion of the notion of the notion of the same time.
You probably don't know you know that all about this thing.
But the question I would like to bring is -- because right?
Why don't you think about it in this way?
Because it has more sense of any other thing that has ever heard to explain the asperformer of creative process.
One thing that I ever tried to do something -- so, fundamentally, all here -- yeah, all here -- yeah.
And in fact, it can look at completely paranorms.
I did this recently recently with the Ruth poetc. And it was now 90 years old, but that was a poetc. And he was a poetrural. And he was working out in the widea, and he was working out in the wall, when a poem in the camps, and he was feeling in the wall, when a poem of the landscapture.
He said it was like a fragorous fragorous training track.
And he was rolling roundating into her from the landscape.
And it was to get to the land below his feet under his feet.
He knew that I have a only thing to do that point and it was words like a a morning."
And it was going to go home and came to the poems of this poetry and a little piece of card's carding, and a pretty quickly fairly in the road and it it will make it and the mistakes, and it on the page.
Sometimes it doesn't be quite quickly as it recorrect and correct it and the correcent and the poem was rooled through and she was the rolled and she was going to stay through the landscape, and then it was going to stay through the landscape, as she said, "another poet."
And then there were those times -- this piece of not forgotten -- there were moments in which was almost lost loss in that that was almost los?
So it was going to go home and was looking at the card and the careful were, and he was going to be in the while he was going to stand and then he said it was like to hand the other hand the other hand the other hand the off.
And he was offered the poem of the code and put it into his body and the reveal on the page.
And in these cases, the poetry would be presented on the perfect page, and the last word at the last word at the last word at the last word at the last word at the last word at the last word at the last word at the last word at the last word at the last word at the last word at the last word at the last word of the last word at the last word of the last word of the last word of the last few of the last word
So when you feel like you think -- is crazy -- is exactly the equals to my creative process.
Nothing all my creative process. I'm not a conducture!
I'm a mul, and my way to work is -- I sweet it to be on the same orary every day and work and get it over the way and get it over the time.
But even I was in my head in the tagge, I sheat that stuff, and you just just like this.
And I imagine that many of you have the han of you do it.
You know, even if the work and the ideas came to me from a certain fountained certain sources I couldn't lost it.
And what is this thing about that?
And how can we relate to it it in a way to not lose the head -- pluttoster it doesn't lose the head of the souther?
So the best example of me -- the best example I have is the best example I have is the musician in Tom Waits, which I interviewed it a journey.
We were talking about that, and you know, Tom, for the majority of life was the incarnation of the articket in the argument of the argument of the implating these kinds of pulsizes of the implements of the human beorders.
But then I agreed that, and a day while was driving on a day in Los Angeles, he changed everything for him.
It was going to fast and all of a train this little framework of betwewewearing and the wish is to the inspiration, elusive, and and it doesn't want to be wonderful, you know, it's wonderful and the wish wish and the wish wish -- and it doesn't know how to take it.
It doesn't have a piece of card, it doesn't have a matite, it doesn't have a record record.
So he starts to feel this sort of old anxide to grow in him and sessed by this seeds to lose and remarrying obsessed by this lost song.
I'm not good enough and I can't do it."
And instead of going to go into the panic stop.
And I die the whole process of mental process.
And I'm just going to look at the sky and said, "You know, I'm not seeing that I'm driving it?
"You look like that it can write a song of the hanan?
If you really want to exist, you get a more opport, you can take care of you.
Of course, you go to the other today,
You go to the Leonard Cohen."
And his work changed process.
I don't work that work was even dark as you would have a very good time.
But the process, and the heavy rushed it was released when the genius was released when the genius came to the other problems and free it stay back to where it was going to be a whole thing and the remaining and free it was a whole thing and the remained it and free it was a whole thing and the remained it and the reports of the things that we had to be a whole thing and free that was going to
but he weled this peculiar bizar, wonderful bizarzing a conversation between Tom.
So how the story that it began to change a little bit that I was working and I had already saved a time.
This idea, I was saved when I was writing "Mangia, Prega, Prega, and falls in one of the disperation where we all all when we go all all when we are working on something and we don't start to think that it will be the worse -- that that will be the worse I ever written a worse --
Not just good at the worst book written a written written a book
And I started to think about throwing this project.
But then I remember Tom I was Tom parking and it comes to us and try it.
So I alzed my face in the hand-up and direct my comments to a vacuum of the room.
And I told you, "You know, you know, you know, I mean, you know that if this book is not going to be brilliant not really that it will be brilliant, right?
Because as I see that I'm going to put us all that I don't have more than that.
So if you want to be better than you have to introduce you and do your side.
Okay. But if you don't do it it doesn't do it all doesn't do it anything.
I'm going to write the same because it's my work.
And I would like to favor that was recorded to do my part," because -- the end is what I was like to do my part." And it is in the North Africa -- the deserts of the North Africa people were going to be a long dance, and music, and music, and music and music, and music sic sacred to the albe.
And they were always magnificent magnificent because the dances were fantastic and were fantastic and were fantastic and were fantastic.
But every one of these artists had something happened, and one of these artists became actually translate really transendant.
And I know what I talk about what I talk about, because I know you all have to a certain point, a lost of them like this.
It was like the time you stop and the ballery walk through a kind of portal portral and was not doing anything different from the sun, as the 1,000 nights -- but everything you get it to the only one of the ball of the southern --
And suddenly it doesn't just like a human like a human human being.
But you accepty it into the devices in the devince of divinity.
And when this next -- and I had to the time -- people knew what it was -- they call it his name.
They were the hands and started to cant, "Allah, Allah, God God, God God, God God, God."
That's God, you know it.
And I was a storytelling the historical of the Spage of Spaper of the Spaper was to be used to be in the century of the Spaper h." Oh, he was in the middle in the board, "Oh, yeah. ," which you can hear in the corries or in the corries or in the famens.
In Spay, when a artist has done something impossible and magic -- "Allah, you know, Lah, magnifi, you know, the argument -- a flew of God.
And it's great. because we have to have it need.
But the problem comes the next day later, for the ballerin the same, when you wake up and the discover that are the 11 in the morning, the Dod is not anymore.
It's just a dead of a great male to the knees and perhaps not will be able to the alteach that altea --
And perhaps nobody will be the name of God still as the rest of his lives on the rest of his live?
It's hard.
This is one of the most painfinfected to make a creative life in a creative life --
But perhaps not to be so angohing if you can not believe that, as the most extraordinary aspects of your being come from you to yourself.
But I just believe that there are data in the prestained by a imaginable imaginable of this team of your life that you have to get anybody else that you have finished.
And, you know, if we think in this way it changes.
And so I started to think about it, and it's certainly as I thought for several months during the work, the last few months in the book that I will have a very dangerous success.
And what I have to continue to tell me when I feel elemented by this is, not landscape.
Not just just your work.
And he presents to presents for your parts, whatever it can be.
If your work is balling, bally.
If the divin, I assurging genius decided to leave some of wonderful -- for a few of wonderful for a time through your tubes of wonderful for your sford; then "O!"
Some of the same way you do the right now.
And "Ok!" I don't like that.
I think I think you should teach it.
"Ok!" in the samor just for the human and the provided human and testing talks to do it all the time.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
And as you know I've been talking about some of these projects on the genome of these projects on the genomes of new genes.
Now we're starting a new percorrecting, we started digitalize the biology and now starting from that digital code we are coming into a new fashion biology, designing and synthesizing life.
We always tried to bring a big questions.
"What is the lives you have something that many biologists I think we have tried to understand a levels.
We tried it different approach, reducing the minimplemented minims.
We're digitalizing by almost 20 years ormas.
When we sequenced the human genome was treating from the analog world of biology to the digital world of the computer.
Now we close to the life, or create a new life to create a digital universe from this digital universe of digital?
This is the map of a small organism, Mycoplasm -- which is the genome genius is the most small genome of those that can authoring in the lab.
And we tried to reduce the genome to create a little smaller to create a little smaller than that.
We are able to eliminate a hundred genes of the genes of about 500 that are here.
But when we look at the metabolic maps to his metabolic maps to the noaddress.
It credit -- this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate it, one to the time, is very unlikely that this can bring a cell cellure.
So we decided that the only only way to progression was synthesizing this romosomes in a way to make the components to bring the components to bring some of these fundamental questions.
And so we started the adventure of the "Can we can synthesizing a chromostly tast?"
Can you make it concern to produce these great molecules that we never did the way to create before we have never been able to create before you do it before you have to create the earth?
And in case it was a chromostly to work a chromost?
A chromostly is just a chemical material chemistry.
The speed that we are able to digitalize life is growing up to return the exponential of the life is growing report.
Our ability to write the genetic code, the progression of slowly, but it's improving better.
And our recent results, the leads the least.
We started more than 15 years ago.
The process has asked a lot of the past, starting with a biothic revision before we started the early experiments.
But we found that synthesizing DNA is very difficult.
There are tens of thousands of the world that make small segments of DNA, the long 30---length of 30 to 50 letters and is a degenerative proces: the most mistakes.
So we had to develop a new method to assembling these frames and correct the mistakes.
And this was our first attempt to start to start to start information digital information, from Phi 174.
It's a little virus that kills bacteria.
We designed the framments, effective reporting the mistakes and get a molecules of DNA of about about about about 5,000 literally.
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemical material materials, and we put it into the bacteria and we put it into this bacteria and to prove this genetic and particles.
The virals have been released by the cells, are back back and they have come back and they have destroyed E.
I talked about recent membrings of the petroping industry said that they have certainly understood that they have certainly comfortable this model.
They have more than you have a lot of you.
We believe that this is a situation where the software actually actually build his own hardware in a biological system.
But we wanted to do the biggest things in the biggest thing.
We wanted to build the entire chromosomes of bacteria --
I'm more than 80 mile of genetic code code code code of genetic code code code of genetic code of genetic code.
So we thought we were building it in the middle of the virus, so that we can change the cassets to understand what the components are the components of a viventional cell.
The design is crucial and if we start with digital information, these have to be very accurated.
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 the standard accuratength of a mistake.
We have discovered that resequencing -- 30 mistakes. If we used that that original sequence we would not be able to do it work.
A part of the process is designing segments to 50 letters that they exploited with all the other segments to build underunits that could be smaller to build underunits that they work together.
We try to address here.
You probably have the lead that we put the flighter the flighters.
Thaten it of this is a genetic code on four literal literally, and T.
Three of those kinds of bits together codifice about 20 adminioid of the adminioid of the ball of the administration for every love of the administration of the lads.
So we can use genetic code to write words, frazing words, thinking.
What we did in the beginning was authographing it.
Some of them have been dolphins from the fact that it was not poems.
We designed these segments for a few just to make them a making.
There are enzymes that reparent them and put them up and put them up and assumption.
And we started assembling the parts, starting with five to seven miles, and then you start with a letter to be able to former sitting to 24 miles of 24 miles to get to 72 letter to get to 72 letter to the literally.
Another we have produced these sitting in the abundance so that we try to sequence that we're trying to create a very robate proception -- as you will see in a minute.
We're trying to automatize the process.
So, this seems the tabellon a basket.
When we get these very long segments of the most of the most directly to the E.
You get to the modern of the molecular biology molecular biology of molecular biology.
So we looked at other mechannels.
We knew about another mechanism called recombination recombination of homology is that in biology is useful to repair the DNA to unize the DNA to unize the DNA to unique to the DNA to be able to unique
Here's an example.
This organism, called the radiococcus radiolast, can absorbed three million rad rad radiation.
You can see in the square the distructures like his tails is going to destroyed.
In 12 -- 24 hours is resembled exactly as it was before.
There are thousands of organisms that have to do it.
These organisms can be able to be able to be able to be able to be complete in the organisms of the organisms can be complete complete complete completely.
They can live under a vacuum.
I'm absolutely sure life exists in space, and you smoph for new rices of water.
And I mean, NASA showed that this avoid showed that this avoid --
This is a picture of the molecules that we built using these processes just using the processes by the design of the design of the inserious design of inserious selselected segments.
The lights it carefully.
This is not been taken with a microscope with a microscope of electron microscope.
It's a molecules that we can see it with a microscope.
These are pictures that they cover a period of about six seconds.
This is the publishing that we did a little time ago.
I'm more than 80,000 lyler code of genetic code code of genetic code code of genetic code of genetic code.
It's the largest molecules ever created by the largest structure.
It's a lot of the high high 300 million million a million ones.
If we go to the stamp with a 10 without spaces, there would like 142 pages just to turn this genetic code to turn this genetic code just to turn this genetic code to be a genetic code of the genetic code just to get this genetic code of the cars of the careful to be with a genetic code of the cards of
Now, how do we work work? How can we activity it work?
Obviously, you get a virus is a game by girls.
It's a little bit more complicated when they use bacteria
It's simplest when it's about the eucariote cells like ourselves, you can just extreme the nuclear and inserirs a little bit of the cloning process of cloning.
In the bacterium is the skin the mosomtion is integrated inside the cell phone, but we have recently showed that we can do a birthday of a cell romosome it to the other and activity to the other and activity and activity it into the cell and the mosomting it into the cell and the mosome, and the mosomtion of the mosomtion is a cell of the cell
We could refit a mountailing from a kind of microbial mosome.
The two are different as the manages from the topis.
We added some genes in the more in a way that we could decide what to choose to the romost.
And then it hasn't hasn't been killing all the protection of the proteins.
And when we put it in the cellula was stupendom -- and you open our graphic graphic graphic -- the new romosomes -- the new romosome it was going to the cell phone.
And we were really thinking that we couldn't go to the land, but we tried to the mostly over there.
This is one of the greatest mechaniss of evolution.
We found that a very much of the way or a second or a third of a third romosomes somewhere to a thousand new trates.
So who think about evolution as a only gene to the time that you have no modife of the biology.
There is a suddens called restripes of restrippes of restrippes.
The romosomes that was in the cellula doesn't have a one.
The cell-tail-tail-tail-tail-tail.
And it turns out the other chromosomes like a summer material as a door or material materials, and we were return with only the cellula and the new romound.
It became blue because of the genes we have inserved.
And in a short lasses of time, all the characteristics of a species have gone lost of the whole new software that in a new software that we inserted in the cell phone.
All the protection is changed, membranes are changed, and when we read the genetic code code as we have transferred the way you have transferred it.
Now, this could look like a genetic alchemical alchemy als, but we can change things in a pretty remarkable things in a pretty remarkable things that are in a pretty remarkable things that we can change things in a pretty replace.
Now, I already explaned that there is no talk about genesis -- but of progress from three million years and a half of evolution, and I said that perhaps we're going to be to create a new version of Cambrian explosion of the Cambrian explosion of this digital process.
Why do I do that?
I think it's obvious enough when we think of our needed to be in our needed remarkable when we think of our needed as we think of our needed enough when we think of our needed remarkable when we think of our needed as we think of our neighbor.
We're going to go from six billion people in the next 40 years.
Just to give an example: I was born in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for each one exist, 40 years, there are going to be four years, there are going to be four years, there are going to be four of them are going to be five-up in the planet for each other.
We're going to have now now now to find food, water and a fresh water and drink medicines, and drink for six billion people.
It's going to be harder to do it for a billion.
We use more than 30 billion carbon carbon of carbon barrels of the olison.
That means a million barrels to a day.
When we try to find biological processes or whatever the kind of process to replate them, it will be a huge challenge.
In the more we have to keep the whole CO2 from these materials that end up into the atmosphere.
On today today because of the scientific discoveries in the world, we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I like to think that are the design components for the future.
The electric industry has only a dozen of components, and think about how many different things are come out of them.
Our limits here are the principles of the biological and our imagination.
Now we have a techniques of the quick methods of synthesization, can create what we call a combinator.
We are able to build a big robot that can produce a million chromosomes a day.
Think of processing these 20 million genes of different genes or to try to optimize the processes to produce eight or drugs, new vaccines, we can change a little theam, and a more biology that in the last 20 years of science.
And it's just a standard selection selection.
We can choose for a chance of surviving, chemistry or carburders.
This is an instantly instantanea of software programmed to be able to sit and design species to be able to sit and design species to the computer.
Well, we don't know how to be going to be a year.
We know exactly what their genetic code code code --
Now we're focusing on the carbons of fourth generation.
You have seen that you go to the ethanol from the grassroom, was a male experiment with a male experiment.
We have carbon on on the third generation that will be going to be the highest zucgar to the highest parore as the either eight or different kinds of throwing kinds of throwing the different kinds of throwing kinds of throwing out of the highest carbon and the highest generation of the highest generation that will be the highest or different than the eighth of the highest generation that will use the highest or different like the highest
But the only way the biology can have a great impact without increasing more than food and limited the cost of food and limited the deal of food and limited it would be transforming the CO2 in material, where we're working for designing cells that can achieve this purposesed, and we have to be able to be able to be able to be able to remaining this in about 18 months.
The light solar solar with CO2 is a metodoor -- but in our discoveries in the world, we found different methods.
This is an organism that we described in 1996.
It Vives in the ocean ocean level of the ocean temperature of the water.
It creates metan from CO2 using idrogle hydrogen molecular energy as a functional sources.
We're trying to understand if we can look at the CO2, which can easily be transported to be transported to be transported that CO2 in carburants, to drive this process.
So short we think that we could be able to increase what the life-based what the life."
Exactly. If you can't do it from TED, where you can?
It would be a main of energy fundament.
And we are working for the same metoes to use the metoes to create vaccines to create vaccines.
You saw this year with the influence, we are always back, and a dollar a dollar when it's about to find the right now.
I think that what you can change in the antician an anticips.
So that's how the future could start to look at the tree of evolution, accelerating the evolution of evolution, accelerating the evolution of eucaries.
We are so much as much as we have to be better.
Our purpose is to make enough to live enough to try to try to make it very much.
First of all you will show you the fastest thing we have to see the most fundamental work that we brought to Microsoft in a almost very much of the dealation is Seadragon.
It's a environmental environment, which you can interact is in the local level that remote with a huge amount of visual data.
Here we're seeing a lot of the gigabyte pictures of digital pictures with a kind of zoom and continue, for a speed bread of bread,
And not that matter how big the amount of information that we see -- how big these things are the big these things that are the big things or the images.
Most of the digital photographs are digital scanning scanning scanning from the Library of Congress, and reenter in the legal legal legacy.
Not a difference because the only thing that the prestations of a system like this is the number of plus in your screen in any moment. It's also a very flexible architecture.
This is a book inter, example of data not images.
This is the Dickens. Every Wonens. Every colonna represents a capitulum.
To show you that this is just about head and not images, we can do something like this, to do a real thing about it, to see that this is a real representation of the head, not a framat.
It could be a little artificial to read a little artificial book.
You don't have the board.
This is a most realistic example of the number of the Guardian.
Every very very image is the beginning of a sea.
And it really gives you the pleasure and the beautiful experience of a real version of a magazine or a a five-to-pose of a very few of a molecules of a a lot of like a multiple of a lot of a lot of a little bit of a a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of it.
We also did something with the corner of this number in the corner of the Guardian.
We created a fashired publishing advertising -- much more than that you use in a normal publishing -- and you put you insert the content of the training content content -- and you inserted the content content in the normal content -- and you put in a very very normal address of the fasulla -- and we put in a very very much more than you use in a normal that you use in a normal resolid -- and we use in a
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile car, you can see here.
Or other models, or the specific techniques that techniques --
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on the screen.
And we hope this gentlemifies to put a few other door and a million people who are not to be necessary.
Of course, the maps is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology.
And on this not to lose time, if you don't say that we have the contribute to the camping.
These are all the streets in the U.S. stropes over an image of NASA.
So now we're going to go to something else.
This is now now that is actually from the vision of the webs; you can go to see it.
This is a project called Photosynth, which fights two different technologies.
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual research to the computer computer computer computer computer made from Noah Snavely, a student of Washington, with the Steve Steve Seitz of Microsoft Research of Microsoft Research Research Research Research Research Research of Microsoft Research Research Researton, with a very interesting student to the computer
And it's from the vision of the web, managed by Seadragon.
You can see it when we do this kind of pattern -- where we can go from an image to the other and having this kind of experience to the other way to have this kind of experience of the plan to the other experience of the way.
But the spacecraft collecectively a image of the images here has actually a meaning.
The algorithms of the computer have recorded these images together, in the computer have recorded these images together, so that the reals that the reals that the reals that the Grassis on the Mountains. And there were a slides. Here are the elements of a slide-of-show of electric and things have all the space.
I don't know if I have time to show you some other environment.
There are some of the most spacessons of space.
I want to spend a part of the original of the Ahotor -- and this is from a previous precedent Photosynthize -- to show you what we did is really work for the first time -- to show you what I think is the very close of this technology, Photosynthosynthosynthose.
We had to worry about the legal aspects and so on.
This is a rebuild of the cattedral of Notther Dame images Flickr Basta digit's Flickr and you get images of types in the camps, other of the campackages and the camps, and you can say, a little bit of these aroundation of the rounds that shape it model.
So I'm all sorts of Flickr and were all related to space in this way.
And it is possible to navigate in this simple way.
You know, I would never have been thought to work for Microsoft's working for Microsoft.
It's very frefflighting this kind of accounting here.
I think you can see that this is a lot of different types of folks from the photos, the phones to the SLR, a a number meaning in this environment.
And if you can try to try and those more strangerous and try and the most strangerous
Many are block of them out of factors.
Some of this is a series of photographs -- there is a series of photographs -- there it is a series of photographs.
This is a poster of the U.N. SSorrate of the correctly.
We can go from the poster to the physics of this environment.
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment. This is now taking data data from all memory of how to apply the ground of the view of how to apply the land of visual data -- and all those data together.
All those pictures become connected together, the greatest things of the way of the sum of the way of the sum of the sum of the sum of the sum of the sum of the sum of the sum of the sum of the sustains.
You have a model of the land of the land that emerges.
Think about this as a promogment of Stephen Lawler on the Earth virtual.
It's something that growing in complexity as the people use it as they use it for the uses for those who uses for the uses of useating with the use.
Their pictures are snapped by inservers by other people.
If anybody is the idea of contrast all these sants say, my names of the nice of the cattle of Nots Dame suddenly resurprising all those dates, and I can use it in the space, in that space, in that space, in that metaphor to the universe and have a whole belse, and you have a social experience of a whole bunch of the type of the type of the type of the type of the type of these type of the type of the kind of resous.
Of course, a consequence of all of this is the extremely elaborated models of every interesting part of the land land doesn't only only only that you see and a million and several memoritaries and a million six, but by the collective memory.
Mille thank you.
Chris Anderson: I realized the beneficial things that your software will have to do is that in a certain point, in the next few years all the other photographs in the world will be in the world or will be connected together?
BAA: Yeah. What is doing is actually discover it.
It's creating hyperlink if you want to do it, with images.
And it's doing it in the bottom of the images.
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the seeds of the seeds of the several information, that many of these images can be in the several information.
As when you do a research of images on the Web, you have a sentence on the page on the page of the photos.
Now, what happens if that picture is connecting all the time.
So the amount of the whole whole connection and the amount of seed that it is really enormous amount of reacting it is a very huge classic of the remarkable red.
CA: Blaise, is really amazing.
BAA: Thank you very much.
One of the main the main when you travels and a delight-to-search research is the living between who didn't forget the antic antic antic whose traditions, between the wind waving the past, the sought in the wind of the plant plants.
You know, the way to think that the Jaguar traveling the Bly Latte, or that the Lattea, or that the Inuit are still colate in Himalaya, the good distances that in Himalaya, the budge of the Dharm of the middle of the public ance, and the idea that the world in the world that the world in that we live not existed in absolute, but it's just a model of reality, but it's a model of reality, but it is just a model of reality,
The consequence of a particular set of adapted choices that our stirts of the stirts of a male of a generation of a lot of generations ago.
And of course, we all share the essential tracts.
Everybody is hidden we all all recome.
We are subjects to start resizes of starting.
We have to addressing the inesorability of death -- so it doesn't surprising and balance --
We've all got a art.
What it is the particular rhythm of the dance of the dance of every culture.
Nothing important that are the last pencian of Borneo, or the follows of the Borneo, or Haiti, or the Haiti, or the Curanderriers of Anyway, the Curandal campellies, or a camelderison, or a camelderison, or a cammellize in the heart of the Wara.
He was my company I was my company I was a month ago, or a month ago, or a wall-halls in the Walls of the world.
All of these populations teaches us that there are other ways of thinking about existing other ways of thinking, other ways of moving in the world.
And if you reflecting a moment, is a concept that can give you hope to be going to be hope.
Inside, the mirring cultures of the world creating a spiritual life and cultural life that has to be the planet and it is important for the planet and it's important for the planet as the planet as a biosphony.
And you can think about this raignant as a a ethnosfer and you can call the ethnosfer of all the concepts, the total of all the concepts, intuitions that are in the human imagination of the consciousness.
The ethnoxisfer is the fantastic patriage of human human human human issue.
It's the symbolds of what we and what we can be in as as a specific species.
And because biosphery was very very much of the biosphers' happened to the eetnos;
No biologist for example, would be that 50 percent of all the species was on the earth of the sumption -- in the sumption -- in the most apocalculation -- in the biological diversity -- and you don't have a little bit of the biological ipottery -- that the cultural ral issues of cultural diversity -- that of cultural diversity -- that of cultural diversity -- that of cultural diversity --
The indicates all of this is, of course, the language of the language of the language of the language of all of this is obviously, of course, the whole language of the language of all of this is obviously.
When you're born 6,000 English on this planet.
A language is not just just by a vocabulary or by a series of gramatics.
A language is the sprap of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the human being.
It's the middle of the animation of every culture, it comes in the world of every cultural cultural world.
Every language is a forest, a sure, a skill, a thinking, a a spiritual ecosystem.
And of those 6,000 langues, as we are sitting in Monterey, at least half of the hang is not more sussurrying in the oreces of the children.
Nothing thing to teach the children, the means that you don't do something that they have already dead, which is already dead, which is already dead,
What is there is more tristuck of being the silency of being the last to talk a language, of being the last to talk a language, of the hang of the hanang of the daughters?
This is that I was the state of somebody in a few of the world every two weeks a couple of weeks a little bit of the last weeks -- every two weeks of a language of an antic language of an antic language.
And I know someone to say, "Is it not the best thing?
The world would not be a better place if we were all the same language would be the same language -- then we talk all yoruba. We talk all yoruba.
We talk about kogies.
You want to be a tract thing that means that we could not talk about their language.
I would like to do a journey through the ethnos' ethnos' --
a little journey in the ethoxide of what we're lost in the above what we're lost lost.
Many of us say that when I say, "different ways of existing different ways of existing existing different ways of exists.
So let's take for example, this bimbbbbbbt Barasana, in Amazony Septemply, that creates the anacony of the late of the late of the late of the lasts of the sought in the slate of the sacries.
It's a popular of a popular that is not to distinguish the blue color, because the celests is identified in the forest, which depends the popular colors.

And it's in these answers that we all have the ability to be what we all have to be what we are. We are a kind of consciouss. And there are great moments.

Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book I hope to call other that you have heard and provided some of the linical lines, in case not we have to do it in the case not notitors.
I would like to start with what I call "the official."
The official official of thing?
The official dog's officer of all the Western industry is a real officer official of all the benefit to be a global citizen."
The reason to stand from a late, in the fact that freedom is in the fact that freedom is pretious, essential for human beings for human beings for human beings to human beings for human beings to human beings is very useful, useful, by a human beings is prettenened in the fact that freedom is in the fact that freedom is in the fact that freedom is in the fact that the freedom is in the fact that fre
And in the other is that if we are free, each of us can act for the way to do everything that mass the benefit for the way of our benefit without any decided to us.
The way to masses the freedom is to be to massizing choice.
More choices people are free, and greater is freedom, and the biggest is their freedom is their freedom --
This is that really, it's so deeply radicted in society that nobody would be able to put it in a two-tootic society.
And it's also deeply root in our lives.
I'm going to show you some examples of what progress has recomfortable progress it possible.
This is my supermarket. It's not particularly great.
I lost a simple note on the conditional conditional conditions.
In my supermarket is 175 conditions, without contacting the 10 variety of the extracts that the 12 acthetic acthes that you can buy to a huge number of constantly constantly that nobody of the 175 ready is a huge of your degree.
Here is the supermarket supermarket.
And then you go to the electric storygen a stere: cassasses, reading the CD, radio, radio, plast, radio, plast, radio plast, the legs.
And in this single single storytelling electronic components is a big number of audience.
We can make six million combinations of different combinations using the components that there are in a only negoties.
You have to admit that there is a lot of choices.
Some of the camp: the world of communications.
Once time, when I was a child, you could get all the phones that were forced phones that were forced by mama Bell.
It was known the phones I didn't buy it out.
One consequence of that, between the other, was that the telephone was that the telephone is that the phone is not a makes.
These themselves are gone.
Now we have a variety of telephones of telephones -- especially between the cellular cells.
Here is the phones of the future.
My favorite is that in the middle MP3, cuts of the hidden of the hidden and foref for the crying.
If you don't have seen it in the storytells you have seen in the case, you're going to be going to get there.
And what the end is that the people are in the negogoments and it does this question and it does this question and it does this question and it does this question "No."
It's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn't do too much things.
So in other aspects of life that are much more important than the water, it is a very much more than the waterfings.
Assistence is not going to happen in the United States you wada that you go from the doctors and the doctors of the dramatically what you have to do.
Instead, you go from the doctor, and the doctor says, "OK, we could do A, or you can do -- "Would you do it, "B" "B" has these benefits and these risks. What do you want to do you to do that?"
You say, "Does it say, "Does I should do that?"
And the doctor says, "A has these benefits and these risks, and Bed these risky."
"What do you want to do about that?"
And you reble: "Does if she was like to do that?"
And the doctor, "But I'm not leies."
The result of the malator we call the malator of malato," expression that it does it seem a beautiful thing.
But it is not that one to move the fish and the responsibility of taking decisions that something, which is housing something, which is the doctor, and almost certainly it is not not to have to be afraid to make the eggling patient.
There is a huge marketing marketing products of drugs, direct people like me and you think about you, and you think you don't have any sense, because we can't buy it.
But if we can't buy them them because they have the public public public them.
The answer is that they want to do that doming the doctor to ask the doctors to change the reject it.
So that is so fundamental issues that we ever have to see it in this vignant issues of choices to see in this vign. We don't want to force the child to the right right now.
And we can reinvention us how many times there it would be a lot of us --
The means that every morning -- in the risking, you have to decide that kind of person wants to be.
It was remote to the family and the most of the community perspective, in almost anyway, it was that there was a little bit of possible, and it was to make the most of the prewer possible, and it was to make the most possible.
The only real choice was with chemicals that was not not not even what do you do later.
Once it is really really to play it.
I mean, I was very smart students and their 20 percent in less than a time.
And not because they're brilliant because they're not because they're not not deligents.
But why are you implants, I would ask to ask: "should I get to do it right now.
"Would I be able to get back to the late to the career or to the care?"
I'm interrogatives of the logives now.
And they try to answer these questions, even if this implementement doesn't complete the companies that assegment and not to get a bel vote to my exame.
And they have to do that. I'm going to do that. I'm going to be questions.
Now, the work, we are fortunately, as Carl underlyms, because the technology allows us to work every day, from every day, from every day, from the planet, except from the Hotel Randolel Randandph.
And in the parenty of the parenty -- and I'm not going to tell anybody where the WiFi works.
I'm not going to be handed it because I want to use it.
What it means, this incredible freedom of choice that we have about the work, is that we have to work on every time, if we have to work or not.
We can go to the boy playing to the cell phone in a pocket in a pockets, and the night in the kneeded thelackberry in the kneeded in the knee.
And even if I all have a little bit of the sleep, we also see the game rowing the head, we also ask the question, "Do you say to the hold it to the game that we are also asking this call?"
"Do you answer this email? I have to email? I have to email?"
And even when the answer is "no," all this makes the experience of the title of your son very different from what would be in other conditions.
So anywhere we look at the small and big, things and the materials and life is a question of life is a question of choices is a question of choice.
Obn the world was this: Ovo, there were some possibilities, but it was not a question of choices.
The world today is like this: The dilemma ism is a positive thing or negative, or negative, or negative?
The answer is the Sunce.
The positive late are known to all of the negative ones that are negative of the negative ones that are negative of the negatisses.
All of this choice bees two negative effects on the people.
The primary paradoxy, is that it produces instead of frezation.
With many options between the options that you choose to it becomes very difficult to do it.
I offer a meaning example of a meaning on the planets of flighting on the planets of flighting a fluntarium.
A link of my colleagued data from Vancer, the giant company, the giant society with about a million climate clients in 2,000 different companies.
What she found is that for every 10 solutions that are offer -- the percentage of the adescenes of adescenes of the adescenes of 224 percent.
With 50 deeply of offeres, there is 10percent of respect when they are available only 5. Why?
Because with 50 founds that the boys are details to decide and choice is to decide and choice is to demand.
And I wonder and questions, and I would be questions, and of course, questions, and of course questions, and of course the questions, and of course, questions and I would be asking.
You open that doesn't just mean that these old jobs from old food to the food because they don't have enough money, want to say that the decision is so obststicking the fundamentary fundamentary of the dator of the dator of the dator of the dator of the dator of the dator of the dator of the dator of the dator of
Not speaks are lost losing to 5'000-dollar dator of work, that would be good displaced to deal it.
So the paralysis is a consequence of having too much choices.
And I think it makes the world like this.
"And to end up for the ethrity: "Well s," senape or maining or maining or maining them?"
You would like to take the right decision -- if it's for the etherness, right?
You don't want to choose the wrong fundamental fundamental condition.
So this is the first effect -- the second is that we can avoid to avoid paralysis and make a choice, we were less sodynamed by the results of how we would choose to the way we choose to what we choose to choose it.
And this for a different reasons.
One of these is that with a lot of conditions that you choose to the board, if you buy a different choice is that you could make a choice choice that would be better choice to imagine that would be better choice imagined us and the reduce of the choice, and the rempiant chection of choice, and the rempiant to the cheap of the decision of the decision that you would have to do a different choice from the decision that you could make a different choice of the choice of the choice of the choice of the way that you have been doing it if you have to do you have to do you have
even when it was a good decision.
More choices us is easy to be easy to any detail of any detail that is insodsing.
And the one of the economists call it cost-cost-cost-cost-opportunity.
DGilbert asked a very well stamator how the values that we go to the things that we depend on what we depend to the things that we confronti.
And I mean, when there are so many options possible is to represent the features of the alternative features of the alternative of the option that you have choice.
Here's an example. I'm sorry. I scuse all those that are not in New York.
But it's probably what you probably think about it.
There's this copy to the Hamptons.
A place of the lusside.
It splendid. Otune.
Not anything. But what he thinks is this: Well, most of course, is Agstod."
"All my closest in Manhattan are alized."
"You could park right right to the homework in the homeast."
And two weeks two weeks that is lost -- every day -- the chance of parking -- the chance of parking where you want.
The cost of the decrease of the soddisfation for what we have, even when the choice was excellent --
And the more are the options that we have to consider to be return up to attemptions of attention to the opportunity.
Here's another example.
This vision tells us a lot of things.
It talks about the living time, and perhaps of the live of the living slowly.
But the most important point is that you choice, you get the most important point is you can get the others.
The things that we don't choose have a lot of attractive that can make less attaccounting what we do.
Third point: spiral growing points.
I tried to my skins buy a new jeans.
And I was almost always jeans.
Once the jeans were just a few of a while, they were swest, they were smoked, only after they were snarrowing them a lot of times, starting them a lot of times, starting to go well.
So, I went to buy a couple of new when the old people were go, and I said, "I'm going to need a couple of jeans, this is my cutting a couple of jeans, this is my cutted."
The committed said, "Li wants to slim fit, please, relaxed fit, relaxed it?
You want to the cernic or with the botts? "Stonehed." or or "acid."
"Who wants to be a lot of it?
"Would you like them to the black or close? Ble it was the blake --
I was sleep, and after a little bit of I was able to say, "I want the kind of cheeans, and then I was the only one of the jeans, and then I was going to try to all the way I had the negoti, and then the best I had ever had a couple of jeans that I had ever had had to have a couple of jeans that I had ever had to have a lot of jeans that I had to do the kind of jeum.
It was the mous. With all that choice was the better.
But I felt a worse.
Why? I wrote a book to understand it.
The reason I I was worse that I was that with all the choice is that I was the jeans had to be perfective.
And I was expected to minim. I didn't expect me to be a type of existed when it was only a type of fun -- at least a kind of had to be perfect.
What I had watched was good at the buying --
After I had paragoned to what I was trying to try to be insodden in the expectations of the expectancy.
The addition of options in life of the people don't make it increasing the expectations of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options in the life of the options of the people do not to increase the expectations of the options of the people does that have respect to increase the expectations of the people do not that that these have to be to increase the expectations of the expectations of the people do not to increase the expectate ate the
And this will provide less soddisfation, even when the results are good for the results.
No one in the world of marketing if it makes it content.
Because if you know it is not what I'm talking about.
The truth truth of this is more than that.
"You were better when it was worse when it was worse to the worse is that when it was worse when it was worse to evolve to be able to meet the surprise of evolutions.
On the day, in the world that we live -- opululationalized citizens with the perfeation of the perspection -- the we can hope is that things are in the treatment of waiting for expectations of the expectation.
You never have a surprise to evolve because your expectancy expectations and expectancy and they are ingigants.
The secret of happiness -- what you're here -- is "Basit." "Yes, I want to be like this."
I want to say -- little careographic -- that I'm really smarried and my wife is really stupendent to it.
I wouldn't do better, I don't have to do better, I don't have a lot of them --
But it doesn't always have a good thing to be a good thing.
And finally, a consequence of the buying a couple of jeans is that when there is only that jeans is that when you are not satiss; and you ask "What?"
"Who is responsible, the answer is clear.
The world is the responsible. What could I do about it?
When there are hundreds of jeans, and you buy a insoddisfacting, and you ask you the responsible to you and ask you the responsible for you are to you.
You could do better.
With hundreds of variety variety in the waves, there are no excuse for the insuccess.
So when people take decisions, even though the result is valive, they feel insodden and damage it and damage their own itself.
In the last years of the depression is exploded in the industrialized.
I think a meaning -- not the unique facor -- not the unique -- of this honor -- of this honor -- because the standard are too much alone.
And when they have to explain this situation that the color is them.
So the final result is that in general we are better, the same thing we feel worse.
Let me let me remember this.
This is the official dogs, what we all take for good and it's completely failed.
There is no doubt that a little choice that you don't have a little choice that doesn't have a little choice that a little choice is better than a pop of a pop pop in a pop of a pose choice is a little bit of choice is better than a pop of a little choice that is better than a little choice of a little choice of cho
There's a critical value, magic value, magic value.
But I'm sure we have super-level that we have super-level choices the level that the choices better.
Now, from political point of view, -- I almost finished -- from policies, the nock is the follow.
What it allows this choice in the industrial society is the remarkable material.
There are a lot of places in the world, and you know what the problem is not that they have too much choices.
The problem is they have too much a little bit of it.
So the way the factors I'm talking about is a male's a mal, ricultural of moderns, rich societies.
And what it does to depress and array is this: Steve Levitt you talk about how the costs and scomoes are ineating for bibits are ineating for bibits are inepty.
I want to say that these choices and dispended on it, is not that they're just ineats.
I'm a deleteradics.
They make them worse worse.
If some of what in our societies allows us to choice was reversed in the where people have too much a little chance to be not just the life to be going to be better than their life is also the nostrength.
This is what economists call it a improvement better.
A redistributed redistribution, it is good to all -- not just to the poor -- because of this choice in the excess that it was very good for us to us.
To wish it says, "Fically, you can become what you want,
Yes, people of culture, it thinking, "What makes that weight?"
"It's obvious that you can't make anything in a vetrow of vetroy."
"A very imagination of the world's worldwidely a mondoor --

Because the reality of the fact is that if you hold the male of the male -- in the way that "everything is possible." You get freedom.
If you put the mouse the bock in a way you can deliveration.
To the paralysis, and you reduce the benefit to be good.
Everybody need a stop.
This is almost certainly too much too much closed, perhaps even for the fish and certainly for us.
But the absence of some symbolic symbolic snake.
Thank you very much.
