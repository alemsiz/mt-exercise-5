And I showed these slide this slide to show that the calculation glacial calculation of 40 million years had the size of 48 million years of years of 40 million years of the United States of 40 percent.
And I had this under under the gravity of the problem because it doesn't show the same.
The calculate glacial calculation is, in a sense, the heart heart of the global climate system.
You expands of inversus and winner and wind the wind of the wind and winner and winner and wind of the winds.
The next slide will be a rapid rapid of the last 25 years.
The gains are lots of drawed in the red one.
As you can see it out to the blue screen.
That's the ice in wall, which is the glacira that is returns out of the summer.
You can see that the task of the glacium five years or more, is like the blood -- like the blood -- which is the blood from the body.
In 25 years of this is spent like this.
This is a problem because the interested climate the Earths the landscape of the art where there are huge amount of carbon congelate that microbes that we want to put it in meters from microbes.
Ript to the totality of the atmosphere, the amount of global warming, that quantity might be double, it would be able to be returned to the point of not return.
In some of laghi deeps in Alaska reboundinging the water.
The professored professor. Katey Walter of Alaska has recated with a team in the wall.
Video: Wow! Al Gore: He's the question is if we are the question.
A reason is that this exchange is that this line surrise of the Greenland from the north.
This is a figure in the glacial regim.
The taken had never reached levels like this.
This is the Kangerlussuaq, in the so-egger Greenland of the Greenland
If you want to know how the level of the gain the gain the gather, here is where the sea sken the sea of the gathere, and that's where the sea skin the skin the wall.
These are increasing rapidly increasing.
All the other part of the planet: Antarctic, the largest block of the planet.
The last month last month last month of the glacium is in the ballock of the ice is in negative and that Antarcticularcticularce, which is particularly rapid in the short of the suncharge.
Equid is six feet of water in the water in Groenland in Groenland in Groenland in the Groenland in the Groenland in the Groenland six meters of the water in the Groenland in the Groenland in the Groenland six meters of water in the six of the water in the Groenland six meters of the
Himalaya, the third of ice block of ice block of ice block in the laghi, who were glacium -- a few years ago were glacium --
40 percent of the world's population was going to put the point of the population of the population of the population of the population of the world
On the Ande: this glacier of the water of this city.
The taken is increased.
But when you diminutes the same across the same across the same across the same across the same time.
In California is about 40 percent.
The rips are in crisis.
The predictions, as you get away -- are graving.
The growing growing world in the door a remarkable increasings in the world of incended.
The environmental disaster is increasing a retless and without precedented by the normal and no precedent.
Four times more number of the last 30 years of the last 30 years of the previous 75.
This is a sustainable of insustainable.
If you look at the context of the historical context of the consequence.
In the last five years we added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the oceans every day.
Look at the Earth, in the Exithal of the East of America, and the west, and on the bottom parts of the subcontinent of the continent of the oxygen in the ocean.
The most of the global warming of global warming, and the deforestation, which is the 20, is the use of the basible us.
The oil is a problem, and the carbon is even worse is even worse for the floor.
The United States are one of the two countries, together with the Cina.
And it proposed to build many other central central carbon of the carbon of the carbon and and the rest of the carbon of the carbon of the carbon of the carbon of the carbon of the charge of the carbon of the frame of the carbon of the carb.
But we're assisting a change.
These are the annulled projects in the last years and some of the versus of the last years of green alternative alternative project.
At every way, there's a political lotate in our country.
The carbon industries and the oil of the oil are 250 million dollars in the last year to promote the carbon in the last year, which is a oxymore.
And I remind me remind me something,
And Natmal in Natmal Tennessee, where I live to 3.8 billion gap billion gap of carbon of carbon of car.
Maybe you saw it on the news of the news.
This is the second largest flows in America.
It's successful around Natmal --
The natalizes of one of the carbon industry was this:
Video: One of the carbon is a type of a type and happy.
It's abundant here in America, and it makes our economy.
Frosty the carbon is more and more and more clean.
It's in the price, loved and workers are making the stink stery.
Al Gore: Do here is the carbon of the West Virginia.
The largest societies on the world's Massey Coal. This is Massey Coal. This is his friend.
Video: Don Blank: I'm clear, I'm going to clear, Nancy Peloas, Harry Reid Reid -- they don't know what they're talking about.
Al Gore: So the Alleance for the Protein the Clima has launched two nails.
This is a one of it.
Video: All right, in COALery see the climate changes like a minatical climate to our business.
And in our prioritizes is invest a great amount of money in a public effort to make the public and confuses the real truth on the carbon the carbon.
In fact, the carbon is not sport.
We think it's clean -- it has a good profum.
So not precupatements of climate change.
Let me do to us.
Video: All right, Carbons you know, I heard about a lot of the
So let's take a game of the framework in a structure of the carbon the clean the carbon the clean it.
Straordinary machines are a little romorose, but this is the sound of the charge of the technology.
The consumer of carbon is between the main the main the global rescaling of global charbon and the technology of the carbon that you see change.
Do you look at a charge of the carbon of charge of charge --
Al Gore: Infinally, the positive alternative positive is connecting the national security.
Video: H: The America, is in the national security security of national security climate climate climate climate climate climate climate climate climate climate climate --
The filter that the college is our dependence from the combinable combinable and the oil is and the important.
Now, there's a new audience for usual solution to us.
Repower America: 100-year-old-house energy in decade --
They plan to put the America, to work, to make us sure and helps us to stop the global warming.
Finally, a solution that you have to solve our problems.
Repower America. Scoprint.
Al Gore: This is the ultimate one.
Video: H: It's about the America.
One of the fastest ways to bring the dependence from the combinable dependence from the combins that are our planet.
All the future is here. Ventue, one new energy network.
He talks about 2: Nuoves for the instead, well, the indegree of well.
M: Reption: Reption.
Al Gore: On you have a proverbio African says, "If you want to go to the sun.
If you want to go away, go away, you go away."
We have to go away, fast.
Thank you very much.
The year last last TED fect in the TED fect in the LHC.
And I promise to return to go to how the machine.
So here I got the other one that the other time you don't have the other time -- the LHC is the largest scientific experiment -- 27 kilometers of circumstoms of circumstomer surround.
His compit is to return the conditions that were less than a billion second from the beginning of the universe -- until 600 million times a second.
And all of this is just environment.
This is the machine.
We photographs these mini-Big Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Big Bang Big Bang Big Bang Big Bang Bang Big Bang Big Bang Big Big Big Bang Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Bang Bang Bang Big Bang Bang Big Bang Big Big Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Big Bang Big B:
This is what I work. It's called ATLAS -- is largely 444 feet and has a 22 meters and has a 22 meters and has a 22 meters and has a 12 feet of meters and it has a 12 feet of meters and has a 12 feet of meters and has a diameter of 22 meters and has a 12 meters and it has a diameter of 22 meters and has a diameter of 22 meters and it has a diameter of 22 meters and has a 12 meters and a 12 meters and a four meters and a 12 meters and has a 12 meters and has a 11112 meters and a meters and a hourmeters of meters of meters and a 12 feet of the four meters.
This is a picture of the ATLAS image in ATLAS in building so you can see the proportions.
The 10 sets of the last year, we got the machine.
And this picture was taken by ATLAS.
It was because of immenses fest, in the heavy room in the heavy room of the control.
It's a picture of the first phascise of particles that had all the around the LHC, and he was in the LHC, and a part of the LHC, and spread particles inside the LHC, and spread particles inside the relevator.
In other words, when we see that the 10 set, we understand that the machine, we understand that is a great life.
I don't know if it was to do you can exactly the one of Google and saw that the pay beginning was this --
That means that we had a cultural impact of the cultural impact on the scientific impact.
About a week later, there was a problem with the machine, had to be in these films here -- these films -- these films -- these films -- these films -- these films -- these films -- these films -- these films -- these films -- this films -- these films -- these films -- these films -- these films -- these films -- these films -- these films --
These films are 13,000 prints when the machines works at the massive of the power.
Now, technical technical of you look at files and say, "It's not true. They're filter."
And they can do it because when they're very quickly cosid-called the surface of the superconvicts.
So, at less 271 degrees, in a inferior at the stairs in the space between the stars, these files can bring that corrup.
In one of the most of the most of the magnets in the LHC, there was a fabrication.
So the files are surrises to read themselves read and 13,000 printings suddenly meeting a electric.
This was the result of it.
Now, this is even more impression, if you think that these magnets are about 20 tons than 20 tons are about 30 centimeters.
They are damaged about 50 magnets.
We had to take it to the day, what we did we did.
We have repristinated and add the right and add of it.
They're now returning all of their below underground.
Entrum the end of the LHC will be new integrate integrat.
We accenate it, and we expect to get data or him, and keep it or he keep it so our wind and continue so our wind to find out what the universe.
Now, of course, in a certain four-four -- these accidents return the debate on the value of science and engineering. It's eera. It's easy to confuture about.
I think that the fact that it is so difficult to go beyond the limits, I think this is the value of the LHC.
I would like to conclude with the words of a Ingless, Humphrey Davy, Humphrey Davy, image, in defense his inuses his pupill, his pupill, his clean was Michael Faray, said, "No is so dangerous for the progress of human mind as the human mind that are define ideas that are not in nature of the world as the conversation that we are not in nature, which is completely dramat, and the neighborhood
Thank you.
I want to start asking you to rethink about here, from the children, by the children, play copined the morning.
While you understand how to reach them and reach them and resolve them and moves, learned and we learned to think and resolve it and solve problems and resolve problems and handipulating relationships and relationship.
The space reason is properly connected to the way we understand the way we understand part of the world around us.
So, from informforming information by using our interaction with physics, with the physics, and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanima, I started asking myself -- I started asking myself to ask mouse as a computer, instead of the mouse as the policy that moves on a desktop, we could deal with a fyoung information with both and a fysick of the hands of the hands of the hands --
and we put it on our please?
The question was so interesting that we decided we decided we decided we decided to explore the answer --
In the words, a Siftable computer is a big interactive as a big discover.
In the words, a Siftable computer is a big interactive as a big discover.
You can move with hand, they can see it in the hand, they can see the right now, and they have a wireless.
But most of the physics, as physics, as the Chinese are physics, you can move just to realize it.
The Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem of instruments for information.
And as they get more physics, and I know about the right of the right and as the others, and the others, and as they get more physics, and the other hand, of how we can drive them and we can explore the new and the fun and fun and fun and fun and the different stili stiles of interaction.
I'm going to start with some simple example.
This is configurated to show the video sam: if you including it in a direction, if you including it in the other part of the other part of the other part of the other part of the other side back.
These interactive ritritritrities are consciouss.
If they are the business, you interested in what they are around it.
If they are surrounded and they can agre it and they can agre a little bit of a little bit of it.
If they are surrounded and they can agre it and they can agre a little bit of a little bit of it.
They also have their movement, and inclination.
We realized that one of the interesting of the interaction was the power to use gestures on the data, "See example of the instance, "She's a couple as if it was a liquid.
In this case, we have three Siftable configurated as secks of green and I can use it to the color, where they mix in the centry, where they mix are mix.
and I can use it to the color, where they mix in the central central central of the central centry.
If we true too much -- we can reput a little bit of a little bit of it.
They're also beautiful chance of learning, as language, mathematics and games of logical logical and games of logical results.
Now I'm --
This is a Fibonact that I do with a program of equations.
We have a game game of words that is in the Scarabeum and Boggle.
From every turns out to every turn in the house of every Siftable, Pratically, in every turns to every turn on every Siftable, and while you try to get words on a house of a dition.
Then, after about 30 seconds remissing and a new set of lectures and new chance of lecture.
Thank you.
Here's the kids came to the Middle Lab, I did it in the Middle Lab, I did a video.
They are pleased mold.
And one of the interesting things of this kind of application is that you don't have to give people a lot of education.
You just say, "Well the paints of the words, and they know what to do.
Here's the other people who try it.
This is our most young beta test extremely young bete.
He really wanted to implants.
They just were driving him.
Now, this is a kind of a interactive cartoon.
We wanted to build a tool for the language of the Lui is Felix.
It can inserve new characters in the scene, soil, solled their associats.
It can inserve new characters in the scene, soil, solled their associats.
So, it's doing using the sun.
Video: The sune is surging.
David Merrill: Ho's taken a treat the scen.
Video: The treator --
Bel work!
So I took the Siftable and put it up close the people can interact the characters --
Video: Ba!
-- inventing the story.
Video: Can on!
DM: It's a story with the open, and it can decide how you get the way to the slide as you would.
DM: It's a story with the open, and it can decide how you get the way to the slide as you would.
Video: Vole,
DM: The last example I have time to show you is a tool, realized recently, to execk and execk and execk and execk and execk music.
is a instrument, realized recently, to field and execk and execk music.
The Siftable here is from sound like the basic and the bacteria.
Each of these has four different variations, and you can choose what you can use it.
You can get these sound of these sound in a sequence from comport or the floor of the food.
And to modify it just doing a sound of a sound and a "sequence."
These are effects that you can control the reverse and the filter.
And you attack to a particular and then including it to add it to add it.
And then there are the general effects as time and volumes that are apply in the entire sequence.
We look like it works.
Video: DM: We start put a base in two Sift," "sequencak "sequencak in a series, we get the other basic thing, we add the other basic basic --
Now I put a bunch line.
Video: DM: Or on the top of the person --
Video: DM: And I'm going to put the filtery of the bacteria, so I can control the effect from the face.
Video: I know how to fast the whole sequence, including the whole sequence, and the other hand the other side of the other.
Video: DM: And now I'm going to add the filter, to give more expression.
Video: DM: I can can recombining the sequence.
So I don't have to planning the first one, but I can sudden, to make it more or more than the cortas.
And now, finally, I can get the whole sequence in the whole sequence, including the Siftable "volume."
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is build new interfaces of the machine, as the machine, as our brain and the body.
And today, I had time to show you one of the results of this percords, and also some possible possible that we try to bring out of the laboratory.
The concept I want to transmit you to transmit you to the new generation of objects for digital objects with digital media in our world in our world that we want.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the now of the now to talk to everybody with you.
They're a write writing.
And I reveveal books is my profession, but it's more than that, of course of course.
It's also love and the fashs of my life.
And I don't expect that it can change it.
But then, you know, something particular is successful recently in my career, and my career and my career, who brought me to realibrate the whole reported with this work.
The particular thing I recently recently this book, this biographer called "Mangia, Ama" -- Ama" -- Ama" -- Ama" -- for some reason -- for some reason -- and he became a big sense of interactional recent interactional sensational.
And the result is that everywhere you go to now, people are treating me like if I were convicted to me.
For -- convicted, convict!
They are now all worried and saying, "You don't know anybody fear more to do it?
You don't have fear to continue to continue to write all life without power to create a book that can be able to make somebody book that can be able to somebody els?"
that can be important to somebody els?
It's rashed rashes, you know.
But it might go worse in the worse that I remember 20 years ago, when I started to say people -- I was a adolescent -- I wanted to be a write writing.
I meet it meeting the same basic react from the country.
And people said, "Don't you know what I can't do you have success?
You don't fear that the humiliation of the reflows you have killed you know?
You don't have to do this mester for all the whole life without any swimming and die on a heart of the horse of the shop of the shock of the caves of the cample?"
So you know.
The answer -- the short answer to all of these questions is, "S."
I think I can fear of all of those things.
I had the paper.
And I also have fear of many other things that people might not have to ine.
As the algain and other spects.
But, as I writing the thing I thought and I thought and I asked myself is why is?
Is it ration?
It's logic, who anybody who needs to be expect to be speaking to do.
But what is so particular in the impresection to make us to make it about the mind of the mental health in a way that other carrier doesn't make it make not fanno?
And I mean, for example, he was a chemical engineer and I don't remember one time in his 40 years of the activity where he was asked if he had to be able if he had to be able to be engineer if he had to be able to be engineer if he had to be able to be able if he was a little bit of a money to be able to be clear chemical engineer if he was asked to be going to be able to be
There was never -- that we never -- that block of John, how do you wouldn't it?
It didn't work, so that it would be work?
Onestly, the engineers as group as group don't have certainly in the century, the reputation of being alcohype to be alcohype of depressure.
We writttors, we have enough this reputation, and not just writers but creative of all generates of all generates that are huge instables mentally instables mentally instables mine.
And it doesn't rest that look at the triste of the deaths of the magnific deaths that are are the charge of the century, they die and often to them.
And the ones that are not suicidata seems to be really disagreed by their women
Norman Mailer, before I did, in the last last last last few of my book said, "Ogny book me a little bit more than it was a little bit more about the work of the works.
But we don't have the better when we heard about why we heard these talks about the very long way we have been interior somehow we were completely interior and accepted the notion that the creativity and the suffering that the art and the end, finally, it will always drop.
And the question I want to ask all the today is, are you agree with this ide?
It goes es this -- because it looks like a centimeter of a distance centimeter of myself --
I think it's hodiose.
And I think it's dangerous and I don't want to see the perpetuate in the next century.
I think it's better to encourage our great minds creative to the creative creative to the live.
And I know that, in my case -- in my case -- in my case -- would be very dangerous to that I would have to feel that I would have to be a lot of the circumstances where I in my career.
Of course -- involved here, I'm pretty young for 40 years.
I have about four decade of work in me.
And it's very likely to be likely write anything that is going to be right now in the world as that used to be used by the world as it was going to be able to my last book.
I'm going to be slavery, because we are all more or friends here -- is likely my greatest success is to my greatest success is to my should.
Oh, Gesus, that you think of cours!
You know this is the gender of thinking that it brings a person to begin to the nine of the morning and I don't want to do this.
I would continue to do this work that we love to do this work that we do.
So, the question becomes do?
And so I seed it after a lot of reflections, that the way to do it to continue to do a psychological costruck struck struck psychological cool, OK?
I got to find a distance of security between me, which I'm writing to me, and my natural natural reation that reaction is going to get out of the reaction of the year to the next year, as I was trying to find out of the time to look through the time, trying to find out of the other societies to see if they could have the better ideas, and seeing other societies and healthy and healthcare and more healthcrows and more and
about creativity people to do the inerent inerents of creativity.
And that research took me to the ancient and the ancient Roma.
And I would be in certain and then it comes back and then back.
In the ancient Grecia and the ancient Rome -- people don't seem to believe that the creativity came from men men, OK?
And it thought the creativity was this spirit about and that he came to the men from a few surface and unknown and unknown to the die and unknown to the distant and unknown to the driver.
They called the Greem called the "demons."
Socry, wonderful, he thought it was that I had a demit that elargive scape from the long.
Romans were the same idea, but they called the kind of spirit without the body a genius.
And that's the big because the Romans were not thinking that a genius was somebody particularly smart that a smart of smart.
They believed that a genius was this kind of divince that he had live in the walls of the study of a care of a cut, like Dobby, and that was out of the Gobby, and the working of the result of the works.
Exectional -- etic, that's the distance of which is the distance of psychological construction that price you protect you from your work.
And everybody knew that was so that it worked, right?
So the antic artists were protages of things, like for example too narcissm, no?
If your work was exceptional -- you couldn't get and all the market, everybody knew that were helped by this genius.
If your work is not a little bit of your job, it wasn't all of your just?
They knew that was your genius that it was your genius to be a inabilities.
And so people have conceived the creativity in Occident for a very long time.
And then the Rinascise came and all changed it, and all of this big idea; we put the human being; we put the human beings and the misteries and no longer and no longer and no longer to creatures that write from the divinity.
This was the principle of the rock of the raational extra and people start thinking that creativity came completely from the ishing.
And for the first time in history, you get to this or that artist as a rather of the argu's like a rather than a person with the genius.
And I have to tell you, I think it was a big error so.
I think that allowed to someone, a simple person to believe that it is like a recipiring and the source, and the surprising all of the mysteries and inthern in the misteries and etherns is a responsibility to the human fragile to the human fragile to the human fragile fts in the human flogible to be like a recipsible or too big and the ef,
It's like to ask somebody to engine,
Deform and the history and creates all these extremely expectations on the performance.
And I think it was this pressure to have the artists in the pass 500 years.
And if this is true, and I think it is the question, and now, and now?
We can do it different?
Maybe you can go back to a more ancient understanding of the relationship.
Or maybe no.
Maybe we can't cancer 500 years of raational thinking about 18 minutes.
And there are probably people in the audience that would be reading suspects of scientific notion of scientific notion that they follow people are going to be able to the next projects.
And I will probably convinced you all about this thing.
But the question I would like to bring is -- why is that?
Why don't you think about it in this way?
Because it has more sense than any other thing that has ever heard to explain the exasperant exasperant impredicbility.
A process that as anybody who ever ever taken to do something -- so so much of it, everybody is -- -- it doesn't get combination.
And, in fact, it can be a little bit of paranormal paranormal looks.
I did this meeting recently with the extraordinary poeter Ruth Stone, who has now 90 years, but it was a poet, and he said that it was a poet, and he said it in the Virginia, working out in the wall, and he was working out in the wall, and I would be the wind from the countrackage.
He said that it was like a fragorous tren.
And that was rotoling to the landscape.
He heard it came to the land because he had to be able to get the land under his feet.
He knew to have a only thing to do to that point and he was talking about it, "He's going to run as a morn."
And so it was going to be so towards and it was following from this poety poety and it would have to make a card piece of paper and a fasty in the freezed fast, while the page and it it would be the pay on the page.
Other volved to be enough fast, so the recorded and the record and the record and the poetry and the poetry the rock and the roployed through and she would have been going to keep it on the landscape and would have been going to keep it on the landscape and it would have to do it and the "other poet."
Then there were the volved -- this piece is not forget -- there were no time in the moments that was almost losing it almost los?
So, he was running at home and was trying to card and the poetry was going through and the poetry was in the rockets and then he was going to go through and him, and then he was like it was like if you get away with the other hand and the off.
He was the poety of the poety and the reputting in his body and the repacked on the pay and the pay on the pay and the pay of the rock and the repacks.
And in these cases, the poetry would be presented on the perfect and intact on the last word to the first one of the last word to the first one.
So when I feel the pensays -- it's a crazy exactly the process of my creative process.
I don't all my creative process -- I'm not a convict!
I'm a mule, and my way to work is to work is to see me at the same hours every day and to work and go to and go to and go to and go to the up.
But even even in my head, I spoke, I spoke that thing, sometimes against that thing, sometime.
And I imagine that many of you have a lot of you do it.
You know, if the work and ideas and ideas and ideas and ideas they could not know I could not know that.
And what is this thing?
And how can we relate to us to do us to lose the head, but rather like that, rather you know, that we do to remain?
And I really, the best example of the example of the example I have the Musist Tom Waits, which I interview in a day.
We were talking about this, and you know, Tom, and you know, Tom, the major the major the artist of the artist of the artist of the clean to control, to seeing these species of the creative species of creative cutterized.
But then he was going to be hot and a day, and a day day he was driving on the cartoons Angeles, he changed it all for him.
He was going to go fast and all of a little bit of a ballodia, which is that it comes in his head as it does the inspiration, elusive and the wind, you know, and the want, you know, it's wonderful, and the desig, but not know how to take it.
It has no piece of paper, it doesn't have a matheme of a matheme is not a recorator.
So it starts to feel this kind of old old old old old it in the type, "I'm going to lose and I can lose it to lose this song as this song as this song as a lost of this song as you lose as it was lost of this song as you can get this song in the type, and I can be lose to lose this song of the old kind of the old kind of old old old --
I'm not enough and I can't do it with this."
And instead of go to the panic stoppanic stoppanic --
And I will have the whole process and made something completely new process.
He looked like the sky and said, "Scusa, I can't see that I'm done I just done do?"
"To you seems that can write a song what?
If you really want to exist, it comes to a more opportunity when I can take care of you.
One of triment, you get to the other today.
You can disturbing Leonard Cohen."
And his process working changed after this.
Not work, the work was still dark as you get dark in the work,
But the process, and the fishing of the anthornia was released when the genius, the genius, the genius, which he was going to be a realizing it from the other than the realization where it was happening to that had no thing to be one interiorzed and reward it --
but well-culied, wonderful bizarre collaboration a conversation between Tom and this thing that was not Tome and external and that was not Tom.
So I feel that story that is also to change a little bit the way I was working and already saved me a face of it.
This idea, he saved me when I writing "Mangia, Ama," and he was going to be in one of those class of the disperation where we are working on something and we couldn't have to think that it will be a disaster that that the worst is going to be the worst books.
Not just bad the worst book written in the written of writing.
And I started thinking about this project.
But then I remember Tom who talked to the air and sudden.
So I went to my face on the written and I would say, "I realized my comments to a stance.
And I said, "Yeah, well, what we are both about that, if this book is not going to be brilliant not be brilliant not be brilliant not be brilliant not going to be brilliant not be bone?
Because as I see I am a little bit of what I haven't more about this.
So if you want to press you to press you to press you and do your party.
Okay. But if you don't do it, I don't know anything.
I'm going to write the same because I am my work.
And I would like to favor that I today is that I today today, I realized to my own own own parent," because of the North -- secools in the deserts of Africa in the deserts of the dances and the sacred to the key and the sacred and the hours and the walking to the hours and the albasic and the albasic huntil and the allower and the hours and the hours and the hours and the allower to the hours to the walk
And they were always magnific because the balls were professional and were fantastic and they were fantastic.
But every tap, of course, something happen, and one of these artists became to reality in fact,
And I know what you know about what I know is because I know that the view everybody, a lose of the performance of it.
It was like the time you stopped and the walking walk through a kind of landscape and it was not doing anything from the solit, as the 1,000 night -- but all of the sun, but all of it all happens.
And suddenly I don't appears just like a human one.
But you get out of the deline and under the drivered in the divinity.
And when this happen, the time, the people who knew what was, they knew what he called her name.
They had the hands and began to sant, "Ah, Do God, God, God."
That's God, you know.
And they were reached in the history -- when the Morors the Spapain the Spapain and the rest of the crowing the century of "All Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Ah," which you can feel in the history.
In Spay -- when a artist has made something impossible and the magic -- "Ah, magn, oh, magnic, bad," incomprehensible, a foot of God.
And it's great because we need to be --
But, the problem comes the day down, when you can see the ball, when you can see and discovers that are the 111 of the Martedday and the fall of the God is not long.
It's just a death, with the knels to the knes and maybe never be more to the tree of that although it will never be more to high.
And maybe no one will chanters the name of God while and what is it must do with the rest of his life?
It's difficult.
This is one of the most dolorous re-cilies to make a creative life.
But maybe it doesn't have to be so angood, if you can not believe that, in the most extraordinary expects of your extraordinary expects of your being from you to you,
But I believe it just that you data in prested by a inimaginable imaginable of this squisite part of your life that you have to go to somebody else when you find.
And, you know, if we think in this whole whole whole change.
And so I started thinking about it, and it's surely as I thought about the different months during the book of the book that I'm going to be a book that I'm going to be dangerous exactly dangerous about my big deal.
And what I have to keep on the electric when I feel electrue, not fear that I don't have fear that I don't have fear that I don't have fear that I don't have fear that I have to keep on the electric and I just just going to keep the electric and I just just kept to tell me about this is, I don't fear to be fear from this is, I don't fear that you have
I don't get to the ar. From just your work.
He represented you to press you to your party, any of the party, any of the party, any of the way.
If your work is ball, ball, ball, ball.
If the divine, I assumption, you know, I would measure some kind of wonder, for a moment just a moment in your effors, then "Ole!"
One of these, you know, you do the same dance.
And "Ole!" to you, you know.
I think I have to be teaching it.
"Ole!" to you, even for you, just for the human love and head to the human talks to the continue talks to you to get continuously.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
And I talked about some of these projects on the human genome genome on the human genome of the new set of genes.
Now we're starting a new lost of the biology and we started to digitalized biology and now to the biology and now now now in a new fashion, and by the way, and synthesizing and synthizing and sintetizing and synthizing and sinting a new sintetise and sintetizing and now to the biology and now
We always seeing to bring big.
"What is the lifesty?" is something that many biology I think we have taken to figure out to figure out to the various levels.
We tried different approaches, reduced it to the minimi minimes in the terms
We're digitalized by almost 20 years ago.
When we sequenced the genome of the human genome of the biology of the biology in the digital world.
Now we ask us -- we can regenerate the life, or create new life from this digital?
This is the map of a little organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, which is the most of the smallest genome of those that can authority in the laboratory in the laboratory of those that can authory in the laboratory.
And we tried to reduce the genome the genome to create a little bit more smaller than that.
We are able to eliminate a hundred genes about 500 that are here.
But when we look at his map on his map of metabolic metabolic and respect to the now.
And that's simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can elimine, one to the time, it's very imlikely to a liver cell.
So we decided that the only via to progress to progress this cropm in a way to be able to make some of these fundamental questions.
And so we started the wind of the "We can we synthesizing a cromom of the ma?"
It can the chemistry of producing these big molecule that we never have to create before that?
And in fact, in case case we can make a cromother?
A cromosome, it's just a piece of inert.
The speed with which we are able to digitalized the life is growing up to exponential exponential that we can digitalized exponential that we can digitalized the speed.
Our capacity of write the genetic code of genetic code of rather slowly, but it's better than that.
And our results results the results the result of the exponential curve.
We started more than 15 years ago.
The process has required a lot of past, starting with a biothic review before we started the first experiments.
But we found that synthesize DNA is very difficult.
There are thousands of thousands of cars in the world that are producing little segments of DNA, the longer than 30 to 50 to 50 to the set, the most centerrors is longer than the segment is longer than the center is longer than the center is longer than 30 to the sland.
So we had to develop a new metod to assembling these framments and correct the middle and the middle of the errors.
And this was our first tent, in particular information of the genome of Phi X 174.
It's a little viruses that kills killed batter.
We designed the fragments, effect of the errors and had a molecule of DNA molecule of about 5,000 literally 5,000 literally
The interesting part of the interesting part of this chemical material and we put it in the bacteria, and we started reading this genetic code and produced this genetic code and produce the virtual particles virtual particles virtual particles virtual particles virtual particles and produce the virtual particle of virtual material material and the batteries, the battery of
The virals are then, then you release the cellules, are back back and distroom, and they distrops.
I talked about recently recently recently recently saw that they seem to their own model.
They have more than you.
We believe that this is a situation where software can actually build his own hardware in a biological system.
But we wanted to do the bigger things.
We wanted to build the whole chromosome.
They're more than 580 milecture of genetic code of genetic code.
So we thought of built it in cassets of virus, so we could change the cassets to understand what the cassets are the components of a living.
The projecation is crucial information and if we start with information in a computer, these are must be very accurate to be very accurate it.
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 the first time, in 1995 to the first 10 mibasic accurate for every 10 mibe.
We found it, resequencing it -- 30 mierror. If we had that original sequence.
One part of the process is to design, that you can get the 50 lectures that are slowing up with all the other segments to build under the smaller of the tiny working together.
We do the elements here --
You probably have read to the board that we inserve in the board
Think about this is the cost of the genetic code on four letter: A, C, and T.
Three of those lectures together about 20 friend's lock about 20 loads of lectures for every adminoacid every adminoacid for every adminoacid of the lecture.
So we can use the genetic code for write words, fraint, pensive thinking.
What we did at the beginning is automomomat.
Some are deluses from the fact that it wasn't poet.
We designed these segments for just to unique with the same things.
There are experience that they repaid them and put them and put them together and put them to put them together and put them and put them together and put them out and put them and put them out and put them out and put them out the charge and put them out and put them them and put them to them.
And we started to assembling the particular segments from five to seven my letter, unends to make 24 miles of the 24 miles of the lecture of the lectures to 72 my letter to 72 miles to the literally until the letter to 72 my letter.
We produced these segments in fact, we produced these segments in the dance so we are going to make a remarkable production of that we are tently extremely robbroken -- as you can see in a minute.
We're trying to self-such the process.
So, this looks like the tabellons a basic players of a basic player
When we arrive to these segments very long, more than 100 miles -- more than 100 miles are more directly in the E.
You get to the limits tools of the modern tool.
So we considered other mechanisms.
We knew about another mechanism called recombination called recombination of the biology to repaid the DNA to repeak the DNA to repeak the DNA to the centers.
Here's an example.
This organism, called Deinococs razy drinohing three million radioxide ray of radication.
You can see in the square in the sound as his chromosome.
In 12 -- 24 hours is reassembled exactly as it was before.
They were able thousands of organisms that are able to do this.
These organisms can be totally drops.
They can live under either.
They're absolutely sure life exists in space and you moved to find new environments of water.
And to say the real NASA showed that this aven.
This is a picture of the molecule that we built using these process, just using the boundaries of the design appropriate design.
The lievidence of the car assembly the car asks.
This image was not taken with a microscope with a electronic microscope with a microscope --
It's a molecule that we can see it with a microscope with a law.
These are pictures that they cover a period of about six seconds.
This is the published that we did a little time ago.
They're more than 580,000 letting code of genetic code code.
It's the most great molecule that we have ever created by the man who created by man.
It has a fish, a molecular fish.
If we spend it with a 10 pay of 10 of the top, we would like to have 142 pages to just transcriter this genetic code.
Now, how do we do it work?
Of course, we tracked a virus.
It's a little bit more complicated when they use the bacteria.
It's simpler than the eucariot cells as our eucariot as our eucleum and inser, and it just extract a how, which is basically the process of clon.
In the archaea the archaea is integrated integrated into the cell phone in the cell phone that we are able to do a complete transplants that we are able to do a complete cromosome from a crowing and to the other and active it.
We can do a cromosomes from a microbial species of a microbial species.
The two are different are how the men are fun as men as well.
We added some genes in the way that we could decide what chromother.
And then the one is throwing with the people, so that we killed all the proteins.
And when we put it in the cellular cell -- and you get our graph, and you will appreciate our chromosome, the new cell cell phone is gone in the cell phone is went into the cell phone in the cell phone.
And we started thinking we couldn't go to it, but we tried to be -- but we tried to be going to be there.
This is one of the most exectures of evolution.
We found that many species have added a second or a third or a third of a few hundreds of new thousands of new tracks in a second thousands of new tracks in the species.
So who thinks about evolution as a gene of the gene that is not understood a lot of the biology.
They were in the inner of restrion is that restrion is that addicts of the DNA.
The chromosomes that was in the cell phone doesn't have one.
The cell phone -- the crops that we insert --
And it is expressed and recognized the other chromosome, it has masticked the other crop, and we recognized it with only only the crum.
it became blue blue because of the genes that we insert.
And in a short of time, all the characteristics of a species are lost of the new species of the new species of the new software that we put in the new software that we put in the cellule.
All the protein are changed, members are changed, and when we read the genetic code of equid the genetic code of what we transfer what we transfer it.
Now, this might seem alterial alterial software DNA software DNA we can change the things in enough sustain.
Now, I explayed that here is not about genesis -- but of progress from three million years from three million years and a half of evolution, and I said that maybe we are to create a new version of the Cambrian explosion of this digital process of this digital process of this digital process of the degres-based process of this digital process of the degress in the gymes,
Why do I think about that?
I think it's obvious enough when we think about our necessity.
We're going to spend six billion and a half of people to nine billion in the next 40 years.
And I was to give an example of the 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for each one in 1940 years on the planet, in 40 years, there are are going to be four years,
We're now doing now at now to find food and clean water and clean water and basic and a half of the billion and a half of half billion people.
It will be more harder to do it for us.
We are more than five billion carbon of carbon of 30 billion bars.
That means a hundred million bark at the day.
When we try to find biological processes or any kind of process to replace to replace them, it will be a challenge of the process,
We have to keep the most of all the CO2 emission of these materials that finished in the atmosphere.
At day, thank you very much, thank you in the scientific discoveries in the world, we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I like to think that are the designed for the future.
The electronic industry is only a dozen about components, and think about how many different things are coming out of different things are coming.
Our limits are data principlely by biological reality and our imagination.
We have a lot of techniques, thank you very quickly in synthesization, in grab of creating what we call genomic genomic genomicics --
We can build a big robot that can make a big robot that can produce a million chromosomes at the day.
Think about the 20 million different genes or to try to get the processing process to make the processes to make the processes or drugs, we can change a little bit of a little team, and create biology and make more than in the last 20 years of science.
And it's just a standard section of standard.
We can choose to survive, chemical production or chemical carbon or of the chemical carbons, production of vaccines of vaccines --
This is an instants of some software programmed to be able to set and designing species us to set and designing species on the computer.
Well, we don't know necessarily as they will be not.
We know exactly what their genetic code of genetic code.
Now we're concentrate on the carbon of the rest of the generation.
You see you see that you can extract out of the gran ethanol out of the reality.
We have a floors of second and third generation that will use enough pretty dall, as the higher as the tanol.
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without making a big impact of food and limited the cost of food and the limiting CO2 in the material that we are working on the CO2 in the materials that we are working on the planet that can reach the cells that can reach this discover, and we think that we could have a little bit of the early loud for 18 months.
The solar light by the CO2 is a metodom -- but in our discoveries all the world, we found different metods.
This is a organism that we described in 1996.
It lives in the ocean deep, about 2500 feet of the depth of the water perature of the water of the water.
They put out of CO2 using the hydrogen molecular as the source of energy.
We're trying to understand if we can instead of the CO2, which can be transported by transported by the CO2 in the CO2 in carbon to the CO2 in the process.
So we think that short we might increase what we might increase what the basic question is Not -- we have the real -- we have the real -- we have the dest goal to repirate the whole industry.
Exactly. If you can't do it from TED, where can you do that?
It would become a main of energy.
And yet we're working on the same metods to create vaccines to create vaccines.
You saw this year with the influence, we are always inthrow a year and a dollar, and a dollar, and it is to find out the right vaccine --
I think that that it can change building vaccinable to change in the ant.
That's what the future would start to change it looks like this, now, the tree of evolution, accelerating the evolution, accelerate the evolution, and indefine cells and indefine cells.
We are so so much from the best people.
Our discover is to make enough to try to make it very long enough to make it. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
First of all I will see the most rapidly possible, some fundamental work that we took to Microsoft in the Microsoft in a water in a year fact, almost a year ago in the middle of the new technology that we have to do it. This is Seadragon.
It's a environment where you can interact is in the local level that remote with a huge amount of data from visual data --
We are seeing a lot of gabyte photographs with a kind of digital zoom and continue, for a fast, and continuous fast, to a fast.
And it doesn't matter how big the amount of information that we see how big these data or images.
Most are photographs -- but this for example is a decade of the Bilibrary of the Bilibrary of the Congress, and reents in the gamma of 300 megam.
It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that limits its prestations of a system like this is the number of the number of the screen in any time. It's also a very flexible architecture of the screen of the screen of the screen of the screen of the scue of the screen of the screen of the system as this is the num
This is a book inter, example of data not images.
This is the Dickens. The Dickens. Each the couple represents a capitol.
And to show you that it's just about textbooks and not imagine, we can make a real thing about the general representation of a representation of the head, not a photo.
It could be a little bit of a little bit of a book electronic book a book of electronic book --
You don't consider.
This is a more realistic example of the Guardian example of the Guardian.
Each image is the beginning of a section.
And it will give you a very pleasure and the beautiful experience of a read version of a review or of a quotidy or a quarter, which is a molplices of a half of a half of a half of a half of a half of a half of a very half of a half of a re
We also did something with the angle of this particular number of this particular number of the Guardian --
We created a high-resolution of the high-resolution, much higher than what you used in a normal publish.
If you want to see the characteristics of this self-aware of this authrow here.
Or other models, or even the specific specific specific models,
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on the screen of space on the screen.
We hope that it means to put a little bit of the path and other porcheries like this, not to be necessary.
Of course, the map applications for this kind of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology.
And I don't want to lose time, if not to say that we don't say that we have contributes to give in this field.
These are all the streets in the USA recial image of the NASA.
So we now now now now now we go to something else.
This is effectively from the webs; you can go to the websky's going to see it.
This is a project called Photosynth, which is two different technology.
One is Seadragon and the other is a very interesting research, a very interesting of the University of the University of Washington, with the aid of Steve Seve Seve Seve Sewliski Research. and Research.
And it's from the web, I went from Seadragon.
You can see it when we do this kind of screen where we can spend from a picture of the other and have this kind of experience and have this kind of experience resolution.
But the collocaon the pictures here has actually a meaning.
The algorithms of visualization of the computer have recorded these images together in the way that you can see the real slight-to-crows in the Grassit of the Grasside in Montags -- all of the song -- you know, the chanaish of a slide of a slight-f-stabies of a shoot-show elements of a level of the space or levels of the space
I don't know if I have time to show you some other environment.
There are a lot more space than the most of space
I want to spend the one of the original data set of Noah-- and this is from a precedent prototynth of Photosynth that we did work, to show you what we did to show you what I think about the first time is a real challenges this technology, technology, the technology, technology, the technology, the technology, the technology, and it's not necessarily to the same environment,
We had to worry about the legal and saying it.
This is a reconstruction of the Notare Damames of Notare Damames Flickr. Basta Dame in Flickr. Basta Flickr and you get images of the cleaning challenge, and he sading. Ognize that you can see a picture that it is a picture that is appears a picture that is a picture that it's discovered image that is a little bit of the maintaine.
So I are all pictures from Flickr and were all colleged to space in this way.
And it's possible to navigate in this simple.
You know, I would never have thought of finish to work for Microsoft.
It's very gratification to get this kind of according here.
I think you can see that you can see that it's a lot of different kinds of different kinds of fun fun of the photos in the professional phones of the cell phones in this environment.
And if you can really, I try to look at the strange more strange
Many are tasked, etc.
And in the part here is a series of photographs -- except -- etcol.
This is a Notare of Notare Damam's recortly.
We can go from the places to the physics of this environment.
The essential point is that we can do the social environment. This is taking data from the entire memory of how it apping the hands of view -- and college all of those data together.
All of those pictures become college of the particular of the particular of the particular of the particular picture.
You have a model of the land that emerge.
Think about this as the Stephen Lawler in Stephen Lawler on Earth
It's something that grows in complexity as people using it in the people use. And the people who are using the hands for the us.
Their photograph are honger with other people.
If somebody is the idea of consciousness, and I saw all these kinds of us -- my picture of the Notare Damamames of all of those data, and I can use all of those data, and I can use how point of the instead of the entres in the space of the space of the space in the space of the way-user and have a social experience of the kind of cross-user.
Of course, a consequence of all of the virtual virtual models of all the interesting of the Earth, not only only by view and images and images -- but the memory of the collective and the memory of the collective virtual crows.
Thank you very much.
CA: I understood that I understood well? What your software will confare it to do is that in the next years, all the photographs -- all the photographs are are going to be practically colleged with everybody in the whole world will be are going to be practically colleged together?
BA: Yeah. That's what is doing in practice.
It's creating the hyperline, if you want to be in the images.
And it's doing it in the bottom of the images.
And it becomes very interesting if you think about the recheity of information that many of these images that many of these images are the rectas.
And as you do a research images on the web, you digitline and the head is a lot of information about the web is a lot of information about the pictures of the photos.
Now, what happens if that pictures if that picture?
So the amount of interconnection and the amount of rechethy that is really huge effect of the retas. It's a classic effect.
CA: Blaise, it's really incredible.
BA: Thank you very much.
One of the main pleases when you travels travels of the research is the power of the ethnographic research as the anti-tradition, in the wind of the wind pleting in the wind of the plets of the place and the piogy of the plants.

the consequence of a particular choices that our stird done in our stird of the choices of choices.
And, of course, all share of the essential tracks.
We all all of it. We all procreize.
We are dreams to the beginning.
We have to deal the inexorse of death, so we don't surprised us and ballim --
all of we have a art of it.
What we cope is the retremendous retask of the dog, the rhythm of every culture.
It doesn't matter that are the Earth of the Borneo, or the Voodoo the Voodoo of Haiti, or the Kair in the Kair desert in Kenya settrishal in Kenya settric of the Sahara.
He was my own own own of journey in the desert a month ago, or a hundred yak in the walls of the Qomolangma, the demomother of the world.
All of these people teaching us that there are other ways of thinking about other ways of thinking about other ways of thinking about other ways of moving in the world.
And if you reflect a moment, it's a concept that can give you hope.
And I think of the cultures of the world create a ragnate’s going to be the spiritual and cultural cultural and is important for the bend of the planet, as the regnatela as biosphere.
And you can think about this is the cultural ragnateets as a a cluster of all the ethnose the ethnose of all the conceptive of all the conceptive of all the consciousness, intuitions in the human floor from the consciousness, and it can be from the imagination from the consciousness of the consciousness of the consciousness of all the consciousness, mythy ides
The ethnos: The fantastic patrimonum
It's the symbol's and what we can be in as inquist as inquist inquist of what we can be in the inquist of what we can be in the species of what we can be in the species of what we can be in the species of what we can be in the species of the inquisitive inquist of what we can be in the inquist of what we can be in the inquist of what we can be in the inquist of what we can be in the inquist in the species of the inquist
And sure it as the biosphere is free floor, as it was successed to the ethnose and purch.
No biologist, for example, it would say 50, it would say about the extinction of the simply because it's falk, or -- in the most apocalculation -- in the most apocality, in the most addition -- and not close to the most optimistic hypothic diversity -- that is the most optimistic diversity -- that is the most optimistic diversity -- that is the most optimistic diversity --
The indictable, of course, the perse.
When you're born there were 6,000 languages on this planet.
One language is not just by a vocabolary or from a series of rules of rules.
One language is the should-short spirit of human spirit spirit of the human spirit spirit of the human spirit of the human spirit spirit of human spirit spirit of the human spirit of the human spirit spiri.
It's the meeting with which the animation of every culture comes in the material in the material.
English is a forest of mind, a thinking of mind, a thinking of spiritual system, a though ecosystem of the spiritual system.
And of those 6,000 language, while we are here in Monterey, at least half the half of the children.
They don't get more teacher to the children, which means that it doesn't walk something that are already dead.
What is the most tristop of being avvolved by the silence, to be the last to talk about a language of the equal equipment of the evidence of the equipment of the promise of the promise of the promise of the promise of the kids?
This is a sources of somebody in some part of the world every two weeks of the world every two weeks a wall, and it with the last two weeks of a ancient language.
And I know that somebody will tell you "Is it "Don't you better like this?
The world would be a better place if we talk about the same language?" Okay, then we talk all yoruba. We talk all yoruba.
We talk to kogi.
You really, really, a tract of what it means not to talk about your language.
I would like to do you make you a journey through the etner --
a little journey in the etnos-found such a little bit of what we're lot.
Many of us forget that when I say "different ways of exists of exists that are really different ways of exist.
We take for example this is a Barasan Amazony in Amazony Sepity, the popular of the anaconda, which creates to the midle of the milar sacridge of the skets of the sacrid-sacris.
It's a popular popular that is not able to distinguid the blue crows because the celests is identified in the forest, which depends on the forest, which depends on the wind of the people.
They have a strange strange and a mathematrimonial regular of the language, "You have to be a person that talks about the person that talks about a different language.
And all of this is rooted in the mythological past, all of the particularity is that in these families that are six or linguishing six or lingua.
They listen to listen to and then start talking about it.
We take one of the most interesting tribes with which I lived with any of the Waorans of Ecuador in 1958.
In 1957 mission of 1957 mission of a cometting of a fact that we have a fact that we have a fact that we have a major face.

If you ever see the Yanomami of the Yanomami is sustaining the sustance that are doing from a different species, and they do in the same methoxydimethoxymmethoy:
To be that policy on the nose is a little bit like being sparated by a little bit like being sparated by a chooick and to the electricity of the reality of reality reality of reality, creates the reality. It creates the reality. It creates the reality.
I was often by my professor, Richard Evan Shultes, the man who has done the men who shot the psychedelic, with his discoveries in the 1930s in the 1930s in the 1930s in Mexico.
And I think of my typically you can classified these triptaminos like hallucinoxized to anybody to be told to be able to tell anybody of being hased -- the triamonished. The triamones can be such because they're money in the summer that you find in the intestinosside of the intestinossifashion.
It's possible to assummers only if they asked with other chemical sustances that are money with other chemics that are money with other chemics that are the MAO.
Now it's the beauti: the beautiful better, which is in this book's bitors of MAO, of the same kind of needs to potentiate the trip of 80,000 species of plants -- in a floorder of 80,000 species of plants, as they do not like these popules that are a real deadlick of the golinly not -- but if you get to the result of the particular chemical foot that is a trum of the particular

The solution, you take 17 varieties in a night of a place and each night of a place and each other.
With you don't have to Harvard, but it's much more interesting that is more interesting that we can contare the stames.
Now, the problem is that the problem is that the people who have heart the inner of the peoples are found out in the history of the history of the respect to our respect to our real world and it will spend you.
In fact, 300 years, in 300 years, it will not be reminded for the wars or the sounds or the innovations or innovations or innovations or as we were hoped and we have stopped and we have been stopped in the destruction of biological diversity and cultural diolologic and cultural problem is the change.
All the cultures through the century are involved in a dance for new possibilities of life.
And the problem is not the technology.
Indians have no stopped to be Sioux when they put out of the Sioux when they put out of Americans don't stopped to be Americans have no side of the hort and calmess.
It's not the change or the technology that are the integrity of the ethnos:
The flight during the fact of the domination.
And if you give a look at the world, you will discover that these are not cultures of these are not cultures.
They're living and dynamics out of the existence forces out of the hydynamics that are beyond their capacity of adaptable.
And that is that you can be folding in the patria of the guy --

As the genocide the physics of a popular popul, is convicted to the universal level of a popular popul, but the destle of a popul, not only is not just convicted, but addam, not just convicts, because it makes part of the development.
And you can't understand the suffering of the Tibet until you get part of the beginning.
I lost the 6,000 miles from Chengdu in Western Chinoccial Tibet in Lhasa with a young in Lhasa young with a young in Lhasa I realized the statistics that we were saying what we heard about it.

That is not suggests that we have the answers that we have answers to all the challenges that we should be able to do in the millen.
When you get these hundred cultures of the world is asking to be humans, respond with 10,000 different voices of the world are going to be humans,
And it's in these answers, we all response the possibilities of being what we are the chance of being what we are doing a consciousness and all the popules and all the charge and all the gards can trust of the moments of optimism.
I took this picture on the north of the Baffin, when I went to the Baffin, when I went to the hundred with the Inuit, and this man was told me the wonderful story of his grandfather.
The government canades is not always always as a popular with the Inuit and in the 1950s to stabilies our sound in colonies.
The grandfather's born of this man refused to go to it.
The family, I was in his life, he took all the arms and all of his own attres.
You have to know that Inuit don't care the free of the free they don't care the free of the free --

Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some of some things that I wrote in this book that I hope I hope to the other that you have heard and provide to the college of the college in the case doesn't not.
I want to start with what I call "the dogm official."
The official dogm dog,
The official official societies of all societies the Western societial societial societial societial societies "If we want to be our citizing the well-being is to myze the freedoms to detect the free."
The reason for the late of the fact that the freedom is in the fact that it is preciout, useful, useful, useful, useful, useful, useful, useful, useful for human beings.
On the other is that if we are free, each of us can act to do everybody to do everything that we can do all our well-being, without any one that decide in our name.
The way to massimizing the freedom is to matter the choice.
More choices people hannow, more free is the freedom, more is their freedom, most of the well.
And this is so deeply radicated in society that no one would dreams to put it into the two-flowed it to him.
And it's also proployed in our lives.
I'm going to show you some examples of what the progress has repossible.
This is my supermarket. It's not particularly great.
I allowed a simple named on the injuries for insale.
In my supermarket are 175 conditions, without containing the 10 varieties of olive olive and 12 acets and 12 acets that you can buy you a huge number of condition, that you can buy you a huge number of the instead of the instead of the 15 already already already soon is of your gradiment.
That's the supermarket.
And then you go to the snegotio of electronic to buy a stereere: cassroom, fairly practice.
And in this single negotial of electronic components is a big number of components
We can make six million and a half of different combinations that are in a bunch of different combinations that there are in a negotid.
You need to admit that there's a lot of choice.
Other tricks the world of communications.
Once time, when I was a child -- they could get all the service of the services of the wish, the pack-like celebrate mamma Bell.
He wooked the phone is not buy the phone didn't buy it.
One consequence of that, in the other, was that the telephone doesn't rops the phone don't rop.
These are gone of the day's gone.
We have a variety of telephone almost illimitated phone of the phone -- especially in the cell phone of the cellular cellular cells.
Here's the cellular cellular cellular cells.
My favorite is the MP3, MP3, cut, the MP3, cut, and forces in the hand the short for the cras.
If you do not have seen in the negotiate under the house of the house and rever.
And what the end is that people entering in the negozes and it ask the answer? The answer is "No."
It's not possible to buy a cell that not do too much and what it doesn't do too much and
So in other aspects of life that are much more important than the same explosion of the same explosion of choice.
Assistance, not happening in the United States that you go from the doctor and the doctor and the doctor of the doctor of the doctor of the United States you have to do.
And then you go from doctor, and the doctor says, "Okay, we could do A, or B" "A, you can do it and these risk "B" is these wells and these risks. What does it want?"
You say, "Dr, what would I have to do?"
And the doctor says, "As these risks, and these risks, and Bs these risk."
"What do you want to do?"
And you can rebat, "Dotor if she was me, what to do?"
And the doctor, "But I'm not le."
The result we call it the "malato," expression that it makes it look like a beautiful thing,
But in fact, it's not that one is that one is that one of the responsibility of the decisions that anything knows what it knows s anything that doesn't know -- -- and almost of the other than -- and almost of course is not -- and so not in the ideal conditional decision, and so not in the ideal conditional decisions to make the patient.
There is a huge marketing products of drugs, direct to people like me and you, if you think about you, if you think it doesn't make sense, you know, if you think we don't buy it.
But if we can't buy it because we published them because we publish?
The answer is that they want to do the doctor, we call the doctors for the recipe to change the recipe.
Something that is so fundamental as our identity is a choice, as you see in this view in this -- we don't want to force the children. We don't want to force. We don't want to force. We need to be an identity: we have to make it as a hydly.
And we can reinvent, we can reinvent,
That means that every morning in the answer -- you have to decide that kind of person, you have to be able to be there.
And the family of the family and the mathemates of the perspective of the perspective -- he was that we could get the most pretty possible, and it was going to start the most pretty possible.
The only real choice was with choice was with choice -- and even what to do later, and even what to do later.
Ogame, all is really to play.
I mean, I think, very smart students and I think about 20 percent in less of the respect to a time.
And because they're not bad, because they're less because they're less than because they're less diligents.
but why are I impensiers, I intents I said, "Do I would say I said, "I should do that?"
"I should be able to get a little bit about the time or the career?"
They're interrogatives --
And they try to answer these questions, even if this implements don't completely the compites that are not going to be a good vote to my exam.
And they have to do this. They're important questions.
Now, the work: we are lucky, as Carl subsubsuburban is because the technology we allowed us to work every day, every day, from every day, from Hotel Randolph.
To parents -- there's a angle of the parents and not tell anybody where, where the WiFi works.
I don't tell you why I want to use it.
What does it mean, this incredible liberty liberty that we have about the work? It's that we have to decide -- if we have to working or not.
We can go to see our child play how, with the cell phones in a task in the other, and the Blackberry in the other, and the nest teaches.
And even though they're all speak, every minutes that we see our child we see our child we also ask, "I got to answer this called "Do you to this called this?"
"I have to answer this email? I got to abbounch this letter?"
And even when the answer is "no," all this makes experience the experience of your child very different than what would be in other conditions.
So, from any part of any part of it, little things and big materials and the big objects and stili is a choice, is a choick of choice.
Once the world was this: Of course, there were some of the choice, but it doesn't all have a choice.
The world today is today: "This is the dilemma is, "Is it is a positive thing -- or negative negative or negative no?"
The answer is Sholds of it.
The positive side of the negather, so I'm going to talk about the negatives of the negative set.
All this choice is two negative effects of negative effects on the people.
The first one, paralysize, is that produces paralysis instead of the liberation.
And so many of the other thing that choice, it becomes very difficult to do this.
I offer an example of an example of the study works.
And my college has had access to the Vancertain the Vancertain societies of thought, with about a million clients of thought, with about a million companies.
What she found is that for every 10 percent of every 10 solutions that are offered in the percentage of the floor of the 22 percent.
With 50 sources, there's 100 percent in less of the less of the 10th of the respect of the respect of the respect of the respect of the respect of the respect of the 10. Why?
Because with 50 sources that choice, is maledetail, and the choice, and choices is remaking the ininquestions.
And at the questions, and the questions, and of course questions, and of course not going to move forward --
You know that it doesn't mean that these workers will be able to food for cans because they don't have any money food for cans because they don't have any money or says that decision is so ostick that the decision is so ostick that the decision is so ostick of the work.
They don't parts -- they're losing up to 5000-dollars to the data from the data of the work, which would be well-suned to the them.
So the paralysis of having too many choices.
And I think it makes the world like this.
"And finally, for the eternity: ketch, senaps or major major major major major major major major major major major major major major major major major major major major major major majory?
You would just take the decision that we would be the right decision if it's for the eternity, right?
You don't want to choose the bottom of the wrong and the wrong condition.
So this is the first effect. The second is that even if we could avoid the paralysis and do a choice, we actually get out of the result of how we will be able to be with less options in the result of the chood.
And this for different reasons.
One of these is that with a lot of condition, whether you buy a choose, and it's not perfect and it's not perfect to be better than it would be better than it would be better than it would be better than it would be better than it would be better than it would be better than the choice, and the reduce of choice, and the remains the choice, and the refabrished by the decision of the choice,
even when it was a very good decision.
More choices -- more easier than anybody detail, more than anybody detail, which is insodds.
And yet the economists called opportunity.
Dan Gilbert asked a very well stamack of the things we are the value of the things we confronttive with what we confronts.
And the rest of the when there are many options to represent the characteristics of the alteristic characteristic and be less soddfacts of the option that you can be less sods.
Here's an example. I sent with all of the ones that are not New York.
But that's what probably probably thinking.
There's this copy of the Hamptons.
A place of sus.
It is the splended. Otype day.
Not anything. But what he thinks is "Well, the maledition, is Augosto."
"Everybody all my neighbors in Manhattan are vie."
"I could talk about the front of the front of the front of the house."
And it spends two weeks ahead from the idea that persing -- every day, every day, every day, we can talk to it.
The cost-portunity decrease for what we have, even when the choice is that we have, even when the choice was excellent.
And the most are the options that we have to consider, more than the characteristics will go back to the way as cost-opportunity.
Here's another example.
This view is a lot of things.
And I talk about the moment, and maybe the time to live slow.
But the most important point is that any thing you choice, you choice, you chook not do the others.
The things that we don't choose are four active tass that can make less atter what we do.
Third point: spiral spiral growing expectations of expectations
I tried on my skin my skin a couple of jeans.
I got to almost jeans.
Once jeans were a top, and they were bought to buy and westive it and westive them a lot of times, only after they took a lot of times a lot of times to go well.
So I went to buy a couple of a couple when the old old old were ganded, and I said, "I need a couple of jeans, this is my cut."
And the come, "See wants me to slim -- asy Frelaxed -- relaxed fit?"
He wants to do you want to the cernier bottons? "Wited" or ""Wed" or "?
"Well it wants to do you do that?"
"Of course the broken or stretch, you know, the blay? Bla -- -- he was going to be elense
I was going to sleep, and after a little bit I could say, "I want to say, "I want to the typopo" -- he was the only one guy -- he had no idea that I was so so so I tried to all of the stands of the stands of the negotie, with the best couple of jeans that I had ever done to it.
It was the simple one of the choice had a choice had the best chop the ball.
But I felt I was worse.
Why? I wrote a book for the whole whole of understanding.
The reason I was worse that I was worse with all that choices were altissue were altish altish -- the jeans had to be perfects.
I had expectations I didn't expect me exceptional when it was just a type of the top, but when you saw 100 different in the type of the type of it had to be perfect.
What I had water was good -- but not perfect.
After I talked about what I was trying to insodded with what I was trying to insodddrop in the waiting.
The add of options in the life of people don't form to increase the expectations that these are respectacs of the options.
And this will make less soddiscovered when the results are good ones.
No one in the world of marketing if you make it content.
Because if you know what I'm talking about, you know, what I'm talking about.
The most assumption.
"He was better when he was worse when he was wors." The reason he was worse when he was worse when he was worse when he was worse when he was worse was possible to meet place to be able to meet of pleasures.
Ogame, in the world where we live -- opulents, industrialized citizens with the perfection -- the massive that we can hope is that the things are in the height.
You never have to be sursursurprised because your vostage because of the middle expectative, you have ingigant.
The secret of happiness -- what you're here -- "Baspectack."
I want to say -- little time I mean, I really want to say -- which is really unbelieve, and my wife is really stuff is really stuff --
I could not have to do better and I didn't have any other people.
But you can account is not always a bad thing,
And finally, a consequence of jeans of jeans when there's only that kind of jeans is that when you don't know when you're sunfolds you are not such and ask you "Why?"
"Who is responsible responsible to it.
The world is responsible responsible for us?
When there are hundreds of jeans, and you buy a little bit of a jeans, and ask you who is responsible to you who is responsible as you are to be as much as you are as a responsible for you to you.
You could do it better.
With hundreds of varieties are not going to be able for the insuccess.
So when people take decisions, even if the result is valized valize, you feel insods and damn the same.
In the last years the depression is exploded in the industrialized world
I believe that a fact that a fact that a fact that the unique, but important -- of this depression is that people have experiences the deluds are too high.
And when they have to explain this situation thinking that the colpe is there.
So the end result is that in general we are better -- but we feel objectively but we feel worse about it.
Let me tell you that you remember it.
This is the offical dog, what we all take for good and it's completely false.
There is no doubt that a little bit of choice, but it doesn't have a little bit better than that I don't have a lot better than a little bit better than a little bit of a little bit better than a little bit of a little bit better than a little bit of a little bit of a little bit better than that they don't have a little bit of choick choice.
There's a critical value of critical value. I don't know what it is.
But I'm sure we have now now now that we have superfrom a piece that we have the best choices in our life.
Now, from the political point of view -- I almost finished -- from the policy is the follow.
What allows you to all this choice in the industrial societies is the material.
There are many places in the world, and you know about it, where the problem isn't that choice.
The problem is that they too popular too popular is that they have too popular too popular is that they have too popul.
So the face that I'm talking about is a malesclusive to be a disease, reclusive societies.
And what it does depress and arrabbing is this: Steve Levitt talked about how those costs and seats are under and seats for bird bi seats to be useful.
I want to say that these choices, complicated and dispendous, it's not that they just useful.
They're deleters.
They make it worse.
If a little bit of what in our societies allows to be reversed in those where people are too point, it would not just be their own own better life to be better than the now.
This is what economists call a better exists are a better existing pareties.
One red-red-red-red-to--- not just the poor poor -- because of this choices in except that it comes back to us.
And he said, "Oh, you can become everything that you want, "...
You know, people are culture, you think, "But what believes that fish the fishh of the fisher?"
"It's obvious that you can't make anything in a mouse of vetrocket."
"As the cast, a limited view of the world."
and I got the interpreted, in the beginning.
But then, I think about that, instead, I realized that that the fish room.
Because the reality of the facts is that if you eat the franks, so that "all it is possible." You can't get the freedom. You get the freedom.
If you rops the mouse that everything becomes possible to be possible to be able to decrease the mouse of the mouth despacing.
You can get the parals, and you reduce the well-bee.
They need a spell.
This is almost of course, almost most most extremely too strong, and sure for us.
But the absolute of some symbolic symbolic electure, for the road of the involved for the road of the wine.
Thank you very cuor.
