<unk> year I showed these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, which for about three million years had the size of the United States <unk>, it was <unk> of 40 percent.
<unk> this <unk> the <unk> of the problem because it doesn't show the ice <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> is, in a sense, the heart <unk> of the global system.
It's <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
The next <unk> will be a <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of the last 25 years.
<unk> <unk> are <unk> in red.
You see, it's <unk> to the blue <unk>.
That's the ice in <unk>, which is <unk> <unk> summer.
You can see that the <unk> ice <unk>, five years, is like the blood here, which is <unk> from the body.
In 25 years it's been so that.
This is a problem because the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> around the ocean <unk> where there are huge <unk> of <unk> <unk> that, <unk>, come <unk>, are being <unk> in <unk> by the <unk>.
<unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk>, that <unk> could be <unk>, <unk> this point of not <unk>.
In some <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> is already <unk> from the water.
The <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>! <unk>: She's fine. The question is, it's good.
A reason is that this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from the north.
This is a river in <unk> <unk>.
<unk> had never <unk> like this.
This is the <unk> river, in the <unk> of <unk>.
If you want to know how the <unk> <unk> <unk> on the sea <unk> for the <unk> of <unk> on <unk>, here is where it <unk>.
These <unk> are <unk> <unk>.
<unk> else on the planet: <unk>, the biggest <unk> of ice on the planet.
<unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> scientists have <unk> that the <unk> of the ice is in <unk>, and that <unk> on some <unk> <unk>, is particularly <unk> in <unk>.
<unk> <unk> feet of the <unk>, like in <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk> of ice, you see new <unk>, which few years ago were <unk>.
<unk> percent of the world's population <unk> half of the <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>: this <unk> is the source of water <unk> of this city.
<unk> is <unk>.
But when you <unk>, the same happens to the water.
In California, <unk> on the <unk> <unk> is 40 percent.
<unk> <unk> are in the crisis.
<unk>, as you read, they're <unk>.
<unk> <unk> in the world brings to a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> are <unk> to a <unk> outside the normal and not <unk>.
Sometimes, more <unk> in the last 30 years, <unk> <unk>.
This is a <unk> of everything.
If you look in the <unk> context, they can see the <unk>.
In the last five years, we've been <unk> 70 million <unk> of CO2 in the ocean every day.
Look at the area of the <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and on both <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, where there's a <unk> <unk> of oxygen in the ocean.
The biggest one of the global <unk>, together to the <unk>, which is 20 percent, is the use of <unk> <unk>.
<unk> is a problem, and <unk> is even worse.
The United States is one of the two countries with more emissions, together with China.
And they <unk> to build many other <unk> <unk>.
But we're <unk> to a <unk> of the direction.
These are the projects <unk> in the last years, and some <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
And so, there's a <unk> politics in our country.
<unk> <unk> and oil <unk> have <unk> <unk> million dollars in the last year to <unk> <unk> <unk>, which is a <unk>.
<unk> image me, I would something --
<unk> <unk>, in <unk>, where I live, there was a <unk> of <unk> billion <unk> <unk>.
Maybe you saw it on the <unk>.
This is the second biggest flow of <unk> in America.
It's happened around <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> of one of the <unk> <unk> was this.
<unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk> is a <unk> and happy.
It's <unk> here in America, and it makes our economy.
<unk> the <unk> is more <unk> and more <unk>.
It's in <unk>, <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Al <unk>: <unk>, from here's a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The biggest <unk> <unk> society on the <unk> is <unk> <unk>. This is his <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> -- don't know what they're talking about.
Al <unk>: So the <unk> for the <unk> of <unk> has <unk> two <unk>.
This is one of them, one part.
<unk>: <unk>: <unk> <unk> we see the <unk> changes as a <unk> <unk> to our business.
So for this <unk> our <unk> is <unk> a lot of money in a <unk> <unk> to make public public <unk> and <unk> the truth.
In fact, <unk> is not <unk>.
We think it's <unk> -- it also a good <unk>.
So we don't know about climate change.
We want to do it.
<unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk> -- you've heard a lot of it.
So we <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk>.
<unk>! <unk> are a little <unk>, but this is the sound of the technology of <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> is between the major <unk> of global <unk>, but <unk> technology <unk> that you see changes everything.
Let's look: this is the <unk> technology <unk>.
Al <unk>: <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to the economic <unk> and the national security <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> is <unk> America is in the crisis; the economy, national <unk> crisis.
The <unk> that <unk> all: our <unk> from the <unk> <unk>, like <unk> and oil <unk>.
But now, there's a new <unk>, <unk> solution to it.
<unk> America: 100 percent of <unk> energy, in 10 years.
A plan to <unk> America at work, <unk> more <unk>, and help <unk> global <unk>.
<unk>, a solution that is to solve our problems.
<unk> America. <unk> more.
Al <unk>: This is the last.
<unk>: <unk> <unk>: It's about <unk> energy to America.
One of the most <unk> ways of <unk> <unk> <unk> on the planet.
<unk>: The future is here. <unk>, <unk>, a new <unk> network.
<unk> <unk> two: <unk> <unk> <unk> for jobs <unk> <unk>
<unk>: <unk> America. It's time to be <unk>.
Al <unk>: A old <unk> <unk> says, "If you want to go <unk>, you go from alone.
If you want to go far, you go. "
We have to go far, quickly.
Thank you very much.
<unk> year at TED I did an <unk> on <unk>.
And they're trying to <unk> it to <unk> how the machine works.
So I'm here. And for those who were not, the <unk> is the biggest scientific <unk> experiment ever <unk> -- <unk>.
His task is to <unk> the conditions that were in the <unk> of a second from the beginning of the universe -- to <unk> millions of times a second.
That's just <unk>.
This is the <unk> machine.
<unk> these <unk> <unk> into the <unk>.
This is what I work on. It's called <unk> -- <unk> feet and it has a <unk> <unk>.
This is an <unk> image of <unk> in <unk>, so you can see the <unk>.
<unk> <unk> last year we've <unk> the machine for the first time.
And this picture was <unk> by <unk>.
It was <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> room.
It's an image of the first <unk> of particles that had done everything around the <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, with a part of the <unk>, and <unk> particles inside the <unk>.
In other words, when I <unk> that image the 10 <unk>, I <unk> that the machine <unk>, which is a great <unk>.
I don't know if it was this to do more or this, when somebody <unk> on Google and <unk> the page <unk> was this.
That means we've had a <unk> <unk> <unk> to that scientific impact.
<unk> a week later, there was a problem with the car, we had to just these <unk> here -- these <unk> <unk>.
These <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> when the car works at the <unk> of the <unk>.
Now, the <unk> <unk> of you <unk> the <unk> and <unk>, "it's not true. I'm too <unk>."
And they can do that because when they're very <unk> become the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
So <unk> <unk> degrees, at least <unk> degrees, at a <unk> temperature <unk> to the stars, these <unk> can bring that <unk>.
In one of the <unk> <unk> <unk>, there was a <unk> <unk>.
So the <unk> <unk>, and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This was the result.
Now, this is even more <unk> if you think that these <unk> <unk> more than 20 <unk>, and they've been <unk> about 30 <unk>.
They <unk> about 50 <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, what we then did.
We <unk> them and <unk>.
Now, they're all <unk> to their <unk> place.
<unk> the end of <unk> <unk> is going to be new <unk>.
<unk> it, and we decided to get <unk> data to <unk> or <unk>, and <unk> so our <unk> to find out what the universe is.
Now, of course, in a way, these <unk> <unk> the <unk> of science and engineering engineering engineering engineering of <unk>. It's easy to <unk>.
I think the fact that it's so hard, the fact that it's the value of things like <unk>.
I'd like to end with the words of a <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, who, <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> was Michael <unk>, he said, "No so <unk> about the progress of the human mind as the <unk> of the ideas of science are <unk>, that there are no <unk>, and there are no <unk> in nature, that our <unk> are <unk>, and that there are no <unk>, and that there's no <unk> <unk>."
Thank you.
I want to start <unk> <unk> to when, from children, <unk> with <unk>.
<unk> <unk> like <unk> and <unk>, <unk> and <unk> and <unk>, <unk>, actually to think and solve <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> <unk> to the way that we <unk> most of the world around us.
So, from <unk> <unk> of our <unk> <unk> with <unk> objects, together with my <unk> <unk>, and my <unk> <unk> <unk>, I started <unk>, "And if we use a computer, instead of having the only <unk> of the <unk> as digital <unk> that moves on a <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with information with a <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with information,
and we <unk> to our <unk>?
The question was so interesting that I decided to explore the answer, building <unk>.
In a few words, a <unk> is a <unk> computer as a <unk>.
In a few words, a <unk> is a <unk> computer as a <unk>.
You can <unk> them with the hand, they can <unk>, and they feel their movement and they have a <unk> <unk>.
But <unk>, they're <unk> objects, like <unk>, you can just <unk>.
<unk> are the example of a new <unk> of tools to <unk> information.
And as they become more <unk>, <unk> of their movement, other, and they <unk>, and they <unk> as <unk> as <unk>, <unk>, of the <unk>, of the movement, of how we can explore new <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
I'll start with some simple example.
This <unk> is <unk> to show <unk>: if you put it in a direction, the <unk> <unk>, so if you put it in a direction, you can go back.
These <unk> <unk> are <unk> of others.
If you <unk> them, you know what it's going to be around.
If they come up, they can <unk> it and they can <unk> it a little bit.
If they come up, they can <unk> it and they can <unk> it a little bit.
They also <unk> their movement and <unk>.
We've got to realize that one of the interesting <unk> was that we could use common <unk> on data, for example, "<unk> color as if it was a <unk>.
In this case, we have three <unk> <unk> as a <unk> <unk> and I can <unk> <unk> to <unk> color, where you <unk>.
and I can <unk> it to <unk> color in the <unk>, where they <unk>.
We can <unk> too much, we can <unk> it a little bit.
There's also a chance of <unk>, like <unk>, <unk> and <unk> <unk> where people can try things things, and <unk> <unk>, where people can try things quickly, and <unk> the results immediately.
Now I'm now --
This is a <unk> sequence that I do with a <unk> program.
Here we have a <unk> of words that is <unk> half <unk> and <unk>.
<unk>, at every <unk> <unk> a letter on every <unk>, <unk>, every <unk>, <unk>, every <unk> <unk> a letter on every <unk>, and while I I was <unk> <unk> to <unk> it.
Then, after about 30 seconds, you get <unk>, and you have a new <unk> of <unk> and new <unk> <unk> to try.
Thank you.
Here's what the kids were <unk> in <unk> <unk>, I did so that I <unk> them and I <unk> them a video.
They're very very <unk>.
And one of the interesting things about this kind of <unk> is that you don't have to give people many <unk>.
I just say, "<unk> <unk>," and they know exactly what to do.
Here's a lot of other people who <unk> it.
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
It actually wanted to <unk>.
They were just <unk>, for him.
Now, this is an <unk> of a <unk> <unk>.
<unk> building a <unk> for the <unk> of the <unk>. He's <unk>.
It can <unk> new characters in the scene, <unk> their <unk>.
It can <unk> new characters in the scene, <unk> their <unk>.
Here, he's, he's <unk>.
<unk>: The sun is <unk>.
David <unk>: Now he brought a <unk> in the scene.
<unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> work! Yes!
So we <unk> the <unk> and <unk> can <unk> the characters --
<unk>: <unk>!
and <unk> your story.
<unk>: <unk>!
<unk>: It's a story with the <unk>, and it can decide him as it <unk>.
<unk>: It's a story with the <unk>, and it can decide him as it <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>, <unk>.
<unk>: The last example I have time I've got time to show you is a <unk>, which was recently recently, to <unk> and <unk> music.
it's a <unk>, they've been <unk>, to <unk> and <unk> music.
The <unk> here are <unk> by <unk> <unk>, and <unk>.
<unk> of these have four different <unk>, and you can choose which I use.
You can also <unk> these <unk> in a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And they just <unk> by making a <unk>, "sound" and a <unk>. "
These are the effects that you can control the live, like <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> it to a particular sound and then <unk> to <unk> it.
And then there's the <unk> effects of time and <unk>, <unk> to the entire sequence.
<unk> like it works.
<unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk>, "the <unk> in a series, the <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
Now we're going to take a <unk> line.
<unk>: <unk> <unk>: Now I'm going to <unk> <unk> --
<unk>: <unk>: And now I'm going to <unk> the <unk> to the <unk>, so I can control the effect of the live.
<unk>: <unk>: I can <unk> the whole time <unk> <unk> <unk> from one side or the other.
<unk>: <unk>: And now I'm going to <unk> the bottom to give more <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>: I can <unk> the sequence "<unk>."
So I don't have to <unk> before, but I can <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
And now, finally, I can <unk> the whole <unk> <unk> sequence on the left left the <unk> <unk>.
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is to build new <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to how our brain works and body.
And today, I've had time to show you one of the results of this <unk>, and some possibilities we try to try to get out of the <unk>.
The concept I want to <unk> is that it's going to <unk> this new generation of <unk> objects to <unk> media, which <unk> information in our world in the way we want.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the time I'm going to talk to all of you.
I'm a <unk>.
<unk> books is my <unk>, but it's more than that, of course.
It's also the love and the <unk> of my life.
And I don't look like that it can change.
But, I said this, something particular happened happened in my life and my career, which has brought me to <unk> the whole relationship with this work.
The particular thing is I <unk> wrote this book, this <unk> called "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
And the result is that everywhere <unk> now, people <unk> me as if I was <unk>.
<unk> -- <unk>, <unk>!
I'm going to come up and they say, "You don't fear you don't get <unk> to do it better?
You don't fear to keep all of the life that we can make a book that could help help someone? "
What can you do? "
It's <unk>, you know.
But it could go worse, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> me, more than 20 years ago, when I started to say to people -- I was a <unk> -- I wanted to be a <unk>.
I was <unk> at the same <unk> <unk> by fear.
And people said, "Don't you know I couldn't be able to be able to be successful?
You don't fear that the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>?
You're not afraid to do this <unk> for all life without anything to be <unk> out and you die of a <unk> of <unk> <unk>? "
So, you know.
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is, "Yes."
Yeah, I'm afraid of all those things.
I always had fear.
And I also fear of many other things that people couldn't <unk>.
How <unk> and other things <unk>.
But, as much as I thought I was writing what I thought and <unk> <unk> is why?
Is it <unk>?
It's <unk> that anybody who <unk> <unk> to be <unk> by a job that you feel used to be <unk> to do.
But what is this particular is in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in a way that other <unk> do not do?
Like my father, for example, he was a <unk> <unk> and I couldn't remember one time in his <unk> <unk>, when asked them to be <unk>?
It was never -- that <unk> of John, how it goes?
<unk>'t you like this, <unk>?
<unk>, engineers <unk> like a group of engineers, like a <unk>, <unk> the <unk> of being <unk> <unk>.
We <unk>, we have enough this <unk>, and not just <unk>, but <unk> of all sorts, we have this <unk> to be <unk> <unk>.
And it's not <unk> else that look at the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that, only in the <unk> century, <unk> young and often as.
And the ones that are not <unk> seem to be really <unk> by their <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, before he died, in the last <unk> said, "Every book has me a little bit more <unk> about the work of their life.
But we didn't know when we <unk> it, because we've been so long as we've got these things so much we've <unk> and <unk> the <unk> that creativity and creativity is, in some <unk> way, and the art, at the end, <unk>.
And the question I want to <unk> all here is: you agree with this idea?
It's OK, because it also <unk> by a <unk> of <unk> to me, it's not good for anything that <unk>.
I think it's <unk>.
And I think it's also <unk> and I don't want to <unk> <unk> in the next century.
I think it's better <unk> our great <unk> <unk> to live.
And I certainly know that, in my case -- it would be very <unk> to start <unk> to start <unk> to that <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> the <unk> that I'm in my career.
<unk> -- <unk> look, I'm pretty young, I've been pretty young, I've got 40 years.
I still have about four <unk> of work in me.
And it's very <unk> that anything <unk> <unk> in now, it's going to be <unk> by the world like the work that <unk> after the <unk> success of my last book.
<unk> <unk>, because we're all kind of <unk>, because we're all about my biggest success is to my <unk>.
Oh, <unk>, what thought!
You know, the kind of thought that brings a person to start <unk> <unk> at nine in the morning, and I don't want to do it.
I love to continue to do this work that I love.
So, the question becomes, how?
And so I think, after many <unk>, that the way of work to continue to write is the one of the way to work to keep on on the <unk> <unk>, OK?
I've got to have to come up with a distance of <unk> between me, and my natural <unk> on which is written about what <unk> <unk>. And while I was going to get it all last year models of how to do it, looking through the time, looking for other societies to see if you could have the best ideas and <unk>.
about how to help people <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity.
And that research brought me to the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
<unk> because they <unk> in <unk> and then they go back.
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> -- people don't believe that creativity that creativity <unk> <unk> from men, OK?
It was <unk> that creativity was this <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> to men from some <unk> <unk> and <unk>, for <unk> <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> these <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of creativity. "
<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, you know, you've got a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> were the same idea, but <unk> the <unk> of that kind of spirit of without a <unk>.
And the <unk> is <unk>, because the <unk> didn't really believe that a <unk> was somebody particularly.
<unk> that <unk> was this kind of <unk> <unk> <unk> that was literally <unk> in the <unk> of the study of a artist, a little bit like <unk>, and <unk> out of <unk> <unk> the work.
<unk> <unk> <unk>.
And everybody <unk> that was so <unk>, right?
So, <unk> artists were <unk> by <unk> things, like the too <unk>, right?
If your work was <unk>, you don't <unk> <unk> all the <unk>, all <unk> that <unk> state of this <unk> <unk>.
If your <unk> work, it was not all your <unk>, right?
Everybody <unk> that was your <unk> to be a <unk>.
And so people <unk> <unk> creativity in <unk> for a long time.
And then the <unk> <unk> and everything, and we <unk> this great idea; we put the human center over the universe, and the <unk> and the <unk> and <unk> and not leave space to leave <unk> by <unk>.
This was the <unk> <unk> <unk> and people started thinking that creativity is <unk> <unk> from <unk>.
And for the first time in history, they <unk> to this or the artist as a rather <unk> <unk> than a person with <unk>.
And I have to <unk>, I think it was a big <unk>.
I think that <unk> to someone, a simple person who I believe that I would be like a <unk> like a source, <unk> and <unk> of all <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> is a responsibility for responsibility to <unk> human <unk>.
It's like you ask someone to <unk> the sun.
<unk> and <unk> and <unk> completely <unk> and <unk> all these <unk> <unk> on the <unk>.
And I think it was this pressure to have <unk> artists in the <unk> 500 years.
And, if this is true, and I think it's true, the question it becomes, and now?
Can we <unk> it?
I could go back to a more <unk> understanding of the relationship between humans and <unk> <unk>.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we can't <unk> 500 years of thinking about <unk> in a <unk> talk about 18 minutes.
And there's probably people in the audience who <unk> <unk> <unk> on their <unk>, <unk>, you <unk> people <unk> <unk> on their projects.
You probably don't <unk> you all about this.
But the question I'd like to ask you is -- why not?
Why don't we <unk> this way?
Because it has more sense of everything that I ever heard to explain the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> process.
A process that, as anyone who ever <unk> to do something -- so, basically, all here -- knows, you know, you know, you don't <unk> <unk>.
And in fact, it can be completely <unk>.
I did this meeting <unk> with the extraordinary <unk> <unk> <unk>, who has now 90 years, but it was a <unk> for all life and said that during his <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> out in the <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk> it, <unk> it, and <unk> it, in it, if, when a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
He said, he was like a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And that <unk> <unk> towards her <unk>.
And I was <unk>, because he <unk> the land under his feet.
I thought I had one thing to do to that point and it was, words, "<unk> like a <unk>."
And so he went to the house and he was <unk> by this <unk>, and it wouldn't have to do anything that take a piece of paper and a <unk> enough quickly to, while the <unk>, <unk> and <unk> on the page.
<unk> times I couldn't be enough, so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and she would <unk> the <unk> through and she would <unk> through the <unk>, looking, like she said, "another <unk>."
And then there were those times -- this piece never -- there was never <unk> it -- there was <unk> times when it was almost <unk>, OK?
So, he was <unk> at home and he was looking for paper and the <unk> <unk> through, and he <unk> a <unk> right in the while he was <unk>, and then he was like he <unk> with the other hand and <unk>.
<unk> the <unk> from the tail and the <unk> in his body and the <unk> on the page.
And in these cases, the <unk> would be <unk> on the <unk> page and <unk> but <unk>, the <unk> word to the first word to the first word to the first.
So when I <unk> it -- it's <unk>, it's exactly <unk> to my <unk> process.
Not all my <unk> process -- I'm not a <unk>!
I'm a <unk>, and my way of <unk> is; I'm going to go on on the same <unk> every day and <unk> and work on and <unk> on the <unk>.
But even me in my <unk>, I <unk> against that thing, sometimes.
And I <unk> that many of you <unk> the <unk>.
You know, even though the work and ideas I would <unk> me from a source I couldn't <unk> <unk>.
And what is this thing?
And how can we <unk> it in it way that we don't have to <unk> your head, but rather, what does it <unk> <unk>?
So, as I'm the best example, I've been the <unk> <unk> <unk>, which I've <unk> several years ago for a <unk>.
I was talking about this, and you know, <unk>, for the <unk> of life was the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, trying to control, <unk>, <unk> these <unk> <unk> <unk>.
But then <unk>, he was <unk>, and one day while while he was <unk> on a <unk> <unk>, <unk> everything for him.
<unk> <unk> and everything of a <unk> <unk> this little <unk> of <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and the <unk>, and the <unk>, but it doesn't know how to <unk>.
It's not a <unk> of paper, it's not a <unk>, it's not a <unk>.
So it starts to feel this kind of old <unk> <unk> <unk> in him, "I'm going to lose, and <unk> <unk> <unk> from this song.
I'm not enough <unk> and I can't <unk> it. "
And instead of going to go into the <unk>, they <unk>.
<unk> the whole <unk> process and made something completely new.
He just <unk> the sky and said, "<unk>, you don't see I'm <unk>?"
"Do you feel that it can write a song now?
If you really want to <unk>, you'll be more <unk> when I can take care of you.
<unk>, <unk> to <unk> more today.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. "
And his process <unk> <unk> after this.
Not the work, it's still <unk> as always.
But the process, and the <unk> <unk> that was <unk> when they <unk> the <unk>, the <unk> that the <unk> out of the problems and <unk> it back to where, <unk> it comes from, and <unk> it back to where, <unk> that it was <unk> and <unk>.
but I had this <unk>, wonderful <unk> <unk> <unk> a conversation between <unk> and this <unk> thing that was <unk> and <unk> <unk>, but it was not <unk>.
So how I <unk> that story is to change a little bit of the way I <unk> and I've already <unk> me.
This idea, I was <unk> when I was <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>," and I <unk> it into one of the <unk> that we all're working on something and we can't do it and we can start thinking that it's going to be a <unk>, that's going to be the <unk>, that's going to be the <unk>.
Not just <unk>, just <unk>, just the <unk> book.
And we started thinking about <unk> this project.
But then I <unk> <unk> that <unk> the air and <unk> us.
So I <unk> my face on the <unk> and I <unk> my <unk> to a <unk> <unk> of the room.
And I said to <unk>, "<unk>, what, we know, we know that if this book is not going to be <unk>, no?
Because as you see, I'm <unk> everything I have, I don't have any more of this.
So if you want it to be better, you have to <unk> and do your <unk>.
Okay. But if you don't do it, you know what, don't do it.
I started writing the same because it's my work.
And I would like to say, I would say that I'd <unk> to do my part of "Because -- at the end is so, OK -- <unk> it's in the Africa of the <unk> of the moon, people <unk> to the <unk> <unk>.
And they were always <unk>, because the <unk> were <unk> and they were <unk>.
But every so, <unk>, something <unk>, and one of these <unk> artists actually <unk>.
And I know what I talk, because I know what I've all seen, at some point, a <unk> like this.
It was like the time, and the <unk> <unk> through a kind of <unk> and it was not doing anything else else else that's usually, like the <unk> first, but everything was <unk>.
And all of a sudden we don't just like a human.
But it <unk> from <unk> and <unk> <unk> in the fire of <unk>.
And when this <unk>, at the time, people <unk> what was, he <unk> him with his name.
I <unk> hands and I went to <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, God,"
That's God, you know.
<unk> <unk> <unk> -- when the <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the <unk>, I <unk> this <unk> with them and the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>," <unk>, <unk>, "which you can feel in the <unk> or in the <unk>.
In <unk>, when a artist has done something impossible and <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>," <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> -- a <unk> of God.
And it's <unk> because we need it.
But the problem comes the day, the <unk> comes up and <unk> that are <unk> and <unk> <unk> that are <unk> 11 <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> of God. There's no more.
It's just a <unk> <unk> with <unk>, and maybe never <unk> to <unk> that <unk> to the <unk>.
And maybe nobody <unk> the name of God still, and what does it have to do with the rest of his life?
It's hard.
This is one of the <unk> <unk> to do in a <unk> life.
But maybe it doesn't have to be so <unk> if you can't believe, <unk>, <unk> the most <unk> of your being <unk> from yourself.
But I just <unk> that you get data from a <unk> source of this <unk> part of your life that you have to go to <unk>.
And, you know, if we think it's this way everything is.
And so I started <unk>, and it's what I <unk> for several months during the <unk> of the book that I was soon, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> of my <unk> success.
And what I have to continue to <unk> when I feel like this is, I'm not afraid to be.
Don't <unk>. <unk> only your work.
<unk> <unk> for your <unk>, any <unk> can be.
If your work is <unk>, <unk>.
If the <unk>, you would <unk> to you <unk> some kind of <unk>, <unk> some kind of <unk>, for one moment through your <unk>, then "<unk>!"
<unk>, you do the same your <unk>.
And "<unk>!" <unk>! "
I think, and I think it's <unk> <unk>.
"<unk>!" <unk> "at you the same, just for <unk> <unk> love and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk>: <unk>!
You know, as you know, some of these projects on the human genome, what it can <unk> and the discovery of new genes.
Now we're going to take a new path: we started <unk> biology and now from that digital code, we're <unk> into a new <unk> of biology, <unk> and <unk> life.
We always tried to <unk> <unk> great questions.
"What is life?" It's something that many <unk>, I think they have <unk> to understand various levels.
We tried different <unk>, <unk> to the <unk> terms of <unk>.
We're <unk> from almost 20 years.
When we <unk> the human genome to go from the <unk> world of biology to the digital world.
Now, what can we <unk> life, or create new life from this digital universe?
This is the map of a little <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, which is the <unk> species from the <unk> genome between those that can <unk> in the lab.
And we tried to reduce the genome to <unk> one even smaller.
We're able to <unk> a <unk> of about 500 that I'm here.
But when we look at the <unk> map, it's just <unk> <unk> than our.
<unk>, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can <unk>, one at a time, it's very <unk> that this can bring a <unk> cell.
So I thought the only way to <unk> was <unk> this <unk> to <unk> this <unk> <unk> the <unk> to <unk> some of these questions.
And so we started the <unk> of "We can <unk> a <unk>?"
Can the chemistry <unk> of making these big molecules that we've never been able to create these big molecules we've never been able to create these big molecules that we've never been able to create these big molecules that we've never been able to create these big molecules that we've never been able
And, in case, can we work a <unk>?
A <unk> is just a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The speed with which we're able to <unk> life is <unk> to <unk> <unk>.
Our <unk> <unk> code, instead, <unk> rather slowly, but it's <unk>.
And our <unk> <unk> <unk> on a <unk> <unk>.
We've been <unk> over 15 years ago.
The process has <unk> a lot of <unk>, <unk> with a <unk> <unk> before they <unk> the experiments.
But we found that <unk> DNA is very hard.
There are <unk> of thousands of cars in the world that <unk> little <unk> of DNA <unk>, <unk> <unk>, and it's a <unk> process. <unk> <unk> is more <unk>, the <unk> is long, more <unk> there are.
So we had to develop a new <unk> to <unk> these <unk> and <unk> the <unk>.
And this was our first <unk>, starting information <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's a small virus that <unk> bacteria.
We designed <unk>, we <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> a <unk> of DNA about <unk> <unk>.
The interesting part is when we took this piece of <unk> <unk> <unk> and we <unk> it in bacteria, bacteria have <unk> to read this code and <unk> the <unk> particles.
<unk> particles have been <unk> by cells, they're <unk> back and they <unk> the <unk> <unk>.
I talked about recently with <unk> members of the <unk> <unk> industry that they've certainly <unk> this model.
They have more of you.
I think this is a situation where the software can actually build its <unk> <unk> into a <unk> system.
But we could do the biggest things in the biggest things.
<unk>: <unk> the entire <unk> of <unk>.
They're more than <unk> <unk> of <unk> code.
So we thought we were <unk> <unk> of size, so we can change the <unk> to understand what the <unk> of a <unk> cell.
<unk> is <unk>, and if you <unk> information with information in a computer, they have to be very <unk>.
When I <unk> this genome for the first time in <unk>, it was a <unk> for every 10 <unk> <unk>.
We've discovered, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>. If we were <unk> that original <unk> <unk> never been able to do it.
A part of the process is design <unk> 50 <unk> that <unk> with all the other <unk> of the other <unk> of the <unk> to build smaller <unk> <unk>.
<unk> elements here.
You probably read that <unk> us of <unk>.
<unk> <unk>: we have a <unk> <unk> code on four <unk>: A, <unk>, <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
<unk> of those <unk> <unk> together, about 20 <unk>, and there's a <unk> order to <unk> every <unk>.
So we can use the <unk> code for writing words, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
What we did was <unk>.
Some of them were <unk> by the fact that it was not <unk>.
We designed these <unk> to <unk> simply <unk> with <unk>.
There's <unk> that <unk> them and <unk> them.
And we started <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to them to them <unk>.
But anyway, we have produced these <unk> in <unk> so that we're trying to create a extremely <unk> <unk>, because you're going to see in a minute.
We're trying to <unk> the process.
So this looks like a <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
When I started these <unk> very <unk>, more than 100 <unk> <unk>, they don't get <unk> directly to the <unk> <unk>.
It's <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk>.
So we've been <unk> some other <unk>.
<unk> of another <unk> called <unk> <unk>, which in biology <unk> to <unk> DNA that <unk> to <unk> the <unk>.
Here's an example.
This <unk>, called <unk> <unk>, can <unk> three million <unk> <unk> of <unk>.
You can see in the <unk> <unk> like his <unk> <unk> <unk>.
In 12 -- it's <unk> exactly like it was before.
<unk> thousands of organisms that are able to do this.
These organisms can <unk> completely completely.
We could have to live under <unk>.
I'm absolutely absolutely sure that life <unk> in space, and you're <unk> to find new <unk> <unk> of water.
<unk>, NASA showed that this is happening.
This is an image of the <unk> we've built using these <unk>, just using the <unk> with the <unk> <unk> with the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> <unk> them.
This image was not <unk> with a <unk> <unk>, but with a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's such a <unk> <unk> that we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk>.
These are pictures that <unk> a period of about six seconds.
This is the <unk> we've done a little time ago.
They're more than <unk> <unk>.
It's the biggest <unk> of a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It has a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
If we <unk> it with a <unk> 10, and we just <unk> pages to just <unk> this code.
Now, how do we work? How can we <unk> it?
<unk>, of course, through a <unk> <unk> is a <unk> <unk>.
It's a little bit more <unk> when you use bacteria.
It's more simple when it comes to <unk> cells like our: you can just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> another, which is basically the process of <unk>.
In <unk>, the <unk> is instead <unk> in the cell, but we've got <unk> <unk> that we can make a <unk> <unk> of a <unk> from a <unk> to another cell to another and <unk>.
We <unk> a <unk> <unk> from a kind of <unk>.
<unk> are two different <unk> of men from <unk>.
We've <unk> some <unk> <unk> in a more way we could decide which to choose for this <unk>.
He then <unk> it with <unk> <unk> all the <unk>.
And when we put it in the cell was <unk> and <unk> our <unk> <unk> the new <unk> went into the cell.
And <unk> <unk> that we didn't go beyond, but we tried to <unk> it more in there.
This is one of the biggest <unk> of evolution.
We found that <unk> species have <unk> a second or a third <unk> somewhere, <unk> in a second, <unk> in a <unk> <unk>, <unk> in a second, thousands of new <unk> to that species.
So who think about evolution as one <unk> at the time that <unk> didn't really understand the biology.
<unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> that was in the cell, they didn't <unk> one.
The <unk> <unk> we <unk> it.
It's <unk>, and it <unk> the other <unk> like <unk> material, <unk> it, and we <unk> with only the cell and the new <unk>.
it's become blue because of the genes we've <unk>.
And in a short <unk> of time, all the <unk> of a kind of <unk> you go <unk>, and it <unk> of all in a new species, <unk> on software new <unk> that we <unk> in the cell.
All the <unk> are <unk>, the <unk> are <unk>, and when you <unk> the <unk> code exactly what we've <unk>.
Now this may be <unk> <unk>, but we <unk> the software, we can change things that we can change things enough.
Now, I've already <unk> that there is not a <unk> <unk> -- but of progress from three million years and a half million years of evolution, and I've already said that maybe we're to create a new version of <unk> <unk> that we're going to <unk> new <unk> to this <unk> process.
Why do that?
I think it's pretty <unk> when we think of our <unk>.
We're going to go from six and a half billion people to <unk> billion in the next 40 years.
Right, to give an example: I was born in <unk>.
Now, there's three people on the planet to <unk> <unk> in <unk>; in 40 years, there's four years, there's four years, there's four.
We're <unk> problems now to find food, water and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> for six billion people.
I would have more <unk> to do it for nine billion.
<unk> more than five billion <unk>, over 30 billion <unk> <unk>.
That means 100 million <unk> a day.
When we try to find <unk> <unk>, or any kind of process to <unk>, it's going to be a huge challenge.
We have to realize that we have to <unk> of all the <unk> of CO2 from these materials that we <unk> in the atmosphere.
At the day, because of the <unk> <unk> <unk> around the world, we have a <unk> with about 20 million genes, and I like to think that are <unk> <unk> for the future.
The <unk> industry is just about a <unk> of <unk>, and think about how many different things are <unk> out.
Our <unk> here is <unk> data from the reality and our imagination.
Now we have <unk>, because of these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, able to create what we call <unk> <unk>.
We're able to build a big robot that can produce a million <unk> a day.
Think of these 20 million genes or <unk> of these 20 million genes or try to <unk> the <unk> to produce <unk> or <unk>, new <unk>, we can change, because of a small team, and create more <unk> biology now that in the last 20 years of science.
And it's just a <unk> <unk>.
We can choose to choose the <unk> of <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This is a <unk> of some software <unk> that we're working on to be able to <unk> and design species to computers.
Well, we don't know how they will they be.
We know exactly how their <unk> is their <unk>.
Now we're going to <unk> on the <unk> <unk>.
You saw some of you who <unk> from the <unk> was a bad experiment.
We've <unk> <unk> <unk> and third generation that we <unk> enough to <unk> <unk> as much as the <unk> or <unk> <unk>.
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the <unk> would be <unk> CO2 in matter before we're working on to design cells that can reach this purpose, and we think we can achieve this <unk>, and we think we can get the first <unk> <unk> of the next generation of <unk> in about 18 months.
<unk> light <unk> with CO2 is a <unk>, but in our <unk> <unk> in our <unk> around the world, we found different <unk>.
This is a <unk> that we've <unk> in <unk>.
<unk> in the deep ocean, about <unk> feet of the <unk> of water.
<unk> <unk> by CO2 using hydrogen <unk> as a source of energy.
We're trying to figure out if we can <unk> CO2, which can be <unk> with <unk>, <unk> that CO2 in <unk>, to drive this process.
So, the short <unk> we think we might be able to <unk> what the basic question, "What is life". We, we have the <unk> goal of <unk> the whole <unk> industry.
<unk>. If you can't do it from TED, where can you?
It's a <unk> source of energy.
<unk>, we're working on the same <unk> to create <unk> <unk>.
You've seen this year with flu, we've always come back to a year and with a dollar less when it's about finding the right.
I think that you can create <unk> <unk> <unk>.
That's how the future could start to look <unk>, now, the tree of evolution, <unk> the evolution with bacteria, <unk>, <unk> cells.
We're so so <unk> people.
Our purpose is to make it in a way of living enough to try to <unk> it. Thank you very much.
First of all, I'm going to show you, the <unk> <unk>, some fundamental work of the new technology that we brought to the <unk> <unk> to a <unk> <unk>. This is <unk>.
It's an environment where you can <unk> is local level that you can <unk> with a huge amount of <unk> data.
So we're seeing <unk> <unk> <unk> with a kind of <unk> <unk> and <unk>, for a fast <unk>, <unk> the images like we want.
And it doesn't matter how big the amount of information that we see, how big these <unk> of data <unk> or images.
Most of them are <unk> photographs, but this is a <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of <unk>, and <unk> in the <unk> of 300 <unk>.
It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that <unk> <unk> of a system like this is the number of <unk> on your screen at any time. It's also a very <unk> architecture.
This is a whole book, <unk> of data, not of <unk>.
This is the <unk> <unk> <unk>. Every <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk>.
And to <unk> that it's just a <unk> and not <unk>, we can do something like this, to actually see that it's a real <unk> of the text, not a picture.
It may be a <unk> way of <unk> to read a book.
I won't tell you.
This is an <unk> <unk>. This is a more <unk> example. It's a number of <unk>.
Every picture is the beginning of a <unk>.
And it gives you a really pleasure and the beautiful experience of reading the real <unk> version of a <unk> or a <unk>, which is for nature of a <unk> <unk>.
We also did something with the <unk> of this <unk> <unk>.
We created a <unk> <unk> <unk> much <unk> than that you use in a normal <unk>, and we've <unk> you <unk>.
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk>, you can see here.
Or some <unk>, or even <unk> <unk>.
And this really <unk> some of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of space on the screen.
I thought this was going to be able to put <unk> and other <unk> like that, you can't be <unk>.
Of course, <unk> is one of the most <unk> <unk> for this kind of technology.
And on this one I don't want to lose time, if not say we have <unk> to give it also.
These are all the streets in the U.S. <unk> above an <unk> picture of NASA.
So now I'm going to do something else.
This is actually in the Web, I live on the Web; you can see it.
It's a project called <unk>, which <unk> two different technologies.
One is <unk> and the other is a very interesting research computer computer computer computer, which was <unk> by <unk> <unk>, a student of the <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. It's <unk> <unk>.
And it's alive on the Web, <unk> by <unk>.
You can <unk> when we do this kind of <unk>, where we can go from an image to the other and have this kind of experience <unk> <unk>.
But the <unk> <unk> of the images here has actually a meaning.
<unk> <unk> of the computer <unk> have <unk> these images together, so that we can see the <unk> places where the <unk> all <unk> <unk> <unk> have been <unk>. So here's what you see is a <unk> <unk> or <unk>, and these things have all been <unk>.
I don't know if I've time to show you some other environment.
There are some much more <unk>.
I want to go directly to one of the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> and this <unk> <unk> from a <unk> <unk> of <unk> that we've done for the first time, I'll show you what <unk> is really the key behind this technology, the <unk>. And it's not so <unk> <unk> to look at the <unk> that we put in the website.
We had to <unk> some <unk> and <unk> and so forth.
This is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> images from <unk>. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> images of <unk>, other <unk> and so on. And so, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> an image that has been discovery to this model.
So they're all <unk> images and they've been all <unk> <unk> in this way.
And it's possible to <unk> this <unk> way.
You know, I would never have thought I'd end up to work for <unk>.
It's very <unk> <unk> to <unk> this kind of <unk> here.
I think you can see that it's a lot of different kinds of <unk> <unk>: from those cell to the <unk> <unk>, a number of <unk>, <unk> together in this environment.
And if I can, I can try and look at those <unk>.
Many are <unk> <unk>, etc.
<unk>, I'm <unk> a series of photographs -- <unk>.
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We can go from the <unk> to the physical <unk> of this environment.
The <unk> point is that we can do things with social environment. This is now <unk> data from the memory of how to <unk> the land, from the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> all that data together.
All those pictures become <unk> together, greater than the <unk> of the parts.
You have a model of the Earth that <unk>.
Think about this as the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> on Earth.
It's something that <unk> in <unk> complexity as people <unk>, and the <unk> for the people who <unk> <unk> it with the use.
They have <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk> by other people.
If somebody comes the idea of <unk> all these <unk> <unk>, the name, my picture of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> all of that data, and I can use it as a <unk> <unk> to <unk> in that space, using the <unk> of everyone else, and have a social experience <unk> and <unk>.
Of course, a <unk> of all of this is <unk> <unk> <unk> of every interesting part of the land, <unk> not only from <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I realized what? What do you do is that the software <unk> us to do is that at some point, in the next few years, all the photographs that's going to be <unk> together?
<unk>: Yeah. What's doing is basically <unk>.
It's creating <unk>, if you want, between images.
And it's doing it in the content of images.
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about <unk> information information that many of these <unk> images.
As you do a research research images on the Web, you <unk> a <unk> and the <unk> on the page has a lot of information about the images of the pictures.
Now, what happens if that picture <unk> all of your picture?
So the amount of <unk> <unk> and the amount of <unk> that <unk> is really enormous. It's a <unk> effect of the network.
CA: <unk>, it's really amazing. <unk>.
<unk>: I'm going to tell you a lot.
One of the major <unk> when it <unk> and one of the <unk> research is that we can live between who has no <unk> <unk>, including the past the wind, the wind <unk>, the <unk> in the <unk> of plants.
You might think that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, or <unk> <unk> <unk> are still <unk> <unk> <unk>, or <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, or <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the <unk>, and that the idea that the world that the idea that the world that we live in in which we don't think is a <unk> <unk>, but it's just a model of the <unk> of the world,
the <unk> of a particular <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> that our <unk> has done, good or bad, many <unk> ago.
And, of course, all <unk> of the <unk> <unk>.
Everybody <unk>. <unk>.
We're <unk> to <unk>.
We've got to <unk> the <unk> of death, so we can't <unk> and <unk> --
We all have art.
What <unk> is the <unk> of the song, the <unk> of the <unk> of every culture.
It doesn't matter that it's the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, or the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, or the <unk> of <unk> <unk>, or <unk> in the <unk>.
He was my <unk> journey in the <unk> a month ago, or a <unk> of <unk> in the <unk> of <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk> of the world.
All of these <unk> <unk> us that there are other ways of <unk> <unk>.
And, if you <unk> a minute, it's a concept that can give you hope.
<unk>, the <unk> of the world <unk> create a <unk> of life and <unk> that <unk> the planet and it's important for the <unk> of the planet as the <unk> <unk> as <unk>.
And you can think of this <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and you can <unk> the total of all <unk>, dreams, <unk>, <unk>, ideas, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> in being by the human imagination of <unk>.
<unk> is the <unk> of humanity.
It's the <unk> of what we are and what we can be as <unk> as <unk> species.
And <unk> the <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, for example, <unk> that 50 percent of all the species has been or is on the <unk> of <unk>, because it's <unk>, or <unk> <unk> -- in the <unk> of the <unk> diversity -- and you don't even <unk> to the <unk> <unk> -- that diversity.
The <unk> of all of this is, of course, the <unk> <unk>.
When you're <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on this planet.
It's a <unk> language, it's not just a <unk> or a series of rules of <unk>.
It's a language <unk> is the <unk> of the human spirit.
It's the middle that the <unk> of every culture comes in in the material world.
Every language is a forest of the mind, a <unk>, a <unk> of <unk>.
And of those <unk> <unk>, while we're sitting here in <unk>, at least half is no <unk> in the <unk> of children.
They're not <unk> to children, which means, unless you do something that is already death.
What is more <unk> than being <unk> by the <unk>, the last to talk to a language, the last to talk to a language, we don't <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> or <unk> the children?
This <unk> <unk> was the state of somebody in some part of the world every two weeks: every two weeks, every two weeks, <unk> <unk> <unk> of a <unk> language.
And I know that somebody of you <unk>, "It's not better?
The world would not be a better place if we all the same language? "<unk>, then we all talk about it. <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>.
<unk> of a <unk> thing means that we can't speak their language.
I'd like to give you a journey through the <unk> --
a small journey in the <unk> to give you a <unk> of what we're going to be <unk>.
And many of us <unk> that when I say, "I mean," I mean, "I mean," I mean, I really different ways of <unk>.
<unk> for example this <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk>, the <unk> of the <unk>, which <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
It's an <unk> that it's not able to <unk> the blue color from the green because the <unk> <unk> is <unk> in the <unk> of the forest, which <unk> the <unk>.
They have a <unk> language and a <unk> rule, <unk> <unk>, "<unk> <unk>," You have to <unk> a person talking about a different language.
But all of that has <unk> in the past <unk> is that in these families that they're talking about six or seven <unk> because of the <unk> <unk>.
It's <unk> and then I went to hear it.
I <unk> one of the most interesting <unk> I've lived in, the <unk> of <unk> <unk>, an incredible <unk> that had the first <unk> in <unk>.
In <unk>, five <unk>, they <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
They've done <unk> from the top photographs that <unk> them in <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> that this <unk> of the <unk> forest had never seen anything <unk>.
They <unk> the picture from the land, they <unk> them to research a form or a <unk> and, not <unk> anything, they <unk> <unk> <unk>, and they <unk> the five <unk> with the <unk>.
But <unk> don't just <unk> the <unk>.
They <unk> to each other.
<unk> percent of the <unk> was <unk> by themselves.
We were <unk> at eight <unk> and we found two <unk> of death, and when we <unk> to know, they <unk> that one of them was so that he died <unk>, and then they <unk> it. And then they <unk> it same. [<unk>].] And then, they <unk> it.
<unk> were able to recognize the animal <unk> from 40 <unk> and to <unk> species.
I was the <unk>, I was <unk> a very interesting task when my <unk> <unk> <unk> me if I wanted to go to <unk> me if I wanted to go to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And to give a sense of <unk>, I should have understand <unk> culture, and the <unk> is not <unk> <unk>.
It's pretty much about a <unk> view of the world.
Very interesting.
If you're going to <unk> the great <unk> of the world, what would you tell me?
<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, etc.
A continent has always left out, thinking that Africa has no <unk> <unk>. And instead, the <unk> is not <unk> <unk>. And instead, it's not the <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk>.
What makes interesting is <unk> <unk> is the <unk> relationship between life and death.
So <unk> do <unk> <unk>.
<unk> can be <unk> by the <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> <unk> to the <unk> <unk>.
So, the <unk> <unk> to say, "<unk> <unk> you go to <unk> to speak of God.
We <unk> in <unk> and <unk> God. "
And since you're <unk>, is the spirit that you're <unk>, as you can get you bad?
So it's <unk> to these incredible events: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a rather <unk> of the power of mind when it's <unk> in a state of <unk>.
I <unk> all the <unk> that I lived the most <unk> are the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>,
<unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that once <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk>.
In a <unk> continent of blood, this <unk> never been <unk> by <unk>.
In <unk>, I'm <unk> by a <unk>, but their <unk> is extraordinary <unk>.
<unk> <unk> are <unk> from <unk> to three or four years, and they live <unk> in a world <unk> and <unk> in <unk> <unk> to the base for 18 years.
Two <unk> of nine years <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>.
For this time, they come up with values of their society, values that <unk> their <unk> and only their <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or to say the <unk> <unk>.
At the end of this incredible <unk>, they come <unk> out and for the first time in their life, they see an <unk>. And in that moment of the first <unk>, when the sun <unk> <unk>, everything they have learned in <unk> theory, everything they have learned in <unk> theory, everything they have learned in <unk> theory. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> back and <unk>,
"<unk>? I said, I said,"
It's <unk>. Now it's going to be <unk>. "
They're <unk> and they say that we, <unk> <unk>, we are the <unk> of the world's <unk>.
This is extremely important.
When we think of <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, which is a <unk> concept in his <unk> or maybe <unk> and <unk> and say these <unk> are <unk> to the Earth.
<unk> <unk> <unk> are not <unk> or <unk> <unk> by <unk>.
There is no space for these things in the <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk>, but because of the time and <unk>, they created a <unk> of the Earth <unk> <unk> not on the concept of <unk> <unk> <unk>. But on a <unk> <unk>, the concept that the Earth can live only because it is <unk> by the human <unk>.
What does it mean?
I mean that a <unk> of the <unk> that the mountain is a <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> its <unk> is going to be <unk> <unk> and will be a very very different human being. And it's going to be <unk> <unk>.
<unk> it is the <unk> of a spirit or a <unk> <unk> is <unk>.
What's interesting is the <unk> that <unk> the relationship between the <unk> and the natural world.
I grew up in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that the <unk> <unk> to be <unk>.
That made me a human being different from my friends who believe that <unk> are the <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> that are living in the <unk> <unk>.
If we start to <unk> that these <unk> can actually create a different <unk>, we start to understand some <unk> <unk>.
I <unk> this picture at <unk> in the <unk> <unk>.
Maybe some of you have heard about <unk>, the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
What makes the <unk> is not the <unk> potential of <unk>, but its <unk>. It's <unk> by two elements.
On the one side, this <unk> <unk> <unk> a series of <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
<unk> the only <unk> has a <unk> <unk> that <unk> a little bit of the <unk>, but it's <unk> with the <unk> of a <unk> of the family of <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This <unk> has <unk> <unk>, very similar to the <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
If you ever see the <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk>, the <unk> that are <unk> <unk>.
<unk> that <unk> on the <unk> is a little bit of like being <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a <unk> of electricity. It doesn't create a <unk> of reality.
I often <unk> with my <unk>, Richard <unk> <unk>, the man who <unk> the <unk> was <unk>, with its discovery of <unk> in the <unk>.
And my <unk> is my <unk>, you can't <unk> these <unk> as a <unk>, because if you're done you can't tell anybody of being <unk>. <unk>, but they can't be <unk> because they're <unk> by a <unk> that's <unk>, <unk>.
It's possible to <unk> only <unk> if we <unk> with other <unk> <unk> that <unk> the <unk>.
Now, the <unk> is the <unk> that are in this <unk> are <unk> <unk>, the same kind of necessary to <unk> the <unk>. The question <unk> <unk>: in a <unk> of <unk> species of plants, how these <unk> <unk> <unk>, two <unk> <unk>, not like that, but if you <unk> this way, they create a <unk> version that is <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk>?
We use the great <unk> of <unk> and <unk>, which can <unk> <unk>.
But if you go to the <unk>, we'll be "The" <unk> talk. "
What does it mean?
This <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> in the forest, and our eyes <unk> in the forest itself.
If you <unk> how they <unk> their <unk> <unk> us, "<unk> <unk> <unk> of plants, the rest of you don't know everything?" I said, "No."
The solution is: you take the <unk> <unk> in a night night <unk> <unk> and <unk> with a different <unk>.
With this one doesn't <unk>, but it's much more interesting to <unk> the <unk>.
Now, the problem is that the <unk> is that the <unk> of us who have heart <unk> <unk> them, but somehow <unk> to the <unk> of history as our real world as well, and it's going to go through.
In fact, the <unk> century, <unk>, <unk>, not <unk> <unk> for its <unk> or its <unk> <unk>, but rather like the was that we've <unk> and <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> diversity and <unk> and <unk> the <unk> of the planet. Now the problem is not the change.
All the <unk> through the <unk> have been <unk> in a <unk> for new <unk> of life.
And the problem is not technology.
<unk> <unk> have not <unk> to be <unk> when they put <unk> <unk> and <unk> as much as the <unk> have not <unk> to be <unk> when they've put <unk> and <unk>.
It's not the change or technology that <unk> the <unk> of <unk>. It's the power.
The <unk> <unk> of <unk>.
And if you look at the world, I would say that these are not <unk> <unk> to <unk>.
They're <unk> creatures and <unk> <unk> <unk> out of the existence of <unk> forces that go beyond their <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> --
a <unk> <unk> <unk>, in <unk> <unk>, a <unk> who lived free free free in the forest to a generation of <unk>, and now <unk> to the <unk> and the <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk>, where you can see the <unk> <unk> <unk>,
<unk> <unk> <unk> with the <unk> <unk> to the forest.
Or, in the case of <unk>, they're disease that are <unk> with the discovery of <unk>.
If we <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk>, where I'm doing a lot of research, you'll see the <unk> of the political <unk>.
As the <unk>, the physical <unk> of a <unk>, is <unk> at the <unk> level, but the <unk>, the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> life of a <unk>, not just is <unk>, but <unk> <unk> in certain <unk>, because it's part of the development.
And you can't understand the <unk> of the <unk> until you get part of the beginning.
I got the <unk> miles from <unk> in the Western China through the <unk> <unk>, <unk> to <unk> with a young <unk>, but just to <unk>, I realized what's behind the <unk> I realized what was behind the <unk> to talk.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> million people <unk> from the <unk> <unk>.
The father of this guy was <unk> at <unk> <unk>.
That means that it's been <unk> to the Chinese times.
<unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk> during the <unk> that brought the <unk> in <unk>.
My mother was <unk> and his <unk> was being <unk>.
It was taken of <unk> in <unk> age of two years, <unk> under his <unk> because he couldn't have to live without him.
The <unk>, who did the same, was <unk> in <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>, for this <unk>, was <unk> to the work for seven years.
The pain of the <unk> can be <unk>, but the <unk> <unk> <unk> is from present.
And it was <unk> to a choice.
Do we live in the <unk> world, or we want to <unk> the <unk> world of diversity?
The great <unk> <unk> <unk>, before he died said that his biggest fear was that, in our <unk> to go to this <unk> view of the world, not just <unk> the whole <unk> of human imagination to a <unk> <unk> of thinking, but a day we <unk> us from a <unk> <unk> <unk> that there were other possibilities.
And it's <unk> to remember that our species is <unk> for <unk> years.
The <unk> <unk>, who gave us agriculture, which has <unk> us to agriculture, <unk> us to <unk> the <unk> with the <unk> of <unk>, creating the <unk> of <unk>, creating the <unk> of <unk>, creating the <unk> of <unk>, and we talk about <unk> years ago.
The <unk> world <unk> 300 years.
That <unk> story, I didn't tell me that we have the answers to all the challenges we can <unk> in the <unk> to come.
When these <unk> <unk> of the world is asked what it means to be human, <unk> with different <unk>.
And it's in these answers that we all <unk> the ability to be what we're: sort of <unk> species, that has to make all <unk> and all the <unk> can <unk>. And there's great moments of <unk>.
I <unk> this picture on the north of the island of <unk>, when I went to <unk> <unk> with <unk>, and this man, <unk> me the wonderful story of his <unk>.
The <unk> government has not always been <unk> with the <unk> <unk> and in the '<unk> to <unk> our <unk>, we <unk> them in <unk>.
The <unk> of this man is <unk> of <unk>.
The family, <unk> for his life, <unk> <unk> all the <unk>, and all of his <unk>.
You want to know that <unk> don't <unk> the cold, <unk>.
The <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> of this man didn't <unk> from the night or the <unk> that <unk>.
It's <unk> away, it <unk> the <unk> <unk> in your hand. When I did it, they <unk> it <unk>, they <unk> it <unk> it into it.
He <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk> of <unk> and when <unk> <unk>, <unk> a dog.
He <unk> the dog and created a <unk>, with the <unk> <unk> created a <unk>, has <unk> another dog and it's <unk> on the <unk>, <unk> <unk> in <unk>.
<unk> to talk about <unk>? [<unk>] And this, in different ways, [<unk>] is the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and all the <unk> of the world.
<unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> government <unk> to <unk> the total of <unk> area of a bigger <unk> area of <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's their new <unk>. It's called <unk>.
It's a <unk> <unk>. It <unk> all the resources.
So one <unk> example of how a <unk> can <unk> with his <unk>.
And, finally, I think it's pretty <unk> at least at least at the <unk> of us has been in these <unk> areas of the planet, <unk> that they're not <unk>.
For somebody is home.
<unk> <unk> of the human imagination that <unk> to the <unk> of the times. And for all of us, the dreams of these children, like the dreams of <unk>.
And finally, we <unk> <unk>, we're <unk> that <unk> never <unk> to anything.
<unk> that <unk> --
<unk> <unk> are not <unk>, but we believe that stories can change the world, and maybe we're the best <unk> to tell the stories of the world. Every month our website <unk> <unk> million <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> our <unk> <unk>.
Our <unk> are <unk> by millions of people.
Our work is <unk> in <unk> to bring our public to <unk> our public in places of <unk> <unk> from which <unk> <unk> from which <unk> <unk> from which <unk> how they saw and, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> to the <unk> world, and we have to find a <unk> world and we have to find a <unk> <unk> world.
where the <unk> of all <unk> can <unk> to our <unk> <unk>.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book I hope that you've heard and you've heard some <unk>, in case, I don't <unk> them.
I'd like to start with what I call "the <unk> <unk>."
What?
The <unk> <unk> of all <unk> society. The <unk> <unk> <unk>: "If we want to <unk> the <unk> of our citizens." The way to do it is <unk> the freedom <unk>. "
The reason is is, on the <unk>, in fact that the freedom is itself <unk>, is <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> for humans beings.
<unk> is the other is in fact that if we're <unk>, each of us can act to do everything that we <unk> our <unk>, without no one of us to do this.
The way to <unk> the freedom is to <unk> choice.
More choices people have, more <unk>, the more choices is their <unk>, the greater <unk> is their <unk>.
This, <unk>, it's so <unk> <unk> in society that nobody is <unk> to <unk> in <unk>.
And it's also <unk> <unk> in our lives.
I'm going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible.
This is my <unk>. It's not particularly big.
I <unk> a simple note on the <unk> to <unk>.
In my <unk>, there's <unk> <unk>, <unk> the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that you can buy for you a huge number of <unk> in the <unk> <unk> that nobody of the <unk> already <unk> <unk> <unk> that nobody of the <unk> <unk> is <unk>.
Here's what <unk> is.
Then you go to the <unk> <unk> for buy a <unk>: <unk>, <unk>, radio, <unk>, <unk>, radio, <unk>.
And in this <unk> <unk> store, there's a lot of <unk> <unk>.
We can do six million different <unk> <unk> using the <unk> that there are in a <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> that there is <unk> choice.
<unk> <unk>: the world of <unk>.
Once, when I was a child, you could get all the <unk> services, <unk> that were <unk> by <unk> <unk>.
<unk> the phone, you don't <unk> it.
A <unk> of that, in the other, was that the phone was never <unk>.
These times they went.
Now we have a <unk> <unk> <unk>, especially <unk> <unk>.
Here's the <unk> of the future.
My <unk> is in the middle, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> for the <unk> <unk>.
If you don't have it yet seen in the <unk> store, you're very <unk> <unk>.
And what is the end of the thing is that people <unk> and they do this question. And you know, you know, the answer is, "No."
It's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn't make things.
So in other <unk> of life that are much more important than <unk>, they <unk> the same <unk> of choices.
<unk> <unk>: it doesn't happen in the United States that you're going to <unk> and the <unk> you're going to do.
Instead, <unk> from the <unk>, and the <unk> says, "OK, we could do it." Or, "A," or <unk>, "A has these <unk> and these <unk>." "" "<unk>, these <unk> and these <unk>. What do you want to do?"
You asked him, "<unk>, what do you want to do?"
And the <unk> says, "<unk>," <unk>, "<unk>, and <unk> has these <unk> and these <unk>."
"What do you want to do?"
And you said, "<unk> if she was me, what would you say?"
And the <unk> said, "But I am not her."
The result we call it "<unk> <unk>," <unk> <unk> "," <unk> "<unk>". "
But in fact, it's not a <unk> the weight and the responsibility of making decisions from someone who knows something, <unk> the <unk>, to <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and so it's certainly <unk> -- and so it's certainly not in the <unk> to make decisions about the patient.
There's a huge <unk> of <unk> products, <unk> to people like me and you, if you think about it is not a sense, because we can't <unk>.
But if we can't <unk>, why would we do it?
The answer is they want we call the <unk> to <unk> <unk>.
<unk> of so fundamental as it is our <unk>, is a question of choice, how you see in this <unk>. "We don't want to <unk> kids. We don't want to <unk>." We don't have to <unk>.
And we can <unk> how many times we <unk>.
That means that every <unk>, you have to decide that kind of <unk>, you have to decide that kind of person.
<unk> to the family and <unk>, a time perspective of common, <unk> perspective, <unk> almost anyone who was that you <unk> the <unk> as possible, and they <unk> to <unk> the <unk> as possible.
The only real choice was when, not when, and not, and even what to do after.
<unk>, everything is really to play.
They were very smart students, and they <unk> their 20 percent <unk> of work on a time.
And it's not because they're <unk>, not because they're <unk>.
But why they're <unk>, <unk>, "<unk> <unk> or not?"
"<unk> <unk>. I have to think before? I have to think before the kids or the career?"
They're <unk> <unk>.
And they try to answer these questions, even though this <unk> doesn't <unk> the <unk> that <unk> and <unk> don't get a good <unk> to my <unk>.
And they have to really do that. They're important questions.
Now, the work: we're <unk>, as <unk> <unk>, because technology <unk> us to work every minute, every day, from every <unk> of the planet, <unk> that from the <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, there's a <unk>, and I'm not going to say that nobody is where the <unk> works.
I don't tell you, because I want to use it.
What does this mean, this incredible freedom of choice we have about the work? It's we need to decide, <unk> at every time, if we have to work or not.
We can go to see our son to play <unk>, with the phone in a <unk>, the <unk> in the other, and the <unk>, <unk>.
And even though I'm all <unk>, every minute we see our son, we're also <unk>, "I've got to ask this call?"
"I've got to answer this <unk>? I have to <unk> this letter?"
And even when the answer is, "not," that makes the experience of the <unk> of your son very different than what it would be in other conditions.
So, from any part of us, we look at all, small things, life is a question of choices.
Once the world was this: <unk>, there were some possibilities, but it was not a <unk> of choice.
The world of today I <unk> to this: <unk> is, "Is it a <unk> thing, or <unk>?"
The answer is <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> we know, we all know, so I'm going to talk about <unk>.
I would have this choice is two effects <unk> to people.
The first, <unk>, is that it <unk> instead of <unk>.
With a lot of <unk> between which, it becomes very difficult to do it.
I'll give you an <unk> example: a <unk> study on <unk> <unk> <unk>.
A <unk> has <unk> access to the <unk> data, the <unk> <unk> society, with about a million <unk> <unk> in <unk> companies.
What she discovered is that for every 10 <unk> that are <unk> in more, the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> two percent.
With 50 <unk> <unk>, there's 10 percent <unk> than when they are available to <unk>. Why?
Because with 50 <unk> <unk>, you know, it's hard to decide, and the choice is <unk> to the <unk>.
And <unk>, and still in <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and of course, <unk> <unk> never come.
<unk> that doesn't mean just that these <unk> <unk> <unk> food to <unk> because they don't have enough money, it also wants to say that the decision is so <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
They're not <unk>, they're <unk> to five <unk> per year from the <unk> of work, which would be <unk> to <unk>.
So <unk> is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And I think it's going to be like this.
"And," <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>, <unk> or <unk>?"
<unk> it just <unk> the decision, if it's for <unk>, right?
You don't want to choose the wrong, and you <unk> the wrong <unk>.
So this is the first effect. The second is that even though we can <unk> the <unk> and make a choice, at the end, we're less <unk> by the result of how we could have been with less <unk> between which you choose.
And this for several reasons.
One of them is that with many <unk> of which <unk>, if you <unk> one and it's not perfect, it's easy to imagine that we could make a different choice that would be better. And what's going on is that the <unk> <unk> <unk> us to <unk> the <unk> <unk>, and the <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> of the decision,
And when it was a <unk> decision.
<unk> choices there are, the more choices, it's easier to <unk> of any <unk> that is <unk> of choice.
<unk>, there's what <unk> call.
Dan <unk> has <unk> very well as the value that we give things from what we <unk>.
<unk>, when there's a lot of <unk>, it's easy to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and be <unk> <unk> of the <unk> that you have a choice.
Here's an example. I'm <unk> with all the people who are not in New York.
But it's what we probably do.
There's this <unk> to the <unk>.
A place of <unk>.
<unk> <unk>. <unk> day. It's all about it. It's all about them.
It doesn't <unk>. But what he thinks is, "Well, <unk>, it's <unk>."
"All my <unk> <unk> are <unk>."
"<unk> <unk> <unk> right in front of the house."
And it's two weeks I'm going to come from the idea that's going to be <unk> where it wants.
<unk> <unk> <unk> for what we have, even when the choice was <unk>.
And the <unk> is that we have from <unk>, the <unk> <unk> us against how <unk>.
Here's another example.
This <unk> tells us a lot of things.
It's about life the moment, and maybe it's not slowly.
But the most important is that anything you're <unk>, you're not going to do other.
The things that don't have many <unk> that can make less <unk> what we do.
<unk> <unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk>.
I tried it on my skin <unk> a new couple of <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk>.
Once the <unk> were just like, they were <unk>, and they were <unk>, only after <unk>, they were <unk>, only after they had to get a life and <unk> a lot of times, I started to go well.
So I went to <unk> a couple of <unk> when the <unk> were gone, and I said, "I need a couple of <unk>, this is my <unk>."
The <unk> said, "<unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>?"
Do them want to <unk> or <unk>? "
"Do them want to <unk>?"
"<unk> <unk> them wants or <unk>? <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>."
I was <unk>, and after a while I was able to say, "I want the guy to do it," I didn't think it was like, so for an hour, I would all <unk> <unk> <unk>, then <unk>, <unk>, and then <unk> the <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and then I had the <unk> store, <unk>, and I had ever had.
It was <unk>. With all that choice I had <unk> the best.
But I <unk> it.
Why? I wrote a whole book for <unk>.
The reason I was worse is that with all that choice my <unk> were <unk>, the <unk> <unk> to be <unk>.
At the beginning I had <unk> <unk>. I didn't <unk> me when I just had one guy, but when I had to 100 different, <unk>, at least one guy had to be perfect.
What I had <unk> was good, but not perfect.
I had <unk> that I <unk> with what I was <unk> in <unk> to <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> <unk> in life, people don't do the <unk> that these <unk> as they <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> themselves.
And this <unk> <unk> <unk>, even when the results are good.
<unk> <unk> in the world of <unk> <unk>.
Because if I do it, I don't know what I'm talking about.
The truth is more to do that.
"And he was better when he was worse," The reason why he was better when he was worse was <unk> when you were worse was possible to <unk> <unk>.
<unk>, in the world that we live in -- <unk>, <unk> citizens with the <unk> of the <unk> -- the <unk> that we can <unk> is that things are <unk> to the <unk>.
You never <unk> <unk> because your <unk>, my <unk>, my <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
The <unk> of happiness -- which you're here -- is, "<unk> <unk> <unk>," Yes, you want it. "
I mean, I'm a <unk> moment -- that I'm really <unk> and my wife is really <unk>.
I couldn't do better, I couldn't do that.
But <unk> is not always a <unk> thing.
<unk>, a <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> when there's just that kind of <unk> is that when you're <unk>, and you say, "Why?"
"Who is <unk>?" The answer is <unk>.
The world is <unk>. What could I do?
When you have hundreds of <unk>, and you get one <unk>, and you <unk> one <unk>, and you'll tell you who's the <unk>, it's clear that the <unk> you're.
I could do better.
With hundreds of <unk> <unk>, there are no <unk> for <unk>.
So when people make decisions, even though the result is <unk>, they <unk> <unk> and they <unk> their <unk> to them.
In the last few years, the <unk> is <unk> in the <unk> world.
I think that a <unk> <unk> -- not the only, but important -- of this <unk> of <unk> <unk> is that people have <unk> experiences because the <unk> are too <unk>.
And when they have to <unk> this situation they think that <unk> is them.
So the final result is that we're better, <unk>, but we're <unk>.
Let me tell you.
This is the <unk> <unk>, what we all take for for good and it's not true.
There's no <unk> that a little bit of choice is better than we're not going to be that much, but it doesn't <unk> that much choice is better than a little bit.
There's a <unk> value, <unk>. I don't know what it is.
But I'm pretty sure we've <unk> from a piece of the level where the choices are <unk> our lives.
Now, from a <unk> of <unk> -- I almost finished -- from the point of view, the <unk> is <unk>.
What allows all of this choice in <unk> society is the <unk> material.
There's many places in the world, and you know, you know, where the problem is not that they have <unk> choice.
The problem is that they have too <unk>.
So the <unk> I'm talking about is a <unk> <unk> of <unk>, <unk> <unk> society.
And what <unk> does and <unk> is this: <unk> <unk> <unk> you've talked yesterday about how much those <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> to be <unk>. It's a <unk> <unk> of money.
I mean that these choices, <unk> and <unk>, it's not that just <unk>.
They're <unk> <unk>.
They do it.
If a little bit of what we're in our society allows <unk> to be <unk> in those where people have too few possibilities, it would not be just their life to <unk>, but our <unk>.
This is what <unk> call.
A <unk> of income do well, not just in the poor -- because of this choice in <unk> that we <unk>.
So, I would say, "<unk>, you can become everything you want to --
<unk>, people of culture, <unk>, "What do that fish?"
"It's <unk> that you can't do anything in a glass <unk>."
"A <unk> imagination, a <unk> <unk> view of the world --"
and I <unk> it like this, in the beginning.
But then, <unk>, instead, I realized that that the <unk> knows the <unk> <unk>.
Because the reality of <unk> is that if you <unk> the <unk>, so that it's <unk>, it's all possible to be <unk>.
If you <unk> the <unk> so that it's all possible to <unk> the <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Everybody needs a <unk>.
