And last year, I showed these slide to show that the cylian artical tears for almost three million years has had had the size of 48 percent has had the 48 percent has had the size of 40 percent has had the 40 percent of the United States.
But this underestimate this subvality, because it doesn't show it of, because it doesn't show the ice of ice ice --
The art glacial art is, in a certain sense, the climate climate system.
And it expands of the summer.
The next slide is going to be a faster on the faster beings of the last 25 years.
The gacum lost are signed in red way.
As you expand you expand you expect the blue.
That's the ice in the winter winter, which is the summer of the summer.
You can see that the ice called the glacious glacious glacious glacious glacious glacious glacious glacious game, which is flight.
In 25 years is spent on this of this, at this time.
This is a problem because the interests is that interested in the artypical warming where there are huge amount of carbon that are enormous amount of carbon that shoots are transformed in metang from microbs.
And I respect to the totality of the atmospheric pollution, that amount could double, super-rate could double, super-return.
In some of the laka little deeper in Alaska metan is already boiling from water.
The professored professors of Alaska has been recated with a team is recked with a team in a team in the winter.
Video: Wow! At is good. Se's good. The question is if we well.
A reason is that this exchange that the termac exchange the Greenland of the north.
This is a glacial river.
The taken had never reached levels like this.
This is the Kangerlusaq, in the south-obast Greenland.
If you want to know how the level of the sea level of the sea level of the sea level of the sea.
These corrups are increasing rapidly.
Another part of the planet: Antarctics, the largest block of the planet.
And last month, the scientists have declared that the balance of ice is in negative -- and that Antarctics that Antarctics that the Western islands, is particularly rapid in the shop of the island.
And what's a six feet of water in Groenlevels of water as Groenland.
On Himalaya, the third block of ice block ice, you see new lakes, who were ice with a few years ago were ice.
40 percent of the world's population receivable from the population population of the population population of the population population that must be a matter of the world realm is going to get a matter of the world receivable to recogne.
One is the Ande: this ice is the source of the water potaking water this city.
The taken is increased.
But when he declines, the same acks at the same potable.
In California the snow. Nevada is diminiths of 40 percent.
Christs are in crisis.
The previsions, as you have read.
The growth of the world at a remarkable augment of incendeded.
The environmental disasters are increasing out of the normal and without precedented precedent.
Four times more number in the last 30 years of respect to the 75.
This is a sustainable gain of the unsustainable.
If you look at it in the history if you can see the consequences.
In the last five years we added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the oceans every day.
Look at the oriently the area of oriental Pacific Pacific of the continent, and both the continent of Indian Indian Indian Indian is that we have a poveriment of oxygen in the oceans.
The major of global warming, together to deforestation, which is 20 percent, is the use of fuel of fossil fuel fuels.
Oil is a problem, and the carbon is even worse.
The United States are one of the two countries -- together to China.
And it proposed to build a lot of other centers.
But we're assisting a changing change.
These are the projects in the last few years and some alternative motions of alternative alternative alternative alters.
All it is a political lotate in our country.
The carbon and oil industries have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote the carbon of clean that is a oxymor.
The image remind me reminded me to something,
Natmal Natma, in Tennessee, where I live it, there's been a 3.8 billion ger choories of carbon of carbon digs.
Maybe you saw it about news news to it.
This is the second largest flows in America.
It's happened around Natma.
The natalized public publishing was this one.
Video: She does the carbon the carbon is a type and happy happy.
It's abundant here in America, and it makes our economy.
Frosty the carbon is increasing cleaner.
It's precisely price, lovely and workers keep the stypendent stypendent stypendent stand.
Al Gore: For here is a lot of the West Virginia.
The largest society on the mountain is Massey Coal. This is the Massey administrator.
Video: Don Blankhenship: I'm clear to the clear -- Al Gore, Nancy Pelogic -- not know what they're talking about.
Al Gore: So the Proteam of Clima Clima has launched two countries.
This is one of it.
Video: At up to COALery see we see the climate changes as a threat to our business.
So our priority is to invest a great amount of money in a advertising efforts and confuses the truth of the versus of the carbon.
In fact, the carbon is not sport.
We think it's pulled -- it's also a good fum.
So not preocupatents of climate change.
Let me do to do with us.
Video: At you clean -- you can have heard a lot of it.
So let's take a game in a structure at the tough of the clean for the carbon dioxime.
Straordinary machines are a little noisy, but this is the sound of the clean technology of clean technology carbon carbon carb.
The carbon is between the main causes of the main warming, but the notice technology of charcoal clean that you see changes everything.
Do a look at the point of this is the clean technology of clean technology of clean technology.
Al Gore: And finally, the positive alternative to the economic security.
Video: Here is -- the America, the economy, economy, the economy, the economy, national security climate crisis.
The movie that the college all of the face of the fuel of fossil fuels -- like the carbon and oil is important.
Now, there's a new new audition for the circumstomer to use.
Like America, 100th percent of clean energy in 10 years.
A plan to work the work, making America to work and help us more securred to the global warming.
And basically a solution that you solve our problems.
Big America. You bump more.
Al Gore: This is the fall.
Video: Here is -- it's about to America.
One of the faster ways to bring the fuel of the combusted dependence on combusts that kills our planet.
All of the future is here. Venty, just a new energy network.
She shot 2: Noves investment for places of beyond beyond retributed.
Again: Right America. It's time to be realists.
Al Gore: A old African old manufacturing saying, "If you want to go to him.
If you want to go away -- you go together."
We have to go away quickly.
Thank you very much.
The last year, I was a introduction on LHC.
And I promise to go back to how the car.
So here I got it. And for those who the other time is there was no here, LHC is the largest scientific experiment -- 27 kilometers of circumstomer surrounds of circumstom.
His comfortable to reach the condition that were less than a billion second from the beginning of the universe -- to 600 million times a second.
And all of this is simply environment.
This is the Gineva.
We photographs these Big Bang Bang Bang inside the reevators.
This is what I work. It's called ATLAS -- is four feet and has a 22 feet and has a 22 feet of feet of foot 22 feet --
This is a spectacular image of ATLAS in building so you can see proportion proportions.
The 10 seeptember year, we have access the car for the first time.
And this picture was taken by ATLAS.
It was because of immenses in the control.
It's a picture of the first particles of particles that had done all the way of the LHC, entering into collision, deliberately, with a part of the LHC, and spread particles inside the reevator.
In other words, when we set that image the 10 sect-settember, we understand that machine worked, which is a great life.
I don't know if it was to exact us to do this when somebody went on to Google and saw that the page was this --
That means we had a cultural impact that we had a cultural impact of the scientific impact.
About a week later, there was a problem with the machine, had to this files here -- these dorates -- these dorates.
These files bring 13,000 amps when the machine works at the massive power of power.
Now, technical technical of you are going to look at files and say, "It's not true. I'm filterles."
And they can do it because when they're very cold, they become the cold cosids, they get cools superconvictions.
So, at less 271 degrees, at a inferior temperature of stars, these files can bring that corrupt that corrupted.
In one of the top of the most of the magnets in the LHC, there was a defectly defected.
So the files grow up and they save it in the middle of suddenly met to a electrical resistance.
This was the result.
Now, this is even more impressive if you think these magnets fish over 20 tons, and that have moved on about 30 centimeters.
They're done about 50 magnets.
We had to be taking it, what we did it.
We have reported them and add and addition of it.
Now, they're now now now now they're return.
And I walked the end of the LHC is going to be new integral in the ground.
We can do this and we expect it to get the data or slights, and continuing so our adventure or slightly on the window to discover which are the universe.
Now, of course, in a certain a certain fairly the debate debate about science and engineering and engineering frontiertiers. It's easy to confuture with.
I think the fact that it is so difficult to go beyond the limits, I think this is the value of things like LHC.
And I want to end with the words of a scientists Ingless, Humphrey Davy, where, what image, in defense is inuteful experiments of the inute, and the clean was Michael Faray, said, "No is so dangerous for progress of human mind as the science of the science of the science of the science of the science of the science is definitive in nature, and there are no new money in nature, and there are no new money in the world's mind, which is not a real-new world."
Thank you.
I want to start asking you to rethink of that, from a children, you playing with a children, playing cools.
While you understand how you reach them and reach them and resolve them and moves, and you learn in fact, to think and resolve problems and resolve relationships.
The space is deeply connected, the way we understand most of the world around us.
So, as an informing inspired by using physics of our interaction with physics, together to my consultent Pace, and the Jeevan Kalaniths, I started asking my: "And if we use a computer, instead of having the cursor whether we use the only cursor a gital information that moves on a top, we can have the only a physically digital information with both of the man,
and to it it our please?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer -- building the Siftable.
In words, a very large computer is a big interactive computer as a birth.
In words, a very large computer is a big interactive computer as a birth.
You can move them with the hand, they can see it in them, feel the motion and have a wireless. And they have a wireless.
But absolutely physical objects, as physics, as physical objects, you can just reach them.
The Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem of tools to manipulal information.
And as they get more physics, and as you can be more physics, and as we can explore the others, and as they get more physics, and as we can explore the motion, of the others, how we can move it, we can explore new and funny interactions of interaction.
I'm going to start with some simple example.
This Siftable is configed to show video -- if you including it in a direction, video turns out of the other side of the other side back.
These interactive riticians are aware of the others.
If I do that, you are interested in what they are going to be in it.
If they come surrounded and they can walk a little bit of it.
If they come surrounded and they can walk a little bit of it.
They also have their movement, and they incline.
And then we realized that one of the interesting interaction was to use gestures of the interaction was to using gestures -- a color as if it was a liquid.
In this case, we have three Siftable configurated as seckrow green six-trum chemices in the central central color.
and I can use them to go to the color in the central central central where they mix the mix of the color in the central central color.
If we can put it too much, we can put it up a little bit of it.
There's also beautiful possibilities of learning as languages, the mathematics and games of logical gical games where people can try and see the immediately.
I'm going to --
This is a Fibonaces that I do with a program of equation.
Here we have a words of words that is in half between Scarabeo and Boggle.
And basically at every turn Siftable, you get a letter on every Siftable, Pratically, to every turn Siftable, and you get a letter on every Siftable, and as you try to get words of a dictionary.
And then about 30 seconds a new set of reading and you have a new set of reading and new possibilities to try to do.
Thank you.
And this is a little bit of the children came to the Media Lab, I did that I tried them and I went up and turned a video.
They liked them very much.
And one of the interesting things about this kind of application is that you don't have to give people a lot of education.
You just have to say, "Compons of words, and they know exactly what to do.
Here's one other people who tried it.
This is our own best bete, there right there in the right.
It actually wanted to be actually wanted to be crawles.
And they just were getting bad, for him.
Now, this is a application of a interactive carton the interactive carton.
We wanted to build a tool, the learning of the Lui is Felix.
It can put new characters in the scene, relieving their associated with their associated associated with their associated associated with their associated associated with their associated associated with their associated associated with their associated associated with their own own own own sources of their associated with their own own own own own characters
It can put new characters in the scene, relieving their associated with their associated associated with their associated associated with their associated associated with their associated associated with their associated associated with their associated associated with their own own own own sources of their associated with their own own own own own characters
So that's doing the sun.
Video: The Sun is surgery.
David Merrill: World is on the scene.
Video: The treatment treat.
By work! Si!
So school and putting it can be the Siftable and it can interact the characters --
Video: Bau!
-- by inventing their story.
Video: Hello.
DM: It's a story with final open-open-open-a-a-a-in-by-wide.
DM: It's a story with final open-open-open-a-a-a-in-by-wide.
Video: Vole, I light.
DM: The last example I have time to show you is a tool, recently realized recently to sample, to sample, and to get music.
it's a tool, recently recently to sample and to be music.
The Siftable here are taking sound like based on sound and battery.
Every one of these has four different variations, and you can choose what it is.
You can get these sound these sound sound to a sequence to your please.
And it modificate it simply making a sound of sound and a sequence."
These are actually that you can control from living on the way of true and the filter.
Lawkacks to a particular sky-flight to get it to add it.
And then there are the general effects as time and volumes, which is applicate in sequence.
Let's look at how it works.
Video: DM: We're going to start a basis in two Sift," we are the sequence, we get the extends, we put it in a series, and we add other base.
And I'm put a lower of the bottom.
Video: DM: World-to-clear of the --
Video: DM: And I'm going to put the bacteria, so I can control the effect of living the effect of living.
Video: I can fast the whole sequence inclining the entire sequencing time from one side or on the other.
Video: DM: And I'm going to add the based to the based to the based to give more expression.
Video: I can do I can get the sequence sequence of the sequence of the facts.
So I didn't have to make it before, but I can sudden, making it more longer or more cortasks.
And now, finally, I can move the entire sequence inclining the entire sequence inclining "volume."
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is building new interfaces of man, machine is more and more more more like our brain and body.
And today, I had time to show you one of the results of this pattern and also some possibilities that we try to bring out of the lab to the lab of the lab.
The concept I want to transmitting is that is coming this new generation of objects to interact with the media digital media that will bring information in our world in the way we want.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the time to talk to you about all of you.
I'm a writer of it.
And I do write books is my profession, but it's more than that, of course, of course,
It's also the love and the basis of my life.
And I don't expect that it can change it.
But I said, something particular happened to my life and career in my life and career career, which let me to realibrate the entire rely reported with this work.
The particularly thing is that I recently written this book, this biographic book, a different thing called "Mangia, Prega, and what my books, for some reason for some reason for the world and became a big -- and it became a big thing, interactional sensational.
And the result is that everywhere now, people are as if I was convictly convictly.
It's true -- condamaged, condamaga!
They come from me now and they are worried and they say, "You can't afraid you can't do anymore?
You don't afraid to write to write all life without power to be able to create a book that can make somebody who can do you can do that?"
that can be able to somebody who can you this?"
It's very high insure that you know.
But it could go worse -- I remember over 20 years ago, when I started to say to people -- I started to say to people -- I was an adolescent -- I wanted to be a trick of the trick -- I wanted to be a trick of the trick --
I walked up against the same based on the fear.
And people said, "Don't get me to successful to success?
Don't you fear that humiliation of the reject killing you?
You can't afraid to do this mester all of life without anything else is going to die on a cumulation of dreams or frankly in a dreams of locare of flaps?"
So you know, you know.
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is, "Y."
I fear of all those things.
I always had done paper --
And I also fear of many other things that people can't have to be to be to be to ine.
As a algaa and other sprawling things --
But as I can write this is writing what I thought and wonderful is why is?
Is it it work?
And it's logical that anybody needs to be expect to be scared by a job that you feel that you feel like to do.
But what is this particular is that particularly nervous creative to make a health mental health workers in a way that other carrier and other career doesn't me?
How do I remember for example, he was a chemistry and not rememistry in his 40 years of activity where the asked if it had to be asked if it had been to be to be engineer if it had to be engineer to be engineer if you were to be engineer to be engineer?
There was never -- that block of John, like that?
It didn't work, it does it worke, you know?
Onestly, the engineers as group don't have certainly in centuries, they don't have certainly in centuries to be alcohands.
We have enough this reputation, and not only is writers but creative about all kinds of generation, we have this reputation of being enormously instable to instable.
And it's not really, to look at the contains of the magnant deaths of magnificent creative magnitude in the 21st century, they die and often for them.
And even the ones who are not suicidata seems to be really disrupted, by their women.
Norman Mailer, before I did, in the last interview said, "Oh, my book has killed me a little more.
But we don't beat the time when we heard this because we have heard these things so we heard these things that we have been interior that creativity and accepted the notion that creativity and the suffering of the realities and that art and the artly, it will always conduct the angood.
And the question I want to ask all of this is you agree?
It goes you well this thing -- because it looks like a centimeter of me distance to me not good for anything this supposed supposed to do this suppose.
I think it's hoyst.
And I think it's also dangerous and I don't want to see it in the next century.
I think it's better to encourage our big minds creative to live.
And of course, I know that in my case -- in my case -- would be very dangerous to start out to that feeling toward that I supposed, brothered the circumstances in my career.
which is a very young -- it's pretty young -- I have about 40 years.
I still have about four work in me.
And it's likely likely to be write of what's going to be right from the world as the work that was used by the world as the work that after the work that was used to be right now.
I'm going to be sky, because we're all about the or less friends here -- is likely that my largest success is to my short-shot-shapes of my backs.
Oh, Gesus, who think!
You know this is the kind of thinking that brings a person to start drink nine in the nine of the nine of the nine and I don't want to do it.
I would continue to do this work that I love with this work that we do.
So, the question becomes like, why?
And so I set me -- after a lot of reflections, which the way to do to go to write is to create a psychologic psychological cool, right?
I have to find a security of me, which is a security of me, which I'm written I am written to be that written to be able to get E, as I was trying to get out of how to do it through time, trying to find out other societies to see if they could have the best ideas and seeing other societies to see if they could have the best ideas and healthier healthy and healthize the best ideas and healthy as and healthy as I started to look at the time to do it in the way to see if they could be
how to help creative people to manage creative people to managing emotional inerents of creativity.
And that research has taken me to the ancient Greea and old Rome.
Seguitems because it turns out and then back.
In the ancial Grecia and old Rome -- people didn't seem to believe that creativity came from man, OK?
And it was thinking that creativity was this is a deal with the wine of men and unknown as a few surface, under some surface, unknown, for distant distant reasons and unknown.
The Greeks called these demons are looking diving creativity of creativity "demons."
Socrate, wonderful of course, he believed to have a demon that elarged wisdom by long.
Romans were of the same idea, but they were called the kind of spirit without the body a genius.
which is big -- because the Romans didn't think that a genius was somebody in a particularly intelligent to be somebody thinking.
They believed that a genius was this kind of extent entities that you have to live in the walls of the study of a study of the study of a study of the arty-cost of him and modeling of the art and modeling of the arming of that work.
Excectional -- that's the distance of which I talk about -- that this psychological psychological psychological that protects you from your work.
And everybody knew that was so that it worked, right?
So the antic artists were protected, as for example, how to narcism, no?
If your work was exceptional work was exceptional to be able to get all the market, everybody knew that I was helped by this incorporate incouple of the genius.
If your work failed it was not all of your failure, right?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be a inability.
And so people have conceived the creativity in the Occident for a long time.
And then the Rinaascise came and all changed in this big idea; we put the human being on the center of the universe and the more and left and no longer and left as the more and leaving and left as the finger of the creatures that detailed by the divinity.
This was the principle of human exact of the rational humanity and people started to think that creativity from the issue of the issue of the issue of human exactly iver.
And for the first time in history, it started to referred this or that artist as a genius like a genius to a person with genius.
And I have to tell you, I think it was a big error.
I think that allows somebody to create being as a recipy of being as a recipy of the source and the sistance of all my beings, creatives and inknowledge and the heres of all the way to be a film too big to be a film too big manufacturing out to human psychosic for human psychosic recial psychosic of human psychosic responsibility to be a film of a phone in the fragile
It's like to ask somebody to bring the sun.
And it is completely and the totally ego and creates all these ingestible ingestive on the performance.
And I think it was this pressure to destroyed artists in the past 500 years.
And if this is true, and I think that is, and I think that is, and now?
Can we do it different?
You may go back to a more ancient understanding of the relationship between human relationship of the relationship of human relationship of the relationship between human understanding of the relationship between human relationship of the relationship between human and mystery and mystery of the relationship between human and mystery and mystery of the reporting of human relationship between humans and mystery
Or maybe no.
Maybe we can't cell 500 years of rational thinking in a 18 minutes.
And probably there is people in the public that had to be legitimate suspects on the notion of the notion of the notion of the needs that follow people to follow their projects.
I'm probably not going to convince you all about this thing.
But the question I want to ask is -- why is it?
Why don't you think it in this way?
Because it has more sense of every other thing that has ever heard to explain the exxperant process of creative process.
One process, as anyone who has ever tried to do something -- so basically -- yet, you don't behavior rationally.
And in fact, it can sometimes a completely paranormal paranormal paranorm.
I did this meet recently with the extraordinary poeter Ruth Stone, which has now 90 years, but it was a poeter for all life and said that during her childhood, and he said that during the Virginia, working out in the rural Virginia, and I felt it in the rural same, and I felt it in the wind of the countrysize of the countryside of the countrysize --
He said it was like a fragorous level.
And that was rolling toward her landscape.
It was to get that, because he was to make the ground underneath the ground underneath its feet.
He knew he knew of to do that point and it was to do that point and it was to run as a morning to be a morning of a morn."
And so it goes to the home and it was followed by this poetry of this poetry, and it wouldn't have to make a piece of paper and and a pretty quickly enough in the past, and it would take it on the page.
Sometimes couldn't be quickly fast, so corrective and corrective and the poetry of the rolling and poetry the rolled rolled through and she would continue to roll and she would continue to roll through the landscape, and he would go through the landscape, "another poet."
And then there were those times -- this piece of piece of the time -- there were the time that the time was almost losting in the time that the nearly lost, right?
So, he was running at home and was looking for the card and the poetry went through and swalked a math in the wrong and then said, that it was like if you were to handle and then he was on the other hands and the across the other hands hand.
And he was offed the poetry from the tail and reputting it in her body and transcried the page.
And in these cases, the poetry would be presented on perfect and intact to the last word on the last word to the first major before.
So when you feel that -- it's exactly the same crazy of my creative process to my creative process of creative process.
Not all my creative process -- I'm not a convictly.
I'm a mule, and my way to work is to be awake up; I wake up to the same horariarian every day and go on and go on and go on and go on and go on and go on top of it.
But even in my head, I slipped against that thing, I slipped against that thing,
And I imagine that many of you have done it.
You know, even though the job and ideas I came up with a certain a certain target.
And what is this thing?
And how can we do relate to it it unlike to not do the head, but rather, rather than handses?
And as I do that, the best example of contemporary I have is the musician I have the musician I interviewed musician -- which I interviewed different years ago for a day.
We were talking about that, and you know, Tom, Tom, for the majority of life has been the incarnation of contemporary ary, trying to control these species of creative creative impulses these species of creative creative impulses.
But then he was smoot, and one day as he was driving on a highway to the highway to the Los Angeles, changed all of him.
He was going to fast, and all of a tract this little fragment of melodia, which comes in his head as inspiration, elusive and elusive and elusive and and the wants -- you know, it's won't how to get it.
He has no piece of paper is not a mathem, it has no mathem, it has no recorator.
So it starts to feel this kind of old old old old old old old that I said, "I'm going to lose and hossessioned by this song.
I'm not enough I can't do it it at it -- I can't do it it."
And instead of going to go to the panic same.
And he did the whole process and he did something completely new thing.
Look at the sky and said, "Scusa, you can't see that I'm driving I'm driving I'm driving it?"
"You seems that can write a song nowritt?
If you really want to exist, you get back to a more opportunity when I can take care of you.
Altriments, you go to care to get somebody else today.
You go to disturbing Leonard Cohen."
And his process changed after this.
Not the work, the work was still dark as you ever ever ever before.
But the process, and the fish anks that was released when the genius was released when the genius would be that out of him and remaining it was realizing it was realizing it was realizing that he didn't have to be an interior and return.
but well, this peculiar bizarre collaboration a conversation between Tom and this strange thing that but it wasn't Tom.
So I felt that story began to change a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a time.
This idea, I was writing when I was writing "Mangia, Prega, and fall of those cave of the disperation where we are working on something and we do on something and we can't be that that that that is going to be a disaster that that that is going to be a worst books that will be a worst written writte.
Not only bad the worst written --
And I started to think about design this project.
But then I remember it was talking to the air and tried to it.
So I went up on on the walking on the window and I would say my comments to a nice according to a stick of the room.
And I said high you, "You ent, both both it, both both it doesn't be brilliant not be brilliant not be brilliant not be brilliant not be brilliant -- right?
Because you see I'm put in me with all I haven't got more about this.
So if you want it to be better and you have to get you and make your parts.
Okay. But if you don't do that, you know, it's quickly not cold anything.
I'm going to write the same because it's my work.
And I want to do this for favor that I today I presented to me to do my own own own own own shape -- the end is that, OK, it's like this, secoule in the deserts of the North of the North and the music, dances and music, dances and music, and the sacred of the music, and hours and hours to the alba.
And they were always magnants, because the dancers were professional and they were fantastic and they were fantastic and they were fantastic and they were fantastic.
But every one of that, rary, something happened, and one of these artists became in actually trans-trans-trans-turn.
And I know what I know about that, because I know you know, because I know you all of you here in a certain point, a performance of it.
It was as if the time stopped and dancers walking through a kind of walking through a kind of walking a kind of line from the solite, as 1,000 of the 1,000 night -- but all of allineated -- but all of allineated -- but all of allineum was allowing through a kind of walking a kind of portal and it was not doing anything in different than the sunk of the him, but everything else that was alleny.
And suddenly in the same as a human being.
But you go from the below in and underneath and underneath the flight of divinity.
And when this was happened, to the time, the people who knew what was, they were called her name.
They were junged to sing, "All Allah, God, God, God, God, God, God."
That's God, you know.
And the note of the story -- when the Moriorian s' south of Spaper south of Spaper changed in the centuries of the centuries changed in the centuries of "Allah, that you can still feel in the crows or the floor of the floor.
In Spaper when a artist has done something impossible and magic and magic "Aah, hole, hole, bad," incomprehensible -- a fold, an ununderstandable, folden God.
And it's great because we needed to do it.
But the problem comes up the day -- for the ballery is when you wake up and discovers and discovers that are the 11 of Martedday and the last last of the Martedday and last of God is not more.
It's just a mortal with a death, and maybe it won't be able to get more to the high height to that height to that height to the height of it.
And perhaps no one canor the name of God while it is it to do with the rest of her life?
It's hard to it.
This is one of the most dolorous reconciliations to do in a creative life.
But perhaps not to be so anguing if you can't believe that, if you can't believe it, it is in fact, that the most extraordinary extraordinary to yourself.
But believed that just that they are given you from a inimaginable, founds of this team that you have to go to somebody else when you finished it.
And you know, if we think of it changes.
And so I started to think about it, and it's surely as I thought about it for many months in the book of the book that I'm public to the book I'm going to public -- the dangerous, the dangerous opposition.
And what I have to continue when I feel electractical I feel that I feel like I feel that I have to have been going to continue to do when I feel like I feel like I have to continue to do when I feel like to go on to this is, not afraid to be able to go on on the electric I have to continue to do when I feel like to continue to do when I feel
Don't fly in your work.
He says to present you to get you for your parts, whatever it can be.
If your work is ball, dance, dance, dance.
If the divine, you know, I get a crazy to get some kind of wonderful things, for one moment through your effors, then "Ole!"
Altriments, you do the same tumor of your dance.
And "Ole!" to yourself.
I think it is I think it should be taught to teach it.
"Ole!" at yourself the same -- even for human love and textboard and test talks to you to do you continue to do you continuously.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
As I talked about some of these projects on human genome genome genome, on what can meaning and the discovery of genes.
Now we're starting a new pattern -- we started to begin to digitizing biology and now to start that code to digital code, we're entering a new phase of biology, designing and synthesizing lives.
We always tried to ask questions.
"What is the life?" is something that many biologists I think they tried to understand various levels.
We tried different approach to the minimum to the minimum of terms.
We're digitizing by almost 20 years hours.
When we sequenced the human genome was treating from the world analogic world of biology to the digital world.
Now we ask us, we can regenerate the life, or create new life from this universe to digital?
This is the map of a little organism, the Mycoplasma parath, which is the smallest species from genome genome of those that can autoreplicate in the lab of the tiny of the tiny of the tiny of the tiny map.
And we tried to reduce the genome to make a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of it.
We can eliminate a hundred genes of the around 500 of genes of the around 500 that are here.
But when we look at the methabolic map of metabolic and it's relatively than usually now.
And so this is simple.
But when we look at all genes that we can helimind, one at the time, is very unlikely that this can bring to a live.
So we decided that the only to progress to be synthesize this chromosomes so that we could modify to get the components to give some of these fundamental questions.
And so we started the window of "We can synthesize a chromoso?"
Can chemistry to produce these big molecules that we never did to create before?
And in fact, we can do we do a chromosound?
A chromosome, it's just a piece of chemical chemical material inert.
The speed speed with which we are able to deal with exponential exponential is growing up at exponential exponential we are able to degree exponential we are able to degitizing to the life is growing up to exponential exponential speed to the life is growing up to exponential exponential to the
Our ability to write the genetic code, progress being, but it's better progress, but it's better better.
And our more recently results the results are exponential curve.
We started over 15 years ago.
The process has required a lot of tracks, starting with a biothic review of the first experiments.
But we found that sympty-sympty-DNA is very difficult.
There are tens of thousands of machines in the world that produce small segments of DNA, of the longments of 30 to 50 to 50 to length, and it's a degenerative process is the long, more error error is us.
So we had to develop a new method, to assemble these fragments and correct the error go.
And this was our first attempt of Phi 174.
It's a little viruses that bacterial batteries.
We designed the erroom fragments, effectured the mistakers and get a molecule.
The interesting part is when we took this piece of inert chemical material and we put it in the bacteria started reading this genetic code and producing this genetic code and producing it in virtual particles in viral particles in virtually bacterial particles and virtually inert of virtually inert in the bacteria began to reading of this genetic
The virals are then released by cells, they are back out of cells, they went back and destroyed the E.
I talked about recently with recently members of the oil industry will tell them that they tried this model.
They have more than you do.
We believe this is a situation where software can actually build the same hardware in a biological system.
But we wanted to do the more in bigger things.
We wanted to build the entire chromosome.
It's over 58,000 letting genetic code.
So we thought of building it in the size of viruses of virus, so that we could change the cassets to understand what the components are components of a living cell.
The design is crucial, and if we start with digital information in a computer, these have to be very accurate to be very accurate to be very accurate it.
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 was a standard was a standard of mistake for every 10 thousand basis.
We found that that that original herros. If we had been used that original sequence we would never be able to do it work.
One part of the process is to designer segments that are over, to be rappongs with all the other segments of 50 letters to build under-smaller subunities to build underlying together.
We do these.
You probably read you read that we read the clue.
Think it this one is we have a based genetic code genetic code.
Three of those letters together and codify about 20 adminoacidis, and there's a specific order of reading for every adminoacid every adminoacid of reading alacid for every adminoacid of the table.
So we can use genetic code to write words, fraises and thinking.
What we did we did in the beginning was automobile do.
Some have been delused by the fact that it was not poetry.
We designed these segments to just just just to join them with the same way.
There are gencymes that repair them and put them and put them together.
And we started to assemble segments with five to segments from five to segments from a segments of 24 feet, the letting of 24 miles to the letter.
And every time we product these segments in factor so we can sequence them that we're trying to create a tremendous proceide of creating a extremely robusted proceived proceived in a minute.
We're trying to automatize the process.
So, this seems the tabellon a bag plays.
When we get these very long, it's going to be extremely line of 100 miles -- not going to grow it into E.
You get to the limited tools of the modern biology tools.
So we looked at other mechanisms.
We knew about another mechanism called "recombination of homology -- which in biology to repaid the DNA is to repair segments.
Here's an example.
This organism, called Deinococcus radiodurans, it can employ three million radiation.
You can see in the high of the high of the cromosomes of the cromosomes became destroyed.
In 12 -- 24 hours is reassembled exactly as it was before.
There is thousands of organisms that have been able to do it.
These organisms can be completely set up.
They can live under empty.
I'm absolutely certain that life exists in space, and you move to find new environments of water environments of water.
In fact, the NASA showed this happened -- this living lives.
This is a picture of the molecules that we built using these process, just using the lievils with the design appropriate segments of segments.
The lievised automatically lief cars.
This is not been taken with a high-electronic microscope of the electronic microscope of regular.
It's a molecule, it's a very big molecule, which we can see it with a law microscope.
These are photographs that cover a period of about six seconds.
This is the publishing that we did a little time ago.
It's over 580,000 letting genetic code.
It's the largest molecules than a structure that has ever created by man.
It's got a weight molecular on 300 million.
If we spend it with a 10 without spaces, there would be 142 pages only to get this genetic code.
Now, how do we do it work? How can we do that?
Obviously, you can extent a girls.
It's a little more complicated when you use bacteria.
It's also simpler when it's also a cell of the eucarios as our res: you can simply extract the nucleus and insert another one of the other one that is basically the process of clonation.
In the bacterium archaea is integrated in the cellphone, but we recently demonstrated that we are able to do a complete transplant that we can do a complete transplant of a cromosome.
We purificed a chromosomes from a sort of a microbial species
The two are different as men as men as well as well as well as men as well as well as men as men as men as men as men as well.
We add some genes in a way that we decide what choosing for this chromosoft for this chromosoft for this chromosoon.
And it slightly with the gas with the gas to kill all the proteins.
And when we put it in the cells in the cell was wondering our softwo-stysticatoes -- the new chromosomes has gone in the cell.
And we started thinking we couldn't go beyond that, but we tried to be pushed to be pushed to the longer in there.
This is one of the most exchanisms of evolution.
We found that a lot of species have added a second or a third or a third of some of the hands of a second thousands of new tracks at that species.
So who think of evolution as only as a gene of the gene is a gene of biology.
There's the gerisms called "restrial restriction of the DNA.
The chromosome that was in cell.
The cellphones the cromosomes we put it on it -- ha.
And it's expressed, and it has recognized the other chromosome as extract material, and we found with only the cells and the new cromosoon.
It's became blueprints we put in genes we put in.
And in a short of time, all the feature of a species are gone in a species are gone in a species -- and it turned out of the new species, which we put it in the cell.
All the protein have changed, the membranes are changed, and when we read the genetic code of equivalent equivalent of what we transfer with you.
Now, this might seem alchemiia altering genetic software to changing things in a pretty stake enough of the fun.
Now, I have already explained that you don't talk about genesis -- but of progress from three million years and a half evolution, and I said that maybe we're going to create a new version of the Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosion of this digital process of the digital process of this digital process of this digital process of the genesis that maybe we're not going to be in the charge of genesis that
Why do that?
I think it's enough of our needs when we think about our necessities.
We're going to go from six billion and a half billion people in the next 40 years.
Just to give you an example, I was born in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet, for each other existing in 1940 years, there are are going to be four.
We're going to be now in fact, water and clean water and clean and clean and gas, gases for six billion and a half billion people.
It's going to be more harder for nine billion --
We clizes over five billion carbon of olial barles.
That means a day. This means millions of bariles a day.
When we try to find biologists or any kind of process to replace them, it's going to be a huge challenge -- it's going to be a huge challenge of it.
In the more we have to get it to the CO2 emission of this materials that ended up in the atmosphere.
At the day of today, thank you to scientific discoveries all over the world, we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I like to think that are the designed for the future.
The electronic industry has only a dozen about the electronic things, and think about how many different things are coming out.
Our limites here are data principlely by biologic reality and our imagination.
Now we have techniques, thesization of techniques, in grade of synthesization, in creating what we call genomic genomic genomic genomic genomic genomic combinatories.
We can build a big robots that can produce a million chrobots a million chromosomes a day.
Think of this 20 million genes of different genes or to try to optimize the processes to get optimize or drugs, or drugs, we can change and make more biology biology biology now that in the last 20 years, and create biology biology biology science.
And it's just a standard selection of standard.
We can choose to survival chance of survive, chemistry or carbon of vaccines -- production of vaccines.
This is a few software programmed with some software working to be able to seat us and design species us to design species us to the computer.
Well, we don't know necessarily necessarily as they would.
We know exactly how their genetic code.
Now we're concentrate on the fuel of the fuel of fourth generation.
You see that you can go out of the wheeling of the wheat was a finish.
We have a floor of second and third generation that will come up enough for sugar zero in the highest carbon of higher value as the eight of the types of thanol.
But the only way biology can have a big impact without increasing major major the cost of food and limited availability would be transforming CO2 is that we are working to design cells that we are working to design cells that can reach this discouption, and we think we could think we could get the first carbon the food, and we think we could think we were about about 18 month.
The sunlight with CO2 is a methodom -- but in our discoveries all over the world, we found different methods.
This is a organism that we described in 1996.
It lives in the deep ocean deep about 2500 feet of the water temperature of the water boilith.
They put out of CO2 using molecular using molecular as a source of energy.
We're trying to understand if we can go to the CO2, which can easily be transported transported through your carbon -- to drive that CO2 in carbon of carbon to drive this process.
So we think that a short we can be able to increase what the basis of the basis of the basis of "What is life, truth -- we have the modest goal of oil industry.
And if you can't do it from TED, where can you do it from TED, where can you this?
It would become a major funded energy.
And also, we're working to use the same way to make the same instantaneously.
You saw this year with influence, we're always back, we're always back, and a dollar and a dollar in less when you treat the right way to find the right vaccine just.
I think that this is building vaccinable vaccinable in anciously.
And that's how the future could start to seem to change it, now, the evolution, the evolution, acceling with synthetic bacteria with synthetic bacteria and indeed, and indeed, and indeed, and indeed,
We are so much from the best people.
Our purpose is to do enough to try to do it. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
First of all I'm going to do you -- the most quickly possible, a fundamental work that we took to Microsoft in the followed to a year ago. This is Seadragon. This is Seadragon. This is Seadragon. This is Seadragon.
It's about a local environment that you can interact is in the local levels of visual data that remotions of visual data --
And we're seeing a lot of gabyte photos of photographs with a kind of zoom of a fast coast and continue, availing images as we want to do it.
And it doesn't matter how big information that we see, as big as we see -- how big information is that we see --
Most of them are the digital photographs, but this for example, it's a scansion from the Bilibrary of Congress, and he comes into the gamma of 300 megapixel.
It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that limits the prasts of a system like this is the number of place in any time. It's also a very flexible. It's also a very flexible. It's also a very flexible.
This is a book, example, of data not images.
This is the Sindedesolated Dickens. Every Casa capitol.
And to show you that it is just textboard and not images, we can do something of the general -- to make a real thing of the text representation of the text representation of the text representation of the textbox.
It could be a little bit of an artificial way to read a book.
You don't look at it.
This is a more realistic example of the Guardian example of The Guardian.
Every image is the beginning of a section.
And it really gives you the pleasure and the beauty of read the version of a magazine or a newspaper or a newspaper or a newspaper of a newspaper of a half of half a lot of meeting of a half a lot of half a taceful ver.
We also did something with the angle of this particular number of The Gardian.
We created a higher advertising higher -- much higher than what you use in a normal advertising -- and we put you in the normal content -- and we put extra.
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile, you can see here.
Or other models, or even the specific specific specific and technique.
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space.
We hope this means that to put pop-up and other porks, not to be necessarily to be necessary.
Of course, the maping is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology.
And I don't want to lose time, if not to say that we have contributes to give it in this field.
These are all the streets in the USA subtle reset up a geospaace of NASA.
So now we spend a little bit of it.
This is actually from living on the webset; you can go to it.
It's about a project called Photosynth, which combine two different technologies.
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual research of the very interesting research of Washington, with the aid of Washington, with the aid of Steve Seitz of Washington, with the U.S. and of Microsoft Research. An Research. The other collaboration
And it's from Seadragonished on the web, gested by Seadragon.
You can see it when we do this kind of screen -- where we can go from one image to the other one of the other and have this kind of experience to multiple resolution to multiple resolution to multiple it --
But the space of the pictures here has actually actually actually actually a meaning.
The computer algorithms of the computer have recorded these images together, so that they can run these things that you can get the real places that imagine -- all the neighborhoods on the Montags of the Grass -- have been taked. So here is a chanaish stabled space. And these things are all college college and these things are all college college and these things are all college college college in space.
I don't know if I have time to show you some other environment.
There are some more space than the space.
I want to go directly to one of the original data set of Noah-- and this comes from a previous extype of Photosynynthosynthosynthosynth. And that's really not really exhibition is really really the key to be really exhibitosy-the-vident environments that we put in the website. And that's not necessarily exciting the website of the website of the website of the websth.
We had to worry about legal aspects and so on.
This is a rebuilding in the Chatheral-taken images from Flickr. Basta digitate Notre digitate Notre Dame in Flickr. And you get images of the cleaning camp, and so on the represents of a picture of the arguments of a picture that is discovering a model.
So they're all picked up on Flickr and have been all colleged in spacecraft level.
And it's possible to navigate in this simple.
You know, I would never have thought of finish to work for Microsoft.
It's very free to get this kind of cluster this kind of colu.
I think you can see that it's a lot of different kinds of finger: from the types of those phones at the types of the SLR, a meaning number of significant environment.
And if you can do that, I try to try to look at the strange.
Many are blocked by faces, etc., etc.
And in the part here is a series of photographs -- etch of photographs -- etch of the photographs -- and that's a series of photographs of the photographs of the photographs of the photographs of the photographs of a photographs of a series of photographs --
This is a Notre poster Dame recortly.
We can go from the poster physics of this envision of this environment.
The essential point is that we can do with the social environment. This is now taking from all of the memory of the collective views of view -- and it college from viewing point of viewing of views -- and it college -- and it collects together.
All of those pictures become together, more of the parts.
You have a model of the land that is emerge.
Think of this as the motion of Stephen Lawler on the virtual Stephen Lawler on Earth
It's something that grows in complexity as as people using that people use, and the advantages for those who uses use.
Their picture of them are marcut by other people.
If somebody is the idea of contrash all these sanity-finger photographs of Notre Dame of suddenly Dame suddenly recognized all of those data, and I can use it as a nice of the ingress in that universe, in that space, in that universe, in that universe, in that universe, in that universe, using the photographs of whoever is that we have a social experience of these guys of the cross-usher kind of cross-s-ushing kind of a slandle experience of a s-ushand-ushandle experience of s-ushimimimimence of this dyp
And of course, a consequence of this is extremely elaborated virtual models of the Earth, colors not just as views and images and images and imagery and imagery and similar to the images and similar to the images and similar enough of collective virtual models and of course, it's a collective viewing satell.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I understood OK? What your software going to have to do is that at the point, in the next few years of all the photographs shared all the photographs are practically colleged together?
BA: Yeah. What is doing is basically discovered.
It's creating hyperlinks, if you want to be among images.
And it's doing it in the bottom of the content.
The thing becomes very interesting if you think of the wealth, you think of the information of the information of these images.
As when you do a research of images on the web, you gin and the websents of the web is about the pictures of the photos.
Now, what happens if that picture is college to all of your pictures?
So the amount of interconnections and the amount of wealthy wealthness that is really enormous -- it's a classical effect of the network.
CA: By is really incredible. Compliments.
BA: Thank you very much.
One of the main pleasures when you travel and the research of the research is the power of the ones who didn't forget in the wind, the true, the truth in the wind, it is in the wind, the top of the place -- the top of the plants of plants and we are making the plants of plants that is in the power of the plants of the plants that you don't forget to live in the wind, and the way of the plants of the plants to lies to lies of lies to live in the power plants of the power living in the pasts of the power living --
You know, Basti to think that Jaguararar, Jaguarar, or that the Way Law's mith is still colmys' significant to me or that in Himalaya, the buddholes are still following the breath, to remember, to remember, to remind the central anthropologic anthropologic ans. And the idea that the world we don't exists in the absolute, but it's just a model of reality,
the consequence of a particular choices that our stirps has done, good or mall, it's a lot of generations ago.
And of course, we all share essential traits essential tracts
We all born. We all procreate it.
We are subjects to the beginning of the beginning of the initiation.
We have to deal with the inexorse death, so we don't surprised us if we go out and whales --
all of we have an art.
What it is the particular is the tremendous rhythm of every cultural culture.
Not matter the World's forests of the Borneo, or the follows of Haiti, or the Warriors of Kaisut Kaisut in Kenya sectors in Kenya settling in the heart of Sahara.
He was my journey in the desert of travel in desert a month ago, or a yak in in the valley, on the Everest, the demosque.
All these populations teaches us that there are other ways to think, other ways to think, other ways of thinking, other ways of moving in the world.
And if you reflect a moment, it's a concept that can give you hope.
And so we can see, my mind cultures of the world create a spiritual and cultural life and cultural to the planet and is important for the benbe of the planet, so as a ragnail.
And you can think of this rather cultural rather than an ethnos: and you can define the total of all concepts, dreams, dreams, dreams, ideas and inspirations, intuitions -- intuitions -- intuitions that has been by the human imagination of the consciousness of consciousness.
The ethnos: The patrimonum of humanity.
It's the symbol of what we're and we can be in as an species of what we can be in as an inquisite inthitive species of what we are and what we can be in as an species of what we can be in the inquisist of what we are and we can be in as an inquisist inthitive species of what we are and what we are and of what we are and of what we are and what we are and what we can be in as in the inquist of what we are and what we can be in as a inquisisissues.
And because the biosphere was freely consumed as a consumed ethnos: and purposes is much more quickly.
No biologist, for example, it would say that 50 percent of all the species has been or on the hours of the extinction -- in the most of the hypocalitty -- in the most of biologic diversity -- and not near the most of the biologic diversity -- that is a cultural diversity.
The indication of all of this is, of course, the language.
When you were born there were 6,000 languages on this planet.
One language is not just by a vocabulary or from a series of rules of grammars.
One language, it's the crazy of human spirit spirit of the human spirit spirit of the human spirit spirit of the human spirit spirit spirit of human spirit spirit of the human spirit spirit of the human spirit spirit of the human spirit spirit of the human spirit spirit of the human spirit spirit of the human spirit spirit of the human spirit of the human spirit spiris.
It's the media with which animation of every culture comes into the material world.
Every linguish, a forest of mind, a thinking, a thinking, a thinking, a thinking, a healthual system.
And of the 6,000 languages, while we're here sitting here in Monterey, at least half the hours is not suspected in the ears of children.
They don't get more teacher children, which means that it means not that cambas, but they have died.
What is there is more than being flexiety to be flight to be the last to be talking to a language of transmitting the wisdom or to advanced the wisdom of children?
And this is doing this is the state of somewhere in the world every two weeks: every two weeks a fang dies and leads with it in the ultimate shadow of a anguage ancient language.
And I know somebody is going to tell "Isn't it better things?
The world would not be a better place if we all spoke all the same language?" Benish symo, then we talk yorba. We talk yorba. We talk yorba. We talk yorba. We talk about cantonese.
We talk kogs.
You will do a track of a tract thing that means not to speak your language.
And I would like to do a journey through the ethnoser --
a little journey in the ethnosing ethnose.
Many of us forget that when I say "different different different ways of exists of existers" I mean really different ways of existers.
We take for example, this big, Barasaan Amazon settlic, the people of the anaconda, which creates to the myth of the anaconds, which creates to the west of the best sandwomen's broken bread.
It's about a popular popular that is not able to distinguish the blueprints because the celests is identified in the forest, where the popular is identified in the forest, which is the popular popular popular color.
They have a language and a language and a matheme rule of language, "English exogamy, you have to get a different language.
And all of this has radices in the mythological mystands is that in these families are talking about six or seven languages because of the mystands of mystics because of the mystands of a language.
They listen to hear and then they start talking about.
And let's take one of the most interesting tribes I lived -- the Waorans of Ecuador Ecuador that had had had the first contact that had had the first contact in 1958.
In 1957 five missionaries have tried to a committed contact of a commit mission of them.
They did the photographs that they were retled to the photographs that were being done by the plug of the plual forest, had never seen anything about the plug of the plug forest.
And they gave the photographs from the ground, they turned it to a shape or a figura -- or a figura -- they flew up the beginning of the diavold, and they killed the five missions of the billboards.
But the Waorans didn't kill strangers.
They kill in a glor.
Five percent of the mortality was caused by their own stand.
We are risalities to eight generations and we found two of natural death cases of knowledge that one of them was insisted that one of them was aging that one of them was aging that has died by the way, and then killed it himself. And then they had a knowledge of the forest.
The hunters were able to recognize the animal 40 steps and recognize the species.
In the first '80s, I was asked a very interesting task when my professor of Harvard and I asked me if I wanted to go to Haiti to get to the Haititi to intrupholars to the basis of the power of Duvalier and TontMacoutes, and impossessed me of the sessed sessed sessed to make the vard of the sessor.
To give a sense to miracle miracle, I should understand the Vodoun culture Vodoun and that the Voodoo is not nice.
It's just about a complex metahysics of the world.
Very interesting.
If I ask you to tell me the big religions of the world, what would you would say, "What do you say?

And all the popules with which I lived the most extraordinary I lived the most extraordinary Kogi Santa Mara, in the Santa Mara, in the Colombia in sectentrional sector.
Forty skin the ancient tyranny that once they live on the floors of Colombia in the conquist, the popular plane was going to be on the massive plans that you were going to be on the floor.

When we think of the inition and the environment of the environment of the old history of the wild history of the noble -- which is a raither than simplicity or maybe we ask Thorew, and we say that these populations are closer to the Earth of us.

What is interesting is is the metaphor that defines the report between individual and natural world.

I was often with my professor, Richard Evan Shultes, the man who brought the psychedelic, with her psychedelic, with her fungs in the '30s in the '30s in the '30s in the '30s in the '30s in the '30s in the '30s.
Second my tanks can classified these triptamin-to-hallucinogens because if you can't tell anybody to be hallucine. The triptamines can be brought to anybody in the triament that is actually naturally in the indeed inner inses that is naturally in the intestine, which is actually in the intestine, called monoxious intestine, you can do not tell to tell you about the monox.

If you ask him how they stablish their tassonoms are going to tell us about the rest of plants, the rest of the rest doesn't know all of this?" I said, "No."
The solution is -- you take 17 variety in a different night of the basis of a different type with a different type.
And so you don't have Harvard, but it's much more interesting than to be in Harvard, but it's much more interesting than to count the stami.
Now, the problem is that also the problem is that also have to be that the people who are in the heart of the indigenes are purpopules of the margins of the margins of the real reality of the real real world.
In fact, the 20th century, between 300 years, it doesn't be remember for the wars or the innovations or innovations -- but rather like it was in which we were stopped and we have been in which we stopped and we have been actively accepted the destruction of the planet. Now the problem is not change.
All cultures through centuries have been involved in a dance for new possibilities.
And the problem is not technology.
Indians Sioux not stopped to be Sioux when they put out of part and freck and freck and freck and they have been in Americans have no people in Americans have been part of the Americans have no binched to be Americans when they put out of the Americans have no broken part of the Americans have not stopped to be Americans when they put out of Americans in the Sioux of Americans have not stoppined in the Americans have no broken in the mix and stake.
It's not the change or or the technology of the ethnos: it's the power. It's the power.

As you know the genocide -- extinction of a popular popul, is condamn to universal level, but the ethnocide of the style of the popul, not only is not condamed, but addition of the life of the strategy of developing environment.
And you can't understand the suffering of Tibet until you get from the beginning.
I have spent 6,000 miles from China Western China occidental Tibet through Tibet Tibet with a young young Tike, but only came to a young again Lhasa I understood what is behind the statistics we feel absolutely talking about,

The modern industrialized world has at 300 years.
And that shark story not suggests that we have the answers to all the challenges that we have to face in the millennia come.
When these myriad cultures of the world is asked what to be human -- they respond with 10,000 different voices of the world is to be human --
And it's in these answers that we all response to be what we are. And we are going to be what we are. It's a conscious species and all the gardens and all the gardens can track of optimism. And there are big moments of optimism.
I took this picture on the north-hune windland when I went out to hunt whales with Inuity, and this man man -- and this man man -- and this man told me the wonderful story of her grandfather.
The government canades was not always gentled with the Inuit and in the '50s to stabilide our own mother, we have rhinks.
The grandfather of this man was refused to go there.

Our work is travel to the ethnos: in the audience of wonders of wonders from which left is going to be cutting from the way they saw up, they will hope, hopefully -- how, the central world of anthropologists to reveal the world of life in a place in a place of life in a place of life in a plug world in a plug world in a place in a plug world in a plug world in a place of the multural place in a diversity world of the multice,

Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope I hope to be called other than you other than the collegments of the collegments in case not neighborhood.
I want to start with what I call "the official dog,
The official dog, official dog,
The official dog, the official societies of Western societies the Western official citizen." And if we want to massimize the well-being of our citizen."
The reason is that it is from one side, in the fact that freedom is in itself a valuable, essential for human beings.
On the other is that if we're free, each of us can act right now to do what massimizes our well-being, without any one that decide in namely, without any one that decide in namely, without any one of our own well.
The way to massimize freedom is to massive choice.
More choices people have the more people are liberty, and major is their freedom, is their well.
And this is a deeply radicated in society that nobody would dream of put it in the society that nobody would have to put it in the two-fashion.
And it's also deeply in our lives.
I'm going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible.
This is my supermarket. It's not particularly large.
I put it up in a simple named on the condition to half up.
In my supermarket are 175 constments, without contempt to 10 varieties of oil is beginning of oil acets that you can buy to be a number of balsm that you can do a huge number of conditional constants that no one of the slight?
That's what the supermarket.
And then you go to the electronic negotio to buy a stereo, casses, CD, radio, plast, printing charge --
And in this single negotio of electronic electronic components.
We can make six million different and a half million different combinations by using the components that there are in one negotid.
You have to admit that there's a lot of choice.
Other and the world of communications.
One time, when I was a child, you could get all the service of the phone to the phone to the cell phone to the path of mamma Bell.
And he didn't read it the phone -- not buying it is.
One consequence of that, in the other one was that the telephone doesn't break out.
These days are gone.
Now, we have a variety of phone almost illiterate phones, especially between cellphones.
Here's the future.
My favorite is the midle, the bag, the hidden of the hidden and the bath, and the basis.
If you don't have seen it in the negotiate below home, you're certain you have seen below you to pretty much to be pretty much in your home, you're going to be pretty much of the negotiat.
And what happens is that people go into the negozoes and does this question and ask this question. And you know what the answer is "No."
It's not possible to buy a cellphone that doesn't do too much of it.
So, in other aspects of life that are much more important than the water of the explosion of choices.
Assistance, not happens in the United States that you go from the doctor and the doctor you have to do.
And then you go to the doctor says you said, "Okay, we could do A, or B" "A, we could do A, or B" has these risk" goods" and these risky? What do you want to do you to do?"
You say, "Dr, what should I do?"
And the doctor says, "As this is these goods, and the Brits has these risk."
"What do you want to do you to that?"
And you rebat the beat, "Dr. if she was to me, what to do you do?"
And the doctor: "But I'm not here."
And we call it the malate," as we call it the malato," expression that it makes it a beautiful thing.
But in fact, it's not that one is that a weight and responsibility to make decisions from somebody who knows that, you know, doctor, to somebody else is not -- and so in the condition to somebody else is not -- and so in the ideal condition to make the patient.
There's a huge marketing of drugs -- I direct people like me and you, you know, if you think of it has no sense, done that you don't have any sense, data that we can't buy it.
But if we can't buy them, why do you publish?
The answer is that they want domor we call the doctor to change the recipe to change the recipe of it.
And so that basically is the instead of the inner is a choice, as you see in this view of the inner choice, we don't want to force children. We won't want to get more an inheritial sex to the right time.
And we can reinvention us how many times we can deal with it.
which means that every morning to the risk of it, you have to decide that kind of person wants to be a guy that kind of person wants.
And I respect to the family and matrimon, a common time perspective for anyone who was that you could married the most pretty much as possible, and you start the pretty much as you can get the most pretty much as possible.
The only choice was with choice was with choice was with then, not what to do later.
Ogo, everything is really to play.
I teach them very intelligent students and make 20 percent in less of work than a time.
And because they're not less brilliant, because they're not less diligent.
but why are they impensive in the wents I mean I mean I do this? I should do it now?
"I should get marries me more late? I have to think about before the children or career?"
They're interrogatives of logoriants.
And they try to answer these questions, even if this imply not to completely do not completely to get a vote to my exam.
And they have to do it. I'm important questions about it.
Now, the work: we're lucky, like Carl arl -- because technology allows us to work every day, from every day, from every day, from every day, from every day, from the Hotel Randolph.
Two parentess, there's a angle, and I'm not going to tell anybody where, where the WiFi works.
I don't say that, because I want to use it me.
What does that mean, this incredible freedom to choice that we have to do it? Is that we have to decide -- if we have to work or not.
We can go to the ball, with the ball, with the cell phone in a pockberg Blackberry in the other, and the news -- the knews on the knews --
And even though they're all swalks, every minute that we see our son son to break the title, we are also asking this call?"
"I have to get this email? I have to get this milth?"
And even when the answer is "us," all this makes the experience of your son, very different from what it was in other conditions.
So, from any part we look at that, little things and big materials and large materials and stiles, life is a question of choices and life, life is a question of choices.
Once the world was this: Oke, there were some possibilities, but it wasn't a question of choice.
The world today is just like this, the dilemma is, "Is" is a good thing -- or negative negative things?"
The answer is She has been there.
The positive side of them all of the negative we know about the negative --
All this choice has two negative effects of the people.
The first one, paradoxy-scales, is that produces instead of liberation.
And so many options of the options of which choice, it becomes very difficult to do it.
And I'm offer an example of meaning: a study of the voluntarian of voluntary retil planes of voluntarian example of the voluntarian example of mean to be mean absolutely mean to be a study of the voluntarial planes.
A colleagues had access to the Vansed, the gigants of the Vanking, with about a million clients of clients in 2,000 different companies.
What she found is that for every 10 solutions that are offered to the extra existing and the percentage of the 22 percent of the exists of 22 percent percent of the
With 50 source is there is 10 percent of less of under adesions of under the fact that only 5. Why?
Because with 50 source that choice, it's maledetail, it's malezed to decide and choice is sent to the inquestions.
And at the questions, and asking questions, questions, and of course questions, and of course it doesn't get there.
You know, you know that this doesn't mean that these workers will be that these workers will have enough food, because they don't have enough money -- it means that the decision is so ostic that decision is that they also lost the funding of the data of work.
Not participand, they're losing until 50,000 dollars per year from the worker of work, which would be dispointed to the top.
So the paralysis is a consequence of having too many choices.
And I think it makes the world like this.
And for the ethish of ethis: ketchup, or maione?"
You would just take the right decision, if it's for eth, you know?
You don't want to choose the wrong source, and neps the wrong condition of the wrong --
So this is the first effect. The second is that even if we can avoid the paralysis, and we are less in the end of the result of how we would be the result of how we would be states of the result of how we would be stated.
And this for different reasons.
One of these is that with a lot of condition of which is that you could have to do a different choice, it's easy to imagine that you could do a different choice that you could do a different choice that would be better -- and what happens is that the alternative imagined induces the choice, and the remains of choice, and the reflies the floored by decisions that you can do a recognize that it was a pressure of the record,
even when it was a great decision.
More choices us are easier to be pleasing any details that it's insodden insods.
And the economists are what economists are called cost-opportunities.
Dan Gilbert asked a lot of good stamack stamack of the things that we confronttive to the things we comparison.
In the remains that we have a lot of options is easy to represent the alternative of alternative alternative and be less sodden less of the option that has choice.
And this is an example. I spoke with all the ones that are not New York.
But that's what you probably think of it.
There's this couply to Hamptons.
A place of lux.
It is unextremely win-up. It's all for them. It's all for them.
Not nothing that he thinks is "Well, males," is Augst."
"Everybody all my neighbors are alive."
"I could talk to the same way in front of hous."
And it turns out to the idea that is losing -- every day is losing -- every day of the cheates where it wants to do.
The cost-opportunity diminies the sodden sodden sodden has been excellent.
And the more are the options we have to look at the most of the features are going to be back against how cost-opportunities.
Here's another example.
This visual tells us a lot of things.
And it talks about the time time and maybe live slowly.
But the most important point is that anything you choice, you choices you have to do no do others.
The things we don't choose, they have a lot of four active that we do.
Third point: : spiral growing spiral of the waits.
I tried on my skin my skin a couple of jeans.
I always have jeans.
Once the jeans were just one of the jeans were bought and clothed from the beest, they were comfortable to get them and a lot of a face and worked a lot of times, they start to go well.
So, I went to buy a new couple of when the old were going, and I said, "I need me a couple of jeans, this is my cute."
The committed I said, "Like you want to slim founding, ashit, relaxed please?"
With it with the cernik or the bottons or the bottontonies," or "acdy?
"Liken you want to rops?"
"On eight of the bath? Bla blay? Bla blay." He had to be --
And I was wind, and after a little I did I do do that, "I want the only guys -- which was the only typothis." He didn't do the only one idea what I tried to be so for a little time I tried to all the stands of jeans, and then I went out of the best jeans that I had had had been done.
And it was the male of the basis. And I got the best I got the best.
But I felt I worse it.
Why? I've written a book, to understand it.
The reason I was worse with the worst is that with all that choice were very high tys: the jeans had to be perfectly perfectly -- the jeans had to be perfectly on.
And I had expectations I didn't expect anything about exceptional when it exceptional of the exception, at least one guys it was perfect.
What I had water was good -- but not perfectly.
And after I talked to the choice with what I was trying to meet I was insumed in confront of the waste to the waste aspectation.
The add of options in life of people don't make the expectations that these have respect to excellence.
And this will produce less sodden satisfied are good good.
No one in the world of marketing it makes it content.
Because if you know that, you won't know what I'm talking about.
The truth is more like this.
"You were better when it was worsing when it was worse. The reason he was going to be best when you were worse is that when you were worse was still possible to meet of the surprising surprise.
Or now, in the world we live -- opulgs, industrialized citizens with the waste expectancy of perfection -- the massive we can hope is that things are at the height of way.
You never have to be surprised because your expectancy wait, my wait, and mystaying.
The secret of happiness -- is what you're here -- is "Baspectack."
I mean, little time autobiographic moment -- which are really married married and my wife is really amazing it.
I wouldn't do better, I didn't have any better meeting.
But you don't always have to be a bad thing.
And then finally, a consequence of the jeans comfortable when there's only that kind of jeans is that when you don't meet you've got no sodddden you've got to ask you "Why?"
"Who is responsible?" And the answer is clear it.
The world is responsible. What could I do about that?
When there are hundreds of jeans, and you buy a jeans, and you ask the responsible of the responsible is responsible as you are responsible as you are all you.
You could do it better do better.
With hundreds of varieties available, there are not for the insuccess.
So when people make decisions, even if the result is valike, you feel insods, and they have the satisfied and damage their own hand.
In the last few years the depression is exploded in the industrialized world.
I think a matter -- not the unique, but it's important -- not the unique, but of this depression is that people experiences deludings because the standards are too high.
And when they have to explain this situation think that colp, they think that colpe is them.
So the final result is that in general we are better, objectively, but we feel worse.
Let me remind you you it.
This is the official dog, what we all take for good and it's completely falso. It's not true. It's not true.
There's no doubt that a little bit of choices is better than having is not that have been actly better of a little choice is better than a little bit.
There's a critical value, magic value. I don't know what it is.
But I'm sure we have super-sure we went from a piece of the level where the best choices our life.
Now, from the political point of view -- I've almost finished -- from the substitute, the nocy is the following.
What it allows you to all this choice in the industrial society is the material realm material.
There are many places in the world, and you know about this and you know about this and the problem is not that have too much choice.
The problem is that they have too popular.
So the face I do this is a males' exclusive to Western, realities of Western societies.
And what it makes and arrabby-flight is this: Steve Levitt talked to you about yesterday, and comfortable seats are useful. It's a wastste of money bits.
I mean, that these choices, complicated and dispendings, it's not that they're simply inuseful for useful.
They're deleteries.
They make it worse.
If a little bit of what our society allows was to be reversed in those where people have too poors have too poors to improve but also now.
This is what economists are called a paretian paretian.
One reddies of the reddict is not just the poor -- not just the poor -- because of this choice that comes back to us.
And so it says, "Oh, you can become everything that you want,
And you know, culture, you know, what does that weight is what that weight you know?
"It's obvious that you can't do anything in a vetron glass of glass glass of glass --
"As an imagination, a juried vision --
and I check it so at the beginning.
But then, thinking about that, I realized that that fish the long of the long long as long as long as long as long as long as a long time.
Because the facts is that if you swing the mouses of the mouth of the facts that you can't get freedom. You can't get freedom. You get the paralysis.
If you rops the mouse of it so you can become possible sodden sodden sodden sodden it.
You can take the parals, and you reduce the well-being.
Everybody needs a sphere.
This is almost most most strected, perhaps even for fish, and of course for us.
But the absence of some symbolic symbolic symbolic inds, temption, for rockine.
Thank you very much.
