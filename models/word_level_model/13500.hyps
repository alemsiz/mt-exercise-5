<unk> year I showed these <unk> to <unk> that the <unk> <unk> <unk>, which for almost three million years, had the size of the United States, it's <unk> <unk>, it was 40 percent.
I <unk> this <unk> the <unk> of the problem because it's not <unk> the ice.
<unk> <unk> <unk> is, in a sense, the heart <unk> of the global system.
It's <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
The next <unk> is going to be a <unk> <unk> on the last 25 years.
<unk> <unk> are <unk> in red.
As you see, you see, the <unk> to the blue <unk>.
That's the ice in <unk>, which is <unk> <unk>.
You can see that the <unk> ice <unk>, of five years or more, is like the blood, which here <unk> from the body.
<unk> years, it's been so, in the way.
This is a problem because the <unk> is <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, are <unk>, <unk>, are <unk> <unk> from <unk>.
<unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk>, the amount of global <unk>, that amount of not <unk>.
In some <unk> <unk> <unk> is already <unk> by the water.
The <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> was <unk> with a <unk> team <unk> <unk> last <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>! <unk>: She's good. The question is if we <unk> it also.
A reason is that this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from the north.
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> had never <unk> <unk>.
This is the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
If you want to know how the <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk>, here is where we <unk> the sea.
These <unk> are <unk>.
<unk> on the other hand, <unk>, the biggest <unk> of the <unk> of the planet.
<unk> month, <unk> scientists who <unk> the <unk> of the ice is in <unk>, and that the <unk> <unk> <unk>, which <unk> on some <unk> <unk>, is particularly <unk> in the <unk>.
<unk> at <unk> feet of the <unk>, like <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, the third largest <unk> of ice, you see new <unk>, which a few years ago, they were <unk>.
<unk> percent of the world's population <unk> water from that <unk>.
<unk> <unk>: this <unk> is the source of the water's <unk> of this city.
<unk> is <unk>.
But when we <unk>, the same happens to the water.
<unk> <unk> on <unk> <unk> is <unk> 40 percent.
<unk> <unk> are in the crisis.
<unk>, like you read, they're <unk>.
<unk> <unk> in the world, a <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> are <unk> to a <unk> out of the normal and <unk>.
<unk> times over the last 30 years, <unk> <unk>.
This is a <unk> of the whole <unk>.
If you look at the <unk> <unk>, you can see the <unk>.
In the last five years, we've <unk> 70 million <unk> -- 25 million <unk> in the oceans every day.
Look at the area of the <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and on both <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, where there's a <unk> <unk> of oxygen in the oceans.
The <unk> of the global <unk>, together with <unk>, which is 20 percent, is the use of <unk> <unk>.
<unk> is a problem, and <unk> is even worse.
The United States is one of the two countries with <unk> emissions together.
And they <unk> to build a lot of other <unk>.
But we're <unk> to a <unk> of it.
These are the <unk> projects in the last last years, and some <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
<unk>, there's a <unk> politics in our country.
The <unk> of <unk> and oil <unk> have <unk> <unk> million dollars in the last year to <unk> <unk>, which is a <unk>.
<unk> image, I <unk> something --
<unk> <unk>, where I live, there was a <unk> <unk> billion <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
Maybe you've seen it on the <unk>.
This is the second largest flow of <unk> in America.
It's happened around <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> of one of the <unk> <unk> was this.
<unk>: <unk> â™« <unk> the <unk> is a <unk> guy.
It's <unk> here in America, and we grow our economy.
<unk> <unk> is more and more <unk>.
It's at good price, <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> is a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The largest <unk> society <unk> on the <unk> is <unk>. This is his <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> <unk>: <unk> <unk>, Al <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> -- not know what they're talking about.
<unk>: So the <unk> for the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This is one of them, a part.
<unk>: <unk>: <unk> <unk>, we see the changes <unk> as a <unk> <unk> to our business.
For this <unk> our <unk> is <unk> a big amount of money in a <unk> <unk> to make a public <unk> and <unk> the truth on <unk>.
<unk>, <unk> is not <unk>.
We think it's <unk> -- it also <unk>.
So we don't <unk> about climate change.
We want to do.
<unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk> -- you've heard a lot of it.
So I <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> for how much <unk> <unk>.
<unk>! <unk> are a little <unk>, but this is the sound of the technology of <unk>.
<unk> <unk> is between the main <unk> of the global <unk>, but the <unk> technology <unk> that you see everything.
Let's look at this: this is the <unk> <unk> technology.
<unk>: <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to the economic issue and the national security <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>: <unk> America is in the crisis; the <unk> <unk>, the national <unk> crisis.
The <unk> that <unk> all of our <unk> from <unk> <unk>, like <unk> <unk> and oil <unk>.
Now,, there's a new, <unk> solution to <unk>.
<unk> America: 100 percent of <unk> energy, in 10 years.
A plan to <unk> America to work, <unk> more <unk>, and to help <unk> global warming.
<unk>, a solution that we <unk> our problems.
<unk> America. <unk> more.
<unk>: This is the last one.
<unk>: It's about <unk> energy to America.
One of the most <unk> ways of <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> that <unk> our planet.
<unk>: The future is here. <unk>, <unk>, a new network.
<unk> <unk>: <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> America. It's time to be <unk>.
<unk>: A old <unk> <unk> says, "If you want to go to, go from alone.
If you want to go away, go together. "
We have to go far, quickly.
Thank you very much.
<unk> year at TED, I did an <unk> on <unk>.
And I try to <unk> about how the machine works.
So, I was. And for those who was not, the other time, the <unk> is the largest scientific experiment ever <unk> -- <unk>.
<unk> is to <unk> the conditions that were there there less than a <unk> <unk> by the beginning of the universe -- until <unk> million times a second.
All that's just <unk>.
This is the <unk> machine.
<unk> these <unk> <unk> inside.
This is what I work. It's called <unk> -- is <unk> <unk> <unk> and has a <unk> <unk> feet.
This is a <unk> image of <unk> in building so you can see the <unk>.
<unk> <unk> year, we <unk> the car for the first time.
And this picture was <unk> by <unk>.
It was because of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> room.
It's an image of the first <unk> of particles that he had made everything around the <unk>, <unk>, with a part of the <unk>, and <unk> particles inside the <unk>.
In other words, when you put that image 10 <unk>, <unk> that the machine, the camera that's a great <unk>.
I don't know if it was this to <unk> about more or this, when somebody <unk> on Google and <unk> that the page was this.
What we've had a <unk> impact over to the scientific <unk>.
<unk> a week later, there was a problem with the car, it had to these <unk> here -- these <unk> <unk> <unk>.
These <unk> <unk> <unk> when the car works at the <unk> of the <unk>.
Now, the <unk> between you of you <unk> <unk> and <unk>, "It's not true. I'm <unk> too <unk>."
And instead they can do it because when they're very <unk>, they're <unk> <unk>.
So, at least <unk> degrees, at a temperature <unk> at the stars, these <unk> can bring that <unk>.
In one of the <unk> <unk> in <unk>, there was a <unk> <unk>.
So the <unk> <unk> <unk>, and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a electric <unk>.
This was the result.
Now, this is even more <unk> if you think that these <unk> <unk> more than 20 <unk>, and that's <unk> about 30 <unk>.
You have about 50 <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, what we did.
We <unk> them and <unk>.
Now, they're <unk> to their place.
<unk> the end of <unk> the <unk> is going to be again.
We <unk> it, and we try to get <unk> data to <unk> or <unk>, and continue so our <unk> to find out what are the <unk> that are <unk> that are the universe.
Now, of course, in some way, these <unk> <unk> the <unk> on the value of science and <unk>. It's easy to <unk>.
I think the fact that's so hard, the fact that you can go beyond the <unk>, I think it's this value of things like <unk>.
I want to end with words of a <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, which, <unk> <unk>, who, in <unk> <unk> of <unk> experiments of his <unk> was Michael, he said, "No, it's not so <unk> to the <unk> of the human mind is <unk>, that there are not <unk>, that there are no <unk> in nature, and there's not <unk>, and that there are not <unk>, and we have <unk>."
Thank you.
I want to start <unk> to when, children, <unk> with <unk>.
<unk> <unk> like <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> to the way we <unk> a lot of the world around us.
So, from <unk> <unk> of our <unk> with <unk> objects, together with my <unk> <unk>, and my <unk> <unk> <unk>, and I started <unk>, "And if we we use a computer, instead of having the only <unk> as a computer, instead of having the <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>,
and we try to our <unk>?
The question was so interesting that I decided to explore the answer, building <unk>.
In a few words, a <unk> is a computer <unk> as a <unk>.
In a few words, a <unk> is a computer <unk> as a <unk>.
You can <unk> them with their hand, they can hear their <unk>, and they feel their movement and have a <unk> and a radio <unk>.
But <unk>, they're <unk> objects, like <unk>, you can just <unk>.
<unk> are the example of a new <unk> of tools to <unk> the digital information.
And as they become more <unk>, <unk> of the movement, the other, and they <unk> the <unk> of the <unk>, the <unk> of the other, of how we can <unk> new and <unk> <unk> of <unk>.
I'll start with some simple example.
This <unk> is <unk> to show you about the video: if you put it in a direction, the <unk> <unk> so, if you go back to the other side back.
These <unk> <unk> are <unk> of other.
If you <unk> them, it's <unk> to what's going around.
If they're <unk>, they can <unk> it and they can <unk> a little bit.
If they're <unk>, they can <unk> it and they can <unk> a little bit.
They also <unk> their movement and <unk>.
We realized that one of the interesting <unk> was that we could use common on on data, for example, "<unk>" <unk> "a color as if it was a <unk>.
In this case, we have three <unk> <unk> as a <unk> of <unk> and I can <unk> to <unk> the color in the <unk>, where you're <unk>.
and I can <unk> to <unk> color in the central <unk>, where you're <unk>.
If we <unk> too, we can <unk> a little bit of a little place.
I also have <unk> possibilities of <unk>, like <unk>, <unk> and games where people can try the <unk>, and <unk> the results where people can try things things, and <unk> the results immediately.
Now, I'm --
This is a <unk> <unk> that I do with a <unk> program.
Here we have a <unk> of words that's in the <unk> and <unk>.
<unk>, at every <unk> <unk> <unk> a letter on every <unk>, <unk>, at every <unk> <unk> <unk> a letter on every <unk>, and while I was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Then, about 30 seconds, you <unk>, and you have a new <unk> of <unk> and new possibilities to try.
Thank you.
Here's <unk> <unk> <unk>, I made a video.
They're very <unk>.
And one of the interesting things about this kind of <unk> is that you don't have to <unk> people.
I just say, "<unk> <unk> of words," and they know what they do.
Here's other people who <unk> it.
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk>, there's a young <unk>, there's right.
It just wanted to <unk>.
They were just <unk>, for him.
Now, this is a <unk> of a <unk> <unk>.
I was building a <unk> <unk> <unk>. He's <unk>.
It can <unk> new characters in the scene, <unk> their <unk>.
It can <unk> new characters in the scene, <unk> their <unk>.
So, it's doing the sun.
<unk>: The sun is <unk>.
David <unk>: Now he brought a <unk> in the scene.
<unk>: The <unk> <unk>.
<unk> work!
So, <unk> <unk> and <unk> can make the characters --
<unk>: <unk>!
<unk> your story.
<unk>: <unk>!
<unk>: It's a story with the final story, and he can decide how to <unk>.
<unk>: It's a story with the final story, and he can decide how to <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>, <unk>.
<unk>: The last example I have time I've got time to show you is a recent tool, and <unk> music.
It's a <unk>, and I <unk> and <unk> music.
<unk> here is <unk> <unk> as the bottom, <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> of these has four different <unk>, and you can choose what to use.
You can also <unk> these <unk> in a <unk> <unk>.
And I just <unk> by doing a <unk> sound and a <unk>. "
These are actually that you can control the alive, like <unk> and <unk>.
I <unk> it to a particular sound and then they <unk> to <unk>.
And then there's the effects of time, and <unk>, who's <unk> to the whole sequence.
<unk> how it works.
<unk>: <unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> in two <unk>, "the <unk> in a series, the <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
Now, let's look at a <unk>.
<unk>: Now, <unk> <unk>: I'm going to <unk> --
<unk>: So now I'm going to <unk> the <unk>, so I can control the effect from the alive.
<unk>: <unk>: I can <unk> the whole <unk> <unk> the time on one hand, or the other.
<unk>: So now we're going to <unk> the bottom to give more <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>: I can <unk> the <unk> <unk>.
So I don't have to <unk> before, but I can <unk>, <unk> more or more <unk>.
And now, finally, I can <unk> the whole <unk> <unk> on the left <unk> <unk>.
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is building new <unk> <unk> <unk> and more <unk> <unk> to how our brain work.
And today, I've had time to show you one of the results of this <unk>, and some possibilities that we try to bring out of the lab.
The concept I want to <unk> is that's <unk> this new generation of <unk> objects to <unk> with media, that we will <unk> information in our world in the way we want.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the <unk> of you.
I'm a <unk>.
<unk> books is my <unk>, but it's more about this, of course.
It's also love and <unk> of my life.
And I don't think about it.
But, I said, something particular is happened in my life and my career, who <unk> me to <unk> the whole relationship with this work.
The particular thing is I <unk> wrote this book, this <unk> called "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And the result is that everywhere we're going to be <unk>.
<unk> -- <unk>, <unk>!
I'm going to be <unk>, and they say, "You don't have fear not any more?
You don't have fear to write for all life without any longer being able to create a book that can <unk> to someone? "
that can <unk>? "
It's <unk>, you know.
But it could be worse, and I remember the <unk> of 20 years ago, when I started to say to people -- I was a <unk> -- I wanted to be a <unk>.
I <unk> the same <unk> <unk> by fear.
And people said, "Don't you know, I don't want to be successful?
You don't have fear that the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>?
You don't have fear to do this <unk> for all life without anything else is that it's going out and die on a <unk> of <unk> <unk>? "
So, you know.
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is, "Yes."
Yes, I'm afraid of all those things.
I always had fear.
And I also fear of many other things that people couldn't happen.
As <unk> and other things <unk>.
But, as I said, what I thought and I thought I was why?
Is it <unk>?
It's <unk> that anyone who <unk> to be <unk> by a job that you feel like to do.
But what's about this particular <unk> <unk> <unk> by <unk> <unk> about health <unk> <unk> in a way that other <unk> do not?
How did my father, for example, he was a <unk> <unk> and I don't remember one time in his 40 years of <unk> in which he was asked if he had fear to be <unk>?
It was never -- that <unk> of the <unk> of John, how it goes?
<unk>'t it, how do you?
<unk>, the <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> the <unk> of being <unk> <unk>.
We <unk>, we have enough this <unk>, and not only <unk>, but <unk> of all sorts of <unk>, we have this <unk> to be <unk> <unk>.
And they don't know, you know, you look at the <unk> <unk> <unk> that, only in the <unk> century, <unk> young and <unk> for them.
And even those who don't seem to be really <unk> by their <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, before he died, in the last <unk> said, "My book," <unk> my book, "a little more <unk> about the work of their life.
But we don't <unk> <unk> when we say, because we heard these things so long that we have completely <unk> and <unk> the <unk> that creativity and <unk> the <unk> that creativity and <unk> are in some ways, and the art, finally, <unk>, <unk> always <unk> to the <unk>.
And the question I want to <unk> all here today is: are you agree with this idea?
It's good about this thing -- because it's also <unk> by a <unk> distance to me, it's not good for this <unk>.
I think it's <unk>.
And I think it's also <unk> and I don't want to be <unk> in the next century.
I think it's better <unk> our big <unk> to live.
And I certainly know, in my case -- in my case -- it would be very <unk> to start <unk> to that <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in which I'm in my career.
<unk> -- <unk>, look at a young, I've got about 40 years.
I still have about four <unk> of work in me.
And it's very <unk> that anything that's going to be <unk> from the world like the work that I <unk> after <unk> <unk> of my last book.
<unk> <unk>, because we're all about <unk>, because we're all the time, is my greatest success is to my <unk>.
Oh, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
You know, this is the kind of thinking about a person's <unk> at nine in the morning, and I don't want to do it.
I love to keep doing this work that I love.
So, the question becomes, how?
And so it seems to me, after many <unk>, that the way to work to keep <unk> is to create a <unk> <unk>, OK?
I have to have a few ways to have a <unk> between me, which I'm <unk>, and my natural <unk> on what we did. And while I I was going to go for this year year, how to do we <unk> to look through the time, looking for finding out out of the best ideas and <unk>.
about how to help people <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity.
And that research brought me to the <unk> <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> because I went to <unk> and then <unk> back.
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> -- people don't believe that creativity <unk> by men, OK?
It <unk> that creativity was this spirit <unk> <unk> and <unk> to men from some <unk> <unk> and <unk>, for <unk> and <unk> for reasons <unk> and <unk>, for <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> these <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of creativity.
<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, I decided to have a <unk> that <unk> <unk> from the far.
<unk> were the same idea, but we had the kind of <unk> of the spirit without a <unk>.
which is <unk>, because the <unk> didn't really <unk> that a <unk> was somebody who was particularly somebody.
I thought that a <unk> was this kind of <unk> <unk> that <unk> literally in the <unk> of a artist, a little bit like <unk>, and <unk> out of the artist and <unk> the work out of the artist and <unk> the result of that work.
<unk> <unk> here, that's the distance of the <unk> that I'm going to <unk> you from the results of your work.
And everybody <unk> that was how it was so that we were, right?
So artists were <unk> by <unk> things, how for example the too <unk>, isn't?
If your work was <unk>, it didn't <unk> everything, all <unk> that <unk> had been <unk> by this <unk> <unk>.
If your work <unk>, it wasn't all <unk>, right?
Everybody <unk> that was your <unk> to be a <unk>.
And so people <unk> <unk> <unk> creativity.
Then the <unk> <unk> and all <unk>, and we <unk> this big idea; we put the human <unk> at the center of the universe above all of the universe and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> this big idea;
This was the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and people started thinking that creativity is completely <unk> by <unk>.
And for the first time in history, it <unk> to this or that artist as a <unk> <unk> rather than one person with <unk>.
And I have to say, I think it was a big <unk>.
I think I started somebody, a simple person to believe that they're like a source, like a source, <unk> and <unk> and <unk> of all the <unk> <unk>, <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> is a responsibility to <unk> human <unk>.
It's like to ask someone of the <unk>.
<unk> and <unk> completely <unk> the <unk> and <unk> all these <unk> <unk> on the <unk>.
And I think it was this pressure to <unk> artists in <unk> 500 years.
And, if this is true, and I think it's, the question, and now?
Can we do that?
It's going to be like to a <unk> understanding between human and <unk> <unk>.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we can't <unk> 500 years of thinking about a 18 minutes.
And there's probably people in the audience who <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of <unk>, you do do that <unk> people <unk> <unk> <unk> on their projects.
<unk> you don't <unk> you all about this thing.
But the question I want to tell you is -- why not?
Why don't we work in this way?
Because it's more sense of everything that I ever heard about to explain the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> process.
A process that, as anyone who ever <unk> to do something -- so, basically, everybody is, you don't know, you don't <unk> <unk>.
And in fact, it can <unk> look completely <unk>.
I did this <unk> with the extraordinary <unk> <unk>, who has now 90 years, but that was a <unk> for all of life and said that during his <unk> <unk>, and he said that during his <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> out of the <unk>, <unk> out of the <unk> <unk>.
He said it was like a <unk> <unk>.
And that <unk> <unk> towards her <unk>.
I was <unk> to <unk>, because he was <unk> the earth under his feet.
I thought I had one thing to do at that point, and he was, words, "<unk> as a <unk>."
And so he was <unk> to the house and he was <unk> by this <unk>, and he didn't have to get any other paper and a <unk> <unk> enough, while the <unk> and <unk> on the page.
<unk> times times, he didn't start to be <unk>, so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> and she would <unk> the <unk> through and she would have <unk> <unk> through the <unk>, looking for, looking, like she said, "another <unk>."
Then there were those times -- this piece never <unk> -- there were some times when the was almost <unk>, OK?
So, he was <unk> home and he was looking at home and I had a <unk> <unk> in the <unk>, and he was a <unk> <unk> right in the while he was <unk>, and he was <unk> up with the other hand and the <unk>.
<unk> the <unk> from the tail and the <unk> in his body and the <unk> on the page.
And in these cases, the <unk> would be <unk> on the page, and <unk>, but at the last word to the first word to the first word to the first word to the first.
So when I <unk> <unk> -- it's <unk>, it's <unk>, it's exactly <unk> to my <unk> process.
Not all my <unk> process -- I'm not a <unk>!
I'm a <unk>, and my way of <unk> is; I <unk> at the same <unk> every day and <unk> and work and <unk> above it.
But even I even, in my <unk>, I <unk> against that, sometimes.
And I think that many of you the <unk> fact.
You know, even if the work and ideas <unk> me <unk> from a certain source, I couldn't have to be <unk>.
And what is this thing?
And how can we <unk> it to it in a way we don't have to lose their head, but rather, what's going to do you <unk>?
As I <unk>, the best example, I have a better <unk>, which I've been <unk> <unk>, which I've been <unk> for a <unk>.
<unk> <unk> of this, and you know, <unk>, for the <unk> of life was the <unk> of the <unk> artist <unk>, trying to control, <unk> these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
But then he was <unk>, and a day while he was <unk> on a <unk> <unk>, <unk> everything for him.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>, and all of a <unk> <unk>, that comes into his head as <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and it's <unk>, and the <unk>, but it doesn't know how to <unk>.
It's not a piece of paper, it's not a <unk>, it's not a <unk>.
So he starts to feel this kind of old <unk> <unk> <unk> in him, "I'm going to lose, and I'm going to <unk> and <unk> from this <unk> song.
I'm not enough <unk>, and I can't <unk>. "
And instead of going to <unk>, they <unk>.
He <unk> the whole process of <unk> and made something completely new.
He just <unk> the sky and said, "<unk>, you don't see I'm <unk>?"
"It seems to you know, you can write a song now?
If you really want to <unk>, you'll get a more <unk> when I can take care of you.
<unk>, <unk> to <unk> more <unk>.
I started to <unk> <unk> <unk>. "
And his <unk> process, he <unk> after this.
I didn't work, it was still <unk> as always.
But the process, and the <unk> <unk> that <unk> was <unk> when he <unk> the <unk>, the <unk> that outside of him, the <unk> that the problems and <unk> it <unk> back where he was, he <unk> that it didn't have to be a <unk>.
But I <unk> this <unk>, wonderful <unk> <unk> a conversation between <unk> and this <unk> thing that <unk> and <unk>, but it was not <unk>.
So, how I started to change a little bit of how I <unk> and I <unk> it was <unk> to me.
This idea, I was <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and I <unk> in one of those <unk> in which we all have when we're working on something and you don't have a <unk>, that's going to be the book.
Not just <unk>, just the <unk> book.
And I started thinking about <unk> this project.
But then I <unk> to <unk> that I <unk> up the air and <unk> us.
So I <unk> my face on the <unk> and <unk> my <unk> to a <unk> <unk> of the room.
And I said to <unk>, "<unk>, what, we know, we all know that, if this book is not going to be <unk>.
Because, as you see, I'm <unk> everything that I have, I don't have any more of this.
So if you want it to be better, you have to do your side and do your side.
OK. But if you don't do it, you know what, you don't do it.
I started writing the same because it's my work.
And I would like to say that I'm <unk> to do my <unk>. "Because -- at the end is so, OK -- <unk> -- <unk>, OK -- <unk> -- <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> and <unk> music that <unk> hours until <unk>.
And they were always <unk>, because the <unk> were <unk> and <unk>.
But every <unk>, <unk>, something <unk>, and one of these artists actually <unk>.
And I know what I'm going to talk about, because I know that you have seen at some point, a <unk>.
It was like if the time <unk>, and the <unk> <unk> through a kind of <unk> and it was not doing anything different from the <unk>, like the <unk> <unk> before, but everything <unk>.
And suddenly we don't just <unk> as a human.
But it <unk> from <unk> and <unk> in the fire of the <unk>.
And when this <unk>, at the time, people <unk> what he was, he <unk> with his name.
<unk> your hands and <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, God, God," God, "God," God, "
That's God, you know.
<unk> <unk> <unk>, when the <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> this <unk> with them and <unk> <unk> in <unk> by <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>,
In <unk>, when a artist has done something impossible and <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> -- a <unk> of God.
And it's <unk> because we need.
But the problem comes up the day after the <unk>, when you <unk> and <unk> that are the <unk> 11 <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> of God's not there.
It's just a <unk> <unk> with <unk>, and maybe you never <unk> to get it to that <unk>.
And perhaps nobody <unk> the name of God still God, and so that it has to do with the rest of his life?
It's hard.
This is one of the most <unk> <unk> to do in a <unk> life.
But perhaps it doesn't have to be so <unk> if you can't believe, <unk>, the most <unk> of your being being being being being being <unk>.
But I just <unk> that you're <unk> data in <unk> by a source of this <unk> part of your life that you have to go to <unk>.
And, you know, if we think about this way, everything changes.
And so I started to <unk>, and it's <unk> for several months in the <unk> of the book that I was going to be <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> of my success.
And what I have to continue to <unk> when I feel like this is, I don't fear.
<unk>. <unk> only your work.
<unk> to <unk> for your side, any <unk> can be.
If your work is <unk>, <unk>.
If the <unk>, you will <unk> to you <unk> a few kind of <unk>, for one moment through your <unk>, then, "<unk>!"
<unk>, you do the same <unk> your <unk>.
And <unk>! "<unk>!" <unk>. "
I think, and I think it's <unk>.
"<unk>!" <unk>! "<unk>, even for having a human <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk>: <unk>!
As I know, I talked about some of these projects on the human genome, what can <unk> and the discovery of new <unk> of genes.
Now we're <unk> a new way, we started to <unk> biology biology and now starting from that digital code, we're <unk> in a new <unk> of biology, <unk> and <unk> life.
We always tried to <unk> <unk>.
"<unk> is life?" It's something that many <unk>, I think they're going to figure out at various levels.
We tried different <unk>, <unk> to <unk> terms.
We're <unk> about 20 years, now.
When we <unk> the human genome <unk> to <unk> from the <unk> world of biology in the digital world of the computer.
Now, we can <unk> life, or create new life from this digital universe?
This is the map of a little <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, which is the species from the genome genome between those who can <unk> into the lab.
And we tried to reduce the genome to <unk> one even smaller.
We're able to <unk> a <unk> of the <unk> about 500 that are here.
But when we look at his <unk> map, it's <unk> simple than our.
<unk>, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can <unk>, one at the time, it's very <unk> that this can bring to a <unk> cell.
So I thought the only way to <unk> was <unk> this <unk> so that we could <unk> the <unk> <unk> to <unk> some of these questions.
And so we started the <unk> of the <unk>, we can <unk> a <unk>?
Can the chemistry <unk> of these big molecules that we never could make this before we've been able to create before?
And, in case, can we make a <unk>?
A <unk> is just a piece of <unk> <unk>.
The speed that we can <unk> life is <unk> to <unk>.
Our ability to write the code, instead, <unk> slowly, but it's <unk>.
And our most <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We've <unk> over 15 years ago.
The process has <unk> a lot of <unk>, <unk> with a <unk> <unk> before we <unk> the early experiments.
But we found that <unk> of DNA is very hard.
There's <unk> of thousands of cars in the world that <unk> little <unk> of DNA, <unk> <unk> <unk>, and it's a <unk> process: the more <unk> is a <unk> process.
So we had to develop a new <unk> to <unk> these <unk> and <unk> the <unk>.
And this was our first <unk>, <unk> from information to the genome of the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's a little virus that <unk> bacteria.
We designed <unk>, <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> a <unk> of DNA <unk> about <unk> <unk>.
The interesting part is when we took this piece of <unk> <unk> <unk> and we <unk> it in bacteria, bacteria have <unk> to read this code and <unk> <unk> particles.
<unk> particles have been <unk> by cells, they're <unk> back and they <unk> the <unk> <unk>.
I talked about a recent members of the <unk> industry that they certainly <unk> this model.
They have more of you.
<unk> that this is a situation where the software can actually build his same <unk> in a <unk> system.
But I could do the biggest things in the biggest things.
We had to build the whole <unk> of the <unk>.
They're more than <unk> <unk> <unk>.
So we thought we thought about the size of the virus, so we can change the <unk> to understand what the <unk> of a <unk> cell.
<unk> is <unk>, and if we <unk> information in a computer, these must be very <unk>.
When I <unk> this genome for the first time in the <unk> <unk> was a <unk> for every <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We found, <unk>, 30 <unk>. If we were <unk> that original sequence never <unk> could do it.
One part of the process is to design <unk> 50 <unk> that <unk> with all the other <unk> of 50 <unk> to build smaller <unk> that <unk> together.
<unk> elements here.
You've probably read that <unk> us.
<unk> so: we have a <unk> code on four <unk>: At the <unk>, <unk>, <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> of those <unk> <unk> <unk> together about 20 <unk>, and there's a <unk> order to <unk> every <unk>.
So we can use the code for <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
What we did at the beginning was <unk>.
Some of them were <unk> by the fact that it wasn't.
We designed these <unk> to <unk> just <unk> with <unk>.
There's <unk> that we <unk> them and <unk> <unk>.
And we started to <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
But anyway, we made these <unk> in <unk> so that we're <unk> to make a very <unk> <unk>, as you'll see in a minute.
We're trying to <unk> the process.
So, this seems the <unk> of a <unk>.
When you get to these very <unk>, over 100 <unk> <unk>, not <unk> <unk> <unk>, not <unk> directly in the <unk> <unk>.
You get to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> biology.
So we've <unk> some other <unk>.
<unk> of another <unk> called <unk> <unk>, which in biology <unk> to <unk> the DNA to <unk> the <unk> to <unk>.
Here's an example.
This <unk>, called <unk> <unk>, can <unk> three million <unk> of <unk>.
You can see in the <unk> <unk> like his <unk> <unk>.
<unk> -- 24 hours is <unk> <unk> as it was before.
<unk> thousands of organisms that are able to do that.
These organisms can <unk> completely <unk>.
We could live under <unk>.
I'm absolutely sure that life <unk> in space, and you're <unk> to find new <unk> of water <unk>.
<unk>, NASA showed that this is.
This is an image of the <unk> that we've built using these <unk>, just using the <unk> with the <unk> design of <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk>.
This image was not <unk> with a <unk> <unk>, but with a <unk> <unk>.
It's a <unk> so big that we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk>.
These are pictures that <unk> a period of about six seconds.
This is the <unk> that we've done a little time ago.
They're more than <unk> <unk>.
It's the largest <unk> of a <unk> structure ever <unk> by man.
It's got a <unk> weight <unk>.
If you <unk> it with a <unk> 10 without spaces, we'll just <unk> pages to <unk> this code.
Now, how do we work? How can we <unk> it?
<unk>, by a virus is a game from kids.
It's a little more <unk> when you're using the bacteria.
It's <unk> even when it's about cells like our: you can just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> another, which is basically the process of <unk>.
In <unk>, we <unk> the <unk> is instead <unk> inside the cell, but we <unk> <unk> that we can do a <unk> <unk> that we can do a <unk> <unk> of a cell from a <unk> cell to another and <unk>.
We <unk> a <unk> <unk> from a species.
<unk> are the two different as men from <unk>.
We have <unk> some <unk> in a way that you could decide what to do for this <unk>.
He <unk> it <unk> with <unk> so that we <unk> all the <unk>.
And when we put it in the cell was <unk> and <unk> our <unk> <unk> the new <unk> went inside the cell.
And we thought that we didn't go beyond, but we tried to <unk> it in there.
This is one of the <unk> <unk> of evolution.
We found that <unk> species have <unk> a second or a third <unk> from some of the <unk>, <unk> in a second thousands of new <unk> to that species.
So who think about evolution as a only <unk> at the time, you know, it's not not a lot of biology.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> that was in the cell didn't <unk> one.
The <unk> <unk> we've <unk> it.
It's <unk>, and it <unk> the other <unk> as <unk>, has <unk>, and we <unk> with only the cell and the new <unk>.
It's become blue because of the genes we've <unk>.
And in a short short <unk> of time, all the <unk> of a species, you go to a <unk> of all in a new species, <unk> on the new software that we <unk> in the cell.
All the <unk> are <unk>, the <unk> are <unk>, and when we <unk> the code <unk> <unk> exactly what we've <unk>.
Now, this may seem <unk> <unk>, but we'll <unk> the software, we can change the things in a <unk> <unk>.
Now, I've already <unk> that there's not a <unk> -- but of progress at the progress of the <unk> and a half million years of evolution, and I said that maybe we're going to create a new version of the <unk> <unk> that we could <unk> new species on this digital process.
Why do that?
I think it's enough <unk> when we think about our <unk>.
We're going to go from six billion and a half the next 40 years.
<unk> for example: I was born in <unk>.
Now there's three people on the planet to <unk> in <unk>; in 40 years, there's four years, there's four.
We're <unk> problems now to find food, water and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> for six billion and a half of people.
I'll even more <unk> to do that for nine billion.
<unk> more than five billion <unk>, over 30 billion <unk> <unk>.
That means 100 million <unk> a day.
When we try to find <unk> <unk>, or any kind of process to <unk>, it's going to be a huge challenge.
<unk> we have to realize all of the CO2 from these materials that we <unk> in the atmosphere.
At day, because of the <unk> <unk> in the world, we have a <unk> with about 20 million genes, and I like like to think are the <unk> <unk> for the future.
The <unk> industry only <unk> a <unk> about a <unk>, and you think about how many different things are outside.
Our <unk> here is <unk> data from the <unk> reality and our imagination.
Now we have <unk>, because of these <unk> <unk> <unk>, able to create what we call <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We can build a big robot that can produce a million <unk> <unk> a day.
Think of these 20 million genes or try to <unk> <unk> to produce <unk> or <unk>, new <unk>, can change, with a small team, and we can change, because of a small team and create more <unk> biology that we can change, with a little team and create more <unk> biology in the last 20 years of science.
And it's just a <unk> <unk>.
We can choose to <unk> <unk>, chemistry or <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This is a <unk> of some <unk> software that we're working on to be able to <unk> and design species at computers.
Well, we don't know how they're going to be.
We know exactly what their code is.
Now we're going to <unk> on the <unk> generation.
You also saw you who <unk> from the <unk> was a <unk> experiment.
We have <unk> <unk> <unk> as soon as <unk> as soon as the <unk> <unk> or different kinds of <unk> as <unk> or different kinds of <unk>.
But the only way that biology can reach this purpose, and we think we can have a big impact without <unk> the cost of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, and we're working on to design cells that can reach this purpose, and we think we can reach that we can reach the first <unk> of <unk> in about 18 months.
<unk> <unk> with CO2 is a <unk>, but in our <unk> <unk>, and we found different <unk>.
This is a <unk> that we've <unk> in <unk>.
<unk> in the deep ocean, about <unk> feet of the <unk> of water.
<unk> <unk> by CO2 using hydrogen <unk> as a source of energy.
We're trying to figure out if we can easily be <unk> by <unk>, <unk> that can easily be <unk> by <unk>, <unk> that CO2 in <unk>, to drive this process.
So, we think of short, we think we could be able to <unk> what the basic question that is what is the <unk> of "we have the <unk> goal of <unk> the whole <unk> industry.
<unk>. If you can't do it from TED, where can't it?
It's a <unk> source of energy.
<unk>, we're working on the same <unk> to create <unk> <unk>.
You've seen this year with flu, we've always come back a dollar in less when it's about finding the right <unk>.
I think what you can change building <unk> <unk>.
This is how the future could start to look like <unk>, now, the tree of evolution, <unk> the tree with bacteria <unk>, <unk>, and then then <unk> cells.
We're so <unk> people.
Our purpose is to do so so we can live enough to try to <unk>. Thank you very much.
First of all, I'll show you, the <unk> <unk>, some <unk> work, some fundamental technology, the new technology that we brought up to the <unk> <unk>. It's <unk>.
It's a environment that you can <unk> is at local level that you can <unk> with a huge <unk> of data.
And here we're looking at <unk> <unk> <unk> with a kind of <unk> and <unk>, for a fast <unk>, <unk> <unk> the images like we want.
And it doesn't matter how big the amount of information that we see, how big these <unk> of data or images.
Most of them are <unk> photographs, but this is a <unk> <unk> by the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, and <unk> in the <unk> of 300 <unk>.
It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that <unk> the <unk> of a system like this is the number of <unk> on your screen at any time. It's also a very <unk> architecture.
This is a whole book, example of data not images.
This is the <unk> <unk>. Every <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk>.
And to <unk> that's really about the <unk> and not of images, we can do something like this, to actually see that it's about a real <unk> of the text, not a picture.
It could be a way to read a <unk> book.
I don't tell you.
This is an <unk> example. This is a more <unk> example.
Every image is the beginning of a <unk>.
And it really gives you the pleasure and the beautiful experience of read the real version of a <unk>, which is for nature a <unk>, which is for nature a <unk> like a <unk> of a <unk>.
We also did something with the corner of this particular number of the <unk>.
We created a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of what you use is <unk> in a normal <unk>, and we <unk> you <unk> it.
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk>, you can see here.
Or other models, or even the <unk> <unk>.
And this really <unk> some of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of space on the screen.
I thought this <unk> would be <unk> and other <unk> <unk>, not <unk> to be <unk>.
Of course, <unk> is one of the most <unk> <unk> for this kind of technology.
And on this <unk>, I don't want to lose time, if not say we have <unk> to do this field.
These are all the <unk> in the United States <unk> above a NASA <unk>.
So now I started something else.
This is actually alive in the web; you can <unk> to see.
This is a project called <unk>, which <unk> two different technologies.
One is <unk> and the other is a <unk> <unk> computers that made by <unk> <unk>, a student of the <unk> of Washington, with the <unk> <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And it's alive on the web, <unk> by <unk>.
You can <unk> when we do this kind of <unk>, where we can go from an image to the other <unk> and have this kind of experience to <unk>.
But the <unk> <unk> of the pictures here is actually actually actually a meaning.
The <unk> of <unk> of the computer have <unk> these pictures together, so that we <unk> to <unk> the <unk> <unk> that we <unk> all <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> have been <unk>. So here's see the elements of the <unk> <unk>, and these things are all <unk> at <unk>.
I don't know if I have time to show you some other environment.
There's a lot more <unk>.
I want to go directly to one of the <unk> <unk> of <unk> and this <unk> from a <unk> <unk> <unk> that we made for the first time the summer to show you what <unk> is really the key behind this technology, the <unk> technology. And it's not so <unk> <unk> <unk> looking at the <unk> that we put in the website.
We had to <unk> <unk> and forth.
This is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> of kinds of <unk> and <unk> of kinds of <unk>, other <unk> and <unk> and so forth. <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a image that's <unk> to this model.
So I'm all <unk> <unk> and have been all <unk> <unk> at the <unk> level in this way.
And it's possible to <unk> this way.
You know, I would never have thought of the way to work.
It's very <unk> <unk> to this kind of <unk> here.
I think you can see that it's a lot of different kinds of <unk>: from those <unk> <unk> to the <unk> <unk>, a number <unk>, <unk> number together in this environment.
And if I can, I <unk> to try and <unk>.
A lot of them are <unk>, etc..
<unk> here is a series of photographs here -- <unk>.
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We can go from the <unk> to the physics of this environment.
The <unk> point is that we can do things with social environment. This is now <unk> data from the whole memory of how to <unk> the Earth, from the <unk> <unk> of <unk> and <unk> all that data together.
All those pictures are <unk> together, more than the <unk>.
You have a model of the entire <unk>.
Think about this as <unk> <unk>'s work on Earth <unk>.
It's something that <unk> in <unk> of <unk> as people <unk>, and which <unk> for who <unk> <unk> with the use of the use of it.
Their pictures are <unk> with <unk> <unk> by other people.
If somebody is the idea of <unk> all these <unk> <unk> the name, my picture of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> all of that data, and I can use it as a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in that space, using the <unk> of <unk> in that space, using the picture of <unk>, and have a social experience, and <unk>.
Of course, a <unk> of all that are <unk> <unk> of every interesting part of the Earth, <unk> not only not <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I realized? What's your software <unk> us to do is that at some point, in the next years, all the <unk> photographs of them from anyone in the world. <unk> will be <unk> together?
<unk>: Yeah. What's doing is basically, it's <unk>.
It's creating <unk>, if you want, between pictures.
And he's doing it in the base of the pictures.
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the <unk> information that many of these <unk> images.
As you do a research of images on the web, you <unk> a <unk> and the text on the page on the web has a lot of information about the pictures of the picture.
Now, what's going if that picture is <unk> to all your picture?
So the amount of <unk> <unk> and the amount of <unk> that <unk> is really enormous. It's a <unk> effect of the network.
CA: <unk>, it's really amazing. <unk>.
<unk>: I'm going to tell you a lot.
One of the major <unk> when you <unk> and one of the <unk> research is that to live between who has no <unk> <unk>, between who <unk> the past the wind, the <unk> <unk> <unk> by <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> by <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> thinking that <unk> <unk> still over the <unk> <unk>, or the <unk> <unk> <unk>, or the <unk> <unk> <unk> are still <unk> <unk>, or <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the <unk>, and the idea that the world in which we don't have in any sense, but it's just a reality, it's a <unk> of reality, but only a model of the <unk>,
<unk> of a particular <unk> of <unk> choices that our <unk> did, or bad, a lot of <unk> does.
And, of course, everybody <unk> <unk>.
Everybody <unk>. <unk>.
We're <unk> to <unk>.
We need to <unk> <unk>, so we don't have to <unk> us if we <unk> and <unk> --
We all have a art.
What <unk> is the particular <unk> of the song, the <unk> of every culture.
It doesn't matter that are the <unk> of the <unk>, or the <unk> of <unk>, or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, or <unk> <unk> <unk>, or a <unk> in the <unk> <unk>, or a <unk> in the <unk> of <unk>.
He was my <unk> of the journey of the <unk> <unk> a month ago, or a <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk>, the <unk> mother of the world.
All of these <unk> <unk> that there are other ways of thinking, other ways of thinking, other ways of moving in the world.
And if you look at a second, it's a concept that can give you hope.
<unk>, the <unk> <unk> of the world create a <unk> life and <unk> that <unk> the planet, and it's important for the <unk> of the planet, how the <unk> <unk> <unk> as a <unk> <unk>.
And you can think about this <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and you can <unk> the <unk> of all the <unk>, dreams, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, ideas, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, ideas, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, ideas
The <unk> is the <unk> of humanity.
It's the <unk> of what we are and what we can be as as <unk> species.
And <unk> <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> was <unk> <unk> and <unk> very quickly.
<unk> <unk>, for example, <unk> that 50 percent of all species was or on the <unk> of <unk>, because it's <unk>, or -- in the <unk> of <unk> -- and <unk> -- and you don't even even even <unk> <unk> <unk> -- that <unk> diversity.
The <unk> of that is, of course, the <unk> <unk>.
When you're <unk> <unk> <unk> on this planet.
A language is not only <unk> by a <unk> or a series of rules.
One is the <unk> of the human spirit.
It's the way that the <unk> of every culture comes in in the material world.
Every language is a forest of the mind, a <unk>, a <unk> of <unk>.
And of those <unk> <unk>, while we're here at least, at least half, it's not <unk> in the <unk> of children.
They don't get <unk> to kids, which means, unless you do something, which are already not something, which are already death.
What's more <unk> than being <unk> by the <unk>, of the last last to talk about a language, of the last <unk>, not how do we <unk> the <unk> of the kids?
This <unk> <unk> was a <unk> of somebody in some of the world every two weeks: every two weeks a <unk> <unk> and brings it into the <unk> <unk> of a <unk> language.
And I know, somebody of you, "It's not that?
The world would not be a better place if we could all the same language? "<unk>, then we're all going to talk about it. <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>.
<unk> of a <unk> thing that means we can't talk their language.
I'd like to give you a journey through the <unk> --
a little journey in the <unk> to give you a <unk> of what we're <unk>.
Most of us <unk> that when I say, "different ways of <unk>," I mean, "I mean," I really think, different ways of <unk>.
<unk> for example, this <unk> <unk>, <unk>, the <unk> of the <unk>, who <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's a <unk> that's not able to <unk> the blue color from the green because the <unk> <unk> is <unk> in the <unk>, where the <unk> is <unk>.
They have a <unk> language and a rule <unk>, <unk> <unk>, "You have to <unk> a person who's talking about a different language.
All this has <unk> in the past <unk>, yet the <unk> is that in these families <unk> where they talk about six or seven <unk> because of the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
You start to listen and then he started talking.
<unk> one of the most interesting <unk> that I lived, the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, an incredible incredible incredible <unk> that he had the first <unk> in <unk>.
In <unk> five <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk>.
They've done by the <unk> photographs that <unk> them in <unk> <unk>, who <unk> that this <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> had never seen anything.
They <unk> the pictures of the earth, they <unk> to the research of a form or a <unk> and, not <unk>, nothing, they <unk> that <unk> <unk>, and they <unk> the five <unk> with <unk>.
But <unk> not only <unk> <unk>.
They <unk> between them.
<unk> percent of the <unk> was <unk> by their own.
We're <unk> to eight <unk> and we found two cases of death and when we <unk> to know, they <unk> that one of them was so <unk> that it's dead <unk>, and then they <unk> it.
<unk> were able to recognize the animal <unk> from 40 <unk> and <unk> the species.
<unk> years old, I was <unk> a very interesting task when my <unk> <unk> <unk> me if I wanted to go to <unk> between society's <unk> to the base of <unk> and <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to do <unk>.
To make sense of <unk>, I should understand culture and that <unk> is not <unk> <unk>.
It's quite a <unk> <unk> vision of the world.
Very interesting.
If you try to <unk> the great <unk> of the world, what do you do?
<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, etc..
A continent is always <unk> out, thinking that Africa <unk> doesn't have <unk> <unk>. And instead, and the <unk> is not the other than the <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk>.
What makes interesting is the <unk> relationship between life and death.
So <unk> are <unk> to <unk>.
<unk> can be <unk> by the <unk> <unk>, <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the live in the way that for a short moment the <unk> becomes the <unk>.
For this <unk> <unk> to say, "<unk> <unk> go to <unk> God.
We <unk> in <unk> and <unk> God. "
And from the moment that you're <unk>, is the spirit that you can get you bad?
So, you <unk> to these incredible events: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> rather <unk> of the power of the mind when it's <unk> in a state of <unk>.
<unk> all the <unk> that I've been <unk> with the most <unk> <unk> are the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, in <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that once <unk> on the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk>.
In a <unk> continent <unk>, this <unk> never been <unk> by <unk>.
<unk> today are <unk> by a <unk>, but their <unk> is extraordinary.
<unk> <unk> are <unk> from <unk> to <unk> or four years, and they live in a world fact of <unk> and <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> for 18 years.
Two years <unk> of nine years <unk> by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
For this time, they're <unk> to the values of their society, values that <unk> their <unk> and only <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or to say the <unk> <unk> -- or to say the <unk> <unk>.
At the end of this incredible <unk>, they're <unk> out and for the first time in their life, at age of 18, see a <unk>. And in that moment of the first <unk>, when the sun <unk> <unk> <unk>, everything that they learned in theory in the <unk>. The <unk> is all about <unk> theory. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, everything that they've learned in the <unk> theory. <unk> says, and it says,
"<unk>? I tell you.
It's <unk>. Now it's about you. "
They call <unk> <unk> and they say that we are, <unk> <unk>, we are the <unk> of the world.
This level <unk> is extremely important.
When we think about <unk> <unk> and the <unk> environment and the old <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, which is a concept in his <unk> or maybe <unk> <unk> and say that these are <unk> <unk> to the Earth.
<unk> <unk> are not <unk> <unk>.
There's no space for these things in the <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk>, but because of the time and <unk>, they created a <unk> of the Earth <unk> not on the concept of <unk> <unk>, but on a <unk> <unk>, the concept that the Earth can live because it's <unk> by human <unk>.
What does it mean?
I mean that a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> that the mountain is a <unk> <unk> that <unk> its <unk> is going to be a different human being will be <unk> <unk> different and will have a <unk> different relationship with the mountain or that place, which is going to be a <unk> <unk> <unk> to be <unk>.
<unk> is a <unk> of a spirit or a <unk> is <unk>.
What's interesting is the <unk> that <unk> the relationship between the <unk> and the natural world.
I grew up in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> to be <unk>.
That made me a different human being friends from my <unk> friends who believe that <unk> are the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> who live in the <unk> <unk>, <unk> that are <unk> in the <unk> <unk>.
If we started to <unk> that these <unk> can create reality, different, we can start understanding some of them <unk>.
I <unk> this picture at <unk> in the <unk> <unk>.
Maybe some of you have heard about the <unk>, the most powerful <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk>.
What makes the <unk> is not the potential <unk> of the <unk>, but its <unk>. It's <unk> by two elements.
On one hand, this <unk> <unk> that <unk> a series of <unk>, <unk> and <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
<unk> the only <unk> <unk>, you have a little <unk> that <unk> a little bit of the <unk>, but it's <unk> with the <unk> of a family <unk> said.
This <unk> <unk> <unk>, very similar to the <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
If you ever see the <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk>, which are doing a different <unk> of species, <unk> it <unk> it.
<unk> that <unk> on the <unk> is a little bit like being <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a sea of electricity. <unk>'t create a <unk> of electricity. <unk>'t creates a <unk> of reality; it creates the <unk> of reality.
I often <unk> with my <unk>, Richard <unk> <unk>, the man who <unk> the man who <unk> was <unk>, with his discovery of <unk> <unk> in the <unk>.
My <unk> is not <unk> these <unk> as a <unk> because if you did not tell anybody you can't tell anybody about being <unk>. <unk>, but they're not <unk> because they're <unk> by a <unk> that's <unk>, of course, <unk> <unk>.
It's possible to <unk> <unk> only if we <unk> with other <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk>.
Now, the <unk> that are in this <unk> are <unk>, the same kind of necessary to <unk> the same kind of necessary to <unk> the <unk>. The question is: in a <unk> <unk> <unk> of plants, how these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, not similar, but that if you <unk> in this way, create a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We use the great <unk> of <unk> and <unk>, which can <unk> <unk>.
But if we <unk> to <unk>, we <unk>, we're talking about the <unk>, "<unk> talk."
What does it mean?
This <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, who <unk> <unk> in the forest, and our eyes <unk> in the same species.
If they <unk> them, they <unk> us, "<unk> <unk> <unk>, you know, you don't know?" I said, "No."
The solution is: You take the <unk> <unk> in a night of the moon and <unk> with a different <unk>.
With this not <unk>, but it's a lot more interesting that we <unk> the <unk>.
Now, the problem is that even those of us who have heart <unk> <unk> <unk> them, but somehow <unk> to the <unk> of the history of the world than our real world, and <unk> <unk>.
In fact, the <unk> century, by 300 years, not <unk> <unk> for its <unk> or its <unk> <unk> <unk>, but rather like it was where we <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of the mass <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the planet. Now the problem is not the change.
All the <unk> through <unk> were <unk> in a <unk> to new possibilities of life.
And the problem is not technology.
<unk> <unk> have no <unk> to be <unk> when they put <unk> <unk> and <unk> so much as the <unk> <unk> don't have <unk> when they <unk> <unk>, they didn't have <unk> when they put <unk> <unk> and <unk>.
It's not the change or technology that <unk> the <unk> of the <unk>. It's the power.
The <unk> <unk> of <unk>.
And if you look at the world, I'll see that these are not <unk> <unk>.
They're <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> out of the <unk> forces that are over their <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> --
a <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk>, a <unk> who lived free in the forest to a generation ago, and now <unk> to the <unk> <unk>, where you can see the <unk> <unk> <unk>, where you can see the <unk> <unk> from the <unk> that looks like <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, where where it, where
I started <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> to the forest.
Or, in <unk>, are the diseases that are <unk> with the <unk> discovery of <unk>.
If we <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk>, where I'm doing a lot of research, you'll see the <unk> of the political <unk>.
As <unk> <unk>, the physics of a <unk>, is <unk> at the <unk> level, but <unk>, the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk>, not only is not <unk>, but <unk> <unk> in some <unk>, because it's a part of the development.
And you can't understand the <unk> of the <unk> until you don't go out of the beginning.
I <unk> miles from <unk> in China through the Western <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> with a young <unk>, but only <unk> to <unk> with a young <unk>, but only come to <unk>. I've got a <unk> of the <unk> that we talk about.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> million people <unk> from the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk>.
The father of this guy was <unk> to the <unk> <unk>.
which means that it was <unk> to the <unk> of Chinese times.
<unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> that he brought the <unk> in <unk>.
My mother was <unk> and his <unk> was <unk>.
It was <unk> by <unk> in <unk> at age age of two <unk> under his <unk> because he couldn't have no <unk>.
The <unk>, who did the same, was <unk> in <unk> <unk>.
One day, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and, for this <unk>, was <unk> to the work for seven years.
The <unk> of the <unk> can be <unk>, but the spirit of the <unk> is by <unk> present.
<unk>, all of the way, it's <unk> to a choice.
We live in the <unk> world, or we want to <unk> the world of diversity?
The great <unk> <unk> <unk>, before he said that his greatest fear was that, in our way to go to this <unk> <unk> vision of the world, not only <unk> the whole <unk> of the human imagination <unk> to a <unk> <unk> of thinking, but a day we <unk> us from a <unk> <unk> <unk> that there were other possibilities.
And it's <unk> to remember that our species is <unk> for <unk> years.
The <unk> <unk>, who gave us agriculture, which has <unk> us to <unk> <unk>, <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, creating the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk>, creating the <unk> of <unk>, creating the <unk> of the <unk>, and we talk about <unk> years ago.
The <unk> world <unk> has <unk> 300 years.
The story I didn't <unk> that we have the answers to all the challenges that we could <unk> in the <unk> to come.
When these <unk> <unk> of the world is asked what it means to be human, <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And it's in these answers that we all <unk> the possibility of being what we are: a species <unk>, that has to make that all the <unk> and all the <unk> can <unk>. And there's great moments of <unk>.
I <unk> this picture on the <unk> <unk> of <unk>, when I went to <unk> <unk> with <unk>, and this man, <unk>, <unk> me the wonderful story of his <unk>.
The <unk> government was not always <unk> with the <unk> <unk> and the '<unk> to <unk> our <unk>, we <unk> them in <unk>.
The <unk> of this man is <unk>.
The family, <unk> for his life, <unk> <unk> all the <unk>, and all his <unk>.
You know, the <unk> don't <unk>, <unk>.
The <unk> of <unk> were made of fish <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> of this man didn't <unk> by night or <unk> <unk>.
It's <unk> away, it's <unk> <unk> and <unk> in your hand. When I did it <unk>, he <unk> it <unk>, he <unk> it <unk> it <unk>.
He <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk> of <unk> and when <unk> <unk>, he <unk> a dog.
He <unk> the dog and created a <unk>, with the <unk> <unk> created a <unk>, and it's <unk> on the <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
<unk> talk about <unk>? <unk>. And this, in different ways, [<unk>] is the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and all the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and all the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> government <unk> <unk> to the total of an area of <unk> <unk> <unk> of an area of the largest <unk> California and <unk> together.
It's their new <unk>. It's called <unk>.
It's a <unk> <unk>. <unk> all the <unk> resources.
One <unk> example of how a <unk> can <unk> with his <unk>.
And, to end, I think it's quite <unk> at least at least at least at the <unk> of the planet, and I realized that they don't have any <unk>.
For somebody is home.
<unk> <unk> of the human imagination that <unk> to the <unk> of the times. And for us, the dreams of these kids, how dreams are are <unk> of the hope.
To end, we <unk> <unk> that <unk> are <unk> that <unk> never <unk> to anything.
I think we <unk> --
<unk> <unk> are not <unk>, but we believe that stories can change the world, and maybe we are the best <unk> to tell stories of the world. Every month our <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> our <unk> <unk>.
Our <unk> are <unk> by millions of people.
Our work is <unk> in <unk> to bring our public in places to <unk> our public <unk> from which <unk> <unk> from what they had seen and <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, we have to find a <unk> <unk> in a world and <unk>.
where <unk> of all <unk> can <unk> our <unk> <unk>.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some some of some things I wrote in this book that I hope you've heard and <unk> to some <unk>, in case, I don't <unk> them.
I want to start with what I call the <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> of what?
The <unk> <unk> of all <unk> society <unk> <unk> <unk>: "If we we want to <unk> our citizens" "" The way we want to do it is <unk> the freedom to do it is <unk> freedom <unk>. "
The reason is, on the side, in fact that the freedom is <unk>, is useful, <unk>, <unk> for human beings.
<unk> is in fact that if we are <unk>, each of us can do to do everything that we <unk> our <unk>, without no one that we <unk> our <unk>, without no one <unk> in our own own.
The way to <unk> the freedom is to <unk>.
More choices people, more <unk>, the more <unk>, and more their freedom, is their freedom,
This, <unk>, it's so <unk> <unk> in society that nobody <unk> to <unk>.
And it's also <unk> <unk> in our lives.
I'll show you some examples of what progress has made possible.
This is my <unk>. It's not particularly big.
I <unk> a simple note on the <unk> to <unk>.
In my <unk>, there's <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that nobody <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that you can buy for <unk> <unk> <unk> that you can buy a huge <unk> of <unk> in the <unk> that nobody <unk> already <unk> is to your <unk>.
This is what <unk>.
Then you go to the store <unk> to buy a <unk>: <unk>, radio, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
And in this <unk> <unk> store, there's a big number of <unk> <unk>.
We can make six million of different <unk> using the <unk> that there are in a <unk> store.
<unk> <unk> that there is <unk>.
<unk> <unk>: the world of <unk>.
Once, when I was a kid, you could get all the <unk> <unk>, who were <unk> by <unk> <unk>.
You <unk> the phone, you don't <unk>.
One <unk> of that, in the other, was that the phone, it was that the phone.
These times, they went.
Now we have a <unk> almost <unk> <unk>, especially between cell phones.
Here's the cell cell.
My <unk> is in the middle, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, and <unk> for <unk> <unk>.
If you haven't seen it in the store, you're quite <unk> that soon <unk>.
And what's going on on the end is that people <unk> and he does this question. And you know, what's the answer is, "No."
It's not possible to buy a phone that doesn't do things.
So, in other <unk> of life that are much more important than the <unk>, the same <unk> of choices.
<unk> <unk>: It's not going on in the United States that you're <unk> from the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> you what you have to do.
Instead, <unk> from <unk>, and the <unk> says, "OK, we could do it, or <unk> <unk>," <unk> "to have these <unk> and these <unk>." What do you want to do? "
You <unk> him, "<unk>, what do you want to do?"
And the <unk> says, "<unk> has these <unk> and these <unk>, and <unk> has these <unk> and these <unk>."
"What do you want to do?"
And you say, "<unk> if she was, what would you say?"
And the <unk>, "But I'm not she's."
The <unk> <unk> we call the <unk> of the <unk>, <unk> that does it look like a beautiful thing.
But actually, it's not that a <unk> the weight and <unk> of the decisions that's about something, <unk> the <unk>, <unk>, to <unk> the other than nothing -- and it's <unk> -- and so not in the <unk>, and so not in the <unk> to make the patient.
There's a huge <unk> of <unk> <unk>, people like me and you, that if you think about you don't have any sense, because we can't <unk>.
But if we can't <unk>, why do we <unk> them?
The answer is they want to be <unk> to <unk> the <unk> to <unk> the <unk>.
<unk> of so fundamental, how we're our <unk> now is a question of choice, how you see in this <unk>. "We don't want to <unk> kids. We don't want to <unk>. We don't have to be a <unk>. We have to <unk>.
And we can <unk> how many times we <unk>.
which means that every <unk>, you have to decide that kind of person.
<unk> to the family and <unk>, a time the common perspective, <unk> from almost anyone, was that you had to have the <unk> possible possible, and you could make kids kids as possible.
The only real choice was with who, not when, and even what they do after.
<unk>, everything is really to play.
They <unk> to students very smart, and they <unk> their 20 percent in less than a time.
And not because they're <unk>, not because they're less <unk>.
But why they're <unk>, <unk>, you know, "<unk> <unk> or not?"
"<unk> <unk> <unk> later? I have to think about kids or <unk>?"
I'm <unk> <unk>.
And they try to <unk> these questions, even if this <unk> doesn't get the <unk> that <unk> and not get a <unk> <unk> to my <unk>.
And they have to do that. They're important questions.
Now, the work: we're <unk>, like <unk> <unk>, because the technology <unk> us to work every minute, every day, from every corner of the planet, <unk> that from the <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, there's a <unk>, and I'm not going to say, where the <unk> works.
I don't tell you, because I want to use it.
What does, this incredible freedom of choice that we have about the work? Is we we have to decide, we have to decide at every moment, if we we have to work or not.
We can go to see our son to play <unk>, with the phone in a <unk>, the <unk> in the other, and the <unk>, <unk>.
And even if I'm all <unk>, every minute that we see our son, <unk> <unk>, we're also <unk>, "I have to <unk> this call?"
"I have to <unk> this letter? I have to <unk> this letter?"
And even when the answer is, "not," everything makes your <unk> of your son very different from what it would be in other conditions.
So, from any part of us, look, small and big things, life is a question of choices.
Once the world was this: <unk>, there were some possibilities, but not everything was a question of choice.
The world of today I'm going to say this: "It's a <unk> thing, or <unk>?"
The answer is <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, we know, so I'm going to talk about <unk>.
<unk> this choice <unk> two effects of people.
The first, <unk>, is that it <unk> instead of <unk>.
With a lot of <unk> between which you choose, it's very hard to do.
I'll give you an example, <unk> <unk> <unk>.
A <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, with <unk> <unk> society, <unk> <unk> society, with about a million <unk> <unk> in <unk> companies.
What she's discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk> of two percent.
With 50 <unk> <unk>, there's 10 percent in less than when they're <unk> only five. Why?
Because with 50 <unk> <unk>, is <unk> hard, and <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And <unk>, and again, <unk>, <unk>, and of course, <unk>, and of course, <unk> never comes out.
<unk> that doesn't mean that these <unk> <unk> <unk> food because they don't have enough money, it's not going to be enough money, it's so <unk> that we also <unk> the decision <unk> <unk>.
They're not <unk>, they're <unk> up to five <unk> <unk> for the year from <unk> <unk>, who would be <unk> to <unk>.
So <unk> is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> choices.
And I think we're going to be the world.
"And finally, for <unk>: <unk>, <unk> or <unk>?"
You know, you can't do the right decision, if it's for <unk>, right?
You don't want to choose the wrong wrong, and you'll get the wrong <unk>.
So this is the first effect. The second is that even if we can <unk> <unk> and make a choice, at the end, we're less <unk> by the result of how to <unk> states with <unk>.
And this for several reasons.
One of these is that with a lot of <unk> between which you have, and it's not perfect, it's not easy to imagine that it could make a different choice that would be better. And what happens is that the <unk> <unk> <unk> us to <unk> the choice, and the <unk> <unk> <unk> by the decision.
And even when it was a decision.
<unk> choices there are, more easy to <unk> than any <unk> of choice.
<unk>, there's what <unk> call.
Dan <unk> has <unk> very well as the value that we give things from what we're going to do with what we're going to.
<unk>, when there's a lot of <unk>, it's easy to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and being <unk> <unk> of the <unk> that you have choice.
Here's an example. I <unk> with all the ones that are not in New York.
But that's probably <unk>.
There's this <unk> to the <unk>.
A place of <unk>.
<unk> <unk>. <unk> day. It's all about them.
<unk> nothing. But what he's thinking, "Well, <unk>, <unk>, it's <unk>."
"All my <unk> are away."
"<unk> <unk> <unk> right in the house."
And it's going to go up with the idea that's <unk> -- every day -- the possibility of <unk> where it wants.
<unk> <unk> <unk> for what we have, even when the choice was <unk>.
And the <unk> that we have <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk> us to <unk> them as <unk>.
Here's another example.
This <unk> tells us a lot of things.
It's about the way to live the moment, and maybe the slowly slowly <unk>.
But the most important point is that you're <unk>, you don't want to do other.
The things that don't <unk> have a lot of <unk> that can make less <unk> what we do.
<unk> point: <unk> <unk> <unk>.
I tried it on my skin <unk> a new couple of <unk>.
<unk> <unk> always <unk>.
Once the <unk> were a <unk>, <unk>, they were <unk>, and they were <unk>, only after <unk> <unk> a life and <unk> a lot of times, I started going on.
So I started to <unk> a couple of a new when the <unk> were gone, and I said, "I need a couple of <unk>, this is my <unk>."
The <unk> said, "Do you want to <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>?"
They want them to <unk> or with <unk>? "
"<unk>, do you want to <unk>?"
"<unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk>? <unk> <unk> <unk> --" <unk> to <unk>.
I was <unk>, and after a little bit I could say, "I want the guy that was the only guy." He had no idea what it was, so for a hour. I <unk> all the <unk> <unk>, and then I <unk> from the store, <unk>, <unk> with the best <unk> of <unk> I ever had.
It was <unk>. With all that choice, I had <unk> the best.
But it <unk> me.
Why? I wrote a whole book for <unk>.
The reason I was worse is that with all that choice my <unk> were <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk> to be <unk>.
I had <unk> <unk>. I didn't <unk> anything about <unk> when I just had a guy, but when I was going to <unk>, at least one guy had to be perfect.
What I had <unk> was good, but not perfect.
After I <unk> that I <unk> with what I was <unk> in <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> in the life of people don't do the <unk> that these are <unk> <unk>.
And this <unk> <unk>, even when the results are good.
<unk> in the world of <unk> if it <unk>.
Because if I <unk>, I don't know what I'm talking about.
The truth <unk> more to this.
"Yes, it was better when you was worse," The reason why he was there there that when he was worse, it was possible to be <unk>.
<unk>, in the world that we live in -- <unk>, <unk> citizens with the <unk> of the <unk> that we can <unk> is that things are at the <unk>.
You never have to be <unk> <unk> because your <unk>, my <unk>, you're <unk>.
The <unk> of happiness -- what you're here -- is, "<unk> <unk>" Yes, "<unk> <unk>," Yes, you want. "
I mean, a little moment -- that I'm really <unk> and my wife is really <unk>.
I couldn't do better, I couldn't do it.
But <unk> is not always a <unk>.
<unk>, a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> when there's just that kind of <unk> is that when you're not <unk>, and you say, "Why?"
"Who is <unk>?" The answer is <unk>.
The world is <unk>. What could I do I do?
When there's hundreds of <unk>, and you'll <unk> a <unk>, and you'll <unk> who's the <unk>, it's clear that the <unk> you are.
I could do better.
With hundreds of <unk> available, there's not a <unk>.
So when people are taking decisions, even if the result is <unk>, they <unk> and they <unk> their <unk> to their own.
In the last years, the <unk> is <unk> in the <unk> world.
I think a <unk> <unk> -- not the only, but important -- of this <unk> <unk> is that people have <unk> experiences because the standard are too <unk>.
And when they have to <unk> this situation think that <unk> is they're their.
So the final result is that we're better, <unk>, but we <unk> it's worse.
Let me tell you.
This is the <unk> <unk>, what we're going to take for good and it's not true.
There's no <unk> that a little bit of choice is better than <unk> at all, but by this is not a lot of choice is better than a little bit.
There's a <unk> value, <unk>. I don't know what it is.
But I'm sure we've <unk> from a piece of the level where we <unk> our life.
Now, from the <unk> <unk> -- I've almost finished -- from the point of view, the <unk> is the <unk>.
What <unk> allows all this choice in society is the <unk> material.
There's a lot of places in the world, and you know, <unk> <unk>, where the problem is not that they <unk>.
The problem is that they have too <unk>.
So the <unk> I'm talking about is a <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> society.
And what <unk> does, and <unk> is this: <unk> <unk> <unk> you talked about yesterday about how <unk> and <unk> <unk> to <unk> are <unk>. It's a <unk> of money.
I mean that these choices, <unk> and <unk>, is not that they're just <unk>.
I'm <unk> <unk>.
They do worse.
If a little bit of what our society <unk> <unk> was <unk> choice was <unk> in those where people have too few possibilities, it would not only be their life to <unk>, but also our <unk>.
This is what <unk> call.
One <unk> of the income is good at all -- not only the poor -- because of this choice in <unk> that we <unk>.
To end, "<unk>, you can become everything you want to --
<unk>, people of culture, <unk>, "What do you do that fish?"
"It's <unk> that you can't make anything in a <unk> of glass."
"A <unk>, a <unk> <unk> vision of the world --
and I <unk> it up like this, at the beginning.
But then, <unk>, instead, I realized that that the long knows that the long knows.
Because the reality of <unk> is that if you <unk> the <unk>, so that you can't do it all possible. "You don't <unk> the freedom.
If you <unk> the <unk> so that it's <unk> possible to <unk> the <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk>.
Everybody needs a <unk>.
