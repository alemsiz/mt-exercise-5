I showed these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, which for almost three million years, has the size of the <unk> <unk> <unk>, which for almost three million years, <unk> <unk> <unk>.
I'm going to <unk> this <unk> of the problem because it doesn't show the ice <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> is, in a certain sense, the heart of the <unk> of the climate system.
It's <unk> and <unk>.
The next <unk> will be a <unk> <unk> <unk> on the last 25 years.
The <unk> <unk> are <unk> in red.
As you see, you <unk> up to the blue <unk>.
That's the ice in <unk>, which <unk> in the summer.
You can see that the <unk> ice <unk>, of five years or more, it's like the blood, which here <unk> from the body.
In 25 years, it's been <unk> to this.
This is a problem because the <unk> <unk> <unk> the ground around the ocean ocean where there are enormous <unk> of <unk> that, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>,
<unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk>, that amount could <unk>, <unk> this point.
In some <unk> <unk> <unk> is already <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with a <unk> team <unk> <unk>. <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>! <unk>: You're good. <unk>: You're <unk>.
And the reason is that this <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> from the north.
This is a river in <unk> <unk>.
<unk> had never <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This is the <unk> <unk>, in the <unk> <unk>.
If you want to know how the <unk> <unk> <unk> on <unk>, here is where the <unk> <unk>.
These <unk> are <unk> <unk>.
<unk> other side of the planet: <unk>, the largest <unk> of ice on the planet.
The last month, the <unk> scientists that the <unk> of the ice is in <unk>, and that <unk> on some <unk> <unk>, is particularly <unk> in <unk>.
<unk> feet of the <unk>, like in <unk>.
<unk>, the third largest <unk> in ice, they see new <unk>, which a few years ago, they were <unk>.
<unk> percent of the world's population <unk> water from that <unk>.
<unk> <unk>: this <unk> is the water's <unk> of this town.
The <unk> is <unk>.
But when you <unk>, the same happens to the water.
<unk> <unk> <unk> is 40 percent.
The <unk> <unk> are in crisis.
<unk>, like you read, they're <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> in the world brings to a <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> are <unk> to a <unk> outside of the normal and <unk>.
<unk> times over the last 30 years of the <unk> <unk>.
This is a <unk> of the whole <unk>.
If you look at it in the context of the <unk> can see the <unk>.
In the last five years we have <unk> 70 million <unk> of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million <unk> in the ocean every day.
Look at the <unk> area, <unk>, from <unk>, to <unk>, and on both <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, where there is a <unk> <unk> of oxygen in the ocean.
The <unk> of global warming, together to the <unk>, which is 20 percent, is the use of <unk> <unk>.
The oil is a problem, and <unk> is even worse.
The United States is one of the most <unk> countries with China.
And they <unk> to build a lot of other <unk>.
But we're <unk> to a <unk> <unk>.
These are the projects <unk> over the last few years and some <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
And so, there's a <unk> <unk> in our country.
The <unk> and oil <unk> have <unk> million dollars in the last year to <unk> <unk> <unk>, which is a <unk>.
I <unk> image <unk> me --
<unk>, in <unk>, where I live, there was a <unk> of <unk> billion <unk> of <unk>.
Maybe you have seen it on the <unk>.
This is the second largest flow of <unk> in America.
It's happened around <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> of one of the <unk> <unk> was this.
<unk>: <unk> â™« <unk> <unk> is a <unk> <unk>, <unk> is a <unk> <unk> and happy.
It's <unk> here in America, and we grow our economy.
<unk> is <unk> more and more <unk>.
It's at good price, <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> here is most of the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The largest <unk> society on the <unk> is <unk> <unk>. This is his <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> <unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk> -- Al <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> -- they don't know what they're talking.
<unk>: So <unk> for the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This is one of them, one part.
<unk>: <unk>: <unk> <unk> we see <unk> changes as a <unk> <unk> to our business.
And so our <unk> is <unk> a big amount of money in a <unk> <unk> to make public public truth and <unk> the truth.
In fact, <unk> isn't <unk>.
We think it's <unk> -- it also <unk>.
So we don't know about climate change.
We're going to do.
<unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk> -- you know, you've heard a lot of it.
So I <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> for the <unk> <unk>.
<unk>! <unk> are a little <unk>, but this is the <unk> of the technology of <unk> <unk>.
<unk> is <unk> between the major <unk> of global warming, but the <unk> technology of <unk> that you see everything.
Let's look: this is the <unk> technology <unk>.
Al <unk>: <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to the economic <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> America is in crisis; the <unk> economy, national security crisis.
The <unk> that <unk> all: our <unk> from the <unk> <unk>, like <unk> <unk> and the oil <unk>.
But now, there's a new, <unk> solution to <unk>.
<unk> America: 100 percent of <unk> energy, in 10 years.
A plan to <unk> America to work, <unk> more <unk>, and help <unk> global warming.
<unk>, a solution that <unk> to solve our problems.
<unk> America. <unk> more.
Al <unk>: This is the last.
<unk>: It's about <unk> energy to America.
One of the most <unk> ways of <unk> <unk> <unk> our planet.
<unk>: The future is here. <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, a new <unk> network.
<unk> <unk> 2: <unk> <unk> for jobs <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> America. It's time to be <unk>.
<unk>: A old <unk> <unk> says, "If you want to go to alone.
If you want to go away, you go together. "
We have to go away, fast.
Thank you very much.
I did a <unk> on the <unk>.
And I try to <unk> it on how the car works.
So, here's. And for those who didn't have, the <unk> is the largest scientific experiment ever <unk> -- <unk> miles of <unk>.
<unk> is to <unk> the conditions that were <unk> less than a <unk> of a second from the beginning of the universe -- until <unk> million times a second.
All of that is just <unk>.
This is the <unk> machine.
<unk> these <unk> <unk> inside the <unk>.
This is what I work. It's called <unk> feet and it's <unk> feet and it's <unk> feet.
This is a <unk> picture of <unk> in building in the <unk>. You can see the <unk>.
<unk> last year we <unk> the car for the first time.
And this picture was <unk> by <unk>.
It was <unk> <unk> in the control <unk>.
It's an image of the first <unk> of particles that had done all the <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, with a part of the <unk>, and <unk> particles inside the <unk>.
In other words, when I <unk> that image the 10 <unk>, I <unk> that the car <unk>, which is a great <unk>.
I don't know if it was this to <unk> us more or this, when somebody <unk> on Google and <unk> that the page <unk> was this.
That means we've had a <unk> impact over to the scientific <unk>.
And I <unk> a week later, there was a problem with the car, it had to do this here -- these <unk> <unk>.
These <unk> <unk> <unk> when the car works at the <unk> of the <unk>.
Now, the <unk> between you of you <unk> the <unk> and <unk>, "It's not true. I'm <unk> too <unk>."
And they can do it because when they're very <unk> <unk> <unk>.
So, at least <unk> degrees, at a temperature <unk> to the <unk> of the space between the stars, these <unk> can bring that <unk>.
In one of the <unk> between the <unk> <unk>, there was a <unk> <unk>.
So the <unk> <unk> <unk>, and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a electric <unk>.
This was the result.
Now, this is even <unk> if you think that these <unk> <unk> <unk> over 20 <unk>, and that have <unk> about 30 <unk>.
They <unk> about 50 <unk>.
<unk>, what we then did.
We have <unk> and <unk>.
They're now <unk> everybody's <unk> to their <unk> place.
<unk> the end of <unk> the <unk> will be again.
We <unk> it, and we try to get some data to <unk> or <unk>, and continue the <unk>, and keep our <unk> to find out what the universe is.
Now, of course, in some way, these <unk> <unk> the <unk> of science and engineering engineering engineering engineering to <unk>. It's easy to <unk>.
I think the fact that's so hard, the fact of <unk>, I think that's the value of things like <unk>.
I'd like to end with the words of a <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, which, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, his <unk> was Michael <unk>, he said, "No <unk> <unk> <unk>, he said," No <unk> <unk> as the <unk> that the ideas of science are <unk>, that there are not <unk> in nature, that there are not <unk> in nature, that there are <unk>, and that we don't have <unk>. "
Thank you.
I want to start <unk> <unk> to when, from children, <unk> <unk>.
As we <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> to the way we're <unk> <unk> to the world.
So, from <unk> <unk> <unk> of our <unk> with <unk> objects, together with my <unk> <unk>, and my <unk> <unk> <unk>, I started <unk>, "And if we use a computer, instead of having the <unk> <unk> as the <unk> <unk> as <unk> as <unk> digital <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> an information with both of the hands of digital <unk>,
and we <unk> to our <unk>?
The question was so interesting that I decided to explore the answer, building <unk>.
In a few words, a <unk> is a <unk> computer <unk>.
In a few words, a <unk> is a <unk> computer <unk>.
You can <unk> them with the hand, they can <unk> them, and they can <unk> their movement and have a <unk> <unk>.
But <unk>, they're <unk> objects, like <unk>, you can just <unk>.
<unk> are the example of a new <unk> to <unk> the information to <unk> the digital information.
And as <unk> that become <unk>, <unk> of their <unk>, of their <unk>, and they become more <unk>, <unk> of their <unk>, <unk>, of their own movement, of the other, of how we <unk> them, we can explore new and <unk> <unk>.
I'll start with some simple example.
This <unk> is <unk> to show you about video: if you put it in a direction, the video <unk>, you'll get it back.
These <unk> are <unk> <unk>.
If you <unk> them, they <unk> to what they're going to be.
If they come <unk>, they can <unk> it and they can <unk> a little bit.
If they come <unk>, they can <unk> it and they can <unk> a little bit.
They also <unk> their movement and <unk>.
We then realized that one of the interesting <unk> was the <unk> that we could use <unk> <unk> on data, for example, "<unk> a color like it was a <unk>.
In this case, we have three <unk> <unk> as a <unk> <unk> and I can <unk> to <unk> <unk> to <unk> color in the central, where they <unk>.
and I can <unk> to <unk> the color in the central one where they <unk>.
If we're <unk> too much, we can <unk> a little bit of place.
There are also <unk> <unk> <unk>, like <unk>, <unk> and <unk> where people can try and <unk> where people can try and <unk> the results.
I'm --
This is a <unk> sequence that I do with a <unk> program.
Here we have a <unk> of words that's in the middle of <unk> and <unk>.
<unk>, at any <unk> <unk> a letter to <unk> on any <unk>, <unk>, every <unk>, <unk>, at any <unk>, and while I was <unk> <unk> <unk> on a <unk>.
Then, after about 30 seconds, you get <unk>, and you have a new chance to try.
Thank you.
Here's the kids <unk> in <unk> at the <unk> <unk>, I did <unk> them, and I <unk> a video.
They're very <unk>.
And one of the interesting things of <unk> is that you don't have to give people many <unk>.
You just say, "<unk> <unk> of words," and they know what to do.
Here's the other people who <unk> it.
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk>, there on the right.
It really wanted to <unk>.
They were just <unk>, for him.
Now, this is a <unk> of a <unk> <unk>.
We wanted to build a <unk> for the <unk> of the <unk>. He's <unk>.
It can <unk> new characters in the scene, <unk> their <unk>.
It can <unk> new characters in the scene, <unk> their <unk>.
Here's, it's <unk>.
<unk>: The sun is <unk>.
David <unk>: Now he took a <unk> in the scene.
<unk>: The <unk> <unk>.
<unk> work! Yes!
So <unk> the <unk> and <unk> can <unk> can <unk> the characters --
<unk>: <unk>!
-- <unk> your story.
<unk>: <unk>!
<unk>: It's a <unk> story, and it can decide him how they <unk>.
<unk>: It's a <unk> story, and it can decide him how they <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> <unk>.
<unk>: The last example I have time to show you is a tool, <unk>, and <unk> music.
It's a <unk>, <unk>, to <unk> and <unk> music.
The <unk> here are <unk> by <unk> like <unk>, <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> of these four <unk>, and you can choose what to use.
You can also <unk> these <unk> in a sequence of <unk> to your <unk>.
And they just <unk> a <unk>, and a <unk>.
These are the effects that you can control it from alive, like <unk> and <unk>.
We're going to <unk> it to a particular sound and then <unk> to <unk>.
And then there are <unk> effects like time and <unk>, <unk> to the entire sequence.
<unk> like it works.
<unk>: <unk>: <unk> <unk> a <unk> in two <unk>, "<unk> in a series, <unk> in a series, the <unk>, <unk>.
Now let's take a <unk> line.
<unk>: <unk>: Now I'm going to <unk> <unk> --
<unk>: And now I'm going to <unk> the <unk> to <unk>, so I can control the effect of the <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>: I can <unk> the entire <unk> <unk> time.
<unk>: And now we're going to <unk> the <unk> to give <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>: I can <unk> the <unk> <unk>.
So I don't have to <unk> before, but I can <unk> it, <unk> more or more <unk>.
And now, finally, I can <unk> the whole <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is to build new <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and more <unk> to how our brain work.
And today, I've had time to show you one of the results of this <unk>, and also some possibilities we try to bring out of the lab.
And the concept I want to <unk> is that's <unk> this new generation of <unk> objects to <unk> media, that we want to <unk> information in our world in the way we want.
Thank you very much.
I can't see the time to talk to you.
I'm a <unk>.
<unk> books is my <unk>, but it's more of course, of course.
It's also the love and the <unk> of my life.
And I don't look like that.
But, I said this, something particular happened in my life and my career, who <unk> me to <unk> the whole <unk> with this work.
The particular thing is I <unk> wrote this book, this <unk> called "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
And the result of the result of it is that everywhere <unk> now, people <unk> me as if I was <unk>.
<unk> -- <unk>, <unk>!
I'm going to go to me and they say, "You don't fear you don't want to be able to do it?
You don't have fear to write for the whole life without <unk> to be able to create a book that can <unk> to someone? "
that can <unk> to someone? "
It's <unk>, you know.
But it may be worse, <unk> me I remember the <unk> over 20 years ago, when I started to say to people -- I was a <unk> -- I wanted to be a <unk>.
I <unk> to the same <unk> <unk> by fear.
And people said, "Don't <unk>'t you know, I couldn't be able to success?
You don't have fear <unk> you?
You don't have fear this <unk> for all the life without anything that you have ever come out and die on a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>? "
So you know.
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is: "Yes."
Yeah, I'm afraid of all those things.
I always had fear.
And I also fear of many other things that people couldn't <unk>.
As <unk> and other things <unk>.
But, as it's about writing what I thought and <unk> <unk> is why?
Is it <unk>?
It's <unk> that anybody who who <unk> <unk> to be <unk> from a job that you hear.
But what is about so particular in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in a way that other <unk> don't do?
How did my father, for example, he was a <unk> <unk> and I didn't remember one time in his 40 years of activity where he asked if she was <unk> to be <unk>?
We never had -- that <unk> of the <unk> John, how do it?
Don't <unk>, <unk>?
<unk>, the engineers <unk> like no group of course, in <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We have <unk>, we have enough this <unk>, and not only <unk>, but <unk> of all of all kinds of <unk>, we have this <unk> of being <unk> <unk>.
And they didn't know that look at the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that, only in the <unk> century, young and often for them.
And even the ones that didn't seem to be really <unk> by their <unk>.
<unk>, before he died, in the last <unk> said, "" <unk>. My book <unk> me a little more <unk>. "He was a <unk> <unk> about work.
But we didn't know when we say this stuff is because we heard these things so long, we have <unk> and <unk> the <unk> that the <unk> of creativity and <unk> are in some <unk> and <unk> are <unk> in some way <unk> and that art, finally, <unk>, always <unk> to <unk>.
And the question I want to <unk> you to all over here today is: Do you agree with this idea?
It's OK, you're going to be <unk> by a <unk> distance to me, it doesn't work for anything that <unk>.
I think it's <unk>.
And I think it's also <unk> and I don't want to <unk> <unk> in the next century.
I think it's better <unk> our big <unk> to live.
And I certainly know that, in my case -- in my <unk> -- it would be very <unk> to start <unk> to that <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in which I'm in my career.
<unk> -- <unk> look, I'm pretty young, I have about 40 years.
I have about four <unk> of work in me.
And it's very <unk> that anything <unk> in time, then it will be <unk> by the world like the work that after the <unk> <unk> of my last book.
<unk>, because we're all <unk>, more or less friends here -- it's <unk> that my biggest success is to my <unk>.
Oh, <unk>, <unk>, that thought!
You know, you know, this is the kind of thought that brings a person to start <unk> at nine in the morning and I don't want to do it.
I'm going to continue to do this work.
So, the question becomes, how?
And so I think, after many <unk>, that the way to work to continue to write is the <unk> <unk>, right?
I have to have to find a distance of security between me, and my natural <unk> <unk> on what I'm <unk>, and my natural <unk> on what <unk> <unk>. And while I'm going to go through the time, looking through the time, looking at the time, looking at <unk> other society to have better ideas and more <unk>. If you have the best ideas and <unk>.
about how to help people <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity.
And the research <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
<unk> because they <unk> and then <unk> back.
<unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> -- people don't believe that creativity <unk> creativity <unk> from men, OK?
It <unk> that creativity was this <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> to the men from some <unk> and <unk>, for <unk> reasons <unk> and <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> these <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>.
<unk>, <unk>, <unk> to have a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> were the same idea, but they had the <unk> of the spirit without a <unk>.
And the <unk> is <unk>, because the <unk> didn't really know that a <unk> was somebody <unk>.
I thought a <unk> was this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and that <unk> <unk> literally in the <unk> of the study of a artist, a little bit like <unk>, and that <unk> out of <unk> the <unk>, and that <unk> out of the artist's work on.
<unk> <unk> <unk> you from the <unk>, the distance I talk -- that <unk> <unk> you from the results of your work.
And everybody <unk> that was so <unk>, <unk>?
So, the artists were <unk> to <unk> things, like, for example the too <unk>, isn't it?
If your work was <unk> <unk>, you didn't <unk> everything <unk>, everybody <unk> that <unk> state of <unk>.
If your work <unk>, it wasn't all your <unk>, right?
Everybody <unk> that was your <unk> to be a <unk>.
And so people <unk> <unk> <unk> creativity in <unk> for a long time.
Then the <unk> <unk> and everything <unk>, and we <unk> this big idea; we put the human being at the center of the universe over the universe and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and no longer <unk> space to <unk> from <unk>.
This was the <unk> principle and people <unk> to think that creativity <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And for the first time in the story, you <unk> to <unk> this or the artist as a rather <unk> to a <unk> <unk>.
And I have to <unk>, I think it was a big <unk>.
I think you're going to <unk> to someone, a simple person to believe that they're like a <unk> like a source, <unk> and <unk> of all the <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> and <unk> it's a <unk> <unk>.
It's like to someone to <unk> the sun.
<unk> and <unk> completely <unk> the <unk> and <unk> all these <unk> <unk> on the <unk>.
And I think it was this pressure to have <unk> artists in the <unk> 500 years.
And, if this is true, and I think it's, the question of it, the question of it, and the question?
Can we <unk> it?
We're going to go back to a more <unk> understanding of the relationship between humans and <unk> <unk>.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we can't <unk> 500 years of thinking in a 18 minutes.
And there are probably people in the audience who <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on their <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, you know, <unk> people <unk> <unk> <unk> on their projects.
You probably don't <unk> you all about this.
But the question I'd like to <unk> is -- why not?
Why don't you <unk> this way?
Because it's more sense of everything I've ever heard about to explain the <unk> <unk> process.
A process that, as anybody ever <unk> to do something -- so, we're all here -- know, you don't know <unk>.
And in fact, it can be completely <unk>.
I've done this <unk> <unk> with the extraordinary <unk> <unk>, who has now 90 years old, but it was a <unk> for all life and said that during his <unk> in the <unk> <unk>, <unk> out in the <unk> <unk>, <unk> out of the <unk>.
He said, he was like a <unk> <unk>.
And he <unk> <unk> to her from the <unk>.
We <unk> it to come, because he was <unk> the land under his feet.
I decided to have one thing to do at that point and was, he said, "<unk> like a <unk>."
And he <unk> back to the home and he was <unk> from this <unk>, and he didn't have to do anything that take a piece of paper and a <unk> <unk> <unk> on the page.
<unk> times not <unk> to be <unk>, so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and she would <unk> the <unk> and she would <unk> through the <unk>, looking for, like she said, "another <unk>."
And then there were the time -- this <unk> never -- there were some moments where it was <unk>, OK?
So, he was <unk> at home and he was looking at home and the <unk> through the <unk> through, and he <unk> a <unk> right in the while he was <unk> with the other hand and <unk>.
<unk> the <unk> from the tail and the <unk> in his body and the <unk> on the page.
And in these cases, the <unk> would <unk> to the page and <unk>, but the <unk> word to the first word in the first word.
So when I <unk> <unk> -- it's <unk>, it's exactly <unk> to my <unk> process.
Not a <unk> process -- I'm not a <unk>!
I'm a <unk>, and my way of <unk> is; I'm <unk> at the same <unk> every day and work on it.
But even I have, in my <unk>, I <unk> against that thing, sometimes.
And I think that many of you the <unk> <unk>.
You know, even if the work and ideas <unk> me <unk> from a certain source I couldn't <unk>.
And what is what is this?
And how can we <unk> it to it not <unk> your mind, but rather, what do you <unk> <unk>?
As I'm <unk>, the best example I have is the <unk> <unk> <unk>, which I've <unk> several years ago for a <unk>.
And you're talking about this, and you know, <unk>, for the <unk> of life has been the <unk> artist's <unk>, trying to control, <unk> these <unk> <unk>, <unk> these <unk> <unk>.
But then <unk>, he <unk>, and one day while he was <unk> on a <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> everything.
<unk> <unk> and everything of a <unk> <unk> this little <unk> of <unk>, <unk> this little <unk> of <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, and <unk>, and you want, you know, it's wonderful, and <unk>, but it doesn't know how to <unk>.
It's not a paper, it doesn't have a <unk>, he didn't have a <unk>.
So it starts to feel this kind of old <unk> to <unk> in him, "I'm going to lose, and I'm going to <unk>, and I'm going to <unk> this <unk> song.
I'm not <unk> enough and I can't <unk>. "
And instead of going to go to the <unk>, they <unk>.
<unk> the whole process of <unk> and <unk> something completely new.
He just <unk> the sky and said, "<unk>, you see I'm <unk>?"
"Do you think you can write a song now?
If you really want to <unk>, you'll <unk> it in a more <unk> moment when I can take care of.
<unk>, <unk> to <unk> <unk> more.
We started <unk> <unk> <unk>. "
And his process <unk> <unk> after this.
Not the work, it's still <unk>.
But the process, and the <unk> <unk> that <unk> was <unk> when <unk> the <unk>, the <unk> that out of him <unk> <unk>, <unk> that <unk> didn't have to be a <unk> thing that <unk> <unk> <unk>.
but I <unk> this <unk>, <unk> <unk> a conversation between <unk> and this <unk> thing that <unk> and <unk> <unk>, but it wasn't <unk>.
So how I <unk> that story is <unk> to change a little bit of a way I <unk> and already <unk> me once.
This idea, I <unk> when I was <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and I <unk> it in one of the <unk> where we're all working on something and you can't have and you can't think it's going to be a <unk>, that's going to be the <unk> book.
Not just <unk>, just <unk> book.
And I started to think about <unk> this project.
But then I <unk> to <unk> that <unk> and <unk>.
So I <unk> my face on the <unk> and <unk> my <unk> to a <unk> corner of the room.
And I said <unk>, "<unk>, what, we know, both, we know that if this book is not going to be <unk>, no?
Because as you see, I'm <unk> everything I have, I don't have to do this.
So if you want it to be better, you have to <unk> and do.
OK. But if you don't do it, you know what, you don't know anything.
I started writing the same because it's my work.
And I'd like to say, I'm <unk> that I've been <unk> to do my part. "Because -- finally, OK -- <unk>, <unk> in the <unk> Africa of the moon, <unk>, <unk> music that <unk> <unk>, <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
And they were always <unk>, because the <unk> were <unk> and they were <unk>.
But every single one of these <unk>, <unk>, and one of these <unk> artists actually <unk>.
And I know what I talk about, because I know you have seen all of them, at some point, a <unk> <unk> like this.
It was like the time <unk>, and the <unk> <unk> through a kind of <unk> and he wasn't doing anything different from the usually, like <unk> <unk> before, but everything <unk>.
And suddenly not <unk> <unk>, just like a human.
But it <unk> from the <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> fire.
And when this <unk>, people <unk> what was, he <unk> it with her name.
<unk> your hands and <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, God," God, "God," God, "God,"
That's God, you know.
<unk> <unk> -- when the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> this <unk> with them and the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>,
In <unk>, when a artist has done something impossible and <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> -- a <unk> of God.
And it's <unk> because we need.
But the problem is coming up the day after, for <unk> itself, when they <unk> and <unk> that are the <unk> 11 <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
It's just a <unk> <unk> <unk>, and maybe I never <unk> to <unk> that <unk>.
And maybe nobody <unk> the name of God still <unk>, and so it must do with the rest of his life?
It's hard.
This is one of the most <unk> <unk> to do in a <unk> life.
But maybe it doesn't have to be so <unk> if you can't believe, <unk>, <unk>, that the most <unk> <unk> of your being from yourself.
But let me just <unk> you have data in <unk> from a source of this <unk> part of your life that you have to <unk> somebody else when you're finished.
And, you know, if we think of this way changes everything.
And so I started <unk>, and it's <unk> like I <unk> for several months during the <unk>'s book that I was soon <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>
And what I have to continue to <unk> when I feel that is, I'm not afraid.
Don't <unk>. <unk> just your work.
You can <unk> for your side, any of any <unk> can be.
If your work is <unk>, <unk>.
If the <unk>, you will <unk> to you <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> some kind of <unk>, for one moment through your <unk>, you know, you know! "
You know, you're <unk> your <unk>.
And I'm <unk>! "<unk> it."
I think it's <unk> <unk>.
"<unk>!" <unk>! "<unk> it, even for <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>."
Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk>: <unk>!
As you know, I talked about some of these projects on the human genome, what it can <unk> and the discovery of new <unk> genes.
We're now <unk> a new <unk>: we started <unk> biology and now starting to <unk> biology and now <unk> from that digital code, we're <unk> in a new <unk> of biology, <unk> and <unk> life.
We always tried to <unk> big questions.
What is life? "It's something that many <unk> have <unk> to understand how many <unk> have <unk> to understand how many <unk> have <unk>.
We tried to <unk>, <unk> to <unk> <unk>.
We're <unk> for about 20 years.
When we <unk> the human genome <unk> <unk> from <unk> world of biology to <unk> from the world of biology.
Now, we can <unk> life, or create new life from this digital universe?
This is the map of a little <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, which is the species from the <unk> genome between those that can <unk> in the lab.
And we tried to reduce <unk> the genome to <unk> one even smaller.
We're able to <unk> a <unk> of the <unk> about 500 that are here.
But when we take a look at his <unk> map, it's <unk> simple than our.
<unk>, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can <unk>, once at the time, it's very <unk> that can bring to a <unk> cell.
So I thought the only <unk> to <unk> was <unk> this <unk> to <unk> the <unk> to <unk> some of these questions.
And so we started the <unk> of the <unk>. We can <unk> a <unk>? "
Can the chemistry <unk> of produce these big molecules that we never have <unk> to create before we've ever <unk>?
And in case, what <unk>, can we make a <unk>?
A <unk> is just a <unk> of <unk> material.
The speed we're able to <unk> life is <unk> to <unk> <unk>.
Our <unk> to write the <unk> code, instead, <unk> rather slowly, but it's <unk>.
And our <unk> results <unk> <unk> on a <unk> <unk>.
We've <unk> over 15 years ago.
The process has <unk> a lot of <unk>, <unk> with a <unk> <unk> before the early experiments.
But we found that <unk> DNA is very difficult.
There are <unk> of thousands of cars in the world that <unk> little <unk> of DNA, of <unk> 30 to 50 <unk> and it's a <unk> process. The <unk> is a <unk> process: the more <unk> is <unk>.
So we had to develop a new <unk> to <unk> these <unk> and <unk> the <unk>.
And this was our first <unk>, <unk> from information digital information genome of <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's a little <unk> that <unk> bacteria.
We have the <unk>, <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> a DNA <unk> of about <unk> <unk>.
The interesting part is when we took this piece of <unk> material <unk> and we <unk> it in the bacteria, the bacteria have <unk> to read this code and <unk> the <unk> particles.
<unk> have <unk> <unk>.
I talked about recently with the <unk> <unk> <unk> who have <unk> <unk> this model.
They have <unk> more of you.
And I think this is a situation where software can actually build its own <unk> in a <unk> system.
But we could do the biggest things in the world.
We wanted to build the entire <unk> of the <unk>.
They are more than <unk> <unk> <unk>.
So we thought of <unk> in the size of the virus, so that we can change the <unk> of a <unk> cell.
The <unk> is <unk>, and if you <unk> information information in a computer, they have to be very <unk>.
When I <unk> this genome for the first time in <unk> the standard <unk> was a <unk> for every 10 <unk> <unk>.
We found, <unk>, 30 <unk>. If we used that <unk> <unk> <unk>. If we used that <unk> <unk> <unk>.
One part of the process is design <unk> 50 <unk> that <unk> all the other <unk> 50 <unk> to build smaller <unk> <unk> to build smaller smaller <unk> <unk>.
<unk> elements here.
You probably read that <unk> us about <unk>.
<unk> <unk>: We have a <unk> <unk> <unk> on four <unk>: A, <unk>, <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, about 20 <unk>, and there's a <unk> order of <unk> for each <unk>.
So we can use the <unk> code to write words, <unk>, <unk>.
What we did at the beginning was <unk>.
Some of them have been <unk> by the fact that it wasn't <unk>.
We have designed these <unk> to <unk> simply <unk> with <unk>.
There are <unk> that <unk> them and <unk> them.
And we started <unk> of the parts, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
In every step we have produced these <unk> in <unk> so that we're <unk> <unk>, because we're going to create a very <unk> <unk> <unk> as you see in a minute.
We're trying to <unk> the process.
So this looks like the <unk> of a <unk> <unk>.
When we go to these very <unk>, I'm <unk> more than 100 <unk>, you don't get <unk> directly in the <unk> <unk>.
You get to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> biology.
So we have <unk> other <unk>.
<unk> of another <unk> called <unk> <unk>, which in biology <unk> to <unk> DNA <unk> to <unk> the DNA to <unk> the <unk>.
So here's an example.
This <unk>, called <unk> <unk>, can <unk> three million <unk> of <unk>.
You can see in the <unk> <unk> as his <unk> <unk> is <unk>.
In 12 hours, it's <unk> exactly how it was before.
<unk> thousands of organisms that are able to do that.
These organisms can <unk> completely.
We need to live under <unk>.
They're absolutely sure life <unk> in space, and they <unk> to find new <unk> <unk>.
In fact, NASA showed that this is going on.
This is an image of the <unk> that we've built using these <unk>, just by <unk> with the <unk> design of the <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This is not <unk> with a <unk> <unk>, but with a <unk> <unk>.
It's a <unk> <unk> that we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk>.
These are pictures that <unk> a period of about six seconds.
This is the <unk> that we've done a little time ago.
They are more than <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's the largest <unk> of a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It has a <unk> weight to 300 million.
If you <unk> it with a <unk> 10, you just <unk> pages to <unk> this code.
Now, how do we make it work? How can we <unk>?
Of course, with a virus is a <unk>.
It's a little <unk> when you use bacteria.
It's <unk>, even when it's about <unk> cells, like, you just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> another, which is <unk> process.
In <unk>, we <unk> the <unk> is instead <unk> inside the cell, but we have <unk> <unk> that we are able to do a <unk> <unk> of a <unk> from a <unk> cell to another and <unk>.
We <unk> a <unk> <unk> from a <unk> species.
<unk> are the two different <unk> of the <unk>.
We've <unk> some <unk> in a <unk> <unk> that we can decide which to choose to this <unk>.
And then he <unk> it with the <unk> <unk> all the <unk>.
And when we put it in the cell was <unk> and <unk> our <unk> the new <unk> went inside the new <unk>.
And <unk> <unk> that didn't <unk> go beyond, but we tried to <unk> more in there.
This is one of the major <unk> of evolution.
We found that <unk> species have <unk> a second or a third <unk> somewhere, <unk> in a second thousands of new <unk> to that species.
So the <unk> thinks about as a only <unk> at the time that <unk> didn't <unk> a lot of biology.
<unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> that was in the cell didn't <unk> one.
The <unk> <unk> we have <unk>.
It <unk>, and he <unk> the other <unk> like <unk> material, <unk> it, and we <unk> it, it <unk>, and we <unk> it.
It's become blue because of the genes we have <unk>.
And in a short time, all the <unk> of a species are <unk> <unk>, and it <unk> of the whole new software that we <unk> in a new species, <unk> on the new software that we <unk> in the cell.
All the <unk> are <unk>, the <unk> are <unk>, and when you <unk> the code that we have <unk>.
Now, this may seem <unk> <unk>, but we <unk> the software, we can change things in a <unk> <unk>.
Now, I've already <unk> that you don't talk about <unk> -- but of progress at three million years and a half million years of evolution, and I said that we're going to create a new version of the <unk> <unk> that we're going to create a new species on this digital process.
Why do that?
I think it's pretty <unk> when we think of our <unk>.
We're going to go from six and a half billion people to <unk> billion over the next 40 years.
Right to give you an example: I was born in <unk>.
Now, there are three people on the planet to <unk> in <unk>; in 40 years, there will be four.
We're <unk> problems now to find food, <unk> and <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, <unk> and <unk> for six billion people.
We're even <unk> to do it for nine billion.
<unk> than five billion <unk>, over 30 billion <unk> billion <unk>.
That means 100 million <unk> a day.
When we try to find <unk> <unk>, or any kind of process to <unk>, it will be a huge challenge.
We have to realize that all the <unk> of CO2 from these materials that <unk> in the atmosphere.
In the day, <unk> to the <unk> <unk> around the world, we have a <unk> with about 20 million genes, and I like to think that are the <unk> <unk> for the future.
The <unk> industry only only one <unk> about <unk>, and think about how many different things are <unk> out.
Our <unk> here are <unk> data from the reality <unk> and our imagination.
We have <unk>, <unk> to these <unk> <unk> <unk>, to <unk>, to create what we call <unk> <unk>.
We're able to build a big robot that can produce a million <unk> a day.
Think of <unk> these 20 million genes or try to <unk> the <unk> to make <unk> or <unk>, new <unk>, we can change, with a little team, and create more <unk> biology now that in the last 20 years of science.
And it's just a standard <unk>.
We can choose to <unk> <unk>, chemistry or <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This is a <unk> of some software <unk> software we're working on to be able to <unk> and <unk> species to computers.
Well, we don't know how they're going to be.
We know exactly how their <unk> code.
We're now <unk> on the <unk> of <unk>.
You've seen that <unk> <unk> from the <unk> was an experiment.
We've <unk> <unk>, <unk>, and third generation that <unk> soon as <unk> as <unk> or different kinds of <unk>.
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the <unk> would be <unk> CO2 in matter before we're working on to design cells that can reach that <unk> to be <unk> <unk> in about 18 months.
<unk> <unk> with CO2 is a <unk>, but in our <unk>, in our <unk> around the world, we've found <unk>.
This is a <unk> that we have <unk> in <unk>.
<unk> feet of the deep ocean, at about <unk> feet of <unk>.
They're <unk> by CO2 using hydrogen <unk> as much as the source of energy.
We're trying to understand if we can <unk> CO2, that can easily be <unk> by <unk>, <unk> that can easily be <unk> by <unk>, to drive this process.
So we think of short, we think we might be able to <unk> what the basic question, "which is," we, we have the <unk> goal of <unk> the entire <unk> industry.
<unk>. If you can't do that from TED, where you can't?
We have a main source of energy.
<unk>, we're working on the same <unk> to create <unk> <unk>.
You've seen this year with flu, we're always back a year and with a dollar in less when it's about <unk>.
I think what you can change building <unk> <unk> in <unk>.
That's how the future may be <unk>, now, the tree of evolution, <unk> the tree with bacteria, <unk>, <unk> cells.
We are <unk> to <unk> people.
Our purpose is to make a long time to live enough to try to <unk> <unk>. Thank you very much.
I'll show you, the <unk> of all, the <unk> possible possible, some <unk> work, the <unk>, the <unk>, a <unk> <unk> to a <unk> <unk>. It's <unk>.
It's a environment where you can <unk> is at local level of the <unk> data.
We're seeing <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> with a kind of <unk> <unk> and <unk>, for a fast <unk>, <unk> the images like we want.
And it doesn't matter how big the amount of information we see, how big these <unk> are these <unk> of data or the images.
Most of them are <unk> photographs, but this is a <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of the <unk>, and <unk> in the <unk> of 300 <unk>.
It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that <unk> the <unk> of a system like this is the number of <unk> on your screen at any time. It's also a very <unk> architecture.
This is a whole book, example of data not images.
This is the <unk> <unk>. Every <unk> <unk> a <unk>.
And so, to <unk> that's not about images, we can do something of that kind of, to make it really <unk>.
It may be a little <unk> to read a book.
I'm not going to <unk> it.
This is an <unk> example. This is a <unk> number of <unk>.
Every picture is the beginning of a <unk>.
And it gives you a really pleasure and the beautiful experience of the real <unk> version of a <unk>, which is for nature of a <unk>, which is for nature, a <unk> kind of a <unk>.
We also did something with the corner of this particular number of <unk>.
We've created a <unk> <unk> much than the one is using in a normal <unk> <unk> and we have <unk> <unk> content.
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk>, you can see here.
Or some <unk>, or even the <unk> <unk>.
And this really <unk> some of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of space on the screen.
And I thought this <unk> would <unk> to <unk> and other <unk> <unk>, not to be <unk>.
Of course, the <unk> is one of the most <unk> <unk> for this kind of technology.
And on this one I don't want to lose time, if not to say we have <unk> to <unk> from <unk> to <unk> in this field.
These are all the streets in the United States <unk> over a NASA <unk>.
So now I'm going to do something else.
This is actually live on the web; you can see it.
It's a project called <unk>, which <unk> two different <unk> technologies.
One is <unk> and the other is a <unk> <unk> computer computer <unk> <unk>, a <unk> student of Washington, with the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And it's alive in the web, <unk>.
You can see when we do this kind of <unk>, where we can go from an image to the other one and have this kind of experience to <unk> <unk>.
But the <unk> <unk> of the images here actually actually have a meaning.
The <unk> of the <unk> have <unk> these images together, so that <unk> to the <unk> places that <unk> all <unk> <unk> up <unk> <unk> <unk> have been <unk>. <unk> <unk> have been <unk>. And you see the elements of a <unk> or <unk>, and these things are all <unk> on on the <unk> <unk>, and these things have all <unk> on on the level <unk> level.
I don't know if I have time to show you some other environment.
There are much <unk>.
I want to go directly to one of the <unk> of <unk> data and this <unk> from a <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> that we've done for the first time, I'll show you what we're going to be the key behind this technology, the technology, <unk>. And it's not <unk> as much as <unk> <unk>. And it's not <unk> as much <unk>.
We had to <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk>.
This is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> images from <unk>. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> images of kinds of <unk> and <unk> and <unk> of the kind of <unk> and <unk> and <unk>. And you know, this is a picture that's discovery.
So, I'm all <unk> images and have been all <unk> on the <unk> level in this way.
And it's possible to <unk> this <unk> way.
You know, I never thought of work for <unk>.
It's very <unk> <unk> this kind of <unk> here.
I think you can see that it's a lot of different kinds of <unk>: from those <unk> to <unk> <unk>, a number, <unk> in this environment.
And if I can, I can <unk> to find the <unk>.
Many are <unk> <unk>, etc.
<unk> here is a series of photographs -- <unk>.
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We can go from the <unk> to the physics of this environment.
The <unk> point is that we can do things with social environment. This is now <unk> data from <unk> from the entire memory of how we <unk> the land, from the perspective of how we <unk> the land, from the perspective of <unk> and <unk> all of that data together.
All of those pictures become <unk>, more than the <unk>.
You have a model of the land that you <unk>.
Think about this as the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> on Earth <unk>.
It's something that <unk> in <unk> of <unk> <unk>, and the <unk> that you're <unk> with <unk> <unk> with <unk>.
They have <unk> with <unk> <unk> from other people.
If someone gets the idea of <unk> all these <unk> <unk> the name, my picture of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> all of the data, and I can use as a <unk> point to <unk> in that space, in that <unk>, using the pictures of everyone else, and have a social experience of <unk>.
Of course, a <unk> of all of that are <unk> <unk> <unk> of every interesting part of the land, <unk> not only by <unk> <unk> and images and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk>.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I realized? What's good? What your software <unk> software will <unk> us to do is that at some point, in the next few years, all the <unk> <unk>. <unk> will be <unk> together?
<unk>: Yes. What's doing is basically <unk>.
It's <unk> of the <unk>, if you want, between images.
And it's doing it in the <unk> of images.
The thing becomes very interesting if you think of the <unk> information information that many of these <unk> images.
As you do a research images on the web, you <unk> a <unk> and the page on the page page has a lot of information about images.
Now, what happens if that picture <unk> all your picture?
So the amount of <unk> <unk> and the amount of <unk> <unk> that <unk> is really enormous. It's a <unk> <unk>.
CA: <unk>, it's really amazing. <unk>.
<unk>: I'm going to <unk> you very.
One of the major <unk> when they <unk> and one of the <unk> research is that we can live between who didn't <unk> the <unk> <unk>, between who <unk> the past in the wind, the <unk> <unk> it in the <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk> it in the <unk> of plants.
You think that <unk> <unk> <unk> still <unk> over the <unk> <unk>, or the <unk> <unk> <unk> are still <unk> <unk> <unk>, or <unk>, the <unk> <unk> still <unk> the <unk> of <unk>, and the idea that the world the idea that the world that the idea that the world where we live in in <unk> sense, but it's just a <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk>, and that the idea that the world we don't have in the <unk> <unk> <unk>,
the <unk> of a particular <unk> of <unk> choices that our <unk> has done, <unk> or evil, many <unk>, many <unk> ago.
And of course, all of the <unk> <unk>.
Everybody <unk>. <unk>.
We're <unk> to <unk>.
We have to <unk> the <unk> of death <unk>, so we don't <unk> if we <unk> and <unk> --
We all have a art.
What <unk> is the <unk> <unk> of the song, the <unk> of every culture.
It doesn't matter that it's the <unk> of the <unk>, or the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, or the <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk>, <unk>, or a <unk> in the <unk>.
He was my <unk> of a <unk> trip in the <unk> a month ago, or a <unk> <unk> in the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk> mother's <unk>.
All of these <unk> <unk> us that there are other ways of <unk> other ways of thinking, other ways to move in the world.
And if you <unk> a moment, it's a concept that can give you hope.
<unk>, the <unk> of the world create a <unk> of life and <unk> that <unk> the planet and <unk> the planet, and it's important for the <unk> of the planet as the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And you can think of this <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and you can <unk> the <unk> of all the <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> in being by the human imagination.
The <unk> is the <unk> of humanity.
It's the <unk> of what we are and what we can be as as <unk> species.
And <unk> the <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk>, for example, <unk> that 50 percent of all the species has been or <unk> on the <unk> of <unk> simply because it's <unk>, or in the most <unk> -- in the <unk> of <unk> diversity -- and you don't even <unk> to the <unk> <unk> -- the <unk> of the diversity of <unk>.
The <unk> of all of that is, of course, <unk> <unk>.
When you're <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on this planet.
A <unk> is not just <unk> from a <unk> or a series of rules.
One is the <unk> of the human spirit.
It's the middle of the culture that the <unk> of every culture is coming in in the material world.
<unk> is a forest of the mind, a <unk>, a <unk>, a <unk> of <unk>.
And of the <unk> <unk>, while we're here in <unk>, at least half isn't <unk> in the <unk> of children.
They're not <unk> to kids, which means, unless you do something, which is <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
What's most <unk> of the <unk> to be <unk> by the <unk>, of being the last to talk to a language, not to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of the children?
This <unk> <unk> was the state of somebody in the world every two weeks. every two weeks: every two weeks, a <unk> <unk> and <unk> it in the <unk> <unk> of a <unk> language.
And I know that some of you say, "Don't it?
The world would not be a better place if we all have the same language? "<unk>, then we all <unk>.
<unk> <unk>.
<unk> of a <unk> thing is to say, "You can't talk about their language.
And I'd like to give you a journey through the <unk> --
a little journey in the <unk> to give you a <unk> of what we're <unk>.
Many of us <unk> that when I say, "different ways of <unk>," I mean, "I really mean very different ways of <unk>.
<unk> for example this <unk> <unk>, in <unk>, the <unk> of the <unk>, which <unk> to the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's a <unk> that it's not <unk> the blue color from the <unk> because the <unk> is <unk> in the forest, that we <unk> the <unk>.
They have a <unk> language and a <unk> rule, <unk> <unk>, "You have to <unk> a different <unk>.
All of that has <unk> in the past <unk>, but the <unk> is that these families in which you are talking about six or seven <unk> because of the <unk> <unk>.
You're <unk> to listen and then you're going to talk to.
I <unk> one of the most interesting <unk> <unk>, which I lived in, the <unk> <unk> <unk>, an amazing <unk> <unk> that had the first <unk> in <unk>.
In the <unk> five <unk> have <unk> a <unk> <unk>.
They <unk> from the high photographs that <unk> them in <unk> <unk>, <unk> that this <unk> forest <unk> never had seen anything <unk>.
They <unk> the <unk> <unk>, they <unk> the <unk> <unk>.
But the <unk> didn't just <unk> <unk>.
They <unk> between them.
<unk> percent of the <unk> was <unk> by their own.
We're <unk> to eight <unk> and we found two <unk> cases and we found two <unk>, they <unk> that one of them was <unk> so that she died, and then they <unk> it.
The <unk> were able to recognize the animal <unk> from 40 <unk> and <unk> the species.
In the early <unk>, I was <unk> a very interesting <unk> when my <unk> <unk> <unk>, I was <unk> if I wanted to go to <unk> between the <unk> <unk> and <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk>
To give sense of <unk>, I should have understanding the <unk> culture and the <unk> is not <unk> <unk>.
It's pretty much of a <unk> view of the world.
<unk> <unk>.
If you try to <unk> the <unk> of the world, what would you <unk>?
<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, etc.
A continent is always <unk> out, thinking that Africa doesn't have <unk> <unk>. And instead, yes, and the <unk> is not anything else that the <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk>.
What makes the <unk> is the <unk> <unk> between life and death.
So <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> can be <unk> by the <unk> <unk>, <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> <unk> it to the <unk>.
And so, we say, "<unk> <unk> <unk> go to <unk> to talk about God.
We <unk> in <unk> and <unk> God. "
And the moment you're <unk>, is the spirit that <unk> you, how can you make it <unk>?
So, you <unk> to these incredible events: <unk> <unk> in the state of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a rather <unk> of the power of the mind when it's <unk> in a state of <unk> <unk>.
<unk> all the <unk> <unk> that I lived the most <unk> are the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> of the <unk> civilization <unk> that once <unk> on the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
In a <unk> continent of blood continent, this <unk> never <unk> by <unk>.
In <unk>, I'm <unk> by a <unk>, but they <unk> is extraordinary.
The young people are <unk> from <unk> to three or four years, and they live in a world <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> to <unk> the basic <unk> for 18 years.
Two <unk> of nine years <unk> <unk> <unk>.
For all this time, they come to the values of their society, values that <unk> their <unk> and only their <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or to say the <unk> <unk>.
And the <unk> of this incredible <unk>, they come out and the first time in their life, at the age of 18 years, see a <unk>. And in that moment of the first <unk>, when the sun <unk> the <unk> of the <unk>, everything they have learned in the <unk> theory, everything they have learned in the <unk> theory in the <unk>. <unk> does a <unk> <unk>. And he says,
"<unk>? I'm going to <unk> you.
It's <unk>. Now it's <unk> to you <unk>. "
They call <unk> <unk> and they say that we, <unk> <unk>, we are the <unk> of the world.
This is extremely important.
When we think of the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> environment and the <unk> <unk> <unk> and the old story of the <unk> <unk>, that's a <unk> concept in his <unk> or maybe <unk> and we say that these <unk> are <unk> to the Earth.
The <unk> <unk> are not <unk> or <unk> from the <unk>.
There's no space for these things in the <unk> <unk> or in the <unk> <unk>, but <unk>, created a <unk> of the Earth <unk> <unk> not on the Earth of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. But it's a <unk> <unk> <unk>, the <unk> of the Earth can only live because it because it's <unk> by human <unk>.
What does it mean?
I mean that a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> that <unk> is a <unk> <unk> <unk> to be <unk> <unk>. And it will <unk> a human being <unk> different, and it will have a <unk> different <unk>, and it will have a <unk> <unk> that <unk> is a mountain of <unk> to be <unk>.
That's the <unk> of a spirit or a <unk> <unk> is <unk>.
What's interesting is the <unk> that <unk> the relationship between the <unk> and the natural world.
I grew up in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to be <unk>.
And that made me a human being different than my friends who believe that <unk> are the <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> that live in the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> that live in the <unk> <unk>.
If you start <unk> that these <unk> can create reality, <unk> to start understanding some of their <unk>. <unk> this <unk>.
I <unk> this picture in the <unk> <unk>.
Maybe some of you have heard about <unk>, the most powerful <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk>.
What makes the <unk> is not the potential <unk> is not the potential of the <unk>, but its <unk>. It's <unk> by two elements.
On one side, this <unk> <unk> <unk> that has a series of <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
<unk> the only <unk> has a <unk> <unk> that <unk> a little bit of the <unk>, but it's <unk> with the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> family <unk> said.
This <unk> <unk> <unk>, very similar to <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
If you're going to see the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> that make a different <unk> of the species, <unk> it.
<unk> that <unk> on the <unk> is a little bit of like being <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a sea of electricity. <unk>. It doesn't create the <unk> of the reality of reality.
I often <unk> with my <unk>, Richard <unk> <unk>, the man who <unk> the <unk> was <unk>, with his discovery of the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>.
<unk> my <unk> <unk> you can't <unk> these <unk> as <unk> because if you're <unk>, you can't tell anybody to be <unk>. <unk>. But they can't be <unk> because they're <unk>, but they're <unk> by a <unk> that's <unk> in the <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
It's possible to <unk> only if you can <unk> with other <unk> <unk> that <unk> the <unk>.
Now the <unk> is the <unk> that are in this <unk> are <unk>, of the <unk> that are <unk>, the same <unk> to <unk> the <unk>. The question <unk> <unk>: in a <unk> of <unk> species of plants, how these <unk> <unk> two <unk> not <unk>, but that if you <unk> in this way, they create a <unk> <unk> <unk>. But if you're <unk> in this way, they create a <unk> version of the <unk>.
We use the great <unk> of <unk> and <unk>, which can <unk> <unk>.
But if you go to the <unk>, we <unk> us. "
What does it mean?
This <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> in the forest, and our eyes <unk> in the forest itself species.
If <unk> how they <unk> their <unk> <unk> us, "<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>." <unk> <unk>.
The solution is: you take the <unk> <unk> in a night of moon and <unk> with a different <unk>.
And you don't <unk> to <unk>, but it's much more interesting than <unk> <unk>.
Now, the <unk> is that the problem is that even the ones of us who have <unk> <unk> them, but somehow <unk> to the <unk> of the history of respect to our world world, and it's <unk>.
In fact, the <unk> century, in 300 years, not <unk> <unk> for his <unk> or his <unk> <unk>, but rather like the <unk> was where we <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> diversity and <unk> of the planet. Now the problem is not the change.
All the <unk> are <unk> in a <unk> for new <unk>.
And the problem is not technology.
<unk> didn't <unk> to be <unk> when they put <unk> and <unk> as much as the <unk> have not <unk> to be <unk> when they put <unk> and <unk>.
It's not the change or technology that <unk> the <unk> of the <unk>. It's the power.
The <unk> <unk>.
And if you look at the world, I'm not <unk> <unk> to <unk>.
They are <unk> and <unk> <unk> out of the <unk> forces that go beyond their <unk> forces that go beyond their <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> --
a <unk> <unk> <unk>, in <unk>, <unk>, a <unk> that has <unk> <unk> in the forest to a generation ago, and now <unk> to the <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk>, where you can see the <unk> <unk> from the <unk> that looks <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk>,
We started <unk> <unk> with the <unk> <unk> <unk> to the forest.
Or in the <unk>, they're the <unk> <unk>, are the <unk> <unk> with the <unk> discovery.
If you take on the <unk> of the <unk>, where I'm doing a lot of research, you'll see the <unk> <unk> of politics.
As <unk>, the <unk> physics of a <unk>, it's <unk> at the <unk>, but the <unk>, the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of a <unk>, not only it's not <unk>, but <unk> in certain <unk>, because it's part of <unk>.
And you can't understand the <unk> of the <unk> until you don't go from the beginning.
I got the <unk> miles from <unk> in the <unk> China through the <unk> <unk>, <unk> to <unk> with a young <unk>, but only <unk> to <unk>. I realized what's behind the <unk> we're going to talk about.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> million people <unk> from <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk>.
The father of this guy was <unk> to the <unk> <unk>.
And the <unk> that means that it was <unk> to the Chinese <unk>.
<unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk> during the <unk> who <unk> <unk> in <unk>.
My mother was <unk> and his <unk> was <unk>.
It was taken of <unk> in <unk> at age of two years <unk> under his <unk> because he couldn't live without him.
The <unk>, who did the same, was <unk> in <unk>.
One day, he <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> and, for this <unk>, was <unk> to the work for seven years.
The pain of the <unk> can be <unk>, but the <unk> <unk> <unk> is <unk> by <unk>.
And so everything <unk> to a choice.
Do we live in the world's <unk> or we want to <unk> the world <unk> of diversity of diversity?
The great <unk> <unk> <unk>, before he died said that his greatest fear was that, in our <unk> to go to this <unk> view of the world, not only <unk> the entire human imagination of the human imagination <unk> to a <unk> <unk> of thought, but a day we <unk> from a <unk> <unk> that were other possibilities.
And it's <unk> that our species is <unk> for <unk> years.
The <unk> <unk>, which has given us agriculture, which has <unk> us to <unk> <unk>, <unk> the <unk> of the <unk>, creating the <unk> of the <unk>, creating the <unk> of <unk>, creating the <unk> of <unk>, creating the <unk> of <unk>, creating the <unk> of <unk>, and we talk about <unk> years ago.
The world <unk> <unk> <unk>.
That <unk> story, I didn't know, that we have the answers to all the challenges that we can <unk> in the <unk> to come.
When these <unk> <unk> of the world is asked what it means to be human, <unk> with <unk> <unk>.
And it's in these answers that we all <unk> the possibility of being what we are: sort of <unk>, that has to make all the <unk> and all the <unk> can <unk>. And there are big moments of <unk>.
I <unk> this picture on the <unk> <unk> of <unk>, when I went to <unk> <unk> with <unk>, and this man, <unk>, <unk> me the wonderful story of his <unk>.
The government <unk> wasn't always <unk> with the <unk> <unk> and in the '<unk> to <unk> our <unk>, we <unk> them in <unk>.
The <unk> of this man <unk> <unk>.
The family, <unk> for his life, <unk> all the <unk>, and all its <unk>.
You know, you know, the <unk> didn't <unk> the cold, <unk>.
The <unk> of the <unk> <unk> were made of <unk> fish in the <unk>.
The <unk> of this man didn't <unk> from the night or <unk> <unk> or <unk>.
It's <unk> <unk>, they <unk> the <unk> in the <unk> <unk> and <unk> in your hand. When I did it <unk>, they <unk> it, he <unk> it <unk> up, he <unk> it <unk>.
He <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk> <unk> and when <unk> <unk>, he <unk> a dog.
He <unk> the dog and created a <unk>, with the <unk> <unk> created a <unk>, and he <unk> a <unk>, and it's <unk> on the <unk>, <unk> <unk> in <unk>.
<unk> to talk about anything? [<unk>]. And this one, in different ways, [<unk>] is the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and all the <unk> <unk> of the world.
<unk> <unk> the <unk> government <unk> to <unk> the total of an area <unk> <unk> of an area <unk> <unk> of <unk>.
It's their new <unk>. It's called <unk>.
It's a <unk> <unk>. <unk> all the resources.
One <unk> of how a <unk> can <unk> with his <unk>.
And, to end, I think it's pretty <unk> at least at least at least at least at the <unk> of us.
For someone's home.
<unk> <unk> of the human imagination that <unk> at the <unk> of the time. And for us all of these children, like the dreams of our children, become part of the <unk> of hope.
To end, we <unk> <unk>, we're <unk> that <unk> never <unk> to anything.
<unk> that <unk> --
They're not <unk>, but we believe that stories can change the world, and maybe we are the best <unk> to tell the stories of the world. Every month our site <unk> million <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> our <unk>.
Our <unk> are <unk> by millions of people.
Our work is <unk> in <unk> to bring our audience to <unk> our audience in <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> from which <unk> <unk> <unk> from what <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> for the central <unk> world, the <unk> world in diversity, and we have to find a <unk> <unk> in a <unk> world. And we have to find a <unk> world of life in a <unk> and <unk> world
where the <unk> of all the <unk> can <unk> our <unk> to our <unk>.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some of the things that I <unk> you've already heard and <unk> to some <unk> <unk>, in case not <unk> them.
I'd like to start with what I call the <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> of what?
The <unk> of all the <unk> society <unk>. The <unk> <unk> <unk>: "If we <unk> the <unk> of our citizens." The way to do it is <unk> the freedom <unk>. "
The reason is, on one side, in fact that the freedom is <unk> in itself a value, is <unk>, <unk>, <unk> for humans.
<unk> is the other one is in fact that if we're <unk>, each of us can act to do everything we <unk> our <unk>, without any <unk> in our own <unk>, without any one that we're going to do everything that we're going to do to do everything that, that we're going to be in the fact that if we're <unk>, you know, we're <unk>, we're <unk>, we're <unk>, we all of us to do that,
The way to <unk> the freedom is to <unk> choice.
<unk> people have, more choices are <unk>, and more <unk> is their freedom, the <unk>, the <unk> is their <unk>.
This is, <unk> <unk> <unk> in the society that nobody <unk> <unk> to <unk> in <unk>.
And it's also <unk> <unk> in our lives.
I'm going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible.
This is my <unk>. It's not particularly big.
I <unk> a simple <unk> on the <unk> to <unk>.
In my <unk>, there are <unk> <unk>, without <unk> the 10 <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that you can buy for you a huge number of <unk> in the <unk> that nobody of the <unk> already. <unk> <unk> that nobody of the <unk> already. <unk> is <unk> of your <unk>.
That's what <unk> is the <unk>.
Then you go to the <unk> store to buy a <unk>: <unk>, <unk>, radio, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
And in this <unk> store, there's a big number of <unk>.
We can do six and a half million different <unk> using the <unk> that there are in a <unk> store.
<unk> <unk> that's <unk>.
<unk> fields: the world of <unk>.
Once I was a baby, you could get all the services <unk> <unk>, to <unk> that were <unk> by <unk> <unk>.
You <unk> the phone, you didn't <unk> it.
And a <unk> of that, between the other one, was that the phone <unk> never.
These days <unk>.
We have a <unk> <unk> <unk>, especially between <unk> phones.
Here's the <unk> <unk>.
My <unk> is in the middle, <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, and <unk> for the <unk> <unk>.
If you haven't seen it in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>, you're very <unk> that soon <unk> soon.
And what happens to the end is that people <unk> in <unk> and <unk> this question. And you know, what's the answer is, "No."
It's not possible to buy a phone that doesn't <unk>.
So, in other <unk> of life that are much more important than <unk>, they're <unk> the same <unk> of choices of choices.
<unk> <unk>: It's not going on on the United States that you're going to <unk> from the <unk> and the <unk> you know what you have to do.
Instead, <unk> from the <unk>, and the <unk> says, "OK, we might do it." Or <unk>, "<unk>," <unk>, "<unk> <unk> these <unk> and these <unk>." What do you want to do? "
You asked them, "<unk>, what do you want to do?"
And the <unk> says, "<unk> has these <unk> and these <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk> these <unk> and these <unk>."
"What do you want to do?"
And you say, "<unk> if she was, what would you <unk>?"
And the <unk> said, "But I'm not her."
The result we call it "<unk> <unk>," <unk> "<unk>", "<unk> that makes it look like a <unk> thing.
But it's not that one <unk> the weight and responsibility to make decisions from someone who knows something, <unk> the <unk>, to <unk> <unk>, to <unk> that nothing nothing knows anything -- and it's almost <unk> -- and it's certainly not <unk> to make decisions about <unk>.
There's a huge <unk> of <unk>, <unk> to people like me and you, that if you think of it doesn't <unk>.
But if we can't <unk>, why do we <unk> them?
The answer is that they want to <unk> that <unk> we call the <unk> to <unk> the <unk>.
<unk> of so fundamental as it is our <unk> <unk> is a question of choice, how you see in this <unk>. "We don't want to <unk> kids. We don't want to <unk>." We don't <unk> a <unk>. We don't have to <unk>.
And we can <unk> how many times we <unk>.
That means that any <unk>, <unk>, you have to decide that kind of person you want to be.
<unk> to the family and <unk>, a time perspective, <unk> <unk> for everyone, was that <unk> us as soon as possible, and <unk> to <unk> to <unk> the <unk> as possible possible.
The only real choice was with <unk>, not when, and even what to do after.
<unk>, everything is really to play.
They're going to be very smart, and they <unk> them 20 percent work on a time.
And it's not because they're not <unk>, not because they're less <unk>.
But why are I'm <unk>, you know, "<unk> <unk>, <unk> or not?"
"<unk> <unk> later? I have to think before the kids or to career or <unk>?"
They're <unk> <unk>.
And they try to answer these questions, even if this <unk> didn't <unk> the <unk> that <unk> and not get a <unk> <unk> to my <unk>.
And they have to do that. They're important questions.
Now, the work: we're <unk>, like <unk> <unk>, because technology <unk> us to work us every minute, every day, from every corner of the planet, <unk> that from <unk> <unk>.
<unk>, there's a <unk>, and I won't tell anybody who, where the <unk> works.
I'm not telling you, because I want to use it.
What does, this incredible freedom of choice of choice we have about the work? Is we need to decide, <unk> at any time, if we have to work or not.
We can go to see our son to play <unk>, with the mobile phone in a <unk>, the <unk> in the other, and the <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, on the <unk>.
And even if I'm all <unk>, every minute we see our son, <unk> <unk>, we're also <unk>, "<unk> to <unk> this call?"
"I have to <unk> this <unk>? I have to <unk> this letter?"
And even when the answer is, "not," all of the <unk> experience of your son very different from what would be in other conditions.
So, from all of all of them, little, <unk>, <unk> materials and <unk>, life is a matter of choices.
And I was this: <unk>, <unk>, there were some possibilities, but it wasn't all about choice.
The world of today's going to <unk> to this: <unk> is, "That's a <unk> thing, or <unk>?"
The answer is <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> we know, so I'm going to talk about <unk>.
<unk> this choice <unk> two effects of <unk> <unk> to people.
The first one, <unk>, is that <unk> instead of <unk>.
As many <unk> between which <unk>, it becomes very difficult to do it.
I'll give you an example of the <unk> <unk>.
A <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> society, with about a million <unk> <unk> <unk>, with about a million <unk> <unk> in <unk>.
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are <unk> in more, the <unk> of <unk> <unk> two percent.
In 50 <unk> <unk>, there's 10 percent less than <unk> than when they're <unk>. <unk>. Why?
Because with 50 <unk> <unk> between which <unk>, is <unk> difficult to decide, and the choice is <unk> to <unk>.
And <unk>, and again at <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and of course <unk> never comes.
<unk> that doesn't just mean that these <unk> <unk> <unk> food to <unk> because they don't have enough money, it also wants to say that the decision is so <unk> that you also have the decision <unk> <unk> work.
They don't know, they're <unk> to five <unk> <unk> for the year <unk>, that would be <unk> to <unk>.
So the <unk> is a <unk> of having <unk> choices.
And I think that's going to be <unk> the world.
And to end, for <unk>: <unk>, <unk> or <unk>?
You know, you know, if it's the <unk>, it?
You don't want to choose the wrong, and <unk> the wrong <unk>.
So this is the first effect. The second is that even if we can <unk> the <unk> and make a choice, at the end of how we have been <unk> with less <unk> between which you choose.
And this is for a few reasons.
One of these is that with many <unk> between which <unk>, if you <unk> one and it's not perfect, it's not perfect, it's easy to imagine that we could make a different choice that would be better. And what happens is that the <unk> <unk> us to <unk> of the choice, and the <unk> <unk> <unk> from decision,
And even when it was a <unk> decision.
<unk>, the more choices, it's <unk> to any <unk> that's <unk> of the <unk> of choice.
<unk>, there's what <unk> call.
Dan <unk> has <unk> very well <unk> as <unk> as the value we give to things from what we're going to.
<unk>, when you have a lot of <unk>, it's easy to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Here's an example. I <unk> with all the people who are not in New York.
But it's what you probably know.
There's this <unk> to the <unk>.
A place of <unk>.
<unk> <unk>. <unk> day. It's all for them.
They're not <unk>. But what he thinks it's, "Well, <unk>, <unk>, it's <unk>."
"All my <unk> <unk> are <unk>."
"<unk> <unk> <unk> right in front of the home."
And it's going to be two weeks from the idea that's <unk> -- every day -- the possibility of <unk> where they wants.
The <unk> <unk> <unk> for what we have, even when choice was <unk>.
And the <unk> we have <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk> us against how to <unk>.
Here's another example.
This <unk> tells us a lot of things.
We talk about the <unk>, and maybe the <unk>.
But the most important thing is that anything you're <unk>, you know, you know, you know, you're not going to others.
The things that don't know many <unk> that can make less <unk> what we do.
<unk> <unk>: <unk> <unk>.
I tried it on my skin <unk> a new <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk>.
Once the <unk> were one of the <unk>, <unk> them and <unk>, they were <unk>, only after <unk> a life <unk> and <unk> a lot of times, <unk> to go well.
So, I went to <unk> a couple of a new when the <unk> went to, and I said, "I need a couple of <unk>, this is my <unk>."
And the <unk> said, "<unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>?"
Do them want them to <unk> or with <unk>? "<unk>" or <unk> "<unk>" or <unk> "<unk>"?
"Do them want to <unk>?"
"<unk> <unk> them or <unk>? <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>? <unk> <unk> <unk> --" <unk> to <unk>.
I was <unk>, and after a little <unk>, I got a little bit of <unk>, and I got the only guy -- which was the only guy. "He didn't know what it was, so <unk> me, I got <unk> <unk>, and then <unk> out of the <unk>, <unk>, and I'd never had.
It was the <unk>. And I had all the <unk>.
But I'm <unk>.
Why? I've written a whole book for <unk>.
The reason I was worse is that with all the choice of my <unk> were <unk>, the <unk> <unk> to be <unk>.
I had <unk> <unk>. I didn't know anything about <unk> when I just had a guy, but when I had to 100 different, <unk>, at least one guy had to be perfect.
And what I had <unk> was good, but not perfect.
After I <unk> the <unk> with what I was <unk> in <unk> to <unk>.
The <unk> of <unk> in life <unk> not <unk> that <unk> the <unk> that these have <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> itself.
And this <unk> <unk>, even when the results are good.
<unk> in the world of <unk> if it makes it.
Because if I <unk> it, I'm not talking about what I'm talking about.
The truth <unk> to this.
"You know," <unk>, "The reason why he was better when he was <unk> when he was worse, he was <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk>, in the world that we live in -- <unk>, <unk> citizens with the <unk> of the <unk> -- the <unk> that we can <unk> is that things are <unk> to be <unk>.
You've never <unk> <unk> because your <unk>, my <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
The <unk> of happiness -- what you're here -- is, "<unk> <unk>," Yes, "<unk> <unk>," Yes, "<unk>."
I mean, little <unk> moment -- that I'm really <unk> and my wife is really <unk>.
I couldn't do better, I didn't <unk>.
But <unk> doesn't always <unk>.
You know, a <unk> of <unk> <unk> when there's just that kind of <unk> is that when you're not <unk>, and you say, "Why?"
"Who is <unk>?" <unk> is <unk>.
The world is the <unk>. What could I do?
When you have hundreds of <unk>, and you <unk> one <unk>, and you'll <unk> one <unk>, and you know, who's the <unk>, it's clear that the <unk> you are.
I could do better.
With hundreds of <unk> available, there are not <unk> for <unk>.
So when people make decisions, even if the result is <unk>, they <unk> <unk> and give them them to them themselves.
In the last years, the <unk> is <unk> in the world.
I think a <unk> <unk> -- not the only, but important -- of this <unk> <unk> is <unk> of this <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk>.
And when they have to <unk> this situation they think <unk> is them.
So the final result is that we're in general, we're better, <unk>, but we're <unk>.
Let me <unk> you.
This is the <unk> <unk>, what we all take for for good and it's completely <unk>.
There's no <unk> that a little bit of choice is better than <unk> at all, but it doesn't <unk> much choice.
There's a <unk> value, <unk>. I don't know what it is.
But I'm sure we have <unk> from a piece of the level where the choices we <unk> our life.
Now, from the <unk> point -- I've almost finished -- from a <unk> point of view, <unk> is the <unk>.
What allows all this choice in <unk> is the <unk> material.
There are many places in the world, and you know, <unk> <unk>, where the problem is not they have <unk> choice.
The problem is that they have too much <unk>.
So the <unk> I'm talking about is a <unk> <unk> of <unk>, <unk> society.
And what <unk> and <unk> is this: <unk> <unk> <unk> you talked about yesterday about how those <unk> and <unk> <unk> to <unk> are <unk>. It's a <unk> of money.
I mean, these choices and <unk>, <unk>, it's not that simply are <unk>.
They're <unk> <unk>.
They're <unk>.
If a little bit of what in our society <unk> choice was <unk> in the people have too <unk>, it would not only be their life to <unk>, but our lives.
This is what the <unk> call a <unk> <unk>.
A <unk> of the income is good for everyone -- not just to the poor -- because of this choice in <unk> us.
To end: "<unk>, you can become everything you want to --
<unk>, people of culture, <unk>, "What do that?"
"It's <unk> you can't make anything in a glass <unk>."
"A <unk>, a <unk> <unk> vision of the world --"
and I <unk> it up like this, I <unk>.
But then, <unk>, I realized that the <unk> knows that the long <unk> knows.
Because the reality is that if you <unk> the <unk>, you know, it's all possible, you can't <unk> the freedom. You <unk> the <unk>.
If you <unk> the <unk> so that you could <unk> <unk>.
<unk> the <unk>, and <unk> <unk>.
They all need a <unk>.
This is almost of course too <unk>, maybe even for the fish, and certainly for us.
But the <unk> of some <unk> <unk> is a <unk> for the <unk> and, <unk>, <unk>, for <unk>.
Thank you very much.
