The last year I showed these slide to show that the calculation of the type of the type of 48 million years has had the sizes of 48 million years has had the U.S. continent, is restretched about 40 percent.
And I have this subvalues the gravity of the problem because it doesn't show the ice of ice because it doesn't show the ice of ice because of ice as ice as ice as ice as ice as ice as ice as ice as ice as ice as ice as ice as ice as ice as ice as ice as ice as ice as ice as ice as ice as ice as ice as ice as ice as ice as ice as ice as ice as ice as ice as ice as ice as ice as ice as the ice that we don't show
The art glacial climate is, in a certain sense, the climate heart of the global climate system.
You can get the inverse and return out out of the summer and you get right.
The next slide will be a quick carlled on the last 25 years.
The gain redrawed are in red red it.
As you see, they expanding up to the blue so.
That's the ice in inver, which is the ice in the wind, which is the summer of summer --
You can see that the ice told told the ice of five or five years or a more or further than the blood of the boundrop from the body.
In 25 years was moving from this --
This is a problem because the interested in the art's art of the artic clips where there are enormous amount of carbon that I want to use that sheets of carbon that they are transformed in meters of the microbies.
Rempt to the totality of the atmospheric warming, that quantity could be double, that four-four of the standing of not return out, super-return out to the hor.
In some laghi deeper in Alaska foot in Alaska he's already reboiling from the water.
The professored Katey Walter of Alaska has been recated with a team of the Alaska is in the last decade of the last last invere.
Video: Wow! Al Gore: Se's good. The question is if we will also us.
One of the reason that this exchange in the Greenland the Greenland from the north.
This is a fium in the glacial record.
The levels never reached the similar levels.
This is the Kangerlerussuaware of the Greenlands of Greenlands.
If you want to know how the level of the level of the ice to the ice on earth, it's where the sea level of the ice to sea.
These corrupt corrupty range.
At the other part of the planet: Antart of the biggest block of the planet.
The last month, the scientists have declared that the balance of the ice is in negative and that Antarctics in the Western of the Western submitty of the submark matter in the sheet.
Equive in six feet of water, like Greenlevel, like Greenlands.
On Himalaya, the third block of ice block of ice block and the lacium of the glacia.
The 40 percent of the world's population was going to be half of the point of poctable.
One is And: this ice of the water is the source of this city.
The taken is increased.
But when you diminise-hand diminise the water.
In California Nevada is the Nevada is diminuth.
The rights are in crisis.
The predictions, like you have a grave.
The growth is a growth in the world door in the world door even author.
The environmental disasters are increasing a returning out out of the normal and without precedented.
Four times more numbers in the last 30 years ahead to 75 years to previous 75 years --
This is a sustainable of insustainable.
If you look at the history of the history can see the consequences.
In the last five years we added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the oceans every day.
Look attently the area of oriental Pacific Pacific of the continent, and on both parts of the continent of the continent of the continent in the oceans.
The major of global warming, together the deforestation, which is the 20 percent, is the use of the basic combustible fossils.
The oil is a problem, and the carbon is lost even worst worst
The U.S. are one of the two countries, together, together, together,
And they proposed to build a lot of other carbon and furniture carbon
But we're assisting a shift of direction.
These are the annulled projects in the last few years and some proposites of green alternative alternative alternative alternative alternative alternative projects in the last few years and some of the green few years and some of the verdies projects
At the way, there's a political lotta in our country.
The carbon industry and oil have spent 250 million dollars in the last year year to promote the charbon the last year to promote the charbon and oil industry.
The picture rericemed to me something,
Nath Natmain in Tennesse, where I was a 3.8 billion literally carbon of chories of chories of chories of carbon of chories of chories of choice chor.
Maybe you saw it on the news of it.
This is the second biggest floating of chorigins in America.
It's happened around Natmains.
The natalized public industry was this thing.
Video: She's a carbon is a basic and happy.
It's predent here in America, and it makes our economy.
Frosty the carbon is more and more clean more clean more and more clean --
It's a good price, lovable and workers keep the stypend.
Al Gore: At a lot of the West Virginia.
The biggest society on the mountains is Massey Coal. This is his friend.
Video: Don Blankenship: I'm going to be Al Gore, Nancy Pelosis, Harry Reid -- they don't know what they're talking about.
Al Gore: So the Protein Clima Clima has launched two campaigns.
This is a basis.
Video: All of the COALery seeing climates like a minum services like a minum to our business businesses.
So our priorities is to invest a great amount of money in a public sfolding and confuses the truth, and confused the truth of the charbon.
In fact, the carbon is not sport.
We think it's clean -- it's a good fum.
So not predict of climate change of climate change
Let me do you down.
Video: All right, you know, I was heard about -- you heard a lot of it.
So let's take a room in a structure to the clean to how clean to be the carbon the clean
Straordinary cars are a little wheels, but this is the sound of the clean technology of charcoal charbon technology --
The carbon consumption is between the main the main warming, but the night technology of the charcoal technology of the charcoal that you see change.
You look at a eye: this is the technology hat,
At Gore: Inally, the positive alternative positive is to economic and the national security and the national security.
Video: Comment: Here is in crisi; the economy, the economy, the national security climate crisis.
The filter that colleagues all of the combustible disbustible fossil fuel and the important, like carbon and the oil is important.
Now, there's a new new audance solution to us.
Repower America: 100-hood-year-old.
A plan to put the way in work, to make us safer safer and help stop stop the global warming.
Finally, a solution that basts solution to solve our problems.
Repower America. Scovering more.
Al Gore: This is the ultimate one.
Video: Here is a reduct energy to America.
One of the faster ways to bring the dependence on the combustible dependence on our planet.
She s: The future is here. I mean, sole, sole, a new network.
She spread -- 2: Noves investment for places to work well retribes.
All the America. It's time to be realist.
Al Gore: A old African old African old African old African old African old foot says, "If you want to go to him.
If you want to go away toge."
We have to go away fast.
Thank you very much.
The last year at TED fect in the LHC.
And I promise to go back to the way to go back to how machine.
So I came up with it. And for those who the other time doesn't have them, LHC is is the biggest scientific experiment -- 27 miles of miles of circumstombs of circumstom.
His comfortable to reconditions that were less than a billion of a billion second from the beginning of the universe -- until 600 million times a second.
Everything is just the environment.
This is the Gineva.
We have these mini-Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bield inside
This is what I work. It's called ATLAS -- is 44 feet and has a diameter diameter of 22 feet to him.
This is an ATLAs ATLAS in building so you can see the proportions.
The 10 settember of the last year we have access the machine for the first time.
And this picture was taken by ATLAS.
It was because of immenses festrating in the control.
It's a picture of the first phascise particles that had all the way around LHC, enting the LHC, and spreadly particles in the LHC, and diffondrop particles inside the LHC, and diffondled particles inside the relaevator.
In other words, when we seet image the 10 snake that the machine works, the machine works, which is a great liftye.
I don't know if it was to experience more or this when someone to Google and he went to Google and saw that the page was this thing.
That means we had a cultural impact of the scientific impact to the scientific impact.
About a week later, was a problem with the machine, just had to these files -- these files -- these files -- these dorates -- these dorates -- these files -- these dorates of the sleep.
These files are 13,000 feet when the machine works in the machine works in the power.
Now, technical technical between you look at filters and say, "It's not true. I'm filtering too underly."
And they can do it because when I'm very quick cosidents become cosidents called superconvicts.
So, at the 271 degrees, a inferior temperature in the space between the stars, these files can bring that corrupt that corrupt of the space between the star them,
In one of the most of the most of innovate innovate ate instead, there was a defect defection of factory factory.
So the files are surprised and 13,000 feet that they meet a suddenly incountered electric.
This was the result.
Now, this is even more impressive, if you think that these magnets are about 30 centimeters, and that they were moved about 30 centimeters.
They are damamaged about 50 magnets.
We had to take them to pay it, what we did we did.
We have them repristine and add them.
They're returning all the way to their place under below the ground.
Enthrows the end of marze, the LHC will be again.
We're going to accenate it, and we expect data or jug, and continuing so our well, and continuing so our adventure to discover what the universe.
Now, of course, in a certain four, these accidents reach the debate on the science and engineering in frontiers. It's easy to confuture. It's easy to confuture.
I think the fact that the fact that it's so difficult to go beyond the limits, I think this is the value of things like LHC.
I want to conclude with the words of inexperiment, Humphrey Davy, which is inuseful Davy, who image, in defense experiments of his pull, his clear was Michael Farady, he said, "No Psex is so dangerous to the progregress as the ideas that the ideas that are definitive ideas that are definitive to deal with the experiment, and in nature,
Thank you.
I want to start to ask you to think about this here, from children, they play the battle of the morning.
While you understand how to reach them and reach them and resolve them and resolve them and resolve them and resolve problems and resolve relationships and skilling relationships.
The reason is is depth is depth of the way we understand the way we understand part of the world around us.
So, by information informed by using the half of our interaction with physical objects to my consult Pac, and my collaboratory collaborator Jeevan Kalth, I started asking mouses to ask the cluster of the mouse as policy that moves as a policy that moves on a now, we could describate a physically a hard information with bottom, physically a land-hands to be information with both to the man,
and we want to do it to our please?
The question was so interesting that we decided we decided we decided we decided we decided Siftable.
In poet, a Siftable computer is a big interactive computer interactive computer.
In poet, a Siftable computer is a big interactive computer interactive computer.
You can move them with hand, they can move their hands, they can feel the motion and they have a wireless.
But absolutely physical objects, like mattpoint, you can move on it.
Siftable example of a new ecosystem to manipulate information.
And as they get more physical consciousness of the motion, and as they get more physics, and as they become more physics, and as they become more physics, of the others, like we can explore and exploring new stilds and different stilds and different stilds interaction.
I'm going to start with some simple example.
This Siftable is configured to show video if you including video -- if you can include it in a direction, if you can inct the other side of the other side back.
These interactive ritritically, are consciouss.
If they are interested in what they are interested in what they are going to do.
If they come circumstom, they can get a little bit of it.
If they come circumstom, they can get a little bit of it.
They also have their movement and incline.
And then we realized that one of the interesting interaction was the power to use communicate communicable to us, "See are" as if it was a liquid.
In this case, we have three Siftable secks like vernice seckets and I can use them to the color, where they mix mix of the central same.
and I can use them to use them to the color, where they mix they mix it.
If we can get too much of it, we can put it a little bit of it.
They're also beautiful possibilities of learning and play and play and play and play and play where people can try and look at the fast, and see the immediately.
I'm --
This is a Fibonacus, I do with a program of equations.
Here we have a game words that is half between Scarabeum and Boggle.
For of course, to every turn of the house of every Siftable, Pratally, to every Siftable, Pratally, every turn on every Siftable, and as you certain the Siftable, and while you certain control of a dition.
Then, after about 30 seconds remissing, and you have a new set of lects, and new possibilities to try to prove it.
Thank you.
Here's what children came in the Media Lab, I did them and I tried them and I spoke a video.
They are please.
And one of the interesting things of this kind of application is that you don't have to give people a lot of education.
You just have to say, "Componds of words, and they know what to do.
Here's what other people who tried it.
This is our most youngest beta younger than the right.
It wanted to actually want to crazy them.
It just was a morning to him.
Now, this is a kind of interactive cards.
We wanted to build a tool for the languages is Felix.
It can inserve new characters in the scene, to their Siftable associated with their associated associated with their associated associats.
It can inserve new characters in the scene, to their Siftable associated with their associated associated with their associated associats.
And it's doing the sun.
Video: The only is suntil is sun.
David Merrill: She took a treat in the scene.
Video: The treat.
By work!
So schooling Sift-and put them closes can interact the characters --
Video: Bau!
-- by inventing their history.
Video: He's going.
DM: It's a final story with an open-open-in-a-like top.
DM: It's a final story with an open-open-in-a-like top.
Video: Vole, I live it.
DM: The last example I have the time to show you is a tool, recently recently and exective music.
it's a instrument, realized recently, to samplate and exect music.
The Siftable here across the basis of sounds like and batteria.
Each of these has four different variations, and you can choose what use.
You can insert these sounds in a sequence to your food sequence your food please.
And to modify it by doing touch a sound "sound and a "sequenc."
These are effects that you can control from live, like the reverse and the filter.
Lattacks to a particular and then including it to add it.
And then there are the general effects as time and flying to the sequence.
Let's look like it works.
Video: DM: We're going to start with a basis in two Sift," we will start in a series, the extend to a series, extended the other basic thing, we add other basic things.
Now I put a basic line.
Video: DM: Now I add one of the perceptual --
Video: DM: And I'm going to put the filter to the bacteria, so I can control effect from live.
Video: I know -- I can know how to quick the entire sequencing the time from one or the other.
Video: DM: And I'm going to add the basic filter to give more expression.
Video: I can get the sequence of the sequence of the sequence of the volum.
So I don't have to plan the first one, but I can sudden, making it more and line it or the corty.
And finally, I can smoke the entire sequence inclining the entire sequencing the Siftable "volume."
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is building new man-machine interfaces like our brain and more look like our brain and cords, how our brain and cords.
And I have time to show you one of the results of this percord, and also some possibilities that we try to bring out of the lab.
The concept I want to transmit you is that is coming this new generation of objects to interact with digital media that will information in our world that they want to information in our world so that we want to do.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the hour of talking to everybody.
I'm a writing written writer.
Shoring books is my profession, but it's more than that, of course,
It's also the love and the fasck of my life.
And I don't expect that it can change it.
But, I said this something happened recently in my life, and my career, which I took me to realibrate the entire recalibrate the entire recalibrate with this job.
The thing is that I recently recently recently this book, this biography called Mangia, Prega, Ama." And I was a different places in the world and become a cedent, for some reason in the world and became a big sense of interaction.
And the result is that everywhere you go to now, people are treating me as if I was convicted.
By -- convict; convict!
They come from me and they all worried and they say, "You don't dry anymore?
You don't have to continue to write to write all of life could be able to create a book that good book that can be able to someone who can importing somebody?"
which can be to important someone who can you do it?"
It's a reassure of sure you know.
But it could go worst the worst of the most than 20 years ago, when I started to say people -- I was a teenago, I was a adolescent -- I want to be a trick write --
I was going to go against the same based by the wall.
And people told me to tell you about what happened?
Do you fear that the humiliation of kills you have?
You don't have to do this experience for all of life without any of the life without any of the dit of diving on a heart of saving sout, the hollutting of fallies with the mouth of falliment?"
And so, you know.
The answer -- short answer to all these questions is, "Si."
I think I fear of all those things.
I always had pain.
And I also have fear of many other things that people may not have to mean to meet.
As a further and other things --
But how I think about this is what I think, and I wondered what I think, is why is it because it is?
Is it ration?
It's logical that everybody who who have to be speaking from a job that you feel that you feel out of the work that you feel that you feel to do.
But what is that particular in the impresely creative impret to make us about health the mind of the mental health of the other way that other carries that other carriers don't do?
How do my father, for example, he was a chemical engineer and I don't remember one time in his 40 years of activities in which he was asked if he had purn to be engineer if he had purpose to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer in his father, he was going to be engineer than that was asked if you were in the further of the fashion?
It never was -- that was that the engineer of John, how do you wish
Do he didn't do that?
Onestly, the engineers like group don't have certainly, in the severy, in the several sect of being high-handiacs.
We have enough, we have enough this reputation, and not only creative writers but creative of every general reputation of being enormous instable to instable inabmentally instable to instable to the reputation of all that we have a lot of this reputation, and not only a writers but creative of every gener, we have this reputation of all the general reputation of every gener, we have this reputation,
And it's not really, the other looks at the bottom of magnific deaths that only in the 2th century, only are the people who were young and often for them.
And even the people who don't have suicide seem to be really dissent from their women.
Norman Mailer, before in the last interview of the interview of the book me a little bit more than it is a little bit more about the work of life.
But we don't bad when we heard these things that we heard these things that are so long-that some way we have interior and accepted the notion that creativity and soft the notion that creativity is in some way and the art, and it will always drop.
And the question I want to ask all of this is -- you know, are you agree with this idea?
It goes out of this -- because it looks like it from a centimeter to me not good for anything that supposed to anything that suppose is not good for anything that suppose.
I think it's hodious.
And I think it's also dangerous and I don't want to see perpetuated.
I think it's better to encourage our big minds creative forward.
And I know that, in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to begin the househing to that I think of the inner supposed to the circumstances where I are in my career.
Of years -- I mean now, I'm pretty young, I have about 40 years.
I have about four decades of work in me.
And it's very likely any thing that would be writing about the world as the work that was just going to be judged by the world as I often the next charge of my book.
I'm going to slave, because we're all more or less friends here -- it's likely to be the most success of my biggest success is to my should.
Oh, Gesus, you think that I think of it!
You know this is the kind of thinking that brings a person to start drinking hit to the nine morning, and I don't want to do it.
I would continue to do this work that we have.
So, the question becomes do?
And so I seem to go and keep up to work to keep writing is to create a psychological psychological psychological psychological psychological psychological psychological structure, OK?
I have to find a few way to find a security of me, that I'm writing and my natural reaction of what reaction reaction of the reaction of the way I started to look through the time, trying to find out the time, trying to find out of the time to see if they could have the other societies to see if they could have the best ideas and seeing other societies to see if they could have the best ideas and healthy sane of the most best ideas sane of the best seeing ideas of the sky of the best security to get --
how to help people to manage inerent inerents emotions.
And that research has taken me to the Grecia and Roma.
Seguitems because it turns out, and then back.
In the ancient Grecia and Rome -- people don't seem to believe that creativity creativity came from humans, OK?
It was thinking that creativity was this is about divine and that came to the wine and selled some surface and unknowledge -- and unknown away and unknown away and unknown away and unknown away.
They called these demonstrate divines look at creativity of the demoni."
Socry, wonderful, he believed to have a demion that elargues that elargues from long.
Romans were of the same idea, but they called the sort of spirit a genius.
The thing is that big because Romans didn't think that a genius thought that a genius was somebody particularly smart --
They believed that a genius was this kind of divine that you believe in the walls of the study of an artist, a little bit like Dobby, and that came out of the art of the art of the art and modeling the around.
Exctual -- et, that's the distance of which is the distance of psychological psychological that psychological that protect you from your work.
And everybody knew that was so that was that worked, right?
So the antians were protected by certain things, like for example, how we don't have too narcissm, right?
If your work was exceptional was there could not all the market, everybody knew that was helped by this incorporate that incorporate incorpore.
If your work fally, it was not all your whole whole thing your whole job, right?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be a inable to be a inable thing.
And so the people han concept in Occident for a long time.
Then the Rinascise came and all the changed of this big idea. And then we put the human being in the middle of the universe to the misteries of the universe and no longer leaves that writes details from divinity.
This was the rational principle of the rational and people started thinking that creativity creativity came completely from the ishare.
And for the first time in history, you began to refers this or that argu's like a genius, which is a rather than a genius.
And I have to tell you, I think it was a big error.
I think you can let someone simple person to believe to be like a recipc as the bottom, and the surface of all of my own own mysteries and inconnected ethern responsibility to a filter filter to be a very very large to be a filter to be a very large to be as human fragible to human fragile fragile phrgile of human being.
It's like to ask somebody who is the sun.
Deform and creates all these ingestilive and creates all these expectations on performance.
And I think this was a pressure that I think was this destroy in the 500 years.
And, if this is true, and I think that the question becomes and now?
Can we do it different?
Maybe you go back to a more ancient understanding of the relationship between humans and creative creative understanding.
Or maybe no.
Maybe we can't cancelling 500 years of rational thinking in a 18 minutes.
And there's probably people in the audience that would be ready suspects of scientific suspects on the notion that they follow people who following successful foundly on their projects.
I would probably not convince you all about this thing.
But the question I want to ask is -- why do you know?
Why don't you think it in this way?
Because it has more sense than any other thing that has ever heard to explain the exasperant impredictionbility.
A process of doing something that ever ever I tried to do something -- so fundamentally, all of the -- it doesn't get rationally, all of the -- it doesn't get the belt rationally, you don't get the drive of doing something --
And, in fact, it can seem completely paranormal seem completely paranormal seem completely paranorm.
I did this meet with the extraordinary poet, and I was a poetcheesses -- but that was a poetcheesses and said that during his own childhood, and he said that during his childhood, and he was working out of the rocket, and I heard it in the lands of the landscape.
He said that it was like a further trensive tren.
And he came rotate to her landscape.
It was going to come in, because he would make the ground under his feet.
It was to have a only thing to do to that point and he was talking about it, and he said, "Look like a morn."
And so it goes to the houses and come followed by this poetry and it would be going to take a paper and a pretty cool makes and a pretty quite quite quite quite a freeway, and it would take it on the pouches and reaching it on the page.
Other times could be quick fastic and corrective and corrective and correct out of the rolls and the rolled roctil rolled through the landscape, and she would continue to roll through the landscape, and he would continue to roll through the land."
Then there were the times -- this piece doesn't forget it -- there was no time -- there were the time that was almost losing the nearly losing almost losing the time --
So, he was running and was looking for the cards, and he was looking for the charge and the poetry was just the way it was the done in the time that was standing, and then he was like if you get away with the other hand and the off.
And he offed the poetry of the coda and reputs in his body and the transanscors on the pine.
And in these falls, the poetry would be presented on the perfect page and intact to the first thing to the first thing to the first one of the word to the first one.
So when I heard -- it's a crazy of the engineer to my creative process.
I don't all my creative process -- I'm not a conductough convict!
I'm a mule, and my way to work out is to see it and I can see me at the same horary every day and go up and go up and go up and go up and go up and go up and go up and go up and go up and go up and go up and go up and go up and go up and go up and go up and go to the south of the horarian hours of the time and go up and go up and go up and go up and go up and go up and go up and go up and go up and go up and go up and go up and go up and go up and go to and
But even I was in my head, I slide against that thing, I was slightly against that thing,
And I imagine that many of you have the face.
You know, even if the work and ideas I came up with a certain funny source I could not know.
And what is this thing?
And how can we relate to it to us to not lose your head, but it makes us sanish?
And as I remind, the best example I have is the Tom Waits, which I interviewed different years ago for a day.
We were talking about this, and you know, Tom, and you know, Tom, for the majority of life was the incarnation of the contemporary artist of the clean argument, dominate these species of creative impulses of creative impulses that are totally interiors.
But then he was totally hot and a day while he was driving on the under autoway's carry on the Los Angeles, changed everything for him.
He was going to fast and all of a tract track of this melodia, which comes in his head, which comes in his head, elusive and elusive and basics, and you know, it's wonderful, and you know, it's wonderful, but it doesn't know how to take it.
It has no paper, it has no mathemity, it has no mathem, it has no recorator.
So it begins to feel this kind of old old old old him, "I'm going to lose and he's going to lose and hmarroom by this song of song allow.
I'm not quite good enough, and I can't do it."
And instead of go to the panic stopping here.
And he said, "I'll have the mental process and did something completely new it.
He just looked at the sky and said, "Scus, you can't see what I'm driving I drop do?"
"To look like that can write a song hor?
If you really want to exist, you will go to a more opportunity when I can get currently care of you.
Altriments, you go to the important.
You go to disturbing Leonard Cohen."
And his working changed after this.
Not the work was still like the work as you seem to the work as you seeer.
But the process, and the fish of the anks that was released when the genius, the genius, the genius that problems and remained it was nothing and free it was remaking it from where I came to come from, and realized that he had no thing to be a interior remented.
But well this piece of worth, wonderful bizarre conversation between Tom and this strange and that was that it was not Tom.
So I heard that story to change a little bit of the way I was working and saving a little bit of a time.
This idea, saved when I was writing "Mangia, Prule, and I was in one of those cave of the disperation where we all are in the disperation that we are working on something and we can start thinking that will be a deliver.
Not only bad the worst book written writting.
And I started thinking about design.
But then I remember reminds me that talked to the air and try to it.
I was going to get my face on the hands and I would say my comments to a corner of the room.
And I said, "You ent, I mean, both you know, both that if this book doesn't be brilliant if this book doesn't be brilliant not be a little bit, right?
Because as I see as I can see, I don't have more than that.
So if you want to be better and do your party.
Okay. But if you don't know what I don't have to do anything --
I'm going to write the same because my job.
And I want to do for favor that I have been presented to me to do my own te." Because the end of the North -- secles of the North Africa -- secles of the North Africa people were dances in the long of the North of the moon, and sacred sacred to the high of the sacred and until hours and the high-hours and until hours and the high-hours and until hours to the high of the sacross the ddeserts of the sacred that
And they were always magnific because the ballers were fantastic and they were fantastic and they were fantastic and they were fantastic and they were fantastic and they were fantastic and they were fantastic and they were fantastic and they were fantastic.
But every single one of these artists become in reality became in reality translent.
And I know what I know about what I know that you have all the way you have all the way you have a certain point, a lot.
It was like the time stopping and the walking walking through a kind of lapplied and it doesn't stop anything from different from the sun, like 1,000 night from the sun, but all of all of them would be ineated by the way, but all of them would be done in the suntil of the balls and walked up with a lot of different from the suntil of the sun, and it was not a different from different sun, and the balls of a ballery and walked out of a kind of a ballerads
And suddenly not just like a human human one.
But you access to the bedrop and under the divinity of divinity.
And when this happened, the people who knew what he was called his named his name.
They were coming the hands and started to sing, "Ah, God God, Allah, God God, God, God."
That's God, you know.
Curious named -- when the Mors invaxy of Spanay the Spana, they preserve this habited in the secles of the walls of "Allah, Allah, whether you can still feel in the fle-hold, which you can still feel in the flew or in the flew or in the flew or in the flew of the corridd-habitting on the southern sout,
In Spana, when an artist did something impossible and magic artist -- and oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, hol, and I me," incomprehensible, and so on.
And it's great because we need now.
But, the problem comes day down, the dance, when you wake up and discovers that are 11 of Martedday morning and the last morning of Martedday and flight it down.
It's just a death, and maybe it's not going to be able to see that it never will be able to asck that alist higher to that althize alism.
And perhaps no dog son, the God while I still have with the rest of his life?
It's difficult.
This is one of the most dolorous reconciliations.
But maybe it doesn't have to be so anguy if you can not believe it, and it doesn't believe it, and the most extraordinary expects of your being coming from you to yourself.
But believe it was just that you get from a in-in-fount source of this squist squist of your life that you have to go to somebody else when you finished.
And, you know, if we think in this whole way it changes.
And so I started thinking about it, and it's sure like I thought for different months during the book of the book working on the book work, the dangerous charge that I will have a dangerous charge followed my big deal.
And what I have to continue to tell me when I feel electricric is not going to be furniture --
Don't fit up. It's just your work.
He represents you to present you to your party, any of your party, any of it.
If your work is ball, dance, ball.
If the wind, I mean genius to assums of leave some kind of wonder, just for a moment through your efforts through your efforts through your efforts in your efforts of beautiful thing, then "Ole!"
Of course, you do the same your dance.
And "Ole!" to yourself.
I think I have and I think you have to teach it.
"Ole!" to yourself, even for you, even to love human and head, and heads to be continued to the continue of it.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
As you know about some of these projects on human genome on the human genome of the gene genes.
Now we're starting a new percors: we started to start digitalize biology and now to that code from that code and now from that code and synthesizing and synthesizing and synthesizing and life.
We always tried to do a lot of big questions.
"What is the living?" is something that many biologists I think they have heard a levels.
We have a different approaches, reducing it to the minimum minimum --
We're digitalizing from almost 20 years hours.
When we sequenced the human genome was treating from the analogic world of biology to the world digital world.
We have to ask us -- can we regenerate the life, or create new life from this digital universe
This is the map of a little organism, the Mycoplasma genitalium, which is the tiny of the tiny genome of those who can autoreplicate in laboratory.
And we tried to reduce the genome to create a little bit smaller.
We are able to heliminate a hundreds of genes about 500 who are here.
But when we look at his map, metabolic map, it's relatively a simple respect to the now.
I think you have a simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can helimine, one to the time, it's very imlikely that this can bring to a liver cell.
So we decided that the only way to progress was synthesize this chromosomes in a way that you could move the components to some of these fundamental questions.
And so we started the wind of "We can synthesize a cromosoun?"
Can chemistry of producing these big molecules that we never have to create before?
And, in case business that we can make a cromosound?
A chromosome, it's just a piece of inert material inert material
The speed speed that we are able to digitalize the exponential running of exponential running of exponential we are able to deal with exponential we are able to deal with the exponential of the speed that we can digitalize the exponential speed.
Our ability to write the genetic code of a genetic code of it, but it's better best landing.
And our more results results results the exponential curve.
We started 15 years ago.
The process has requires a lot of the past, began to the first experiments.
But we found that synthesize DNA is very difficult.
There are thousands of thousands of cars in the world that small segments of DNA, of the long-field lecture and it's a degenerative process: more error, more errors are longer, more errors that are length of the world that they have there.
So we have to develop a new method to assemble these fragments and correct the error and correct the error hors.
And this was our first attempt to the digital information of Phi X 174.
It's a little virus that kill batter.
We have designed the fragments, effectured the correction and had a DNA molecule of DNA molecule of about 5,000 liters.
The interesting part is when we took this piece of inert material and we put it in the bacteria and we put it in the bacteria have started reading this genetic code and produce the virtual particles of virtual ches.
The virals are then released by cells, they went back and they went back and have the E.
I talked about recently recent members of oil industry saw that their own own own own this model.
They have more than you.
We believe that this is a situation that software can actually build his hardware in a biological system.
But we wanted to do things in bigger.
We wanted to build the whole chromosome.
I'm more than 58,000 lectures of genetic code of genetic code.
So we thought of built it in the size of the viruses, so that we could change the cassets to understand what the cassets are components of a living cell.
The design is crucial information and if we start with digital information in a computer, these must be very accurate information in a computer, these must be very accurate information in a computer, these must be very accurate information in a computer, these must be very accurate information in a computer, these must be very accurate.
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 the accuratezing was of a midle of the middle of the basis.
We found it, resequencing, 30 error. If we had that original using that original sequence.
One of the process of the process of the line that you get to the 50 levels that are all the other seats of 50 lects seats to build under the smaller working together.
We try to work elements here.
You probably read that we read about the big.
And think that is the way we have a genetic code on four letter: A, C, Gs and T.
Three of those labor of the labor of the labor of lects, and there's a specific order to the lect of lects,
So we can use the genetic code to write words, fray, thought.
What we did we have done in the beginning was automobile to it.
Some of them were deled by the fact that it was not a poet.
We have designed these segments to simply them to simply with the entire with the entire with the entire segments.
There are people who repair them and put them and put them and put them asyes.
And we started assembling the parts, starting with segments of seven my seven miles of seven miles of 24 miles of lectly led to their letter to get 72 miles of ld.
We have produced these segments in abundance to the dance of squence, so you can sequence, and we are trying to create a extreme -- as you will see in a minute.
We're trying to automatize the process.
So, this seems the tables of a basket.
When we get these segments, more than 100 middle of 100 middle basic miles, they will not grow the E. cold in E. cool.
You can get to the limb instruments of molecular biology tool.
So we have other mechanisms.
We knew another mechanism called "recombination of homology to rept the DNA biology to rept DNA to rept the seatments.
Here's an example.
This organism, called Deinococcus radiodurans, can three million radiodurans, can three million radiation.
You can see in the sound as his chromosomes like his chromosome.
In 12 -- 24 hours is a burning exactly as it was before.
They have thousands of organisms that are able to do that.
These organisms can set completely that.
They can live under it.
I'm absolutely certain life existed in space, and you move to find new environments of water.
At the true, NASA showed that this was that this living on.
This is a picture of the molecule that we built using these process, just using the lievidence with the design appropriate appropriate to inserious seats.
The lievidence them self-assembly indeed.
This is not been taken with a microscope, but with a microscope microscope rule.
It's a very big molecule that we can see with a microscope microscope.
These are pictures that covered a six seconds.
This is the published that we did a little time ago.
I'm more than 58,000 lects of genetic code code of genetic code.
It's the biggest molecule ever created by man.
It has a fish, a molecular heavy sounds.
If we were going to step with a 10 carattack without spaces, it would like to get this genetic code.
Now, how do we do that? How can we active?
Of course, you can track a virus is a game from kids.
It's a little more complicated when you use batters.
It's simpler even when you treat cells as well as our res: you can simply the nucleus and insert it and put it on the hands of the clonation process of clonation.
In the archaea chromosome, is integrated inside the cell phone, but we recently demonstrated that we are able to do a complete trapile of a crump from a cell and active that else of a cell and activate it.
We can have a dromosome, you can get from a species of a microbial species.
The two are different than the tough men tough.
We have some genes in a few genes in a way that I could decide what choice to this cromom for this cromom --
The one one has the way to kill with the employees of all the proteins.
And when we put it in the cells was stuff, and you just opefully our softwice, the new crum, the new cell phone.
And we had no way we could not go to become to become to him.
This is one of the biggest mechanisms of evolution.
We found that many species have added a second or a second or a third or a third of a few hundreds of new trats of new trats of new tracks to that species.
So who thinks about evolution as a gene to evolution as a gene that has not understood part of the biology.
They have the experience called "the restrian as a restrial restrial DNA.
The chromosome, which was in cell.
The cell phones the cromosomes that we insert --
It's expressed, and he recognized the other chromosome, has mastick, and we found it with only the cell and we found with only the cell and the new crum.
It's became blue to the genes we insert.
And in a short of time, all the characteristics of a kind of gatherefore -- and it turned from all species, and it turned into the new software that we insert in the cell.
All the protein have changed, the membranes are changed, and when we read the genetic code of what we have transfer what we have transfer to what we have transfer to it.
Now, this might seem like genetic alterms but altering DNA we can change things in the software fairly sustaining things in a sustain.
Now, I explained that you don't talk about genesis -- but of progress from three million years and a half million years and a half evolution, and I said that maybe we're to create a new version of the Cambrian explosion of this digital process of the degree process of the digital process of the digital process of the digital process of evolutionary process of the genese.
Why do that?
I think it's enough obvious when we think about our necessity.
We're going to spend six billion people in the next 40 billion people in the next 40 years.
Just to give example: I was born in 1946.
Now there's three people on the planet for each one in 1946, in 1946, they will be four years, they will be four years, they will be four years, they will be four year.
We're having problems now to find food, water and clean and clean and clean and drop gen billion people.
It's going to be more harder than hard to do it for us.
We can get more than five billion carbon of olide billion barbars.
That means a hundred million barbarbs a day.
When we try to find biological processes or any kind of process to replace and replace it to be a huge challenge.
In the more we have to have a hot of CO2 emissions from these materials that finished in the atmosphere.
At day, thanks today, thanks to the scientific discoveries in the world, we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I like to think that are the design components for the future.
The electronic industry has only one dozen of a dozen of components, and think about how many different things are out of it.
Our limited here are data from biological rereality and our imagination.
We have techniques, thanks to these synthesization, in synthesization, to create what we call combinatory.
We are able to build a big robot that can produce a million chromosomes to the day.
Think about processing these 20 million different genes or to try to get to make the process of producing the processing to produce either the drugs, new vaccines, we can change a little team, and create biology and create biology of the last 20 years,
And it's just a standard.
We can choose to survive for chemistry or chemistry or chemistry or carbon and vaccines of vaccines --
This is an instant, some software programmed with seats that we're working for seeing and design species and design species to the computer.
Well, we don't know necessarily know necessarily as they are.
We know exactly what their genetic code.
Now we're concentrate on four carbon four-generation.
You saw you can see that you extract from grand was an experiment experim.
We have a second flip of second and third generation that will come pretty soon zero carbon zero carbon of the higher as the types of butanol.
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without increase the cost of food, the cost of food, and limited the CO2 in the first materials would be transform CO2 in the material that we are working for cells to be transforming this discovery, and we could get this discovery, and we think we could get the first carbon generation in about 18 months.
The solar light with CO2 is a methodom -- but in our discoveries in all the world, we've found different methods.
This is a bad organism that we described in 1996.
It lives in the ocean deep of about 2500 feet of depth to the water temperature of the water.
It creates the CO2 using hydrogen using molecular energy.
We're trying to understand if we can insonate the CO2, which can easily be transported by your mind that CO2 in the urant carbon that CO2 in carbon this process.
So short we could increase what we could increase what the basic question of the basic thing is Noe, true, it's Not -- we have the high-goal to replace the oil industry.
Evacuure." If you can't do it from TED, where can you do that?
It would become a major of energy.
As to do the same methods to create vaccinistants.
You saw this year with influence, we're always background of a year and a dollar and a dollar to find vaccine the right of it.
I think that that this can change build vaccinable in the ancient anticips in any.
That's how the future could began to change it, now, the evolution of evolution, acceling evolution with synthetics, and indeed, and infinally indeed, and infinally indeed,
We are so much to the best people.
Our purpose is to make enough to try to make it a long way to try to do it. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
First of all I will see the most quick possible, some fundamental work that we have to Microsoft in the Microsoft in the Microsoft to almost a year ago exactly year.
It's a environment where you can interact is a local level, which is a huge amount of visual data from visual data from visual data --
And what we're seeing a lot of gigabyte photos with a kind of digital zoom and continue, for a fastic fast, to be able to bread, you know, you want it.
And it doesn't matter how big we see that we see, how big we see, how big we see, how big these data or the images.
Most of them are digital photographs but this for example, it's a scansion from the Bilibrary of Congress, and it comes in the gamma of 300 megam.
It doesn't do any difference because the only thing that limited the number of of a system like this is the number of place in any time. It's also an architecture in any time. It's also an architecture in any time.
This is a book inter, example, of data not images.
This is the Dickens Casa desolated.
To show you that it's just about head, and not images, we can do something like this, to see a real thing that is a real representation of the representation of the head, not a picture.
It could be a little bit of an artificial book for electronic book electronic book electronic book for a little bit of electronic book for a little bit of electronic book.
You don't think it goes.
This is a more realistic example of the Guardian for Guardian One number of Guardian.
Each picture is the beginning of a sect.
And it really gives you the pleasure and the beautiful experience of a news or a quotid-view or a quote, which is for nature of a lot of meet.
We also did something with the corner of this particular Guardian in the Guardian
We have created a high-resolution authors -- much higher than what you use in a normal published -- and we put you in the normal published of the content -- and we insert extra.
If you want to see the characteristics of this authod, you can see here.
Or other models, or even specific specific models,
And this really demonstrate some of these ideas to heliminate the limited limited space on the screen of the screen.
We hope that means to put pop up and other porks, and other porks, we don't have to be necessary.
Of course, the maps is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology.
And I don't want to lose the time, if not to say that we have to give them in this field.
These are all the roads in the U.S. obstands of NASA.
So now we go to something else.
This is actually living on the webs; you can go to see it up.
It's a project called Photosynth, which combine two different technologies.
One is Seadragon and the other is a very interesting search of the very interesting to Noah Snavely, a student, a student of Washington, with the aid of Seeliski Seliski Resear. Seliski Resear. Seliski Resear. Seelish h collaboration.
And it's from Seadragononones the web,
You can see it when we do this kind of screen -- where we can go from one picture to the other kind of resolution to the other kind of resolution to multiply solution --
But the space collocaon the pictures here has actually a meaning.
Grasms of visualization of computers have recorded these pictures together, so that the real slide-based slide-based books on the Grassis of canadies on Montags -- were of canadied canadied -- have been taken out of the chanadis of a slide-show of bread.
I don't know if I have time to show you some other environment.
There are some more space.
I want to go directly to one of the original data set of Noah-- and this is a previous prototynth that we did worked for the first time last time you have done this is really the challey -- to show you what I think I will show you what I think I think is really the challey of this technology, Photosynth. And it's not necessarily to look at the environments that we have put in the sit website.
We had to worry about legal waiting and saying.
This is a Notre reconstruction of Notre Duncing Dampictures made from Flickr. Basta digitate Dame in Flickr. and you get images of these types of these connected. And every one of these connects of these connects of these connects of the represents a picture that is discovered to this model.
So they're all picked up with Flickr and were all connected to space in this way.
And it's possible to navigate in this simply way in this simple.
You know, I would never have thought of ended to work for Microsoft.
It's very gratification of receive this kind of broad.
I think you can see that it's a lot of different kinds of different kinds of fun focam: from the those cell phones in the SLR, a very significant number of different kinds of meaningful folding in this environment.
And if I can tell us about the strange of the strange.
Many are drocket of down, etc.
On a few of here is a series of photographs -- etcold.
This is a Notre poster of Notre Dame correctly in the records.
We can go from physics to physics of this environment.
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment. This is now taking from all the memory of how to appears of how to appears -- and college all of those data together.
All of the picture becomes connected together, more of the same.
You have a model of the land that emerge.
Think about this as a virtual Stephen Lawler on Earth Lawler on Earth
It's something that grows in complexity as people us. And the people that uses us. And the vantages for people who use their us.
Their picture are marced with insert insert insert from other people.
If somebody is the idea of contranslate all these sands saying the name of Notre Dame Shydrom Dimproviously Dame suddenly Dame suddenly the data, and I can use it as a point of engineering the space, in that universe, in that universe, in that universe, using the photograph of the slide of the slide of the sh of the kind of a cross-user.
Of course, a consequence of all this is extremely elaborated every interesting part of the Earth, harvested satellitaries and seem satellitaries and several satellitaries and similar of collective virtual ses and similar of the collective virtual pattern.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I understand what your software going to have to do is that one of doing is that at certain point, in the next few years, all the photographs shared everybody in the world will be practically connect together?
BA: Yeah. That's what it's doing is basically discovered.
He's creating hyperlins, if you want to be, between images.
And it's doing it based on the bottom of the images.
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the rich information of information that many of these images that many of these images.
As when you do a research of images on the web, and the head of the web has a lot of information about the pictures of information about the pictures of photos.
Now, what happens if that picture is a connected voice?
So the amount of interconnection seeds and the amount of the rechethical recheth, it's really enormous effect.
CA: Blaise, it's really incredible.
BA: Thank you very much.
One of the major of the major delih of the ethnographics is the power that we have no plants who has no anti-tradition-forget the anti-tradition-pound of the place that is touches in the wind of the place that is in the drivers of plants.
Basti thinking that sciamans Jaguar is still beyond the Milky Lattea, or that the ancient of the ancient inclassro-standing and in Himalaya, the budhdy of Dharma, to remember the important remind the importance of the anthropoloy, and that idea that we don't exists in a sense of the world that we don't exist.
the consequence of a particular choice of choice choice that our stirps have done -- so a lot of generations ago.
And, of course, all of essential trates.
We all enjoy it. Everybody we produce.
We are subjects to began initiation.
We have to deal with inexorability of morting, so you don't surprised and drop us and balliam, and we don't surprising --
all of we have an art.
What you have found is the very particular song of song of every culture.
It doesn't matter that they are the Borneo, or the Borneo, or the Voodoo follows or the Sahara sect in Kenya sect in Kenya sectonal sectons in the Sahara.
He was my companied companied in desert a month ago, or a month ago, or a yak in the walls of Qomolangma, the demads of the world.
All these people teaching us that there are other ways to think about other ways of think, other ways to think, other ways to move in the world.
And, if you reflect a mom, it's a concept that can give you hope.
Inside, the miriddle of cultures the world create a ragnatela and cultural life that wanted the planet and cultural to be the important for the well-being of the planet so the beginning, as biosphere.
And you can think of this cultural rupt as a cultural ethnos: and you can define the ethnose of all the concept, the subject of all the concept, inspirations, intuitions in being from the human imagination of the consciousness of the consciousness of consciousness.
The ethnose is the fantastic pathrimonuries
It's the symbol of what we are and what we can be in as inquist as inissues.
And as the biosphere was free that was free high-in-a-a-in-further and purpose too much more quick.
No biologist, for example, it would say 50, it would tell you about the extinction of the extinction because it's false -- in the most of the biological diversity, in the most pocalculation -- and you don't even near the most optimistic diversity -- the most optimistic diversity.
The indical is all of course, the language.
When you were born six language on this planet.
One language is not just by a voabolary or from a series of rules gram or a series of rules gram with gramics.
One language is the human spirit of human spirit spirit of human spirit spirit language.
It's the meet with the basis of every culture comes in the material world.
Each language is a forest forest of mind, a wind, a thinking of spiritual possibilities of spiritual possibilities of spiritual spiritual system.
And of those 6,000 languages, as as we are here in Monterey, at least half the half is not sussurrounded in the earth orecraft of children.
They don't come more teached to children, unless you know, unless you walk anything, and they are already dead.
What is more tristers than being fly in the silence, of being the last to talk a language of the last to talk a language of track or to track or of the children's burn or ancient of children?
This is a little bit of a few of the world in some part of the world every two weeks of a few weeks a walls and drop with sout, and with sweeks of a single language.
And I know that somebody who will say, "Is it won't better?
The world would not be a better place if we talk about all the same languag?" Okyoruba. We talk all all the yoruba. We talk about cantonese.
Let's talk about kogist.
Scover you can not talk about what it means you can't talk about your language language.
I want to do you to do a journey through the ethnose --
a little journey in the etnight to give you a little journey of what we're love for.
Many of us forget that when I say "different ways of existing existing really different ways of existing exists.
We take for example, this birth Baras, in Amazon settrill, the people of the anaconda, which creates in the west skin the milar lands of the skin of the sken lands of the sacrid-hands of the sacrid-bad pacright.
It's a popular that is not in the forest, and it's identified the blue color, because the time of the blue is identified in the forest, which is identify in the forest, which is the popular of the popular that popular popular color.
They have a language and a language rule, "explos of language, "exogamy language, you have to be a different language.
Everything has done in the mythological past, is that in these families are talking about seven or seven language of seven language because of the marriages of mysts no practice language.
They listening to listening and then they start talking about.
We take one of the most interesting tribes I lived with which I lived -- the Waorans of Ecuador who had the first contact of the most interest, which has had the first contact in 1958.
In 1957 mission mission of a committed contact of a fact that a fact that we have a fact that
They made up from the photographs that found them in a few them returned them out that this popular lot, dimentically that this popular of the plug forest, it had never seen anything of the size.
They sent the hor, they gave the research of a shape or a shape or a shape or a shape, they have slumed that was the diavole, and they killed kills with the lances.
But Waorans don't kill the strange of them sanitors.
They kill them between them.
Sived 54 percent of the mortality was because of their own own own their own own own stand.
We are savites to eight generations and we found two houses of natural and when we insisted for knowledge that one of them was instead, and then they kill it he's dead, and then they killed it him. And then they kill it every one knowledge of the forest.
The criters were able to recognize the animal from 40 steps and recognize the species.
In the first '80s, was assigned a very interesting when my professor when my professor of Harvard was asking if I wanted to go to Haiti to intrupholarms in the first 1980s and the Tonton Macoutes, and Tonton Macoutes, and I can make the sessary of the elensedsess.
To give a sense of the miracle, I should understand the Vodoun culture and the Vodoun and that Voodom is black nera.
It's pretty much of a complex metaphors of the world.
Very interesting.
If you ask me to tell me the big religions, what do you would say to me say?
Cristian, Buddhdhy; Buddhhdhistory.
A continent is always left out of the sub-Saharan Africa-Saharan Africa, and the Voodoo doo is not that the distillustrate is now. And the Voodoo deeper is not that the distillustrate in the slave of the slavery of the slavery of the slaverism.
What makes you interesting the intense is the intense of life and death.
So you live the spirits.
The spirits can be invocated by the Grande Aqua, they answer the dance of the dance and they replaced them, and they replaced the south of the way that a short that was the hold.
So your voodoodoodoodown, they love to talk about God.
We damage in the temple, and we become God."
And from the moment you are going to be drive, is the spirit that you din?
So you assisters to these incredible events of trance events that touch touch touching the touch, you know, the bad of the power of the power of the body when it's badnet in a state, when it's bad in a state, when it's bad.
And all the people who lived with which I lived the most extraordinary Kogi is Kogi Sant, in the Kogi is Santa Mar, in the seven-mind Colombia.
Even foods of civilization that once you live on the floors of Colombia in the attention of the conquist, the popular basis that was on the floor.

Maybe some of you have heard about the ayahuasca, the most powerful psychoactive repertool of the sciamnical repertor of the sciamnice.
What makes fascinating the ayahuaxy is not the potential of the sustance, but his elaboration. It's compoint by two elements.
On one hand, this bound that contil that conties a bunch of better-carb, harmine and harvest, slightly hallucinogen.

I was often with my professor, Richard Evan Shultes, the man who has done the psychedelic, with his psychedelic, with his psychedel, in Mexico.
And I think my type you can classrooms like hallucinogens like hallucinogens because if you're done not to tell anybody of being absolutely hall.

Now it's the beauti: the beta-carbon is that you find in this boundrop are inbitors of MAO, the same kind of needs to potentiate triam. The question of the smit of 8,000 species of plants, like these popular popular popular popular -- and if you get two morphological morphologically not sized in this way, believe a biochemical version that is sum that it's sumption, but if you can see the particular of the particular the beautiful version of the s?
We use the great eufemism of proof of the proof of the provide and error, that can be revealing it.
But if we ask Indians, they will tell us "The plants talk about year."
What does it mean?
This tribes, Cofan, has 17 variety of ayahuasca, which they died in the forest, and that to our eyes would be in the same species would be in the same species in the same species.
If we ask them how they are the tassonoms will tell us "I think I understand plant, I think I was thinking of plant, I said, "No."
The solution is, you get 17 varieties in a flight of the line and each other.
With this is not you have to Harvard, but it's much more interesting than to count the stars to count the stars to count the started.
Now, the problem is that also the problem is that the people who have heart the indigens that are buts to the segs of the history of the respect of the story of the reality respect to our real real world and spends a little bit of the real real world and spend it it up.
In fact, the 20th century, between 300 years, it will not remember for the wars or the wars or innovations or technologies, but rather like the innovations of the technologies, and we have been involved and extent, the destruction of biological diversity and cultural diversity and cultural diversity and cultural diversity is not the change.
All cultures through the century have been involved in a dance to new possibilities of life.
And the problem is not technology.
Indians don't stop being Sioux don't stop being Sioux when they put from the Americans don't have stop to be Americans don't stop to be Americans don't stop to the hot and calmess.

The Neolith Rvolution that has given us agriculture, which has made us to the search of the seeds cular slide with the slide of the clerarchia of the clerargue of specialization, and we talk about 10,000 years ago.
The modern industrialized world has 300 years.
That slide stores that we have the answers that we have the answers to all the challenges that we have to do in the millenniver.
When these myridge cultures of the world is asked what it means to be human -- they answer with 10,000 voices of different voices.
And it's in these answers that we all all riscovered the chance of being what we love -- a consciousness that has to be what we have to do is that all the people and all the popular time of the people who are makes a very good moments.

in which the wisdom of all the popular well-being that is to our collective well-being collective.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some things I wrote in this book that I hope to call other than you know, and I will try to see some connect collegments, in the case doesn't have them in the case doesn't notice.
I want to start with what I call the office I call offical."
Do office dog, office dog,
The office dog, officer of all the Western industrial societies -- "If we want to massive the well-being of our citizing well-being of our citizing citizens."
The reason is that the liberty is in the fact that the liberty is precious, useful, essential for human beings.
As the other he's that if we're liber, every one of us can act to do everything that massive our well-being, without any of using our well-being, without any of us.
The way to massimize the freedom is to massive choice.
More choices people hannels the more are liberty, and it's their freedom, it's their burby.
These ritinstance, it's so deeply in the society that no one would be subject it in the society that nobody would be doubt.
And it's also deeply in our lives.
I'll show you some examples of what the progress has possible.
This is my supermarket. It's not particularly big them.
I allow a simple note about conments for inspired inspired so.
In my supermarket are 175 condments, without contart the 10 vets of oil oil and 12 acets and 12 acets of the bamsamic acacets that you can do a huge number of condition.
That's the supermarket.
Then you go to the snegotic sky to buy a stere: casses, CD, slector set, practical liphers.
And in this single snegotic sky electronic number of components audio of audio.
We can do six million different and a half million different combinations using components using the components that there are just a negotid.
You have to admit that there's a lot of choice.
Other camp: the world of communications.
One time, when I was a child, you could get all the services of the phones who were wish, unlike they were will, baby that they were fornititited by mam.
And he read the phone, you don't buy it.
One consequence of that, in the other one was that the phone doesn't rop.
These times are gone.
We have a variety of phones almost light of phones.
Here's the cellphones of the future.
My favorite is in the middle, MP3, the hidden and the broken for the nase, and force in the middle of the half of the half of the high-cras.
If you have no yet you saw in the houseen under house, you're beautiful you pretty much rever.
And what happens is that people entering in the negozes and does this question and does this question and does this question is "No."
It's not possible to buy a cell phones that don't too much things.
So, in other aspects of life that are much more important than the explosion of choice.
Assistance of healthcare of the United States that you go from the doctor and the drill you have to do.
Instead, you go to the doctor says, "Okay, could A, you could do A, or B" "A, could do this" "What's these benefit and these risks. What do you want to do you to do?"
You say, "Dot, what would I have to do?"
And the doctor says, "As these risks, and Bs these risk."
"What do you want to do?"
And you rebat, "Dotor if she was to me, what to do you do?"
And the doctor, "But I'm not here."
The result we call it the malato," expression that it makes it seems like it a beautiful thing.
But in fact, it's not that one to move the fish and the responsibility to someone who knows somebody who knows someone else that doesn't know anything -- and almost certainly is diseased -- and so in the ideal conditional to make the patient to decisions to take the patient decisions to take the patient.
There's a big marketing of marketing products drugs, direct to people like me and you, if you think about it has no sense of them is not to buy them.
But if we can't buy them, why do you publis?
The answer is that they want you to do the doctor to ask them to change us to change us the recip.
And so the fundamental thing like this is a choice, is a choice, as you see in this visual views in this -- we don't want to force the right time.
And we can reinvented us how many times we can reinvent.
The one means that every morning, you have to decide that kind of persons you want to be the kind of person wants.
Rember the family and matrimony, a time perspective of the perspective for everybody was that you could get the pretty as the most possible, and he was starting to the pretty much as possible, and he was starts possible.
The only choice was choice was with choice -- not even what to do with that.
Ogam, everything is really to play.
I mean, I think about a very smart to do 20 percent less of work than a time.
And because they're less less than not because they're less diligent.
But why are I think, I mean, I mean, I would like to ask or not, I should do it now?
"I want to spoke me more tardi? I have to think about the children?"
They're interrogative interrogative interrogative interrogative interrogatives
And they try to answer these questions, even if this imply doesn't completely the compitches and not get a drink your example.
And they have to really do that. They're really important questions.
Now, the job, we are lucky, like Carl under tolineava, because technology we have to work every day from every day of the planet, trans that from Hotel Randolph.
Timimmer, there's a corn, and I'm not going to tell anybody where, where the WiFi work.
I don't tell that, because I want to use it.
What does this mean this incredible liberty liberty that we have about the work? Is that we have to decide or not.
We can go to the hot holluing in a tasca, the Blackberry in the high, and the news, and the news and the eye tebook, and the eye tebook, and the eye tebook, and the eye tebook, and the cell phones in the bag of the hoks.
And even though they're all spent, every minutes that we see our child record the head, we are also asking this called the awish to this called the awa?"
"I have to get this email? I have to able?
And even when the answer is us, all this makes experience the experience of the heads of your child very different from what it would be in other conditions.
So, from any part of our big, little things and big things and big, materials and materials and life, life is a question of choice.
Once the world was this: Ove, there were some possibilities, but it was not a choice.
The world today is this is like this: Is that is a positive thing is, or negative negative negative or negative negative now.
The answer is She's got the story.
The positive late them all of the negative we talk about the negatives of the negatives of the negatives them all the time.
All this choice two negative effects two negatives on the people.
The first one, paradoxment, is that it produces instead of liberation.
With a lot of options that you choose to do it.
I offer an example of mean an -- one study about the conductarian example of thinking about voluntary.
One of my colleagues had access to the data of the Vancer, the companies of though, with about a million clients in 2,000 different companies.
What she found is that for every 10 solutions that are offered to the percent.
With 50 sources of offers, there's 10 percent in less than they are available to only 5. Why?
Because with 50 sources of furniture is disedetailly difficult to decide and choice is remained to question.
And on the question and more, and of course, questions, and of course isn't that you.
You know that not only means that these jobs are going to eat foods for cans because they don't have enough money, it also means that the decision is so hostic that decision is so hostics of work.
Don't participand, they're losing until 1000-dollars per year from the work, which would be a lot to the clue.
So the paralysis a consequence of having too much choice.
And I think that makes the world like this.
"And finally, for ethernity: "Letch, or major major major major major maion?"
You would like to take the right decision, if it's for ethernity, right?
You don't want to choose the wrong source, and nep, the wrong condition the wrong wrong wrong
So this is the first effect. The second is that even if we can avoid the paralysis and make a choice, we are less sodden from the result of how we would be states that you would have been choice.
And this for different reasons.
One of them is that with a lot of condition, whether you buy one and it's not perfect and it's not perfect to imagine that you could have a different choice that would be better than it would be better. And what happens is that alternative imagined us induce the choick of choice, and the remains of choice, and the remainform of the press that you could have the present of choice,
even when it was a great decision.
More choices have to be further than anything details that is insods, which is insods.
Also, there's what economists call opportunity.
Dan Gilbert asking a very well stamack of the value we depends on what we confront things we confront of it.
And the one of the people that are possible, is to represent the characteristics of alternative alternative alternative and being less soddden less sods.
Here's an example. I sware with all of the people who are not in New York.
But it's probably what you probably think you probably think.
There's this copy to Hamptons.
A place of laus.
It beds.
Not anything that he thinks is, "Well, what he thinks is August."
"Everybody all my neighbors are alien there."
"I could talk about my front of house."
And it turns to the idea that is losing -- every day -- every day -- every day -- the chance of parking where you want.
The cost of the expensive opportunity to what we have, even when the choice is excellent that we have, even when the choice was excellent.
And the things we have to consider to be considering, more characteristics will return us out of opportunities.
Here's another example.
This visual tells us a lot of things.
It talks about live the moment, and maybe living slowly.
But the most important point is that any choices you choices you choices don't do others.
The things we don't choose they can make a lot of four that can make less attenough what we do.
Terg, you wonder: growing ing the growing expectancy.
I tried on my skin buying a new jeans
I will almost always jeans.
Once the jeans were a type of a type and they were suncomfortable to bestia, they were sundissimis, and they were a lot of times, they started a lot of times, they started going to go good.
So, I went to buy a couple new when the old ones were gone, and I need a couple of jeans, this is my cuteans, this is my cuteans, this is my cuteans, this is my cute."
The comfort said, "Li wants me to slide fit, asy foot fit?"
Would you like with the cernight or with the botttons? "Wed" or "hed" or "hed" or ""?
"Like a road?"
"Sots eight you want to get them or stretttis? Bla -- -- he was elense to elense it.
I was sleep, and after a little bit I could say, "I want the only guess -- that was the only typo." It didn't know what I was like the only one I tried to all of the stands of jeans, then I tried the jeans, then I went out of the negot, with the best couple of jeans that I had ever had.
It was the myself. With all that choice had the best best ball.
But I heard worst it.
Why? I wrote a book for understand it.
The reason I was worst of the worst is that with the whole thing of the expectations were altissue -- the jeans had to be perfect.
I had expectations I had expects. I don't expect me when it was only a type, but when you live about 100 different dents, at least a perfect.
What I had watched was good -- but not perfect.
After I had to have talked to what I was trying to insumed with what I was trying to insumption to waiting it.
The add of options in life of people don't form to increase expectations that these have excellences respects.
And this will be less soddisft, even when the result is good --
No one in the world of marketing if you make it contement of it.
Because if you know about, you won't know what I'm talking about.
The truth is more like this.
"It was better when he was worst when he was worst when you was better when you was the worst when you was worst the worst of the worst was still possible to meet of the surprised surprised pleasant to meet of pleasant surprised pleasant when you was worst of the fairly in the worst of the wor
Ogame, in the world that we live -- opulents, industrialized citizens with the expectancy -- the massive that we can expect is that things are at the high-expectancy.
You won't have ever surprised because your vostands expectancy, my expectancy, they are ingiant ingiant injuggles.
The secret of happiness -- whose is you are -- "Basses expectancized her."
I mean, small point audience -- I was really how, and my wife is really ununstuff.
I couldn't have a better him, I don't have any of it.
But you don't always always is a bad thing.
And finally, a consequence of the buying a couple of jeans comfortable when you have that jeans is that when you're not satisfact, and you ask you, "Why?"
"Who is responsible for them, the answer is clear.
The world is responsible. What could I do do I that?
When you have hundreds of jeans, and you buy a insodds, and you ask the people who are responsible to the people who are responsible to the responsible you are you.
You could have a better him.
With hundreds of varieties, there are not for the insuccess.
So when people take decisions, even if the result is valized and they feeled and they feeled their hyself.
In the last years the depression is exploded in the industrialized world.
I think a factory factor, not the univer, but the important -- of this depression is that people have experiences because the standards are too high.
And when they have to explain this situation thinking that the colp, it's them.
So the final result is that in general we are better, objectively, but we feel worst it.
Let me remember you.
This is the offical, the offical, what we all take for good and it's completely falso.
There's no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than I haven't going to have to choice is better than a little choice is better than a little bit of a little bit better than a little bit of a little bit better than than I have.
There's a critical value. I don't know what it is.
But I'm quite sure we have super-sure we have been from a piece that choices our life.
Now, from the political point of view -- I have almost until view is the follow.
What it allows all this choice in the industrial society is the wealth society is the material.
There are a lot of places in the world, and you know about it -- and you know that the problem is not that they have too much choice.
The problem is that they have too pocket.
So the face face that I'm talking about is a malesclusive to the Westn, societies.
And what does it depress and arrabing is this one: Steve Levitt evitt talked about how the expensive hyests and seats are involved and seats are useful. It's a spretty spretty much money.
I mean, these choices, complicated and dispendous, it's not just inuseful.
They are a deleteries.
They make a worst standing of worst
If a little bit of what in our societies allows a lot of choice was reversed in the where people have too much choice is not just their lives to be able to improve but also the now.
This is what economists call a better paretian paretian paretian.
One rediction of the redrit reddy is not just to poor poor poor -- because of this choice that it comes back to the except of the poverty of the poverty --
And to conclude -- you can become everything that wants to --
You know, people of culture, you think about culture, "But what believes that fish look?"
"It's obvious that you can't do anything in a glass of glass in a glass of glass
"As fall, a cool vision vision."
and I was a little bit of it, and the beginning.
But then, I think about it, I realized that that fish the long.
Because the reality of facts is that if you sent in frantums, so that "everything is possible." You don't get the freedom to the freedom of the paralysis.
If you rops the mouses that all becomes possible to demine the sodddisfation.
You can get the paralysis, and you reduce the well-bee.
Everybody needs a sphere.
This is almost certainly too strecty, perhaps even for us.
But the absolutely of some symbolic symbolic infelicity for infelicity and the road.
Thank you very much.
