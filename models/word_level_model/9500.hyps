<unk> year I showed these <unk> for <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk>, which is about three million years old had the size of the <unk> <unk>, it's <unk> 40 percent.
And I'm going to <unk> the problem because it doesn't show the ice.
<unk> <unk> is, in a sense, the heart heart <unk> of climate system.
They <unk> <unk> and <unk>.
The next next <unk> is going to be a <unk> <unk> <unk> on the last 25 years.
<unk> <unk> are <unk> in red.
As you see, you can see, it <unk> to the blue <unk>.
That's the ice in <unk>, which is <unk> in summer.
You can see that the <unk> ice <unk>, of five years or more, is like the blood, which here will be <unk> from the body.
In 25 years, it's spent so,
This is a problem because the <unk> are interested in the <unk> <unk> around the ocean, where there are huge <unk> of <unk> <unk> that, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
<unk> at the <unk> <unk> <unk>, that <unk> could <unk>, that amount of <unk> could <unk>, this point of not <unk>.
In some <unk> <unk>, the <unk> is already <unk> by the water.
The <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> with a <unk> team at the bottom <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>! Al <unk>: <unk>. <unk>: <unk> is good. The question is if we're <unk>.
And that's why this <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> from the north.
This is a river in <unk> <unk>.
<unk> had never <unk> <unk>.
This is the <unk> river, in the <unk> of <unk>.
If you want to know how the <unk> <unk> <unk> for the <unk> <unk> on <unk>, here is where the sea.
These <unk> are <unk> <unk>.
And the other side of the planet: <unk>, the largest <unk> of the planet.
<unk> <unk>, <unk> scientists who <unk> that the <unk> of the ice is in <unk>, and that <unk> on some <unk> <unk>, is particularly <unk> in <unk>.
<unk> at six feet of the <unk>, like <unk>.
<unk>, the <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, you see new <unk>, which few years ago were <unk>.
<unk> percent of the world population <unk> water from that <unk>.
<unk>: This <unk> is the source of water <unk> of this city.
The <unk> is <unk>.
But when you get it, the same happens to the water water.
In California, the <unk> on the <unk> <unk> is 40 percent.
<unk> <unk> are in crisis.
<unk>, as you read, they're <unk>.
<unk> <unk> in the world door to a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> are <unk> to a normal <unk> out of the normal and without <unk>.
<unk> times more <unk> in the last 30 years than the <unk> <unk>.
This is a <unk> of all <unk>.
If you look at the context in the <unk> context, you can see the <unk>.
In the last five years we've <unk> 70 million <unk> of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million <unk> in the oceans every day.
Look at the <unk> area, from <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and <unk>, and both the parts of the <unk> <unk>, where there's a <unk> <unk> of oxygen in the oceans.
The greatest <unk> of global warming, with <unk>, which is 20 percent, is the use of <unk> <unk>.
The oil is a problem, and <unk> is even worse.
The United States is one of the two countries with more emissions, together with China.
And they were trying to build a lot of other <unk> <unk>.
But we're going to <unk> to a <unk> direction.
These are the <unk> projects in the last few years and some <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
And so, there's a <unk> politics in our country.
<unk> <unk> and oil <unk> <unk> <unk> million dollars in the last year for <unk> <unk>, which is a <unk>.
I'm going to be something --
<unk>, in <unk>, where I live, there was a <unk> of <unk> billion <unk> <unk>.
You might have seen it on the <unk>.
This is the second largest flow in America.
It's happened around <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> of one of the <unk> was this.
<unk>: <unk> â™« <unk> <unk> is a <unk> <unk>, and happy.
It's <unk> here in America, and we grow our economy.
<unk> <unk> is more <unk>.
It's good price, <unk> and <unk> <unk> it.
<unk>: <unk>, from here is a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The largest society <unk> <unk> in <unk> is <unk> <unk>. This is his <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> <unk>: <unk> <unk> -- Al <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> -- not know what they're talking about.
<unk>: So the <unk> for the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This is one of them, a part.
<unk>: <unk>: <unk> <unk>, we see the changes as a <unk> <unk> to our business.
So, our <unk> is <unk> a big amount of money in a <unk> <unk> to make public and <unk> the truth on <unk>.
In fact, <unk>, it's not <unk>.
We think it's <unk> -- it also also a good <unk>.
So we don't have to change change.
We could do it.
<unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk> -- you've heard a lot of it.
So I'm going to <unk> a <unk> structure for how much it is about <unk>.
<unk>! <unk> are a little bit <unk>, but this is the sound of the <unk> technology.
<unk> <unk> is <unk> between the global <unk>, but the <unk> technology, but the <unk> technology of <unk> that you see everything.
And let's look at this is the <unk> technology.
<unk>: <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> to the economic issue and the national security.
<unk>: <unk> America is in the crisis; the <unk>, the national <unk>, the national <unk>, the crisis.
The <unk> that <unk> all: our <unk> <unk>, our <unk> <unk>, like <unk> and oil <unk>.
But now, there's a new, <unk> solution to <unk>.
<unk> America: 100 percent of <unk> energy, in 10 years.
A plan to <unk> America to work, <unk> more <unk>, and help <unk> global <unk>.
<unk>, a solution that we could solve our problems.
<unk> America. <unk> than that.
<unk>: This is the last one.
<unk>: <unk>: It's about energy energy to America.
One of the most <unk> ways to <unk> <unk> from the <unk> that we're going to be <unk> by our planet.
<unk>: The future is here. <unk>, the sun, a new <unk> network.
<unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk> for jobs <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> America. It's time to be <unk>.
<unk>: A old <unk> <unk> says, "If you want to go to it, you go to.
If you want to go away, you go. "
We have to go away, fast.
Thank you very much.
<unk> year at TED I did an <unk> on <unk>.
And I'm going to try to <unk> how the machine works.
So here. And for those who are. And for those who have no, the <unk> is the largest scientific <unk> experiment ever <unk> -- <unk> miles of <unk>.
His task is to <unk> the conditions that were in the <unk> of a second <unk> from the beginning of the universe -- until <unk> million times a second.
All of that's just <unk>.
This is the <unk> machine.
And they <unk> these <unk> <unk> inside the <unk>.
This is what work. It's called <unk> -- it's <unk> feet and it's a <unk> <unk>.
This is an <unk> image of <unk> in building so you can see the <unk>.
<unk> 10 <unk> of the last year we've <unk> the machine for the first time.
And this picture was <unk> by <unk>.
It was because of <unk> <unk> in control.
It's an image of the first <unk> particles that had all around the <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, with a part of <unk>, and <unk> particles inside the <unk>.
In other words, when I <unk> that image is 10 <unk>, <unk> that the <unk> machine, which is a big <unk>.
I don't know if it was this to <unk> us to get more or this, when somebody <unk> on Google and <unk> that the page was this.
That means we've had a <unk> impact on the scientific <unk>.
And I was a week later, there was a problem with the machine, had to just these <unk> here -- these <unk> <unk>.
These <unk> <unk> <unk> when the machine works at the <unk> <unk>.
Now, the <unk> between you <unk> and <unk>, "<unk>," It's not true. I'm <unk>. "
And instead they can do that because when they're very <unk> <unk> <unk>.
So, <unk> <unk> degrees, at a temperature <unk> at that the <unk> of space between stars, these <unk> can bring that <unk>.
In one of the <unk> <unk> in <unk>, there was a <unk> <unk>.
So <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a electric electric <unk>.
This was the result.
Now, this is more <unk> if you think that these <unk> <unk> <unk> more than 20 <unk>, and that are <unk> about 30 <unk>.
They have about 50 <unk>.
And we did.
We <unk> them and <unk>.
They're now <unk> all to their place.
<unk> the end of <unk> the <unk> is going to be new <unk>.
The <unk>, and we <unk> to get <unk> data to <unk> or <unk>, and <unk>, and we continue to <unk> what are the <unk> that <unk> the universe.
Now, of course, in a way, these <unk> <unk> the <unk> of science and engineering <unk>. It's easy to <unk>.
I think that's so hard, the fact that it's so hard, the fact of the <unk>, I think it's the value of things like <unk>.
I'd like to end with the words of a <unk> <unk>, which, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, which, in <unk> <unk>, his <unk> was Michael <unk>, said, "No," he said, "No <unk> as the <unk> that the <unk> that the ideas of science are <unk>, that there are not <unk> in nature, that there are not <unk> in nature, that we're not <unk>."
Thank you.
I want to start <unk> to <unk> when, from children, <unk>.
As <unk> as <unk> and <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> to the way we're <unk> part of the world around us.
So, from <unk> <unk> from our <unk> of <unk> with <unk> objects, with my <unk> <unk>, and my <unk> <unk> <unk>, and my <unk> <unk> <unk>, I started to <unk>: "And if we use a computer, instead of having the only <unk> as digital <unk> that's <unk> on a <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk>.
and we're going to <unk>?
The question was so interesting that I was trying to explore the answer, building <unk>.
In a few words, a <unk> is a <unk> computer.
In a few words, a <unk> is a <unk> computer.
You can <unk> them with your hand, they can <unk> them, "<unk>" <unk> "."
But <unk>, they're <unk> objects, like <unk>, you can just <unk>.
<unk> are the example of a new <unk> of tools to <unk> the information.
And as as <unk>, as the <unk>, <unk> of the other, and <unk> as <unk>, <unk> of the <unk>, <unk> of the <unk> movement, of how we can <unk> new and <unk> <unk>.
I'm going to do some simple example.
This <unk> is <unk> to show you video: if you <unk> it in a direction, the <unk> <unk>, if you go from the other side side, I would go back.
These <unk> <unk> are <unk> <unk>.
If you <unk> them, they're going to <unk> them to what it's going to around.
If they come up, you can <unk> it and they can <unk> a little bit.
If they come up, you can <unk> it and they can <unk> a little bit.
They also <unk> their movement and <unk>.
We realized that one of the interesting <unk> was that we could use common <unk> on data, for example, "<unk> a color like if it was a <unk>.
In this case, we have three <unk> <unk> as a <unk> of <unk> and I can <unk> to <unk> for <unk> of color in the central thing, where you're <unk>.
and I can <unk> to <unk> <unk> of color in the central one, where you're <unk>.
And we can <unk> it up a little bit of a place.
I also have to <unk> <unk>, how <unk>, <unk>, the mathematics and games where people can try and <unk> things where people can try and <unk> things.
I'm now --
This is a sequence of <unk> that I do with a <unk> program.
Here we have a <unk> of words that is to half <unk> and <unk>.
And I was, every <unk> <unk> a letter to case on every <unk>, <unk>, to every <unk>, and <unk> a letter to <unk> on a <unk>.
Then, after about 30 seconds, and you have a new <unk> and new <unk> to try.
Thank you.
Here's the kids were <unk> in <unk> <unk>, I did in the <unk> <unk>, I did a video.
They're very very much.
And one of the interesting things of <unk> is that you don't have to give people a lot of <unk>.
I just mean, "<unk> of words," and they know exactly what to do.
Here we are other people who <unk> it.
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, there's the right.
But it really wanted to <unk>.
They were just <unk>, for him.
Now, this is a <unk> of a <unk> <unk>.
<unk> to build a tool for the <unk> of the <unk>. He's <unk>.
It can <unk> new characters in the scene, <unk> their <unk>.
It can <unk> new characters in the scene, <unk> their <unk>.
So, it's doing the sun.
<unk>: The sun is <unk>.
David <unk>: Now he took a <unk> in the scene.
<unk>: <unk> <unk>.
<unk> work! Yes!
So, <unk> <unk> and <unk> can <unk> the characters --
<unk>: <unk>!
And I'm going to do it.
<unk>: <unk>!
<unk>: It's a story with the final <unk>, and it can decide him how to <unk>.
<unk>: It's a story with the final <unk>, and it can decide him how to <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> away, <unk>.
<unk>: The last example I've been going to show you is a <unk>, I've been <unk> to show you, and <unk> music.
It's a tool, made of a recent tool, and <unk> music.
The <unk> here <unk> <unk> as the bottom, and the <unk>.
And you have four different <unk>, and you can choose what to use.
You can also <unk> these <unk> in a sequence of your <unk>.
And I just <unk> a <unk>, "and a <unk> <unk>."
These are actually you can control it from the live, like <unk> and <unk>.
I'm going to <unk> it to a particular sound and then <unk> for <unk>.
And then there are the effects of time, and <unk>, that <unk> to the entire sequence.
They're going to do it.
<unk>: <unk> <unk>: <unk> <unk> a <unk> in two <unk> <unk>, "<unk>," <unk> in a series, the <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
Now I'm going to go to the bottom.
<unk>: <unk>: Now I'm going to <unk> --
<unk>: And now I'm going to <unk> the <unk>, so I can control the effect from the <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>: I can <unk> the entire <unk> <unk> <unk> the time from one side or the other.
<unk>: And now we're going to <unk> the bottom to give more <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>: I can <unk> the sequence of the <unk>.
So I don't have to <unk> before, but I can <unk>, <unk> more or more <unk>.
And now, finally, I can finally <unk> the entire <unk> <unk> on the left <unk> the <unk>.
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is building new <unk> <unk> and more <unk> <unk> to how our brain work and body.
And today, I've had time to show you one of the results of this <unk>, and also some <unk> that we're trying to bring out of the lab.
So the concept I want to <unk> is that it's going to <unk> this new generation of <unk> objects to <unk> with media, which <unk> information in our world in our world's way we want to.
Thank you very much.
I'm not seeing the time talking to all about you.
I'm a <unk>.
And I'm going to talk about books, but it's more than that, of course.
It's also love and <unk> of my life.
And I don't look like that it can change.
But, I said this, a particular thing happened in my life and my career, who brought me to <unk> the whole <unk> with this work.
The particular thing is I've been <unk> on this book called "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>," which, I'm going to <unk>, for some reason reason to the world and <unk> a big, <unk>, <unk>.
And the result, it's <unk> everywhere, people <unk> me as if I was <unk>.
<unk> -- <unk>, <unk>!
I'm going to be <unk>, and they say, "You don't want to be able to do it better?
You don't have fear to keep <unk> for all life without <unk> to be able to create a book that can <unk>? "
What can you get to somebody? "
It's <unk>, you know.
But it may be worse, and I remember the most of 20 years ago, when I went to say to people -- I was a <unk> -- I wanted to be a <unk>.
I'm going to <unk> the same <unk> <unk>.
And people said, "Don't know that they don't have to be successful?
You don't have fear that the <unk> <unk> you?
You don't have fear to do this <unk> for all life without anything else is ever out and die on a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>? "
So, you know.
The answer -- the very short answer to all these questions is, "You know."
Yeah, I'm afraid of all of those things.
I've always had fear.
And I'm also fear of a lot of other things that people can't <unk>.
As <unk> and other things that are <unk>.
But, as I thought about the <unk>, and I thought I'm going to <unk> me, why?
Is it <unk>?
It's <unk> that anyone who who were <unk> to be <unk> by a work that you feel <unk> to do.
But what is that you have so particular in the <unk> <unk> <unk> about health <unk> in a way that other <unk>?
How did my father, for example, he was a <unk> <unk> and I didn't remember one time in his 40 years of activity in which was asked if he had to be <unk> <unk>?
And that was never -- that <unk> of John <unk>, how does it go?
<unk>'t that, <unk>?
<unk>, engineers <unk> like a group of course, the <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
We <unk>, we have enough enough this <unk>, and not only <unk>, but <unk> of all of these <unk>, we have this <unk> to be <unk> <unk>.
And they don't else that look at the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that, only in the <unk> century, <unk> young and often, to their own.
And the ones that don't seem to be really <unk> by their <unk>.
<unk>, before you die, in the last <unk> said, "" Every book my book has <unk> me a little more "<unk> about the work of their life.
But we don't <unk> when we were <unk> to say why we heard these things so long long that we're completely <unk> and <unk> the <unk> that creativity and <unk> are in some way to <unk> and that art, at the end, <unk>, and that art, at the end, and that art, at the end, and that art, at the end, and that art, to the
And the question I want to <unk> to all here today is: you're <unk> with this idea?
So, it's good to do this -- because it also <unk> by a <unk> of me, it's not good for this <unk>.
I think it's <unk>.
And I think it's also not to <unk> <unk> in the next century.
I think it's better <unk> our big <unk> to live.
And I certainly know that, in my case -- in my case -- it would be very <unk> to start <unk> to <unk> at that <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> in which I'm in my career.
<unk> -- I'm pretty young, I have about 40 years.
I still have about four <unk> in me.
And it's very <unk> that anything that's going to happen now in the world as the work that would be <unk> after <unk> of my last book.
<unk>, because we're all more or less friends here -- it's <unk> that my largest success is to my <unk>.
Oh, <unk>, what I thought!
You know this is the kind of thinking that <unk> a person to start <unk> at nine in the morning and I don't want to do it.
I love to continue to do this work that I love.
So, the question becomes, how?
And so I think, after many <unk>, that the way to work to continue to continue to write is what to create a <unk> <unk> <unk>, OK?
I have to find a distance of security between me, which I'm <unk>, and my natural <unk> that <unk> to get out, and my natural <unk> that <unk> to get all last year year, how to look at through the time, trying to find find other society to be <unk> with some more <unk> ideas and more <unk>.
about how to help people <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity.
And that research me <unk> to <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
because I went to <unk> and then <unk> back.
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> -- people don't believe that creativity <unk> from men, OK?
And it <unk> that creativity was this <unk> <unk> <unk> and that <unk> to men from a few <unk> <unk> and <unk>, for <unk> reasons and <unk>, for <unk> reasons and <unk>.
<unk> <unk> these <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity of creativity.
<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> to have a <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> were the same idea, but we're going to be that species of spirit without a <unk>.
And that's <unk>, because the <unk> didn't really really really <unk> that a <unk> was somebody smart.
And I think that a <unk> was this kind of <unk> <unk> that <unk> literally <unk> in the <unk> of a artist, a little bit like <unk>, and that <unk> out out of <unk> the <unk> of the artist and <unk> out the result of that work.
<unk> <unk>: The <unk> is the distance of which I'm talking -- that <unk> <unk> you from your work.
And everyone <unk> that was so that I would be, right?
So, artists were <unk> by <unk> things, like, for example, the too <unk>, no?
If your work was <unk> not <unk> <unk> all the <unk>, all of <unk> that <unk> state of this <unk> <unk>.
If your work <unk>, it wasn't all <unk> your work, right?
All of the <unk> that was your <unk> to be a <unk>.
And so people <unk> <unk> creativity in <unk> for a long time.
Then the <unk> <unk> and all <unk>, and we <unk> this big idea; we put the human center on the universe, and the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> this big idea.
This is the principle of <unk> <unk> and people <unk> to think that creativity <unk> <unk>.
And for the first time in history, <unk> to <unk> to <unk> this or that artist as a rather <unk> that person with <unk>.
And I have to <unk>, I think that was a big <unk>.
I think it's going to be like a <unk> person to be like a <unk> like the source, <unk> and <unk> all the <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk> and <unk> and <unk> it is a <unk> <unk> <unk> a lot of <unk> human <unk>.
It's like to ask somebody to <unk> the sun.
<unk> and <unk> completely <unk> the <unk> and <unk> all these <unk> <unk> on the <unk>.
And I think it was been this pressure to have <unk> artists in the <unk> 500 years.
And if this is true, and I think it's, the question is, and now?
Can we do that?
They could go back to a more <unk> understanding of human relationship between humans and <unk> <unk>.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we can't <unk> 500 years of <unk> thinking in a 18 <unk>'s talk.
And probably people in the public <unk> <unk> <unk> on their <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, you know, people <unk> <unk> <unk> on their projects.
You probably don't <unk> all about this thing.
But the question I would like to <unk> is -- why don't I mean, why?
Why don't we <unk> it in this way?
Because it's more sense of anything else that ever heard about to explain the <unk> <unk> process.
A process that, as anyone who ever <unk> to do something -- so, so, basically, all here -- so, you know, you don't <unk> <unk>.
And in fact, it can <unk> completely <unk>.
I did this <unk> <unk> with the extraordinary <unk> <unk>, who has now 90 years, but it was a <unk> for all life and said that during his <unk> in the <unk> <unk>, and he said that during his <unk> in the <unk>, and <unk> it, inside it, if a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And he said that he was like a <unk> <unk>.
And he <unk> to <unk> to her from <unk>.
I was going to get to, because he did the Earth under his feet.
I was going to have one thing to do at that point, and it was, words, "<unk> as a <unk>."
And so he was <unk> to home and he was <unk> by this <unk>, and it didn't have to get another piece of paper and a little <unk> enough to, while, <unk> and <unk> on the page.
<unk> times not <unk> to be enough enough, so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> it and <unk> the <unk> <unk> through the <unk>, to <unk>, to <unk>, and he would have <unk> to <unk> through the <unk>, to, as she said, "another <unk>."
Then there were those times -- this was not going to be the moments that was <unk> moments that was <unk>, right?
So, he was <unk> at home and he was looking at the <unk> and <unk> it through, and he was a <unk> right in the while he was <unk>, and he said, that was like if you were <unk> with the other hand, and he was <unk>.
<unk> the <unk> from the tail and the <unk> in his body and the <unk> on page.
And in these cases, the <unk> would be <unk> on the page and <unk>, but at the <unk>, the last word to the first.
So when I <unk> <unk> -- it's exactly <unk>, it's exactly <unk> to my <unk> process.
Not the whole process -- I'm not a <unk>!
I'm a <unk>, and my way of <unk> is; I'm going to be <unk>, and <unk> and work on and work on and <unk> and work on it.
But even I've been <unk> against that thing, sometimes.
And I think that's a lot of you have the <unk>.
You know, even though the work and ideas <unk> me to be <unk> by a certain source I couldn't <unk> <unk>.
And what is this thing?
And how can we <unk> it to it way to do not <unk> us to <unk> the head, but rather, what is that <unk> us?
As I'm about, the best example I have is the <unk> <unk> <unk>, which I've been <unk> <unk>, which I've been <unk> for a <unk>.
And you're talking about this, and you know, <unk>, for the <unk> of life was the <unk> of the <unk> artist <unk>, trying to control, <unk> these species of <unk> <unk> <unk>.
But then I <unk>, and a day while he was <unk> on a <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> all for him.
I'm going fast and all of a <unk> <unk> this little <unk> of <unk>, who comes into his head as <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, but it's wonderful, and the <unk>, but it doesn't know how to <unk>.
It's not a piece of paper, it's not a <unk>, it's not a <unk>.
So, he starts to feel like this old <unk> species to grow in him, "I'm going to lose, and I'm going to go to <unk>, and I'm going to go from this <unk> song.
I'm not enough to <unk> and I can't <unk>. "
And instead of going to go to the <unk>, they're going to be <unk>.
And he <unk> the whole process of <unk> process and made something completely new.
He just <unk> the sky and said, "<unk>, you don't see I'm <unk>?"
"Do you know you're going to write a song now?
If you really want to <unk>, you're going to be a more <unk> when I can take care of you.
<unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>.
They were <unk> <unk> <unk>. "
And his process <unk> <unk> after this.
I don't work, the work was still <unk> as always.
But the process, and the <unk> <unk> that <unk> was <unk> when <unk> the <unk>, the <unk> that <unk> out of him <unk>, which was <unk> out of where, <unk> was <unk> that it didn't have to be a <unk> thing and <unk>.
But I'm going to have this <unk>, and this <unk> thing that <unk> and <unk> that we <unk> and <unk> that we're going to be <unk>.
So how I would have to change a little bit about the way I'm going to be, and I'm going to be <unk>.
This idea, I was <unk> when I was <unk>, "<unk>," <unk>, "and <unk>," and <unk> in one of the <unk> that we're all working on something and we're not working on something and we're going to be the <unk> book.
Not only <unk>, just the book wrote.
And I started to think about <unk> this project.
But then I'm going to try to <unk> air and <unk> us.
So I <unk> my face on the <unk> and I <unk> my <unk> to a <unk> corner of the room.
And I said to <unk>, "<unk>, what, both of them, we know that if this book is not going to be <unk> my, no?
Because how you see I'm <unk> all I'm going to do everything I have, I don't have to do that.
So if you want it to be better, you have to <unk> and do your part.
OK. But if you don't do it, you know what, you don't do it.
I'm going to write the same because it's my work.
And I'd like to be <unk> that I'm <unk> to do my part of the <unk> because -- at the end is so, OK -- <unk> -- <unk> in the <unk> of Africa, people <unk> for the <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> of the moon, <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and hours to <unk>.
And they were always <unk>, because the <unk> were <unk> and <unk>.
But every <unk>, something <unk>, and one of these <unk> artists actually <unk>.
And I know what I'm talking about, because I know that you've all seen, at some point, a <unk> like that.
It was like the time, and the <unk> <unk> through a kind of <unk> and it was not doing anything different from the <unk>, like the <unk> <unk> before, but everything <unk>.
And suddenly it's not just as a human.
But they <unk> from <unk> and under <unk> in fire <unk>.
And when this <unk>, at the time, people <unk> what was, he <unk> it with his name.
<unk> your hands and <unk> to <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, God," God, "God,"
That's God, you know.
<unk> <unk> -- when the <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk> this <unk> with them and <unk> in the <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> "<unk>," <unk>, "<unk>," which you can still feel in the <unk> or <unk>.
In <unk>, when a artist did something impossible and <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> -- a <unk> of God.
And it's <unk> because we need.
But the problem comes the day after the <unk>, for the <unk>, when you <unk> and <unk> that are the 11 <unk> of God and <unk> it's <unk>.
It's just a <unk> with <unk> <unk>, and maybe never <unk> to <unk> it, and maybe never <unk> to <unk> that.
And perhaps nobody <unk> the name of God still as <unk>, and what has to do with the rest of his life?
It's hard.
This is one of the most <unk> <unk> to do in a <unk> life.
But perhaps it doesn't have to be so <unk> if you could <unk>, <unk>, that the most <unk> of your being being being being from you.
But I just'm going to show you that data in <unk> from a source of this <unk> part of your life that you have to go to <unk>.
And, you know, if we think about this, it's all changes.
And so I started to <unk>, and it's certainly how I've been <unk> for several months during the <unk> of the book that I was going to be <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> of my success.
And what I have to continue to continue to <unk> when I feel <unk> from this is, I'm not afraid.
You don't just <unk>.
<unk> to <unk> for your hand, it may be.
If your work is <unk>, <unk>.
If the <unk>, you're going to be <unk> <unk> <unk> some kind of <unk>, for a moment through your <unk>, then "<unk>!"
You do the same <unk> your <unk>.
And "<unk>!" <unk>! "
I think it's <unk> <unk>.
"<unk>!" <unk>! "<unk>!" <unk>, just for having a human <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk>: <unk>!
As I've already talked about some of these projects on the human genome, what it can <unk> and the discovery of new <unk> genes.
We're going to <unk> a new way: we started <unk> biology and now start <unk> the <unk> code, we're <unk> in a new <unk> of biology, <unk> and <unk> life.
We've always been trying to <unk> big questions.
"<unk> is life?" It's something that many <unk>, I think have <unk> to understand at various levels.
We tried several <unk>, <unk> to <unk> terms.
We're <unk> for 20 years old now.
When we <unk> the human genome <unk> to go from the <unk> world of biology in the digital world of the computer biology world.
Now, we're going to <unk> us, or create new life from this digital universe?
This is the map of a little <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, which is the <unk> species from the most of those who can <unk> it into the lab.
And we tried to reduce the genome to <unk> a little more small.
We're able to <unk> a <unk> of genes about 500 that are here.
But when we look at its <unk> map, it's simple than our own.
<unk>, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can <unk>, one at the time, it's very <unk> that this can bring to a <unk> cell.
So, I thought the only way to <unk> was <unk> this <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> some of these questions.
So we started the <unk> <unk>. "Can we <unk> a <unk>?"
Can the chemistry <unk> to produce these big molecules that we've never been able to create before we've ever been able to create these big molecules that we've never been able to create these big molecules that we've never been able to do these big molecules that we've never been able to create
And in case, we can do work a <unk>?
A <unk> is just a piece of <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The speed that we're able to <unk> life is <unk> to <unk> <unk>.
Our ability to write the code, instead, instead, rather slowly, but it's <unk>.
And our <unk> <unk> <unk>,
We've <unk> more than 15 years ago.
The process has <unk> a lot of <unk>, <unk> with a <unk> <unk> before <unk> the first experiments.
But we found that DNA <unk> is very hard.
There are <unk> of thousands of cars in the world that are <unk> little <unk> of DNA, <unk> <unk>, and it's a <unk> process: the <unk> long <unk>, more <unk>.
So we had to develop a new <unk> to <unk> these <unk> and <unk> the <unk>.
And this was our first <unk>, to start <unk> <unk> information of the <unk> genome.
It's a little virus that <unk> bacteria.
We designed the <unk>, we <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> a DNA <unk> of about <unk> <unk>.
The interesting thing is when we took this piece of <unk> <unk> <unk> and we <unk> it in bacteria, bacteria have <unk> to read this code and <unk> the <unk> particles.
<unk> particles are <unk> by cells, are <unk> back and they <unk> the <unk> <unk>.
I've been talking about the recent members of <unk> industry that they have certainly <unk> this model.
They have more than you.
And I think this is a situation where software can actually build his same <unk> in a <unk> system.
But I'm going to do the largest things in the big.
They were building the whole <unk> of <unk>.
They're more than <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
So we thought I was going to <unk> in the size of the virus, so that we can change the <unk> to understand what the <unk> of a <unk> cell.
The <unk> is <unk>, and if we <unk> information in a computer, these have to be very <unk>.
When I <unk> this genome for the first time in <unk> the <unk> was a <unk> for every 10 <unk> <unk>.
We found, 30 <unk>. If we were used that <unk> sequence that original sequence never been able to do it.
A part of the process is <unk> <unk> 50 <unk> that <unk> with all the other <unk> <unk> 50 <unk> to build more small than <unk> together.
And you're going to be <unk> here.
You've probably read that that <unk> us in the <unk>.
<unk>: We have a <unk> code on four <unk>: <unk>, <unk>, <unk> and <unk>.
And I'm going to <unk> <unk> about 20 <unk>, and there's a <unk> order to <unk> every <unk>.
So we can use the <unk> code for <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
What we did we did at the beginning was <unk>.
Some of them have been <unk> by the fact that it wasn't <unk>.
We designed these <unk> to <unk> just <unk> with <unk>.
There are <unk> that <unk> them and <unk> them.
And we started <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to them to them to get to <unk> <unk> <unk>.
In every step, we've been <unk> these <unk> in <unk> so that we're <unk> to create a very <unk> <unk> <unk> as you're in a minute.
We're trying to <unk> the process.
So, this seems the <unk> of a <unk> <unk>.
When we went to these <unk> much more <unk>, more than 100 <unk> <unk>, not <unk> directly in the <unk> <unk>.
You get to the <unk> <unk> <unk> biology.
So we've <unk> others.
And we're going to be called <unk> <unk>, which in biology <unk> to <unk> DNA, to <unk> the <unk>.
Here's an example.
This <unk>, called <unk> <unk>, can <unk> three million <unk> <unk>.
You can see in the <unk> as his <unk> <unk> is <unk>.
In 12 -- 24 hours, it's been <unk> as before.
<unk> thousands of organisms that are able to do it.
These organisms can <unk> completely <unk>.
They live under <unk>.
I'm absolutely sure that life <unk> in space, and they're <unk> to find new <unk> <unk> of water.
In fact, NASA showed that this is going on.
This is an image of the <unk> that we've built these <unk>, just using the <unk> with the <unk> design of <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This image was not <unk> with a <unk> <unk>, but with a <unk> <unk>.
It's a <unk> so big that we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk>.
These are picture that I'm going to <unk> a period of about six seconds.
This is the <unk> that we've done a little time ago.
They're more than <unk> <unk> code.
It's the largest <unk> of a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's got a <unk> weight to 300 million.
If you <unk> it with a <unk> 10 without spaces, we're going to <unk> this <unk> code.
Now, how do we do it work?
Of course, with a virus is a <unk> game.
It's a little more <unk> when you use bacteria.
It's <unk> simple when it's about <unk> cells as our -- you can just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> another, which is basically the process of <unk>.
In <unk>, the <unk>, it's <unk> inside the cell, but we've <unk> <unk> that we're able to do a <unk> <unk> <unk> of a <unk> cell from a cell to another cell.
We've <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> by a kind of <unk>.
<unk> are how men from <unk>.
We've got some <unk> <unk> in a more way that we could decide what to have for this <unk>.
And then he <unk> with <unk> <unk> all the <unk>.
And when we put it in the cell was <unk> and <unk> our <unk> <unk> the new <unk>, it was <unk> inside the cell.
And <unk> <unk> that we didn't go beyond, but we tried to <unk> more in there.
This is one of the largest <unk> of evolution.
We found that <unk> species have <unk> a second or a third <unk> from some part, <unk> in a second thousands of new <unk> to that species.
So who think about evolution as a only <unk> at the time, you know, it's not <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> DNA.
The <unk> that was in the cell not <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> that we <unk> it.
And it's <unk>, and it <unk> the other <unk> as <unk> material, has <unk>, and we're <unk> with only the cell and the new <unk>.
It became blue because of the genes we've <unk>.
And in a short time, all the <unk> of the <unk> of a <unk>, you go to a <unk>, and it's <unk> all in a new species, <unk> on the new software that we <unk> in the cell.
All the <unk> are <unk>, the <unk> are <unk>, and when we <unk> the <unk> code exactly what we've <unk>.
Now, this may look like <unk>, but we <unk> the software, we can change things in a <unk> <unk>.
Now, I've already <unk> that I'm not talking about <unk> -- but of progress that's going to start from three million years and a half of evolution, and I've already said that maybe we're going to create a new version of <unk> <unk> in this process.
Why do that?
I think it's enough to <unk> when we think about our <unk>.
We're going to go to six billion people to <unk> billion people in the next 40 years.
Right to give you a example: I was born in <unk>.
Now there are three people on the planet to <unk> <unk> in <unk>; in the <unk>, there will be four years.
We're <unk> problems now to find food, water and <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, <unk> and a half billion people.
I'm going to have to do it for nine billion.
<unk> more than five billion <unk>, more than 30 billion <unk> <unk>.
That means 100 million <unk> a day.
When we try to find <unk> <unk>, or any kind of process for <unk>, it's going to be a huge challenge.
In the more we have to realize all the <unk> of CO2 from these materials that we're going to <unk> the atmosphere.
At day, I'm going to talk about <unk> <unk> all over the world, we have a <unk> with about 20 million genes, and I like to think that are the <unk> <unk> for the future.
The industry will only be about a <unk> of <unk>, and think about how many different things are <unk> out.
Our <unk> here are <unk> data from reality, and our imagination.
Now we have <unk>, because of these <unk> <unk> <unk>, to create what we call <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We're able to build a big robot that can produce a million <unk> a day.
Think of these 20 million genes or <unk> to try to try to <unk> the <unk> to produce <unk> or <unk>, new <unk>, we can change, because of a little team, and create more <unk> biology in the last 20 years of science.
And it's just a standard <unk>.
We can choose to <unk> <unk>, chemistry or <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
This is a <unk> of some software <unk> that we're working on to be able to <unk> and design species at the computer.
Well, we don't know how they will be.
We know exactly how their <unk> code.
We're going to <unk> on the <unk> generation.
You saw you also saw you that <unk> from <unk> was an experiment.
We've got <unk> <unk> and third generation that we're going to be <unk> <unk> <unk> or different kinds of <unk> as <unk> or different types of <unk>.
But the only way our biology can have a big impact without <unk> <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the <unk> would be <unk> the CO2 in matter before, and we think we can get the first <unk> of the <unk> generation in about 18 months.
<unk> light <unk> with CO2 is a <unk>, but in our <unk>, we found different <unk>.
This is a <unk> that we've <unk> in the <unk>.
<unk> in the ocean, about <unk> feet at temperature temperature of <unk> water at temperature.
<unk> <unk> by CO2 using hydrogen <unk> as a source of energy.
We're trying to understand if we can <unk> CO2, that can easily be <unk> through <unk>, <unk> that CO2 in <unk>, to drive this process.
So we think that's going to be able to <unk> what the <unk> question that the basic question, "which is what life is. We <unk>, we have the <unk> goal of <unk> the whole <unk> industry.
<unk>. If you can't do that from TED, where can you do it?
It's a main source of energy.
And we're working working for the same <unk> to create <unk> <unk>.
You've seen this year with flu, we're always back to a year, and with a dollar in less when it's about find the right right.
I think what you can change building <unk> <unk>.
That's how the future might start to look at <unk>, now, the tree of evolution, <unk> the <unk> with bacteria, <unk>, <unk>, and then then <unk> cells.
We're so so on the <unk> people.
Our purpose is to do so so that we live enough to try to live enough to try to try to <unk>. Thank you very much.
First of all, I'm going to show you, the <unk> as quickly as a new <unk>, of the new technology that we've taken up to a <unk> almost a year ago. This is <unk>.
This is a environment where you can <unk> is <unk> at local level that you can <unk> it's <unk> with a huge amount of data.
So we're seeing <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with a kind of <unk> <unk> and <unk>, for a fast <unk>, <unk> the images like we want.
And it doesn't matter how big it is the amount of information that we see, how big are these <unk> of information or images.
Most of the most common <unk>, but this for example is a <unk> <unk> from <unk>, and <unk> in the <unk> of <unk>, and <unk> in the <unk> of 300 <unk>.
It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that <unk> the <unk> of a system like this is the number of <unk> on your screen at any time. It's also a very <unk> architecture.
This is a whole book, example of data not images.
This is <unk> <unk> <unk>. Every <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk>.
And so I think it's about <unk> and not images, we can do a thing like that, to see that it's really a real <unk> of the text, not a picture.
It may be a way to read a little bit <unk> to read a book.
I don't tell you.
This is a <unk> example. This is a <unk> number of <unk>.
Every image is the beginning of a <unk>.
And it really gives you the pleasure and the beautiful experience of read the real version of a <unk> or a <unk>, which is for nature a <unk> of a half.
We've done something with the corner of this in the <unk> of the <unk>.
We created a <unk> <unk> <unk> much more than what you use in a normal <unk> and we've <unk> it in the normal <unk> and we've <unk> it in the <unk>.
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk>, you can see here.
Or <unk> models, or even <unk> <unk>.
And this really <unk> some of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of space on the screen.
And I think this <unk> <unk> to <unk> and other <unk> <unk>, not to be <unk>.
Of course, the <unk> is one of the most <unk> <unk> for this kind of technology.
And I don't want to lose time, if not to say we have <unk> to <unk> it.
These are all the streets in the United States <unk> on a NASA <unk> image.
So now I'm going to do something else.
This is actually alive in the Web; you can go back to the Web; you can go to see it.
This is a project called <unk>, which is <unk> two different technologies.
One is <unk> and the other is a <unk> <unk> to the computer <unk> <unk> <unk>, a student of Washington, a student of Washington, with the help of <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And it's alive on the Web, <unk>.
You can <unk> when we do this kind of <unk>, where we can go from a image to the other other <unk>.
But the <unk> <unk> of images here is actually a meaning.
The <unk> of <unk> <unk> computers have <unk> these images together, so that we're going to <unk> the <unk> <unk> that <unk> all next next <unk> to the <unk> <unk> <unk> are <unk>. So you see the elements of a <unk> <unk> or <unk>, and these things are all <unk> <unk>, and these things are all <unk> <unk>.
I don't know if I've been to show you some other environment.
There are some more <unk>.
I want to go to one of the <unk> data, and this <unk> from a <unk> <unk> <unk> that we did for the first time the summer to show you what's really really really the key <unk> behind this technology, the <unk> technology. And it's not <unk> <unk> <unk> that we've <unk> in the website.
We had to <unk> <unk> and <unk>.
This is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> images of types of <unk> and <unk> images of types of types of <unk> and <unk> and <unk>. And on these <unk> <unk> a image that's <unk> <unk> to this model.
So I'm all <unk> images from <unk> and they're all <unk> <unk> at the <unk> level like this.
And it's possible to <unk> this way.
You know, I would never have thought to go to work for <unk>.
It's very <unk> <unk> this kind of <unk> here.
I think I'm going to see that this is a lot of different types of <unk>: from those <unk> to those <unk> <unk>, a number of <unk>, <unk> in this environment.
And if I can, I can try to look at those <unk> <unk>.
There are <unk> by <unk>, etc.
And from some part here is a series of photographs -- <unk>.
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We can go from <unk> to the physics of this environment.
The <unk> point is that we can do things with social environment. This is now <unk> data from <unk> memory of how to <unk> the Earth, from the point of view, and <unk> all that data together.
All of those picture become <unk> together, more than the <unk>.
You have a model of the entire <unk> that <unk>.
Think about this as the <unk> of the work of <unk> <unk> on Earth Earth.
It's something that <unk> in complexity as people as <unk> it, and the <unk> that we're going to <unk> the use.
Their picture are <unk> with <unk> <unk> by other people.
If somebody comes the idea of <unk> all these <unk> <unk> <unk> the name, my picture of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> all of those data, and I can use the <unk> <unk> in that space, in that space, in that <unk>, using the picture of <unk> in that space, using the picture of <unk> in that space, and <unk>.
Of course, a <unk> of all of that are <unk> models of every interesting part of the Earth, <unk> not only from <unk> <unk> and <unk>, but from memory <unk>.
Thank you very much.
CA: I realized? What do your software <unk> us to do is that at some point, in the next few years, all the <unk> <unk> from anyone in the world will be <unk> together?
<unk>: Yeah. What's doing is basically to find out.
He's creating <unk>, if you want to, between images.
And it's doing it in the <unk> of images.
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the <unk> information that a lot of these <unk> images.
As you do a <unk> <unk> on the Web, it's <unk> a <unk> and the <unk> on the page page has a lot of information about images.
Now, what happens if that picture <unk> to all your picture?
So the amount of <unk> <unk> and the amount of <unk> that <unk> is really huge. It's a <unk> effect of the network.
CA: <unk>, it's really incredible.
<unk>: I'm going to be very much.
One of the main <unk> when you <unk> and one of the <unk> research is that we can live in who have no <unk> <unk>, between who have the <unk> in the <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, <unk> it in the <unk>, the <unk> <unk> it in the <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
I think that <unk> <unk> <unk> even beyond the <unk> <unk>, or <unk> <unk>, and the <unk> <unk> are still <unk> <unk>, or <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> of <unk>, and that the <unk> <unk> of the <unk>, and that the idea that the world in which we live in <unk>, but it's only a <unk> of <unk>, but it's really a <unk> of <unk>, but it's reality.
And the <unk> of a particular <unk> of choices that our <unk> has done, well, or bad, a lot of <unk> <unk>.
And, of course, all of course, <unk> <unk>.
All of it <unk>. Everybody <unk>.
We're <unk> to <unk>.
We have to deal with the <unk> of death, so we don't have to <unk> it, and <unk> --
We all have art.
What <unk> is the <unk> is the particular <unk> of the song, the <unk> of every culture.
It doesn't matter that are the <unk> of the <unk>, or <unk> <unk> <unk>, or <unk> <unk> <unk>, or <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, or a <unk> in the <unk>.
He was my <unk> of a journey in the <unk> a month ago, or a <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk>, the <unk> mother's world.
All of these <unk> <unk> us that there are other ways of <unk> other ways to think, other ways to move in the world.
And if you're going to do it a second, it's a concept that can give you hope.
<unk>, the <unk> of <unk> world create a <unk> life and <unk> that will <unk> the planet, and it's important for the planet as the <unk> <unk> <unk> as a <unk> <unk> <unk> as <unk>.
And you can think about this <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and you can <unk> the total <unk> of all the <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, ideas, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>,
The <unk> is great <unk> of humanity.
It's the <unk> of what we are and we can be as as as a <unk> species.
And <unk> <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> was successful at <unk> and <unk> much faster.
<unk>, for example, <unk> that 50 percent of all the species has been or is on the <unk> of <unk>, because it's <unk>, or -- in the <unk> of the <unk> diversity -- and you don't even even even even <unk> to the <unk> <unk> -- that's the <unk> diversity.
The <unk> of this is, of course, the <unk> <unk>.
When you're <unk> <unk> <unk> on this planet.
It's not only <unk> by a <unk> or a series of rules.
A language is the <unk> of the human spirit.
It's the half the <unk> that the <unk> of every culture comes in the world.
Every language is a forest of the mind, a <unk>, a <unk>, a <unk> of <unk>.
And of those <unk> <unk>, while we're sitting here at least, at least half, it's not <unk> in the <unk> of children.
They're not going to <unk> kids, which means, unless you do something, which are <unk>.
What's more <unk> than being <unk> from <unk>, the last to talk about a language, of the last few <unk>, the way to <unk> the <unk> of <unk>, or <unk> the <unk> of kids?
This <unk> <unk> was <unk> to be in some part of the world every two weeks: every two weeks, every couple of weeks, and <unk> it <unk> with it in a <unk> language.
And I know that somebody of you know, "I don't better that?
The world would not be a better place if we all have the same language? "<unk>, then we're going to be <unk>.
<unk> <unk>.
And I'm going to be <unk> what it means to talk about their language.
I'd like to do a journey through the <unk> --
a little journey in the <unk> to give you a <unk> of what we're <unk>.
Many of us to say that when I say, "I mean," I really mean, "I really mean different ways.
So, for example, this <unk> <unk>, in <unk> <unk>, the <unk> of <unk>, which <unk> to the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This is a <unk> that's not able to <unk> the blue color from the green because the <unk> is <unk> in the <unk> time, it's <unk>.
They have a <unk> language and a <unk> rule, <unk> <unk>, "<unk> <unk>": you have to <unk> a person who's talking about a different language.
And all that has been <unk> in the past <unk>, yet the <unk> is that in these families are talking about seven or seven <unk> because of the <unk> <unk> nobody <unk>.
You're going to listen and then you're going to talk about.
I've been <unk> one of the most interesting <unk> that I lived, the <unk> <unk>, an incredible <unk> that had the first <unk> in <unk>.
In <unk> five <unk> have <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk>.
They've made <unk> by the top photographs that <unk> them in <unk> that <unk> <unk>, <unk> that this <unk> of the <unk> <unk> had never seen anything.
They <unk> the picture from the Earth, they <unk> to <unk> a form or a <unk> and, not <unk>, they <unk> that <unk> <unk>, and they <unk> the five <unk> with <unk>.
But <unk> not only <unk>.
They <unk> between them.
<unk> percent of the <unk> was <unk> by their same.
We've been <unk> eight <unk> and we found two cases of death and when we <unk> to know, they <unk> that one of them was <unk> so that they were dead, and then they <unk> it.
<unk> were able to recognize the animal <unk> from 40 <unk> and <unk> species.
I was <unk> a really interesting task when my <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> to do <unk>.
To give a sense to <unk>, I should understand culture and <unk> and that <unk> is not <unk> <unk>.
It's pretty pretty much about a <unk> view of the world.
Very interesting.
If you're going to <unk> the big <unk> of the world, what would <unk> me?
<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, etc.
A continent is always left out, thinking that Africa doesn't have <unk> <unk>. And instead, and then <unk> is not the <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> very <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk>.
What makes it interesting is the <unk> relationship between life and death.
So <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> can be <unk> by <unk> <unk>, <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> <unk> to the <unk>.
So, the <unk> <unk> to say, "<unk> <unk> <unk>."
We <unk> in <unk> and <unk> God. "
And from the moment you're <unk>, is the spirit that you can get you <unk>?
So, they <unk> to these incredible events: <unk> <unk> in <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a rather <unk> of the power of the mind in the body, when it's <unk> in a state of <unk> <unk>.
And we all the <unk> with which I've lived the most <unk> <unk> are the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, in <unk> <unk>.
<unk> of <unk> civilization that once <unk> on the <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> that <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
In a continent <unk> of blood, this <unk> never been <unk> by <unk>.
In <unk>, I'm <unk> by a <unk>, but their <unk> is <unk>.
<unk> <unk> are <unk> by families to three or four years, and live in a world <unk> <unk> and <unk> in a world <unk> <unk> for 18 years.
Two years years <unk> about nine years about <unk> for <unk> the nine months of <unk> that <unk> in the <unk> of the mother, now are <unk> in the <unk> of <unk>.
For this time, they're <unk> to the values of their society, which <unk> their <unk> and only their <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or to say <unk> <unk> -- or to say the <unk> <unk>.
And the <unk> of this incredible <unk>, <unk> <unk> out and the first time in their life, at age of 18 years, they see a <unk>. And in that moment of the first <unk>, when the sun <unk> <unk>, all of the <unk> <unk>, all of the <unk> <unk>, all of the <unk> <unk> <unk>, all of all that they've learned in <unk> theory, and it says. <unk>:
"<unk>? I said,"
It's <unk>. Now it's going to be <unk>. "
They call <unk> more more and say that we, <unk> <unk>, we are the <unk> <unk>, we're the <unk> of the world.
This level of <unk> is extremely important.
When we think about <unk> <unk> and the environment <unk> <unk> and the old story of <unk> <unk>, which is a <unk> <unk> in his <unk> or maybe <unk> and we say that these <unk> are more <unk> to the Earth.
<unk> <unk> are not <unk> <unk> <unk>.
There's no space for these things in the <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk>, but because of the time and <unk>, they created a <unk> of the Earth's <unk> not on the concept of <unk> <unk> <unk>. But on a <unk> <unk>, the idea that the Earth can live because it's <unk> by human <unk>.
What does that mean?
I mean that a <unk> of <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> that the mountain is a <unk> <unk> of <unk> that <unk> is going to be a very different human being <unk> and a different <unk> with the mountain or that place as a mountain <unk> that <unk> that <unk> a mountain <unk> <unk> to be <unk>.
That's the <unk> of a spirit or a <unk> <unk> is <unk>.
What's interesting is the <unk> that <unk> the relationship between the <unk> and the natural world.
I grew up in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> to be <unk>.
That made me a human being different human being different from my friends who believe that <unk> are <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> that live in the <unk> <unk>, <unk> that live in the <unk> <unk>, <unk> that <unk> during the <unk> <unk>.
If you could <unk> that these <unk> can actually create different reality, we start to understand some of them <unk> <unk>.
I've <unk> this picture at <unk> in <unk> <unk>.
Maybe some of you've heard about the <unk>, the most powerful <unk> <unk>.
What makes the <unk> is not the potential <unk>, but its <unk>. It's <unk>, but its <unk>. It's <unk> by two elements.
And on the side, this <unk> <unk> that <unk> a series of <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, <unk>.
<unk> the only <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This <unk> <unk> <unk>, very similar to <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
If you ever see the <unk> <unk> for the <unk>, the <unk>, which is that make a different <unk> of species, <unk> <unk> it.
<unk> that <unk> on the <unk> is a little bit like being <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a sea of electricity. [<unk>] [<unk>]] <unk>'t make a <unk> of reality.
I often have my <unk>, Richard <unk> <unk>, the man who <unk> <unk>, the man who <unk> the <unk> was <unk> with his discovery of <unk> <unk> in the <unk>.
<unk> my <unk> <unk>, you cannot <unk> these <unk> as you're <unk> because if you're <unk>, you can't tell any of being <unk>. <unk>, but they can't be <unk> <unk> because they're <unk> by a <unk> that's <unk> in <unk>, <unk>.
It's possible to <unk> only <unk> if you could <unk> with other <unk> <unk> that <unk>.
Now, the <unk>: <unk> that are in this <unk> are <unk> of <unk>, the same kind of <unk>, the same kind of <unk> for <unk>. The question is <unk> <unk>: in a <unk> <unk> <unk> species of plants, how these <unk> to <unk> two <unk>, but that if you're going to <unk> these two <unk> <unk>.
We use the big <unk> of <unk> and <unk>, which can <unk> <unk>.
But if you go to the <unk>, we <unk> <unk> us. "
What does that mean?
This <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, who <unk> <unk> in the forest, and that our eyes are going to the forest, and our eyes <unk> in the same species.
If the <unk> like <unk> their <unk> <unk> <unk> us, "<unk> <unk> <unk>," <unk> <unk>, you don't know all? "I said," No. "
The solution is: You get the <unk> <unk> in a night of moon, and <unk> <unk> with a different <unk>.
With this not <unk> to <unk>, but it's much more interesting than <unk> <unk>.
Now, [<unk>] the problem is that the ones of us who have heart <unk> <unk> them are <unk>, but in some way to the <unk> of our world than our real world, and beyond.
In fact, the <unk> century, in 300 years, not <unk> <unk> for its <unk> or its <unk> <unk>, but rather how it was that we <unk> and we <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> diversity and <unk>. Now the problem is not the change. Now the problem is not the change.
All the <unk> through <unk> have been <unk> in a <unk> for new <unk> to life.
And the problem is not technology.
<unk> <unk> have no <unk> to be <unk> when they put <unk> and <unk> like <unk> have no <unk> to be <unk> when they <unk> have <unk> to be <unk> when they put from <unk> and <unk>.
It's not the change or technology that <unk> the <unk> of <unk>. It's the power.
The <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And if you look at the world, you know that these are not <unk> <unk> to <unk>.
They're <unk> creatures and <unk> out of the forces that are <unk> <unk> that go beyond their ability to <unk>.
<unk> that <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> --
a <unk> <unk> <unk>, where <unk> <unk> <unk>, a <unk> that has been <unk> in the forest to a generation ago, and now <unk> the <unk> <unk>, where you can see the <unk> <unk>, where you can see the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk>,
<unk> <unk> <unk> with the <unk> <unk> to the forest.
Or, in the case of <unk>, are the diseases that are <unk> with the discovery of <unk>.
If we're going to <unk> on the <unk> of <unk>, where I'm doing a lot of research, you're going to be doing a lot of research, you'll see the <unk> <unk> of politics.
As <unk>, the <unk> physics, the physical <unk>, it's <unk> at <unk>, but the <unk>, the <unk> of the <unk> life of a <unk>, not only is <unk>, but <unk> in certain <unk>, because it does part of the <unk> of development.
And you can't understand the <unk> of the <unk> until you don't part of the beginning.
I've got the <unk> miles from <unk> in China through the <unk> <unk>, <unk> to <unk> with a young <unk>, but only to <unk>, I've been <unk> to <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> million people <unk> from <unk> during the <unk> <unk>.
The father of this guy was <unk> to the <unk> <unk>.
which means that it was <unk> to the <unk> of Chinese <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk> during the <unk> that brought the <unk> in <unk>.
My mother was <unk> and his <unk> was being <unk>.
It was brought to <unk> at age age of two years <unk> under his <unk> because she couldn't have to live without him.
The <unk>, who did the same, was <unk> in <unk>.
A day <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and, for this <unk>, was <unk> to the <unk> work for seven years.
The pain of <unk> can be <unk>, but the spirit <unk> is by <unk> <unk>.
And then, all of it <unk> to a choice.
How do we live in the world's <unk> or we want to <unk> the world's <unk>?
The big <unk> <unk> <unk>, before he died that his greatest fear was that, in our <unk>, in our <unk>, to go to this <unk> vision of the human imagination, not only <unk> the whole <unk> of thinking, but a day, it's a day that there were other <unk>.
And it's <unk> to remember that our species is <unk> for <unk> years.
The <unk> <unk>, who gave us agriculture, which has <unk> us, which <unk> us to <unk> the <unk> <unk>, <unk> the <unk> of <unk>, and we're <unk> the <unk> of <unk>, and we're talking about <unk> years ago.
The <unk> world <unk> <unk> 300 years.
And that <unk> story, I don't know we have the answers to all the challenges that we're going to <unk> in the <unk> to come.
When these <unk> <unk> <unk> of the world is asked what it means to be human, <unk> with <unk> different <unk>.
And it's in these answers that we all all <unk> the possibility of being what we are: sort of <unk>, which has to <unk> that all the <unk> and all the <unk> can <unk>. And there are great moments of <unk>.
I've <unk> this picture on the north of <unk>, when I went to <unk> <unk> with <unk>, and this man, <unk> me, and this man, <unk> me the wonderful story of his <unk>.
The government <unk> wasn't always <unk> with the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> 50 to <unk> our <unk>, we <unk> them in <unk>.
The <unk> of this man <unk> <unk>.
The family, <unk> for his life, <unk> all the <unk>, and all of his <unk>.
You know that <unk> don't <unk> the cold, <unk> it.
The <unk> of <unk> were made of fish <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> of this man didn't <unk> by night or <unk> from the <unk> that <unk>.
It's <unk> away, it's <unk> <unk>, and <unk> in their hand. When I did it <unk>, they <unk>, they <unk> it, it <unk> by creating a <unk>.
He <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk> <unk> and when <unk> <unk>, he <unk> a dog.
He <unk> the dog and created a <unk>, with the <unk> <unk> <unk> created a <unk>, has <unk> another dog and it's <unk> on the <unk>, <unk> <unk> in <unk>.
<unk> talk about <unk> with nothing? [<unk>] And this, in different ways, [<unk> is the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and all the <unk> <unk> of the world.
<unk> <unk> the <unk> government <unk> to the total <unk> of a total area of <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk>.
It's their new <unk>. It's called <unk>.
It's a <unk> <unk>. It's all the <unk> resources.
One example of how a <unk> can <unk> with his <unk>.
And, to end, I think it's quite quite <unk> at least at least at least, I think it's not quite <unk>.
For somebody is home.
<unk> <unk> of the human imagination that <unk> to the <unk> of the time. And for us all, the dreams of these children, become part of the <unk> of the hope.
To end, we're <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk>, we've never been at anything.
<unk> that <unk> --
<unk> are not <unk>, but we believe that stories can change the world, and maybe we're the best <unk> to tell stories of the world. Every month our <unk> a country of our website <unk> <unk> million <unk>.
<unk> <unk> our <unk> <unk>.
Our <unk> are <unk> by millions of people.
Our work is <unk> in <unk> to bring our public in places that <unk> from which <unk> <unk> from which <unk> from which <unk> <unk> from which <unk> how they saw and, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and we have to find a <unk> <unk> life in a <unk> world and <unk>.
where the <unk> of all the <unk> can <unk> to our <unk> <unk>.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some things that I've been written in this book that I hope you've already heard and <unk> some <unk>, in the case, you don't get them.
I'd like to start with what I call "<unk> <unk> <unk>."
What would you know?
The <unk> <unk> of all the <unk> society. The <unk> <unk> <unk>: "If we want to <unk> the <unk> of our citizens" <unk> "The way to do it is <unk> the <unk>."
The reason is, from one side, in fact that the freedom is <unk>, is <unk>, <unk>, <unk> for human beings.
And then, it's in fact that if we are <unk>, each of us can act to do everything that <unk> our <unk>, without any one of us to <unk> our name.
The way to <unk> the freedom is to <unk> choice.
The more choices people have, more <unk>, and more <unk>, and more, and more, it's their <unk>.
This, <unk>, it's so <unk> in society that nobody <unk> <unk> in <unk>.
And it's also <unk> <unk> in our lives.
I'm going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible.
This is my <unk>. It's not particularly big.
I'm going to be a simple note on the <unk> to <unk>.
In my <unk>, there are <unk> <unk>, without <unk> 10 <unk> <unk> <unk> that you can buy for <unk> and the 12 <unk> that you can buy a huge number of <unk> in the <unk> that nobody of <unk> <unk>.
That's what <unk>.
Then you go to the store store <unk> for a <unk>: <unk>, <unk>, radio, <unk>, <unk>.
And in this single store <unk>, there's a big number of <unk>.
We can make six million of different <unk> using the <unk> that there are only a store that there are only a store.
<unk> <unk> that there is <unk> choice.
<unk>: The world of <unk>.
Once, when I was a child, you could get all the services <unk> <unk>, to <unk> that they were <unk> by <unk> <unk>.
You <unk> the phone, you don't <unk> it.
And a <unk> of that, in the other, was that the phone never <unk>.
These times I went to.
We've got a <unk> <unk> <unk>, especially between the phones.
Here's the <unk> cell future.
My <unk> is that in the middle, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, and <unk> for <unk> <unk>.
If you haven't seen it in the store under the house, you're very very early <unk>.
And what people will happen is that people <unk> in <unk> and does this question. And you know, what is the answer? The answer is, "No."
It's not possible to buy a phone that doesn't <unk> things.
So, in other <unk> of life that are much more important than <unk>, <unk> the same <unk>, <unk> the same <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>, not happens, the United States that you're going to be <unk> and the <unk> you.
Instead, I'm going to go out and <unk>, "<unk>, we could do it," or <unk> "<unk>" <unk> "<unk>" <unk> "<unk> <unk> these <unk> and <unk>. What do you want to do?"
You know, "<unk>, what do you do?"
And the <unk> says, "<unk>," <unk>, "<unk>," <unk>, "
"What do you want to do?"
And you say, "<unk> if she was me, what would you say?"
And the <unk>: "But I'm not her."
The result we call it "<unk>", "<unk>" <unk>, "<unk> that makes it look like a thing.
But in fact, it's not that a <unk> weight and responsibility for someone who know something, <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and it's not <unk> -- and it's not <unk>, and so it's not <unk> to make decisions decisions.
There's a huge <unk> of <unk> products, <unk> to people like me and you, that if you think about it, you know, if you think it's not <unk>.
But if we can't <unk>, why do we <unk> them?
The answer is that they want to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And so fundamental as it is our <unk> <unk> is a question of choice, how we're seeing in this <unk>. "We don't want to <unk> kids. We're not going to be <unk>." We have to <unk>. We have to have to <unk>.
And we can <unk> how many times we <unk> it.
What means that every <unk>, you have to decide that kind of person being.
I'm going to <unk>, a time time the common perspective, <unk> <unk>, <unk> almost anyone, was that <unk> as soon as possible, and they were <unk> to get kids to be possible.
The only real choice was with, not when, and even what to do after.
<unk>, all it really is to play.
They were going to <unk> very smart, and they <unk> their 20 percent in less than a time.
And because they're not <unk>, not because they're not <unk>.
But why I'm <unk>, you know, "<unk> <unk> or not? <unk>?"
"<unk> <unk> later? I have to think before or kids or to career?"
I'm <unk> <unk>.
And they try to answer these questions, even if this <unk> doesn't <unk> the <unk> that <unk> and <unk> and not get a nice <unk> to my <unk>.
And they have to do that. They're important questions.
Now, the work: we're <unk>, as <unk> <unk>, because the technology allows us to work every minute, every day, from every corner of the planet, <unk> from the <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, there's a <unk>, and I'm not going to say what <unk> works.
I'm not going to show you, because I want to use it.
What does, this incredible freedom to choice that we have about the work? It's we have to decide, we're going to decide, if we have to work or not.
We can go to see our son to play, with the phone in a <unk>, the <unk> in the other, and <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, on <unk>.
And if I'm all <unk>, every minute we see our son, we're also <unk>, "I have to <unk>," I have to answer this called "
"I have to answer this <unk>? I have to <unk> this letter?"
And when the answer is, "no," all of this <unk> experience of your son very different than what it would be in other conditions.
So, from any part of course, we look at, and big, materials and <unk> life, life is a question of choices.
And once the world was this: <unk>, there were some possibility, but it wasn't a question of choice.
The world today today's going to be: "<unk> is," It's what <unk>, or <unk>? "
The answer is <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, we know all, so I'm going to talk about those <unk>.
<unk> this choice <unk> two effects of people actually <unk> on people.
The first one, <unk>, is that <unk> instead of <unk>.
With a lot of <unk> that choose, becomes very hard to do.
I'm going to give you a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
A <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, the <unk> society, the <unk> society of <unk> <unk>, with about a million <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk>.
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk> of two percent.
With 50 <unk> <unk>, there's 10 percent in less than <unk> than when they're only <unk>. Why do it?
Because with 50 <unk> in which <unk>, is <unk> hard to decide, and <unk> choice is <unk>.
And <unk>, and still <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and of course, <unk>, and of course, <unk> never get.
<unk> that doesn't mean only, these <unk> <unk> <unk> food for <unk> because they don't have enough money, it also wants to say that the decision is so <unk> that we're also <unk> the <unk> <unk> of work.
They don't <unk>, they're going to <unk> to <unk> <unk> for year from <unk> to work, which would be <unk>.
So the <unk> is a <unk> of having <unk> choices.
And I think it's going to be the world.
"And to end, for <unk>: <unk>, <unk> or <unk>?"
You know, you know, if it's for <unk>, isn't it?
You don't want to choose the wrong wrong, and you get the wrong <unk>.
So this is the first effect. The second is that we can <unk> <unk> and make choice, at the end, we're less <unk> from the result of how to <unk> states with less <unk> in which you have to have.
And this is for several reasons.
One of these is that with many <unk> of which choose, if you're going to <unk> one and it's not a perfect, it's not a perfect way that would be better. And what happens is that the <unk> <unk> <unk> us to <unk> choice, and the <unk> <unk> <unk> from choice, and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> the decision,
And when it was a decision.
The more choices there are, <unk> <unk> to any <unk> that it's <unk> of any <unk> that it's <unk>.
And then, there's what <unk> call.
Dan <unk> <unk> <unk> very well as the value that we give the <unk> things that we give the <unk>.
<unk>, when there are a lot of <unk>, it's easy to <unk> the <unk> <unk> and being less <unk> than <unk> <unk> and being less <unk> than <unk> <unk>.
So, this is a example. I'm going to be in New York.
But that's probably what you probably do.
There's this <unk> to <unk>.
A place of <unk>.
<unk> <unk>. <unk> day. It's all about them.
I don't know anything. But what he thinks is, "Well, <unk>, it's <unk>."
"All my <unk> <unk> are away."
"<unk> <unk> just in front of the house."
And it's going to go to the idea of -- every day -- the possibility of <unk> where you want.
The <unk> <unk> for what we have, even when choice was <unk>.
And the <unk> are the <unk> that we have from <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk> us to <unk> them.
Here's another example.
This <unk> tells us a lot of things.
We talk about living the moment, and maybe a slowly time.
But the most important thing is that you're going to be <unk>, you're not going to do the other.
The things that don't have a lot of <unk> that can make less <unk> what we do.
<unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk>.
I tried it on my skin a new couple of <unk>.
It's always <unk>.
And once the <unk> were just like, and they were <unk>, and they were <unk>, only after <unk> a life and <unk> a lot of times, they were <unk>, and I would go well.
So, I went to <unk> a couple of a new when the <unk> were gone, and I said, "I need a couple of <unk>, this is my <unk>."
The <unk> said, "<unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>?"
They want them to <unk> or <unk>? "
"Do them want to <unk>?"
"<unk> <unk> them <unk> or <unk>? <unk> <unk> <unk> --" <unk> to <unk>. "
I was <unk>, and after a little bit I was able to say, "I want the guy that was the only guy that was, so for a time. I'm <unk> all the <unk> <unk> <unk>, then I <unk> all of the <unk> <unk>, and then I had ever had.
It was the <unk>. With all that choice had <unk> the best.
But it's worse.
Why? I did I wrote a whole book for <unk>.
The reason I was worse is that with all that choice my <unk> were <unk>, <unk> <unk> to be <unk>.
I had <unk> <unk>. I didn't know anything about <unk> when I only had a guy, but when I was <unk> to be a perfect thing.
What I had to be good, but not perfect.
After I had to <unk> that I was <unk> in <unk> to <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> in life of people don't do that <unk> the <unk> that these <unk> have <unk> that these <unk> <unk>.
And this <unk> less <unk>, even when the results are good.
<unk> in the world of <unk> <unk>, it makes it.
Because if I <unk> it, I don't know what I'm talking about.
The truth truth is more at this.
"You know, when he was worse," The reason why was was that when you were worse, it was that when you were worse than the <unk> <unk>.
<unk>, in the world that we live in -- <unk>, <unk> citizens with the <unk> -- the <unk> that we can <unk> is that things are at the <unk>.
You never have to <unk> <unk> because your <unk>, my <unk>, are <unk>.
The <unk> of happiness -- what you're here -- is, "<unk> <unk>" Yes, "you want to."
I mean, small time, I'm really <unk> and my wife is really <unk>.
I couldn't do it better, I didn't have <unk>.
But it doesn't always be a <unk> thing.
I mean, a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> when there is just that kind of <unk> is that when you're not <unk>, and you say, "Why?"
"Who is <unk>?" "" "<unk> is <unk>."
The world is the <unk>. What I could I do?
When there are hundreds of <unk>, and you're going to <unk> a <unk>, and you're going to <unk> who is the <unk>, it's clear that the <unk> you're going to be <unk>.
I could do better.
With hundreds of <unk> available, there are not <unk> for <unk>.
So when people make decisions, even though the result is <unk>, they <unk> <unk> and give them the <unk> to them.
In the last few years, the <unk> is <unk> in the <unk> world.
I think a <unk> <unk> -- not the only, but important -- of this <unk> <unk> is that people have <unk> experiences because the standard are too <unk>.
And when they have to <unk> this situation think that <unk> is their own.
So the final result is that we're better, we're better, <unk>, but we're going to do it.
I'm going to tell you.
This is the <unk> <unk>, what we're going to do for good. It's not true.
There's no <unk> that a little bit of choice is better than <unk>, but by this is not <unk> that much more than a little choice.
There's a <unk> value, <unk>. I don't know what it is.
But I'm sure we've been <unk> by a piece of the level where the <unk> <unk> our life.
Now, from the <unk> <unk> -- I almost finished -- I almost finished -- from the <unk> <unk>, the <unk> is the <unk>.
What allows all this choice in <unk> society is the <unk> material.
There are many places in the world, and you've got <unk> <unk>, where the problem is not that they have <unk>.
The problem is that they have too too <unk>.
So the <unk> I'm talking about is a <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> society.
And what <unk> does and <unk> is this: <unk> <unk> <unk> you talked about the yesterday of how <unk> and <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk>. It's a <unk> of money.
I mean that these choices, <unk> and <unk>, it's not just <unk>.
I'm <unk> <unk>.
They do worse.
If a little bit of what in our society allows <unk> to be <unk> in those where people have too few <unk>, it would not only be their life to be <unk>, but our.
This is what <unk> call a <unk> <unk>.
A <unk> of income income income, all -- not only the poor -- because of this choice in <unk> that we're going to <unk> us.
And then I'm going to end, "<unk>, you can become everything you want to --
<unk>, people of culture, <unk>, "But what do you get that fish?"
"It's <unk> that you can't make any in a glass <unk>."
"A imagination <unk>, a <unk> view of the world --"
And I <unk> it, I <unk> it, at the beginning.
But then, <unk>, instead, I realized that that the fish knows that the long <unk> knows that the long <unk>.
Because the reality is that if you <unk> the <unk>, in the <unk>, so that "all of it is possible," you can't <unk> the freedom.
If you <unk> the <unk> so that it <unk> possible to <unk> the <unk>.
<unk>, and <unk> <unk>.
Everybody need a <unk>.
This is almost certainly too <unk>, maybe even for the fish, and certainly, for us.
