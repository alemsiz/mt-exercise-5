The last year I showed these <unk> for almost three million years, which for almost three million years had the size of the United States <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>.
I'm going to <unk> this <unk> the problem because it doesn't show the ice in the <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> is, in a certain sense, the heart of the global system.
It's <unk> and <unk> in the summer.
The next <unk> will be a <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of the last 25 years.
<unk> <unk> are <unk> in red.
And as you see, it <unk> up to the blue <unk>.
That's the ice in <unk>, which is <unk> summer.
You can see that the <unk> ice <unk>, of five years, it's like the blood, which here <unk> from the body.
It's been in 25 years, so that.
This is a problem because the <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> around the ocean, where there are enormous <unk> of <unk> that, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> from the <unk>.
<unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk>, that amount could <unk>, <unk> this point of not <unk>.
In some <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> is already <unk> by the water.
The <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> with a team <unk> a <unk> <unk> last <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>! <unk>: <unk>: She's good. The question is if we <unk> it.
One reason is that this <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> from the north.
This is a river in <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> never had <unk> <unk>.
This is the <unk> <unk>, in the <unk> of <unk>.
If you want to know how the <unk> <unk> <unk> on the sea level for the <unk> of <unk> on <unk>, here is where the sea.
These <unk> are <unk> <unk>.
<unk> else else than the planet: <unk>, the largest <unk> ice on the planet.
<unk> month, the <unk> scientists that the <unk> of ice <unk> in <unk>, and that the Western <unk>, that <unk> on some <unk> <unk>, which <unk> on some <unk> <unk>,
<unk> at six feet of the <unk> level, like <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk> of ice, you see new <unk>, which a few years ago, they're <unk>.
<unk> percent of the world's population <unk> water from that <unk>.
<unk> <unk>: This is the source of water <unk> of this city.
The <unk> is <unk>.
But when you <unk>, the same happens to the water.
<unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> is <unk> 40 percent.
<unk> <unk> are in the crisis.
<unk>, as you read, they're <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> in the world leads to a <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> are <unk> to a <unk> out of the normal and not <unk>.
<unk> times more <unk> in the last 30 years of the <unk> <unk>.
This is a <unk> of all <unk>.
If you look at it in the <unk> context, they can see the <unk>.
We've been <unk> 70 million <unk> of CO2 every 24 hours of CO2 in the ocean every day.
Look at the <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and on both parts of the <unk> <unk>, where there's a <unk> <unk> of oxygen in the ocean.
The <unk> of global warming, with <unk>, which is 20 percent, is the use of <unk> <unk>.
<unk> is a problem, and <unk> is even worse.
The United States is one of the two countries more emissions, together to China.
And they're trying to build many other <unk> <unk>.
But we're <unk> to a <unk> of direction.
These are the projects <unk> in the last years and some <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
And so, there's a political <unk> in our country.
The <unk> of <unk> and oil <unk> <unk> million dollars in the last year to <unk> <unk> <unk>, which is a <unk>.
I'm going to take something --
<unk> <unk>, in <unk>, where I live, there was a <unk> of <unk> billion <unk> <unk>.
You've seen it on the <unk>.
This is the second largest flow of <unk> in America.
It's success around <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> of one of the <unk> <unk> was this.
<unk>: <unk> ♫ ♫ <unk> <unk> is a <unk> and happy.
It's <unk> here in America, and <unk> our economy.
<unk> the <unk> is more <unk>.
It's <unk>, <unk> and <unk> <unk> it.
<unk>: <unk> is a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The largest <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> is <unk>. This is his <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> <unk>: <unk> <unk> -- Al <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> -- they don't know what they're talking about.
<unk>: So the <unk> for the <unk> of the <unk> has <unk> two <unk>.
This is one of them, a part.
<unk>: <unk>: <unk> we see the <unk> changes as a <unk> <unk> to our business.
So, we're <unk> a lot of money in a <unk> <unk> to make public public and <unk> the truth in <unk>.
It actually is, <unk> is not <unk>.
We think it's <unk> -- it's a good <unk>.
So we don't know about climate change.
We're going to do.
<unk>: <unk> <unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk> -- you've heard a lot.
So we <unk> a <unk> <unk> structure for <unk> for <unk>.
<unk>! <unk> are a little <unk>, but that's the sound of <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> is between the main <unk> of global warming, but the <unk> technology, which you see changes everything.
Let's look at this: this is the <unk> <unk> technology.
<unk>: <unk>, <unk>, the <unk> <unk> to the economic question and the national security.
<unk>: <unk>: America is in the crisis; the economy, national security, the national <unk> crisis.
The <unk> that <unk> all: our <unk> from the <unk> <unk>, like <unk> <unk> and the <unk> oil.
Now, there's a new, <unk> solution to <unk>.
<unk> America: 100 percent of <unk> energy, in 10 years.
A <unk> plan to <unk> America to work, <unk> more <unk>, and to help <unk> global warming.
<unk>, a solution that we try to solve our problems.
<unk> America. <unk> more.
<unk>: This is the last.
<unk>: <unk>: It's about energy to America.
One of the most <unk> ways to <unk> <unk> to <unk> from the <unk> that <unk> our planet.
<unk>: The future is here. <unk>, sun, a new <unk> network.
<unk> <unk> 2: <unk> <unk> for jobs, <unk> <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> America. It's time to be <unk>.
<unk>: A <unk> <unk> <unk> says, "If you want to go to your own.
If you want to go away, you go. "
We have to go away, fast.
Thank you very much.
<unk> year at TED, I did a <unk> on the <unk>.
And they're going to try to <unk> it about how the car works.
So, there. And for those that time, there were no <unk>, the <unk> is the largest scientific experiment that ever <unk> -- <unk> miles of <unk>.
<unk> is to <unk> the conditions that were <unk> less than a <unk> of a second by the beginning of the universe -- to <unk> million times a second.
All of that just <unk>.
This is the <unk> <unk>.
<unk> these <unk> <unk> inside the <unk>.
This is what I work. It's called <unk> -- it's <unk> feet and it has a <unk> <unk>.
This is a <unk> picture of <unk> in building so you can see the <unk>.
The <unk> of the last year we <unk> the car for the first time.
And this picture was <unk> by <unk>.
It was because of <unk> <unk> in control.
It's a picture of the first <unk> particles that he had done all the <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, with a part of the <unk>, and <unk> particles in the <unk>.
In other words, when you <unk> that picture the 10 <unk>, <unk> that the machine is a great <unk>.
I don't know if it was this to <unk> us more or this, when somebody <unk> on Google and <unk> that the page was this.
That means we've had a <unk> impact beyond the scientific impact.
And we had a week later, there was a problem with the car, it had to be <unk> here -- these <unk> <unk>.
These <unk> <unk> <unk> when the car works in the <unk> of the <unk>.
Now, the <unk> between you <unk> the <unk> and <unk>, "It's not true. I'm too <unk>."
And they can do that because when they're very <unk> <unk> <unk>.
So, <unk> degrees <unk>, at a temperature <unk> to the space of the stars, these <unk> can bring that <unk>.
In one of the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> in the <unk>, there was a <unk> <unk>.
So the <unk> <unk> <unk>, and the <unk> <unk> <unk> a electric <unk>.
This was the result.
Now, this is even more <unk> if you think these <unk> <unk> more than 20 <unk>, and that they <unk> about 30 <unk>.
They <unk> about 50 <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, what we did we.
We <unk> them and <unk>.
Now they're all <unk> to their <unk> place.
<unk> the end of <unk> the <unk> will be again.
We <unk> it, and we try to get some data to <unk> or <unk>, and continue so our <unk> to find out what the universe is.
Now, of course, in a certain way, these <unk> <unk> the <unk> of science and engineering engineering <unk>. It's easy to <unk>.
I think the fact that it's so hard, the fact that it's a hard thing to go beyond the <unk>, I think it's the value of things like <unk>.
I'd like to end with the words of a <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, which, <unk>, <unk> <unk> of his <unk> was Michael <unk>, he said, "No," <unk> is so <unk> for the progress of the human mind as the <unk> that the ideas of science are <unk>, that there are no <unk> in nature, that there are no <unk> in nature, that there are no new <unk>, and there are not <unk>.
Thank you.
I want to start <unk> to when, as children, <unk> with <unk>.
<unk> as we <unk> as <unk> and <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>,
The <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> to the way we <unk> most of the world around us.
So, from <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of our <unk> with <unk> objects, together to my <unk> <unk>, and my <unk> <unk> <unk>, and my <unk> <unk> <unk>, and I started <unk>, "And if, when we use a computer, instead of having the <unk> <unk> as the digital <unk> that moves on a <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> an information with both hands,
and <unk> to our <unk>?
The question was so interesting that I thought I was to explore the answer, building <unk>.
In a few words, a <unk> is a <unk> computer <unk> as a <unk>.
In a few words, a <unk> is a <unk> computer <unk> as a <unk>.
You can <unk> them with the hand, they can hear their <unk>, and they have a screen and a screen, and a <unk>.
But <unk>, they're <unk> objects like <unk>, you can just <unk> them.
<unk> are the example of a new <unk> to <unk> the digital information.
And as the <unk> that become more <unk>, <unk> of their own movement, other, and as they become <unk>, as the <unk>, as the <unk>, of the other, of how we <unk> them, we can explore new and <unk> <unk>.
Let's start with some simple example.
This is <unk> to show you about video: if you put it in a direction, the video, the video <unk> so, if you can get it back.
These <unk> <unk> are <unk> of others.
If you <unk> them, they <unk> to what they are going to happen.
If they're <unk>, you know, you can <unk> it a little bit.
If they're <unk>, you know, you can <unk> it a little bit.
We also <unk> their movement and <unk>.
We've then realized that one of the interesting <unk> <unk> was that we could use common <unk> on data, for example, "<unk>" a color like that it was a <unk>.
In this case, we have three <unk> <unk> as a <unk> of <unk> and I can <unk> <unk> to <unk> color in the <unk>, where they <unk>.
and I can <unk> to <unk> the color in the <unk>, where they <unk>.
We <unk> too too, we can <unk> it a little bit.
There are also <unk> possibilities of <unk>, like <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, where people can <unk> the <unk> and <unk>, where people can try things things quickly, and <unk> the results immediately.
Now, I'm --
This is a <unk> sequence that I do with a <unk> program.
Here we have a <unk> of words that is in the middle of <unk> and <unk>.
<unk>, every <unk> <unk> a letter to <unk>, on every <unk>, <unk>, <unk> every <unk> <unk> a letter to <unk>, and as he <unk> <unk> words, he <unk> on a <unk>.
Then, about 30 seconds, you get <unk>, and you have a new <unk> of <unk> and new <unk> <unk>.
Thank you.
So here is a <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk>, I did so that I <unk> them, and I <unk> a video.
They're very <unk>.
And one of the interesting things like this <unk> is that you don't have to give people a lot of <unk>.
I just mean, "<unk> <unk>," and they know exactly what to do.
Here's here, other people that <unk> it.
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk>, there's the right.
It actually wanted to <unk>.
They were just <unk>, for him.
Now, this is a <unk> of a <unk> <unk>.
You could build a <unk> for the <unk> of <unk>. He's <unk>.
It can <unk> new characters in the scene, <unk> their <unk>.
It can <unk> new characters in the scene, <unk> their <unk>.
So, it's going to get the sun.
<unk>: The sun is <unk>.
<unk>: Now he brought a <unk> in the scene.
<unk>: The <unk> <unk>.
<unk> work! <unk>!
So, you <unk> the <unk> and <unk> can <unk> the characters --
<unk>: <unk>!
-- <unk> their story.
<unk>: <unk>!
<unk>: It's a story with the final <unk>, and you can decide how to <unk> it.
<unk>: It's a story with the final <unk>, and you can decide how to <unk> it.
<unk>: <unk>, <unk>.
<unk>: The last example I have time to show you is a recent <unk>, and I <unk> and <unk> music.
It's a <unk>, which is recently, to <unk> and <unk> music.
The <unk> here are <unk> by <unk> as the base, <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> of these four different <unk>, and you can choose what to use.
And you can also <unk> these <unk> in a sequence from <unk> to your <unk>.
And they just <unk> a <unk> of a sound and a sequence.
These are actually that you can control live, like <unk> and <unk>.
I'm going to <unk> it to a particular sound and then <unk> to <unk> it.
And then there are the effects of time as time and <unk>, which is <unk> to the entire sequence.
<unk> like it works.
<unk>: <unk>: <unk> <unk> a <unk> in two <unk>, "<unk>" <unk> "<unk>" <unk> "."
Now, let's look at a bottom.
<unk>: <unk>: Now, <unk> <unk> --
<unk>: <unk>: And now I'm going to <unk> the <unk> to the <unk>, so I can control the effect of the alive.
<unk>: <unk>: I can <unk> the whole sequence <unk> the <unk>, or the other.
<unk>: <unk> now <unk> the <unk> to give the <unk> to the bottom to give you <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> the sequence of the <unk>.
So I don't have to <unk> before, but I can <unk>, <unk>, <unk> more,
And now, finally, I can <unk> the whole sequence on the left <unk> the <unk> "<unk>."
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is to build new <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to how our brain works and body.
And today, I've had time to show you one of the results of this <unk>, and some possibilities we try to bring out of the lab.
The concept I want to <unk> is that's <unk> this new generation of <unk> objects to <unk> media, which <unk> information in our world in our way we want.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the time I'm going to talk to all of you.
I'm a <unk>.
<unk> books is my <unk>, but it's more than this, of course.
It's also the love and the <unk> of my life.
And I don't look like that it can change change.
But, I said, something particular is happened in my life and in my career, which has led me to <unk> the whole relationship with this work.
The particular thing is that I <unk> wrote this book, this <unk> called "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, which, <unk> from my <unk>, for some reason for some reason in the world and <unk> a great <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
And the result is that everywhere I'm going to <unk> now, people <unk> me as if I <unk>.
<unk> -- <unk>, <unk>!
I'm going to come to me to the <unk>, and they say, "Do you not get to do better?
You don't have fear to write all of the life without <unk> to be able to create a book that can <unk> to someone? "
What can you <unk> to someone?
It's <unk>, you know.
But it could go worse, and I remember the most of 20 years ago, when I <unk> to say to people -- I was a <unk> -- that I wanted to be a <unk>.
I'm going to go to the same <unk> <unk> by fear.
And people say, "I don't know I'm not going to be able to have success?
You don't have fear that the <unk> of the <unk>?
You don't have fear to do this <unk> for life, without anything going to come out and to die on a <unk> of <unk> <unk>? "
So, you know.
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is, "Yes."
Yes, I'm fear of all those things.
I always had fear.
And I also fear of many other things that people wouldn't happen.
Like the <unk> and other things <unk>.
But, as I think, and I'm <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> is why?
Is it <unk>?
It's <unk> that anyone who <unk> <unk> to be <unk> by a job that you feel like to do.
But what is so so <unk> in the <unk> <unk> by <unk> <unk> to a <unk> <unk> about health <unk> in a way that other <unk> do not?
How did my father, for example, he was a <unk> <unk> and I don't remember one time in his 40 years of activity in which the <unk> if they were to be <unk> <unk>?
There was never -- that <unk> of <unk> John, how that goes?
<unk>'t you like this, <unk>?
<unk>, engineers as a group <unk>, they don't have of course, in <unk>, <unk> the <unk> of being <unk> <unk>.
We <unk>, we have enough this <unk>, and not only not <unk> but <unk> of all kinds of <unk>, we have this <unk> to be <unk> <unk>.
And they're not going to look at the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that, only in the <unk> century, <unk> young and <unk>, <unk> young people and <unk>.
And even the ones that don't seem to be really <unk> by their <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, before she died, in the last <unk> said, "My book <unk> me a little more <unk> than" a <unk> <unk> about work.
But we didn't know when we <unk> it, because we heard these things so long that somehow we have completely <unk> and <unk> the <unk> that creativity, and <unk> are <unk> that creativity and <unk> are in some ways and that art, at the end, <unk>, <unk> always <unk>.
And the question I want to <unk> all here today is: Do you agree with this idea?
It's good for this thing -- because even <unk> by a <unk> away to me, it's not good for this <unk>.
I think it's <unk>.
And I think it's also <unk> and I don't want to <unk> <unk> in the next century.
I think it's better <unk> our great <unk> to live.
And I certainly know that, in my case -- it would be very <unk> to start <unk> to that <unk> <unk>, <unk> the <unk> that I'm in my career.
<unk> -- <unk>, look, I'm a young, I've been about 40 years.
I still have about four <unk> of work in me.
And it's very <unk> that anything <unk> in the time, then it will be <unk> by the world as the work that I <unk> after I <unk> after the <unk> success of my last book.
<unk> <unk>, because we're all <unk>, <unk> friends here -- is <unk> that my biggest success is to my <unk>.
Oh, <unk>, <unk>!
You know, this is the kind of thought that leads a person to start <unk> at nine <unk> at the nine of the morning, and I don't want to do it.
I'm going to continue to do this work that I love.
So, the question is, how?
And so it seems to me, after many <unk>, that the way to work to continue to write is what we create a <unk> <unk> <unk>, right?
I have to have to some ways to find a distance from between me that I'm <unk>, and the natural <unk> that I'm <unk>, and the natural <unk> that I'm going to go through the time, looking through the time, looking through the time, looking through the time, looking through the <unk>, and trying to find if you have better ideas and more <unk> ideas,
about how to help people <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity.
And that research has led me to the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
<unk> because they <unk> in <unk> and then <unk> back.
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> -- people don't believe that creativity <unk> <unk> from men, OK?
And it turns out that creativity was this spirit <unk> <unk> and <unk> to men from some <unk> <unk> and <unk>, for <unk> reasons and <unk>.
<unk> <unk> these <unk> <unk> of creativity. "<unk>."
<unk>, <unk>, <unk> to have a <unk> that <unk> <unk> from <unk>.
The <unk> were the same idea, but they had the <unk> that kind of spirit without a <unk>.
The <unk>, because the <unk> didn't really know that a <unk> was someone particularly smart.
I thought that a <unk> was this sort of <unk> <unk> that <unk> literally <unk> in the <unk> of a artist, a little bit like the <unk>, and that <unk> out of <unk> the artist, and that <unk> out of <unk> the <unk> of the artist and <unk> the result of that work.
<unk> <unk> <unk>.
And they all thought that was so that they <unk>, right?
So, artists were <unk> by <unk> things, like, for example, too <unk>, right?
If your work work was <unk>, you don't <unk> all of the <unk>, all <unk> that <unk> state of this <unk> <unk>.
If your work <unk>, it wasn't all your <unk>, right?
<unk> that was your <unk> to be a <unk>.
And so people <unk> creativity in <unk> for a long time.
Then the <unk> <unk> and everything <unk>, and <unk> this great idea; we put the human being at the center of the universe above all of the universe and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk>
This was the <unk> principle of <unk> <unk> and people think that creativity is completely <unk> from the <unk>.
And for the first time in the history, it <unk> to <unk> this, or the artist as a <unk> as a person with <unk>.
And I have to <unk>, I think that was a big <unk>.
I think I think of someone, a simple person to believe that they're like a <unk> like the source, the <unk> and the <unk> of all the <unk>, <unk> and <unk> and <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk> is a responsibility to give you human <unk>.
It's like <unk> someone to <unk> the sun.
<unk> and <unk> completely the <unk> and <unk> all these <unk> on the <unk>.
And I think it's been the pressure to <unk> artists in the <unk> 500 years.
And, if that is true, and I think it's true, the question, is the question, is the question now?
Can we do that?
<unk> to go back to a more <unk> than the relationship between human and <unk> <unk>.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we can't <unk> 500 years of thinking in a 18 minutes.
And there's probably people in the audience who <unk> <unk> <unk> on their <unk>, <unk>, you make the <unk> of people <unk> on their projects.
You probably don't <unk> all about this thing.
But the question I want to ask you is -- why not?
Why don't we <unk> in this way?
Because it makes more sense of anything else that I've ever heard to explain the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> process.
One process that, as anyone ever <unk> to do something -- so, basically, all here -- knows, it's <unk>, it's not <unk>.
And, in fact, it can sometimes seem <unk>.
I did this meeting <unk> with the extraordinary <unk> <unk>, which has now 90 years now, but that was a <unk> for life and said that during his <unk> in the <unk> <unk>, <unk> out in the <unk> <unk>, <unk> out in the <unk> <unk>, and <unk>, inside, when a <unk> <unk> from the <unk>.
And he said that he was like a <unk> <unk>.
And that <unk> <unk> to her from the <unk>.
I <unk> it, because he was <unk> the ground under his feet.
I thought I had one thing to do to do that point and was, words, "<unk> as a <unk>."
And so he went to home and he came from this <unk>, and it wouldn't have to be someone that take a piece of paper and a <unk> enough <unk>, and a <unk> <unk> on the page.
<unk> times not <unk> to be enough fast, so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> without able to get to the house and the <unk> through the <unk>, and the <unk> <unk> through the <unk>, looking, as she said, "another <unk>."
Then there were those times -- this piece of <unk> never -- there were the moments that almost <unk>, right?
So, he was coming home and he was looking for the paper and the <unk> through, and he <unk> a <unk> just in the while he was <unk>, and he was, that was as if you <unk> with the other hand and <unk> it.
<unk> the <unk> from the tail and the <unk> in his body and the <unk> on the page.
And in these cases, the <unk> would be <unk> on the <unk> page and <unk>, but in the last word to the first.
So when you <unk> it <unk> -- it's <unk>, it's exactly <unk> to my <unk> process.
Not all my <unk> process -- I'm not a <unk>!
I'm a <unk>, and my way of <unk> is; it <unk> at the same <unk> every day and <unk> and <unk> and work on top.
But even I had, in my <unk>, I <unk> against that thing, sometimes.
And I think that even many of you the <unk>.
You know, even though the job and the ideas <unk> me to be <unk> by a certain source, I couldn't <unk> <unk>.
And what is this thing?
And how can we <unk> it so that we don't lose your head, but rather, that <unk> <unk> us?
And as it is about, the best example I have is the <unk> <unk> <unk>, which I've <unk> several years ago for a <unk>.
I'm talking about this, and you know, <unk>, for the <unk> of life has been the <unk> of the artist <unk> <unk>, trying to control, <unk> these <unk> species of totally <unk>.
But then <unk>, he <unk>, and one day while he was <unk> on a <unk> <unk>, he <unk> everything.
<unk> <unk>, and all of a <unk> this <unk> <unk>, which comes into his head as the <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, and <unk>, and the <unk>, and the <unk>, and the <unk>, but it doesn't know how to <unk>.
It's not a piece of paper, it doesn't have a <unk>.
So it starts to feel this kind of old <unk> <unk> in him like, "I'm going to lose, and <unk> <unk> from this song.
I'm not enough <unk> and I can't <unk>. "
And instead of going to go to the <unk>, they <unk>.
<unk> the whole process of <unk> and made something completely new.
I just <unk> the sky and said, "<unk>, you see that I'm <unk>?"
"It seems to you that can write a song now?
If you really want to <unk>, <unk> at a more <unk> when I can <unk> care about you.
<unk>, <unk> to <unk> more more.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. "
And his <unk> process <unk> after this.
Not the work, the job was still <unk> as always.
But the process, and the <unk> <unk> that <unk> was <unk> when he <unk> the <unk>, the <unk> that came out of the <unk> that the problems and <unk> it back from where, he was <unk> that it didn't have to be something <unk> and <unk>.
but I <unk> this <unk>, <unk> <unk> a conversation between <unk> and this <unk> thing that <unk> and <unk>, but it wasn't <unk>.
So, how I <unk> that story to change a little bit of the way I <unk> and already <unk> me once.
This idea, I <unk> when I was <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and I <unk> in one of the <unk> that we all <unk> when we're working on something and you can't think it's going to be a <unk>, that's going to be a <unk>, that's going to be the <unk>, which is going to be the <unk>, that's going to be the book.
Not just <unk>, just <unk> the book written.
And we started thinking about <unk> this project.
But then I'm going to <unk> that I <unk> to <unk> the air and <unk>.
So I <unk> my face on the <unk> and <unk> my face to a <unk> and <unk> my <unk> to a <unk> <unk> of the room.
And I said <unk>, "<unk>, what," <unk>, what, we know that if this book is not going to be <unk>, right?
Because as you see, I'm <unk> everything I have, I don't have more about this.
So if you want it to be better, you have to <unk> and do your part.
OK. But if you don't do it, you know what, I don't know.
I started to write the same because it's my job.
And I would like to say that I'm <unk> to do my <unk> today to do my part. "Because at the end is so, OK -- <unk> it's in the North Africa people <unk> to the <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the moon, and <unk> music that <unk> for hours and <unk> to <unk>.
And they were always <unk>, because the <unk> were <unk> and <unk>.
But every so much, <unk>, something <unk>, and one of these <unk> artists actually <unk>.
And I know, you know what I'm talking, because I know you've seen, at a certain point, a <unk> like this.
It was as if the time <unk>, and the <unk> <unk> through a kind of <unk> and he was not doing anything different from the usually, like the <unk> <unk>, but everything <unk>.
And suddenly, they don't just <unk> as a human.
But it <unk> from the <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk>.
And when this <unk>, people <unk> what he was, he <unk> him with his name.
<unk> your hands and <unk> to <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, God," God, "God,"
That's God, you know.
<unk> <unk> <unk> -- when the <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the <unk>, <unk> this <unk> with them and the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, which you can still feel in the <unk> or in the <unk>.
In <unk>, when a artist has done something impossible and <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>," <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>, <unk> -- a <unk> of God.
And it's because we need to be a <unk>.
But, the problem comes up the next day, when you <unk> and <unk> that are the <unk> <unk> and <unk> that are the 11 <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> of God is no longer there.
It's just a <unk> with great <unk> to <unk>, and perhaps never <unk> to <unk> that <unk>.
And maybe nobody <unk> the name of God still, as <unk> <unk>, and what does it have to do with the rest of his life?
It's hard.
This is one of the <unk> <unk> to do in a <unk> life.
But perhaps it doesn't have to be so <unk> if you can't believe, you know, the most <unk> of your being being from yourself.
But I just <unk> that you have data in the <unk> from a source of this <unk> part of your life that you have to go to <unk>, when you're finished.
And, you know, if we think about it in this way it changes.
And so I started <unk>, and it's <unk> like I <unk> for several months during the <unk> of the book that I was going to <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> of my success.
And what I must continue to <unk> when I feel <unk> from this is, I'm not afraid.
You don't <unk>. <unk> only your job.
<unk> <unk> for your <unk>, any of it can be.
If your job is <unk>, <unk>.
If the <unk>, <unk> <unk> to you <unk> <unk> <unk> some kind of <unk>, for one moment through your <unk>, "<unk>!"
<unk>, you do the same your <unk>.
And <unk>! "<unk>!" <unk>, "<unk>.
I think it's <unk>.
"<unk>!" <unk> "<unk>," <unk>, "<unk>" <unk> "<unk>" <unk> "<unk>" <unk> "<unk>". "
Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk>: <unk>!
And as you know, I've been talking about some of these projects on the human genome, what can <unk> and about the discovery of new genes.
We're <unk> a new way: we started <unk> the biology and start <unk> biology and now starting from that digital code, we're <unk> in a new <unk> of biology, <unk> and <unk> life.
We always tried to make great questions.
"What is life?" It's something that many <unk> have been <unk> to figure out at levels.
We tried different <unk>, <unk> to the <unk> terms.
We're <unk> for almost 20 years.
When we <unk> the human genome <unk> to go from the <unk> world of biology to the digital world.
Now we're going to <unk> the life, or create new life from this digital universe?
This is a map of a little <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, which is the <unk> species from the <unk> genome between those that can <unk> into the lab.
And we tried to <unk> <unk> the genome to <unk> one even smaller.
We can be able to <unk> a <unk> of genes about 500 that are here.
But when we look at the <unk> map, it's <unk> simple than our.
<unk>, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can <unk>, one at the time, it's very <unk> that this can bring to a <unk> cell.
So I thought the only way to <unk> was <unk> this <unk> so that we <unk> the <unk> to <unk> some of these questions.
And so we started the <unk> of the "<unk>," Can we <unk> a <unk>? "
Can the chemistry <unk> of making these great molecules that we never have been able to create these big molecules that we never have to create these before?
And, in <unk>, we can make a <unk>?
A <unk> is just a piece of <unk> material.
The speed with which we're able to <unk> life is <unk> to <unk> <unk>.
Our ability to write the <unk> code, instead, it <unk> rather slowly, but it's <unk>.
And our <unk> results, the <unk> <unk> on a <unk>.
We've <unk> over 15 years ago.
The process has <unk> a lot of <unk>, <unk> with a <unk> <unk> before <unk> experiments.
But we've discovered that <unk> is very hard.
There are <unk> of thousands of cars in the world that <unk> little <unk> of DNA, <unk> of 30 to 50 <unk> and it's a <unk> process. The more than the <unk> is along, the <unk> there are.
So we had to develop a new <unk> to <unk> these <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
And this was our first <unk>, starting from information digital <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's a little virus that <unk> bacteria.
We designed the <unk>, <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> a DNA <unk> about <unk> <unk>.
The interesting thing is when we took this piece of <unk> material <unk> and we <unk> it in the bacteria, the bacteria have <unk> to read this code and <unk> particles.
The <unk> particles are <unk> by cells, are <unk> back and they <unk> the <unk> <unk>.
I've been talking about recently with <unk> members of the <unk> industry that they certainly <unk> this model.
They have more than you.
And we think that this is a situation where software can actually build its own <unk> in a <unk> system.
But we wanted to do the biggest things in the <unk>.
You could build the whole <unk> of the <unk>.
They're more than <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> code.
So we thought we're going to <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> of the virus, so that we can change the <unk> of a cell.
The <unk> is <unk>, and if you <unk> information in a computer, these must be very <unk>.
When you <unk> this genome for the first time in <unk> the <unk> <unk>, it was a <unk> for every 10 <unk> <unk>.
We've discovered, <unk>, 30 <unk>. If we used that original sequence never <unk> to be able to do that.
One part of the process is to design <unk> 50 <unk> that <unk> with all the other <unk> of the other <unk> of the <unk> of the other <unk> of them to build smaller smaller smaller than <unk> together.
<unk> elements here.
You've probably read that <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>: We have a <unk> code on four <unk>: A, <unk>, <unk> and <unk>
<unk> of those <unk> <unk> together, about 20 <unk>, and there's a <unk> order for every <unk>.
So we can use the code for <unk> words, <unk>, <unk>.
What we did we do at the beginning was <unk>.
Some of them were <unk> by the fact that it wasn't <unk>.
We designed these <unk> to <unk> just <unk> with <unk>.
There are <unk> that <unk> them and <unk> them.
And we started <unk> <unk>, <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> so that they <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to them.
But anyway, we've made these <unk> in <unk> so that we're <unk> to create a <unk> <unk> that we're <unk> to create a very <unk> <unk> as you'll see in a minute.
We're trying to <unk> the process.
So, this seems the <unk> of a <unk> <unk>.
When you get to these very <unk>, very <unk>, more than 100 <unk> <unk>, you don't get <unk> to the <unk> <unk>.
You get to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> biology.
So we've <unk> other <unk>.
<unk> of another <unk> called <unk> <unk>, which is <unk> <unk>, which is <unk> to <unk> the DNA.
So here's an example.
This <unk>, called the <unk> <unk>, can <unk> three million <unk> <unk>.
You can see in the <unk> <unk> like his <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's about 12 hours, <unk> exactly as it was before.
<unk> thousands of organisms that are able to do that.
These organisms can <unk> completely <unk>.
We're going to live under <unk>.
I'm absolutely absolutely sure that life <unk> in space, and you <unk> to find new <unk> of water <unk>.
Actually, NASA showed that this is happening.
This is a picture of the <unk> that we built using these <unk>, just by using the <unk> with the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This is not <unk> with a <unk> <unk>, but with a <unk> <unk>.
It's a <unk> so big that we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk>.
These are pictures that <unk> a period of about six seconds.
This is the <unk> that we've done a little time ago.
They're more than <unk> <unk> <unk> code.
It's the largest <unk> of a <unk> structure that's ever <unk> by man.
It's got a <unk> <unk>.
If you <unk> it with a 10 <unk> without spaces, we're just <unk> pages to <unk> this code.
Now, how do we work? How can we <unk>?
<unk>, by a virus is a game game.
It's a little more <unk> when you use of bacteria.
It's more simple when it comes to the <unk> cells like our -- you just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> another, which is basically the process of <unk>.
In <unk>, the <unk> <unk> is instead <unk> inside the cell, but we <unk> <unk> that we're able to do a <unk> <unk> of a cell to another cell to another cell and <unk>.
We <unk> a <unk> <unk> from a species.
<unk> are different as as the <unk> men.
We <unk> some <unk> in a way that we can decide which to choose that <unk> for this <unk>.
And then he <unk> it with <unk> <unk> all the <unk>.
And when we put it in the cell, it was <unk>, and <unk> our <unk> the new <unk>, <unk> the new <unk> went into the cell.
And we wanted to say that we don't go beyond, but we tried to <unk> more in there.
This is one of the biggest <unk> of evolution.
We found that <unk> species have <unk> a second or a third <unk> somewhere, <unk>, <unk> in a second, a thousand new <unk> to that species.
So who think about evolution as a <unk> at the time, it <unk> doesn't have a lot of biology.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> that was in the cell, they didn't <unk> one.
The <unk> <unk> that we <unk> it.
It's <unk>, and it <unk> the other <unk> like <unk>, has <unk> the other <unk> like <unk>, and we <unk> with only the cell and the new <unk>.
It's become blue because of the genes we <unk>.
And in a short time, all the <unk> of a kind of <unk>, you go <unk>, and it <unk> of all in a new species, <unk> on the new software that we <unk> in the cell.
All the <unk> are <unk>, and the <unk> are <unk>, and when you <unk> the <unk> code exactly what we've <unk>.
Now, this may seem <unk> <unk>, but we can change the software things in a pretty <unk> way.
Now, I've already <unk> that you don't talk about <unk> -- but of progress at three million years and a half years of evolution, and I've already said that maybe we're going to create a new version of <unk> in which we <unk> new species on this digital process.
Why do that?
I think it's pretty <unk> when we think of our <unk>.
We're going to go from six billion and a half billion people in the next 40 years.
Just to give a example: I was born in <unk>.
Now there are three people on the planet to <unk> in <unk>; in 40 years, there will be four years.
We're <unk> problems now to find food, water and <unk>, <unk> and <unk> and <unk> for six billion and a half of people.
We're going to be more <unk> to do it for nine billion.
<unk> more than five billion <unk>, more than 30 billion <unk>.
That means 100 million <unk> a day.
When we try to find <unk> <unk>, or any kind of process to <unk>, it will be a huge challenge.
<unk> we have to realize all the <unk> of CO2 from these materials that <unk> in the atmosphere.
At the day, with the <unk> <unk> in the world, we have a <unk> with about 20 million genes, and I like think that are the <unk> <unk> for the future.
The <unk> industry only a <unk> <unk>, and think of how many different things are <unk> out.
Our <unk> is data <unk> from the reality of <unk> and our imagination.
We now have <unk>, because of these <unk> <unk>, able to create what we call the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We can make a big robot that can produce a big robot that can produce a million <unk> a day.
Think of these 20 million genes or <unk> to try to <unk> the <unk> to make <unk> or <unk>, new <unk>, we can change, with a small team, and create more <unk> biology, and create more <unk> biology than the last 20 years of science.
And it's just a standard <unk>.
We can choose to <unk>, <unk> chemistry, <unk> <unk>, chemistry, <unk> <unk>.
This is a <unk> of some some <unk> software that we're working on to be able to <unk> and design species to the computer.
Well, we don't know how they will they be.
We know exactly how their <unk> is their <unk> code.
We're <unk> on the <unk> generation.
You also see that you <unk> from the <unk> was a <unk> experiment.
We <unk> <unk> <unk> and third generation that we <unk> enough to be <unk> as <unk> as the <unk> or <unk> different kinds of <unk>.
But the only way that biology can have a great impact without <unk> <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the <unk> would be <unk> of CO2, and we think we're working for design cells that can reach reach to be the first <unk> of <unk> in about 18 months.
<unk> <unk> with CO2 is a <unk>, but in our <unk> <unk> in our <unk> of the world, we found different <unk>.
This is a <unk> that we <unk> in <unk>.
<unk> in the deep ocean, about <unk> meters <unk> at <unk> <unk> of water.
<unk> <unk> from CO2 using hydrogen <unk> as a source of energy.
We're trying to figure out if we can <unk> CO2, which can easily be <unk> by <unk>, <unk> that process.
So, we think that we might be able to <unk> what the basic question, "which is the basic question," What is life "is, we, we have the <unk> goal of <unk> the whole industry.
<unk>. If you can't do that from TED, where can you?
We're going to be a <unk> <unk>.
And also, we're working for the same <unk> to create <unk>.
You've seen this year with flu, we're always back a year and with a dollar less when you get to find the right <unk>.
I think what you can change by building <unk> <unk>.
That's how the future might start looking <unk>, now, the tree of evolution, <unk> the evolution with bacteria, <unk>, <unk> cells.
We're so much to <unk> people.
Our goal is to make a way to live enough to try to <unk> them. Thank you very much.
First of all, I'm going to show you, the <unk>, some fundamental work of the new technology that we brought the <unk> <unk> to a <unk> almost a year ago. This is <unk>.
It's a <unk> in which you can <unk> is at local level that you can <unk> a huge amount of data.
Here we're seeing <unk> <unk> pictures of <unk> with a kind of <unk> <unk> and <unk>, for a fast <unk>, <unk> the images like we want.
And it doesn't matter how big the amount of information that we see, how big these <unk> are of data, or images.
Most of them are common <unk> photographs, but this is a <unk> <unk> from the <unk> <unk>, and <unk> in the <unk> <unk>.
It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that <unk> the <unk> of a system like this is the number of <unk> on your screen at any time. It's also a very <unk> architecture.
This is a whole book, which is not about images.
This is the <unk> <unk> <unk>. Every <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk>.
And to <unk> that it's a <unk> and not of images, we can do something like this, to really see that it's about a real <unk>, not a picture.
It may be a little <unk> way to read a <unk> book.
I don't <unk> it.
This is a <unk> example. This is a <unk> number.
Every big picture is the beginning of a <unk>.
And it really gives you the beautiful experience and the beautiful experience of reading the real version of a <unk>, which is for nature a <unk> of a <unk>.
We also did something with the <unk> of this particular number of the 99.
We created a <unk> <unk> much more than that you use in a normal <unk>, and we <unk> the <unk> content.
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk>, you can see here.
Or some <unk>, or even the <unk> <unk>.
And that really <unk> some of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of space on the screen.
I think that this <unk> <unk> to the <unk> and other <unk> similar, you don't have to be <unk>.
<unk>, the <unk> is one of the most <unk> <unk> for this kind of technology.
And on this, I don't want to lose time, if not to say we have <unk> to give you a <unk> in this field.
These are all the streets in the United States <unk> above a NASA <unk>.
So now we're going to do something else.
This is actually live on the web; you can go and see.
It's a project called <unk>, which is two different technologies.
One is <unk> and the other is a <unk> <unk> computer that's very interesting computer that's done by <unk> <unk>, a student of the <unk> of Washington, with the help of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And it's alive on the web, <unk> by <unk>.
You can <unk> when we do this kind of <unk>, where we can go from a picture to the other and have this kind of experience of <unk>.
But the <unk> <unk> of images here actually actually actually,
The <unk> <unk> of the computer have <unk> these images together, so that they <unk> to the <unk> <unk> all <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> have been <unk>. Here you see the elements of a <unk>, or <unk>, and these things are all <unk> at the <unk>.
I don't know if I have time to show you some other environment.
There are some much more <unk>.
I want to spend directly to one of the <unk> of <unk> data, and this <unk> from a <unk> <unk> of <unk> that we've done for the first time, to show you what <unk> is really the key behind this technology, the <unk> technology. And it's not <unk> as <unk> the <unk> that we put in the website.
We had to <unk> some <unk> <unk> and <unk>.
This is a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> images. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> images of kinds of <unk> in <unk>, other <unk> and <unk> and <unk> images of the kind of a picture that's discovery <unk> to this model.
So, they're all <unk> images and you've been all <unk> at the <unk> level like this.
And it's possible to be <unk> in this <unk> way.
You know, I never thought I end up to work for <unk>.
It's very <unk> to <unk> this kind of <unk> here.
I think we'll see that it's a lot of different kinds of <unk>: from the <unk> to those <unk> <unk>, a <unk> number, a <unk> number of <unk>, <unk> together in this environment.
And if I can, I can try and look at the <unk> those <unk>.
Many people are <unk> by <unk>, etc.
<unk> here is a series of photographs -- <unk>. <unk>.
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We can go from the <unk> to the physics of this environment.
The <unk> point is that we can do things with social environment. This is <unk> data from the whole memory of how to <unk> the land, from the whole memory of <unk>, and <unk> all that data together.
All those pictures become <unk> together, more than the <unk> parts.
You have a model of the entire <unk>.
Think about this as the <unk> of the work of <unk> <unk> on Earth.
It's something that's <unk> in complexity as people <unk>, and the <unk> that they <unk> to <unk> it with the use.
Their pictures are <unk> with <unk> <unk> by other people.
If someone comes the idea of <unk> all these <unk> <unk> the name, my <unk> picture, my <unk> picture of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> all of that data, and I can use it as a <unk> <unk> <unk> in that space, in that <unk>, using the <unk> of <unk>, using the pictures of anyone, and have a social experience, <unk>.
<unk>, a <unk> of all that are <unk> very <unk> models of every interesting part of the Earth, <unk> not only by <unk> <unk> and images and <unk>, but from <unk> <unk> and <unk>, but from memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I understood? What's good your software <unk> us to do is that at some point, in the next years, all the photographs <unk> from anyone in the world's world going to be <unk> together with all the <unk> world. <unk> will be <unk> together?
<unk>: Yes. What's doing is basically <unk>.
It's creating <unk>, if you want, you want, between images.
And it's doing it in the <unk> content.
The thing becomes very interesting if you think of the <unk> information that many of these images are <unk>.
As you do a <unk> of images on the web, it <unk> a <unk> and the <unk> on the Web page has a lot of information about images.
Now, what happens if that picture <unk> to all your picture?
So the amount of <unk> <unk> and the amount of <unk> that's <unk> is very enormous. It's a <unk> effect of the network.
CA: <unk>, it's really amazing. <unk>.
<unk>: I'm going to <unk> you.
One of the main <unk> when you <unk> and one of the <unk> research is the to live in the <unk>, who didn't <unk> the <unk> <unk>, who <unk> the past the wind, the <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk>, the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of plants.
We think that <unk> <unk> still <unk> <unk>, or that the <unk> <unk> <unk>, or the <unk> <unk> <unk>, or that <unk> <unk>, or <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and that the idea that the world in which the idea that the world in which we don't exist in a sense, but it's only a model of reality, and that the idea that the world in which we don't live in a sense, but it's only a model,
the <unk> of a particular <unk> of <unk> choices that our <unk> has done, good or bad, a lot of <unk> it.
And, of course, all the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>. <unk>.
We're <unk> to <unk>.
We have to deal with the <unk> of death <unk>, so we don't <unk> if we <unk> and <unk> --
We all have a art.
What <unk> is the <unk> of the song, the <unk> of the <unk> of every culture.
It doesn't matter that they're the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, or the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, or the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, or a <unk> in the heart of <unk>.
He was my <unk> of the journey of the <unk> a month ago, or a <unk> of <unk> in the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk> mother of the world.
All these <unk> <unk> that there are other ways of thinking, other ways of thinking, other ways of to move in the world.
And if you take a moment, it's a concept that can give you hope.
<unk>, the <unk> of the world create a <unk> life and <unk> that <unk> the planet, and it's important for the <unk> of the planet as the <unk> <unk>.
And you can think of this <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and you can <unk> the <unk> the <unk> of all the <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, ideas, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, ideas, <unk>, <unk>, dreams, ideas, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, ideas, <unk>, <unk>, ideas, <unk>, dreams, ideas, <unk>, <unk>, dreams, ideas, <unk>, ideas, <unk>, dreams, <unk>, ideas, <unk>, dreams, dreams, <unk>, <unk>, dreams, ideas, ideas, ideas, <unk>, <unk>, ideas
The <unk> is the great <unk> of humanity.
It's the <unk> of what we are and what we can be as as a <unk> species.
And <unk> the <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, for example, <unk> that 50 percent of all species has been or is on the <unk> of <unk> because it's <unk>, or <unk> -- the <unk> of the <unk> diversity -- and you don't even <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> -- that's the <unk> of diversity.
The <unk> of all that is, of course, the <unk> <unk>.
When you're <unk> <unk> <unk> on this planet.
A <unk> is not only <unk> by a <unk> or a <unk> of <unk> rules.
A <unk> is the <unk> of the human spirit.
It's the way that the <unk> of every culture <unk> <unk> into the material world.
Every language is a forest of the mind, a <unk>, a <unk>, a <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
And the <unk> <unk>, as we are sitting here in <unk>, at least half the <unk> is <unk> in the <unk> of children.
They don't get <unk> to children, which means less than something, which is, unless you know, that are death.
What's more <unk> than being <unk> by the <unk>, of being the last one of being <unk>, the last one that you don't have a way to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> or <unk> the kids?
This <unk> <unk> has been the <unk> of someone in the world every two weeks, every two weeks, a <unk> <unk> and <unk> with itself in the <unk> <unk> of a <unk> language.
And I know that somebody of you say, "<unk>'t that better?
The world wouldn't be a better place if we all know the same language? "<unk>, then we all <unk>. <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>.
<unk> of a <unk> thing, which means not to talk about their own <unk>.
I'd like to give you a journey through the <unk> --
a little journey in the <unk> to give you a <unk> of what we're <unk>.
Many of us <unk> that when I say, "different ways of <unk>," I mean, "I really mean," I mean, "I really mean," I really think that when I say, "different ways of <unk>.
<unk> for example, this <unk> <unk>, in <unk> <unk>, the <unk> of the <unk>, which <unk> <unk> to the <unk> <unk> from the <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk>.
It's a <unk> that's not able to <unk> the blue color from green because the <unk> <unk> is <unk> in the <unk>, where the <unk> is <unk>.
They have a <unk> language and a <unk> rule, <unk> <unk>, "<unk>" <unk> ": you have to <unk> a different language.
All of this has <unk> in the past <unk>, though the <unk> is that in these <unk> families, where you're talking about six or seven <unk> because of the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
You go and listen to and then talk to you.
I <unk> one of the most interesting <unk> I've lived, the <unk> <unk> <unk>, an incredible <unk> that had the first <unk> in <unk>.
In <unk>, they <unk> a <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk>.
They made <unk> by the top photographs that <unk> them in the <unk> that <unk> <unk>, <unk> that this <unk> forest forest <unk> never had seen anything <unk>.
They <unk> the picture from the ground, <unk> to the <unk> of a form or a <unk> and, not <unk> anything, they <unk> that they <unk> <unk> <unk>, and they <unk> the five <unk> with the <unk>.
But the <unk> don't just <unk> the <unk>.
They <unk> between them.
<unk> percent of the <unk> <unk> was <unk> by their own.
We're <unk> at eight <unk> and we found two <unk> of death, and when we <unk> to know, they <unk> that one of them was <unk> so that he died <unk>, and then the same. [[<unk>]], they <unk>, they had a <unk> <unk> in the forest.
The <unk> were able to recognize the animal <unk> from 40 <unk> and <unk> the species.
<unk> years early '<unk>, it was <unk> a very interesting task when my <unk> of <unk> <unk>, if I wanted to go to <unk> between the <unk> society <unk> at the base of the <unk> <unk> and <unk>, and <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, and <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>, and <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, and <unk> of the <unk> <unk>.
And to make sense of <unk>, I should have understanding the <unk> culture and that the <unk> is not <unk> <unk>.
It's pretty much of a <unk> <unk> vision of the world.
<unk> interesting.
If you try to <unk> the great <unk> of the world <unk>, what would you like?
<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, etc.
A continent comes out, thinking that <unk> Africa doesn't have <unk> <unk>. And instead, the <unk> is not <unk>. And instead, the <unk> is not else that the <unk> of these <unk> <unk> very <unk> during the <unk> <unk>.
What makes interesting is the <unk> of the <unk> of life and death.
So <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> can be <unk> by the <unk> <unk>, <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the alive in such a short moment the <unk> becomes the <unk>.
So, the <unk> <unk>, "<unk>, you go to <unk> to talk about God.
We <unk> in the <unk> and <unk> God. "
And since you're <unk>, is the spirit that you're <unk>, how can you get <unk>?
So, they <unk> to these incredible events: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> of the power of mind when it's <unk> in a state of <unk>.
I <unk> all the <unk> that I lived the <unk> <unk> are the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, in the <unk> <unk>.
<unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, which once <unk> on the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk>.
In a blood continent <unk> of blood, this <unk> never been <unk> by the <unk>.
In <unk>, I'm <unk> by a <unk>, but their education is extraordinary <unk>.
<unk> <unk> are <unk> away from families to three or four years, and they live in a world <unk> and <unk> in a world of <unk> and <unk> <unk> for 18 years.
Two years of nine years <unk> of nine years from the nine years of <unk> that <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
For this time, they're <unk> to the values of their society, values that <unk> their <unk> and just <unk> their <unk> <unk>, or to <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or to say the <unk> <unk>.
At the <unk> of this incredible <unk>, they're <unk> out and for the first time in their life, they see a <unk>. And in that moment of the first <unk>, when the sun <unk> <unk> <unk>, everything that they learned in theory of the first <unk>, when the sun <unk> <unk>, everything that they learned in the <unk> theory, <unk> <unk> <unk>, everything that they learned in the <unk>. The <unk> does a <unk> it <unk> it's <unk>. The <unk> <unk> back,
"<unk>? I said how I said.
It's <unk>. Now it's about you.
They call the <unk> <unk> and say that we, <unk> <unk>, we are the <unk> of the world's <unk>.
This is extremely important.
When we think of the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> environment, <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk>, which is a <unk> concept in his <unk>, or maybe <unk> and say that these <unk> are <unk> to the Earth.
<unk> <unk> are not <unk> or <unk> <unk> from the <unk>.
There is no space for these things in the <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk>, but because of the time and <unk>, have created a <unk> of the Earth <unk> <unk>, <unk> a <unk> of Earth <unk>, it's <unk> <unk>. It's a <unk> <unk>, the concept that the Earth can only to live because it is <unk> by human consciousness.
What does that mean?
I mean that a <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> <unk> the mountain is a <unk> spirit that <unk> its <unk> will be a human being <unk> different and will have a very different <unk> and will have a <unk> different relationship with the mountain or the place, which <unk> that <unk> a mountain is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> to be <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk>.
What's interesting is the <unk> that <unk> the relationship between the <unk> and the natural world.
I grew up in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that the <unk> <unk> to be <unk>.
That made me a human being different from my friends who believe that <unk> are the <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> that live in the <unk> <unk>, <unk> that <unk> during the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
If we try to <unk> that these <unk> can create reality, <unk> to start understanding some <unk> of their <unk>. They're going to be this <unk>.
I <unk> this picture in the <unk> <unk>.
Maybe some of you have heard about <unk>, the most powerful <unk> of the <unk> <unk>.
What makes the <unk> is not the potential <unk> of <unk>, but his <unk>. It's <unk> by two elements.
On the one hand, this <unk> <unk> a series of <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
<unk> the only <unk> has a <unk> that <unk> a little bit of the <unk>, but it's <unk> with the <unk> of a <unk>'s family <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This <unk> <unk> <unk>, very similar to the <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
If you're going to see the <unk> <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, which is <unk> <unk>.
It <unk> that <unk> on the <unk> is a little like being <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a sea of electricity. <unk>'t make a <unk> of reality; it makes the <unk> of reality.
I often <unk> with my <unk>, Richard <unk> <unk>, the man who <unk> the <unk> was <unk>, with his discovery of the <unk> <unk> in the '<unk>.
<unk> my <unk> you can't <unk> these <unk> as <unk> because if you can't tell anybody to be <unk>. [<unk>] <unk>, but they're <unk>, but they're <unk> by a <unk> that's <unk>, of course in <unk>, <unk>.
It's possible to be <unk> <unk> if you <unk> with other <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk>.
Now, the <unk> that are in this <unk> are <unk>, the same kind of <unk>, the same kind of necessary for <unk> <unk>. The question <unk> <unk>: in a <unk> of <unk> species of plants, how these <unk> <unk> to <unk> two <unk>, they make <unk> <unk> two <unk>, they make <unk> <unk> <unk>, but that if you <unk> in this way, they create a <unk> <unk>, they create a <unk> version that's
We use the great <unk> of <unk> and <unk>, which can <unk> <unk>.
But if we <unk> to the <unk>, we <unk> "The plants are talking about."
What does that mean?
This <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, which <unk> <unk> in the forest, and that our eyes <unk> in the forest itself.
If the <unk> like <unk> their <unk>, they <unk> us, "<unk>" <unk> "<unk>" <unk> "<unk>" <unk>. "I said," No. "
The solution is: You take the <unk> <unk> in a night night, <unk> full of the moon and <unk> with a different <unk>.
With this one of this is not going to <unk>, but it's much more interesting than <unk> the <unk>.
Now, the problem is that even the ones that have the heart of us who have the heart <unk> <unk> them, but somehow <unk> to the <unk> of the history of <unk> as the real world as well as we think of the real world, and <unk> beyond.
In fact, the <unk> century, by 300 years, <unk>, not <unk> for its <unk> or his <unk> <unk>, but rather like the one of the was that we <unk> and <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> diversity and <unk> and <unk> the planet. Now the problem is not the change.
All the <unk> through the <unk> have been <unk> in a <unk> for new possibilities.
And the problem is not technology.
The <unk> <unk> have no <unk> to be <unk> when they put <unk> <unk> and <unk> as the <unk> don't have <unk> to be <unk> when they put <unk> <unk> and <unk>.
It's not the change or technology that <unk> the <unk> of <unk>. It's the power.
The <unk> <unk> of the <unk>.
And if you look at the world, you know, they're not <unk> to <unk>.
They're <unk> creatures and <unk> out of the existence of <unk> forces that go beyond their <unk> <unk>.
<unk> that <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> --
a <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk>, a <unk> that has been <unk> free in the forest to a generation of the <unk>, and <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk>, where you can see the <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> that seems to <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>,
We're going to <unk> the <unk> with the <unk> <unk> to the forest.
Or, in <unk>, the <unk>, the diseases that are <unk> with the <unk> discovery of <unk>.
If you <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk>, where I'm doing a lot of research, you'll see the <unk> of the political <unk>.
As a <unk> <unk>, the <unk> physics of a <unk>, it's <unk> to the <unk> level, but the <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, not only is it, but <unk> <unk> in certain <unk>, because it's part of the development of <unk>.
And you can't understand the <unk> of the <unk>, until you go away from the beginning.
I <unk> <unk> miles from <unk> in the Western China through the <unk> <unk>, <unk> with a young <unk>, but only got to <unk> with a young <unk>, but only come to <unk>. I realized what's behind.
<unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> million people <unk> from the <unk> during the <unk> <unk>.
The father of this was <unk> to the <unk> <unk>.
What it's like, is that it's been <unk> at the time of the Chinese <unk>.
<unk> <unk> is <unk> with <unk> <unk> during the <unk> that he brought the <unk> in <unk>.
My mother was <unk> and his <unk> was being <unk>.
It was taken of <unk> in <unk> at the age of two <unk> years, under his <unk> because he couldn't live without him.
The <unk>, which has done the same, was <unk> in <unk>.
One day, he <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk>, and for this <unk>, was <unk> to the <unk> work for seven years.
The pain of <unk> can be <unk>, but the <unk> <unk> <unk> is from the present.
And then, all of that <unk> to a choice.
Do you live in the <unk> world, or we want to <unk> the world <unk>?
The great <unk> <unk> <unk>, before she died said that his greatest fear was that the greatest <unk> was that, in our going to go to this <unk> vision of the world, not only <unk> the entire <unk> of the human imagination <unk> to a <unk> <unk> of thinking, but a day we <unk> from a <unk> <unk> that there were to be a <unk> <unk> <unk> that there were other possibilities.
And it's <unk> that our species is <unk> for <unk> years.
The <unk> <unk>, which has given us to agriculture, which has done us in the <unk> <unk>, <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> with the <unk> of <unk>, creating the <unk> of <unk>, and we talk about <unk> years ago.
The <unk> world has to <unk> 300 years.
That <unk> story, I don't know we have the answers to all the challenges that we can <unk> in the <unk>.
When these <unk> of <unk> of the world's <unk> what we want to say to be human, <unk> with <unk> different <unk>.
And it's in these answers that we all <unk> the possibility of being what we are, a <unk> species, which has to make all the <unk> and all the <unk> can <unk>. And there's great moments of <unk>.
I <unk> this picture on the <unk> <unk> <unk>, when I went to <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk>, and this man, <unk> me the wonderful story of his <unk>.
The <unk> government has not always <unk> with the <unk> <unk> and in the '<unk> to <unk> our <unk>, we <unk> them in <unk>.
The <unk> of this man is <unk>.
The family, <unk> for his life, <unk> <unk> all the <unk>, and all his <unk>.
You want to know that <unk> doesn't <unk> the cold, you know.
The <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> fish.
The <unk> of this man didn't <unk> from night or <unk> from the <unk> that <unk>.
It's <unk> away, it <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> in your hand. When I did it <unk>, they <unk> it by a <unk>.
It's <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk> <unk> and when <unk> <unk>, he <unk> a dog.
He <unk> the dog and created a <unk>, with the <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk>, has <unk> another dog, and it's <unk> on the <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
Do you want to talk about <unk>? [<unk>] And this, in different ways, [<unk>] is the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and all the <unk> <unk> of the world.
<unk> <unk> the <unk> government <unk> to the <unk> of a larger <unk> of California and larger <unk> of California and <unk> <unk>.
It's their new <unk>. It's called <unk>.
It's a <unk> <unk>. <unk> all the resources <unk>.
One <unk> of how a <unk> can <unk> with his <unk>.
And, finally, I think it's pretty <unk> at least at least at the <unk> of the planet, <unk> that they don't have any <unk> at all.
For someone is home.
<unk> <unk> of the human imagination that <unk> to the <unk> of the time. And for all of us, the dreams of our children, as the dreams of our children, become part of the <unk> <unk> of hope.
And finally, we've been <unk> that <unk> <unk>, <unk> never to anything.
I think the <unk> --
[<unk>] They're not <unk>, but we think stories can change the world, and perhaps we're the best <unk> to tell the stories of the world. Every month our <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> million <unk>.
<unk> <unk> our <unk> <unk>.
Our <unk> are <unk> by millions of people.
Our work is <unk> in <unk> to bring our audience to our public in <unk> <unk> that <unk> away from which <unk> <unk> from which <unk> <unk> from which <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, the <unk> <unk> of <unk> in diversity, and we have to find a <unk> <unk> in a world and <unk>.
where the <unk> of all the <unk> can <unk> to our <unk> <unk>.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some of some things that I <unk> you've already heard and <unk> some <unk>, and <unk> to <unk> some <unk>, in case you don't <unk>.
I'd like to start with what I call "the <unk> <unk>."
What do you know?
The <unk> <unk> of all the <unk> society. The <unk> <unk> <unk>: "If we want to <unk> the <unk> of our citizens" The way to do that is <unk> the freedom <unk>. "
The reason is, on the one hand, in fact that the freedom is <unk>, <unk>, <unk> for humans.
<unk> else is in fact that if we are <unk>, every one of us can act to do everything that <unk> our <unk>, without any <unk> in our own own, without that <unk> in our own name.
The way to <unk> the freedom is to <unk> choice.
The more choices are, the more choices are <unk>, and more their freedom freedom, the greater than their <unk>.
This, <unk>, it's so <unk> <unk> in the society that nobody <unk> to <unk> in <unk>.
And it's also <unk> <unk> in our lives.
I'm going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible.
This is my <unk>. It's not particularly big.
I <unk> a simple <unk> on the <unk> to <unk>.
In my <unk>, there are <unk> <unk>, without <unk> the 10 <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> and the 12 <unk> that you can buy for you a huge number of <unk> in the <unk> that nobody <unk> already in the <unk> <unk> that nobody <unk> already is to your <unk>.
That's what <unk> is.
Then you go to the <unk> store for buy a <unk>: <unk>, <unk> <unk>, radio, <unk>, <unk>, radio, <unk>, <unk>.
And in this single <unk> store, there's a great number of <unk> <unk>.
We can make six and a half million different <unk> using the <unk> that there are just a store.
<unk> <unk> that there is <unk> choice.
<unk> fields: the world of <unk>.
Once, when I was a child, you could get all the <unk> services, <unk> that were <unk> by <unk> <unk>.
You <unk> the phone, you don't <unk> it.
And so, one of that, in the other, it was that the phone never <unk>.
These days, they went.
We now have a <unk> almost <unk> <unk>, especially between <unk> phones.
So here's <unk> phones.
My <unk> is in the middle, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, and <unk> for the <unk> <unk>.
If you don't have it yet, you're not seen it in the <unk> <unk>.
And what happens is that people <unk> in <unk> and does this question. And you know, what is the answer? The answer is, "No."
It's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn't do things.
So, in other <unk> of life that are much more important than <unk>, <unk> the same <unk> of choices.
<unk> <unk>: It's not going on in the United States that you <unk> from the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> you what you have to do.
Instead, <unk> from the <unk>, and the <unk> says, "OK, we might do." And then, we can do, "A," <unk>, "<unk>," <unk> has these <unk> and these <unk>. What do you want to do? "
You <unk> them, "<unk>, what do you want to do?"
And the <unk> says, "<unk> has these <unk> and these <unk>, and <unk> has these <unk> and these <unk>."
"What do you want to do?"
And you say, "<unk> if you were me, what would you say?"
And the <unk>: "But I'm not her."
The <unk> we call it "<unk>" <unk> "<unk>", "<unk>" <unk> "," <unk> ".
But it's actually not that one <unk> the weight and the responsibility and the weight and the responsibility to someone who knows something, <unk> the <unk>, to <unk> the <unk>, to <unk> the patient.
There's a huge <unk> of <unk> products, <unk> to people like me and you, that if you think about it doesn't make sense, because we can't <unk>.
But if we can't <unk>, because we <unk> them?
The answer is that they want we call the <unk> to <unk> the <unk>.
<unk> so fundamental as it is our <unk> now is a question of choice, as you see in this <unk>. "We don't want to <unk> kids. We don't want to <unk> the kids." We have to <unk>.
And we can <unk> how many times we <unk>.
The means that every <unk>, you have to decide that kind of person, you have to decide that kind of person.
<unk> to the family and <unk>, a time the common perspective, <unk> almost anyone, was that was that <unk> the <unk> as possible, and they <unk> to <unk> the <unk> as possible.
The only real choice was with the people, not when, and even what to do after.
<unk>, it's really to play.
<unk> to students very smart, and they <unk> their 20 percent less <unk> than a time.
And not because they're less <unk>, not because they're less <unk>.
but why they're <unk>, you know, "<unk> <unk>," <unk>, "<unk> <unk>," <unk>, "<unk>,"
"<unk> <unk> later? I have to think before kids or <unk> to career or <unk>?"
They're <unk> <unk>.
And they try to answer these questions, even though this <unk> doesn't <unk> the <unk> that they <unk> and not get a good <unk> to my <unk>.
And they really have to do that. They're important questions.
Now, the work: we're <unk>, as <unk> <unk>, because the technology <unk> us to work every minute, every day, from the <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, there's a <unk>, and I'm not going to say, "<unk>," <unk> "."
I don't tell you, because I want to use it.
What does it mean, this incredible freedom freedom of choice that we have about the work? Is we we need to decide, <unk> at any time, if we have to work or not.
We can go to see our son to play <unk>, with the <unk> in a <unk>, the <unk> in the other, and the <unk>, <unk>, on the <unk>.
And even though they're all <unk>, every minute that's a minute that we see our son, we're also <unk>, "I have to answer this call?"
"<unk> to the answer this? I have to <unk> this letter?"
And even when the answer is, "not," that makes your <unk> experience of your son very different from what would be in other conditions.
So, from all of the we look at things, little big, things, <unk> materials and <unk> life, life is a question of choices.
Once the world was this: <unk>, there were some possibilities, but it wasn't a question of choice.
The world today is <unk> to this: The <unk> is, "Is it a <unk> thing, or <unk>?"
The answer is <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> we know, we all know, so I'm going to talk about the <unk>.
<unk> this choice is two effects <unk> of people.
The first, <unk>, is that it <unk> instead of <unk>.
With many <unk> between which you choose, becomes very hard to do it.
I'll give you a <unk> example: a <unk> study on the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
A <unk> of my <unk> has had access to the <unk> data, <unk> <unk> society, with about a million <unk> <unk> in <unk>.
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are <unk>, the <unk> of <unk> <unk> of two percent.
With 50 <unk> <unk>, there's 10 percent less than when they're only only available to the time, they're just available. Why?
Because with 50 <unk> of which you choose, is to <unk> difficult, and choice is <unk> to <unk>.
And <unk>, and still <unk> <unk>, <unk>, and <unk>, of course, <unk> <unk> never comes to.
<unk> that doesn't mean just that these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> for <unk> because they don't have enough money, it wants to say that the decision is so <unk> that it also <unk> the decision is so <unk> that it also <unk> the decision for <unk>.
They don't know, they're <unk> up to five <unk> <unk> for the year from <unk> <unk>, which would be <unk> to <unk>.
So the <unk> is a <unk> of having <unk> choices.
And I think we're going to be the world like this.
"And finally, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> or <unk>?"
You should just make the right decision, if it's for the <unk>, right?
You don't want to choose the wrong <unk>, and <unk> the wrong <unk>.
So this is the first effect. The second is that even though we can <unk> the <unk> and make a choice, at the end of the result of how we <unk> states with less <unk> between which you choose.
And that's why we do it for several reasons.
One of these is that with many <unk> of which you choose, if you <unk> one and not perfect, it's easy to imagine that it could make a different choice that would be better. And what happens is that the <unk> <unk> <unk> us to <unk> the <unk> of choice, and the <unk> <unk> <unk> by the decision,
even when it was a decision.
<unk> choices, you have more easier for any <unk> that is <unk> of the <unk> of choice.
<unk>, there's what <unk> call.
Dan <unk> has <unk> very <unk> like the value that we give things from what we give things from what we call.
<unk> rest, when there are many possible <unk>, it's easy to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and being less <unk> than the <unk> <unk>.
So here's a example. I'm <unk> with all the people who are not in New York.
But that's what we probably <unk>.
There's this <unk> to the <unk>.
A <unk> place.
<unk> <unk>. <unk> day. It's all for them.
<unk> nothing. But what he thinks is, "Well, <unk>, <unk>, it's <unk>."
"All my <unk> <unk> are away."
"<unk> <unk> just in front of the house."
And it goes two weeks, I'm going to go through the idea that's <unk> -- every day -- the possibility of <unk> where it wants.
The <unk> <unk> for what we have, even when the choice was <unk>.
And the more the <unk> that we have from <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk>,
Here's another example.
This <unk> tells us a lot of things.
It's about the time, and perhaps to live the time.
But the most important point is that anything you want, you know, you're not going to do other.
The things that don't know many <unk> that can make less <unk> what we do.
<unk> <unk>: <unk> <unk>.
I tried to my skin <unk> a new couple of <unk>.
<unk> <unk> always <unk>.
Once the <unk> were just a guy, <unk> them and <unk> by <unk>, they were <unk>, only after <unk> <unk> a life and <unk> a lot of times, they started going.
So, I went to <unk> a couple of new when the <unk> were gone, and I said, "I need a couple of <unk>, this is my <unk>."
The <unk> said, "<unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>?"
Do you want them to <unk> or <unk>?
"
"<unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk>? <unk> <unk> <unk> --" <unk> to <unk> it.
I was <unk>, and after a little bit I was able to say, "I want the guy that was the only guy that he was, like," I want the only guy that was, so for a time. I <unk> all <unk> <unk>, and then <unk> from the store, <unk>, <unk> with the best of <unk> that I had ever.
It was the <unk>. With all that choice I had <unk> the best.
But it <unk> me worse.
Why? I wrote a whole book for <unk>.
The reason I was worse is that with all that choice my <unk> were <unk>, the <unk> <unk> to be <unk>.
I had <unk> <unk>. I didn't know anything about <unk> when I only had a guy, but when I only had 100 different, <unk>, at least one guy had to be perfect.
What I had <unk> was good, but not perfect.
After I <unk> that I <unk> with what I was <unk> in <unk> to the <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> in life of people do not make the <unk> that these <unk> have <unk> <unk> than the <unk> <unk>.
And this <unk> <unk>, even when the results are good.
<unk> in the world of <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Because if I <unk> it, I don't know what I'm talking about.
The truth is more to do this.
"It was better when you were worse," The reason why he was <unk> when he was worse, when he was worse, he was <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk>, in the world we live -- <unk>, <unk> citizens with the <unk> of the <unk> -- the <unk> that we can <unk> is that things are <unk> to the <unk>.
You never have <unk> <unk> because your <unk>, my <unk>, my <unk>, <unk>.
The <unk> of happiness -- what you're here -- is, "<unk> <unk>" Yes, you want.
I mean -- little <unk> moment -- that I'm really <unk> and my wife is really <unk>.
I couldn't do better, I didn't <unk>.
But <unk> doesn't always do a <unk> thing.
<unk>, a <unk> of <unk> <unk> when there's just that kind of <unk>, when there's just that you're not <unk>, and you say, "Why?"
"Who is <unk>?" The answer is <unk>.
The world is the <unk>. What could I do?
When you have hundreds of <unk> of <unk>, and you <unk> a <unk>, and you'll <unk> who is the <unk>, it's clear that the <unk> are you.
I could do better.
There are no <unk> available, there are no <unk> for the <unk>.
So when people make decisions, even though the result is <unk>, they <unk> <unk> and give them the <unk> to them themselves.
In the last years, the <unk> is <unk> in the <unk> world.
I think a <unk> <unk> -- not the only, but important -- of this <unk> <unk> is that people have <unk> experience because the standard are too <unk>.
And when they have to <unk> this situation think that the <unk> is them.
So the final result is that we're better, <unk>, but we're <unk> worse.
Let me tell you.
This is the <unk> <unk>, what we all take for good and it's completely <unk>. It's not true.
There's no <unk> that a little choice is better than <unk>, but by this is not <unk> that much better than you don't have much better than <unk>.
There's a <unk> value, <unk>. I don't know what.
But I'm quite sure we've <unk> from a piece of the way the choices to <unk> our life.
Now, from the <unk> <unk> -- I almost finished -- from a <unk> <unk>'s <unk>.
What it allows all this choice in <unk> society is the <unk> material.
There are many places in the world, and you know, <unk> <unk>, where the problem is not that they have <unk>.
The problem is that they too too <unk>.
So the <unk> that I'm talking about is a <unk> <unk> of <unk>, <unk> society.
And what <unk> does and <unk> is this: <unk> <unk> <unk> talked to you yesterday about how much these <unk> and <unk> <unk> to be <unk>. It's a <unk> of money.
I mean, these choices, <unk> and <unk>, is not that they're just <unk>.
They're <unk> <unk>.
They make it worse.
If a little bit of what we're in our society <unk> choice was <unk> in those people have too few possibilities, it wouldn't be <unk> to be better, but our.
This is what <unk> call.
A <unk> of the income does well -- not just the poor -- because of this choice in <unk> that we <unk>.
And so I'll <unk>, you can become everything you want --
<unk>, people of culture, <unk>: What do that fish?
"It's <unk> that you can't make anything in a glass <unk>."
"A <unk> imagination, a <unk> vision of the world --"
and I <unk> it so, I <unk> it, at the beginning.
But then, <unk>, I realized that the <unk> knows that the <unk> knows the long.
Because the reality of the fact is that if you <unk> the <unk>, you can't <unk> the freedom. You <unk> the <unk>.
If you <unk> the <unk> so that everything you can <unk> the <unk>.
<unk> the <unk>, and <unk> <unk>.
They need a <unk>.
This is almost <unk> too <unk>, maybe even for the fish, and certainly for us.
But the <unk> of some <unk> <unk> is a <unk> for <unk> and <unk>, for <unk>.
Thank you.
