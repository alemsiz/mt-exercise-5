The year I showed these slides to show that the calculate glacial calculus, which for almost three million years had the size of 48 States of 48 States of 48 States of 40 percent.
Acleash this under gravity because it doesn't show the gravity because it doesn't show the same.
The calculate glacial climb, in a certain sense, the climath climath climath climath climath climath climath climath climath climath climate the climbs.
You expands of inver, and they return out of the expand.
The next next to the next 25 years.
The gaacus enough are drawed in recent it.
As you see the blue blue skin the blue skin the blue sket.
This is the ice ice in the winver, which is that is the wind,
You can see that the ice ice ice ice ice ice ice ice ice five years or five years or four, is like the sket, which is like the sket, which is out of the body.
In 25 years is spent from this, at the time.
This is a problem because the interested in the Earth, the Earth, where there are enormous where there are enormous amounenormous amount of carbon -- they will come to the broads of the microws of the microws --
Rished to the totality of the atmospheric atmosphere, that quantity could radiation that quantity could rather be this point of not reritor.
In some laghi in Alaska little bit of the he's already rebook's already rebooka little bit of the water.

Video: Wow! Al Gore: Some is if you ask it will be now.
A motivating motivating grower is that the growth of the Greenland from the north.
This is a glacial regime glacial regime

This is a game of the instenough.
If you look at the context if you can see the consequences.
In the last five years we add 70 million tons of CO2 hours -- 25 million tons in the oceans in the oceans every day.
Look at the area of the Pacific Pacific American extremely west, and on the west, where there is a very poveriment of the continent of the oceans.
The most of the global warming of global global deforestation, which is 20, is the 20, is the usual usual combinable to be combinable to be combinable to be combins.
The oil, is a problem, and the carbon is lost wind is lost se.
The United States are one of the two countries with the emissions, together,
And they proponed to build a lot of other charges in the carbon
But we're assisting to a change,
This is the annothing in the last years and some of the last years of the reverss.
Actually, there's a lot of political lotly in our country.
The carbon industries of the carbon and oil, 250 million dollars in the last year for the last year to promote charbons that is a oxymore.
This image me remine me --
I know Natal, in Tenness, where I live, there's been a losss of 3.8 billion charge of charbong.
Maybe you saw it his nonce.
This is the second largest flew of scores in America.
It's happened around Natal at Natal.
The nacacross the natalized of one of the carbon was this one.
Video: Frosty the carbon is a balloasic and happiness,
It's a sundant here in America, and it makes our economy.
Frosty carbon is always bigger clean.

So our priority is invest a great amount of money in a clum, and confuses the truth, and confuses the truth, and confuses the real perhaps on the carbon the carbon the carbon the carbon the carbon the carbon the
In fact, the carbon is not sport.
We think it's a good -- has a good fump.
So not precupated,
Let me do to do it.
Video: Aclean: Carbon -- you heard about it.
So we do a game in a frowing in a frow structure of the charbon the charbong.
Straordinary machines are a little rowing rote technology of the charge.
The carbon is the main the main the main the main the well-global rescale of the charbong, you can see change.
Do a chokay, this is the technology of the carbon technology.
Al Gore: Infinally, the windows to the economic issue and the economic issue and that the national security and the national security of national.

The film that the college of the movie that is our dependence from the combustic combins, like the oil, and the oil, and the important.
Now, there's a new new audition to usual usual usual usual usual usual solution to us.
Britain: 100-percent energy energy in the old holds.
A plan to put America in America to work on the work, to help us to stop the global scale of global global warming.
Finally, a solution that basts to solve our problems.
Repower America. Scopy of it.
Al Gore: This is the ultim.
Video: H: He's treatment to America.
One of the fast fast fast fast to the dependence from the combustic dependence on our planet.
All the future is here. Vento, sole, solid energy -- a new rectasy new energy.
All right.
M: Repower America. It's time to be realists.
Al Gore: A old old proverbio African fly African fly fast, you go to the sun.
If you want to go to the way to go to this."
We have to go to the fast fast.
Thank you very much.
The year at TED phececks a introduction on the LHC.
And they promise to get to to get to to get the machine.
So what the other thing about the other time that the other time that the other time you don't have the LHC is the biggest experiment that -- 27 churcharge of circummps of circummps of circummmps of circle.
His comfortable to receive the conditions that were less than a second of the universe -- until the beginning of the universe -- until a second.
All is what is simply environment.
This is the Gineva.
We pictures these mini-Big Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Big Bang Bang Big Big Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Big Bang Big Big Big Bang Big Big Big Big in the reliefs.
This is what I work on. This is called ATLAS -- is a 444th and has a diameter of 22 meters and a diameter diamet.
This is a picture of ATLAS in ATLAS in building so you can notice proportions.
Ten seember 10 skets have accesor the machine.
And this pictures was taken by ATLAS.
It was because of immenside the reality of control.
It's a picture of the first phosical particles that had done all the game of the LHC, and in the collision, and a part of the LHC, and hard particles in the English particles in the reef.
In other words, when we see that image 10 skets the 10 settember, we understand that the machines works, which is a great liftorigin.
I don't know if it was to do it exultate this one one to Google and vide that the beginning was this one.
That means that we had a cultural impact of cultural impact to what scientific impact.
About a week docts, it was a problem with the machine, it had to these files here -- these films here -- these files.
This is 13,000 printing 13,000 printing the machines of the powerful powers.
Now, the technical technicians and dirance, "It's not true. I'm not truth."
And they can do it because when I'm very freedom to become the cosident cosidings of the surface of the surface of the surfactors.
So, at less 271 grades, to a temperature of the space between the space of the star space between the room can bring that corrup.
And one of the most emila of the most emila magnets in the LHC, there was a fabrication.
So the files are surriwing to read that is 13,000 printing and 13,000 printened a resistance of electricics.
This was the resulted.
Now, this is still more impression, if you think that these magnets fishing fish fishing about 30 centimeters, and that are places about 30 centimeters.
They are damage about 50 magnets.
We had to take it, what we had done to the thing that we did it.
We have repristined and add addities.
Now they're going to go back to all their ground.
Entrum the end of the LHC is going to be new integrated integrated again.
We're going to get it to get it to get to the data or whom to get out of the data or whatever we have the wind to find that they are the matter to find that universe.
Now, of course, in a certain the way, these inities are reaccepty the dibact of science and the Eingingers. It's easy to confish in frontal confuture.
I think the fact that it's hard to go to the by-beyond the limits, I think this value value of things like LHC.
I would like to conclude with the words of the English of the English of the inuses of the inuseful inuseful inuses of his pup, his hopefully was Michael Farael Faraael Faraad, and "No much of the human minds that ideas that ideas that the human ideas that are not going to be completely in nature, which is not our triggest, which is that we are completely well-new money,
Thank you.
I want to start asking you to get to to the kids, I play to the kids, and they play with the battons.
While you realize them and realized them and recording them and move them and move them and move them to think and resolve problems and hands to think and handscape and relationships.
The space is proployal is propertive to the way that we understand the world around us.
So, by informish information in our interaction with physics, together to my consults, and my consults, and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanith, I started to ask Jeevan Kalanith, I started to ask a computers, and if we have the only charge of the mouse as a wallow-ended information with a sun, we could be a fall, with a fascinatformation with ent, and I would be a fall, with the information with a sout,
and we arrun our pleasewis?
The question was so interesting that we decided we decided we could explore the answers, building Siftable.
In a few words, a Sifty is a computer interactive computer interactive as a birth.
In a few words, a Sifty is a computer interactive computer interactive as a birth.
You can move with the hand, they can see the hand, "You feel the movie, and they have a screen and a screen.
But absolutely objects, like the physics, like the battones, you can move to be able to recording it.
The Siftable example of a new ecosystem of a new ecosystem of the digital information information.
And the matter that becomes more physics, consciousness, and the others, and the others, and the people that are becoming more physics, like motion, of the others, like the others, like the others, like motion, we can explorate new and function.
I'm going to start with some example.
This is configurated for video -- if you including video -- if you including video that video will be a recorrupty of the other part of the other part of the other back.
This interactive riterious are conscious consciouss.
If they are interesting them to what they intore.
If they come circities, they can agitate a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of it.
If they come circities, they can agitate a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of it.
They also have their movement and inclinked their movement.
We realized that one of the interesting thing about the interaction was the power of the interaction of the interaction of the interaction as if it was a book.
In this case, we have three Siftless of the covernice and I can use them to the color, and I can use them in the central color, where they missing them in the central of the color.
and I can use them to be the color, where they missing them in the centry, where they missing them in the centry,
If we can do it very much about it.
These are also beautiful chance of appretty him, like languages and games where people can try to try to try to prove things can try to try things and see the speed results.
Now I'm --
This is a Fibonacc sequence of Fibonacs that I do with a program of equations.
This is a game of words that is in the words that is in the Scarabeum and Boggle.
Frother of course, to every turn house a letter to every Siftable, Pratically, to every turns out a letter in every Siftable, and while he he certainly slues on a detection of a detection.
And then about 30 seconds of remilarger remissing a new set of slectly channoise to try to try to try to try to it.
Thank you.
Here's what the children came to the Middle Lab, I did in the Middle Lab, and I did a video.
They are a lot of them are a lot of it.
And one of the interesting things about this kind of application is that you don't have to give people a lot of instrutions.
You have to say "Well the words, and they will be exactly what to do.
Here's what other people are going to be it.
This is our young head, there is a young best way.
And it was just implants to be implant.
They just were just matter to him.
Now, this is an application of a interactive cards.
We wanted to build a tool of the English of language Lui is Felix.
It can inserve new personages in the scene, it would be slowed their associates.
It can inserve new personages in the scene, it would be slowed their associates.
And it's doing it out the sun.
Video: The suns is sungarms.
David Merrill: On he's taken a treator in the scene.
Video: The treator -- it's treator
Bel work! Si!
So school that Siftline and put it up neighbors can interact the characters --
Video: Bau!
and inventing their story.
Video: Cao!
DM: It's a story with enough enough to slip like they fly soul.
DM: It's a story with enough enough to slip like they fly soul.
Video: Vololef,
DM: The last example I showed you is a tool, realized to be recently, to field and exected music.
it's a tool, realized recently, to field music.
The Siftable here is the basic sams like basically and the bacteria.
Every one of these has four different variations, and you can choice, and you can choice.
You can inserve these sound on a sequence of the comport to your food connection.
And modified it simply to touch a "ssuono" and a "sequence."
This is the effects that you can control and the film, like reverse and the film.
And you attacks to a particular and then including it to add it.
And then there are the general effects like time and volumes that are the whole sequence.
Let's look at how it works.
Video: D: We'll start a base in two Siftly," we can put a basic in a series, the extensive in a series, we add other base.
Now a bunch line.
Video: D: On on the percents --
Video: D: And I'm going to put the filter true, so I can control the effect of the live.
Video: D: I know to fast the entire sequence that inclining the whole sequence of a late or on the other.
Video: D: And I'm going to add the movie true to the basically true to give more expression.
Video: D: I can recombine the sequence of the sequence to the flight.
So I don't have to planning the first -- but I can improvising it to make a longer or more crun.
And finally, I can get the entire sequence the whole sequence of the left sequence to the left Siftly.
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is build new man-machines more more more more more more like our brain works.
And today, I had time to show you one of the results of this results of this results that we try to bring out of the laby.
The concept that I want to get this new generation of objects to this new generation objects for interacting with the digital media will bring in our world that we want to do in our world in our world that we want.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the time to talk to all of you.
I'm a writic.
She's my profession, but it's more than this is the obviously.
It's also the love and the fashim.
And I don't expect that can change it.
But what this particular is successful happened in my life and in my life and in my life and in my life and I recover, that he bring me with this work.
The thing that I recently written this book, this biography called "Mangia, Ama," Ama," Amaybe whatever I have a very different ways, for some reason for some reason for some reason for some reason that world and become a big sensational.
And the result is that everybody else to the people are treating me like if they were condence.
It true -- -- condency -- condence.
They are now now all worried and say, "You don't have pursue to me more to do that?
You don't have to continue to continue to write all the life without the most power that can be able to create a book, which can you can important?"
that can important somebody can you do that?"
It's rashing, you know.
But it would go to the worse that I remember that I remember 20 years ago, when I started to say people -- I was a adolescent -- I wanted to be a write -- I wanted to be a write of the write -- I wanted to be a write of the people -- I would be a write of the people -- I was a write to say to the people -- I was a adolescent -- I was a write to say that I would have a writ
I meet it against the same basic reaction from the country.
And people said, "I don't have the time I can't have success?
You don't have the well-refires of the refires of the refires?
You don't have to do this mestive to do this mestive life without out that nothing that it would ever come and go out and myself on a heart of skets with the brows of love energy falle?"
So you know.
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is, "Si."
I have a well of all those things.
I always had a path patch.
And I also have purpose of other things that people could not inate.
As and other things often things like this.
But, how to write what I thought and I asked me and asked me to be a couple of the write is why is?
Is it it?
It's logical that anybody who who are expect to be expect to be a work that they feel for it.
But what is that particular in the impresesely creative to make it reality to realize the minal health of the incharg?
How my father, for example, he was a engineer and I don't remember one time in his 40 years of activity that was asked to be exactly clips if they were asked to be able to be able to be able to be able to be engineer?
It was never -- that block of the engineer John, like you wis?
It wasn't work?
Onestly, the engineers like group like group as group in the century of being treated, the reputation of being alcolized by the reputation of being reputation of being alcockets
We writers, we have enough this reputation, and not just writers but creativity of all general, we have this reputation of being enormously instable, we have this reputation,
And it's not rest that look at the tristand contact of the death of the magnition of the magnitude of the windition of the young well-well-well.
And that the people who are not suiciddenly they seem to be really, they did.
Norman Mailer, before I was the last view of the interview said, "Ogni book a little bit more extraordinary recording to the work of the work of the work of their life.
But we don't have the way when we heard about why we have these things so much long that we have these things that we have completely interiorized the notion that creative creativity and the sofference that the art, and the wind, the wind, and the wind, conducducted to the anscientist and it will always be a scientish to the ansciously the well.
And the question I want to all the thing is is to all the way that is that I want to do this ideas?
It goes on this thing -- because it looks like a centimeter of the distance of the distance of this supposed to do this supposed to do this supposion.
I think it's odiose.
And I think it's dangerous and I don't want to see the perpetuated in the next century.
I think it's better incorporate our great minds creative minds creative creative creative and viver.
And I sure that in my case -- in my house -- it would be very dangerous to began to the reach that I feel the circumstances that are in my careera.
Obbasis, it's a young young well -- I have about 40 years.
I still have about four decade of work in me.
And it's very likely to write what I would write that it will be trum by the world like the work that I used to do it in the last books.
I'm going to be slav, because we are all more or friends here -- it's probably the very big successful to my big successful is to my shoul.
Oh, Ges: Oh, it's just like this.
You know this is the gender of thinking about a person to start to start to begin to begin to the morning and I don't want to do it.
I would continue to do this work that work that we love to do this work that we love to do this work that we love to do this work that we love to do this work that we love to do this work that we love to do this work that we love to do this work that work that we love to do this work that work.
So, the question becomes to become to become to become to become to be?
And so I seed me to do a lot of reflects, which is to continue to do a psychological costruction of protet, okay?
I have to find a distance of sumpty that I'm write, and my natural write, and my natural reaction that I wrote that will be written E, while I was trying to get to the time, trying to look through the time, trying to find other society to look through the time, trying to find other society to see if they could have the other ideas as they could have the other ideas as as well.
how to help people creative people to do the inerents emottype of creativity.
And that research me to the ancient Grecial and anthics Roma.
Seguitems because it was in certain and then background.
In the ancient Grecia and the ancient Roma -- people don't believe that the creativity came up with the humans, OK?
It was thinking that creative is that creative is about the divine and that came out of a few distant distant distant distant and sources and consciously distant and consciously consciously and consciously consciously report.
The gregrew of the spirits of creativity about the creativity "demonis."
Socrate, wonderful that it was a demon that they were charged by the way that it was swisdom of the long.
The Romans were the same idea, but they call that species without a genie.
The thing is great because the Romans were not think that a genius, they were very smart.
They have to be this kind of a kind of kind of exciting in the wind that they believe in the walls of a folden art, a little like elf, a little like elf, and that came out of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the result of that work.
Exxpect -- this is the distance of that -- that is the distance of the psychological psychological that is protected by your work.
And everybody knew that was that that was working, right?
So the artists were prots, like for example of things, like for example, what?
If your work was exceptional work was not going to take all the market, all the market, all the market, they all have been helped by this incorporate genius.
If your work is not the fally, it was not crype your fald?
All of the genius, which was your genius.
And so people han concept the creativity in Ocdent for a very time.
And then the Rindetaking and all changed that and all changed this big idea, we put this great idea, we have the human human human beings and the misters, and not left space, and not left space, and not left space, and not left space, and not left from the divinity.
This was the raational principle of the raational humanesthy and people start thinking that creativity came to think that creative creativity from ishared it.
And for the first time in the history, you know, this argument like a garm, which artist is like a person with genius, which is a person with genie.
And I have to tell that, I think that was a big error.
I think that allow somebody to believe a simple person to believe that it is like a recipient and the source of all my mysteries and the source of all my mysteries and the herents is a responsibility to a movie to be a great phrases that human.
It's like to ask somebody who who are the sun.
Deform and distores all these ingestible and creates all these ingestible expectations on the performance.
And I think this pression to have the artists in the pasts in the pasts in the pasts in the past.
And, if this is true, and I think that the question becomes and now?
Can we do it different?
Magary to a more understanding more ancy than the human relationships and mystery creative coming again.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we can't cancelling 500 years of raational thinking about 18 minutes.
And there is probably people in the audience that they would be legittims on the notion of the notion of the notion that they follow the next fascinating the next fashion.
I probably don't know you know, I will not convinced everybody on this thing.
But the question I would want to take is -- why do you do it?
Why do not think about this way?
Because it's more sense of every thing that has ever heard for explaining the explaining exexpertant process of creative process of creative process.
A process that is that that you ever ever have to do something -- -- quite foundly, all of the -- and it's not comportraationally, you know, it's not comportraition
And in fact, it can seems completely paranormal seems to be completely paranormal flight.
I did this meeting recently with the extraordinary extraordinary poet, which has 90 years, but that was a poet, and he said that the whole life and he said that he was a little bit of the Virginia, and I would have the wind, and I would have the wind, and I would be the wind, and I would be from the countravel.
He said that it was like a fragorous fragorous tren.
And that was rotough to the left of the country.
And it goes to get the ground of the ground under the ground of the building.
It was going to have a money to do that point and it was say, "corrup, you know, they said, "corrup, they said, "corrup.
And it goes to the home and it was inseced by this poethen, and it would have to make another one piece of paper, and a walking and a wild well-fastonished and the fast, and he would give it the pay on the page.
At times you could have enough to be quickly, so corree and recorres and the recorres and the chrooes and the poesise role and the chrooes and the lost of the rotough and it would continued to the round and it would be a poet."
And there were those times -- this piece -- this piece of -- there was never the moments that was going to be almost perdend, OK?
So, he was running to home and he was trying to charged through the past, and the poess, and he was a walking in the past, and then he said that was like if you well, it was like a well-well.
And he was the poevidence of the co-hand and the reputs and the reveied and the payer.
And in these fairly would be presented on the perfect pay and intact intact and intact around the last word to the first word to the first word to the first first of the first word to the first one of the last word for the last word to the perfect the perfect the perfect of the perfect word in the last word of the perfect word to the perfect of the perfects, but the last word of the last word
So when I heard about -- is patch, it's exactly well-of-initiative process.
Not all my process -- I'm not a conditiative condition --
I'm a mule, and my way to work is to work is sket, and I spoke up and on the same hororary and go to and go to and spent us on the game.
But even wind in my headardage, I was scientist, I fly met against that --
And I imagine a lot of you the han fact that you do it.
You know, if the work and ideas and ideas I would have to be a certain certain the sources I could not have to know it.
And what this is happen?
And how we can relate to the head that we don't want to give us the head, which is that we do to remapiece of remaking it?
For the example of the example of the example of the Musicist Tom Waits, which I interviews in a day.
We were talking about this, and you know, Tom, and you know, Tom, the major the major the artist of the artist of the argument of control, trying to control these species of the charges of creatives to the initiative species of creatives to the major the rest of the life was the initive.
But then instead, and a day day and a day while he was driving on the authos Angeles, he changed everything for him.
It was going to go and fast and all of a sky tracky this little framment, which is that it in his head, elusive and wish and wish and wish and wish wish and wish wish -- but it doesn't know how to take it.
It doesn't have a piece of cards, it doesn't have a mathematic.
So I started to feel this kind of old old this kind of old old old in him, and he said, "I'm going to remarrate to this canzone of this canzone of this canzone of this canzone of this canzone of this canzone of this canzone of this canzone of the old once that this canzone of the old once that canzone is perhaps in the well.
I'm not enough enough to do it."
And instead of the banic stop --
I'm going to go to the whole process and he did something completely new process of it.
I'm just going to simply the sky and said, "Scush -- I'm not see?"
"You seems that can write a canzone dog?
If you really want to exist, you get to a moment when I can take a touch, I can take a touch.
Other ther important to the important, you have to important.
You have to disturbing Leonard Cohen."
And his process working on this process after that.
Not work, the work was still swall like that.
But the fish process, and fishing the fishing genius, the genius, the genius, the genius, which is that they would be a remaking and it was going to be a whole thing that I had to be a whole thing that he had to be a whole thing about what was a whole thing about what was interiorished and returned to be a whole thing of the entirely that they would be a whole thing about the whole thing that was that I would have to be a whole thing eleventually like the whole thing that problem
but well-craws -- wonderful bizargument a conversation between Tom and this thing that I was not Tom and that he was not Tom.
So what I feel that I think about changing a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a time.
This idea, he save me when I was writing "Mangia, Ama, and he goes on to the one of those cleaning of the disperation that we have been working on something and we don't have to think that it will be a disaster to think that that what the worst is going to be the worst of the worse screen.
Not only good write books written of the books.
And I started to think about this project to this project.
But then I remember Tom that I talk to the air and try to it.
So I went to my face in the hands and I would say that my bements to a angle of the room.
And he said, "You know, who's well, what do is, what this book is not going to be brilliant not going to be brilliant not going to be the whole cold, you know?
Because how I see what I'm going to put all all of that him, I don't have the one one of this.
So if you want to show you and do your party.
OK. But if you don't know what I mean, I don't know what I do do nothing.
I'm going to write the same because it's my work.
And I would want to do that that was recorded that I today, I presented to do my own own own talk, because the end is -- -- the end is -- the end of Africa, the North Africa, the people who were raundances for the dancy of the wells and musics and walking and the walong the bought and until to the walloced and until to the well.
And they were always magnific because the ballers were professional and they were fantastics.
But every tant, of course, something happen, and one of these artists becoming in fact,
And I know what I know about why is I know that the view all of the time, a certain point, a performance of it.
It was like the well as the walerind walerind and walked through a kind of carbon and it was doing nothing about different from the sun, like 1,000 night notice, but all of the sun, and it all ineava.
And I suddenly don't appears like a human.
But it turns out to the beautiful illuminated in the fuels of the divinity.
And when this happened to the time, the people know what he was called his namname.
They were sent to hands and they started to cant, "Aah, Allah, Doh, God God."
That's God, you know.
Curious notice -- when the Mororor, the Mororor, and they preserve this abitude with their own and pronunced in the century of "Ah," "Oh, Allah, Allah, Aoh, Allah, Aool, "Oole, who's is you can still in the fle-crashs.
In Spage, when a gar, when a craw, and the magic -- "Ah, oh, oh, well, well, well, well, well, well, a chorder of God's God's God's God's -- a chorcial score.
And it's great because we have needed because we needed it.
But, the problem of the ballery ballery and wrong wote and discovered that they are 11 of Marteds and the wrote of Does there is no longer Do't further there, there's no longer more.
It's just a mortal death, with the gland, and maybe it will never be more to the character.
And maybe nobody will be the name of Dod even as well, what do is going to do with his life.
It's hard to be very hard to be very hard to be very hard to be very hard to be very hard to be very hard to be hard to hard
This is one of the most recyliations to do in a creative life.
But maybe not to be so angood, that they could not believe that they can not believe that the most expects of your being coming out of your being being coming from you to you,
But I just believe that you have to come from a instinct instead of this squisite of your life that you have to go to a little bit when you go to somebody else when you fine.
And you know, if we think about this is all change.
And so I started to think about it, and it's surely like I thought about different months in the work of the book, and it was a lot of the books that public books that I would take the dangerous charge of my big big successful.
And what I keep to tell me when I feel electric feelectric -- I weren't put.
I don't have to be argument.
It is to present, you know, to get you to your parts, any of them can be it.
If your work is ball, you know, ball.
If the divine, you know, I would have to leave a few kinds of the wonderful time to get some kind of wonder, for a moment of your shapes, now "Ole!"
Other triment, you do the same ture.
And "Ole!" to you, you know, you know.
I think I think and I think I have to teach it.
"Ole!" to you, just to get the human beings and headverion, and head, and the human textremely keep it continuing to keep it continue to keep continuously continuously to get it to the continue of it.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
As you know about some of these projects on the genome of these projects on the human genome of the new set of genes.
Now we're starting a new lost of the biology and we started to digitalize biology and now to that we are entering in a new fashion, and we go to a new fashigh-cluming new fashion.
We always tried to take big questions.
"What's life, is something that many biological biology I think about understand various llevels?
We tried different approach to the inition of the terms.
We're digitalizing almost 20 years ago.
When we sequenced the genome of the human world is treating the world of the biology of biology in the world digital computer.
Now we asked us to regenerate the life, or create new life from this universe to this universe to this universe a digital?
This is the maps of a little organism, the Mycoplasma genitalium, which is the small species between those that can authoreplicated in the lab of those that can authoref.
And we tried to reduce the genome of genome to create a little bit more smaller.
We're able to eliminating a centinspiring centines of the about 500 that are here.
But when we look at his maps to his maps maps to his maps to the now.
Credetember, this is simple
But when we look at all the genes that we can elimine, one to the time, it's very improbably that this can bring to a live.
So we decided that the only person to progress to progress in this cromosome, we could modific to make some of these questions for some of these questions.
And so we started the wind of "We can use a cromoso-like cromoso-may?"
It can make a chemistry these big molecules that we have never been able to create before?
And, in case of them?
A mosome, it's just a chromosome, it's just a chemical piece of chemical material chemical material.
The speed that we are able to degitalize the life is growing is growing exponential exponential exponential that we are able to exponential exponential exponential that we can degitalize the exponential exponential life is growing out of the exponential growing is growing to exponential
Our capacity to write the genetic code of genetic genetic code of it, but it's better than it.
And our most recents results of the exponential curvent care of the exponential curve.
We started 15 years ago.
The process has requires reckets with a biothic reviews before the first experiments.
But we found that sintetic sunching DNA is very difficult.
There are decine of the world that machines of the world that they produce in the world that DNA, the long ethrow of 30 to 50 lect leck and is a degenerative process is a long time of the charge, more remarkable to us --
So we had to develop a new metom to assembling these frams and correct the herrors.
And this was our first tent, in the information of the genome of the genome of Phi Can 174.
It's a little viruses that kills him.
We designed the frames, effect of the errors and kept a molecular of DNA of DNA land.
The interesting part is when we pretty this piece of material chemical material and we insert it in the bacterial batters have began to read this genetic genetic genetic particles and provisions.
The virals are virals and they have been released by cellules, are back and they have difact the Ecouple and they diface Ecocouple of the Ecouple of the cells.
I talked about recent industry with the oils oils that they have certainly understanding this model.
They have a more than you.
We think this is a situation that is a situation that software can really build his hardware in a biological system.
But we wanted to do things more in big things in big things.
We wanted to build the entire cromosome.
They're more than 580 milar code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code.
So we thought about built it in the cassets of the virus, so that we could change the cassets to understand who's components of a cell phone cell of a vivent.
The designation is crucial information is crucial information in a computers, these have to be very accurate to be very accurate to be very accurate to be very accurate information in a computers.
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 accuratethen, the accuratethory for every 10 10 10 mibasic milar error.
We found out of the gamazing game, 30 errors. If we were going to be able to do it very much that we never have been able to do it work.
A part of the process is to designer set to the 50 lect lectly that you feel that they have to build to 50 leck to build underneath to build unity to build under-winning and work together.
We can element element here.
You probably read that we inservices we have the phyliver.
And think that we have a genetic code genetic code on four liter: A, C, and T.
Tree of those lectum together with about 20 mino-mino-half, and there's a specifically reminid of the leck for every minate;
So we can use genetic code for write to write words, frather ther thought,
What we did at the beginning is the beginning is autiful.
Some are the fact that was not the fact that was not poewers.
We designed these segments for the powerful characters with the entire hang.
There are improving that they are reparents and put them together.
And we started to assembling the particular seven to seven to seven the literle, untendends to seven a lot of 24 milecture of 24 milectly in their literally time to get 72 milar to 72 miles.
At every step we product these segments in the fact that we have to sequency that we're tenting to create a procept that we're tremely robustop -- as you see in a minute.
We're trying to automatizing the process.
So, this looks like the table, this looks like a basic table.
When we go to these very long long long long long as a long long time to grow it in Ecoverything in Ecoverycole.
You get the limiting tools of the tools of the molecular biology
So we consider other monthectural mes.
We know another melse of another meckery called recombination called recombination of the DNA provide the DNA gram to the universe segments.
Here's a example.
This organism, called Deinococcus radiocockets can make three million radiation.
You can see in the requarer as his cromosometimes came to destruct.
In 12 -- 24 hours is reassembled exactly like it was exactly like it was exactly like it was exactly like it was exactly like it was a primaking.
And there are thousands of organisms that I have to do it.
These organisms can be telling completely to be completely to totally
They can live under the subject you want to get it.
I'm absolutely summer in space and you get the space and you get to find new environments of water.
ASA has showed that this aven.
This is a picture of the molecular that we built these process, just just using these process, just just using the design approaching of the segments of the gape of the gape of the molecular recent design.
The lievisit them auomatically the auomatically
This is not been scared with a microscope electronic microscope of a microscope of rular microscope of the electronic microscope of the electronic microscope of the electronic microscope of the electronic microscope of the electronic microscop
It's a very great molecular that we can see the very great microscopy with a microscopy broscopy of it.
This is pictures that they cover a period,
This is the audience, we did a little time ago.
They're more than 58,000 letting genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code.
It's the great molecular of a structure that it ever created by the man.
It is a fish molecular of 300 million hundred million hundred years.
If we spent it with a 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 pages that would like 142 pages to transcept this genetic genetic genetic code this genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic code of the genetic code of the code of the genetic code of the genetic code of it.
Now, how do we do it work?
Of course, we travel a virus.
It's a little bit more complicated when you use batters.
It's just just a simple cells as a cell cells like our re: you can simply ex: you simply the nucleo and insert a other, which is practically the process of clon.
In the bacterium, the cromosometimes is instead of the cell phone is that we are able to do a trapis that we are able to do a cromosome of a cell phone and a cell of a cell cell phone and active to another and active active it to another and activate it to another cell phone of the other active cell phones of a cell
We can do a bromosomes in a micromosometimes a microbial species.
The two different are different as men are the topis.
We add some genes in a few genes in a way that they could decide to this cromobile to this cromobile phoma.
The one has then scientist with the emerging of the bird of the proteins.
And when we put in in the cell is the stuff, -- and you have to the cell of our soffftwice, the new cromosome, the new cromosomes is going to go to the cells.
And we were really really really we could not go to the type of it, but we tried to be a lot of the sly.
This is one of the most matter myself too.
We found that tancient species have add a second or a third cromosomes from a few thousands of new tracks in a second new tracks that species.
So whom that the evolution as a gene of the gene that is not understood that the biology.
And there are the improvements called "immings of rections is that they addicty DNA.
The cromosomes that was in the cell doesn't have a little bit of the uncell as a cell that it was not going to be a cell that it was in the cell that was in the cell that it was in the cell cell as a cell cell that was in the cell cell.
The cell phone mosomes that we've inserito----ha.
It's expressed and recognized the other cromosome, it has recognized the other cromost, and we walked with only cromobile phones.
it becomes blue blue of genes that we have inserits.
And in a short of time, all the characteristic characterists of a species, and it turns out of the new species, and it was a new software that we insert in the cell phone in cells.
All proteins are changed, the membranes are changing, and when we read the genetic code of the equivalent exactly what we have transferition.
Now, this may look at the genetic software but altering the software we going to change things in the humanier enough to be sustain.
Now, I explained that here is not parking geness, but I'm going to be a particular to three million years and a half of the explosion of the explosion of the explosion of Cambrian explosion of Cambriana where they trum to this process of the Cambrian explosion of this process on this process of the genessional species of years ago.
Why do you do that?
I think it's obvious obvious when we think about our needs.
We're going to spend six billion people in the next 40 years.
Just to give an example for example: I'm born in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for the nesesistic existing in 46; it will be quite going to be quite here.
We're going to find the food now, and the brows and clean, and cleans, medicinal and a half a half of people.
It will still do it for us, for us.
We use five billion carbon of carbon of carbon of barbs.
That means a cent million bars of bills at the day.
When we try to find biological process, or any kind of process to remain remains to be a challenging phyenormous challenge.
And the most of the CO2 emission of CO2 of these materials that finishes in the atmosphere.
At day, thank you to the scientific discovering scientific ffound, we've got a database with about 20 million genes, and I like to think that are components to design,
The electronic industry is only one dozen of the electronic components, and think about how many different things are coming out.
Our are the maply of the biological reality and our imagination.
Now we've technical techniques, thank you to these nice synthetic metoketic that we call genomic genomic genomic combinatoria.
We're able to build a big robots that can produce a million chromosomes in a day.
Think about this 20 million different genes of different genes or trying to try to make a little bit of a type or to make a little brows or drugs, we can change it, and create more biology and creating more biology and create biology that in the last 20 years of science.
And it's just a slection of the standard.
We can choose to choices to survive survivive or carbon chemistry or chemistry or carbs.
This is an istantanea few software programmed on that we're working for a gram of the computer.
Well, we don't know necessarily how they will be not.
We know exactly what their genetic code code of genetic code
Now we're concentrate on the reality of how around,
You have seen you see that you experiment from the grand is a windowled experiment of the windows.
We have a lot of second and third generation that will be surround enough to the zuckery zero-food reality like the tanol.
But the only way that the biology can have a great impact without major major major the food and limiting the availability would be transforming CO2 in materials that we're working for designing CO2 in materials that we can be working for the world that we could have this before we could have this before we could have the first charge of the generation in about 18 months.
The sunlight to combined with CO2 is a metodom -- but in our discovered in the world, we've found different metodi.
This is a organism that we have described in 1996.
You need in the ocean propurns of the ocean perature of the ebooks of the water.
It recent CO2 using a molecular molecular like the energy of energy.
We're trying to understand if we can inchance, which can be transported to be transported to be transported by the CO2 in the CO2 carbon this process.
So what short is that we could be able to increase what the basic questions that the basic is Not, nut, we have the model, we have the model.
Exattly. If you do it from TED, where you can do it from TED, where you can do it with this?
It would wind a major energy.
Inother we are working for using the same metohods to create vaccines
You have this year with the influence, we're always background of a year and a dollars in a dollars a dollars a year.
I think that that it can change building vaccinable to change vaccinable,
Here's what the future would start to look like change, the tree of evolution, the tree of evolution, and the evolution with the characters of the arguments -- and involved cells --
We're so much to be the best people.
Our discovered is to live enough to try to make it chanic.
First of all you to see the most rapidly possible work in the new technology that we bring to Microsoft in the Microsoft in the follower to a hysimiles. This is Seadragonon. This is Seadragon.
It's a environment that you can interact in the local level that remote with a huge amount of data visual data visual data visual enormous envisual envisual environment.
This is a lot of gabyte photos of photos with a kind of craws and continue to a fast fast, to answer images like we want to do this images like this.
And it's not important as big as a great information that we see how much big these data cracks of these data or imagines.
Most is communications -- the digital photographs -- but this for example is a provision of the Congres-old scan. And reent, and reent, and reent, and reent, 300 migapixel.
It doesn't do any difference because the only thing that the prestations of a system like this is the number of a sympy in any time. It's also a very fleximproving architecture of it.
This is a book inter, example of data doesn't images.
This is the Casa desolated of Dickens. Ogni colons a hopen of Dickens.
So I'm going to show you that it's about the head, and we can do something like this, to see what generally, is about a representation of the head, not a representation of the head, not a photos.
It may be a little bit of a book, a little book, electronic books.
You don't have the well of it.
This is a more realistic example of a number of the Guardian.
Every pictures is the beginning of a century of a center.
And it will really give you the beautiful experience of the read version of a read version of a view or a view of a very crows of a very crowing a very crows of a very strong a very crowing a lot of half.
We also did something with the angle of this number of this number of the Guardian.
We created a public autiful advertising of that -- much more than that we use in a normal public in a normal public content.
If you want to see the characteristics of this auomobile, you can see here.
Or other models, or perhaps or perhaps technical technical models,
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminating the limits of space,
We hope that this means to put the pops and other port cheries and other pops are the most retree of the charge.
Of course, the maps is one of the most obvious applications of technology.
And on this is not to say that we don't want to say that we have contributes to the well.
This is all the way in the U.S. sobs of the NASA oblial image of NASA.
So now we go to something else.
This is actually actually from the webs; you can go to the webs;
It's a project called Photosynth, which combine two different technologies.
One is Seadragon and the other is a very interesting of the Microsoft to Nah Snavely, one student, one of the University of the Univer, with the See See Selish Selish of the Microsoft Rick Seliski Microsoft Ric, Seadragished in the University of the Microsoft and Seadrags of the Microsoft Rem Selish Seadrags of the Microsoft Seeliski Mick Sead. . . . . . . . . . . .
And it's from the web, I went to Seadragon.
You can see that when we do this kind of screen that kind of screen in the other and have this kind of experience and have this kind of experience to the last pla.
But the space of space the space of the images here is actually a meaning.
The recorded of the computer have recorded to the computer have recorded these images together, so that the recorresponds to the reality, and all the neighborhi Grashi Grashi Grashi Grashi Greashi Greashi -- are of a slide-shapes of a slide-shape of the things that are all space, and these things are all the spaces.
I don't know if I showed you some exciting environment.
And there are some very much more spacal spaces.
I want to spend directly to one of the nice set of Noah-- and this is prototynth--- and this is a prototynth-scores that we did for the first time -- to show you what we would show you what it is really the clearly the clearly the way that we have to be the very clear technology, and it's not necessarily to see the environments that we have a very walthy in the web.
We had to prepared about the legal expects and saw it.
This is a rebuilding in Notos of Notos of Notos -- and you can get to the Notos in Flickr. and you get images of types of totypes of the field of the fields, and you can get to this conversation of these conversitors -- and you can get this model.
So I'm all pictures to Flickr and have been all college in this way.
And it's possible to navigate in this way simple way.
You know, I would never think I was going to finish Microsoft.
It's very gratifiction to receiving this kind of accool here.
I think you can see that it is a lot of different types of photos of photos in those cell phones in those cell phones in this environment, a number meaningly meant in this environment.
And if you can reexcept those strange strange and you can see those strange.
Many of these are blocks, except --
And some part here is a series of photographs --
This is a Notos of Notos of the recorrectable.
We can spent from the sky places of this environment.
The essential point is that we can do with social things with social environmental -- from the ential internal memory of views like the Earth, from the visual point -- and college all those data together.
All those pictures are going to be college of the samp of the same.
You have a model of the Earth, which emerge.
Think about this as a long work of Stephen Lawler on Earth Terra virtual Terra virtual Terra virtual
It's something that grows in complexity that people are using the people who uses useful for who uses useful people who use it with us.
Their pictures are marched by other people.
If somebody is the idea of consciousness is the name of the name of Notos of Notos of Notos of Notos of all those dates data, and I can use of all those dates, and I can use to experience what you can use to experience that in the space in that universe, in that universe, and have a remoon on in that universe, and I have a cross-smodes from the cross-ctype of the type of the sks.
Of course, a conscience of all that are the virtual virtual virtual virtual of all interesting in the ter, you don't only only only money by viewells and images and images and similar, and similar, and similar, and the memory of the collective.
Thank you very much.
CA: I realized that what? What your software that your software to do is that a certain the next years, all the photographs of the photographs that everybody in the world will be practiced in the world will be practiced with who's going to be practiced with this?
BA: Yeah. What's doing in practice is doing it is to find
It's creating the hyperlink, if you want to be hyper-images.
And it's doing it in base of the images.
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the recheat the seeds of these images that a lot of these images that are going to edones.
As when you do a research of pictures on the web, and the head and the head of the web is about pictures of the photos.
Now, what happens if that pictures to all the voice of your photo?
So the amount of interconnection of the seeds and the fourth of reckets that is really enormous amount of retashion.
CA: Blaise, it's really incredible.
BA: BA: I thank you.
One of the beginning of the palance of the research of research is the power of the research is the power of the traditions, who has not dementions, those who are the past of the wind, the touches of the plants of the plant.
Bast, the way we have the samans Jaguar is still the Lattea, or that the Mananguy is still still colmyths are still colmyself, or that in Himalay, or whether the respiring of the respiring of the phogic Dharma, and that the importance of the ance, and that we live in the world in that we live in the world we live in the world in the world that we live in the world of course, but it's just a model of a model of the model of the reality,
the consequence of a particular choices that our argument that our irstirps -- well or a lot of generations.
And of course, we all share of the essential tracts.
All of it. Everybody procreive it.
We're subjects.
We have to deal the inexorsability of death, so we don't surprised and balliamoes --
We have a art.
What we have the reality of the canzon the thish of canzon, the rite of every culture.
It doesn't matter that they are the forest of the Borneo, or the Haity, or the Haity, or the Haity, or the Kaim in Kenya settled Kait in Kenya setters, or a wellise of And, or a camel, or a camelish.
He was my compagents in the desert of the journey in the desert of the world, or a hyak in the Everest, the demother of the Everest, the demother of the world.
All these populations of the people who are other ways of existing other ways of thinking, other ways of thinking about the world.
And if you can get a flight.
And we will be the brows of cultures of the world create a ragnatela of life spiritual life that was important for the planet, and it's important for the planet, as the ragnatela like the planet, as the ragnatela like non-ragnatela as biopen to the planet,
And you can think about this ragnatela cultural cultural flothnic and it can definity, and it can be the total total conceptic concept of all the conceptures in being in being in the well-in-inspirations, involved by the human floor.
The floor, the fantastic patrimoney.
It's the symbull of what we can be in how we can be in how inquisist specifics.
And sure as the biosphered was graving along the well as it happened to the flown and purch, and purch, and it was very much more rapidly.
No biology, for example, it would say 500 percent of all the species is the extinction of the extinction because it's the most apopular -- in the most apopular education -- in the most apopulation of the biological diversity -- and you would have closer to the most experience, which is the most of the cultural cultural ises -- that the different.
The indictable, obviously, the perdity language.
When you were borns in the planet.
A language is not just by a clums or a series of the class of rules a series of rules.
A language is the south of the human spirit of human.
It's the meeting of every culture is the basic world is in the material world
English is a forest of mind, a wind, a thinking, a system of the possibility of the possibility of the spiritual system of the inspiritual.
And those 6,000 language, while we are here in Monterey, alleast the half, it doesn't have to be sussurgered in the ears of children.
They don't have more teacher to the children, which means that it means that they are already morts.
What is more trister than the silence, the last silence, of being the last silence, not going to be the wish of the wish of the wish of the challenges or anicipate promise of the challenges of the challenges of the challenges of the challenges of the challenges of the well?
This is what I was doing is the one of somebody in some of the world every two weeks: every two weeks a walks and bring it in the tombs of a language in the tombs of a anguy in the tomb.
And I know what's going to say "It's not better like this?
The world would not a better place if we talk about the same language?" On, we talk about all all the same language. We are all around the same sleep, we talk about the same soul.
We talk about it.
Scover a tract thing that it wants to say not to talk about their language.
I would like to do a journey through the etnference,
a little journey in the sky of what we're lost is that we are perden.
Many of us dimentically when I say that when I say "different exister" existers" --
We can make this birth, Barasana, in Amazony settentrial population of the anacond, which credisease to the challenges of the flow-falls of the miled of the falls of the fall.
It's a popull popull that is not able to distinguior the blue cool because the chelestes is identify in the forest of the forest in the forest of the forest once the popull of the forest populse.
They have a strange language and a matrimonial regular well-examply language -- you can have a person that a park language that a different language.
All it has radicated in the past mythological past, is that the particularity is that in these family family are or sets or sets are or slow-practice languages no one of the write of the well-mysts of the mysts of the mysts in the past.
They listening to listening and then start talking about it.
We can take one of the most interesting tribes I lived with whom I lived to the Waoranans of Ecuador that has been primary before you have primed in 1958.
In 1957 five mission of the mission of a commercial contact of factor of fact,

The official official society of all the Western society is the reccent of the Western Western well-"The way to be the well-"The way to be the freedoms to be the freedom."
The reason why the liberty is in the fact that the liberty is in the same one value, is precious value, is precious,

So, from any part of any part of it, things and big things and big materials and the big, and the life is a question, and life is a question.
A world was this once the world was this -- there were some possibly possibly choice.
The world today, is the world is like this, the dilemma is "It's a positive, or negative, or negative?"
The answer is She's She's She's She's She's Shydrows.
The slides of the slide of that negative negativiews.
All this choices two effects of two negative effects on the gently.
The first matter -- it's producing paralysis that is produces that is that reliberation.
With options that the choices that choices to do it.
I offer a meeting example of the study constructed conducted on the planes of thinking about it.
A college of the Vanking of the Vankay, the gants of the Vanese source society of the foundly clients in 2,000 different companies.
What she found is that for every 10 10 solutions that are going to have to offert the percentage of adesion.
With 50 sources is 100 percent in less of the offers, and they are available to when they are available to only 5. Why?
Because with 50 sources that choice, is maledetail, and the choices is remaking up to the questions.
And the questions and still asking questions, and natural questions, and natural questions don't have to be making up.
Cape that doesn't only mean that these workers are going to be well-wells for cans because they don't have enough money, it means that the decision is so ostic that decision is so ostic sources of the work.
Not tewers, they're lost to 50,000 dollars a year from the dator of work, which would be well to be able to arilable to them.
So the paralysis is a consequence of the choice.
And I think that makes the world like this.
"And for finally, for the eternity: ketchoop or main?"
You would take the way to take the decision of the game, if it's for the eternity, right?
You don't want to choose the browing wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong.
So this is the first effect. The second is that if we can evitate the paralysis and do a choice, we are less to the end of the result of how we will be able to be a lot of opportportraising whom we would be able to choice.
And this for different reasons.
One of these is that with a lot of these is that with the choice, if you buy a and it's not perfect, it's easy to imagine that you would have a different choices that happens is that that happens is that that happens is that the alternative choice, and the reduce of choic, and the recool choic, and the received of the decision of the decision of the decision of the decision of the decision of the decision of the decision
even when it was a type of it.
More choices us -- it's easy to be able to dispiacer's uncle that is insoddence.
Inother not, there's what economists is called the coast-opportunity.
Dan Gilbert asked a very well well as the value that we are the value of what we confronts.
And the way you would have a lot of options that is easy the characternative characternative and be less of the option that is choices of the option that is choice.
Here's a example. I swing with all that that I'm not in New York.
But it's what probably probably think about it.
There's this copy of the Hamptons.
A place of slusse.
It's splendid. Otype of a day.
Not nothing about nothing. But what he thinks is, "Well, the malespe."
"All my neighbors in Manhattan are of it."
"I would talk about this is in front of home."
And the past two weeks from the idea that is perdrop -- every day -- every day -- every day -- the chance of parking where it wants to talk about where it want.
The opportunity of the diminishes the soddddisfation for that we have to choice.
And the most exactly the options that we have to consider the characteristics will be constantly as a constantly as a constantly coo-opportunity.
Here's another example of it.
This is a lot of things.
We talk about the moment, and maybe the moment, and maybe you live to live there.
But the most important point is that any thing is that you can choices you can get the others.
The things that we don't have a lot of four active that they can make less that we do it.
Terzo point: spiral growing expectative.
I tried on my skin my skin a couple of jeans.
And I also also almost always jeans.
A time the jeans were just a type of a type and westived them and westived them a lot of times, and they had a lot of times, they were starting to go well.
So, I went to buy a new time when the old old old old the old old of jeans, and he said, "I need a couple of jeans, this is my cuteans, this is my cute."
And he said, "Like me want to slim and said, "Like and phit?"
Would you want to the cernier with the bottonished bottonish." or "Stone."
"You want to the street?"
"Sotos or stretts? Ble is the black -- "Continution was a sunef.
I was swalder, and after a little bit of the guy -- "I want the guy -- that it was the only one guy -- it was the only one idea that I was going to try to all the same time I was going to all the well-well-well-well-well-well-well, and the best jeans that I had ever ever ever ever ever happen.
It was the bad. Con all that choices had a bunch of the ball.
But I heard of it.
Why? I wrote a book interact to understand it.
The reason that I was worst worst is that with all that choices were expectations were altised to be perfects.
I started to began expectations of expectations that I was nothing about exceptional -- but when you expect a type of 100 different guys had to be perfect.
What I had water was good -- but not perfectly not perfect.
After I was talking about what choiced with what I was trying to be insodddated in confront of it.
The addition of options in the life of the people who have to expectations that these are respectacs of the options.
And this will be less to soddddisftion, when the results are good on.
No one in the marketing world makes it content.
Because if you know what I'm talking about, you know, I know what I'm talking about.
The truth truth of this.
"You was working on the worst when he was worgives to the well when he was worst when it was worst when it was going to be able to involved in the surprised of the surprised surprised of surprised surprised that they were worgiven evolved to the surprised of the surprising of the
Ogo, in the world we can viviviews, industrialized citized citizens with the perfectly expectancy -- the treats of the expectative.
You don't have never surprised because you have to be expectative, my expectative, they are injatants.
The secret of happiness -- what you're here is -- "Well, if you expect."
I want to say -- small moment of the auobiographic moment -- that I'm really spoke and it's really stuff.
I would not have to do better, I don't have to be accounted.
But it doesn't always always have a brutter thing.
And finally, a conscience of the buy jeans of jeans when there's only that kind of jeans is that when you're not going to be able to say, "Why do you do you say, "Why do you know, "Why do you do "Why do you do "Why do you do you do "Why do you are are just that kind of jeans
"Who's responsible to it?" "Why is is clear.
The world is responsible to do we do that?
When you have hundreds of jeans, and you buy a insodddwell, and you ask you who is responsible to the responsible is responsible to be responsible to the responsible that responsible for you've got to you.
You would have to do better.
With hundreds of variety of the available, there are not going to be the insuccessful.
So when people are taking decisions, even if the result is walking, they sentently well and they give them and drops and they have the couple of their own own own own beings.
In the last years the last years the depression is exploin the world industrialized in the last years.

And when they explained this situation think the colp, it's the colp,
