Last year, I showed these slide slide to demonstrate that the calculation artica, which for almost three million years has had the size of 48 continents, you have had the size of 40-percent.
But this subvalue of the problem because it doesn't show the ice of the problem because it doesn't express the ice of the ice of the problem because it doesn't except of the ice of the problem because it doesn't except of the problem because it doesn't expressed.
The artickle is is in a sense, the clear heart of global climate system.
You expanding and reverse and you return into the summer of the summer and reverse of the summer and reverse of the summer and reverse of the summer and returns.
The next slide is going to be a quick fast of the last 25 years.
The perenninies are signed in red red red red in the red red red red
As you can see, they expanding up to the Europe blue blue blue --
That's the ice in the winter that is reducing extending extend.
You can see the cosident cosidence called five or sevenue, five years or more, is like the blood of the body.
In 25 years has been from that at this way.
This is a problem because the really really interested in the ground of the ground of the ocean around the ocean article where there are huge carbon amount of carbon constraints that are transformed in meter from the microbes.
It respect to the total pollution, global warming, that amount of global warming, that amount could double this point of not return.
In some deeper in Alaskey is already rebolling from the water.
The propertessorse Katey Walter of the University of Alaska team was recently flowing lago last last last inverside.
Video: Wow! Al Gore: He's good. The question is if we will be in us.
A reason is that this exchange change of the Groenland from the north of the north.
This is a glacial record of glacial record
The laughed never to reach levels of the spot.
This is the Kangerlussuaq, in the Southeast of the Groenlluse.
If you want to know how the sea level of sea sea ice of ice on the ground of the sea ice of the see.
These currents are increasing very quickly.
Another part of the planet: Antarctic, the greatest of ice of the planet.
The month of scientists have delighted that the ice of ice is in negative, and that the ice of the Western Western Western -- that poga, is particularly quickly in the money.
It was six feet of the water, like the water, like in Groenllland,
Sull'Himalaya, the most big block of ice -- you see new laghi, who were ice to see new laghi, who were glaciers.
40 percent of the world's population received half of the water water water from the monkey water.
Sullear Ande: This glacier is the bottom of this city.
The laughtered is increased.
But when you deminisces, the same thing is happening to the water water water water water pound.
In California neve on Sierra Nevada is deminiminuita of 40-percent.
Midries are in the crisis.
The previsions, as you have a several bs.
The growing security in the world leads to a nice of prefens.
The environmental disastery is increasing a rhythm and previous received by the normal and without previous previous packing disaster and without previous precedently previous disaster and without previous precedented.
Four times more numbers in the last 30 years of previous previous previous previous previous for the previous previous precedently in the last 30 years of the previous precedently in the last 30 years of previous previous precedented.
This is a whole game of all sustainable of all sustainable.
If you look at the history of history if they can see the consequences of it.
In the last five years we added 70 million tonons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tongues in the oceans every day.
Look at the Pacific, the area of the Pacific, from Americh, and both of the subject of the subcontinent -- where there's a radical impoor of the oxygen in the ocean oxygen in the oceans.
The greatest because of global warming, with the deforestation, which is 20 percent, is the use of fossil fuel use fossil fuels.
Oil's a problem, and the coal is even worse is worse --
The United States are one of the two countries with China.
And it was proposed to build a lot of other central central to build a lot of carbon.
But we're listening to a direction of direction.
These are the projects are the last few years and some evidence of green alternative verse alternative versus of green.
In the way, there's a political lotta in our country.
The coal coal and oil industry has 250 million dollars in the last year to promoting carbon clean, which is a oxymore.
That picture reminds me --
Natalalso, in the Tennessee, where I live -- there's been a 3.8 billion gallons of carbon dioxide gons.
Maybe you saw the news of the news
This is the second biggest flower of scale in America.
It is happening around Natal.
The natalization of one of the coal industry was this.
Video: Since coal is a kind of coal and happy.
It's abundant here in America, and it makes our economy.
Frosty the carbonaio is more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and
It's good for the price, adorable and the workers are they share the shift of it.
Al Gore: From here is a lot of coal West Virginia.
The biggest larger society about the mountains is Massey Coal. This is his friendly.
Video: Don Blankenship: Sarrrate -- Al Gore, Nancy Reid -- they don't know what they're talking about.
Al Gore: So the Alleance for the Clima Proteation of Clima has launched two campaigns.
This is a bunch of be, a partner.
Video: Attore: ALergy we see climate changes like a serious evil as a sery sertune to our business.
For this our priority is to invest a big amount of money in a very strong money, to make public and consummitary truth and truth truth and truth truth to make public and confused the fuel of the carbon.
In fact, carbon is not sport.
We think it's cleaned -- has a good profumy.
So not preocuph of climate change
Let me do it.
Video: Attore: Carbon pulightly -- you heard a lot of it.
So let's do a kind of a structure of the favanuary for how it is.
Straordinary! The machine are a little road of it, but that's the sound of the clean-up technology of the clean-up technology of it.
The carbon consums is between the main cause, global warming, but the nievable technology but the nights of the carbon diox.
To a eye -- this is the haternal technology of it.
Al Gore: Infinally, the positive alternative positive to economic the economic question, and the national security.
Video: Comment: America, it's in crisi; the national security crisis, the climate crisis.
The file that the lines all of the fossil fuel of fossil fuel and oil, as the fuel and oil.
Now, yet, there's a new solution for users use.
Read America: 100percent of clean energy in 10 years.
A plan to reput America to work, make us sure sure sure that we secure ourselves security.
Finally, a solution that is to solve our problems.
You're going to be America. Scover more.
Al Gore: This is the last one.
Video: Comment: It's about reeating energy to America.
One of the fastest ways of porate fast dependence from the fuel of fuel that kills our planet.
Comparsaying, the future is here. Vently, a new network.
It's about 2: Nuovi investment for jobs for jobs for a lot of work for a good job.
Comment: Read America. It's time to be realistic --
Al Gore: A great African old proverbio African says, "If you want to go speed from the sun.
If you want to go away from it, go together."
We have to go far fast, quickly.
Thank you very much.
Last year at TED I did a TED introduction on the LHC.
And I promises of returning to you about how the machine.
So here I do this her, and for those who other time not her, the LHC is the biggest scientific experiment -- 27 miles of circumst.
His compit to reach the conditions that were less than a billion of second from the beginning of the universe -- until 600 million times a second.
All this is just the environment.
This is the car below the Ginevent in the Ginevation.
We do these min-Big Bang of the Mg Bang in the detectors.
This is what I work. It's called AS -- it's about 44 meters and a 44 meter and has a diameter of 22 meters.
This is a spectacular picture of ATLAS in building so you can see the proportions.
We have the 10 secember last year we accessive the car for the first time.
And this picture was taken by ATLAS.
It was because of the immense of control.
It's a picture of the first particles that had done all the around of the LHC, entrank in collision, deliberately, with a part of the LHC, and spread particles inside the relevel inside the detecator.
In other words, when we saw that picture the 10 secember, we understood that the car works, that is a great live.
I don't know if it was doing this to do that when somebody went on Google and saw that when somebody went on on Google and saw that the beginning was this.
That means we have a cultural impact beyond in the scientific impact as well.
About a week later, there was a problem with the machine, had to these dors.
These files bring 13,000 amps when the car car works at the mouse of the power of the power of the power of the potential of the power of the power of the power of the mous.
Now, the technical of you will look at the movies and will say, "It's not true. It's not true. They're just too subtle subtily."
And they can do it because when they're very cosident cosid."
So, at least 271 degrees, at a wildlife between the stars, these films can bring that current of the space between the stars, these films can bring that current.
In one of the junctures in the LHC, there was a fabrication defected defection.
So the movies of warming a little bit of a thousand amper suddenly meant a electrical resist.
This was the result.
Now, this is still more impressive, if you think these magnetic weights, and that have been moving over 20 centimeter than 30 centimeters.
They have been damaged about 50 magnetic magnets.
We needed to take a little bit of what we did.
We have repristined and upset them and upset up and upset them up.
Now they're coming back to their subject all of their place underneath it.
I love the end of the mark LHC is will be new inteam.
And we accenciate it, and we expect to get the right data or him, and continue to find out what the morning, and we assuming it to find out what the morning, which is the universe.
Now, of course, in a way, these dynames reaccendate the debate on science and engineering the value of science and engineering.
I think that the fact that it's so difficult to go beyond the limits, I think this is the valuable of things like LHC.
I want to close with the words of a Inglese, Humphrey Davy, the guy, imagine, in defense of the pupill, imagine, his pupill, his pupill, his pupill, he said, "No is that as dangerous for the human mind of the human minds of the mine of the human science are definitely definitive, that there are not mysteries in nature, which our trionto be in nature, which is not not new money.
Thank you.
I want to start asking you to rethink about how children, you played the morning.
As you understand how to reach them and reach them and to make them go and move them, you learn how to think about solve problems, and make it solving problems and make a lot of spaces.
The space reasonable reasonable reasons is deeply connected to the world around us.
So, from the informath of our whole physical objects of our physical objects with my consults, and my Patti, and my collaborator Jevan Kalanithi, I started asking to ask is, "And if we use a computer -- instead of having the mouse of the mouse as a nice of the digest, that it dies to make a required redraming of information with both both of information with both both mans,
and to make it a pleasant to support our pleasure and to system?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer, building the answer, building the answer, building the Siftable.
In a few words, a Siftable computer is a great computer as a great discook.
In a few words, a Siftable computer is a great computer as a great discook.
You can move with the hand, they can be able to be to be able to be able to be able to be able and a wireless radio wireless and a wireless radio wireless.
But especially are objects like the morning, they can just move away from the morning, you can just move away from the time.
Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem for a new ecosystem for a digital information to man.
And as they become more physics, you know about the movement, they know about the movement, others, and as they become more physics, and as they become more physics, as we did, and as we can explore new and funny stilks of interaction.
I'm going to start with some simple examples.
This is a Siftable is configured to show vide: if you win a direction of the video direction, the video will roll like this, if you win the other side side back.
These interactive rings are connected to others.
If you stand they do care about what they are they intororord.
If they come and you can again a little bit.
If they come and you can again a little bit.
They also have their movement and including their movement and inclining.
We then realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was able to use the community of the interaction of the interaction of the interaction as if it was a liquid.
In this case, we have three Siftable configured as a green seats and I can use them to deal with the color in the central area, where they mix mission.
and I can use them to be used to be able to deal with the color of the central that they mix up to the color in the central that they mix them to be about.
If we are find too too much of it.
There are also good possibility of learning, like languages, the mathematics and mathematics and logic games where people can try and see the results of the immediately.
Now I'm --
This is a Redwood, a Redbonacks that I do with a equation-program program.
Here we have a words of words that is half of Scarabeo and Boggle.
Prratic every turning, I got a letter on every Siftable, Prrrically, at every turns, and as you get a letter to any switness on any slums, and as you try to make a dictionary.
Then, after about 30 seconds remisses and you have a new set of letters and new possibility to try it.
Thank you.
Here's what the children came to the Media Lab, I did that tried that I tried them and turned a video video video.
They have a lot of pleasure a lot of it.
And one of the interesting things of this kind of application is that you don't have to give people a lot of educational things that are not to give you a lot of educational things about this kind of interesting things about this kind of device.
You just say, "Compone," and they know what to do.
Here's how other people that try it.
This is our betterwards young testers there,
It really wanted to be employees.
They were only morning, for him.
Now, this is a application of a whole whole whole active carton.
We wanted to build a tool, to the learning of the Lui Hef is Felix.
It can be able to insert new characters in the scene, satissssling,
It can be able to insert new characters in the scene, satissssling,
And it's doing the sun.
Video: The sun is surging.
David Merrill: Now brought a treat the scene.
Video: The treator arancient treat.
Bel work! Yes!
So if you look at the Siftable and can interact the characters --
Video: Bau!
-- by inventing the history.
Video: How!
DM: It's a story with a story with the open final final opening, and it can decided.
DM: It's a story with a story with the open final final opening, and it can decided.
Video: Gulo, gap.
DM: The last example I have time to show you is a tool that I did a remarkable to be recently and executionary of music.
It's a very recently made recently, for sampling and executing music.
Siftable here are acting sound as lower, lower and bacteria --
Each one of these has four different variations, and you can choose what you use.
You can put these sound sounds in a sequence to make it compounds to your pleasure to your pleasure in a sequence to get to the sound with your pleasure.
And to make it just touch it a sounds and a "Redan."
These are actually actually that you can control from living as the rivers and filters.
You attacks to a particular one particular and then including them to upset up.
And then there are the general effects as time and flium, which is applying the inters of sequence.
Let's look at how it works.
Video: DM: We will try and put a basic in two Siftable "sequenc," we go into a series, the extend of the extend to the other low.
I put a lower line.
Video: DM: Now add d percent of ussions,
Video: DM: And I'm going to put the bacteria, so I can control the effect of the living living living from the living of the living living in the live.
Video: DM: I can fly the entire sequence of the time from a side or from the other.
Video: DM: And I'm going to add the bottom to give more expression.
Video: DM: I can recombining the sequence "fle."
So I don't have to plannish it before, but I can improvide it longer or more course.
And now, finally, I can smoke the whole sequence on the left of the Siftable "volume."
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is to build new interfaces man-seats of man-several man.
And today, I had time to show you one of the results, and also some possibilities that we try to bring out from the lab.
The concept I want to turn is that it's coming this new generation of objects that are designed to interact with digital media media media media in our world in the way we want.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the time to talk to all of you.
I'm a writer writer.
And you know, books is my profession is the more than that, of course, but it's more than that, of course, of course,
It's also love and the love, and the folder of my life.
And I don't expect to be changed.
But this is that something particularly happened recently in my life and in my life and career, who brought me to received me with this work.
And the particular thing is that I recently recently wrote this biography called "Mangia, Prega, and the quality, and I mean, I have the quality, for a few reasons that they did a great sailing, "Bestse" -- a great sailer, but but but in the interaction.
And the result is that wherever you go from now, people who treat me as if I convicted it.
It's true -- convicted -- convicted -- convicted -- convicted about.
They are all concerned to me and they say, "You don't afraid to do better.
You don't really have a fear of continuing to write the whole life without being able to create a book that could matter to somebody?"
that could matter anybody us?"
It's rassicurant, you know, you know,
But it could go worse and worse that I remember that over 20 years ago, when I started to say people -- I was a training adolescent -- I wanted to be a writing.
I would put in the same insure, based on the land.
And people said, "Do you don't have to be successful?
You don't fear that the humble of refute kill?
You don't fear to do this mestiate for all the life without any of them to die on a cumulation of saming saming with the mouth of the mouth of the failing bat of the failing of failure?"
So, you know, so you know,
The answer -- the short answer -- the short answer to all of these questions is "Yes."
I have fabulous fear of all those things.
I always had fear.
And I also have a lot of other things that people can't have to be in it.
As the hand other things that are spectacularly things that
But as it is about about the writing what I thought and ask me the laughter is becauscausing?
Is it rational?
It's logic that anyone should be waiting for being spent from a work that feeling for it.
But what is there is so particularly in the creative imprevent to make us about the healthy of the mental health in a way that other careful careful than other careful cars to not do that?
As my father, for example, he was a chemical engineer and not remember one time in his 40 years of activities that he was asked if he was asked if he was asked if he was afraid to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer if he was afraid to be engineer to what the dot of the activity of the activity that was asked if he if he was asked if he he was about being engine
It was never -- that block of engineering engineer how is it worth?
It wasn't going to work.
Only, chemicals like they don't have certainly uncertainly in the seats, reputation of being alcoiled by depressive.
We writers, we have enough this reputation and not only writers but creatives of all these reputation reputation of being enormous instable reputation that is enormous intual reputation of all of them --
And it's not really, to look at the tristage of the magnificent deaths of the magnificent of the magnificent of the magnificent guns and often them.
And even those who don't have look like they really have been disappeared to be really dissed by their women.
Norman Mailer, before I die, in the last interviewed said, "Of course, my book has killed me a little bit more than -- extraordinary of the provide of the own.
But we don't dnarrow when we hear it because we heard these things so we heard these things that somehow we have completely interiored and accepted the notion and suffering are somehow to be and somehow you and art, and the art, to the hold and that art, will always be in the front of the hangot, and the hononto the enjoy of it.
And the question I want to ask all of today is you agree with this idea?
So it's good to this thing -- because you look at this thing -- because you go to me not good for anything that supposition.
I think it's hate it.
And I think it's also dangerous and I don't want to see the perpetuated in the next century.
I think it's better to encourage our great creative minds.
And certainly I know that in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to start out to that I was dark about suppositions, especially the dramatically of the circumstances in my career.
It's really -- I mean, you look at it, I'm pretty young people, I have about 40 years.
I still have about four decade of work in me.
And it's very likely that anything I write about now is going to be judged from the world as the work that came after the work that came after the last book.
I'm going to slave, because we're all more than my own shoulder here -- is likely to my greatest story is to my spect at my spectacular.
Oh, Gesus -- which is thinking.
You know this is the kind of thinking that leads a person to start bing the belongs in the morning, and I don't want to do it.
I would keep doing this work that we do.
So, the question becomes it like, right?
And so I think about it, after a lot of reflection that the way to work and write is to create a psychological costructure, right?
I have to find a safe of security between me, that I'm writing -- and my natural analysis, and my natural analysis on what it reaction is going to be looking for all over the time, trying to find other societies to see if they could have the best ideas to see if they could have better ideas and more health ideas to see if they could have the best healthy ideas and more health and more health and more health ideas
how to help people create creative people to manage the inerents emotional rises of creativity.
And that research led me to the ancient Greek and ancient Room.
See why you go back to the circle and then back back back back.
In the ancient Greew and ancient Rome -- people didn't seem to believe that creativity came from men -- OK?
It was thought that creativity was this spirit and several sed, and that came to men from a few distant surprising and unknown away.
We call these dams of these spirits of creativity dians of creativity "demony."
Socry, wonderful, he believed to have a demon the headom of the heavily heavily.
Romans were the same idea, but they called that kind of spirit without a genius of spirit without a genius of the same kind of spirit without a genius of the same kind of spirit without a genius of the same kind of spirit without a genius.
That's great, because the Romans didn't think that a genius was really really a genius would be smart a genius is really smart a genius was really smart a genius was really really really smart to a genius was very smart genius would really think a genius was great.
They create a genius was this kind of divine entity that grew literally in the study of artist, a little bit like the elfe Dobby, and who came out to be hidden with the German Dobby, and who came up with that work.
Ectional -- -- -- -- -- -- this is the distance of what I talk about -- that cold psychological costructure, which protects you from your work.
And everyone knew that was that that was how it worked, right?
So the antic artists were protof certain things, like for example, as a narcissalt, right?
If your work was exceptional wasn't you could take all the degree of the degree of the incorporeo.
If your fail, it wasn't all of your work -- it was not all of your failure.
Everybody knew that was your genius to be a incapable to be a incapable to be a deal.
And so the people handed the creativity in the Ocker for a long time.
Then the Resears came and everything changed and changed this big idea, we put the human being in the middle of the universe of the universe of the universe of all the mysteries and no longer space to the detail creatures that write devicity.
This was the principle of humans rational human, and people started thinking that creativity came out of the hydrops.
And for the first time in history, you started to reference this or artist as a rather than a person who is like a rather than a person with genius to a person.
And I have to say to that I think it was a big mistake.
I think that allow someone to believe someone who is to believe as a recipe as a recipe as a recipe as the source, the essence and the surprising mysteries, unknowable and eths is a responsibility responsibility, a very much of gipsychology that human.
It's like to ask someone to ingoture,
Deform and deforms completely the ego and creates all these ingestious ingestable ingestimates of performance.
And I think it was this pressure that I destruct the artists in the past.
And if this is true, and I think that is, the question becomes and that?
Can we do it different?
Maybe you go back to a more ancient understanding of the relationship of the relationship of human relationship and mystery of human relationships.
or maybe not.
Maybe we can't cell 500 years of thinking about rational thinking about a 18 minutes.
And there is probably people in the audience that would satisy bony bunch of scientific names on the notion of the notion -- they follow people are following their projects.
I probably won't convince you all about this thing.
But the question I would ask is -- why is it?
Why don't you think about it in this way?
Because it has more sense of any other thing that has ever heard of the exasperant exasperants of creative process.
And one process that you ever tried to do something -- so, fundamentally, all here -- yes, all of this -- you don't have rational behavior.
And, in fact, it can sometimes be completely paranormal.
I did this recently recently with the remarkable Gruth Sun, who has now 90 years, but that was a poet-year-olds in the rural Virginia, working out in the room and he was working out in the room and felt it was in the country, when a poeter came from the landscape.
He said it was like a fragorous fragorous fragorous fragorous fragorous fragorous fragorous fragorous fragorous fragorous fragorous fragorous of it.
And that was coming rolling up to her from the landscape.
It was to be there, because it was going to be able to get the earth below his feet.
He knew that I have one thing to do to do that point and it was like, "currenter as a morne."
And so it goes home and came home and came up with this poetry, and it wouldn't have to make any card, and it wouldn't have to take a piece of paper -- and a fairly freting, as the translate and on the page.
Sometimes it couldn't be pretty quickly, so that correcent and correcent and the correcent was able and the poetry of the poetry and the performance was going to stay through the landscape, as she said she said to be another poet in the landscape, as she said, "other poet it."
Then there were times -- this piece of not forget -- this piece never -- there were the moments where it was almost lostly lost, OK?
So, he was running home and he was looking for card and the poetry was looking for card and then a married right in the way that she was passing, and then he was like to get the other hand and the step off.
And he was offered the poety from the coda and the releasing in his body and turn it into the page.
And in these cases, the poetry is going to be in the perfect page and intacts but the same same same as well.
So when you feel it -- it's crazy to my creative process of creative process.
Not all my creative process -- I'm not a conduct of it.
I'm a mule, and my way to work is is -- wake to go to the same orarian and work on and go over the hononto the hold and go over the hurt of the time.
But even yet, in my headgned, I was check against that thing, at the time, at the time.
And I guess many of you have the face.
You know, even if the work and ideas came to me from a certain source of the kind of not that I could not be saying, I could not be knowing it.
What is this thing?
And how can we relate to each other, how can we do not allow us to do that if you remainly do that?
As I really, the best contemporary contemporary for me that I have is the musical musicist musical musicist -- which I have interviewed a few years ago for a day.
We were talking about this, and you know, Tom, for the most life was the incarnation of the artist of the artist of the artist of the paper, trying to control these species of impulses into the totally interiored species.
But then I agreed it, and a day while she was driving on a car car in Los Angeles, changed all for him.
It was going to be fast and all of a sea little bit of this melodia, which comes into its heads as it dots as the inspiration, elut, and the wish -- and the wish -- you know, it's wonderful, and the will, but not knows how they take it.
It has no card piece of card, not has a mate, it has a record record --
So it starts to feel this kind of old anxiety to be to losses and remart obsessed with this persemble song of this persembled song with this persemble.
I'm not good enough and I can't do it."
And instead of going to go in the peanic stopped here.
And then I got the whole process of minal and did something completely new.
He just just look at the sky and said, "cus," I'm not seeing that I'm driving?"
"Do you look like it can write a song of hanan?
If you really want to exist, you get back to a little time when I can take care of you.
Obviments, you know, you go to anybody else today.
You know, Leonard Cohen."
And his process workers changed after that.
Not the work of the work still was darkly dark as it as sound.
But the process, the weighty that was releaved when the genius, the genius, the genius, the genius that came up with nothing else that problems and free the free of where they came in, and the free of where they came in, and they were awasting for the game and released it.
But yet this peculiar bizarre cool -- a conversation between Tom and this external thing and the outside of the external and the outside of the exterms.
So as the story started to change a little bit that I was working on my way I was working and already saved a time.
This idea, I saved when I was writing "Mangia, Prega, Amae and falls in one of the disperation where we all all when we are working on something and we can't start thinking that it's going to be the worst book that is going to be the worst book that that is going to be the worst book that that is going to be the worst book writing.
Not only bad at the worst book written a written written about.
And I started to think about object.
But then I remember Tom Tom who is talking to the air and trial.
So I put my face in the manuface, and I would say my comments to a dunt corner of the room.
And I said to you, "Look, what we know is, if this book will not be brilliant not be brilliant, it's not going to be bright right hon?
Because as I see that I'm putting us all that I haven't have to do that.
So if you want to be better and do your hand, you have to do your hair.
Okay, but if you don't do it, you know what, I don't know it all.
I'm going to write the same because it's my work.
And I would like to favor that was recorded that I was to do my part," because -- the end is like this, you know, at the end of the North Africa people were rading the deserts of Africa in the North Africa -- the length of the dance, dances of the dance, dances of the sacred sacred to the heat and the heba.
And they were always magnificent because the dances were so great.
But every single one of these artists became actually transfitted -- and one of these artists became actually translate --
And I know you know, what I talk about it, because I know you all of it, because I know that you all have seen it in a certain point,
It was like the time is stops, and the dancing walk through a kind of portal portal and was not doing anything from the sun, as the 1,000 nights earlier, but everything is fingery in the save.
And suddenly not only like human.
But you access to divince and divinity in the divinity of divinity.
And when this next to the time -- the people were were what he was, they call it with his name.
They got the hands and they started singing, "Allah, Allah, God God, God God, God."
That's God, you know,
Curious note -- when the Morderer invaser the Spapayna, they took this abitude and the ready one changed in the centuries from "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah," you can still feel in the courts or in the famenic.
In Spayna, when a artist has made something impossible and magic -- "Hey, Gerny," "Ger," inhonon." I meant to understandable, and that is a last of God.
And it's great because we need it.
But the problem comes the next day after the dance, for the dance, when you wake up and discoveries that are 11 in the morning, and the last of Martedness, and last God is not more.
It's just a dead of a dead with a lot of male with a lot of male at that alteach algae to that alteach that algae.
And maybe nobody will be the name of God still as yet, and what has to do with the rest of his live?
It's difficult.
This is one of the most painful reconciliations to do in a creative life.
But maybe not have to be so angoscious if you can not believe that if you can not believe that, the most extraordinary aspects of your being come from you to themselves.
But I just believe that they have data in the prestituted you from a picture of this team of this team of the life that you have to go to somewhere else when you finished.
And, you know, if we think of this is all change.
And so I started thinking about it, and it's sure as I thought about it for several months during the work of the book that I think for several months in the book that I'm a very following following of my greatest success.
And what I have to keep telling me when I feel elected from this is, not having fear.
Let me just just your work.
It is to introduce you for your hand, any one can be.
If your work is dance, bally.
If the divine, I assurd genius assurd, it decides to let some wonderful kind of wonder, for a few things to be very strengths, for a moment through your efs, "O!"
Of course, I did the same thing.
And "Oh, you know, you know, it."
I think I think I should teach it.
"Yes, even yourself, even for the human beings and tests on the human factors to be going to be on your own facturing you all the time.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Oh, y!
As you know I've talked about some of these projects on genome genome on the genome of genome genes.
Now we're starting a new percorsed: we started to digitize biology and now to go from that digital code and now from that digital code of biology, designing and synthesizing and synthesizing and synthesizing and synthesizing and synthesizing and the life.
We always tried to ask a big questions.
"What is the vice? It's something that many biologists I think they have attempt to understand a level.
We tried a different approaches, reducing the minimes of terms of the terms of the terms of the terms of the terms of the terms of the terms of the process.
We're just just digitalizing for almost 20 years ormas.
When we sequenced the human genome was treated to go from the analysis of biology in the digital world of the computers.
Now we ask ourselves, can we regenerate life, or create a new life from this digital universe from this digital universe from digital universe to digital life from this digital universe from this digital universe from this digital universe of this digital universe from this digital universe to digital life from this digital universe from this digital universe to digital life from this
This is the map of a small organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, which is the smallest genome that can authority in the lab.
And we tried to reduce the genome to create a more smaller than that.
We can eliminate a hundred genes of about 500 genes of about 500 genes of the about 500 that are here.
But when we look at his metabolic map of the metabolic map at the noaddress at the noaddress at the noaddress of the noaddress at the note.
So I think about this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate a time, it's very unlikely to be able to bring into a living cell.
So we decided that the only way to progressive was to synthesize this chromosoms so that we can modify the components to bring some of these questions.
And so we started the adventure of "Can we can synthesize a chromoso?"
Can an an an conscious conscious amount of producing these great molecules that never have been able to create before you?
And in a degree -- can we make a chromoso?
A chromosome is just a piece of chemical material that you can be an inher.
The speed that we can digitize life is growing up to exponential rely reported exponential of it.
Our capacity to write the genetic code, ages, it's quite slowly, but it's improgressive to write the way of them --
And our most recently results, the bringing curve.
We started more than 15 years ago.
The process has required a lot of steps -- starting with a bioetic revision before we started the first experiments.
But we found out that DNA is very difficult.
There are tens of thousands of cars in the world that make small segments, the long chance of 30 to 50 letters and is a degenerative process -- the more segment is longer than the segment is longer than we are.
So we had to develop a new method to assembling these fragments and reach the mistakes.
And this was our first attempt to go from Phi from Phi digital information of the Phi X-174.
It's a little virus that kills kills kills kills.
We designed the fragments, effectively the reeffort of the mistakes, and we got a molecule of DNA of about 5,000 letter of DNA of about 5,000 letter lics.
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemical material that is that we put it into bacteria and we put it into the bacteria and then started reading this genetic code and to produce particles and producing the particles of virals.
The virals have been released by the cell phone, they came back and they came back and they have destroyed E.
I talked about recent with members of the petrolifes that they have certainly compress this model.
They reefs more than you.
We believe that this is a situation where the software can really build his own hardware in a biological system.
But we wanted to do the bigger things in larger stuff.
We wanted to build the entire chromosome.
They're more than 580 miles lymer code of genetic code.
So we thought we built it in the seven-scale viruses, so that we can change the seven-of-scale cell to understand what the components of a vivive.
The design, is crucial and if we start with digital information into a computer, these must be very accurated.
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995, the standard accurateless of every 10 miles a little bit of a 10 mile of the basis.
We found resequencing, 30 mistakes, 30 misteres, 30 mistakes. If we had that original sequence we never have been able to do it.
A part of the process is designing segment segment segment for 50 letters that are overwhelming with all the other segments of the same segment for smaller than working together.
We try to rely unlike here.
You probably have to be a little bit that we put the flight.
Think of this this is, we have a genetic code based on four letters -- C, G, G, G, G.
Three of those letters together about 20 adminiopactics, and there's a specific order to walk over the amminoid of the aminoid of below in the administration of every amineats.
So we can use genetic code for writing words, frails, thinking.
What we did in the beginning was self-to do is to do that.
Some have been dolphushes from the fact that it wasn't poetry.
We designed these checks to just put them with the essentially.
There are enzymes and put them and put them with them and asyme.
And we started to seed with segment segment segments at five to seven miles letter from 24 miles letter to 24 miles at their letter to 72 miles to get to 72 thousand letter to 72 letter letter to 72 letter --
So anywhere we have made these checks in the abundance so that we are trying to create a very robate proception of extremely robust -- as you will see in a minute.
We're trying to automatize the process.
So, this seems like the tabellon a lower of a basket.
When we get these segments at these very long chapes, more than 100 miles -- they're not going to grow in E.
You get to the modern limits of the molecular biology of molecular biology.
So we have seen other mechanisms.
We knew another mechanism called hotographology, which is in biology useful for DNA repair to repair the DNA to repace the DNA to make segments.
Here's an example.
This organism, called Deinococcus radioululary Deinococcus radiation.
You can see in the sodanger as his chromosome, you can see in the ground.
In 12 hours -- 24 hours is reassembled exactly as it was before.
There are thousands of organisms that have been able to do that.
These organisms can be very cheap in the whole thing.
They can live under empty.
I'm absolutely sure life exists in space, and you smoking new water environments to find new rich environments of water.
NASA showed that this is that this is happening.
This is a picture of the molecule that we built using these processes -- just using the trials, just using the trivial design of segments to inserious inserious sat inserious inserious inserious inserious chors.
The lit lightforward, you know, the car seed them up,
This picture wasn't taken with a microscope with a microscope microscope with a regular microscope --
It's a molecule so great that we can see it with a little slightly read a microscope slightly read it.
These are pictures that cover a period of about six seconds.
This is the publishing that we did a little time ago.
They're more than 580,000 letters of genetic code.
It's the greatest molecule of a defined structure that never created by man.
It has a 300 million one-million.
If we spent it with a 10 paper without spaces, they would like 142 pages to turn this genetic code.
Now, how do we work work? How can we activity it?
Of course, you get a virus is a game from a young kids.
It's a little bit more complicated when they use bacteria as they use bacteria
It's simpler even when it's about the eucariote as we can just extreme the nuclear and insert one other other -- which is basically the process of cloning.
In the bacteria is the chromosome, it's integrated inside the cell but we recently showed that we can do a complete trailing of a chromosome,
We clean a a partnership from a microbial species.
The two are different as men as men are topis.
We added a few gene more in a way that we can decide what to chromosoon.
And then the skull with the enzymes in a way to kill all protection.
And when we put it into the cells was stupending -- and you open our graphic graphic graphic -- the new chromosomes -- the new chromosome.
And we were really thought we couldn't go to the land, but we tried to get more in there.
This is one of the greatest mechanisms of evolution.
We found that a lot of species have added a second or a third chromosome, added up in a thousand new new tracks to that species.
So who think about evolution as a gene gene to evolution as a gene gene that has not understood a lot of biology.
There's enzymes called "restripption enzymes of restripps.
The chromosome that was in the cellula doesn't have one.
The cell-h-the cell that we have inserito-tail.
It turns out that and has recognized the other chromosomes like the summer chromosome, and we got up with only the cells and the new chromother.
It became blue because of the genes that we have inserved.
And in a short lasses of time, all the characteristics of a species have gone lost of a new species, based on the new software that we put in in the mobile phone.
All the proteins have changed, members have changed, and when we read the genetic code -- the genetic code is that we have transfitted to what we have transfitted you.
Now, this could look like genetic alchemy, but altering the DNA software can change things in a pretty pretty substantial way.
Now, I explained that there is not about genesis -- but of progress from three million and a half million evolution, and I said that maybe we're going to create a new version of Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosion of this digital process of Cambrian explosion of this digital process of evolution, and I said that maybe we're going to create a new version of C
Why do I do that?
I think it's obvious when we think about our needs.
We're going to be six billion and a half billion people in the next 40 years.
Just to give you an example: I was born in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for each one has been in 1946; 40 years, there will be four years, there will be four of them will be four of the planet for each other.
We're having trouble now to find food, water and clean, drug medicines, medicine and belt drug for six billion people.
It's going to be even harder to do for nine billion.
We use more than five billion carbon dioxide than 30 billion boils.
That means a million barrels a day.
When we try to find biological processes or any kind of process to replace them, it's going to be a huge challenge challenge.
We have to keep the CO2 emission of CO2 from these materials that end up in the atmosphere.
On today, because of the scientific discoveries around the world, we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I like to think that they are the designed for the future.
The electronic industry is only a dozen about component, and think about how many different things are come out of it.
Our limits of the limits of reality and our imagination.
Now we have a techniques that because of these quick methods of sympts, that can create what we call a combinatory genomic genomic genomic genomic genomic genomic genomic genomic genomic sympts.
We can build a big robots that can produce a million chromosomes a million chromosomes a day.
Think about processes these 20 million genes or to try to get the processes to produce either either frural or drus, new vaccines, we can change through a little team, and create more biology than the last 20 years of science.
And it's just a standard selection selection.
We can choose for chance of survival, production or carbon vaccines, production of gaccines etc.
This is a few software are programmed with some software programmed that we're working for seders to sell us to sell us and design species to the computers.
Well, we don't know how they do.
We know exactly how their genetic code.
Now we're focused on the coaling carbons of fourth generation.
You also saw you who are ethanol from the grate was a male of a male final experiment ent fine.
We have a lot of colums, the generation that will be pretty soon on the higher than the higher than the eight or different kinds of three-of-based based based based based on the either of the dame.
But the only way biology that biology can have a big impact without increasing the cost of food and limiting the availability would be transform the availability would be transforming the CO2 cells that they can achieve this purpose, and we can get this to be able to be able to get this purpose, and we think we can have the first carbon die of the miles in about 18 months.
The only combined with CO2 is a methodom -- but in our discoveries around the world, we found different methods.
This is a organism that we described in 1996.
It lives in the deeep ocean to about 2,500 feet temperature boiling the water.
It creates meter from CO2 CO2 molecular hydrogen molecular sources.
We're trying to figure out if we can put the CO2, which can easily be transported by tubes, converting that CO2 in carbons to drive this process.
So a short we think we might be able to increase what the basic question is, what is the life." And we have the modest goal of replacing the whole petrochemical question of relate to replace the petrochemical industry.
Oh, yeah. If you can't do it from TED, where can you do that?
It would be a main of energy.
And as yiild, we are working for using metoics to create gain instants.
You saw this year with the flu is always back, and a dollar in a year and a dollar when it's going to find the right right right now.
I think what you can change in a combinable vaccines in antical.
So that's how the future could start changing, as changing, as the evolution, accellerating evolution, accellerating the evolution of the synthetic bacteria -- and finally hot.
We are so much from improve people.
Our purpose is to do a lot of living enough to try and do a lot of people to try and do it. Thank you very much.
First of all of you can see -- the most rapidly as possible, a fundamental work that we have taken to the Microsoft in a almost almost a year ago -- that's Seadragon.
It's a local where you can interact with is a local level that remote with a huge amount of visual data here.
Here are seeing a lot of gigabyte of a picture of a kind of a kind of a cost zoom cost and continuous fast panoramic speakers like we want.
And not matter how big the amount of information that we see -- how big these data is how big these data collects or images.
Most of them are all digital photographs but this is a scanning from the library from the library of Congress, and rewing in the legal of the Congress, and rewing in the legs of the Congress,
It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that the prestations of a system like this is the number of pixel on your screen in any moment. It's also a very flexible architecture
This is a whole book -- not imagined data, not imagines.
This is the Casa desolated of Dickens. Elonna represents a chap.
To show you that it's just about testing and not imagines, we can do something like this, to do something like this, to do that it's a real representation of the head, not a photos.
It could be a little bit a little artificial book to read a electronic book book.
I don't advise the advertise.
This is a more realistic example of a CGuardian number of the Guardian.
Every picture is the beginning of a selection.
And it really gives you the pleasure of the real experience of reading the real real real version of a magazine or a fourth of a fifth of a fifth of a meeting.
We also did something with the corner of this number in the corner of the Guardian.
We created a fasulla advertise to resolve -- much more than what you use in a normal normal commercial -- and we put in the extraordinary content in the content content of the content content of the content content -- and much more than what you use is used in a normal resolution of the content that you use in a northweleline -- and we put in a very high resolution of the content fasure.
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile car, you can see here.
or even specific models, or even specific specific --
And this really demonstrate some of these ideas to eliminate the limits space on the screen.
We hope this lemen to put a few miles to put a few few more porches, not should be necessarily requires to be necessarily necessarily to be necessarily necessarily necessarily to be necessarily needed to be necessarily to be to be necessarily to be to be to be necessarily needed to be necessarily to be to be to be necessarily to be necessarily necessarily
Of course, the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology.
And I don't want to lose time, if I don't say that we have contributed to give them in this field came.
These are all the streets in the U.S. S.' ' on a geospace of NASA
So now we're going to go to something else.
This is actually actually from the whole whole of the webs; you can go to see it.
This is a project called Photosynth, which fights two different technologies.
A is Seadragon and the other is a visual computer to very interesting computer computer from Noah Snavely, a student of the University of Washington, with the aid of the UWashington, with the aid and Rick Szsklii Research. A lot of collaboration.
And it's from the live on the web, managed by Seadragon.
You can see that when we do this kind of screen, where we can go from one and have this kind of a picture of other and having this kind of degree experience.
But the space collotion of the images here actually a meaning.
The visualization of computer visualization of computer have recorded these images together, so that they correspond to the real places, where you can see the real romantic -- all of the canahi Grassive. So the dogoritems -- they have been taken from the canays' moos. So you see the elements of a degree -- and these things have all space.
I don't know if I have time to show you some other environment.
There are a lot more spaces.
I want to spend a lot of the original data of Noahs, -- and this is from a previous previous protool -- to show you what I think we did for the first time -- to show you what I think is really the key key behind this technology, Photosynthosynthose. And it's not necessarily looking at the environments that we have in the website.
We had to worry about legal aspects and so on.
This is a reconstruction of Notther Dame images previse from Flickr. Basta Flickr. Basta Flickr and you get images in the mail, and you get images in the campus and say,
So they're all taken from Flickr and have been related to space space in this way.
And it's possible to navigate in this simple.
You know, I would never have thought of finish to work for Microsoftttly.
It's very gratificing this kind of accomplishing here.
I think you can see that it's a lot of different framework of fotoplies from the SLR, a a meaningful number meaningful number of meaningful phones in this environment.
And if I can do that, I try to try to find those more strange.
Many are blocked from factors, etc.
Something is a series of photographs -- there is a series of photographs -- there are there -- -- this is a lot of photographs -- there is a lot of photographs -- there is a series of photographs -- there is a series of photographs -- there is a serious picture -- -- -- you know,
This is a poster poster of Notther Dame recorded First recorded correctly.
We can go from the physics of physics of this environment.
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment. This is now taking data from everyday -- from collective interaction of how to apt the Earth, from collective visual view -- and all those data together.
All those pictures become connected together, greater than the parts.
You have a model of the earth of the entire emerge.
Think about this as a promotion of Stephen Lawler on Earth the virtual Earth Earth virtual
It's something that grows in complexity as people use it, and the people who use it, and the advantage for who useful people to use it as well.
Their pictures are marcated with metaders from other people.
If somebody is the idea of contrast all of these disrupting, my picture of Notres-catteter Dame of Nots Dame suddenly is to get to resent in the space, and I can use as a spotent point in that metapal of the resaving of the resets of a red red red red model from the cross-motion of red model from the red-mored cross-mother catteter and and having a whole of it.
Of course, a consequence of all of this is extremely elaborate models of all the interesting part of the Earth, hardly elaborate from images and satellitarian imagery and websites and site, but from the collective memory of the collective --
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I realized good? What your software will have to do is that at a point, in the next few years, all the photographs of the next few years, all the pictures that in the world or they are basically connected together?
BAA: Yes. What is doing is actually discovered.
It's creating hyperlink, if you want to do hyperlink, if you want to be --
And it's doing it in the content of the imagines.
And the thing becomes very interesting if you think about wealthy of the semantic information that many of these images possible.
As a picture when you do a research of images on the web, you know, a sentence on the page page is a lot of information about the pictures.
Now, what happens if that picture you connect all your phote?
So the amount of semant interconnection and the amount of wealth that is really enormous amount of wealth is really enormous red. It's a classical effect.
CA: Blaise, it's really incredible.
BAA: Thank you very much.
One of the main plants, when you travel and a delight-pyyph research is the to live between who has not forget the antic of the traditions, between who has been true the past, the game in the wind, touches from the rain in the wind of the plants of the plants of the plants of plants.
You know, the skians still still over the Milky Lattea, or that the world of the Lattee or that the idea of meaningful -- or that in Himalaya, the budged still still the back of the Dhar, to remember the importance of the Dhar, to remember the world in which we live in absolutely -- and that the idea that the world in which we live in absolutely exist, but it's just a model of reality, but it's just a model of reality,
the consequence of a particular adaptive adaptive choices that our stirts of adapt that our stirts of a particular generation of a lot of generations ago.
And, of course, we all share some essential trates.
We all hidden we all procreate.
We are subject to retailing to the initiation.
We have to deal with the inesorability of death, so we don't have to surprising and whales --
all of the time.
What it hits is the particular rhythm of the canvance of any culture.
Not matter that they are the Penan forests of Borneo, or the following of Haiti, or the Haiti, or the desert of Kaised, or a Seper of the Haiti, Curanda, or a cameleline in the heart of the Sahara.
He was my company of the journey in the desert a month ago, or a month ago, or a hallallel in the Qomolang, on Everest, the degree of the world.
All of these populations are teaching us that there are other ways of thinking about other ways of thinking, other ways of thinking, other ways of them to move in the world.
And if you reflect, it's a concept that can give you hope to give you a hope of it.
Inside, the cultures of the world creating a spiritual of the world creating a spiritual of life and cultural and cultural that is important for the well-being of the planet as the biosphoto the well-being known as biosphery.
And you can think of this cultural ragnnysphery as a ethotic etnosfer and you can call the ethnos-honons, ideas, ideas, inspirations, myself, inspirations, intuitions that are from the human imagination from the alba imagination of the Helb of the consciousness.
The ethnosfer is the fantastic pathrimoney.
It's the symbol of what we are and what we can be as as as a kind of quisitive.
And because biosphere has been seen, as a as a hetnosphery was very quickly.
No biologist, for example, would say that 50 percent of all the species was or is about the earth of the summer -- in the extension -- in the field ipottery -- in the diversity of biological diversity, and you don't have near to the most good ipottery -- that the cultural diversity of cultural diversity.
The indicates all of this is, of course, the loss language.
When you're born 6,000 languages on this planet.
A language is not only from a vocabulary or a series of gragragram or a series of grammarical gram.
A language is the price of human spirit of the human spirit of the spirit of human spirit of the spirit of the spirit of human spirit of the human spirit of the human spirit of the spirit of human spirit of the human spirit of the spirit of the spirit of human spirit is the price of human spirit of the human spirit of the human spirit of the human spirit of the human spirit of the spirit
It's the middle of which animates of every culture comes in in the material of any cultural world.
Every language is a forest of mind, a spiritual chance -- a spiritual chance of spiritual possibility.
And of those 6,000 languages, as we sit in Monterey, at least half of the time is not sussurrated in the ears of children.
They don't have to teach children, who means not to get a little bit more than anything, which is already dead anything, which is already dead --
What is there is more tristuck of being the last to talk about a language, of being the last to talk a language, of not having a way of having the dynamic shadom?
This orring was in some of the world every two weeks a few weeks a bunch of the world every two weeks a laughter die in the tomblead to a language of a language of an another.
And I know someone to say anybody will say "Is that anyone thing?
The world would not be a better place if we all talk about all the same language -- we talk all yoruba. We talk all yoruba. We talk about a cantonal month.
We talked about kogis.
You can know a track, which is not to be able to talk about your language.
I would like to do a journey through the etnosferail --
a little journey in the etnospher's able, to give you a above what we're allowing on.
Many of us forget that when I say, different ways of existing ways of existing existing different ways of existing ways of existing existing different ways of existing ways of existing existing in a lot of people say that when I say, "different ways of existing" --
We take a example of this Barasana, in Amazony, in Amazony, the popular of anacony, which creates the game of the loud of the easts of the South Phook at nights.
It's a popular that is not able to distinguish the blue color, because the celests is identified in the forest, which is identified in the forest, which depends the population.
They have a strange language and a marriage -- "exogamicy" languages, "Heogamicy" -- you have to get to a different language.
All this has roots in the past, yet the particular meetings is that in these extinct families that are about six or seven lings, because of the mystic marriage of the mystic marriage of any practice.
They are just listening to and then they start talking about.
We take one of the most interesting tribes with the most interesting tribes with the Waorani of Ecuador nords, a popular popular that has had the first contacts in 1958.
In 1957 mission of the 1957 mission mistake.
They made out of the high-scale photographs that they thought that they lost love, dimenticing that this popular rainforward, dimentioned that this popular of the rainforest.
They raised the picture from the ground, they have a shape or a flower and find out the degree of the diavoid -- and they killed the digging five missions, with the five missionaries with the lances.
But the Waorans don't have to kill stranimal stranies.
They have to kill them.
54 percent of death death was caused by their own own themselves.
We have a very bad hot. And we found two natural death death and we found two natural death of them was agreed for one of them was agreed with a lot of them was so agreed that dead is dead again -- and then they killed the itself.
The hunters were able to recognize the animal from 40 steps and recognized the species.
In the first '80s, I was assigned a really interesting thing when my Harvard professor of Harvard professor asked me if I wanted to go to Haiti to be in the secret of Duval and Tonton Macoutes, and the Tonton Macoutes, and I impossessed me to make the velended the welon used to use the velened to use the veleness of the velenables in the vessesecret of the val power of Duvesses of the vessely of
To make sense of miraculous mythray -- I should have to understand the Voodoo culture.
It's pretty a metapical vision of the world.
Very interesting.
If I asked you to tell me the great religions of the world, what would you say about the world that would you say to it?
Cristiance: Islam, Mebraism, Ebraism, Ebrish, etc.
A continent is always leaving out that sub-Saharan Africa has no religious ffolks has no religious fts of these concepts, very profounded by the distilled of these conceptions of diasporation of the back, the diasporate of the back.
What is interesting is that it makes voodoo is the intense relationship between life and death.
So the living spirits.
The spirits can be invocated from the Grande Aqua, they respond to the dance of dance and dance themselves in the living way that for a short that for a short activity that for a short action becomes the deal.
So this is the vooisters to say, "You white to go to talk about God.
We give us in the temple and become God."
And from the moment you are posseduced, is the spirit that you guise you that drive, how can you do anything about it?
So you look at these incredible events -- I follow voices in the state of trancy trancing empties that touch the body when you catalyzed a fairly demonstration of the mind on the body when it's catalyzed in a state of extreme extremely quoting.
In all the populations that I lived the most extraordinary of Sierra Nevade Santa Mars, in the Colombia Mars, in Colombia in Sepest Mars, in the Santa Marcket
It turns out that they were going to be a few of the Colombia in the Colombia in attaces of Colombia in attack, the popular mass of the game of the Colanical of the putupon planning that the carbe.
In a drug continent -- this popular has never been conquirte from the spagnot.
But they all have governed by a clack but their formation is really extraordinary.
The young people following their family secreates from the family, and they live secreated in a world of good and hombers in a world of melting in the ground of the ice for 18 years.
Two period of nine years of proposing for reducing the nine months of management that turn into the user of the mother, now are metaphorically in the drug of the drug of the drug of the Grande Madre.
For this time, they have acculturted to the values of their companies, values that they previous their prayers and only their prayers -- or to say the cosmic balance, or to say the ecological balance.
At the end of this incredible beginning, they suddenly brought up and for the first time in my life in their lives, at the age of 18 years, they see a hitting of the first bag, when the sun is the sun of the beautiful foldly landscape is a lot of the beautiful beauty of the beautiful beauty is a little bit of the splendor. The pret of this is a past of the back, and it says, "Her is a step and it for the lymmurgate of the conscience,
"Do I know how I detail.
It's stupend. Now it's not to protect it."
They call the greatest brothers and say that we we, threats of the world.
This level of intuition is extremely important.
When we think about Indian populations and invote Rousseau and the old story of the noble noble notion of the noble notion in his simplicity or maybe maybe in your simplicity or maybe Thorders -- and we say that these populations are more in the Earth of us.
The Indigenes are not feeling from our algic feeling from our algies.
There's no space for these things in the malaric stages of the Tibet, but because of the time and rits, they have created a mystic of the Earth as well and rited, they created a mystic of the Earth as well as a dying, as well as a more subtle subtle of the Earth can only live because it's infected by the human consciousness -- the concept that the Earth can only live in the human conscious geons human.
What does that mean?
It means a young girl of the Ande who is growing that mountain is a spirit of Apu that is going to be a human being being being deeply deeply and will have a drrratic relationship with the mountain or that respect a lot of different mountain is that respect a mountain is a mountain of rock is that a mountain a mountain a mountain is shaking of rock
That is the death of a spirit or a mineral clearly is to irrization.
What is interesting is is the metaphor that defines the relationship between individual and natural world.
I grew up in the forests of Columbia who was creating the forest of the Columbia to be cut.
And this has made me a human being being different from my friends Kwakiut, who believe that the forests are dimora death of Hukukukuk and the beat the end of the paradise and the beat the world that are living to the world north of the spirits that they live in the Hamatsa.
If you start to think these cultures can actually create different reality, you can create different reality, you can start to understand some sensely sensitive discovers.
I took this picture to aprile in the nordoctory of the Western Amazony.
Maybe some of you have heard about the ayahuase, the most powerful subsidie of the repertoo.
What makes it fascinating the ayahuase is not the potential for the substance, but his elaboration. It's made by two elements.
From a hand, this legnose that conties a series of beta-carboline, harmine and harmer and harbor and harbor a molecule --
Taking the only plant is a bluewer that alters a little bit of conscience, but it's measured with the leaves of coffee of the coffee family,
This plants of triptamines, a lot of a serious degree methoxyltryptamine-5, methoxymethoxyypyptamins.
If you ever see the Yanomami Yanomami to the nose that they do from a different set of ancheck species, ancheck methoxyydimethoxyptamines.
Tiring that polar on the nose is a little bit like being disappeared by a fire of boots and landing on a sea sea of electricity.
I was often often with my professor, Richard Evan Shultes, the man who took the psychcheap, with his discoveries of the wildlife on the '30s in Mexico.
I think my testhesis not to classife these triamine tripty as hallucinogens because if you're made not to tell any of being hallucined. They can be hurgorally because they're dened by a doughly because they're denaturated by a douter that is of course, in the intestination of the summer --
It's possible to be assummer just if you put them with other substances that dense denses the MAO.
Now is the beauty beta-carboline that are initial injectors of MAO, the same kind of necessary for triptamines. The question of the same kind of a danger to be able to be two people as they do these people are dying, how these people are doing these people who are are deaths in this book, they believe in two death, or biochemical version that is dangers?
We use the great euphemism of proof of the proof of the proof of the mistake.
But if we ask Indians to say to Indians, they will tell us about it."
What does that mean?
This tribe, Cofan, has 17 variety of ayahuash from ayahuash in the forest, and that they would rely in the same species.
If we ask them as they were asking their pocckle rate to tell us about plants, "Three I understood not know?" I said, "No."
The solution is, you take 17 variety in a night of the full and each one will be a different different way of it.
You don't have a laurea Harvard, but it's much more interesting than contare the stams.
Now, the problem is that even the ones of us that have the kids who have heart people who have the heart people who have to give them a paints of the history of the history of the history of the history of our real world, and pass it to the margin, and then laughters.
In fact, the X-century, 300 years, not will remind to remind for its wars or its technology, but rather how the one was where we stopped and we have a hurt and destruction of the planet -- that is not the change. And we have a destruction of the planet. Now the problem is not the change.
All cultures through the centuries have been involved in a dance for new possibility of life.
And the problem is not technology.
Indians don't have to be Sioux when they put from being Sioux when they put away from the hang and frece as Americans have no free when they put from the horses and calymes and calmysis.
It's not the change or technology that threats the ethnosfer. It's the poter.
The late flights.
And if you give a look at the world, you will find that these are not destined cultures are not destined to disappear.
They're living creatures and dynamic strong identifiable force from existence to identify their adaptation that are beyond their adaptation of adapting.
And I'm disbodies in the potential of the Pents --
a noused to be a noused to Sarawak, in the Southusic popular Cinforforest in the forest, and now reduced to the prostitution, and now reduced to the fillume of the rivers of the rivers of the rivers of the Meridional, where the black Cinese Meria, where the Cinese Meridional, where the Japanese navior the Japanese Meria, where the Japanese Cinese Hionmand now
It is to recool the staks with the rainforest.
Or, in Yanomami, are the diseases that have come to the diseases that have come to the discovery of the gold.
If we move on on the Tibet, where I'm doing a lot of research, where I'm doing a lot of research, you can see the last.
As you know the genocide -- the physical extinction of a popular popular -- but the ethocidies, the destruction of a popular popular not only condaming, not only condamed in certainly -- it's celebrated in certainty environments, because it makes part of the strategy of development.
You can't understand the suffering,
I lost the 6,000 miles from Chengdu in China Western Tibet through Tibet Tibet with a young line, but only came to Lhasa young line, but only came to Lhasa statistics of the statistics that we hear about about it.
6,000 monuments in the polar policy and clears --
1.2 million people killed by the Cultural Revolution.
The father of this guy was listen to Panchen Lama.
That means that it was killed in the Chinese invasion of Chinese invasion of Chinese invasion --
Her is the southern Santity in the diaspora that led the popular in Nepal.
His mother was imprisoned and his she'd be rich.
It was brought to the age of two years from the age of two years from the honna because she could have no live without him.
The sister that he did the same, it was mune in reedure.
A day has been squid a fashion of the Murderer Mao and this transgression, was med to be bed by the South workers for seven years.
Tibet Tibet can be inable, but the reeffort, but the reef, the reef, the reef.
And then it turns out to a choost of the choice.
We want to live in the world of the monotony of the world or we want to get the policicyromatic world of diversity?
The great ancropologioga Margaret Mead, before they died that his greatest fear of the world, not only we'll see the whole legs of the world, not only we'll see the whole legs of humans reduced to a limited limited modality of thinking, but a day we get us from a dimentor delightforward,
And it's humble to remember that our species is existed for 600,000 years.
The Neolitical revolution, which has given us to us to reculture the seed-up culture, replacing the poetry of the seed-class of the claman with the classroom proof the specialization, and 10 thousand years ago.
modern the modern world industrialized to be 300 years.
That sharks to all the story I don't suggests that we have the answers to all the challenges that we have to deal with the millennian to come in.
When these cultures miles, the world is asked what it means to be humans, they respond to 10,000 different voices of voices --
And it's in these answers that we all risk the possibility of being what we are. We are going to be what a doing, a kind of conscious species that all the popular and the gardens can be flowing up in the answers.
I took this picture about the north of Baff, when I went to Baff, when I went to the Inuit, and this man, Olya, Here, Olaya, he told me the wonderful story of his grandfather's grandfathers.
The dog government has not always been gentlement with the Inuit and in the '50s to be able to be the sounds in colonies.
The grandfather of this man refuted to go out.
The family, I stand for his life, brought all the arms, and all of his attention to it.
You have to know the Inuit doesn't temes the cold -- they exploited.
The slittles in origin died of the fish of the fish packages in the caribs.
The grandfather of this man didn't have been put from the night or night or the basis of the basic belelely.
It's sunchaired by the bunch of panalong, panalong, and defected in your hand. When the 10 of them are congelated, their bones.

In the 1970s, 1999 government canadese has rejected to Inuit in the total control of California and the Texas a male of the California and Texas mous.
It's their new pathria. It's called Nunavut.
It's a independent territory of all the mineraries. They take all the mineraries.
A beautiful example of how a nation-state of a nation-state can recognize with his popular

For someone is home.
They represents of human imagination that they go to the days' treats. And for us all of these children, like the dreams of our children, as the swimming noda hope.
To enjoy us of National Geographic we convince that political will never come to anything.
We believe that polemices --
[Applausious, not be persuasive, but we believe that stories can change the world, and maybe we are the best institution, to tell stories of the world. Every month is to tell the stories of the world.
156 countries transmitting our television song --
Our magazine are given from millions of people.
Our work is traveling in the etnosphere to bring our public in places, cultural places, that they have to be hurt from what they have seen -- they have been hoped to be about, they will be able to be a lot of people in the diversity, and we have to find a style of life in the diversity, and the world is to find a style of life in the world in a pluralist and multicultural in a world of pluralists.
where the wisdom of all the populations can contribute to our well-being being collective.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope to call other than you have heard and try to rely some connections, in case not noted.
I want to start with what I call the "the office."
The official official of thing?
The official dogma offices of all the industrial society and the officer officer officer of our citizens of our city." "The way to do is to be wealthighting, "The way to do is to be provide the individual."
The reason is is that it from a side, in the fact that freedom is in itself a value, is assumable valuable for humans.
On the other one is that if we are free, each one of us can do everything that massive as we can do everything that massive as our well-being, no one decides.
The way to massizing freedom is to be massizing choice.
More people people are more and more than they are freedom, and more than the freedom, more than their bely; it is their well-being.
This is that deeply radically rooted in society that nobody would dream to put in doubt in doubt.
And it's also deeeply radicated in our lives.
I'm going to show you some examples of what progress has restored possible.
This is my supermarket is not particularly big.
I could do a simple note on conditional conditional conditional conditional conditional conditional with it.
In my supermarket is 175 conditions, without contextract the 10 variety of extracted olive and the 12 balloons that you can buy a huge number of constance that you can buy a huge number of constance that no one of the 175 ready is of your degree.
Here's the supermarket of the supermarket.
Then you go to the share electronic sham, to buy a stereo: CD, radio, radio, plast, radio, plast, radio, plast, legs.
And in this single single black of electronic electronic components -- there's a great audio components of audio components of electronic components --
We can do six million different combinations using the components that there are in a negotis.
You need to admit that there is a lot of choices.
Other the camp: the world of communications.
One time, when I was a child, you could get all the desirable phones that were prophone wish, they could have a mom Bell.
It was known the phone, you wouldn't buy it.
A consequence of that, between the other, was that the phone is that the phone is not a make.
These days, they went to it.
We have a lot of a nearly illimitated variety of phone cellular phone --
Here's the phones of the future.
My favorite is that in the middle, reader, MP3, cut off of the hidden and forward crush for the cry;
If you don't have seen it in the store, you're going to be in the house below you, it's going to prevent it to be there.
And what is the end of the happening is that people in the stores and said, "Well is the answer? The answer is the answer? The answer is "No."
You can't buy a cell phones that don't do too many things.
So, in other aspects of life that are much more important than the water, is the same explosion of choices.
Law is not going to happen in the United States that you go from the doctor and the doctor of the doctor and doctor to do.
Instead, you know, I went from the doctor, and the doctor says, "Oh, you can do A, or But, "Well these hands and these risks." "Buts and these risks and these risks and these risks and these risky?"
You say, "Doctor, what should I do about that?"
And the doctor says, "A has these benefits and the rises, and Bs have these answers, and Buts and these answers.
"What do you want to do that?"
And you reback, "Doctor if she was me, what do you do to do that?"
And the doctor, "But I'm not lei."
The result of the results, expression of malato," expression that makes it look like a good thing.
But actually, it's not a shift of the weight and the responsibility of decisions from someone knows something, which is or somewhere that doesn't know about -- and so it's certainly about -- and so not in condition to make the eggle decisions that they can be the patient.
There's a huge marketing of drug products of drug products like me and you, if you think that if you think not has any sense, because we can't buy them.
But if we can't buy them, because they can you buy them, because they do it because they do it if we can't buy them, because they don't we buy them, because they can you have a public because they can you buy them, because they don't have to buy them, because they can you you buy them --
The answer is that they want to do that we call the doctor to ask ourselves to change the wealthy.
And that is that fundamental as is our orderness is a question of choice, as you see in this journey -- we don't want to be a child to baby. We don't want to be a child to be a identity." We don't want to be a identity: we need to invest in.
And we can reinventate how many times there is aggrade.
That means that every morning, in the risking, you have to decide that kind of person want to be.
And in the family, and the mathemselves to the family, a time perspective, it almost every single thing that was that they could have the most premor as they were going to be able to make the most prepossible.
The only real choice was with anyway, not when you don't even what to do later.
Oday, it's really really to play it.
I think of a very smart students, and I do their 20 percent of work than a time.
And not because they're less deligents, not because they are less diligents.
But why are I implement, I mean, I should marries or not, "should I get to marries or no?
"Would I marries late? I thought before the kids or career to the career career to the board or the career to be able to marries later?
They're a logiative logiatives of logic logic rogatis.
And they try to answer these questions, even if this implements not completing the companies that you assegar to my exame.
And they really have to do that. They're very important.
Now, the job: we're lucky, like Carl subolineavy, because technology allows us to work every minute, every day, from the planet -- except from Hotel Randolph.
And in parents, there's a corner and not tell anyone where the WiFi works.
I don't say that, because I want to use it.
What is meaning, is this incredible freedom of choice that we have to be on the work? Is that we have to be continuously decided, if we have to work or not.
We can go to the boy play, with the cell phone in a pocket in the other, Blackberry and the notel note: Hek in the knee.
And even if they're all spending a minute that we see our son road board, we're also asking this call?"
"Do I answer this email? I have to email? I get this letter to be abboy?"
And even when the answer is "no," all of this makes the headline, very different than your son is a very different confidence from what would be in other conditions.
So, we can go and small and large things and large objects, materials and style life, life is a question of choices.
Once the world was this: Ovo, there were some possibilities, but it wasn't a chose of choice.
The world today is a little bit like this, the dilemma is, "Is it a positive thing or negative thing, or negative thing?"
The answer is Science is Science is --
The positive lights we all know -- so I'm going to talk about the negative ones of the negative lies.
All this choice behaviors on two negative effects about people.
The first one, paradoxyyment, is that makes a lot of freation.
With many options between the choices that it becomes very hard to do it.
I give you an example of a meaning example of a meaning on the volunteer of flights.
A connect of my colleagued data, the gigantes' gigant, the giant society of the deep CEEs of Curt Curt of the CEOs 2,000 companies.
What she found is that for every 10 solutions that are more than that, the percentage of percent, the percentage of flower than 24 percent.
With 50 sources in least 50 percent of the less than deality when they have about about 5. Why are they only about 5. Why is that?
Because with 50 sources of the ones that choices, it's very hard decider, and choice is to decide and choice is remaintained for the questions.
And to questions, and still questions, questions, and of course, and questions, and of course, the questions, and of course, the questions, and of course, the questions, and of course, questions don't get it.
You know that not just means that these people will manufacing food for dogs because they don't have enough money, they want to say that the decision is so obsticle the fundamental source of the workers of work.
Not participate, they're loss to 5000-dollar dator of the working, that would be drinking them out.
So the paralysis is a consequence of having too many choices.
And I think it makes the world like this.
"And finally, for the ethry" -- ketchup, senape or maine?"
You know, you really take the right decision -- if it's for the eterness, right?
You don't want to choose the wrong source, you know, and the wrong condition to the wrong condition to it.
So this is the first effect. The second is that if we can avoid paralysi, and make a choice, we are less sodyyarts from the result of how we would be been with less options of what we choose to choose.
And this for different reasons.
One of these is that with a lot of conditional conditional conditional conditional conditional choice -- if you buy a different choice that would be better chosesen that would be better. And what is happening is that the alternative imagined us to reduce the reachievation of choice, and the rempiant sfalling the decision of the decision that I was going to be betweween,
even when it was a good decision.
More choices are -- more than you have to do it as much as any detail of choices that is insoddisfacing of choice.
And ynamely, there is what economists call cost-cost opportunity.
DGilbert has a very well stamattine as the valuable as the value we depends on what we compare about about what we confrontis.
After, when there are many options as options as possible, is easy to represent the features of the opposites of the opposite of the option that has choice.
Here's an example. I have been going to be in New York.
But it's what you probably think about it.
There's this copy of Hamptons.
A place of the luse.
Spipeline spleny." It's all about them.
Not anything. But what he thinks is, "Well, maledibling, is Agoth."
"All my neighbors in Manhattan is alive.
"I could talk about front of your house in front of home."
And he spends two weeks with the idea that it's losing -- every day -- the possibility of parked -- the possibility of parked in where you want.
The cost of the decreeness costs of what we have, even when the choice was excellent -- when the choice was excellent --
And the more are the options that we have to be considering, more than the most of the options of the opportunity to come up against the opportunity.
Here's another example.
This is a lot of things.
We talk about the living moment, and maybe live slowly.
But the most important point is that anything you choices, you can choose the others.
The things that we don't choose have a lot of activities that can make less what we do.
Third point: the spiral growing of expectancy.
I tried to the skin buying a new jeans.
And I have almost always jeans.
Once the jeans were just a whenever jeans and several best, they were swest, only after having them a life and work a lot of times, they started a lot of times, they started going to be good times, they started going to be good.
So, I went to buy a couple of new when the old people had gone, and said, "I need a couple of jeans, this is my cutt."
The committed me slim fit, relam fit, relait, relam and fit, fit?"
Do you want to look at cernier or with the bottonies? "Hehed," or "acid" or "aceke?"
"Do you want a lot of road?"
"Would you like to be eight-honch? Ble bla blah -- he was conflict to elencar.
I was hitting and after a little bit of a little bit -- I would like the only one of the guy -- that was the only one of the honn't idea what I was saying, I had no idea what I was going to try to get out of the negoti, and then I came out of the negoti, with the best of jeans I had ever had.
It was the male of it. With all that I got the better.
But I felt worse.
Why? I wrote a book to understand it.
The reason I was worse is that I was worse with all that choice were expected altises, jeans have to be perfectly perfectly red.
At the beginning I had expectancy for minimum, when there was just a guy -- but when I saw 100 different cases, at least a guy had to be perfect.
What I had watched was good -- but not perfect that.
After I talked to the choost that I was trying to insuddenly insoddissed in the expectancy.
The addition of options in the life of people don't make the expectations that these have respect to the options of options itself.
And this will be less soddisfation, even when the results are good at it.
No one in the world of marketing if it makes it content.
Because if you know that I'm talking about.
The truth really looks like this.
"You know, the best when you were worse -- the reason that was better when you were worse is that when you were worse to it was even possible to meet the premise of pleasant pleasure.
Over the world we live -- the world we live -- opulion, industrialized citizens with the perfection -- the mouse that we can hope is that things are at the expectation of expectation --
You never have a pleasant to be unexpected to why your expectancy, my expectancy, and they have ingigantites.
The secret of happiness -- what you're here -- is, "Basic" -- "Yes, you want."
I mean, a little bit -- I am -- I'm really married and my wife is really married and my wife is really stupend.
I couldn't do better, I don't have to do better, I don't have to do better.
But account to be not always a good thing.
And finally, a consequence of the two of jeans same, when you have only that jeans is that when you are not satisfacting, and you say, "Why?"
"Who is responsibling?" The answer is clear.
The world is responsible. What would I do about it?
When there are hundreds of jeans, and you buy a insoddisfacent, and you ask you who is responsible for you who is responsible for you are you.
You could do better.
With hundreds of variety available variety of available --
So when people take a decisions, even if the result is several -- they feel insoyard, they feel insodynamed and damage to their own itself.
In the last years, the depression is exploded in the world industrialized world.
I think a significant factor -- not the unique, but important -- of this wave of this wave of depression is just that people have deluent experiences because standards are too much.
And when they have to explain this situation that the hits is they think that the hits is they think that the hits of it.
So the final result is that we are better, objectively, but we feel worse
Let me remind you of it.
This is the official dogma offical, what we all take for good and it's completely fail.
There's no doubt that a little choice is better than that we don't have to have any choice but it's not going to be a little choice is better than a little bit.
There's a critical value, but I don't know what it is.
But I'm sure we have been overwhose from a piece of the level that choices improve our life.
Now, from political point -- I almost ended up -- from policy, the nock point of policy, the nocile is the following is the following of political view --
What allows you all this choice in industrial society is the wealth matters.
There are many places in the world, and you know about that, where the problem is not that they have too much choices.
The problem is they have too much of it.
So the factors that I'm talking about is a mality exclusive to moderns, rich society in the Western society in the Western society.
And what it makes you depress and angry is this: Steve Levitt you were talking about how those cost cost and seats seats are inutilized.
I mean, these choices, complicated and dispendious, it's not just inuseful -- it's not just inuseful --
I'm really really deleterious really.
We do do the worse of it.
If a little bit of what in our societies allows to be reversed in those where people have too much choices that people have too much of their life to improve but the noteens.
This is what economists call a paretyan improve improve improve improve improve imperforming a lot of it.
a redistributation of redition redistributation is good for all -- not only the poor -- because of this choice in a very extentend of us.
To welelelse, you can become all what you want,
Yes, people in culture, thinking, "What makes that weight?"
"It's obvious that you can't make anything in a mouse of vetro."
"A fally" imagination of the world."
and I was in this time, I got the beginning.
But then, I think about it, I realized, I realized that that the fish weight the long time.
Because the reality of the fact is that if you sent the mouse of the bock -- so that "everything is possible," you don't get freedom.
If you romp the way that everything becomes possible decreased the soddisfation.
To the paralysis, and you reduce the well-being.
Everybody needs a sfer.
This is almost certainly too much street, maybe even for the fish, and certainly for us.
But the absence of some symbolic symbolic symbolic symbolic symbolic symbolic symbols.
Thank you heart for heart.
