The last year, I showed these devices to show that the calotter is to show that the calotter of three million years of the size of the size of the size of the 48 percent, you have the stret-percent.
Howey this substitted of the problem because it doesn't expressure that it is not the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice problem.
The glacial article is a certain sense, in a certain sense, the heart of the system system system system of the global system system
You go and sands and rever, and you get the extinct.
The next devices will be a very quickly as a very very quickly that has been in the last 25 years.
The ice lost of the dangers are dealing in the red red.
As you see it on the blue blue blue blue box.
That's the ice in the inver, which is the reveriency of the extinct.
You can see that the ice ice ice ice lost of five years or more, is like the blood of the corporate of the body.
In 25 years of the past, in 25 years of this.
This is a problem because the re-scale problem of the ice ice ice ice of the ocean to the ocean of carbon on on the ocean of carbon on on the microbibizens, they will transformed by microbibibizens, they will transformed by micro-bize.
And I think about the totality of the inquining of global warming, which could double this point of the way of not return.
In some of the deep in Alaska meters is already rebolling from water.
The professored Katey Walter in Alaska was rected with a team of a team of a team of the last death that in the last device.
Video: Wow! The Gor: Life is if we will be going to be going to be us.
A reason is that this scale of the termititself to the Groenlands from the north.
This is a fume to the glacial record of the glacial records of the four.
The ported had never reached to the side.
This is the Kangerlusssua's in the southern of the Groenland, in the Groenlushing on the Groenlussssskill.
If you want to know how the level of the sea chance of the ice of the ice of the ice of the sea.
These are increasing very quickly.
Another of the planet: Antarcticle of the planet.
The month, the scientists have died that the bizarded of the ice is in negative negative and that the Anticicial article on some of the isoles of the slow of the saving of the degrees on the heavy.
Every queer to six feet of the water, like in Groenles.
Himalaya, the third more block of the ice of ice ice ice ice of ice -- you see new laghand, who were ice ice -- they were ice ice ice ice --
The 40 percent of the world's population of the water of the water from what to the proud of the several population
Hells is the founded of the water of water's water's water of this cities.
The portraised is increased.
But when I diminupon water, the same happening water;
In California nees on the Sierra Nevada is diminual of the 40-percent.
The hydrogen is in crisis.
The previsions, like you know, they are gravited.
The growth growing in the world dots in the world dots of the inner of the inner of the inner world
The environment is going to get a re-re-re-re-a-and without precedents.
And so most numbers in the last 30 years of the precedent of the precedent of the precedent of the last 30 years of the precedents.
This is a gand-of the whole insustainable of the insustainable of the insustainable of the insustain.
If you look at the context of the history if you can see the consequences.
In the last five years we added 70 million tons of CO2 and 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the oceans every day.
Well look at the area of the Pacific, from the Amer, and on the Amer, and on the parts of the subcontinent -- where there is a radical of the deal of the ocean in the ocean in the ocean in the ocean in the ocean in the oceans.
The greatest of the global wards of global warming, and the deforestation, which is the 20, is the use of the reforest, is the use of the deforest,
The oil is a problem, and the carbon is lost love,
The United States are one of the most emissions, with the Cina.
And it was propond of a carbon to carbon on carbonon.
But we're assisting a changing changing change.
These are the projects of the last years and some of the proposal and alternative versus of the versus of the versus of the last years and some of the remarkable to the last years and devices.
At every way, there's a lottable in our Paha.
The carbon industry and oil oil has been a 250 million dollars in the last year to promote carbon on the carbon on and the carbon on and the carbon on the last year of the carbon on on the last year for the last year for the last year to promote to promote the last year to promote for promote the carbon on
And this image me to really, I remember something --
Verya, in the Tennesespecially where there was a lost of 3.8 billion military of carbon on and carbon on on the carbons.
Maybe you have seen on the news of the news of the news of the news of the news of the news of the news ars.
This is the second big flush of the largest flected in America.
It was happened around Natellellellow.
The publishing address of a carbon is this:
Video: Look is a cookey is a kind of cool and happy.
It's about the hononto America, and it makes our economy.
Frosty the carbon is always more than it is.
It's good preze, adorable and the work work and the work work of the work work are depended to it.
At Gor: From here is part of the coast of the West Virginia.
The most great society about the mountain is Massey is his friendly ministrator.
Video: Gership: I'm going to be clearly or -- Al Gorder, Harry Reid Reid -- not know what they're talking about.
At Gor: So the Alleance for the Protetion of Clim Clim has been used two pages campaign.
This is a of one of it.
Video: Att: The Aror we see the changes of climate changes like a very few death to our business.
So that our priority is to investigign a great amount of money in a sforce to make public and consequences and consequences and consequences and consequences of the carbon on on the carbon.
In fact, the carbon is not spore.
We think it's a good -- has a good profumms.
So not preocure of climate change.
Let me do it.
Video: Aton Carbone: Carbone -- you heard a lot of it.
So we do a way to a structure of the carbon is about the carbon on the carbon on on the carbon on on the carbon on on the carbon on the sea structure of the carbon on the carbon on on the time.
Straordinary machine are a little roads are a little bit, but this is the suit of the carbon and the carbon is the carbon of the carbon and the carbon is a little bit.
The carbon is between carbon is between the main of the global warming, but the night-technology technology that you see changed technology that you see change.
To o occhiat: This is the odierent technology of carbon is a bit.
At Gor: Infind, the alternative devices to the economic issues and that of the national security.
Video: Comment: The American is in crisi; the economy, the security crisi; the economy, the economic crisi; the economic crisi; the economic crisi; the economy, the security.
The filter that the connection of the dependence from the compounds of the sea and oil oil and oil oil oil and oil oil oil ters.
Now, even though we have a new solutions to use solutions to use it.
In America: 100 percent of energy remain-year-old energy in 10 years.
A pieces to reduce America to work and help us remains, and help us remain-scale scale of global wards the global wards of the global wards the global wards the global wards the report, and help us report, and help us reduce to reduce the global warming of the global war
Finally, a solution that basts to solution our problems.
Scock America. Scocker than that.
At Gor: This is the ultimate one.
Video: Sment: It's about reease to America.
One of the most speakers to the end of the dependence from the recience that kills our planet.
Comparsay: The future is here.
He's got to 2: Novi investment for places for jobs to work for jobs.
Sectu: ReReally America. It's time to be realists.
At Gor: A old proverbio African African East of the speakers from soldiers.
If you want to go back to the hand go together."
We need to go back to the speaker.
Thank you very much.
The last year, I was a introduction on the LHC.
And I promit to the ornate to you on how the machine machine.
So I was that the other time -- the other time I don't have no longest experiment, the most important experiment, I ever tried -- 27 kilometers of circence.
His to reate the reaction of reaction that were less than a billion we were at the beginning of the beginning of the beginning of the second at the second of the second at the second -- to 600 million times at the second of the second of the beginning.
All of that is just the environment of it.
This is the machine in Gevevening.
We take these mini-Big Bang in the reducators.
This is what it was called the ATLAS -- is a 44 and has a diameter diameters of 22 meters.
This is an picture of ATLATLA: you can see this is so you can see the proportions.
The 10 sectors of the last year, we have acceso the first time.
And this picture was taken from ATLAS.
It was because of immen, and it was a control of control.
It's a first fashion particles that had done all the around the LHC, in the LHC, in the LHC, and spread particles in the particles in the re-level.
In other words, when we see that images the 10 sector, we realized that the machine is a great lived that is a great lived in the big lives.
I don't know if it was going to do us to do that when somebody went on Google and vide and vide that the pages was this:
That means that we had a cultural impact of what scientific impact as a scientific impact of what scientific impact as a cultural impact.
And this is a week of a week of the machine in the machine here -- these films here -- these films here -- these films of the fildored.
These files are 13,000 feet when the machine is the massive sexual masside.
Now, the technical technical of you look at the movies and did. I'm not true. I'm going to be too much too much on the time.
And instead, they can do it because when they're very fredency cosident to the super-conducted conducted producers.
So, at least 271 grade, to a temperature temperature in the room between the room between the stellells of the room can bring that out that they can bring that out that they can bring that out that they can bring that out that they can bring that fellellow the room in the room between the stellells of the room in the room between the stellow and the stellow of the room can bring that cell of the stellells can bring that checke.
In one of the most of the most of the most of the nest in the LHC, there was a difed of fabrication.
So the movies are surprising and 13,000 printing of a resistence of a resistence of electrical lived a resistence of electrical resistence of electrical ical ical resistance.
This was the result.
Now, this is still more impressive if you think that these magneters are more than 20 tons in the trees of about 30 centimetries.
They are dannenels about 50 magnets.
We had to take them and what we did is it.
We have repristed and beauty and justed.
Now, they're going to go to the place to the subject to the place on the subject.
English the end of the marst LHC will will be new inteers.
And we accend, and we really really really look at the right or to get the right or to find out what the morning, and continue to find out what the morning, and then we have the universe.
Now, of course, in a certain certain of the way, these incident reaches the debate on the valuable to the debate of science and engineering in front of the conution.
I think that the fact that it's so difficult to go to the limits, I think it's the value of things like the LHC.
I want to end with the parts of a scientist in the Ingland, and the qual, image, image, image, image, image, and image, his pull, his pull, his pull, his pull, his pull, his pullady, his pullll, "Niman is so dangerous for the reenable to the reencies of the human mind of the human res, that are not not going to be a re--re-conversation of our tried by the world-conscience, and they are the constent of the new ideas that are of the new ideencounters, that are the new ideenjoin the new ideencil of our our our re-of the other other other other other other other other other ides of the ideas of the world's ideas, which which which is is is is is is
Thank you.
I want to start to ask you to rethink of how to do you have to go to the morning, played in the morning.
And you can see how to reach them and it makes them them them and then it can actually learn how to think and solving problems, and so much of the relationshiping and so the relationships.
The reasonable reasons is to be connected to the way of the world around us.
So, by inforce the ushed from ushed by the ush of our interaction of our own construction of our collaborators and my collaborators and my collaborators and started asking asking asking on the s' site of the mouse of the mouse of the mouse of the mouse that is a sexual of the mouse of the mouse of the sex information,
and it system?
The question was so interesting that I decided to explore the answer, built the answer, built the answer, built the Siftable.
In fact, a few words, a Siftable computer is a great way of the great as a biquery of a biquery as a biquery of a biscoscoscosco.
In fact, a few words, a Siftable computer is a great way of the great as a biquery of a biquery as a biquery of a biscoscoscosco.
You can move to the hand the man, they can see the right movement, feel the movement and they have a radio wireless and a radio wireless and a radio wireless and a radio wireless.
But the most of course, are objects, as the morning, as the morning, you can just just be able to be just just just just by the morning.
The Siftable is the example of a new ecosystems to the digital information.
And as they become more physics, consciously, consciously, the other movement, and they have more physics, and they know the most physics, and they were consciously, we can explore and how they can explore new and different and functions.
He was going to give you a simple example.
This Siftable is confified to show the video show of video: if you put it in a direction, the video ruoters of the other part of the other part of the other part of the other part of the other part of the other part of the other part of the other part of the other part of the other part of the other part of the other side side of the other part of the other part of the other part of the side of the other part of the side side of the other part of the hit is going to go out out of the other part of the other part of the other part of the other part of the other part of the other part of the the other part of the other part of the other part of the other part of the side of the side of the other side
These are interacties of the others.
If you have to be interesting, you know, it's their intenter: they have to be done.
If they can be circumstances and they can again a little bit of it.
If they can be circumstances and they can again a little bit of it.
They also have their movement, and we have their movement.
And we realized that one of the interests of the interaction of interaction was the community of the common the data, and as if it was a fliquid.
In this case, we have three Sif, as a real skilled as a real skilled and I can use them to confifight them to the central in the central of the central and where they misss' misssset.
and I can use them to save them in the central of the central in the central of the central of the central of the color in the central of the color in the central and I can use them to see.
If we can go back to the way, we can ree a little bit of it.
I'm also good to be good and chance as the mathematical langues, the mathematics and games where people can try and see the things that quickly quickly.
Now I'm --
This is a Fibonacy of Fibonacy programs
Here we have a game of parts that is half between Scarabeo and Boggle.
Pratically, in every turning of the literal received in every Siftable, Prrically, in case on the Siftable, and while if you have a literal in the Siftable, and while you have a dangerous place.
And then, after about 30 seconds of the remissed and have a new new chance to try and new chance to try to try to try and new chance to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try and new possibilities.
Thank you.
So here's what they came to the Middle at the Middle Lab, I made them out and I was a video of video.
And they are loved a lot of it.
And one of the things of this genive to apply is that you don't have to be able to people in the instrumentions.
You just have to say, "Hey, and they know exactly what they do.
So here's how to get it.
This is our own own kid on the younger -- there is deffour.
In fact, it was just just a cut.
They just were going to go to the morning, for himself.
Now, this is an appropriate apation of a cartone interactivity.
We wanted to build a tool, to build a re-instrument of the ling's Flix.
It can insert new characters in the scale of the Siftable to the Sifest and social associated their associated with their associated and the new characters in the scale.
It can insert new characters in the scale of the Siftable to the Sifest and social associated their associated with their associated and the new characters in the scale.
So, it's doing it out of the sun.
Video: The sole is surprise.
David Merrill: Now has taken a treat the scale.
Video: The treatment of the arrang.
Bel job! Y!
So schools Sife Sife and put the neighbors can interaction --
Video: Bau!
And it inventing their own history.
Video: Good hood.
DM: It's a story with the open, and it can decide he can decide his own own own way.
DM: It's a story with the open, and it can decide he can decide his own own own way.
Vulula, I saw the hatt.
DM: The last example I have the time to show you a re-instrument, I made of recently, to be a little bit of music and exeguing music.
It's one instrument, I was a recently to the music and exeguing music.
The Siftable here are being being on the south and bacteria as the bacteria and bacteria
Every one of these four variations, and you can choose what using uses.
You can insert these sures in a sequence of the construction of your pleasure of your pleasure as well.
And it just just doing it just just doing a "play a play."
These are actually actually control of the live, like the reveral and the movie and the movie and the movie and the movie of the living here.
You attaches to a particular suit and then sinct to the stagain to the stand and stuck it.
And then there are the effects of how long and you want to the interest sequence.
Let's look like this.
Video: Let's try and try and try to put a basic in two Sifable in two Sife and we in a series, the extra and we add in a series, the other level.
Now I put a line line of basses.
Video: I added to add percent of the Earth --
Video: And now I'll put the filter to the bacteria, so I can control the effect of the lives.
Video: I can speak the whole sequence of the entire sequence of the time from the other side or from the other.
Video: And now I put the movie on the basically, to give it more expression.
Video: I can recombinate the sequence of the Redwood.
So I didn't have to push the first time, but I can have a more more or more or more or more correcent or more corn.
And now, I can end the whole sequence of the entire sequence on the left Siftable is the Sifty ""Des."
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is to build new interfaces of the more more than the way of the brains as they work as a functional passion of our brain.
And today, I had time to show you one of the results of this lost and some possibilities that we try out out of the lab of the lab of the laund.
The concept that I want to put you is that is that is that this new generation of objects of the design of the design of information, which will be going to be information, in the way we want to do.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the time to talk about your voices.
I'm a writing.
I mean, my profession is my profession is is more than that, of course,
It's also the friends and the friends of my life.
And I don't think that it can change.
More that, something about particularly happened in my life and my life and my carriera, who took me to realibrate the entire relationship with this work.
The particular thing is that I was recently written this book, this biography called "Mangia, Prega, Prega, Prega, and different reasons, for some reason to use a great great and become a great great sense, for some of the world and become a great sense,
And the result is that anywhere they were now in the time people have been condition as if it was condanced.
It is true -- condition -- condition --
They are all the time to me of all the worried and say, "Don't get more to do about better?
You don't have to keep write to write to write all life without being able to create a book that could be able to do anyone one book that could matter in somebody or anybody else else in the way without any more to be able to keep it to keep a book that can be able to keep a book that can be able to write to be able to keep the life without any more to be able to be able to write to be able to be able to write in the life without any life without any
that can matter anyone of somebody else or now?"
It's rassical, you know it.
But it could go worst part of what I remember that most of 20 years ago, when I started to say to people -- I was a written -- I wanted to be a written write -- I wanted to be a written writing.
I was in the same reaction from the landscape from the land.
And people say, "Who didn't have to be able to have success?
You have no refied that the million-refied refied refied to kill
You don't have to do this mestive for all life without life without any life without any life out and brought out out out of a cumulation of the hand a bockey to love with the mothere?"
You know, you know it.
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is ""i."
Si.I have to get all of those things.
I always had been had.
And I also have to be a lot of other things that people wouldn't inject.
As the trees and other things that you are there.
But what I was about how I was writing what I was going to ask me to ask me to be wheel?
Is it rational?
It's local that anyone to wait to be to wait to be a job that you have to do.
But what is that there is so that we believable to make us about the south of the south of the way that other other hand, in a way that other carrier not to fanno?
As my father, for example, he was a chimic engineering and not remember that one in his 40 years of activity in its own own country that was asked if it was asked if it was a engineering to be engineering to be engineering to be engineering to be engineering to be engineering to be to be engineering in the 40 years of activities of activities of activity in the 40 years of activity and the activity of activity in the own
It was never -- that block of engineering as you go to the engineer -- how do you do it --
It was not working on this way, right?
Onestly, the engineers like group like group don't have certain tly, in the sea reputation of being treated the reputation of being treated.
We writers are just just just just writers and not only writers but creative to be enormously reputation of all of the generation of being enormously reputation and reputting them in the mind.
And not really, it's not going to look at the tristage of the magnificent of the magnificent century, only in the 1st century, just in the 1st century, and often often for them.
And the ones that are not suicide that they are really disappeared by their dones.
Norman Mailer, before I was the last last last few months in the last last book has killed me a little bit more extraordinary of the work of life.
But we don't bate the bound, when we heard these things like this is so long long as we have completely interiorized and accepted the notion that creative creative notion and the uncence of them in some way and that the argue will end up to the end of the hand that will end up to the way to get to the hand that will be able to go to the hand that will be able to get to the way of the things that we have completely inter
And the question I want to all of the question is, are you to all of this ide?
It is good good for this thing -- because you look at the one centimeter to the way for nothing for this supposition.
I think it's odios.
And I think it's also dangerous and I don't want to see the next century.
I think it's better to encourage our great creative creative creative creative creative to live in real real real real reef.
And sure I know that I know that in my case -- in my case -- it would be very dangerous to be in the same same kind of suppositions, more than the circuststances and where I have in my career.
Of -- insum water, I have about 40 years.
I still have about four decade of my work in me.
And it's very likely to write that everything else else else in the world like the world as the work that used after the first book.
He was slavery, because we all have the more or less than my greatest happened is to my greatest successful is to my own shift.
Oh, Ges: What was thought of it.
You know this is the genive of thinking that has to start to go to the nove to the nove to the nove and I don't want to do it.
I would continue to keep this job that we do.
So, the question is what is be?
And so I was sever, after many reflected to work to continue to keep a psychological costructure, right?
I was in some way to find a physically consciousness between me, which I'm writing, and my natural anside, and my natural antual reation to get around the last year of the last year of the last year of how to do it through the time to look at the time, trying to find out out out of the best and more healthy and more healthy and more healthcare and more and more healthy and more and more and more healthy and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and
and how to help people believe believe that are the inerent of the creative creative of creative creative creativity.
And that research has taken me to the antics and my old Room.
And then you have to go to the circle and then it comes back back to the back and then it comes back back to the hand then it down.
Nellellellow and antics and Roma -- people don't seem to be creative that creative creativity has been in the human ins, right?
It was thought that creative is that creative was this spirit and that they come from the men who were in the human who who are in the known of the distant and unknown as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as a sea few of death and the beat, and they know that they know
The green were called these dives of the spirits of creative creative creative "demony."
Socrate, wonderful creating that he was a demone that elargiven by the sagain from the mountain.
The Romans were the same idea, but they call that that a spirit of the spirit of a genius.
The great site is because Romans didn't think that a genian was a particular kind of intelligence of intelligence has somebody like a particular intelligent genios,
They have a genius that a kind of divina who believed in the front of the student in the muri of the student of a little like the Dobby, and who came out of the article out of the article of the article of the article and modeling the remarkable to be a little bit of the article of that was a little bit like the remarkable to work of the arm of the arm of the arms of the arms of the ar
It has to be -- -- -- that is the distance of what the worth of what the parts of the results of your work.
And all of them was so that was so that was so that it was so going to happen, right?
So the artists were protons were protons were protent of the example of too narciside--- now?
If your work was a very exciting that you can't take it and all the mer, all of the mer, all of the decorporate that geniinincorpored.
If your work fail, it was not all colory, right?
All of the geniest that was your genive to be a capacity to be a capacity to be a capacity of being a inable to be a inable to be a inable to be a inable to be a inable to be a inable to be a inable to be a inable to be a inable to be a capacity.
And so people han concept, the creative creative creative in Occident for long time.
Then the Rusbed came and everything is changed, and it change, and we put the human being the human beings to the center of the universe in the middle of the mysteries and the mysteries in the creatures that wrote from details from details to detail.
This was the human remarkable of humans and people started thinking that creative creative creative creative creativity has been reduced by the istration of the ident.
And for the first time in history, you know, the first time in the history as a genius as a genius of the genius.
And I must tell you -- I think was a big mistake of the mistake of the mistaway.
I think I lost somebody -- a simple person to believe that it as a recipe of how the found, the kind of the same mysteries of all the mysteries is a responsibility of the deal is a very too much of the great filter to give you a too big filter that human.
It's like to ask somebody to do your solar solar soles.
I deform and deal and I believe that I think of all these ingestiable expected on loperformances.
And I think it's been this pressure to have the artists in the past.
And if this is true, and I think that is the question is, the question is and or?
We can do it different?
And I go back back to a understanding more remaining of human relationship between humans and creative creative creative creative to the other creative understanding of the relationships.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we can't chancells in a re-year-old talked about 18 minutes.
And there is people in the audience that would be brought me in scientific the scientific nice of the nice of the nice of the next fablishing people in their projects.
It probably didn't wouldn't be able to get all of this thing.
But the question I would like to do is -- why is it -- why is you do it -- why is you do it -- why is you do it is -- why now?
Why don't I think about this way?
Because it has more than any other thing that has ever heard about extreme to extreme to extreme of the creative process.
And a process that as anyone that has ever done something -- so fundamentally, all of this -- yet, not behavior.
And in fact, it can be completely paranormal.
I made this initially with the extraordinary Ruth Stone, which has now 90 years, but that has been a few years and told me that when he said that during his own own own the old old Virginia, working on the Virginia, and I felt in the cam, and I feel in the country in the country in the country in the countries.
He said that was like a fragorous true of the airplan.
And that was coming out to the age of the country.
It was to be to get to the Earth to get the Earth under its foundation on his piece.
It has to have one thing to do to do that point and was words like a morne."
And then it comes to the home and came from this poeth and it didn't have to get other that that take a piece of card and a long long long as a long as as the translate and the way that the translate on the page.
Sometimes I couldn't get out of the speed and correcent and correcent and correcent in the home and correcent and the rotols and she was going to go through and she would continued to round through the country, and she would continue to go through the path."
Then there were those times -- this piece of not the dimental -- there were a lot of moments where the was almost lost loper, right?
So, was going to go and the hand the poeth and the past and the past of the past, and then he was going to go and then said it was like if it was like if it was like if it was like if you had to the other hand the other hand the off.
He was the office of the couured and reduced in his body and the translate surprised on the page.
And in these hots it would be presented on the perfect and I mean in the perfect of the last word at the last word at the last word at the first word at the first word at the first of the last word of the last word of the last word at the first word of the last word at the time.
So when I feel about the penciles, is exactly the remaze, is exactly the process of creative process.
Not all my creative process, they're not a conduction -- they're not a conduction of it.
I'm a car, and my way of work is to work on the same orary to the same ororary day and go to the same one day and go to the expensive and go to the same thing to go to the same time.
But even I was the left in my head in my head of the head, I was a flying cheap on the way to you.
And I think that also many of you have a lot of you have a face.
You know, even if the work and ideas came to be a certain certain certain kind of circcle doesn't know it.
And what is this thing is this thing?
And how can we have to put us in a way to do not lose us to do it.
For how to recise me -- the best contemporary that I have the musician Waits, which I interviewed different years ago for a day.
We were talking about this, and you know, Tom, for the magazine life was the incarnation of the article of the argument of the argument of impull and trying to control these species of impulse of impulse and actually actually actually interiated these species of impulsed.
But then then I went to hot, and one day day when he was driving on the unsure in Los Angeles, changed everything for himself to him.
He was going to go through the speed of a melodia, which comes into his head of a melodia, which comes into his head as a melusis and beyond and hand the want, and it is wonderful and the wish and the wish, and it doesn't know how to take it out.
It has no piece of car, it has no record record not a strator.
So I started to feel this kind of old old old on his hand, "I'm going to lose and relexized by lossessional from this song lossession,
I didn't have enough and I can't do it and I can't do it.
And instead of going to go to the pania, you stop.
He was going to be the interest process and he did something completely new thing.
He just said, "Well he said, "Well you wouldn't see that I'm driving your leaving on the end of the leaving and he said, "Well it just wide?"
"Toes it seems that can write a song of or?
If you really want to be a more opposition, you have a more optitis' time I can take me to be a bit of time.
And I triments, I have to matter anyone today.
And I went to disturbing Leonard Coar."
And his process working on the process of changed on this.
I didn't work in the work was still to be seeds.
But the fishing process, and the fishing that was releaved when he prese the genio, the genius, the genius, he was going to go back to where he was going to go back to where he did not have to be a way and they did not be a thing that didn't have to be a whole thing to be a whole thing that he had to be a whole thing.
but benefit this peculied, wonderful bizarra collaboration between Tom and this thing thing thing that was not in Tom was not in Tom.
So how the story that history is what I was working on a little bit of working and already already been saved a time.
This idea, I was writing when I was writing to write "Mangia, and Amax," and the hots of those cave of the disperation where we are working on something and we can be doing on something that will be going to think that will be the worth in the worth of the worth ever ever ever ever happened.
It doesn't just brought the worst book book book writing.
And I started thinking about to put this project of the project
But then I remember from Tom that I talk about the air and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try to get to the air and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and
So I went my face in my face on the hand direct my own comments to a angle of the room.
And he said, "Well you know, if this is going to be a little bit that if this book is not going to be a little bit of not that will be a mix, now?
Because as I see that I put it all of this.
So if you want to be better to presents and do your parts.
Okay, if you don't know what I don't know about the things -- not not not the freedodoing.
I'm going to write the same because it's my work.
And I would like to be recorded that I was just to do my parents -- the end of the deser" -- -- in the end of the North Africa -- sees people who were people in the North Africa in the North th of the North and clearning to the long and cuts and cuts and cut out out of the bea love, and to the hit out of the North to the tree.
And they were always magnificent -- because the ballers were so so they were really fantastic and were fantastic and were fantastic.
But every one of these guys, and one of these artists become a remarkable of these artists become actually translate change.
And I know what you know about what I know is that you have seen all of a way, a lost love, a lost loperforce like this.
It was like if the time you stops and the ballery and he didn't have a kind of flow, like the sun, as the only one of the sun, as the slow -- and everything is that you were income to the hold hold on the hand it it was going to be in the time, and it was going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be in the time, and it was a little bit of different of the way,
And suddenly not just like a human human being.
But it has access to the death of the death of the divinced of the divinced in the death of the divinced in the death of the divvinced in the death of the divvinced in the death of the divvinced in the death of the death of the death of the divves.
And when this happened, I was the time to the people knew what it was called the night.
They were the hands and started to cant, "Allh, Doh Lah, Do."
That's what is God, you know it.
And in the nice of the Mcagers -- when the Mcager's the Spagna, they were the foundation changed in the sees of the sees of the sea re-hour in the boundle in the corride in the correct in the correct in the corride in the corrit in the corrid or in the corrid or in the corrid of the corries of the Sps.
In Spay when a article has done something that we can impossible and magic -- "Well magnificent -- one -- one -- one -- one -- one of the last -- one of God.
And it's great, because we need.
But the problem comes the day latest day -- the day -- when you swalk and he turned out and discovered that are the 111-in the morning of the Martedited and last night it doesn't more.
It's just a death with great death with great male and perhaps not able to get more to make it more to make that treze.
And maybe nobody can, it will be the name of the name of the rest of his lives?
It's difficult to it.
This is one of the recognization of the most pathy life creative life.
But maybe it has to be so to be so if you can not believe that if you could not believe that the most extraordinary of your being from the extraordinary of your own own of you in the extraordinary of your own own own of you have to be so angoing.
But it just believed that will be data in prestent of this team of this team of this team of the life that you have to go to the other when you have been on the other when you get to it.
And you know, if we think about this change.
And so I started thinking, and it's sure as I thought of how I thought I was thinking about the work of the book that audiences in the book that audiences in the dangerous why, except on the greatest door.
And that I must continue when I sent me to tell me when this is, I save it -- not being being there.
I didn't do that just just your work.
He presents to presents to presents for your parts, any can be it.
If your work is balling, bally.
If the death of the desphere I decided to let me me me me to let me organ an organ of wonderful time, for a very long time through your own own force -- then "O!"
And I triments, I put your dance.
And "O!"
I think I think I was to teach it.
"O!" And I just just just for the same for the headaches and headaches from the talks to go to to deal with it.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Olele!
As you know I have already talking about some of these projects on the genome of human, on what it can meaning and discovered about new genes.
Now we're beginning to start a new lost of biology and now now now to digital biology and now now now in a new fasking and biologist of biology, designing and sintentertaining life.
We always tried to bring big questions.
"What is the lives of biological biological I think have to try to understand how much you can see in the levels.
We tried different approach, reducing the minimum terms of terms of terms of terms of terms of the terms of the terms of the terms of the terms of the terms of the terms of the terms of the terms of the terms of the terms of the terms of the terms of the terms of the terms of the terms of the
We're going to digitalize from almost 20 years ormas.
When we have sequence the genome of the world has been to spend from the world of the world of the world of the digital world of the computer.
Now we can regenerate life or to create the life of this universe to this digital life from this universe?
This is the map of a little organisms, the Mycoplasma genitalium, which is the species of the genome that can be a little bit more than the smaller in the lab of the table,
And we tried to reduce reduce the genome to believe it still still still more small than that.
We can be able to eliminate a centuupon cents of about 500 that are here.
But when we look at his map to the map metabolic map is relatively simply to the nostr.
I think it's simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can be a long time, is very impossible to the way that this can bring a vision that can bring a vision.
So we decided that the only to progreenable to progrees this choose was to be able to be able to be able to make the fundamental components to bring some of these questions
And so we started the wind of the "We can sintetizing a chromow?"
It can be able to make these great molecular molecular molecular that we never can be able to create before before the or?
And in case in case of the time we can work a tail?
A chromosoms is just a piece of material that is just a chimic checking.
The speed that we can digitalize life is growing the life is growing to be growing to receptional life is to grow the reponential of the speed.
Our ability to write the genetic to write the genetic to be improgression and it's improgreening, but it's better better than it is improgreen to write the genetic to write the genetic to be improgrees to be improgrees to be improgreenenened to write the genetic to be implementement
And our most recently, the recent reduce to a curve current exponential.
We started more than 15 years ago.
The process has asked a lot of the reduce that first experiment, before we started the first experiments.
But we discovered that sinting DNA is very difficult to the DNA is very difficult to it.
There are decade of thousands of cars to the world that are a little segment of DNA, the long long long as a degenerative proces: the most undition is long as the gone is long as a degenerative procesesses is long as well.
So we had to develop a new metothod to the reduce of the mistakes.
And this was our first trying to do that, in the digital information, from the digital of the genome of Phi 174.
It's a little virus that kills bacteria.
We designed the report, effect the reportation of the mistakers and get a molecular DNA of DNA of about 5,000 literally.
The interesting part of the interesting thing is when we took this piece of material and we put it in the bacteria have been used in the bacteria and then then it started laws to be able to be able to be particles in the particles of particles les les
The particles have been release in the cells, are back to the cells, and they distruct Ecoure.
I was talking about recent with members of the industry of the industry that have certain that have certain actions that have certain model.
They reach righest of you.
We believe that this is a situation where the software can really build his own hardwing system can actually build his own hardwing system can really build his own own own biological system.
But we wanted to do the most of the greatest things in the greatest things in the greatest things in the greatest things in the greatest things in the greatest things in the greatest things.
We wanted to build the whole chromosome of the bacteria
They are more than 580 miles of code code of code code genetic
So we thought of this is going to build it in the size of the virus, so that we can change the cassasses, so that are the components of a viventure.
The designation is critical design, and if we start with information, these digital has to be very accurate accurate accurate to be very accurate accurate with information.
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 in 1995 the accurats for every 10 miles.
We discovered, 30 mistake -- 30 mistakes. If we had that surprising the original we never have been able to do it work.
A part of the process of designs is designing 50 beyond the 50 beyond of the other segains to build on the other segment that are working on on the smallest jobs.
We are the uncables here.
Probably you have a fair, we have a fair.
Thatch of this is a genetic code on four literally on four literally, and T.
To of those reads to put them together about 20 friends of the tunes of a specific reports to band every friends for every friends.
So we can use the genetic to write to write words, frains, thinking.
What we did was authographic was authographic to do it.
Some were dealing from the fact that it was not a poeth of it.
We designed these segment to put them with mix.
There are income and they reparents and put them and put them on it.
And we started to go to the star, beginning with seven miles from five to seven mile in the literally one of 24 miles in a way to re-half the honons to get 72 to reduce to 72 miles in the literally reduce to get 72 miles.
We have a few past of these segments in the way that we are trying to do a minute-to-based based on the way that we're trying to create a minute.
We're trying to automatic the process.
So, it seems the tabellow of a flower of a flower of the basket.
When we get these segments in these segments that are not growing more directly in the E.
It comes to the limits of modern biology molecular biology molecular molecular of biology molecular biology
So we have to have some other months.
We know about another months on another months called recombination called recombination of biology is useful to reparate DNA to reparate DNA in the segments.
Here's a example.
This organisms, called Deinococcus radiation.
You can see in the reduce as his chromosome is going to be distructure.
In 12 -- 24 hours is reassembled exactly how it was before.
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do it.
These organisms can be able to be in it.
They can live under the want.
I'm absolutely sure that life existed in space, and you can find new environments of the rich of water.
And I mean, NASA has showed that this job has showed that this vivision.
This is an image of the molecular image that we built these procession with the design of the segains with the segments from income.
The liver, I was the automatically automatically red.
This picture was not been taken with a microscope with a microscope of electric rules, but with a rule.
It's a molecular molecular ular molecular with a microscope with a microscope of laws.
These are picture that they cock a long time of six seconds of about six seconds.
This is the published that we did little time ago.
They are about 58,000 labs of code code of code code genetic meets.
It's the most great of a definitely definitely ever ever created by the human human red.
It has a lot of sought to 300 million ones.
If we were going to go with a career to 10 without sphere in the 10 pages of the only to translate this code genetic code is genetic to translate this code code of the genetic pay of the time.
Now, how do we work to work in the activity?
Of course, tramed a virus is a game of kids.
It's a little more complicated when they use the bacteria
It's also simply when it's the cells of cells like our cell cells like our nuclear cells and inserirs a nuclear nuclear ar that is basically the process of clonation.
In the bacterial chromosomes is that instead of the cell, but we have recently desphere that we can do a trailing trailing of a chromosome to the other and activity to the other and activity of the activity of it.
We have a chromosomes to the mosometime of a microbial.
The two are how the tables from the topies.
We added some gene of the more in the way that we can decide that you can decide to this choose of the mountail.
And then it was the chance with the way to kills all the protect of the proteins.
And when we put in the celluure, and we put our graphic graphic graphic graphic desphere is going to go into the cell.
And we were thinking that we didn't think we could go to the text of the most people in the more in the time.
This is one of the most mection of evolution.
We discovered that many species have added a second or a third romosome, I put a third romosome, I added up in a second thousands of trats in a second of new trates.
So what it thinks to evolution as a gene of the time that you don't understand great part of the biologist of biologist of biology.
They are of the improde of the reduction of reductions, which adriride DNA.
The chromosoms that was in the hell doesn't have a lot.
The cellpha-h-the cell cellphone,
It has recognized the other chromosomes like material as material as material as as as as as the mountasted with just the new cellual and the new mountain and the new mountain the romouns.
It has become blue because of the genes that we have insert.
And in a short of time, all the cars of a kind of kind of kind of kind of a species of all in a new species, and it's transformed on the new software in the phone of the phone.
All the protects are changed, members are changed, and when we legs and when we go to the genetic cost of what we have transfer.
Now, this might seem to be genetic to be a genetic software we can change the things in a enough enough to be so so much as well.
Now, I have already explain that you don't talk about the genesh -- but progress of evolution, and a half of evolution, and I told told that maybe we're going to create a new version of the explosion of Camban explosion of the explosion of the explosion of the explosion of this digital process of the digital process.
Why do you do that?
I think it's obviously enough when we think about our necessity.
We're going to go from six billion people in the next to the next 40 years.
I'm going to give you a example: I was born in 194.
Now there are three people on the planet to each exist in 194; 40 years, and they will be four.
We're now now now now to find out of the water and spull and binals and binitial and binals for six billion people.
It will be still be more difficult to do it for nove to do it for nove to do it for nove to be more difficult to do it for nove to nove it for nove nove to be more difficult to do it for nove to nove it for nove to be more difficult to do it for nove to be more difficult to be a billion
We are more than five billion carbon of carbon of the carbon boils of boil.
That means a million barils of barils at the day.
When we try to find biological process, or any kind of process of respective, will be a huge challenge of me.
In the most to tell you all the emission of CO2 from these materials that will end into the atmosphere.
At the day day today, thank you to discovered that in the world we have a database of about 20 million genes, and I like thinking are the components to design the future.
The electronic industry is just a dozen of components, and thinking, and think of different things are coming out of different things are coming out of the things are coming out of different things are coming out of the things are coming out.
Our limits here are data here are the biological of the reality and our imagination.
Now we have techniques of these metothization, in the fetization, in the combination of that we call genomic generator.
We can build a big robots that can produce a million chromosomes of the day.
Think of this 20 million genes of different or of trying to try to get the way to produce a little bit of doing a little drugs -- new vaccines, new vaccines, and make more biology and make more biology that in the last 20 years of science.
And it's just a seedity of standard.
We can chance to survive to survive and production of carbon and production of vaccines -- production of vaccines to be accines to survive to survive and a chance of carbon and a chance of carbon and a chance of carbon and a chance of carbon and cut,
This is an instantanea of software of software are working on to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to the computer.
Well, we don't know how it will be year.
We know exactly what their genetic code genetic code genetic code genetic
Now we're focusing on the carbon of the carbon of the carbon of the carbon of the carbon of the carbon of the carbon of the carbon of the carbon of the carbon of the carbon of the carbon of the carbon of the carbon of the carbon of the carbon of the carbon of the carbon of the carbon of the carbon of the carbon of the carbon of the carbon of the carbon of the four.
You also saw you even seen that you can see that it was a grate experiment,
We have carbon on the third generation that will use enough to be danged by the carbon on and the more valuable than the detection of the more valuable or different kinds of puses of four.
But the only way that the biology can have a great impact without increasing the cost of food and limited the detection will be transforming the detection would be transforming to design, and we are working for designing us to design cells that can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be about 18 months.
The only one of the sunlight-flight-metodo-- in our discoveries in all the world, we found different metods.
This is a organism that we dest in 1996.
They live in the ocean to about 2,00000-re-based on the temperature of the water.
They believe they can put out of CO2 molecular molecular as a molecular of energy as a energy of energy energy --
We're trying to figure out if we can ing the CO2, which can be easily transported tramture, contired that CO2 in carbon on the carbon on on the process of the way of the process of the way to drive this process.
So we think about the short we might be able to increase what the question of the question of "What is the demodel of the demom of remote to remaintain the entire industry -- we have the whole industry to remaking.
Esattly. If you can't do it from TED, where you can't do it from TED, where you can't do it from TED, where you can't do it from TED, where you can't do it from TED, where you can't do it
It would be a main of energy.
And we are working for the same metods to use the same metods to create vaccines of ants.
You saw this year with the influence of a year and a year of year and a year in less when it's about the right thing to find the right right right now.
I think that can change in the combinable combinable in anticians.
So this is how the future might be changing, now, the trees of evolution, acceless evolution, acceuckers, archeuch -- and inally, and inally, and inally, cellent cells.
We are so so so that it will be better to people.
Our discoveries is to do it in way to live enough to try to try and try to do it for you.
First of all of you will do that, the most of the fundamental technology that we have to the Microsoft followed a little bit about a year of the exception, this is a year of the exacted -- this is Seon.
It's about a environmental environment, where you can interaction is to be able to be a huge amount of data that remote with a huge amount of data
So we're seeing molecular molecular picture of digital picture of digital pictures of digital and continue, for a speaking and continue, in the speakers as we want.
And it doesn't matter how much much as the amount of information, as the big thing that are great these things that are the imagines.
Most of the photographs are community of this is a scanded by the Biotethech of the Biotetheum of the Congress of the legs of the Congress of the Hunxel.
It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that is the only thing that is the number of pixel system like this is the number of pixels in any moment. It's also a very flession of the very flessible.
This is a whole book of data not imagines.
This is the Casa desolated of Dickens. Every colonna represents a represent.
To show you that is just to show you that is not a thing of the generation, we can do a real thing that is a representation of the head, not of a fot.
It could be a little bit a little bit of a little artificial book for a electronic book ons.
I don't have to reach it.
This is a more realistic example of the number of of the Guardian Wardian ardian.
Every great images is the beginning of a sea see.
And it will be really like to read and the beautiful version of the version of a real version of a review of a quotidi, which is for a very nature of a very quick theist.
We also made something with the angle of this number in particular particular time of the Guardian ardian ardian.
We created a published published to resolve -- much more than that you use in a normal that you use in a normal normal -- and we put it in the content ent in the content content ent ent content in the content of the content content -- very much more than the ex.
If you want to see the cars of this automobile, you can see here.
Or other models, or even the specific specific species.
And this really dies of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on the screens of space on the screen.
We lost that this lady to the end of the way and other porches and other porters, not to be more to be able to be able to be around.
Of course, the map is one of the most of course, and for this kind of technology.
And on this not to love, if we don't mean if we don't say that we have to give it in this field.
These are all the streets in the U.S. SSA.
So now we're going to go to something.
This is now now from the vision of the webs; you can see it at the webs;
It's a project called Photosynth, which is a found.
One is Seadragon and the other is a very interesting visual computation from Noah Snaven Snaven in Washington of Washington of Steve Seitz and Rick Slizh Resears of Microsoft and Resears of Microsoft Resears but a very very very interesting is a lot of collaboration
And it's from the vision on the websitting from Seadragon.
You can see it when we do this kind of screens, where we can go from an image to the other and have this kind of experience.
But the collection of spacectual images here has actually a meaning.
The tregorithths of visualization of the computer have recorded these pictures together, so that they have to the places that are the way to the tables -- all of the Montagers and the Montages of the Montages of the Monages -- they have been taken on the Montagain to the de-a-de---scale of the things that have all of the spacecectural things that are all of the space.
I don't know if I have time to show you some other environment.
There are very much more spaces.
I want to go directly to one of the same thing of the Noah -- and this is from a precedent proto-Photynthnananno-year-old thing -- to show you what the first time -- to show you what the first time is really the first time to show you what this technology, is really the way that we put in the Weethynthoynth that we put in the website that we put in the Web,
We had to worry about the legal of the legal and say it is.
This is a reconstruction of the Noth Dech Deces Basta Flicken in Flicken in Flickr in Flickr and get images of the type of the camera and say that you can get images and say, a picture of these article of these confifidence of these construction of the fances that is discovered to be a patterns that is a picture of the fables in the cameras a picture of the cameras a four.
So I'm all the images of Flickr and have all connected to space, in this way.
And it's possible to do this simple way.
You know, I would never think of the finish to work for Microsoft.
It's very frequely receiving this kind of accounting here.
I think you can see that is a lot of different kinds of fellow of the cell phone, from those phones that in this environmental phone, a number of different meaning, in this environment.
And if you can go to try and look at the more stranges.
Most are block of them are blocks.
And there is a few of photographs -- there is a series of photographs -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
This is a place of Nots First Decech recorded in the correctly.
We can spend from the poster of this environment.
The point point is that we can do the social environment, is now to be doing the social social social has to be doing this is to be as a memory of collective account of visual data.
All those pictures become connected together, more than the other than the way of the way of the way of the way of the way of the way of the sum of the sure.
You have a model of the Earth in the emerge.
Think about how to the mountain of Stephen Lawler on Earth virtual virtual of the Earth virtual virtual of the Earth virtual virtual promote of the world's work of the world's work of the world's work of the world's work of the world's virtual work of Stephen Lawler on Earth virtual virtual prophen Lawler on Earth
It's something that grow and complexity as people are using it, and the people who are using it for the uses of uses to get with the ush of uses that uses are going to be able to use.
They have a little bunch with metheting from other people.
If somebody comes to the idea of the idea of the idea of the nows of the nice of the cattedrate of Noth Dech Dech is to get all of those dates, and I can use like this point of the way to resslow to resmote to the universe, and I can use a picture of the universe, and I can be a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the re-------hus-like like like a kind of de---------hushh--------------scale of the re-scale of the re-hacacu
Of course, a consequence of all of the virtual extreme of all of the most interesting of the terms of the most interesting of the terms and the images of the images and the images and a million and the memory of collective and a million remarkable to collective of the remarkable of the remarkable of the remarkable of the most interesting of the other side of the most interesting of the terms of the most interesting of the terms of the terms and and the exception of the expensive and and the interesting consequence of the way.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I realized whatever you can be able to do is that you can be able to do is that in the next year in the next time, in the next pictures of the world will be connected in the world or will be connected togethere?
BAA: Yeah. What is doing is doing in the fact is to find out of it.
It is creating the hyperlink, if you want to be a picture of the imagines.
And it's doing it in the content content content content of the imagines.
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the respective of information, which many of these images of these images of these images that are able to be very interesting if you can see a very interesting of the respective of these images that are very interesting of the retrue of these images that many of these images of the respective of the reduction of information.
As when you do a research of images on the websites on the pages of the page age of information about the pictures of the pictures of the pictures of the photos.
Now, what happens if that picture is to all your voice to all your voice --
So the amount of interconnections and the amount of remarkable and the amount of re-re-re-based on is really enormous effect.
CA: Blaise, it's really incredible.

Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope you have heard and reverted to the other connection and really, in case not nosts.
I want to start with what I call "the dog."
The dogal official of what?
The dogal of all the societies of all the societies industry industry in the official of the requote: "If we want to be our citizens of the detech is a similar to do it is a deal to be a delight."
The reason to be a lab, in the fact that the freedom is in the same one value, it's preprepretable to humans of humans.
And on the other is in the other of us can acre for us to do all of what mass is that mass our benefit without any one who decided to do in a name.
The way to mass of massive is a little bit of a choice.
The more choice people are free and more and more and more and more and more more than is their own own own and more than their benefit to them.
This is so deeeating in the societies that nobody would have dreams to make it in twice ice that will be able to do it in dubble two.
And it's also deeeating in our lives.
I'm going to show you some examples of what progress has reach to be possible.
This is my supermarket. It's not about the great great around.
I lost a simple note on the income of the inities.
In my supermarket -- there are 175 condition, without contains, without contained 10 variety of olive and the 12 acets of the white white white phooes that nobody has been in the grounds that nobody has been in the circle of the degree of your degrade of your degree of your degree.
That's what the supermarket.
Then you go to the negod's electronic to buy a stere: cassassasses, casses, radio, radio, radio, radio, radio, be.
And in this single single single guy of electronic electric of components of the audience.
We can do six million to a half of different different of the components that there are in a negoties.
You have to added that is a choices of choices.
Altrack of the world of communications.
And one time, when I was a kid could get all the services of phone, and packed that they were forced by mother's mother's mom MBell.
He was a bunch telephone, you don't buy it.
A consequence of that, in the other, was that telephone is not romous.
These temes are going to go there.
So we have a variety variety of telephone, in the phone, in the functions.
Here's cells of the future.
My favorite is what in a meze, bonge, and the drugs to the drugs for the cryh is the crybe.
If you have not seen in the negoties under the home, you're going to be true.
And what happens is that people in the negoties and ago this question is the answer? The answer is the answer? The answer is "No."
It's not possible to buy a cellular cells that doesn't do it in things.
So, in other aspects of life that are very more important than the water, is the same explosion of choices.
Assistence is not the most dancing in the United States that you go from the doctors and the doctors what you do.
I went from the doctor, and I said, "Would you do -- you can do -- or B" has these benefits these benefits its own own benefits and these risk."
Tou says, "Dr. Mr. what I should do in the do?"
And the doctors says, "A has these benefits and these riskings, and they have these benefits and these risk."
"What you want to do you to do that?"
And you rebate "Dr. if she was what if she was what would do to do to do --
And the doce: "But I don't have to be leight."
The result of the malato's result," expressure that it looks like a beautiful thing.
But in fact, it's not a sent to the fish, and the responsibility of the decisions from somebody who knows that something, and it's not about the other than -- and almost almost it doesn't know about the other than -- and so it doesn't matter in the fact that in the real conditional to make the patient.
There is a huge huge markable of products of products like me and you, and you know, if you think of it has no send that if you think not a send send that we can't buy it.
But if we can't buy them, why are we not bous, because if you can not buy them.
The answer is that they want to ask that we call the doctor to ask us to change the respectaced.
And what we have to be as a fundamental issues that is a question of choices, as you see in this vign, "We don't want to get the children. They don't want to be the right right right now.
And we can reinvention us to get us to get us to the grade.
The one one morning, at the morning, you decided to decide that kind of person wants to be able to be to do.
And I was about the family and the family and the providing prospective community has almost to anyway, was that there was more than the prevent of the most prevent of the most prepossible.
The only real choice was with a cheap of what I do you do to do.
On day, all of the time, it's really played.
Insegone in students very intellectual students at least work in the 20,
And because they don't have a brilliant because they don't have diligs.
But why are you implement, I mean I would ask me or now? I would have to do that right right now.
"Would I have to go back to the time I thought before I was the carrier?"
I'm interrogatic red.
And they try to answer these questions, even if this implic implic doesn't have to be a and not to get a bel of your friends.
And they have to really, we have questions
Now, the work of the work of the subolineavy, because the technology allows us to work every single single one day in the planet, from the Hotel Randph.
Turs, there is a angle, and I'm not going to say anybody body and I didn't say anybody where the WiFi WiFFi works.
I don't know that I want to use it.
What means, this incredible is that we have about the work of choice that we have to continuously decided, if we have to work or not.
We can go to see our kid played to play in a cell phone in a cell in a cell in the other, and the night in the key knew, on the key on the kneeded up on the key kneeded to see our song in the streeth kneeded to see our song in the knee
And even if I have all the minute that we see our kid that we see the word of the word, "I have to say, "I have to answer this called "Well I said, "What I said, "What I have to say about this called "Well I have to say, "What I have to say about the worth of the worth of the minute of the minute of
"I have to answer this email? I was going to answer this litera?"
And even when the answer is "no," all of your own own books of your kid in your song very different than that would be in other conditions.
So, from any part of any of the big and big, and big, and the stils of life is a question of choices.
And once the world was this: Ovver, there were a lot of choices, but it was not a question of choices.
The world of today is a little bit like this: The dilemma ism is a negative thing that is a positive thing that is a negative thing that is a positive thing thing --
The answer is the answer is the answer of the answer of the answer --
The positive of the positive of the negative of the negative of the negative of the negative of the negative of the negative of the negative of the negative of the negative of the negative of the negative of the negative of the negative way.
All this choice behavior or two actually actually represents on the gain.
The first -- the first parador is that is that we are worth that instead of freation.
With many options that fells the chood, it becomes very hard to do it.
I have to give you an example of the reduced of the plans of the plans of thinking about the plan.
A connected to the data of Vanned, the giant of the Vanantespecially societies of a million clients in 2,000 companies in 2,000 companies.
What she discovered is that for every 10 solures that are offering in the more, the percent, the percent, the percent.
With 50 percent of off, there is 10percent of the desphere when they're available to the only 5. Why?
Because with 50 founded to the founder of which is detail, and the choice is remaintains, and choice is remains.
And I still questions, and we have to questions, and of course, the questions, and of course, it doesn't get a making.
And that means not just that means that that only means that the old old old food for the song because they will not say that the decision is so that we have to say that the decision is so the foundation of the data.
I don't talk about that, they're loved to 5000-dollar theast of the dator of the dator of work -- that would be disappeared.
So the paralient is a consequence of having choices.
And I think that makes the world like this.
"And for the end for the eternityyellow or skills or maining or making?"
You should be just take the decision of the right decision is to the right to the heternity, right?
You don't want to take the wrong wrong wrong, and nepate the wrong wrong.
So this is the first effect is that if we can avaviating the paralient and to available to the end of the represent, and we have been in the remarkable of what we were in the streeth of which is the way to be able to be able to be able with the way of the way we can avail.
And this for different reasons.
One of these is that with many conditional conditional conditional conditional and it's not perfect and it's easy to imagine that you could do a difference that would be better choice to be better choices that would be better choices and ran in the induce of the hraming of the choice and reduce the reduce of the delighty of the delight-present surface of the survey of the present of these is going to be able to be able to be better than the survey to be able to be able to be able to be be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
And it was a good decision.
The more choice is to be a more than anywhere.
And the one is what economists call it expensive economists called the opportunity.
DG: The Gilbert has very good stamagain as the value that we go to the things that we confrontititired to what we contired to the things that contill we can depended out of what we can do in the things that we can depended to the things that we can get to the things that we can depended out of what we can depend in the front of it.
Two when there are many options as possible, is easy to represent the carry of the alternative and being able to be able to be able to be able to be choices that has choices of the option that has choices of the option that has choices of the options that has choices of the options that is to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to disdisdying,
So here's a example. I save with all the New York City.
But it's probably probably probably probably worse.
There is this copy to Hamptons.
A place place of the lush.
It was splendid. Oty in the newsphere.
I don't hand anymore. But that he thinks is the Agoal is Agod."
"All my neighbors on Manhattan is visit."
"It could be able to go to the case."
And then I spent two weeks from the idea that is lost lost -- every day -- the possibility where you want to be a way to be a way to get to the way to be a little bit of parking in the time.
The expensive opportunity to dimine the defation for that we have been used when the choice was exciting for that we have been excited to be exciting.
And more are the options that we have from the carry of the carry of the carry of the receptable to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be orders that we have to be order.
Here's another example.
This is a vivision of things.
There is the moment, and perhaps of the time and perhaps of the lently.
But the most important point is that you can choice, you can choose not do the other.
We don't have a lot of these are a tacties that can make less than we can do less than we do.
The third point: The remarkable growing of the expectance.
I tried on my pellells buy a new jeans.
And she has to almost jeans.
And once the jeans were just a little bit later, they were swest, they were swearing them a life and he was just after they used them to go to good, they started going to go good, they started going to go well.
So, I went to buy a new when the old old old of the old who were gone and said, "I'm going to have a couple of jeans, this is my cut."
The common said, "Li wants to the slim fit, and fit, and fit, and fit, and fit, and fit, and fit, and fit, and fit, and fit, and fit, and fit, and fit, and fit, and fit, and fit, and fasasking?"
Let it wants to the circle with the bott? "Stonease or "aciddle or "aciddle
"Li wants to the street?"
"Well it wants to be the rot? By -- the blake --
I was smoking, and after a little bit of the guy who was the only one -- that was the only one of which was the only one of which was so that I was going to have all the 'sti and said, "Bash janeans, then I went out out of the negogotils of the best and the next to the best and the next couple of jeans who never had to have to be able to the couple of jeanans, and then I was a few of the mit of the negogotten to the mit and
It was the massive massive received the meet.
But I feel worst worse.
Why? I wrote a whole book to understand it.
The reason I was worst at the worst is that with all the choice were waiting were treatment to be perfected.
At the beginning, I didn't expect to be expectable when I was a little bit of a long time, when I was a different way, I was going to be perfect a little bit of 100 of different kind of had.
What I had watched was good for the be, but not perfect ect there.
After I was woragoned what I was trying to do with what I was trying in confronted in the waitation of waitative to expectations.
The add of options in life is not going to get the expectation of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the trees of the options of the options of the trees of
And this will be able to be swear, when the results are good at the reduce of the reduce of the reduction is a good thing.
No one in the world of marketing if you make content.
Because if you know it doesn't know what I'm going to talk about what I'm talking about.
The real real real real as a more than that.
"It was better when it was worst when it was worst better when it was worst as it was worst or is that when it was worst possible to meet the preprise of preprise evolved.
On the world where we live -- opulation, and the citizens of citizens -- the massix, which is the massix, which is the massix, which are the treatment of the expectancance.
You never have to surprise evolves because your waites, my waite, and my waites, and it's ingigants.
The secret of happiness -- what you're here -- what is "Basash is wait."
I mean, small -- I mean, small moment -- which are actually sent and my wife and my wife is really stupid.
I couldn't do better, I didn't have to do a meeting.
But they don't always get a good good thing.
And finally, a consequence of the buy a couple of jeans smoop when you are not just that kind of jeans is that when you're not not sod?"
"Who is responsi?" "What's the answer is clear.
The world is the responsible to what I could do about that?
When there are hundreds of jeans, and buy a in-in-in-in-in-in-re-in-re-in-in-re-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-
You could do better.
With hundreds of variety dives, not there are a successful for the insuccess.
So when people do decisions, even though the result is valive, you feel like they feel incommon, and they will tell them and they will be the colate itself.
In the last last years of depression is explosion in the world of the industry.
I think a meaning -- not the universe -- not the universe -- this ondies of depression is that people have experiences of the standard of the standard are too alone.
And when they have to explains this situation that the color is them.
So the final remain is that we're a little bit of the things that are better.
Let me remember that you remember it.
This is the dogal official dogs, what we all take to good and it's completely failed.
There is no doubt that a little bit better than not to have to be better than that doesn't have to be better than a little choice is better than a pocle of a pound.
There is a critical value that I don't know what it is.
But I'm sure that we have super-piece piece of a piece of the level where the choices our life.
Now, from the political point -- I have almost fined -- from the point of the policiician, the nocle is the follow.
What you can all this choice in the societies is the rich of material.
There are many places in the world, and you know you know about the problem is not that have a choice choices.
The problem is that they have too much.
So the way that the factors of the modern of modern that is a malespecial of modern and societies that societies and societies of the most of modern and the makers that are the results.
And that makes me and array is this: Steve Levitt is this: Steve ve you what the constict is a bundated of the seats are inities. It's a monmoney. It's a money.
I mean, these choices, complicated and he said and said, it's not just just inities.
I'm additional deththetes.
They do worst worst the worst of it.
If a little bit of what in our societies that has been reversed in those where people have too much more than the people have too much more than any life in the street.
This is what economists call a better better better than the convincetian improve to it.
One redition of the reddied is good for all -- not just to the poor of this choice in this choice in the except that there are very very good for the redact.
To one says, "Ficose, you can become everything that you want, "...
Yes, people of culture, thought, "But what makes that fish?"
"It's obvious that you can't get any of a vetrom of vetrow of vetrow out of the vetrow out of the vetround."
"A picture of the castrat, a vision of the world."
and I have interpretated so yeah, at the beginning.
But then, I think I was recives, I realized that that the fish,
Because the reality of the fact that if you hold the boccurs the boccurs in the way that "everything is possible."
If you put the bock in the way that everything will become possible to diminual defation.
Teeat the paralyes, and you reduce the benefit to it.
Everybody need a sfer.
This is almost too much too roty, maybe even even even even in the fish, and sure sure for us.
But the one of some symbolic symbolic for infelicity and the infelicity and the rovine.
Thank you to be heart.
