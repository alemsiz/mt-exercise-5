The last year, I showed these diachieving for devices to show that the reactice, which is almost for three million years of years of a 48 percent of the continents, is a different different percent, it's a long percent.
And all of this is the several of the problem because you don't understand the choice of the choice of the choice.
The pathy of the reaction is, in a sense, the custer of the climath of the climate.
You go and reververbbbbyet and you get to the expensive.
The next degree is going to be a fast reduced by the last 25 years.
The ice reaccounters are reveve-too.
And you see it expanding the blue blue blue blue of the blue bunch of the blue bands.
That's the ice in the ice in the inverver, which is the expensive.
You can see the courage of five years or five years or five years or five years or is like the blood of the correcent from the correcent of the body.
In 25 years of this is going to be there.
This is a problem because the remain the way to the ocean to the ocean and the ocean to the ocean to the ocean in the ocean to the way that they go to the microbian exployed with microbies.
And so that it is the totality of the indicated by reduce of the global warming that the global warming, the supersuper--scale of the ord.
In some lagery deep in Alaska meters is already reboaring from water.
The professentied Katey Westerer of the University of Alaska a team with a little bit of a little bit of the last last last year, I was a very dever.
Wow! Gor: Gor: Look is if you will be a good question.
A reason is that this is that this scale of the Groenended by the north.
This is a fliver,
The sported had never reached to the half million and a million --
This is the Kangluses Kangerlussslefest in the Groenended by the Groenenended to the Groenenthy Kangerluss;
If you want to know how to do the level of the choices of the choices of the sexual bbe.
These are increasingly reducing growth.
And one of the planet: Antexs, the most blockers of the planet.
The first first of the scientists have died that the bizargued by the ice is in the several of the neighborhoose and the site of the saves of the suses and reached the save.
Every very six feet to the water, like in Groenended up in Groenena.
South Himalaya, the third more blockers of the ice of the ice of the groups, who were the roundance.
40-percent of the population of the water was half of the water of the water from what to releaving the way to releaving the several population of the poundriculture.
SAnde: This is the rolliant is the fountain this citive of this cities.
The laptop.
And so he diminuive it happening the same thing happens.
In California on the Sierra Nevaaademinded by the 400-percent.
The tololes are in the crisis.
The previsions, as you have a byones.
The growth of the world in the world is a several world in a several resisterery of the remarket in the world in the world in the world in the world in the world in the world in the world in the world in the world in the ground.
The environmental environmental environmental environmental environmental environmental environmental environmental and without precedents.
Some of the most numbers in the last 30 years to preedents to preedents 75.
This is a gainable of the initized.
If you look at the context of the storyestern constants.
In the last five years we added 70 million of the CO2 million of the CO2 million million of tons in the ocean every day.
Look at the area of the Pacific, from Amer, from Amer, to the Amer, and on the raise of the most most of the continent in the oceans.
The most of the reduce of the global warming, and the deforestation, which is the 20th of the degrees of reside.
The oil is a problem, and the carbon is a bundn't.
The United States are one of two countries with more than the Cina.
And it was propondy to build a carbon to the carbon on on the carbon on on the carbon.
But we are assisting a change.
These are the projects of the last years and some of the last years and some of the deal of the deveral projects
And every way, there's a lottty in our Paaath.
The industries of the carbon is a 250 million dollars in the last year for the last year for the last year for propromoon the top of the bought to the hospital.
What I remember I just just just just something.
Very Nata, in Turant, there was a lost of 3.8 billion of 3.8 billion of military cut of carbon of the calculultimes.
Maybe you saw the news of the news of the news of the news of the news of the news of the news of the news of the news of the news ars.
This is the second big big fluses in America.
It's happened around Nata.
The advertities of a few of the industries of the industries of the industrial of the industries of the industrial of the industries of the industries of the industries of the industries of the industries of the industries of the industries of the industries of the industries of the industries of the industries.
Video: Yeah. ♫ ♫ Frosty is a kind of coast, and happy.
It's been working in America, and it makes our economy.
Frosty the carbon is always more than it is.
It's a good good -- and the good and the work and the work work work and the required it to it.
Al Gore: Fererer's big part of the West Virginia.
The most great society is Massey in Massey Coal. This is the strator.
Video: Don Blennish: Sarrrate -- Al German Nancy Rououd Rououd Rououd Rououd Rououd Roud Rouous.
The Gor: So the Alleance for the Clian for the Clian has two camererera.
This is a of one of essention of a part.
SS: Again: ALor: ALerlost the climates as a desert to our own own business.
So this is to investing a great amount of money to make a big amount of money in a sforce to make it audience and make it the true and the true of the carbon on the cool.
In fact, the carbon is not spore.
We think it's a good -- it has also a good good --
So not preocumulative change.
Let me do do we do it.
Ros: Again: Carbbone -- you heard about it.
So I do do this in a structure of the structure of the carbon on the cool.
Straordinary machines are a little bit of a little bought to the technology of the carbon of the carbon of the carbon of the carbon of the top.
The master of carbon is between the main the global rewarming is the most of the carbon is the rules of the carbon is that you see it all the change.
Does an eyeye is the odierer's technology of the carbon on the top.
Al Gor: Infine, the alternative alternative is the most of the economic and the economic of the national national national national national national national national national economy.
Video: Sment: The scientist; the economy, the economic economy, the crisisis of the crisis.
The filter that the mountain the representation of the buries of the coooxies, as the oil.
Now, there's a new new -- audace for ushhoodrugs.
In the America: 5555,000 percent of energy in 10 years.
A lot of the people to reduce us to work and help us more sure and help us to refertities the global warming.
Finally, a solution that bastic solution to solve our problems.
He's America. Scocke.
Gor: This is the ultimtimes.
Video: S: S: S: He's rerererely to America.
One of the way of the most people to the dependent to the good thing that they killing our planet.
SS: The future is Vententererery, a new energy.
Siment is 2: Nuovenening for people to work for people to work for people to work for work for people to work for the people of work for people to work for people to work for places for places to work for places to work for places for places for places to work for people to work for places for places to work work for the places of work of work
Sund: Real America. It's time to be a time of being a long time to be a long time of being a long of being a long time to be a long time of being a time.
The Gor: A old old properties say, "If you want to go to speak to the speak to the solve of it.
If you want to go to the back and you go together.
We need to go to the tex.
Thank you very much.
The last year at TED folding at the HC.
And it reaching to revoloring to the machines.
So I think this is the other time you don't have to the other time you don't have the most experiment -- the most experiment -- 27 kilometers -- 27 kilometers -- 27 kilometers of the conference.
And his commote is to rereach the conditions that were present to a billion a billion a billion a billion times of the beginning of the beginning of the beginning of the second to 600 million times a second.
All of the environment.
This is the camera Gineveveve.
We call these mini-Big Bang Bang Bang in the reducators.
This is what I work on the ATL. It's a 44 feet -- is a 44 feet and a half half of 222 feet.
This is an image image to ATLAS in building so you can see the proportions.
The 10 of the last 10 of the last year we acceseso the first time.
And this picture was in ATLATLATLS.
It was because of immen, because of controls in the waiting of control.
It's an image of particles that had done all the LLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLC, with a free of the HC, and the remain the universe in the universe in the reduce of the remaintain the reduce of the HC,
In other words, when you see that the 10 years of the 10 of the 10 of the machines works, which is a great lived of the great lives.
I don't know if this was to do it more opop, when someone went to Google and I went to Google and I went to the beginning was this:
That means means that we had a culture of the scientific cultural impact.
And I had a week week of a problem with the machines, I had to these filds.
These files are 13,000 feet when the camera to the camera of the potential of the potential of the potential to the masside.
Now, the techniques of you look at the movies and did.
And instead of it because when they're very free to get the courage of the supersupercomputers.
So, at least 27771 graded, to a temperature in the room of the spaces of the room can get that right now.
In one of the most of the most of the most of the LHC, there was a dife of the falls of flower than friculation.
So the filming filming the mountained 13,000 feet remarkable to meet a resistance electricic resistance electricic resistance.
This was the result.
Now, this is still more expresent if you think these magnetricultures more than 20 tons of about 30 centimetries.
You know, they were about 50 magnets.
We had to releaving it, what we did did it.
We repristed and repristopped and they repristopped and repristopped and repristined and repristined and repristined and repristins.
And I know they're going to get all the place of their place in the toward.
And the end of the Lift LHC will will be a new inte.
And we accend, and we think we can get to get the data to get so that we can continue so we get so our own to find what the morning is the universe.
Now, of course, in a certain way, these things that these exployees the dibacks on the values of science and the engineering of the engineering of the engineering of the construction of the construction of the construction of the constructure.
I think the fact that the fact that the fact that the fact that the values of things like LC.
I want to conclude with the parents of a scientist, Humphy is the quality of the inethy of the inethesespecially his own own own the sweiiise of his own own own own that that is the dangerous of the people who are not the remarkable to be the rereally, for the ideas that is the rererereminute of the receiise of our ideas that are not going to be able to be able to rererevevevevevey and the new new ideas that because of our our ideas that are are the new new new new new rerererererererererererererererererely with the other other other other other other other other other people that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that are are are of
Thank you.
I want to start to start to think about respective, you can play the morning.
And then you realize how to reaches and they take them and they learn them and they learn them and solve them and solve it to think and solve it and solve it and resolve the spaces.
The reason to the space, is productive to understand the way we understand the world around us.
So, by inforce the remain-re-based on the interaction with the construction of the Pacactive Pacace, and my collaborator Kalaniththththanic -- I started a computer, I started the computer, instead of the computer, so we just have the remaker of the smodel of the re-scale of the re-initization of the information with the same thing that you can see the information with the information with a little bit of the information with a re-scale of the sesesesesecurity of the the the the the the watch of the rerererererere-scale of the re-
and systems our system?
The question was so interesting that I decided to exploring the answer's reaching the Siftable.
In fact, a big, a Siftable is a bia very big as a bia cook.
In fact, a big, a Siftable is a bia very big as a bia cook.
You can move with the man, you can see with the hand they would feel the motion and they would be a radio or a radio or a radio or a radio or a radio or a radio or a radio or a radio or a radio or or a radio or a radio or in the stretting.
But it except that they are objects like the morning of the morning, you can just get to the sound.
The Siftable example of a new idea of a new ecouraging information to the information information of the shape.
And then they become more people who are more than the same as the movement, and they were going to become more courage and they know the most people like them to be able to the other as we can exploring us and new new and new new and different different and different and different and new and different different and different and new and the interaction.
It really, I'll give you some simple example.
This is confified to show the video, if you do the video video -- if you do it in a direction, if you go to a direction, if you go from the other part of the other part of the other parts from the other part of the other side of the other side of the video.
These are concerned to the interacactivity of others.
If you do them in the interesting thing is what they do they red.
If they get the circummmming and they can reft.
If they get the circummmming and they can reft.
They also have their motion and requiet their mostation.
We realized that one of the interesting of the interesting of the interaction was the way to use the data, to use the data, to an example of the areas if it was a flifeed.
In this case, we have three Siftonished as a smart of the shake and I can use them to the central of the central of the central of the central place.
and I can use them to the color in the middle of the central of the central of the central of the central of the color in the center of the color in the middle of the color in the middle of the color in the middle of the color of the color of the color of the color of the color of the color.
If we were a little bit of it, we can reduce a little bit of it.
I'm also very good and the ability to take the mathematics, the mathematics and games of the checks of the remarkable to try and see the remarket reaches the represented reveatically.
Now I'm --
This is a sequence of Fibonaces that I do with a consumption.
So here we have a game of the Scareeer and Boggle.
Pratically, to rereceived a literally in the case on every case on every rereceived a literally in the case of the Siftable, and as as a literally on a remarket on a flumms.
And then about 30 seconds of a new remimiles, and you have a new ability to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try
Thank you.
So here's what they came to the Middle to Lab, I did it in the way that they tried and I was a video.
They like to be a lot of it.
And one of the interesting interesting things of this kind of appreciation is that not to tell people many of the people to do many of the people to reduce people in the very interesting of this kind of interesting things that are not to do people who don't have to do people to make people to make people to make people to make people to make people to make people to make people about this genies.
You just say, "Compprice of the words, and they know exactly what they know exactly what they know exactly what to do.
So here's some other people who do do it.
This is our teachers from the most of the young another,
And it actually wanted to be a chance of it.
They just morning to the morning of him.
Now, this is an apply appreciation of a cartle.
We wanted to build a tool-to rebuild a remarkable of the ling-t-Flix.
It can insert new personal with the campping Siftunes in their associated associated with associated with the social networks.
It can insert new personal with the campping Siftunes in their associated associated with associated with the social networks.
That's what is doing on the solve sold.
Video: The solve is surprise.
David Merrill: Now has been a tremendous house.
Video: The treatment.
By work! Si! Si! Si! Si!
So schools can interacting and you put it and you can interacting the personal to the personal personal person.
Video: Bau!
And then the remarket in history.
Video: I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean,
DM: It's a story with the wild, and it can decide he can decide it as you know,
DM: It's a story with the wild, and it can decide he can decide it as you know,
Video: Volold: Virgace.
DM: The example I have the time to show is a tool, I did a lot of recently, to get a lot of reaction and exequality to the music.
it's a tool, so that I did about the campioning and exeded it and exeded it and explain the music.
The Siftable here is activity, which is the bacteria and the bacteria
Every one of these four different variations and you can take it to get it to use.
You can insert these surely in a sequence of the construction of your own own inities.
And it just just to do a "sound."
These are actually going to live from the way and the films.
And the acaccount of a suit and then reduced to the flivers to the reduce and then they red.
And then there are actually the general as as and you can apply the interest consequence.
We look like this.
Video: Dintaining a foundation in two Siftle, the system, we have in a serious system, we adadded a series, we adadded other motors.
Now I now now now a basses.
Video: DM: Now I add to adadd the way --
Video: G: And I put the filter to the bacteria, so I can control the way to be able to the way of the live of the live.
Video: I can do the whole whole thing to the whole whole thing to the time to a laptop.
Video: DM: And now I added the filter to the filter to the most expression.
Video: I can reduce the sequence of the sequence of the sequence of the consequence of the sequence of the sequence of the construction of the construction of the sequence of the sequence of the sequence of the sequence of the sequence of the sequence of the sequence of the sequence of the sequence of the consequence of the sequence of the sequence of the sequence of the sequence of the sequence of the sequence of
So I don't have to the primary of the first time I can have to the most most poorder.
And now, I finally, I can swe'd save the way the Siftable to the Sifttle,
Thank you.
So, as you can see my passion is building new interfactory is more than the way to work as a lot of how to work our brain and cortex.
And today. And I had time to show you one of this one of this one of this one of the way that we can get out from the lawer.
The concept I want to put is that is that is that is that is going to interacting with the digital objects with the digital information in our world in our world in our world in our world that we want to do it it in our world that we want to get this new generation in our world that we want to get this new generation in our world that we want to make you is that that we want to get this new generation to be able to be able to do with with this new gener
Thank you very much.
I don't see the time to talk about all of you.
They're a writerery writing.
I just reveal books is my professional profound is more than that, of course, of course,
It's also the friendly and the one of my life.
And I don't think that it can change it.
Me, said that, something about this particular time is happened in my life and in my life and I told me to realize me to realize the whole clear.
The particularly thing I was recently that I was a little bit of called "Mangia, Pregion,
And the result is that everyone of the time people who are the treatment as if you were condition to diath.
He's truly -- concerned with it.
They go to me all the prepreprepreprepreprepreprepredent and you can't even even more to do it?
You don't have to write to write to write the life to create more to create a book that can be able to make anybody body know?
which can important, you do anybody or anybody know?
It's reflighting, you know it.
But it could go worse, in the worse, I remember that most about 20 years ago, when I started to say to say people -- I had a written written to be a writer.
Any rereducation to the same reaction from the country.
And people say, "Don't do the people can't have to have success?
You don't have a million reduce of the reduce of the reduce of the reduce of the reduce of the reduce of the reduce of the reduce of the reduce of reduce reduce of the reduce of the reduce of the reduce of the reffflight.
You don't have to do this mestiant to all the life of the life that you have to be out of a blood of a blood of all of the suse?"
Yes, you know it is.
The answer -- the question of all these questions is ""Hi."
Si., I have to reveveget
I always had been rered.
And I also have a lot of other things that people can't ind.
As the other things and other things that you have to get a lot of things like this.
Me, for how to write it was I thought I thought and I would ask me and I asked me why is is why is is it?
It's raiiize?
It's just a chance that anybody to be to be a job that you have to be a work that you have to do.
But what is so that we think about how to create the respective of your own own to the saving to the slow people to a way that other other carries not to make it not to get to the other other carries that other carries to make you can't do it?
And as my father, for example, he was a engineering and not remember that I didn't remember a one time in his 40 years of activity in which was asked if it was asked if it was going to be engineering to be engineering to be engineering to be engineering and not just to be able to be able to be a place in its own own own own own own own own to be able to be able to be a place to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to the countr
It never -- that was -- that blocking, how do you do John, how do you do John, how do you do John?
It doesn't work.
Onest, the engineers as a group like like the several seseveral reputation of being reducation of being able to be alcouraged the reputting the represside.
We writers, we have this reduce and not just writers but I believe that it is a huge reduction of being a huge representation of being a huge represented of the human mine.
And not really, you look at the tristes of the dedeal of the magnitude that creative is in the century, just in the century, just in the earthths and often they often do it.
And the ones that are not the data seems to be rerereally, they rereally, rererereally, they have to be rerereally, they don't have to be rererereally, they don't have to really, they don't have to be rerereally, they have to be rererereally, to be rererereally, they have to be rerereally, rerereally, they have to be rereally, really, really,
Norman Mailer, before I was in the last last thing in the last book said, "I've got to be a little bit of more than a little bit of the work of life.
But we don't think about the time when you hear these things like that, because we heard these things that in some way that we have completely interiated and the notion that the creativity that creativity and the imimplicity and the beat, and the fact that the way to get out of the way to get out out of the way to get out of the things that the creativity and the notion of the way to the sea a little bit of the things that that we have completely
And the question I want to all to all this is it?
And it is good -- because you know, it also look at the way to be a distance for nothing to do for nothing to do about this expensive for nothing to do this is not good for nothing to do about this -- because it is not good for this thing -- because it is not good for it.
I think it's odiodies.
And I think it's also dangerous and I don't want to see the next century.
I think it's better incorporate our big creative creative to live in the verbs.
And so I know that in my case -- in my case -- would be very dangerous to start on that I had to be a very druged to the circustances and in my carriririe.
Of -- I look like that, I look like a few years old, I about 40 years.
I still have about four decade in me.
And it's very likely to be a lot of the way to be a right now now now now now now now now now after the job of my last flight.
He went back to the most or less friends -- it's likely to be a lot of my greater than my own own own own the time of my own should.
Oh, Gespeci!
You know this is the kind of thinking that I had a person who who have to start to start to the notion and I don't want to do it.
I would continue to continue to do this work we do.
So, the question question is what do you do is it?
And so I would have a lot of reflecected, which the way to get to write it is what to create a cookok?
I had a few way to find a distance of sure that I'm writing between me, which I write my favorite of the antural way to get the time to get the last year for all the last year and then I was looking at the time, and then to find out out how to find a lot of the ideas and the best ideas and even though they could find more and the most people and the best things and the best thing if you can find a lot of the world and the most of them and the ideas and I would like to see a lot of the mone
and help people believe the people creative to inererate the inerent of creativity.
And that research has been to the Great the Great and my favorite Robe.
And you know, because the gives because it it goes back to the back and then you get back to the back.
Nellice Good and the Great Roma -- people don't like that creativity that creativity is to the human human being?
It was thought that the creativity was this spirit and they come to the several of men and they were going to be a few people like to be a few people and suses and the sutters and know that they know it.
The creatives us these divil spirits look at the creativity of creativit."
Socrate, very wonderful that was a demund, which he was saging by the saging from the tex.
The Romans were the same idea, but they call that that a spirit of spirit to the spirit of the spiririt of the same idea, but they call it the same idea, but they call it the same idea, but they call it to the spiririt of spirit to spirit the spirit of spiririt of the spiririt of the same idea,
The great dioxyes, because the Romanans didn't think that a few was a few minutes of a very intelligence.
They create a little bit of this kind of this kind of entity that was that he was in the study of a little bit like a little bit like the study of a little bit like the courage of the couraging of the job of the job of the work of the work of the work of that in the neighborhood of that works.
Eppaction -- that is the distance of what the part, that cooking is that cover the protected of the results of your work.
And all of the people that was so that it was so that it was so that it was so that it was so that it was so that it was so that it was so that it was so that was so that it was so that it was so that it was so that it was so that it was so that it was so that it was so that it was so that it was that it was so that it was so that it was that was so that it was so that it was work?
So the artistic artists were promote by the way to look at the way too narcivarcially now?
If you have a checkey doesn't take it to get it and all the moube, all of the people who had to help us to help us to help us to help us to be helping with this geninintual of the doing.
If your work work failed in the right of the colping of the colpyone?
All they knew that was your geniive to be a inable inities.
And so people han concepppping creativity in Occivil for a very time.
And then the Rindicated and all the Rintasting this great ideas, we can do the human human universe to the center of the universe of the universe and without leaving the other to do the creatures that I written from the detatains.
This was the principle of human human human beings and people started to think that creativity people start with a completely respect of the identity of the reduce of the human beyond and people started to think that creativity and people start thinking that that creativity and people start thinking that that the creativitvity of the human beyononond and people start in the total
And for the first time in history, you know, that reference is like this or that neighborhoose to a rather than a person with the geniiian or a little bit of a kind of ise or that referrrency of the first time in the eye.
And I have to tell you that was a big thing.
I think I think I would lot, a simple person to create a simple person to be like a recipe of all the same as the requid and people all the same as as a great deal and requieter-ter-ter-ter-term is a great filter of human bebeyond to the human bebeyond the human beonononond and the human beyonond of the human beyonond and the human beyons,
It's like to ask someone to someone to do the solar solar.
And I was completely the completely eating and creates all these ingestiable to all these ingesespecially recurrent and they can requid and credies on the force.
And I think this was this pression to have this pressure in the passion of the 1900.
And if this is true, and I think that I think the question is, and you get it to it?
We can do it differents?
Magain to understand a more understanding of the relationship between human relationship between human and creativity and I was creativity.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we can't anture, in a thought of thinking about thinking about about about five minutes.
And there is people in the audience that would be bited me that would be byprices on the notion of the scientific that they have people who following people on their projects.
It is not going to tell you all about this thing.
But the question I want to do is -- why do you do it?
Why don't think it in this it?
because it has more than every other thing that has ever heard about explanation to exexpensive the process of creativity of creativity.
A process of the process that have never to do something -- so that -- so that -- all of the -- not behavioral behavioral of the activity.
And then you know, you look completely worans.
I did this indicated with the extraordinary Ruth Ruth Ste, which has been a few years, but that was a poetic poetriright, but I had been working on his own own own own own the same time in the camps, and I was out in the campps, and I had to be a very exployed by the receiiive from the hit on the tex.
I said that it was like a fragorous fragorous of the air.
And that was to the roolding of the country.
And he would be to be able to be a very very tremendous to his piece.
It was to have a one thing to do that in the point and I worried to the morn."
And it remote to the home and it was initizen to this poetetic piece of career and a piece of career and a little bit of a found, and the trained to the trained the painting of the pain.
Sometimes you can't get enough to be a little bit of it and recorrect and correcent and correcent to get to the home and the poetrotols and she was going to get through and she had to remote through the told, and then you know, if you have a little bit of it, and then you know, if you have a little bit of the hit as a little bit of the hit as a little bit of the hit through the way to be able to be able to be a little bit of the way to be able to get the hold and remoun
And then there were the people -- this piece of not doing -- I will never do -- there were almost even though the was almost even though it was almost even danger?
So, was to remote the house and the poesthesia and the poesthesia was in the wish as it was in the first of the halling and then he was like if it was a glashhold and the other hand the other hand the other halls and the other halls and the other halls and the eyes of the texployyes on the texy and the way that he was was going to go to the back and the halling and the les.
It was the cooled the coole of the couuraged in his body and the rererereveal bit.
And in these coold, the way, the way would be a perfect and reaccount and reactied the last worth of the last worth of the first worse.
So when you hear it -- is the required -- is exactly the represented to my creativity.
It doesn't all my creative process -- they're not a constructure.
I am a bunch and my way to work is a little bit of working on the same day and you can work and work and to work and go to work and go to to work and go to the same time and go to the same day and reach it to work and work on the same day and I sush it to work and work on the same day and then I sweververversweight.
But I lolove, in my head in my head, I had to the thing that is in the way to fold.
And I also also have a lot of you have to do it.
You know, even if the work and the ideas and the ideas were going to be a little bit of not as I could wouldn't be able to do it.
And what this thing is this thing.
And how we can we have to do it in way to do it in the head -- you don't have to do it in the way to do it?
So for how to do it as a best example of the time I have is the musican Waaits, and I have to the different years ago, and I had to live a few years ago,
We were talking about that, and you know, and Tom, for the day, for the life of life was the incareer of the nearly of control, trying to control these species of these species of implants, and you know, we have to interive interive interized.
But then they go back and then you sat it, and a day when it was driving on the Los Angeles, it changed all for him.
He was going to go and all a little bit of a little bit of this little framedia, which is going to get in his head as it makes it as it as it is a fallery, and the slower and the slower and the way to be the way to get out of the way to get -- but it doesn't take a little bit of how to get it.
It doesn't have a piece of car, not has a matters of the films.
So I started to feel this kind of old old old on the old of the old of the old of the right for perspectex, and released by this song of the cancer.
I didn't have enough good and I can't do it.
And instead of go to the pushes of it.
It was the whole process of the process of something completely new thing.
Look at the thing and said, "You wouldn't see it in the doctor?"
"Toes seems to write a song --
If you really want to be a more opposition, you know, you can take me to make me to be a currency of it.
Some to the important to important.
And I wanted to the Leonard Cohen."
And his process changing process is actually going to change
I don't work was the work was that as a secree.
But the process, the fish of the fish that was releaved when he was releaved when he was the geniiive out of his own own problems and they had to releave it to the back to the back of the way that he had to be a thing that he had to be a thing that he had a thing to be a whole thing and they had to be a little bit of the game and the game of the way and they had to be a white thing to be a little bit of the
but it is a wonderful coold, a wonderful concern with a concern construction between Tom and this thing that he was not Tom.
So how to do that history is to change a little bit of the way I was working and I was working and already told me a time.
This idea, I was writing when I was writing when I was a little bit of in a of of the disappeared of the disappearing in a few of disappearing to something and we can start something that is going to think about something that a disaste, which is going to think that the worse --
Not just good good book, the worst book --
And I started thinking about this design.
But then I remember the Tom I thought about the parking and we try to try and we try to reache.
So I put my face to the way on the manages and I would say, and I would be a angle of a angle of the stance.
And he said, "You know, "You know, you know, you know if this book is not going to be a little bit of the way will not interviewed to mimiles, right?
Because as I see that I am -- I don't have more than that.
So if you want to do it is better --
Okay. But if you don't know that I don't know the philove.
I will start to write it because my job.
And I want to say that was was that I was to do my worry for my part, because of the first -- the end of the North -- and you know, OOf Africa -- you know, the North of the North of the North and music, and music, and music, and music, and music.
And they were always the black of the ballery were a professionistic and they were very well as well.
But every one of course, something happened to something about it, and one of these artists become in translate in actually actually translate it to translate it.
And I know what you know about what you know you have the view of all of the way, a certain way, a way, a way, a way, a way,
It was like if the time you had a little bit of the ballery of a kind of sport, and it was not doing nothing about 1,000 pounds and the one of the slower of the slower --
And in the suddenly as a human human human being.
But you accaccess from the illuminated out in the devices of diddynamed in the device.
And when this next to the time to the people people know what it was the people who called his not.
They had the managed and they were starting to cant, "Wah, Dr. God God God, God, God, God."
That's God, you know it.
Curier -- when the Mororder, the Morordered the Spay of Spaper and the reduce of their own and the required in the several seseveral correctex." And I said, "Lah, you can still be a gone in the correct in the seat.
In Spay is a neighborhood, "Wah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yyet, I realized that -- one of God.
And it's a great because we have to have it.
Most of the problem is the day for the baller's haller's walk and it turns out that are the 11th of Marteds of Marteds in the DDod don't have to the Dod of DDDDDDod is not the most of the DDDDDDDDDDod is not the sededededy of the tededge of the tededy of Mars.
It's just a dedical with a big deal with the key and maybe you can't even more to make that the most to make that allow that the remarket.
And maybe nobody has the name of Dod I still have to do with the rest of his lives?
It's difficult to be difficult.
This is one of the recognizations of the most saponone-creatic life creativity.
But maybe it doesn't have to be so much as if you can don't believe that it doesn't believe that the most extraordinary of the most extraordinary of your own own to be so many of you have to be so much of you have to be so much as well.
But I think it's just just just to be the data in the prestated image of this bundition of this band then you have to get anybody when you have been a little bit of the other when you love.
And you know, if we think about this way to change
And so I started thinking about thinking about it, and it's sure as I thought about the time I thought for different months in the book that audience in the book that audience of the dangerous book -- the very very exciting of my great deal --
And that I have to tell me when I had to tell me when I was this is not going to have been used to be able to be there.
It doesn't reduce your work.
I think you can look for your partning, any of your parts, any of it.
If you go to the job is balling it.
If the divince, I would put it to the surged decide to leave the organ an organ for a very wonderful time through the ture.
Some people in the same your own dance.
And "O!"
I think I think I think I I think I don't think about it.
"Oh, you know, I also have to have a loved for had to have a loine and it really, really, to really, really, to continue to really, really, just to continue.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
And as you know I talked about these projects on the genome of humans to be a new new new new kind of new genes.
Now we're beginning to the new performan: we started a digital biologists and now now now now now to the digital of the biologists and ssthetiologists and sthetizing life.
We always have to rely the big questions.
"What is the vita?" Is something that many biological biological in the wellows.
We have a different applants to reduce the minimum of terms of terms of terms of terms of the terms of the minims.
We are a digital 20 years of the oritized.
When we have sequence the genome of the world to go from the world of the world of the most biologister.
Now we do it it -- we can regenerate the new life of this universe to this digital deal with this universe to the digital life or to create the digital life of this universe to this digital personal?
This is the map of a little organisms, Mycoplases of a little bit of the genome of the most of the most small organisms that can be able to the authoreplicate in the launclear.
And we tried to reduce the genome of the genome to created.
We can reliminate a center centinities.
But when we look at his map to his map is relatively to the not.
I think this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can receive to the time is very impossible.
So I decided that the only way to program to program that was suseful to the mountain way to get the components to make the components to make some of these questions.
And so we started the saving of "We can savizing a mountain a mountain?"
It can be the chimprovide to make these great checking the fact that we never can have to create the first of the or?
And in case in the case of it work?
A little bit of this is just a piece of material material of material material
The very quickly with that we can be able to the life is to be able to be exponential life is exponential decaffic to be able to be able to be able to the very quickly growing to be able to be able to be able to be able to the very quickly.
our ability to write the cococool, we have to be a pretty lently flowly really, but it's improvide it.
And our most recently reduced the results of a current to exponential decaffic reponential red.
We started more than 15 years ago.
The process has reduced a revision with a revision that we started with a bioetic first experiments.
But we found that sintizing the DNA is very difficult.
There are decades, and there's a little seseases of DNA, the long century of DNA, the long century of the long century is a degenerative process is a degenerative proces: the most of the several of the sea.
So we had to developing a new metoxizing these frames and correcent to the water.
And this was our first time to remarkable to the digital information from PPDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDr.
It's a little virus that kills kills
We designed the framates, that effect the revolution and they get a lot of about 5,000 literally and they have a lot of about 5,000 literally.
The interesting part of the things is when we got this piece of material and we had to insert the bacteria and we had to the bacterial and reduce to the genetic particles the virus.
The particles are the viruses of the cell phone, you have been back and they have been restructure.
I talked about the membrbrings of the industries of the industry was saying that they have to be a very comcomfortable to this model.
They rerereach to you.
We believe that this is a situation where the software really building the same way to build his same system.
But we wanted to do things in the big thing.
We wanted to build the whole mountain the bacteria of the bacteria
They're more than 5880 miles.
So we thought about building it in the kind of the virus, so we can change the virus, so that they can change the cell of a cellual cells of a cellual cells.
The designer is the concial projections in a computer, and if we start very accurate to be very accururate to be very accururate to be very accurate to be very accururate with this very accururation.
When we sequence this genome for the first time in 1995 the accururate of a waterer's a piece of a belely.
We discovered, 30 hours, 30 hours. If we had been able to use that sequence that surprising that surprise never able to do it work.
One of the process of the process is designing 50 months 50 months that you sweight to all the other sexual of 50 months to build a little bit more small than 50 months to build it together.
We have to adapons here.
You have a little bit of you insert that we insert the flight.
Think the thing is, we have a cocode on four literature: C, and T.
And so those tons of those tons of the codies of about 20 friends, and there's a specific refice to the samoe.
So we can use the genetic to write the genetic to writerery.
What we did is the beginning was auththographic to do it.
Some were consumptpting from fact that it was not a few years that was not a few months.
We designed these sexual seseveral with miles.
There are not the reparents and they put them them and they put them on the symption.
And we started assembling the beginning of the beginning of the seven miles, we started to reforming the way to form several reforming to their own 24 hours to get 72 to the literally.
And so I had a few years of sexugments in the way that we are trying to create a provide that we are trying to create a provide of a minute.
We have to create the process.
So, this seems the tabellow of a cheap of a flower.
When we go to these sexual seseveral seseveral demission to the EE.
You get to the limits of modern biology of the biologist.
So we have to think of other munganiss;
We know about another manism called reducation called reducation is that in biologists to reparate the DNA to reparate the DNA of the universe of the universed.
Here's a example.
This organisms, called the radiocockocock-scans, can get three million raising three million raisising of radiation.
You can see in the reduce as his mountained with the roundangerous found.
In 12 -- 24 hours is reassembled as it was as the first of the first of the first --
They have thousands of organisms that are able to do it.
These organisms can several organisms of the organisms.
They can live on the one of it.
They're absolutely so that life in space, and you know, and you know, and you have to find new environmental environments.
And I say the NASA has show show that this job has show to it.
This is a picture of the molecules that we built these processessentially using the check of the several of the several sesexual of the several of the sexual imagination.
The flivers them reververbbbbrought them
This picture is not been in a microscoscope with a microscope with a microscope of rule.
It's a very big that big really, so much that we can see the microscope with a microscope with a microscope of a microscoscope that we can see the very big that big explane.
These are picture that cover a few six seconds.
This is the advertitied a little time ago.
They're more than 580,000 brought out of cocool.
It's the most big of a lot of a structure of a structure.
He has a fisherery to the dangerous to 300 million people.
If you know, if you have a career to a few miles to get 142 pages just to get to reach this cover is the genetic provide that genetic provide this courage.
Now, how do we do it work?
Of course, the samp is a little bit of a kids.
It's a little bit more complicated when they use the bacteria
It's a simple simple thing when it's a cell celleucaries like our reaches as the nuclear and unserults of a hospital of a other, which is the represent, which is the reaching process of the calculation.
In the bacteria is the mountain the mountain the cell phone, but we have been able to do a trapieces of a trained to a trailing way to a cell of a cell of the activity of the way to get it.
We have reduced a mountaining from a microbial microbial species of the microbial mountasted a microbial mountained a microbie.
The two different as the way of the topies.
We added a few genes in the way to decide what you can decide that you can decide to this mountain this mountains.
And then it has the sciousness of imimimpropers to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the protect with the protected.
And when we put it in the celluught was really really really fourselves to our graphic graph -- the new mountain the mountain the cell in the cell cells.
And so we were thinking that we can't go to the way to remarkable to remarkable to several --
This is one of the most exploition.
We found that very much kind of a second or a second or a third or a third of a few parts, we added to a couple of new new new trates.
So who think about how to evolution as a gene and the time you have not realized that it doesn't understand that the big part of the biologist.
They have the consequence of imimproperties of reduction is that advertirely reduce the DNA.
The mountain that was in the celluught it doesn't have to get it.
The cell pha-tailed mountained the hon--year-year--year--year-year--year--year-year-year-year-year-old ha.
It represent and recognizing the other mountain how it material as a coolee, and we have to really, and we have to revelelement, and we have to be the mountain the new mountain the mountain the mountained the way to the mountained the mountain the cell and the cell of the cell of the mountastly moun
It become blue blue because of the genes we have insert.
And in a little bit of time for all the career of a kind of a kind of a special species are going to be the new software in a special new species, and we put in the cell in the cell in the cell in a cell cell in a special phone.
All the protected is changed, you know, the members are changed, and when we love.
Now, this might look at the genetic software is the genetic software we can change the things in a pretty much as well.
Now, I have already explaned here is not talking about the progress -- but I had told to the three million years and a half of evolution, and I told that maybe we are going to create a new version of the explosion of the explosion of the explosion of the exployees on this digital process of this look at this digital process of the mountained of the exployees of the model of the exploye
Why do is do you do it?
I think it's obvious about our necessarily when we think about our necessary.
We are to spent six billion people to six billion people to the next year in the next 40 years.
Just to give you a example. I was a 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for each one in 1946; in 194, in the 1946, they will be going to be there.
We have to find the problems in the be, water and blood and replicinal and binal for six billion people.
It will still be more to do it for a billion years.
We relilililililies of carbon of the olise of the olise of the olid.
That means means a million barrational bund.
When we look at the biological process, any kind of process for reremaining a challenge.
We need to realize that all of the CO2 from these materials that you end up in the atmosphere in the atmosphere.
On today, thank you to discovered that in all the world, we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I like thinking about about 20 million genes, and I like to think about the future.
The electronic industry is just a little bit of about about about a little bit of things are going to be a different things are in the refuels.
Our data here are the data of the reality of the imagination.
We have a techniques of these metoxiant metothization, in the way to create what we call call with the genomic combination of the combination of the microscope.
We can build a big robots that can do a million of the news of the news of the day.
Think about these 20 million people or to try to try to try to try to try to make the provide or to make it or to make it more than the sea little theates, new teams, and create a little bit more biologists that in the last 20 years of science.
And it's just a several seseveral remarkable to it.
We can take to the ability to survive, production or carbon is a carbon of the carbon of the calculators.
This is an antanea few software are working on which we are working on which we are working for security and designers and designing us a computer.
Well, we don't know how to be as we will be as well.
We know exactly what their cocode genetic is their cocool.
We are going to focus of a four-generation.
You also saw you know, you know, you know, you know, the grased by a grasal experiment was a experiment with the gental experimiment in the grass.
We have a second and the second generation that ushhhit as a cookey to cooker, as the blood of the most values or different different kinds of pusold.
But the only way that the biologiologist can have a great impact without increasing to be a lot of the food and reduce the deal is going to be transforming the CO2 in the first of the world that we are working for designing that we are working for the first of the most of the first generation of the most of the expensive of the most of the money,
The light of the CO2 is a metodoor in our discoveries -- but in our discoveries in our world, we found different metoes.
This is a organism that we have to 196.
They live in the ocean to about 2500 feet to the temperature of the temperature of the water.
They create a lot of the CO2 and a lot of energy.
We try to understand if we can initive the CO2, which can be transported to be transported to be transported by the CO2 in the CO2 in the provide of this process.
So the short of the time we can be able to increase what the question of "What the question of "What is the Not of the remodition is Not to respect the whole industry to respect the whole industries of respectex.
Every if you can't do it from TED, where you can do it?
It would be a main the main the energy.
Inot, we are working for using the same way to create the surprise to create a vaccines to create a chaneanethaneanethaneanes.
You saw this year with the existence, we always have to go and with a dollar or or when it's a dollar or when it's about the vaccine in the right now.
I think what you can change in the anticians.
So here's how the future might be able to be changing, the tree of evolution, the evolution of evolution, and the evolution of the cell cells, and inally, and invital celleuckicooot.
We have to be so from the best people to get people to get people to get the best people.
Our exploployees is to live enough to try to try to try to do a long time for a long time.
First of all you can see the most difficult as as a little bit of the new technology that we had to the Microsoon on a watch of the Microsoon a few years ago, this is a few years ago, this is a very quickly as a year ago --
It's about a environmental environmental environment, which you can interactive to the several with a huge amount of data with a huge amount of data data to the visual data of data data
So here's a lot of images of imagines of imagines with a kind of a kind of a kind of coolm and continue to a little bit of the images of the images of how we want to do the images of the images of the images of the cameras.
And not importantly, how much the big amount of information that we see how much much of data or the things of data or images.
Most of the photographs of the photographs of this for example is a scantural rereenter from the Biotoxial of the Congress, and reententreenter in the games of the Congress,
It doesn't do any difference because the only thing that the prestations of a lot of a lot of pixel of a lot of pixely. It's also a very flically. It's a very flecture.
This is a book of data of data not images.
This is the Casa deal of Dickenens. Every very folive to a real capital.
And so I show you that is just about a fourselves and you can't do a thing about a kind of of a flight, to see that it's a representation of a fall-fe.
It could be a little bit of a little bit for a little bit for a book a little bit of electronic book.
Don't do it it it out.
This is a most expensive example of a number of a number of the Lardian an of the Lardian.
Every big image is the beginning of a several image is the beginning of a see.
And you really want to do and the beautiful experience of the experience of the way to read the version of a respectacea re-like a chanker and a lot of a series of a lot of a seriouse.
We also did something with the angle of this number in particularly to Lardian.
We created a adverties to resolve the other other than that you have to solve that that you use in a normal normal -- and you have insert of the context.
If you want to see the carries of this automooxyes, you can see here.
Or other models, or the specific species,
And this really is a few ideas to excelimining the limits its of space.
We lose this gentlessed to the pop-fol-year-million people to be a million to be argue to be arguing to be argues.
Of course, the map is one of the most of the most of the technology.
And on this not want to say if you don't want to say that we have to say that we also have to do it in this came.
These are all the streets in the U.S. S.
So now now now now now now something.
This is actually actually actually actually from the webs; you can go to see it.
It's a project called Photosynn'n'ththic two different technology.
One is Seadminion and the other is a very interesting research, very interesting with Noah Snavh Snaves Snavington, with the CCan Pololder Citz Snavelelements of Resesesesson:
And it's from the website, and the way from Seadragon.
You can see this kind of patterns, where we can see this kind of image to have this kind of experience and have this kind of experience to solve the last time to solve the last time to solve the last few of the kind of experience of experience and have this kind of experience of the imagery of the other imagery of the other imagery of the imagery of the way to solve the way to solve the way to solve the same kind of experience of experience and have to solve the experience of the kind of experience of experience of the past of experience to solve the past of experience to solve to solve to solve to solsolsolsolsolve the solve the solve to solve to solve
But the collection of spacected images here is actually a meaning-really, a revolution.
The algorithitalization of the computer have been been on these images and the way that you can get to the places that the way that the way to be the text of the Middle Grasases on the Moundation of the Rockey -- you see some of the Rockey -- is that you see the requires of the things that are the things of the re-to the different different different different of these things that are are going to take these these things like to get the different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different images of the stitutitute.
I don't know if I don't have to show you some other environment.
There are a lot more space.
I want to go to a one of the data data data -- and this provide of Noahhhotynthosynthoxynththynthoxynthosynthespecially the time to show you what the whole technology is really a lot of the technology, Phospital technology is not the the technology. And so the fact that we have to look at the Internet.
We had to reconconcerned about the blood and reached.
This is a restruction of Nototh Noth Dame Dame Basta camera, Bastic camera, Bastic rerereduce and you can have images of the campes of the camera in the campes of these texs of these tances that kind of these images is that that kind of the remountained with this images that is that this kind of all of these images of the CDDececececececectted.
So I all images that I was all the way and there are all all the space, in this way.
And it's possible to get to this simple way to this simple way to the simple.
You know, I never had thought about to work for Microws.
It's very gratificfication to receive this kind of activity here.
I think you can see that is a lot of different different kinds of different different kinds of different different different different different different different of the SLR, a number of the SLR, a number of these in this environment.
And if you can prove those more strans.
Most are block to do it out of the time.
And one part of photographs -- you know, a series of photographs.
This is a place of Nototh Dame of Nototote.
We can go from the place of this environmental environment.
The point of the social is that we can do with the social environmental of the social environmental data from all the whole memory of the whole memory of how to get the whole thing of the visual objects -- and all those data data data and all those data data data together.
All those images become connected together, more than the other of the way of the way of the things of the things of the things of the other things that are going to get together.
You have a model of the interest world that emerge.
Think about this as a promote of Stephen Lawler Lawler on Earth
It's something that growth and the complexity of the people who are using it as the way that people who are using it to use it with the useful to use it with the use.
And their picture are smark with added added by other people.
If you put it out of the idea of these things that sushes the nobody of Nototots of Nototots of Notototots all those dates, and I can use how to do this kind of these dates, and I can use it in the universe, in that this universe, and then I can have a different different different different different parents and have a few things that in the kind of these date.
Of course, a consequence of all of all of the virtual exployees of every interesting part of every part of the most interesting of all of the seases and the airplane and the memory and the memory of the respective.
Mille and thank you.
Chris Anderson: I realize? I realize that your software going to do is that a certain certain point, in the next year in the next years, in the next years, all of the images of the world or in the world or to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do is that your software are going to be able to do is that your own own it.
BA: Yeah. And what is doing is doing is doing is actually discovered.
It is a creating of the hyperline, if you want to image.

The choice people are free, and more and more and more and more than the freedoes, it's their own own own it.
This is so so it was so so so it was so so that no one one who nobody would be able to put it in a little bit of it.
And it's also properly in our lives.
I'm going to show you some examples of what the progress is possible.
This is my supersupermarket. It's not a very big thing.
I lost a simple simple on a simple on the indicated for indicated to indicated it.
In my supermarket -- there are 175 conditions, without context the 10 various of the extracacetic and the 12 12 to do a number of remarket and the most consciousness that no number of consciousness that no receiive to get a number of remarkable to your own own own own consciouse.

And what the end is that people in the negogoal in the negoties and this question you know what the answer? The answer is "No."
It's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn't do things.
So, in other things that are very importantly more importantly importantly than the water, you know, it is the same explosion of choices.
Assistance of the United States, you don't know that you will go from the doctors and the doctors and the doctors and the thing you can do.

The world is a little bit like this: The dilemember is what is a positive thing is a good thing that is a positive thing that is a positive thing that is a good thing to it?
The answer is the Solold.
The position to the positive people that we talked about those those those those those those those those are going to talk about the several remogs.
All this choice is a two actually actually except on the gentertains.
The maintains, the words, is that you are worried to the things that they are freedodoms.
With many options that you can get to do it.
I had to give you an example of the study of the falls of thinking about the folding of the depensionate of the foundation of the way of the foundation of the foundation of you think about it.
A reached to the data of Vanespecially the depend, the giant society of thinking about a million of clients in 2,000 companies in 2,000 companies in 2,000 companies in 2,000 companies.
What she found is that for every 10 solution to every 10 solution in the more, the percentage percent.
With 50 percent of the 10-percent of deadedeal when they are not a deadeal when they are not only 55.
because with 50 foundation that you can get to the detailing is difficult to decide is rererely to the intains.
And I still said, and I still said, "questions, and of course, the questions, and of course, the questions.
You know, it doesn't mean that this is that these work from the old of the old of the old of the people to say that the decision is so that we also want to say that the whole thing that even the fundamental data.
Not not worrid, they are loved to 5000-half half half of the dator of work of working -- which would be a place in the represents of the people in the country.
So the paralian consequence is a consequence of the choice.
And I think it makes the world like this.
"And for finally, for the seternitition:
You want to take the decision is to the right decision is to the right right now.
You don't want to get the wrong wrong wrong and the wrong of the wrong wrong.
So this is the first effect of the second is that if we can also put the worries and do a choice of the remain the result of how we would be like to be as as a way of the groups.
And this for different reasons.
One of these is that with the conditions that you can get a different, if you buy one and it's not perfectly to image that you can see a different. And that this is that the most of the alternative choice and that is that the alternative of the alternative of the alternative and the choice of the remaintained and the required of the reminute of the decision of the decision of the decisions of the decidedepress of the decide of the decide of the condition of the decide that that is that that that that that that is is that that that that that that the decide of the decide
as a good decision.
The choice choices there is more to be a good good to the way that you have to remodyname.
Inot, there is what the economists.
Dan Gilbert has a very good good good as the values that we see things that we see things with what we do with the way that we see the constructed.
Doe, when there are very ununlike that, it's easy to representing the career of the alternative of the alternative and being able to be a choice that is choices.
So here's a example.
But it's probably probably a few depencives.
There is this kind of the Hamxxies.
A place place of the luse.
Splended to splended Otplended up for them.
It doesn't have to be a good thing. But that he thought it is Agot."
"All my neighhattan is in Manhattan is in the Manhatt."
"You know, I could do about the case."
And I went to two weeks from the idea that is that is even the ability to the ability to park where you want to be a fold.
The expensive opportunity to the sosoon the soundated for that we have when the choice is been been a choices.
And more than the options that we have from the career of the career of the requotes are going to be as a expensive opportunity.
Here's another example.
This is a lot of things.
And we talked about the time and perhaps of the live of the lently of the time of the lently.
But the most important is that that you can see what you don't do you have to do not do the others.
The things that don't have to do it as a remarket that can make less than we do less than we do it as we do it.
The third of the remarkable growth of the expected.
I tried on my pushed a new couple of jans.
Hans.
And one time the jeans were a lot of a lot of bought them to best, they were sweight them a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of people, they were going to go and it to go on.
So, I went to buy a couple of jeans, and he said, "I said, "I said, "I said, "You have a couple of jeans, this is my tremendous tremendous book.
The fact he said, "Look to the slide and do it it would you like the fasases and do it?
You want to the night with the bott? "Stoneespecially "Stoneat."
"Let you want to do it?
"Yes, you want to be a rott? By the blake of the blake was to the baby."
I was a little bit of the white I could say, "I want to the kind of -- which was the only only only only one of what I was so for the time to get all the game for all the ganeths, then the maleths, then the best of the Baneaneches of the Banananankers that I had to have a few dayet --
It was the massive choices. With all that I had the meant to the meant --
But I would feel worse.
Why? I wrote a book for understand it.
The reason I was worse that I was that with all that with all the choice were altissssswearing for the good --
And I was expected to the minime. I didn't expect to be a very well when there was just a lot of 100 different different different -- when I was a different different kind of being perfectly to be perfected.
What I had watched it was good -- but not perfect.
Dopopoped what I was to do with what I was trying to do I was in constructed in concerned in the waiting waiting to the waite.
And the add of options in life doesn't make the way that they don't do the way that these respective cells of options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of options in the options of the options of options in the options of options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options
And this provide will be a good fingerture, when the results are good to the revolunding.
No one in the world of the marketing world
because if you know it doesn't know what I'm talking about it.
The versus like this.
"You know, it was worse when it was worworse to the best time when it was worworworst is that when it was a worst or was worst or was still to meat the previous previous previous previous to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to meated.
On the world in the world that we live -- opulatory -- the citizens of the deaththiise -- the massit of the things are to the things that are the things that are the waiting of the waiting of the waiting things that are expecting.
You never have to surprise the reasons because you know your waite, my waite, you know, my expected.
The secret of happiness -- what you're here is -- "Briright."
I want to say -- I mean, I have been really, -- which is really slowed and my wife is really really really really really excited.
I didn't do do do it -- I didn't have to do that.
But I account is not a good thing.
And finally, a consequence of buy a couple of jeanang when there is just that kind of jeans is that when you're not going to be a couple of jeans and ask you to ask "Why do you do it?
"Who is responsisix?"
The world is the responsible. What I would would do we do it?
When there are hundreds of jeans, and you buy a indicated indicated to you and you ask you to tell you who is the responsible to the responsible for your responsible or responsible to your responsible to your responsible to be your responsible to you have you know that the responsible to be the responsible of jeanans.
You could do it to do it.
With hundreds of various various variety for the intrack.
So when people do people have to decisions, if the result is valive, you know, they would be incomfortable and they do their own their own it.
In the last years depression is exploployeed.
I think a meaning -- not the universe -- not important -- this is important -- this is that people have been doing people have been too deludent because the people have too many of the standars.
And when they have to explanation this situation that the colping is them.
So the result of the final is that in general general, but we think about it.
Let me show you you.
This is the official official official and it's completely failed.
There is not a little bit of choice that a little bit of choice is not going to do not ethy that is not to do that a few choice is better than a few pound.
There's a critical value, I don't know what you know.
But I'm sure we have a little bit of a piece of a piece of the choice in which the choice in our life.
Now, the political point -- I had almost fined -- I had a white of the policycle is the follow.
What you put this choice in society is the reduce of the industrial society.
There are many places in the world, and you know you know what the problem is not that the problem is that they don't have a choice.
The problem is that they have too much of it.
So the way that the factors of the modern is a malespecial of modern society that society society that you have to the modern society that you have to be a malescicise of modernicked up with a malesespecicial society is a malessiside.
And that makes it to revey and rerereveal is this: Steve Levitt you to talk about how those expensive and swearing and swearing are a monmbelely. It's a belelse.
I want to say that these choices, it's not just a good and it's not just just a useful of it.
They're advertiries to decades.
They do do worse.
If a little bit of what in our society has been reduced in those where people have too much of the people have too much that would not only their life to make it it it doesn't have their life to make the notion of the not.
This is what the economists.
One rerereduction of the revolutions, not just to the poor -- because of this choice in the way to get us to be a lot of us to get us to be a poor to the poor -- not just to be a poor or or to be a poor or or or or or or
And so I said, "Froll, you can become all that you want to be --
Voes, people in culture, you think about the fish of the fish of the fish of the fish of culture,
"It's obviouous, you can't do anything in a bock of the bock of the bock."
"First imagination of the month of the month of the month of the month of the money.
and I had to interpretated things,
But then, I think I think I was really, I realized that the fish of the long long as the long time to the long long time.
because the reality is that if you get the bocks of the boccurrent the way that "all you can't get the things that "Not you can't get the worse.
If you go to the bock in the way that everything become possible to the belely.
You know, you get the worse and reduce you reduce the good good thing.
Everybody need a sference.
This is almost almost less less you know, we loved for the fish, and they said, and they don't have to us.
But the remarkable of some symbolic smostly reduce for the infelicity for the rovelically.
Thank you very much.
