And the last year I showed these slide to show that the artical calculation glacial tears for almost three million years had the sizes of the United States in the United States in the United States of the United ed ed States for 40 percent.
However, this subvalues the gravity of the problem because it doesn't show the sessor of ice ice --
The art glacial calot, is in a sense, the heart of the global climate system.
You expand of the inverse and returns out.
The next slide will be a rapid rapid to be a couple of the last 25 years.
The ice lots are lots of signed in red red it.
You can see it hit until the blue screen.
This is the ice in wind, which is the summer of summmer.
You can see the ice called the ice glacium, or five years or more, is like the blood slights, which is a blood out of the body.
In 25 years was passed by this.
This is a problem because the interests is that the ground artren, where there are huge amount of carbon of artic carboncongeled that we have a location of carbon and microbies.
Rember the totality of the atmospheric instance, that amount of warming, that amount could radicate not.
In some laghi deeply in Alaska meter is already reboiling from the water.
The professored professor. Katey Walter the University of Alaska has recated team in a team of the based lake,
Wow! Wow! Wow! Al Gore: Wow! Something is if we are going to be the well.
A reason is that this exchange is that this termic exchange from the north.
This is a glacial record regime glacial record.
The taken had never reached levels.
This is the Kangerlusaxsuaar and in the south of the Greenland of the Greenland of the Greenland of the Greenland in the South of the Greenland of the Greenlusay.
If you want to know how the level of the skin the skin on level of the level of the level of the sea.
These rents are increasing rapidly.
On the other side of the planet: Antarctics, the biggest block of the planet.
The months in the scientists have declared that the ice of the ice is in negative and that Antarctics, which Antarcticcent in the Western share of the submmmatter in the sheet.
Equid six feet of water in the water as the water as the Greenland and in Greenland of the water as a hundred level of water, like the Greenlevel.
Himalaya, the most largest block of ice block of ice block -- a few years agholds were ice in the laghi, who were a glacium --
40 percent of the world's population was recovered half the population of the population of the population of the world's population required.
She says this glacier is the source of the water of this city.
The brushed is increased.
But when you dimine, the same thing happens to the water water potaken to the water potail.
In California Sierra Nevada is diminuthrows of 40 percent.
The richs are in crisis.
The predictions, as you have read, are float.
The growing world in the world door in the world in the door of incended.
The environmental disasters are increasing a record out of the normal and without precedent.
Four times more number in the last 30 years away, in the last 30 years of respect to 75.
This is a sustainable of instainable to it.
If you look at the context if you can see the consequences.
In the last five years we added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the oceans every day.
Look at the area of the oriental Sific Pacific, from America and both of the continent of the continent of Indian indian, where there is a radical imposal of the oceans.
The greater is global warming, together with deforestation, which is 20 percent, is the using combustible fossils.
The oil is a problem, and the carbon is even worse.
The United States are one of the most emission, together, together,
And it proposed to build a lot of other carbon of the carbon of the carbon and flow.
But we're assisting to a shift change.
These are the annulled projects in the last few years and some of the veries of green alternative alternative projects of vers.
At every way, there's a political lotly politics in our country.
The carbon industries and oil industries have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote clean bone year, which is a oxymore.
This picture reminded me reminded me somethings.
Natan, in the Tennessee, where I live, there was a 3.8 billion gers.
Maybe you saw it on the news.
This is the second biggest flow of scories in America.
It happened around Natma.
The natalize, of one of the carbon industries was this.
Video: Shyth, the carbonaio is a half like and happy.
It's abundant here in America, and it makes our economy.
Frosty carbonaio is more and more cleaner.
It's a good instead, adorable and workers are keeping the stipen.
Al Gore: West Virginia.
The largest society on the mountains is Massey Coal. This is his frienderator.
Video: Don Blankenship: I'm clear, Nancy Pelogies, Nancy Pelogic -- they don't know what they're talking about.
Al Gore: Al Gore: The Deance for the Clima has launched two nails.
This is a bunch of it.
Video: Attore: At COALery we see the climate changes like a minum of a minum of minum as a service minum of the business.
So our priority is invest a great amount of money in a public effort to make public and confuses the versus on carbon and confuses the carbon carbon of carbon of carbon of carbon of carbon a carbon of money
In fact, the carbon is not sport.
We think it's pulled -- it's also a good profum.
So not predictately.
Let me do you down.
Video: Attore: Attore: You know, you heard about it.
So let's do a framework in a structure to the framework for how carbon for the carbon of the carbon digite.
Straordinaro! The cars are a little whee, but this is the sound of the technology of carbon technology of carbon technology of carbon technology of carbon technology of carbon technology of carbon technology.
The carbon is between the main of global causes of global warming, but the night technology of carbon technology of carbon that you see change.
Do a look at the technology of carbon technology of carbon technology of chpulite.
Al Gore: Infinally, the positive alternative positive is connected to the economic security.
Video: The America is crisi; the economy, the economy, safety safety climate crisis.
The film that college all of the face that the connection of fossil fuel filled fossil fuel and the important.
Now, there's a new audance for using solution for circles.
Big America: 100th of clean energy in 10 years.
They plan to stay America to work and help us to work and help us stop the global warming.
Finally, a solution that is solution that we solve our problems.
Boy's America. It bought more.
Al Gore: This is the ultimtimtimate
Video: Here is about reducing energy to America.
One of the fastest ways to bring dependence from the combustible combustible combustible dependence.
She goes on is here. I mean, sole, a new network.
She shot 2: Numpher's investment for places of beyond job.
M: My America. It's time to be realist. It's time to be realist.
Al Gore: A proverbbie African old saying, "If you want to go fast, go to the so.
If you want to go away together."
We have to go away, quick.
Thank you very much.
The year at TED fect at TED fect in LHC.
And I promise to return to you to add you on how the car.
So here I got it up, and the other time they didn't have the other time -- the LHC is the biggest scientific experimented -- 27 miles of miles of circumstance.
His to realize the conditions that were less than a billion second from the beginning of the universe -- until the second.
And all is this is just environment.
This is the underneath Gineva.
We photographs these mini-Big Bang Big Bang in the relevators.
This is what I work. It's called ATLAS -- is four feet and has a 22 feet and has a 22 feet of feet --
This is a spectacular image of ATLAS in building so you can see the proportions.
The 10 sets of the last year, we have access, we have the car for the first time.
And this picture was taken by ATLAS.
It was immenses fest-fest-fest-hop in the control.
It's a picture of the first particles of particles who had made all of the LHC, entering in the LHC, and spread particles.
In other words, when we see that this picture the 10 set, we understand that machine work, which is a great liftye.
I don't know if it was to exact us to expect that when someone went to Google and saw that the page was this.
That means we had a cultural impact that scientific impact to that scientific impact.
About a week, it was a problem with the car, had to be a problem with the files here -- these sleeps -- these sleeps -- these sleeps -- these sleeps -- these sleeps -- this is a problem with the machine, which was a problem with the car, which was a problem with the car, which was a problem with the car,
These films bring 13,000 prints when the machine works at the bottom of the power.
Now, the technical technicians will look at film and say, "It's not true. I'm film too under this."
And they can do it because when they are very cosidence become the superconvictor files.
So, at least 271 degrees, a degrees, to a instop in the space between the stars, these files can bring that corrent.
In one of the most of the most of novemies in the LHC, there was a fabrication.
So the film is survey that they read up forward and 13,000 printing suddenly met was a resistance to an electric.
This was the resulted.
Now, this is even more impression, if you think that these magnets are more than 20 tons than 20 tons and that came out of about 30 centimeters.
They have damamn about 50 magnets.
We had to leave you, what we did we do it.
We have repristine and add them up.
They're now returning all of their place under the ground.
Entro the end of the LHC is is going to be new integrated integrate to be intes;
We will accession -- we expect to get the data or he says to get the data or he says to get the universe.
Now, of course, in a certain here, these accidents returned the debate of science and engineering in the science and engineering in frontiers. It's easy to confuture.
I think that the fact that it is so difficult to go beyond the limits, I think is the value of things like LHC.
I would like to conclude with a scientist Ingless, Humphrey Davy, which image, in defense of inuseful experiments of his pull, his pull, his pull, his pull, and he said, "No he's a very dangerous mind of human mind is a very dangerous mind of human mind of the mind of the mind of the human mind is not a complete, and not a new world's mind of the world's mind of the world."
Thank you.
I want to start asking you to rethink about here, as a children, played with a children, played mattons.
Whereas you understand how to realize them and realize, taking them and moves, learn to think and resolve them to think and resolve problems and manipulating relationships.
The space of space is deeply connected to the way we understand a lot of the world around us.
So, as informed by using the usal usual objects of our interaction with physical objects in my consults, and my collaborator Jeevan Kalaniths, I started asking: "And if we use a computers, instead of having the only one of the mouse as a policy that moves on a half as a policy that moves on a house that we can deal with both information with both information with both information with both of both and a hands:
and we put it in our please?
The question was so interesting that we decided we decided we decided we decided to explore the answer to the answer Siftable.
In a few words, a Siftable computer is a big interactive computers.
In a few words, a Siftable computer is a big interactive computers.
You can move them to move with hand, they can see their movement and have a radio and have a radio wireless.
But more than the point, I'm physical objects, as the matter of the morning, you can just realize.
The Siftable ext of a new ecosystem of tools to manipulate information.
And as they become more physics, and as a movement, of the others, and the others, and as they become more physics, and as they are becoming more physics, as we motion, of how we can motion, explore and interaction, we can explore new style stilds and interaction.
I'm going to start with some simple example.
This Siftable is configured to show video -- if you including it in a direction, the video it will be like that, if you can see it from the other side of back.
These interactive riticians are aware of others.
If they are them interested in what they are going to be around the time.
If they come circumstop and they can agitate a little bit.
If they come circumstop and they can agitate a little bit.
They also have their movement and inclination.
We realized that one of the interaction was the interaction of the interaction was to use communities on the data, "example of the pursus as if it was a liquid.
In this case, we have three Siftable configurates like a sky-bed skets in the central central central central source, where they mix.
and I can use them to the color, where you missing them in the central central centers.
If we get a little bit of it, we can put a little bit of it up.
There's also beautiful possibilities of learning, like languages, mathematics and players where people can try and see the logical things and see the results.
I'm going to --
This is a Fibonacus that I do with a program.
He's a game of words that is half between Scarabeo and Boggle.
Pratically, at every turns out you get a house on every Siftable, Pratically, at every turns on every turn Siftable, and as you try to get words of parts of sunly-deling words of a dictionary.
Then, after about 30 seconds remissing, and you have a new set of labor set, and new possibilities to try to try to try to it.
Thank you.
Here's the children came to the Media Lab, I did it so they tried them and I did a video.
They are pleased mold.
And one of the interesting things about this genuinition is that you don't have to give people a lot of education.
You only have to say, "The ponds of words, and they know exactly what to do.
Here's the other people who tried it.
This is our youngest beta test bete, there in the right.
It was actually wanted to imply them.
They were only battonfic for him.
Now, this is an application of a interactive carton of interactive carton
We wanted to build a tool for the language of Lui is Felix.
It can inserve new characters, in the scene, setting Siftable to make Siftable Siftable to ink.
It can inserve new characters, in the scene, setting Siftable to make Siftable Siftable to ink.
So, it's doing the sun.
Video: The sole is smigene.
David Merrill: He's taken a treat in the scen.
Video: The aran.
Bel work!
So I was schools and put it close to make it interact the personages --
Video: Bau!
-- inventing your story.
Video: Cao!
DM: It's a story with final apeped, and it can decide how you get him.
DM: It's a story with final apeped, and it can decide how you get him.
Video: Vole,
DM: The last example I have the time to show you is a tool, realized recently to execk and exective and exeguess.
it's a tool, realized recently to sample, and execrast,
The Siftable here are sources like based on the bottom, based on the bacteria.
Each of those has four different variations, and you can choose what to use.
You can get these sound sound in a sequence to your floor of your please.
And modificate it just doing to touch a "sound to touch a sequence."
These are effects that you can control from living, as the movie and too much.
The attacks to a particular and then including to add it.
And then there are the general effects as time and flight in the sequence.
We look at how it works.
Video: DM: We're going to start a base in two Sift," we will put a sequence, we will add the extend, we add the other base.
I put a bassroom line.
Video: DM: I add to the percent of the percent ussion.
Video: DM: And I'm going to put the movie to the bacteria, so I can control the effect of live.
Video: I know -- I can fast the whole sequence inclining the time from one or the other.
Video: DM: And I'm going to add the movie to the based to give more expression.
Video: I know about "I can get the sequence of the sequence to the face of the face of the volo."
So I didn't have to planning the first one, but I can improvise, make it longer or the corty.
And finally, I can get the whole sequence inclining the whole sequencing on the left to the left Siftable to the Sift."
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is building new interfaces to build new man-machine and more look like our brain and corporate the brain and body.
And today, I had time to show you one of the results of this perfect and some possibilities that we try to bring out of the lab.
The concept I want to transmit you to do this new generation of objects for interacting with digital media design-information in our world that we want.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the hour of talking to everybody with you.
I'm a write writers.
Soring books is my profession, but it's more than that, of course, of course, of course,
It's also the love and the fash.
And I don't aspect that can change it.
But I said, something particular is successful recently happened in my career, who brought me to realibrate the whole report with this work.
The particularly thing is that I recently written this book, this is called "Mangia, Ama" -- Ama" -- I was going to be broken in the world and became a big thing, and it became a big charge -- and it became a big interactional sensational.
And the result is that everywhere from now, people are people treats like they were convicted to me.
By true -- convict: convict!
They come from me and they all worry about and they said, "You wouldn't be afraid to do better?
You can't afraid to continue to write all of life without could be able to create a book that can be able to create a book that can important?"
that can be important to someon?"
It's reassure you know.
But it could go worse -- I remember that I remember 20 years ago, when I started to say to people -- I was an adolescent -- I was a trick -- I wanted to be a trice.
I met against the same reaction of the same reaction of the fear.
And people said, "Don't you get to success?
Don't you fear that the humiliation of kills kill?
You can't fear of do this mestive for all life without any life without any of the swimming on a heart of frankly or basis of location of flip of flight?"
So, you know.
The answer -- the short answer to all of these questions is, "S."
I fear of all those things.
I always had fear.
And I also fear of many other things that people might not have to be ine.
As the algaa and other things --
But, as I think about writing what I thought and asked me ultimously asked me to be the ultimously why is?
Is it ration?
It's logical that anyone who who have to be expected by a work that I feel like to do it.
But what is so particularly in the imprese creative impreses to be nervous health h of the mind of the other career doesn't do that?
How my father, for example, he was a chemistry and I don't rememistry in his 40-year-old activity where he was asked if he had to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineering chemistry in his father, for example, he was a chemistry in which I rememistry
It never had -- that block of John, how do you know?
Doesn't it works?
Enestly, chemical engineers as group don't certainly, in centuries, the reputation of being hilized maniacs.
We have enough of this reputation, and not only about writers, but creative of every general reputation of all sorts of geners, we have this reputation of being huge instable instable to of mine.
And it's not rest that look at the contains of the deaths of magnific deaths that only in the 2th century, they die and often for their own hands and often for them.
And the ones that they don't have suicide seems to be really disagreed by their woms.
Norman Mailer, before I die, in the last interview said, "Ogny my book killed a little more." And a extraordinary remarkable to work of your life.
But we don't get the way when we heard about why we heard about why we heard about it in some way we can actually have all interiorness and accepted the notion and suffering the notion and suffering the wind, it will always last, it will always drops to the anguy and the art of the anguguys at the end of the angood.
And the question I want to ask all of the today is you agree with this idea?
It goes you go to this -- because it looks from a centimeter of me distance to me not good for anything that supposed to do this suppose.
I think it's hodious.
And I think it's dangerous and I don't want to see perpetuated in the next century.
I think it's better to encourage our great minds to live.
And of course, I know that in my case -- in my case -- it would be very dangerous to that they had to feel like I had to feel like I had a career.
Obly -- involved -- I looked at four years.
I still have about four decade of work in me.
And it's very likely anything that I did write now in the world will be right now that the world as the work that came after often, I was a very success of my last book.
I'll be slavery, because we are all more or friends here -- is probably the most of friends in the of, is likely to my banks.
Oh, Gesus, who though!
You know this is the genuinition to a person to start to begin to the morning, and I don't want to do it.
I would keep to do this work that we are.
So, the question becomes to to the question becomes to that?
And so I seed to me after a lot of reflective to continue to write is to create a psychological construction psychological construction psychological construction of protet, okay?
I had to find a distance of security of me, that I'm writing, and my natural refairly write that reaction is going to get E, as I was trying to get E, as I started to look through the time for the time to look through the time to see if they started looking through the time to see if they could have more societies to see if they could have ideas and more healthy ideas and health power and health societies and health societies
how to help people to make people to manage to manage emotion.
And that researches has taken to the ancient and Roma.
Seguitems because it turns out to go back and then back.
In the ancient Grecia and ancient Rome -- people didn't look like creativity creativity came from man, OK?
It was thinking that creativity was this is about the wine and that was selling to a few surface and unknown and unknown as well as well and unknown and unknown out.
They called "Deeal called "demoniors of creativity "demoni."
Socry, wonderful, believed to have a demon that elargiving wisdom of long.
The same idea, the same idea, but they were called the kind of spirit without a genius.
And that's great because the Romans were not really thinking that a genius.
They believed that a genius, this is kind of divinced that it was living in the walls of the study of a artist, a little bit like Dobby, and that was out of the art Dobby, and that was out of the argu's work.
Excital -- et, that's the distance of which is the psychological psychological that psychological psychological that protects you protect you from your work.
And everyone knew that was so that it working, right?
So the antic artists were protent to certain things, like the too narcissm, no?
If your work was exceptional work was not to take all the market, everybody knew that was helped by this genius.
If your failure, it wasn't all your falls, right?
Everyone knew that it was your genius.
And so people han conceived the creativity in Occident for a long time.
And then the Rinachieved and everything changed and all this great idea; we put the human being to the center of the universe and the mysteries and without leaving the creatures and no longer leave and without left by divinity.
This was the principle of human exciting and people started to think that the creativity came completely from isharing completely from ishare.
And for the first time in history, it began to refering this or that artist as a rather than a genius.
And I have to tell you, I think it was a big mistake.
I think that allow someone to believe to make someone to believe being like a fragirl, like the source, and the source of all my mysteries and fragile and ethern is a film to be a film to be a too to be a film to be a film to be a fragile of human fragile and eth,
It's like to ask somebody to enjoy the sun.
Deform and completely the evidence and creates all these ingestible ingestible expectations on performance.
And I think it was this pressure that I destroyed artists in the pasts in the pasts of the past arts.
And if this is true, and I think that is the question, and I ask the question, and now?
Can we do it different?
Maybe to go back to a more ancient understanding of human relationship between human and creative.
Or maybe no no holds.
Maybe we can't cancer 500 years of rational thinking.
And probably there is people in the public that would be suspects of scientific suspects on the notion of the notion that following people are going to follow their projects.
I'm not going to convinced you all about this thing.
But the question I would like to ask is -- why is that?
Why don't you think about this way?
Because it has more sense than anything that has ever heard to explain exciting exasperant impredictionbility of creative process.
A process, as anyone that I've ever tried to do something -- so fundamentally, everybody here -- you know, you don't get rationally behavior not.
And, in fact, it can seems completely paranormal paranormal
I did this met recently with the extraordinary poeter Ruth Stone, who has 90 years old, but that was a poet, and he said that during his childhood and he said that during his infection in the rocket, and he felt it in the field, and I felt it in the counter, and I felt it in the landscape.
He said it was like a fragorous tren.
And he came rolling to her landscape.
It felt going, because he had to do the ground under its feet.
He knew to have a one thing to do to that point and it was saying, "Do you run as a morn."
And so it goes to home and it was following from this poety; it would be able to make another piece of paper and a fairly in a fastic paper, as the translate and and and a broken the past, and rearries it on the page.
Sometimes couldn't be enough fast, so it was run, so it was running and correcked up and poems to get in home and the rolled rolled through and she would have to roll through the landscape, and he would have to roll through the landscape, "another poeta."
And then there were those times -- this piece never forget the moments that was never forget to losing allowing almost lost, OK?
So, he was running at home and he was trying to meat and the poetry was looking at a broken in the way it was going to go through the other hand was like, and then he said, he was like if you get away with the other hand and the ef.
He was the poemed poems from the coda and he had the body and it was a rope on the page.
And in these cases, the poems would be presented on perfect and intacts and intacts to the first one of the earlier.
So when I felt -- it's exactly the way.
Not all my creative process -- I'm not a convict!
I'm a mule, and my work to work is to see it; I see it at the same horarian every day and sweet.
But even in my head, I went to my bear, I went up against that thing, at times.
And I imagine that many of you also have the face.
You know, even if the work and ideas and ideas came up with a certain fundamental fundamental sources I could have to know it.
And what is this thing?
And how can we relate to that it under the head, but rather than the head, rather than making sanies?
And as I reck about the best example I have is the Tom Waits, which I interview that I interviewed different years ago for a day.
We were talking about this, and you know, Tom, and you know, Tom, the majority of life has been the incarnation of the artist of the artist of the clean to control these species of creative impulses to creatives to totally interiory.
But then he hot hot and he was driving on a highway to the autoway.
He was going to fast, and all of a tract tract of this little fragmental fragment, which is to be an inspirations, elusive and ethic, you know, it's wonderful, and you know, it's wonderful, but you don't know how to take it.
It doesn't have a piece of paper, it has no paper, it's not a recorator.
So it began to feel this kind of old old old old old old the little bit of the hold, and I'll get hossession, and I'll remarry us.
I'm not enough enough and I can't do it."
And instead of go to the panic stop.
I'll put the whole mental process and he did something completely new thing.
She just looked at the sky and said, "Sore, you can't see I'm driving I do that?"
"You seems to write a song hor?
If you really want to exister, back in a moment when I can take care of you.
Other and walked to get somebody else now.
You go to disturbing Leonard Cohen."
And his process worked after that.
Not the work, the work was still the work, as you know.
But the process, and the anxiety that was released when the genius, the genius, the genius, the genius, the genius, the genius, and realized it was realizing that he had to be an interior realized and back to the mind.
but well, this piece of bizarre collaboration a conversation between Tom and this strange and external things, but it was not Tom.
So I felt that I was going to change a little bit also saving a little bit of a little bit of a time.
This idea, saved when I was writing "Mangia, Prega, Ama," and falls in one of those of those dispersing of those disperation of the disperation of the disperation that will be a little bit of a despite that will be a worssse.
Not only bad written the worst book written written
And I started thinking about designing this project.
But then I remember Tom who talked to about the air, and tried us.
So I went to my face on the handwritten and I would say my comments to a nack of the room of the room of the room of my face in the room.
And I said, "Yeah, well, both of you, both you know, both that if this book doesn't be brilliant not be brilliant not be very colp, right?
Because as you see I am doing all I hadn't going to be more than that.
So if you want it to be better and do your party.
Okay, if you don't do it, you know what about it, I don't do anything.
I'm going to write the same because it's my work.
And I would like to do that I have recorded that I today today I presented to me to do my part, because of the end of the North -- secost in the North people radicated for the long people to the moons of the moons and sacross the moons that they were going to go to the high and the high basic hours and until the high to the high be.
And they were always magnific because the ballers were professional and they were fantastic and they were fantastic and they were fantastic and they were fantastic and they were fantastic and they were fantastic.
But every tas, rary, something happened, and one of these artists became in reality transananscend.
And I know what I know is, because I know that you have all of them to a point -- a performance like that.
It was as if the time stop, and the ballery walking through a kind of walking through a kind of ball, and it was not doing anything from the sun, like 1,000 earlier, but all of them would be able to holds.
And sudden, not only as a human human being.
But you access to the delent and under the divinity of the divinity.
And when this was happening, the people who knew what was, people knew what was, they were called his name.
They had their hands and they started to sant, "Ah, Doh.Allah, Doo, God, God."
This is God, you know.
She note historicics -- when the Mors invaded, they presered this habitude with their own and pronunes with their own and pronounced in the section. Ah," which you can still feel in the sources or in the flow of the corride or in the flow of the flow of the corn of the float of the flew or of the float the floor.
In Spana, when an artist has made something impossible and magic and magic -- "Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, burg, and incomprehensible, etimes -- a short of God.
And it's great because we need to do it.
But, the problem comes the down, the baller's ballery -- when you wake up and discovers that are the 11 of Martedday and the Dod is not more.
It's just a death, with a gram with the knes and maybe never be able to ascut that altheist to that height to that altheist althy.
And if no one cancer's chanters of God while and what does it has to do with the rest of his life?
It's difficult.
This is one of the most dolorous reconciliations.
But perhaps not to be so angoodsing if you can not believe it, it will be so extraordinary to you, who are the most extraordinary expects of your being come from you to you.
But believe it just came to you from a square that you given from a squisite squisite of your life that you have to go to somebody else when you fine.
And, you know, if we think in this whole way of change.
And so I started thinking about it, and it's surely as I thought for several months during the work of the book that I'm going to public book I'm going to expected, dangerous, exactly followed by my great deop.
And what I have to keep on the electric when I feel electric is not going to fear that is, not fear that I have to have to be fear to be fear to say,
Don't short. It only your work.
He reaches to present you to press you to you, anyway.
If your work is ball, ball, ball, ball.
If the dive, I assurd to you decide to leave some kind of wonderful to leave some kind of wonder, for one moment through your efforts through your effors, then "Ole!"
Altriments, you do the same tube.
And "Ole!" to yourself.
I think I have to teach it.
"Ole!" at yourself the same as well as human love and test text talks to you to do you really pressing the same.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
As you know I've been talking about some of these projects on human genome, what can meant and discovering new genes.
We're starting a new location -- we started to digitalizing biology and now to go from that code and now from that digital code and synthesizing and synthesizing and synthesizing and synthesizing and synthesizing and synthesizing and sintetizing lives.
We always tried to take a big questions.
"What is life, is something that many biological biological biological to understand various to understand various levels.
We tried to have different approaches, reduced to the minimum minimes.
We're digitalizing by almost 20 years hours.
When we sequenced the human genome was sequencing from the analogical world of biology to the digital world.
Now we ask us to regenerate life, or create new life from this digital universe from this digital universe that
This is the map of a little organism, the Mycoplasma genitalium, which is the most smallest genome genome of those who can autoreplicate in laboratory.
And we tried to reduce the genome to create a little bit smaller a little bit more smaller.
We are able to eliminate a hundred genes of about 500 who are here.
But when we look at the metabolic map of metabolic map respect to the now.
See, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can elimine, one at the time, is very improbably that this can bring to a live.
So we decided that the only way to progress to be synthesizing this chromosomes so that we could modificate the components.
And so we started the wursure of "Can we synthesizing a chromother?"
Can chemistry to produce these great molecules that we never had to create before?
And, in case of busines?
A chromosome is just a piece of inert.
The speed with the speed that we are able to digitalizing life is growing up at exponential rely running to exponential rely running to exponential rely fast.
Our capacity to write the genetic code of instead, progress, but it's better extremendously them, but it's better now.
And our most results the results the door on a curve.
We started 15 years ago.
The process has requires a lot of past, beginning with a bioet before the first experiments.
But we found that synthesize DNA is very difficult.
There are thousands of cars of cars to the world that small segments of DNA, of the moon's length of 30 to 50 feet and it's a degenerative process is longer -- the most errors is longer errors are going to be more errors are going to be degenerative to the world of the world that are more errors of the world that are
So we had to develop a new methodd to assembling these fragments and correct the middle and correct the middle to assemble.
And this was our first attent, to particularly from the digital information of Phi Hef.
It's a little viruses that kill batteries.
We designed the fragments, effect of the error and got a molecules and got a molecule, about 5,000 literally framework of DNA of fragments,
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemical material inert and we put it in the bacteria started reading this genetic code and producing this genetic code particles in viral particles particles in viral particles in viral particles in virtual particles in virtual material particles.
The virals are then released by cells, are back to cells, back and they have framework and have destroyed Elles.
I talked about recently with recent members of the oil industry says they certainly understand this model.
They have more than you.
We believe that this is a situation where software can really build its hardware in a biological system in a biological system in a biological system can really building its own hardware in a biological system can really build its own hardware in a biological system can really build its own hardware in a biological system
But we wanted to do the most in big things.
We wanted to build the whole chromosome.
I'm more than 580 miles of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code.
So we thought to build it in the size of virus, so that we could change the cassetes to understand what the cassetes are a living cell.
The design is crucial information is crucial information in a computer, these have to be very accurated.
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 the accurniture was a mid-basic miles.
We found it, resequencing, 30 errors. If we had that original sequencence, we never had been able to do it work.
One part of the process is designing along 50 lets that are going to be recording to all the other segments of 50 feet to build underneath tiny to build underunder tiny and working together.
We do things like a elements here.
You probably have read that we read that we read of the great filie.
Think about that. We have a genetic code genetic code genetic code genetic code and T.
Three of those labsh multiple broken together, and there's a specific order to be able to read, for every love, for every love.
So we can use genetic code to write words, frawn thinking.
What we did about the beginning was autographic to have a self-ographer.
Some were deluses from the fact that it was not poem.
We designed these these segments to just just unique them with a person.
There are gain that they repaid them and put them and put them up.
And we started assembling of the parts, beginning with segments of seven miles a segments to make 72 miles of miles of lots of 24 miles to get to 72 miles to get to 72 miles to get to 72 miles at least to get to 72 miles the literally until segments to get to 72 miles a literally
And every step we produced these segments in abundance so that we can sequencing them to create a extremely robust, as you will see in a minute.
We're trying to automatizing the process.
So, this seems to be the tabons of a bag of basket.
When we get these very longments very longments, the more 100 miles and more than 100 miles will not grow more directly in Eth.
It comes to the limb tools of modern biology.
So we have to consider other mechanisms.
We knew another mechanism called "recombination of homology, which is in biology to repaid the DNA biology to repair DNA degrade of the seats.
Here's an example.
This organism, called Deinococcus radiodurans, can assumption.
You can see in the square as his chromosomes came up with the destroyed.
In 12 -- 24 hours is reassembled exactly as it was before.
They are thousands of organisms that are able to do it.
These organisms can be able to make completely sily.
They can live under the vacum eight.
I'm absolutely sure that life exists in space, and you move to find new environments of water.
At the very, NASA showed that this lives.
This is a picture of the molecules that we built using these process, just using the design with the design appropriate segments.
The lievish cars to the automatically.
This picture was not taken with a electronic microscope, but with a microscope to rule.
It's a molecule, so that we can see it with a microscope with a microscope.
These are pictures that covered a period of about six seconds.
This is the publishing that we did a little time ago.
I'm more than 58,000 letting genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic
It's the biggest molecules that have ever created by man.
It has a molecular heavy soer than 300 million of them.
If we passive it with a 10 caratter without spaces, there would be 142 pages to transcreen to make this genetic code of genetic code of a code of type with a type of it.
Now, how do we do it work? How can we activate that?
Of course, we tracked a virus is a girls.
It's a little bit more complicated when they use batteries.
It's more simpler cells as well as it is cells as our res: you can just extract the nucleus to get the nucleus another one and they would be the process of clonation.
In the archaea archaea is integrated integrated in the cell, but we recently showed that we are able to do a complex transplant trapier, that we are able to do a complex cromosome,
We can get a chromosome from a microbial species in a microbial species.
The two are different than the men are from the touch.
We add some gene in a way that we could decide what to chromom for this chromom for this chromother.
And then the skill with the gass in a way to kill all the proteins.
And when we put it in the cells was stuff -- and you appreciate our graphic graphic graphic graphic -- the new chromosomes went into the cell.
And we started thinking we can't go to become to beyond it, but we have a common to the side there.
This is one of the most execchanisms.
We found that many species have added species have added a second or a third of a few hundreds of new trates of new trates at that species.
So who think about the evolution as only a gene when you have no way a gene of biology.
They are called the restrial restrial instances is that addictions are degerising DNA.
The chromosome that it was in the cell.
The cellphona-cell phones we put it up-ha.
It looks like, and it has recognized the other chromosome, and it has masticked the cells and we are recognized with only the cells and new cromosom and new cromoom as an extent of the cromoom as an extended material like the cell as an extractly extrement of the cells like an extractly extremice, and it has a new cell as a romoom like an extrac
became blue because of the genes we put in genes that we meat.
And in a little lass of time, all the characteristics of a species are lost to lose and a new species, and it turned into a new species, which we put in the cell.
All the proteins are changed, the membranes are changed, and when we read the genetic code genetic code of what we have transfer to you.
Now, this may seems alchemistry genetics, but altering DNA we can change things in enough maniera enough sustainal enough sustain.
Now, I explained that you don't talk about genesis -- but to progress from three million years from three million years and half million years and I said that maybe we are to create a new version of the Cambrian explosion, which will create new species about this digital process of digital process of digital process.
Why do I said, "What do I do that?
I think that's enough obvious when we think about our needs.
We're going to go from six billion and half billion people at nine billion in the next 40 years.
I'm boring for example: I was born in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for each one in 194, in 194, there are are going to be four years, there will be four years, there will be four years.
We're going to have problems now to find food, water and clean water and clean and bency and gas, medicinal and half billion people.
It will be more harder than hard to do it for nine billion.
We get more than five billion carbon of folding carbon of olies.
That means a hundred million barrels to a day.
When we try to find biological processes or any kind of process to replace to replace them, is going to be a huge challenge challenge to be a huge challenge to be a huge challenge of trying to get a huge challenge of biological processes to replace to replace to replace to be a huge challenge to replace to be a huge challenge.
We have to keep in the most of the CO2 emission, which is the CO2 from these materials that finishes in the atmosphere.
At day, thank you for scientific discoveries in the world, we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I like to think that are the components for the future.
The electronic industry has only one dozen of a dozen side of a dozen side of things came out of it.
Our limitations are data principles of biological and our imagination.
Now we have technical techniques, thods to synthesization, to create what we call the combinatories.
We are able to build a big robots that can produce a million chromosomes a million chromosomes at the day.
Think of processing these 20 million different genes or to try to get to optimizing the processes to make a broken bad to make a small team, and to make more biology team, and create biology that in the last 20 years of science.
And it's just a standard section.
We can choose for possibilities of survival, chemistry or carbon or carbon and of carbon getc.
This is an instantanea of some software programmed to be able to be able to seat us and design species to design species and designer.
Well, we don't know necessarily as they will be not.
We know exactly what their genetic code of genetic code.
We're concentrate on the carbon of fourth generation.
You see you also see that you can go out of the gran ethanol was an experiment in the grand was an experim.
We have floors of second and third generation that will be pretty soon as a carbon of higher burants like eight or different kinds of further than the types of butanol.
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without a big impact of food and limiting the cost of food and limiting the CO2 in prime to prime -- which we are working for cells that we are working for cells to get cells that can reach cells that can reach these discovery, and we think we could have the priest carbon generation in about 18 months.
The sunlight to combined with CO2 is a methodom -- but in our discoveries all the world, we found different methods.
This is a organism that we described in 1996.
It lives in the ocean deep deep about 2500 feet of deep feet of the water perature of the water.
It takes it from CO2 using hydrogen molecular energy sources of energy.
We're trying to understand if we can get CO2, which can easily be transported by maybe transported your own training tubes, to drive that CO2 in carbant, to drive this process.
So we think that short we could get to increase what the basic question, "What is the life," is Noe, truth," is Noe, truly -- we have the modest of the oil industry.
Exactly. If you can't do it from TED, where you can do that?
It would become a major of energy.
Also, we're working for using the same methods to create vaccines.
You see this year with influence, we are always background of a year and a dollar, and a dollar, when it treatment to find the right vaccine.
I think that that this can change building vaccinable combinable combinable in ancient an anticip.
Here's how the future could start to change that we can change it, now, the tree of evolution, accelering the synthetic batters with synthetic archeos, and infinally cells.
We're so much as much as the best people.
Our purpose is to make enough to try to do it to make it choice. Thank you very much.
First of all I'm going to see the most quickly possible, some fundamental work that we took Microsoft in the Microsoft in the following water in the follow. This is Seadragonon.
It's a environment where you can interact is a local level, which you can interact with a huge amount of visual data --
We're seeing a lot of gabyte photographs with a kind of digital and continue, for a fast-cost and continue, to be able images as we want to hold images as we want.
And it doesn't matter how big information that we see it, as we see -- how big we see that data or images.
Most of them are communicates, but this for example is a dead scansion from the Bilibrary of Congresss," and reaching in the game, and reaching in the game, and reaching in the game.
It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that the prestations of a system like this is the number of place in your screen on your screen in any moment. It's also an architecture.
This is a book inter, example of data not images.
This is the Dicken's Ssolved Dickens. Every couple represents a capitol.
And to show you that it's just a test of text and not images, we can do something like to see that is a real-representation of the head, not a photo.
It could be a little bit an artificial book a book electronic book.
It doesn't take it to it.
This is a more realistic examp. This is a number of Guardian.
Each pictures is the beginning of a section.
And it gives you the pleasure and the beautiful experience of read version of a view or a quotic version of a quotian experience of half a very much best kind of half though.
We also did something with the angle of this number of the Guardian.
We created a fasulla high resolution -- much higher than -- much higher than what you use in a normal publish.
If you want to see the characteristics of this cars of the cars of this cartoon the feature of this cartoon the cars of this cartoonistics.
Or other models, or even specific specific specific charges.
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limitations of space on the screen.
We hope that this means to put pop pop and other porters, and other porters, not to be necessarily to be necessary.
Of course, the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology.
And I don't want to lose the time if not to say that we have contributes to give it in this field.
These are all the way in the USA obobstands on a NASA.
So we go through something else.
This is actually actually from living on the web; you can go to see it.
This is a project called Photosynth, which two different technologies.
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual computer very interesting to Noah Snavely, a student of the University of Washington, with the See See Seliski Seliski Seliski Research. Seliski Research. See Reschrosoft Resch. Seadragon and the other collaboration.
And it's from Seadragononishing from Seadragonon.
You can see it when we do this kind of screen where we can go from one picture of the other and have this kind of experience to the other kind of resolution to multiple resolution --
But the space of the space of images here has actually actually a meaning.
The gorithms of visualization of the computers have made these pictures, so that they can realize the real sets that imagine, all the neighborhood -- all the neighborhood in the Grashs -- have been taken to the Grashs -- have been taken element of a slidestable slide-show show shows all the space of space.
I don't know if I have time to show you some other environment.
There are a lot more space.
I want to go directly to one of the original data set of Noah-- and this is from a precedent prototype of Photosynthosynthess, which I think about the first time -- to show you what the key is really the key to the technology -- I'm going to show you what the environment, technology that we put in the webthenvironment, and it's not such as a extend to be a set of the web.
We had to worry about legal ways, and so on it.
This is a reconstruction of Notre Dame pictures made by Flickr. Basta digitate in Flickr. And you get pictures of the guys in the day, other than the field of the field of the field of the arguments that are appearing a picture that is discovered by appearing this model.
So I'm all the pictures on Flicklevel in space in this way.
And it's possible to navigate in this simple.
You know, I would never have thought of finish to work for Microsoft.
It's very gratification to get this kind of like this.
I think that it's a lot of different kinds of fun of fun of fun of focuses to the photos in the cell those cells in the SLR, a multiple significant number of significant mess.
And if you can try to do those strange strange.
Most are blocks, etc.
She got a series of photographs -- etcolor.
This is a Notre poster Dame Precorrectly recorted.
We can go from the placer to the physical physical physical physical physical view of this environment.
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment. This is now taking from the whole memory of view -- from the whole perspective -- and you college all those data together.
All of those pictures become college, most of the same.
You have a model of the land that we emerge.
Think of this as the Stephen Lawlabor's work in the virtual Stephen Lawler on Earth
It's something that is grows in complexity as people use, and people use, and the people to use for those people to use.
Their pictures are marched with other people.
If somebody is the idea of contransforming all these sants saying the name of the cedral Notre Dame improvised in the Notre Dame immersic and I can use it as a point of all those data, and I can use the point of ind in that universe, in that universe, in that universe, using the photos of the spread of the skype and the red of the spread of the sent of the spread of the sent of the sk-ushool s;
Of course, a consequence of this is that are extremely elaborated every interesting part of the earth, rather than the plane of the plane and satellitaries and similes, but by the memory.
Thank you very much.
World World World Would you be able to understand what your software will conve us to do is that at one point, in the next few years of the photographs shared by anyone in the world will be practically college to be practically college with that?
BA: Yeah. That's what it's doing is doing is actually discover.
She creating hyperlins, if you want to be in images.
And it's doing it based on the bottom.
It becomes very interesting if you think about the wealth information that many of these images can have a lot of these images possibly images that many of these images can have it.
And as you do a research, you know, you have a fract on the web has a lot of fract on the web has a lot of information about the pictures of the pictures of photos.
Now, what if that picture is college to all your pictures to all your photos do?
So the amount of interconnection, and the amount of rechethens that is really huge effect of rete. It's a retasy effect.
CA: Blaise, is really incredible. Compliment.
BA: I thank you very much.
One of the main of the main of the major delic researches is the power to live in the wind of the people who have no forgotten the anti-traditions, who has no forgoes in the wind, you touches in the wind, the square of the plants.
Basti is thinking that sciamans Jaguar is still beyond the Way of the ancient Inuit are still covers of meaning, or that in Himalaya, budholes are still drawing the respire respire Dharmal the importance of the central importance of the anthropologia, and the world that the world we live not exists in a sense of reality, but it's just a model of reality,
the consequence of a particular choices that our stirps that our stirps has done, many generations ago.
And, of course, we all share of essential trates.
We all all the way we produce.
We're subjects in the beginning.
We have to deal the inexorability of dead, so we don't surprised us to go and balliam, and whales --
We all have a art.
What you know is the particular is the particular song, the range, the rhythmon of every culture.
Not matter to the forest of the Borneo, or the follows of the Haiti, or the Haiti, or the Worriors of the Kaissut in Kenya sectonal Sahara.
He was my journey of trip, in the desert a month ago, or a yak in yak in the garbrooms in the world of the world.
All of these populations teaches us that there are other ways to think about other ways to think about other ways to think about other ways to move in the world.
And if you can get a moment, it's a concept that can give you hope.
And so so the cultures of cultures of the world create a raise life and cultural and cultural that has been floates and is important for the well-being of the planet so as the raise as biosphers.
And you can think of this cultural raising cultural as an ethnose. And you can call the ethnose. And you can call the etho-sum subway of human dreams, dreams, ideas, dreams, inspirations, intuitions in the human imagination from the consciousness, intuitions in the consciousness of consciousnes;
The ethnos: is the fantastic patrimonum of human reality.
It's the symbol of what we are and what we can be in the species of what we can be in the species of inquisist of what we can be in the species of what we can be in the species of the symbol of what we can be in the species of what we can be in the species of inquisise.
And because the biosphere was free consumed high-rectased as a recent and purposes very quickly.
No biology, for example, it would say 50, is that 50th is on the orest extinction because it's false -- in the most apocalthesiest -- in the most apocaltic diversity -- in the most of biological diversity -- and not near the populest -- that is the most of the cultural diversity -- that is a falthy of cultural diversity.
The indication of all is the language of course, the language.
When you were borns existed 6,000 languages on this planet.
One language is not only by a vocabolary or from a series of rules of rules gram gramph of rules.
One language is the human spirit of human spirit spirit of human spirit spirit of human spirit spirit of human spirit spirit of human spirit spirit of human spirit spirit of human spirit spirit of human spirit spirit spirit of human spirit spirie.
It's the meet with which the animation of every culture comes in the material is in the material world.
Every language is a forest of mind, a thinking, a thinking, a thinking, a thought, an ecosystem of spiritual system of spiritual system.
And those 6,000 languages, as we sat in Monterey, at least half the half of the children, the children.
They don't get more teached to children, who means that you don't change something, which is already to be dead.
What is more than the sad of being flown from the silence, of being the last to talk to a language of the daughters of the children, or anticipate the wisdo?
This is a foundation of somebody in some part of the world every two weeks of the world every two weeks of a ancient mother and brings with spoke the last one language of an ancient language.
And I know somebody is going to say "Is it "Is it better that?
The world would not be a better place if we all save all the same language?" Well, we talk all yoruba. We all locant. We talk all are the way to cantonese.
We talk to kog.
You'll be able to do a tract thing that you can't talk your language.
I would like to do you make a journey through the ethnoise.
a little journey in ethnose.
Most of us forget that when I say "different different ways of existing really existing different ways of exist.
We take for example, this Barasana, in Amazon Shony, in Amazonia popular bad of the anaconda, which creates to the milk of the milk of the sandwalks in the skin of the skin of the sken sacries.
It's a population of the population that is not able to distinguish the blue color, because the sets is identified in the forest, from which is identified popul.
They have a strange language and a mathematic, "examia called "Exoamy language -- you have to get a different language of the language that a different language.
And all of this has radicated in the mythological mythological is that in these families are talking about seven or seven language because of the matrimons are talking about mystics and no one language.
They listening to listening and then they start talking.
We take one of the most interesting tribes that I lived with which I lived -- the Waorans of Ecuador Ecuador who had the first contact of the first contact in 1958.
In 1957 mission missionaries have tried to a comprehense of a fact that they had a face.
They did it from the floor that they had been retent that they had lovely, who had lovely, forget that this population of the plug forest had never seen nothing of bi-dimensional sheet.
They raised the photographs from the ground, they have a researching or a figura and a figura -- they don't find that it was the divold, and they kill five mission to the five mission with the lances.
But Waoran't kill the strangers.
They knew between them.
Five percent of mortality was caused by their own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own location.
We are risalitites to eight generations and we found two natural houses, and when we insisted for know, they have admyself that one was instead of mind, and then killed it was instead of mine, and then killed it down. She had a knowledge, they had a knowleducation of the forest.
The cactors were able to recognize the animal for 40 steps and recognize the species.
In the early '80s, I was assigned a very interesting compiece when my professor of Harvard asked me if I wanted to go to Haiti in the society of Duvalier society in the power of Duvalier and Tonton Macoutes, and impossessing and impossessares and impossessary's poison to make sugain.
To give a sense to miracle, I would have to understand the Vodouble, and that the Vodouble.
It's pretty much of a complex metaphafix.
Very interesting.
If you ask you to tell me the big religions, what would say to me say?
Cristianystiany; Buddhyo, Eibrush, etc.
A continent is always left out of it, thinking that sub-Saharian has no feed religious religious -- and the Voodoo is not that the distilled of these religious concepts of nates in the tragics of the slavery of the slavery of the slavery of the slavery.
What makes you interesting the voodoo is the intense of life and death.
So you can see the spirits.
The spirits can be invocated by the Grande Aqua, they answer to the dance of the dance and replace to the soulder of the way that for a short of the way that for a short follow.
So you know, they love to say "You get white to say, "You get to talk about God.
We damage in the temple, and we become God."
And from the moment you are able to you, is the spirit you drive you drive you the male?
So you see these incredible events of these incredible events of the exciting of the trance that touching points income a rather demonstration of the power of the power of the power of the power of the mind when it's catalyzed in a state of extremence.
And all the popules that I lived the most extraordinary are the Kogi Sierra Nevada de Santa Mars, in the Santa Mars, in the Santa Mars, in the sant.
Sholdling of civilization that once they live on the caraibon plans of Colombia in the attention of the conquere, the popular blood vil massive that was on the floor.
In a blood continent blood blood has never been conquered by the spagnow.
At the today I have governed by a classroom is decidely.
The young people are taken from the family to three or four years, and living in a world of good and living in a world of good and bombs in the foundation of glaciers for 18 years.
Two of nine years of choses to reproduce the nine months that are reproducing the nine months that they have a metaphorically, now I'm metaphorically, in the utern of the Grande Mad.
So this time, they get acculated to the values of their society, values that they pretty much as they prejoin and only their prejob to keep the cosmic balance, or to say the balance.
At the term of this incredible beginning, they are suddenly taken out and for the first time in life in the age of 18 years, they see a alb. And in that active awareness of the first of the basis of the first wrong, when the suns the sun of the beautiful lands in the explendoring in the whole of the beautiful way:
"Do you know how I did said, "Do you have to you.
It's stuff is to protect yourself to protect it."

When we think about the populations and the environment of the environment of the old history of the noble history of the noble history or maybe we ask Thoreum or maybe we are closer to the Earth's closer to the Earth.
The indigens are not feeling of indigenes are under indeed by our algies.
There is no space for these things in malaries of the malaries of the Ahsmat the gelies of the Tibet, but because of the time and they created a mystic of the Earth is not on the concept of the basic butter, but on a little bit of a beyond can only live because it's infuses only infuses from human consciously under human consciousness is not a human consciously subtle-a-human consciousness --
What does it mean?
It means that a little girl of Ande who grows believe that the mountain is a spirit of the mountain is a destiny human being a destroy of a very different relationship with a very different report of a very different boy or that place a girl, and that place a girl, and that place a girl bag is a badadlamorous rocket.
That is the dimora dia or mineral was a mineral is irrist.
What is interesting is the metaphor that defines the metaphor that defines the report of individual world.
I grew up in the forests of Columbia creating that forests served forests to be cut up.
And he made me a different human beings who believe that they believe that they believe the forests who believe the Hukuk and the well-death and the well-well-wing wells living in the world in the northern history of the world, spirits that live in the world in the beginning.
If you start to consider that these cultures can create different reality, you can start to understand some sensations. We take this plant. We take this plant. We take this plant.
I took this picture to apply the normazon the normal Amazon the Western Amazon.
Maybe some of you have heard about the ayayax, the most powerful substance of the repertorious sciamanic repertorious sciamanic repertorious sciamanic repertorious sciamanic repertorious sustains about the most powerful substance.
What makes fascinating the ayayaxis is not the potential of sustance, but his elaboration. It's compon from two elements. It's compoor of two elements.
On one bathen, this liana that conties a series of betah and harm, harmly hardly and harmly allucinogen.
Pring the sun is a broken smoke a little bit of a viewal that alter, but it's mixed with the folds of a family of the coffee of the coffee of the coffee of viria and viria a viria of viria viria a viria little bit of virids.
This plant, conties powerful contimilar to the serotonina, dimetho-haldimethoxoxoydimethoxoydimethoxydimetho-xydemeythoxoydimetho-xydimetho-xydimetho-xyltrysimithoxed slydimetho-xydemethod.
If you ever see Yanomami to you can see the sustain, the sustance that they do from a different species, anchort of species, anchor, there is a methoxydimethox.
Tird that police is a little bit like being sparated by a little bit like being sparated by a bunch of paintings and land to land to land on a mate of electricity. It creates a distortion; it creates the reality, creates the reality.
I had often I was often with my professor, Richard Evan Shultes, the man who had scates the psychedelic, with his fungi in the 1930s in the 1930s in the 1930s in Mexico.
Second my testhesis you can classificate these triptamin-hallucinoxized because if you don't tell anybody to be able to be absolutely because they have monox. It can be absolutely because I'm money by a inner income from a innest monoxiety that you find in the intestine, as a matter of monoxized monoxisis.
It's possible to assumers only if they assumption, which money with other chemics who are money to the MAO.
Now the beautiful thing: The betah better, which is in this lian is inbitors of MAO, the same kind of ne-like trips to potential to potential to potential to potential of 80,000 species of piants, like these popules are doing these popules to find two demorphologically not -- but if you combined a biochemistry that is that is sum to the square of the particular one of the particular version of the particular thing?
We use the great euphemism of proof of of proof of of the proof of the proof of herror, which can revealed it.
But if we ask to Indians, they will tell us "The plants to tell us "The plants of us to tell us "The plants us."
What does it mean?
This tribess, Cof, Cofan, 17 variety of ayayaxx, who distinguish in the forest, and that we are going to be in the same species.
If you ask the way they were like, they will tell us "I thought they are going to tell us "I thought I was not able to understand how much of the rest doesn't know everybody?" I said, "No."
The solution is, they take 17 variety in a night of a while, and a plena while, and a different tun.
With this is not a Harvard, but it's much more interesting than to content the stames.
Now, the problem is that the problem is that also have heart popular popular popular popular popular bags of reduced to the margin the world of the real, and past.
In fact, the 20th century, 300 years, not going to be remember for his wars or its innovations or its technologies, but rather as the technologic that we were stopped and we have embrace aced and we have instantly accepted the destruction of the planet.
All cultures through the century are involved in a dance for new life.
And the problem is not technology.
The Sioux not stop, they were not stop, when they put them from a part of the people who have been sent to be Americans don't stop, they have been side of Americans have put out of the horder.
It's not the change or technology that they threat the integrity of ethnow. It's the power.
The during the domination.
And if you give a look at the world, you will discoveries that are not cultures to disappearing.
They're living and dynamics and dynamics out of identifiable forces that are beyond their own own adaptations.
And I know that you can see the deboxing of the guys of the guys of the guys --
a population of Sarawak, in Sarawak, a popular population that has lived in the forest forest to a generation in the forest to a generation and produced to the prostitution, where you can see the rivers, where you can see the rivers, where you can see the rivers of the light to the book hourth of the Mdional Cinese Mar Cinese Mar Cinese Mdions, where the navors were the Japan Enavo-like horrow of the Japhoness,
sounds to fill the style stick with the underneath the forest.
Or in the case of the Yanomami, are the diseases that are coming with the discovering of the or.
If we move on the mountain of the Tibet, where I'm doing a lot of research, you will see the during the political domination.
As you know the genocide in the physical extinction of a popul, is convicted to universal level, but the ethnocide of a popular popular environment, not only is convicted in certain in the environment, because it does part of development.
And you can't understand the suffering of the Tibet until you get out of the bet beginning.
I have found 6,000 miles from Chinina in the Western China occidental in the Western Cina and a young and a young college, but only came to Lhasa I realized statistics that we heard about the statistics that we heard about it.
6,000 world's sacred monuments in policy and cindeed,
1.2 million people killed by military Rivolution in Cultural Rivoluion.
The father of this guy was ascritual in the Panchen Lama.
which means that it was killed to the Chinese invasion.
Her is coming with Santity in Santity in Santity during the diaspora that has taken the population in Nepal.

The smile did the same, it was put in the field of reeducation.
A day has involved a stand-hot bursting Main or a Maje, for this transgression was put in seven years.
The Tibet of the Tibet can be instable, but the redental spirit of the population is to keep present.
And then it turns out to a choice.
We want to live in the world, or we want to live the world or we want to choose the policy?
The great anthropologist, before the Margaret Mead, before the model, in our world, in our world, in our world, we don't just see the whole gamm of human imagination of human imagination of human imagination of the human imagination of the human imagination, but a day we can see a day we can see a day we can see a little bit more possible.
And it's a birth of remind that our species is excited for 600,000 years.
The Neolitical Rvolution who has given us agriculture, who did us to slightly in the seeds of the seeds of the sama of the samp of the same, creating the gerarchia of specialization, and we talk about 10,000 years ago.
The modern industrialized world has 300 years.
That lid sklid of history not to suggests that we have the answers to have to face in the thousand and I was going to have to come up.
When these myria's cultures of the world is asking what it means to be human available to have 10,000 voices us.
And it's in these answers that we all save the possibility of being what we are doing -- a consciousness, which has to do that all the popules and all the popules and all the popules can phyer. And there are great moments of optimism.
I took this picture on the north of the north of Baffin the She's isola whales of the Inuit, and this man man was told me with the wonderful story of his grandfather.
government is not always always gentled with the people in the 1950s to the 1950s to stabilit our own map, we have them requires in colonies.

We want to talk about hors? And this is nothing? And this, in different ways? And this, in different ways, [Applausiz] is the symbols of the popular indigenes and all the popular indigenous populations.
In the open-1999, the canadese government of the chanadese of a territory of a territory of the California and Texmesses together.
It's their new path. It's called Nunavut.
It's an independent territory. They are all the resources.
One of the splended, as a country can reconciliar with his popular popular popular with his populum.
And finally, I think it's pretty obvious to those of us is in these remote areas of the planet, remote that they don't have remote that they don't have remoted.
For somebody is home.
They represent sections of human imagination that they risaling at the high of the daughters. And for us all of our children, as the dreams of our children, become part of the hope.
Finally, National Geographic is we convinced that politicians will never get anything.
We believe that the polemy --
[Applausive, they are not persuasive, but we believe that stories can change the world, and maybe we are the best institution, and maybe we have the rest stories of the world. Each month our weight recently reaches to 35 million vise.
156 countries to be our television of our television --
Our reviews are are literally from millions of people.
Our work is traveling in ethnos: the evidence in the hog of the wonderful cultural place from which they have seen by how they saw hope, hopefully will be able to reveal reveal-a-pologists of anthropologists in diversity, and we have to find a pluralist, and we have to find a pluralistic world in a pluralist,
in which the wisdom of all the popules can contribute to our well-being that is a collective.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some things I wrote in this book that I hope to recall other than you have heard and provery, I'll try to hear some collegments in case not notice us.
I want to start with what I call "the official dog.
The official dog, official dog,
The official dog, the official society industrial industrial industrial industrial societies, "If we want to massimizing the well-being of our citizing citizens."
The reason that is from one side, in the fact that liberty is in the fact that liberty is precious, useful for human beings.
On the other he's that if we are liber, each of us can act to do everything that massive to do anything that massive our well-being, without any one of our well-being, without any of our own well.
The way to massimizing liberty is to male is to male choice.
More choices people have the people -- the more is liberedos, and most of the freedom, is their being, and most of the well.
This is so deeply, it's so deeply that no one would dream of hold.
And it's also deeply radicated in our lives.
I'll show you some examples of what the progress has made possible.
This is my supermarket. This is not particularly large.
I allow me a simple named ed sound for inhealth instead.
In my supermarket there are 175 conditions, without content to the 10 varieties of oils and 12 acets across the balsamic of the bamic bamic conditions, you can have a huge number of conditions, the circumstance that nobody of the 175 already already already already yourdiments is to your degree.
That's the supermarket.
And then you go to the snegotio of electronic to buy a stereo, CD, radio Britain, printer charge.
And in this single snegotio of electronic components of audio components.
We can do six million and a half million different combinations using the components that there are in one negotid.
You have to admit that there's lots of choice.
Other camp: the world of communications.
One times, when I was a child, they could get all the service telephone that they could get all the service telephone that they were fornititited by mam.
He read the phone -- you didn't buy it out.
One consequence of this, it was that the phone doesn't rop.
These are the day's day.
Now we have a variety of phone almost list, especially in the cellphones.
Here's the cellphones of the future.
My favorite is the middle, MP3, the MP3, cutting the nose's burns for the bule.
If you don't have seen in the negotid of the substituts under the house, you're going to get revert.
And what the end happens is that people go into the negozes and does this question. And you know what is the answer? The answer is "No."
It's not possible to buy a cell that doesn't do too much things.
So, in other aspects of life that are much more important than the water of the same explosion.
Assistance, health is: not happens in the United States you go from the doctor, and the doctor, the doctor.
Instead, you go to the doctor, and the doctor, "Okay, we could do A, or B" "A, you can do this" "B" is these risks," "B" is these goods?"
You say, "Dr, what would I do?"
And the doctor, "As these goods, and these risks, and BBs has these risk."
"What's going to do you want to do?"
And you rebak it was what to do?"
And the doctor, "But I'm not le."
The result we call it the "autonomy of malato," expression that it seems to be a great thing.
But in fact, it's not that one to make the fish and the responsibility to make someone who knows what it knows s that nothing that you know anything -- and that doesn't know anything -- and so in not -- and so in not -- and so in not in the ideal conditional conditional decision,
There is a huge marketing products drugs, I would say people like me and you -- if you think of us think, and if you think he's not making them, you know, you don't buy them.
But if we can't buy them, because if you public them?
The answer is that they want doctor, we call the doctor, we call to ask the recip.
Something so foundation as we have to be a choice, as you see in this view in this view of the points of the inner "We don't want to force their sex sex sex sex to the right moment of the right now.
And we can reinvent, how many times we agree to us.
That means that every morning, you have to decide to decide that you want to decide that kind of person wants.
Rember at the family and the marriage, a time prospective -- under to anyone for anyone for anyone for anyone where, it was that you can get the pretty possible, and he started the pretty possible.
The only choice was choice was with choice was with choice what to do later.
Today, everything is really to play.
I mean, very smart students, and I think about 20 percent of less work than a time.
And not because they're brilliant, not because they're less diligent.
but why I'm impensiers, I mean to ask I said, "I should get to do it now?" I should do it now?"
"I should get a little bit late? I had to think before the children or career.
They're interrogative interrogatives --
And they try to answer these questions, even if this implicity doesn't completely completely to make a bunch of your exam.
And they have to really do that. They're important.
Now, the work: we're lucky, like Carl arl technology allows us to work every day, because technology allows us to work every day, from the planet, trans that from Hotel Randolph.
To parentess, there's a angle, and I'm not going to tell anybody where, where the WiFi work.
I don't say that I want to use it.
What does that mean that incredible freedom that we have about to work on the work? Is that we have to decide, and in every moment, if we have to work or not.
We can go to see our boy playing the brow with the cell in a task, Blackberry in the other, and the notebooks, on the knes.
And even though I'm all suspects, every minutes that we see our son to break the game parent, we are also ask?"
"I have to get this email? I got to hold this letter?"
And even when the answer is "us," this makes the experience of your child very different from what would be in other conditions.
So, anywhere in the same, things little and big materials and big materials and big materials and stily life, life is a question.
Once the world was this: Of course, there were some possibilities, but it was not a choice.
The world today is like this, the world today is the "Ilem, or negative now?"
The answer is Sholds there.
The positive side of the positive side of them all over the negative snegative here.
This is a choice of choice two negative effects on the people.
The first one is that the paradoxy, is produces instead of record that liberation.
And so many options that you choose that you choose becomes very difficult to do it.
I offer an example meaning, "an example of the conductarian ext of floors of floors.
A college had access to the data of the Vancers, the gants of though, with about a million hundred clients in 2,000 different companies.
What she found is that for every 10 solutions that every 10 solutions that are offered in the floor, the percent.
With 50 sources there is 10 percent less than the less of less than it only 5. Why?
Because with 50 sources that chooks is malezed, and choice, is a detailed to decide and choices is remained to question.
And the question, and the questions, question, question, and of course, won't be making, of course, it doesn't get the down.
You know, you know that these are not only that these workers will eat food for canoes because they don't have enough money, they don't have money, means that decision is so ostic that decision is so ostic that they have the founds of complementary of the data of work.
They don't participand they're losing until for 5000-dollar data from the data of work, who would be well to the test to the them.
So the paralysis is a consequence of having too many choices.
And I think that makes the world like this.
"And finally, for ethen, for ethis: "ketchup, or major maion?"
You would just take the right decision, if it's for ethnity, right?
You don't want to choose the bottom of wrong and the wrong, and neps the wrong.
So this is the first effect. The second is that even though we can avoid the paralysis, we end up to the end of the result as we were being able to be able to be able to be able to fly with less options of the choices.
And this for different reasons.
One of these is that with a lot of conditions, which is a choose, and it's not perfect, is easy to imagine that you could have a different choices that would be better than it would be better at it. And that what happens is that the alternative imagined us to the imagine, and the remains of choice, and the myth, and the remainly decling with the record of the pressure,
even when it was a very good decision.
More choices us that, the more is easier to dispiece of any details that is insoddisor, of the choice.
Also, there's what economists call the expensive opportunity.
Dan Gilbert asks, as a very well stamacine as the value that we do with the things we confront with it.
You know, when there are many options, is so easy to represent the careistics of the alternative features of the options of the options of the options of the options of the option.
Here's an example. I used with all the ones that I'm not New York.
But that's what you probably think we would think of it.
There's this coum to Hamptons.
A place of lus.
Spid day. It's all about splendid.
Nothing not equivalent to the thinking, "Well, the males," is Augustop it."
"All my neighbors in Manhattan are vie."
"I could talk about it right in front of home."
And it turns out to two weeks assilled by the idea that is losing -- the chance of parking where you want.
The expensive opportunities the soddisftion to what we have, even when the choice was excellent.
And the more are the options that we have to consider the most of characteristics will return us out to be expensive as a cost-opportunity.
Here's another example.
This view says a lot of things.
We talk about the time the live moment, and maybe living slow.
But the most important point is that anything you choose you choices you choose not do others.
The things we don't choose have a lot of factive that can make less atter what we do.
Tero point: growing spiral expectancy.
I tried to my skin buying a new jeans.
I was almost always jeans.
Once jeans were one of a type, buying them and cloth, they were brought to bestia, they were brought to a lot of life, and they had a lot of times, they started to go well.
So, I went to buy a new time when the old old old were when the old old were went to and said, "I need a couple of jeans, this is my cute."
The committed said, "You want you to slim fit, asy and phite?"
Would you like it means with the bottons or the bottons "Stones" or ""Would you like "?
"Li wants the road?"
"Soth you want them to be, or stretch, you know, the blahe's elense." He was elense to elense.
I was sbordy; I was a little bit of a jeans -- "I want the only guys -- that it was the only guy -- I was so so so I tried to all of the easy eans, and then I tried to all of the disease of jeans who had ever been able to say, "I want to have a couple of jeans that I had ever had.
It was the myself. I had the choice had had the best hold.
But I felt worse.
Why? I wrote a book to understand it.
The reason I was worse for the whole thing is that I was all that choice were very high choice were altish altish -- the jeans had to be perfects.
I had expecttminimes. I didn't expected, I didn't expected, when it only existed a guy, but when you see 100 different kinds of course, a guys had to be perfect.
What I had water was good ones, but not perfect.
After I had paragoned what I was trying to get to confront with what I was trying to confront to confront to waiting for waits.
The add of options in life of people do not forget the expectations that these have respects of the excellence.
And this will produce less soddisftion, even when the results are good ones.
No one in the world of marketing in the world of the world of it.
Because if you know it, you don't know what I'm talking about.
The truty assumch looks more like this.
"He was better when it was worss," he was worse. The reason he was worse. And he was worsse.
Today, in the world in which we live -- opulent, industrialized with the expectancy -- the massive we can hope is that we can hope is that things are at the height of way.
You never have any surprised because your expectances, my waits, my waits, and ingant.
The secret of happiness -- what you're here -- is "Baspectances."
I mean, little time authobiographic moment -- which I'm really married and my wife is really unbelieve.
I didn't have any better, I don't have any better, I don't have to do anything.
But I don't always have a bad thing.
And finally, a consequence of buying a couple of jeans is that when there is only that kind of jeans is that when you don't know "Why are you now, "Why?"
"Who is responsible answers?" "Who is clear.
The world is responsible. What would I do about that?
When there are hundreds of jeans, and you buy a insustain, and you ask you who is responsible to you who is responsible you to be as a responsible you are now.
You could do better.
With hundreds of varieties available for insuccess.
So when people take decision, even if the result is valid, they feel insatisfaces and they make the satisface to their own own own own own own own own own own own own own own there.
In the last years the depression is explose in the industrialized world.
I think that a fact meaning -- not the unique, but it's important -- not the unique, but -- of this depression is just that people have deluds' deluds' standard are too high.
And when they have to explain this situation think, that the cope is them.
So the final result is that we are better, objectively but we feel that we feel that we feel that we feel worse.
Let me tell you that.
This is the official dog, what we all take for good and it's completely false. It's really fail.
There is no two-bought that a little bit better than I have no choices that I don't have a lot better than a lot of choice, a little bit better than a bunch of a bunch of it.
There's a critic, magic value -- I don't know what it is.
But I'm sure we have super-hased by a piece that we have been a piece of the level that choices are our lives.
Now, from the political point -- I have almost finished -- from the view of the view is the follow.
What it allows you all this choice in the industrial industrial society is the material is the material recheese.
There are many places in the world, and you know about it, and you know that the problem is not that have too much choice.
The problem is that they have too population.
So the face that I'm talking about is a bad being a bad bad of modern, recidental societies.
And what it does depressing and arrablear is this: Steve Levitt you talked about how the expensive and comfortune sprecent for bibles are useful. It's a spreken indeed to you.
I mean, these choices, complicated and dispendous, it's not just useful, it's just inuseful.
They're deleteries.
They make worse.
If a little bit of what our society allows a lot of choice was reversed in those where people have too population too population is not only their life to improve but also now.
This is what economists call a better paretian.
One ridicated redent is doing well well -- not only to poor -- not only to poor -- because of this choice in except that back to us.
And he said, "Fole, you can become everything you want, "--
You know, culture, you think, "What does that fish is what about weight is?"
"It's obvious that you can't do anything in a mouth of glass of glass of glass.
"As a fall, a view of the world."
and I mean I had interpreted this on the beginning.
But then, I thought that weight on that fish is that fish the long way that fish is that fish the long sh.
Because the reality of the facts is that if you sent your franks, so that "everything is possible," you can't get freedom. You get the paralysis.
If you rop the mouth of the way that it becomes possible to be decluster defation.
You can get the paralysis, and you reduce the well.
Everyone needs to be a sphere.
This is almost certainly too strectch, perhaps even for us.
But the absence of some symbolic symbolic symbolic and temption, for room roll.
Thank you very much.
