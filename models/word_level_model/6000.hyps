<unk> year, I showed these <unk> to <unk> that the <unk> <unk> <unk>, which is about three million years of the United States, <unk> <unk>, <unk> is <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>
And I'm going to <unk> the <unk> of the problem because it's not <unk> the ice.
<unk> <unk> <unk> is, in a sense, the heart of the <unk> of the climate change.
It's <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
The next next <unk> is going to be a <unk> <unk> <unk> on the last 25 years.
<unk> <unk> are <unk> in red.
As you see, you see it, you know, you know, you know, you know, you see it, as you see, you see, as you see, you see, as you see, as you see, you see it, as you see, you see, as you see
That's the ice in <unk>, which <unk> <unk> of summer.
You can see that the <unk> ice <unk>, of five years, it's like the blood, which here is the body.
<unk> 25 years, it's been <unk>, so.
This is a problem because the <unk> are <unk> in the <unk> <unk> around the ocean <unk> where there are enormous amount of <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, are <unk> in the <unk>.
<unk> at the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, that could <unk>, <unk> this <unk> <unk>, <unk> this point of not <unk>.
In some <unk>, I was <unk> in the <unk> <unk> is already <unk> from water.
The <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>, <unk> with a team <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>! <unk>: She's good. The question is it's good. The question is if you also.
One is that this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk>.
This is a river in <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> had never <unk> <unk> levels.
This is the <unk> <unk>, in the <unk> of the <unk>.
If you want to know how it's the level of the sea level of the <unk> <unk>, here is where the sea sea sea.
These <unk> are <unk> <unk>.
<unk> other side of the planet: <unk>, the largest <unk> of ice <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, <unk> scientists who <unk> the <unk> of the ice is in <unk>, and the <unk> <unk>, which <unk> on some <unk> <unk>, is particularly <unk> in the <unk>.
<unk> to six feet of the <unk>, like in <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, the third largest <unk> of ice, you see new <unk>, which is <unk>, a few years ago.
The 40 percent of the world population <unk> half of the water <unk> of the <unk> of that <unk>.
<unk> <unk>: This <unk> is the source of water <unk> of this city.
The <unk> is <unk>.
But when you <unk>, the same happens to water.
In California, <unk> <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> of 40 percent.
<unk> <unk> are in the crisis.
<unk>, as you're <unk>, they're <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> in the world to a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> are <unk> to a <unk> outside of the normal and without <unk>.
<unk> times more <unk> in the last 30 years, as the <unk> <unk>.
This is a <unk> of all.
If you look at the context context of the context of the context of it.
In the last five years, we have <unk> 70 million <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> in the ocean every day.
Look at the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, from <unk>, to <unk>, and on both parts of the <unk> <unk>, where there's a <unk> <unk> of oxygen in the ocean.
The most of the global <unk>, with <unk>, which is 20 percent, is the use of <unk> <unk>.
The oil is a problem, and the <unk> is even worse.
The United States are one of the two countries with more <unk> emissions, together.
And they were <unk> to build a lot of other <unk>.
But we're <unk> to a <unk> of direction.
These are the <unk> projects in the last years and some of the <unk> <unk>.
In every way, there's a <unk> <unk> in our country.
The <unk> of <unk> and oil <unk> <unk> <unk> million dollars in the last year to <unk> the <unk> <unk>, which is a <unk>.
I <unk> image to me something --
<unk> <unk>, in the <unk>, where I live, there was a <unk> of <unk> billion <unk> <unk>.
Maybe you've seen it on the <unk>.
This is the second <unk> of <unk> in America.
It's happened around <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> of one of the <unk> was this.
<unk>: <unk> <unk> the <unk> is a <unk> <unk> and happy.
It's <unk> here in America, and it's to grow our economy.
<unk> the <unk> is always <unk>.
It's <unk>, <unk>, <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> here is a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The largest <unk> society <unk> is <unk> <unk>. This is his <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- Al <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> -- not know what they're talking about.
<unk>: So the <unk> for the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>.
This is a one of them, a part.
<unk>: <unk>: <unk> we see the changes as a <unk> <unk> <unk> in our business.
So, our <unk> is <unk> a big amount of money in a <unk> <unk> to make <unk> and public truth on the <unk>.
In fact, the <unk> is not <unk>.
We think it's <unk> -- also also a good <unk>.
So we don't <unk> the climate change.
We're going to do it.
<unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk> -- you've heard about a lot.
So I <unk> a around a <unk> structure of <unk> as much as <unk> <unk>.
<unk>! The machines are a little <unk>, but this is the sound of the technology of <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> is between the <unk> of global warming, but the <unk> technology of <unk>, but the <unk> technology of <unk> that you see it.
<unk> a look: this is the <unk> technology of <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the national <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> America is in the crisis; the economy, the <unk> of national <unk>, the crisis.
The <unk> that <unk> all: our <unk> <unk> <unk>, like the <unk> <unk> and oil <unk>.
Now, there's a new, <unk> solution to <unk>.
<unk> America: 100 percent of energy, in 10 years.
A plan for <unk> America to work, <unk> more <unk>, and to help <unk> the global warming.
<unk>, a solution that we're going to solve our problems.
<unk> America. <unk> of more.
<unk>: This is the last.
<unk>: <unk>: It's about <unk> energy to America.
One of the most ways of <unk> <unk>, to the <unk> <unk> that we <unk> our planet.

<unk>: <unk> America. It's time to be <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk> says, "If you want to go to <unk>, you go from.
If you want to go, you go to the <unk>. "
We have to go far, fast.
Thank you very much.
<unk> year, I did an <unk> <unk> on the <unk>.
And I was <unk> to <unk> on how it works.
So, there. And for those who were the other time, there were, the <unk> is the largest <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> is about <unk> the conditions that were <unk> less than a <unk> of a second from the <unk> of the universe -- to <unk> million times a second.
That's just <unk>.
This is the car under <unk>.
And these <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk>.
This is what I work. It's called <unk> -- it's <unk> <unk>. It's <unk> feet and has a <unk> of <unk>.
This is an <unk> image of <unk> in the building so you can see the <unk>.
The 10 <unk> of the last year we <unk> the car for the first time.
And this picture was <unk> by <unk>.
It was <unk> <unk> in the room of control.
It's an image of the first <unk> of particles that had done all the around the <unk> of the <unk>, <unk>, with a part of the <unk>, and <unk> particles in the <unk>.
In other words, when I <unk> that image the 10 <unk>, <unk> that the car, the <unk>, which is a big <unk>.
I don't know if it was this to <unk> us more or this, when somebody <unk> on Google and <unk> that the page was this.
What means we have had a <unk> impact on the scientific impact.
<unk> a week later, there was a problem with the car, it had to just these <unk> here -- these <unk> <unk> <unk>.
These <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> when the car works in the <unk> of the <unk>.
Now, the <unk> between you <unk> the <unk> and <unk>, "it's not true. I'm too too <unk>."
And they can do it because when they're very <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
So, in less <unk> degrees, at a temperature temperature temperature <unk> at that the stars, these <unk> can bring that <unk>.
In one of the <unk> between the most of the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>, there was a <unk> of <unk>.
So the <unk> <unk> <unk>, and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk>.
This was the result.
Now, this is more <unk> if you think that these <unk> <unk> <unk> more than 20 <unk>, and that's <unk> about 30 <unk>.
It's <unk> about 50 <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, what we did.
We have <unk> them and <unk>.
We're all <unk> to their <unk> place.
<unk> the end of <unk> the <unk> will be <unk> again.
<unk> it, and we <unk> to get the data to <unk> or <unk>, and <unk> our <unk> to find out what the <unk> are the <unk> that are <unk> that <unk> the universe.
Now, of course, in a certain thing, these <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> of science and <unk>.
I think that's what it's so hard, the fact of, I think it's the value of things like <unk>.
I'd like to <unk> with the words of a <unk> <unk> <unk>, which, in <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, his <unk> was <unk>, and he said, "No," <unk>, he said, "It's not a <unk> for the <unk> of the human mind that the <unk> of science are <unk>, that there are not <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk>, and <unk> <unk>.
Thank you.
I want to start to <unk> when, from children, from children, <unk>.
<unk> <unk> as <unk> and <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> to the way we <unk> the world around us.
So, from <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of our <unk> with objects, and I <unk> <unk> <unk>, and my <unk> <unk> <unk>, and I started <unk>, and I started <unk>, and I started <unk>, when we use a computer, instead of <unk>, instead of <unk>, and the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> like a <unk>, with the hands of the hands of the hands of <unk>,
and we <unk> our <unk>?
The question was so interesting that we could explore the answer, building the answer, building the answer,
In a few words, a <unk> is a computer <unk> like a <unk>.
In a few words, a <unk> is a computer <unk> like a <unk>.
You can <unk> them with your hand, they can <unk> them, and they can see the <unk>, and they have a radio <unk>.
But <unk>, they're <unk>, like <unk>, you can <unk> them.
The <unk> is the example of a new <unk> of tools to <unk> the digital information.
And as as as much <unk>, <unk> of the movement, of the other, and <unk> that become more <unk>, <unk> of the <unk>, of the <unk>, of the <unk>, of how we can <unk> them, and we can <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's <unk> with some simple example.
This <unk> is <unk> to show you. <unk> it in a direction, the video <unk>, the video <unk> <unk>, if you go from the other <unk>.
These <unk> <unk> are <unk> of other.
If you <unk> them, you know what it's going around.
If they're <unk>, you can <unk> it, you can <unk> a little.
If they're <unk>, you can <unk> it, you can <unk> a little.
<unk> their movement and <unk>.
We were <unk> that one of the interesting <unk> of the <unk> was the <unk> of the data, to be able to use <unk> in the data, and example, "<unk> a <unk> of the <unk>.
In this case, we have three <unk> <unk> as <unk> of <unk> and I can <unk> to <unk> the color of the <unk> in the <unk>, where you get it.
and I can <unk> for <unk> in the <unk> of the color of the central, where you get.
If you're <unk> too, we can <unk> a little bit.
I also <unk> to <unk> <unk>, like <unk>, <unk>, the mathematics and games where people can try things things, and <unk> the <unk> <unk>.
Now, I'm --
This is a sequence of <unk> that I do with a program of <unk>.
Here we have a <unk> of words that is to half between <unk> and <unk>.
<unk>, at every <unk> <unk> a letter at every <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, to every <unk> <unk> a letter to <unk> a letter in every <unk>, and as <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> him.
And then, after about 30 seconds, and you have a new <unk> of <unk> and new <unk> <unk>.
Thank you.
Here's here, the children <unk> in <unk> <unk>, I did in the way that we <unk> them and I <unk> a video.
They're <unk> very <unk>.
And one of the interesting things of this <unk> is that you don't have to give people a lot of <unk>.
I just say, "<unk> of the words," and they know exactly what to do.
Here's there there's other people who <unk>.
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk>, there's our <unk> <unk>.
It's actually wanted to <unk>.
They were just <unk>, for him.
Now, this is an <unk> of a <unk> <unk>.
<unk> building a tool for the <unk> of the <unk>. He's <unk>.
It can <unk> new characters in the <unk>, <unk> their <unk> <unk>.
It can <unk> new characters in the <unk>, <unk> their <unk> <unk>.
Here's, it's doing the sun.
<unk>: The sun is <unk>.
<unk> <unk>: Now he <unk> a <unk> in the <unk>.
<unk>: The <unk> <unk>.
<unk> work!
So, <unk> the <unk> and <unk> can <unk> the characters --
<unk>: <unk>!
<unk> your story.
<unk>: <unk>!
<unk>: It's a story with the final <unk>, and you can understand him how it <unk>.
<unk>: It's a story with the final <unk>, and you can understand him how it <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>, <unk>.
<unk>: The last example, I'm going to show you is a <unk>, and I've been <unk>, for <unk> and music.
It's a tool, made of recent <unk>, to <unk> and music.
The <unk> here is <unk> by <unk> like, <unk>, <unk>.
<unk> of these has four <unk>, and you can <unk> what use.
You can also <unk> these <unk> in a sequence from <unk> to your <unk>.
And I would just <unk> a sound of <unk> a sound, "and a <unk>."
These are actually that you can control from the live, like the <unk> and the <unk>.
I <unk> it at a particular sound and then <unk> to <unk>.
And then there are the <unk> of the fact, as long as time and <unk>, which <unk> to the entire sequence.
It's like it works.
<unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> in two <unk> <unk>. "<unk>, the <unk> in a series, the <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
Now, let's go to a line.
<unk>: <unk> <unk>: <unk> of the <unk> --
<unk>: <unk>: And now we <unk> the <unk> <unk>, so I can control the effect of the <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>: I can <unk> the entire <unk> <unk> the time from one, or the other.
<unk>: <unk>: And now we <unk> the <unk> <unk> to <unk> more <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>: I can <unk> the sequence of the <unk>.
So I don't have to <unk> before, but I can <unk>, <unk> more or more <unk>.
And now, I can <unk> the entire <unk> <unk> on the left left the <unk> <unk>. "
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is building new <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, more <unk> <unk> to how they work.
And today, I had time to show you one of this <unk>, and also some <unk> of this <unk>, and some possibility that we try to get out of the lab.
So, the concept I want to <unk> is that it's <unk> this new generation of <unk> objects, which <unk> information in our world world world in our way that we want.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the time to talk with all of you.
It's a <unk>.
<unk> books is my <unk>, but it's more than this, of course.
It's also love and the <unk> of my life.
And I don't think that can change.
But, I said, something particular is happened in my life and my career, and my career, who <unk> me to <unk> the whole <unk> with this work.
The particular thing is that I wrote this book, this <unk> called "<unk>," <unk>, "<unk>," which, "<unk>," which, "<unk>," <unk>, "<unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And the result is that <unk> everywhere, people <unk> me like I was if I was <unk>.
<unk> -- <unk>, <unk>!
I'll <unk> to me all <unk> and they say, "You don't have fear of no longer <unk>?
You have no fear of <unk> life without more than to be able to create a book that can <unk> to somebody? "
that can <unk> somebody? "
It's <unk>, you know.
But it could go worse, I remember that more than 20 years ago, when I <unk> to say, I was a <unk> -- I'd like to be a <unk>.
I <unk> to <unk> the same <unk> <unk>.
And people said, "Don't <unk> to me," <unk>'t <unk> to have success?
You have no fear of the <unk> of the <unk> you <unk>?
You have no fear of this <unk> for all life without nothing to be out and <unk> on a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>? "
So, you know.
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is, "Yes."
And I'm fear of all those things.
I always had fear.
And I also fear of a lot of other things that people can't be <unk>.
As the <unk> and other things.
But, to say, I thought about what I thought and I thought about it is why?
Is it <unk>?
It's <unk> that anyone who were <unk> to be <unk> by a job that you feel <unk> to do.
But what's so particular in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> about <unk> <unk> in a way that other <unk>'t do it?
How my father, for example, he was a <unk> <unk> <unk> and I didn't remember one time in his 40 years, in the 40 years of the <unk> that the <unk> was asked?
There was never -- that <unk> of the <unk> of John <unk>, how do it?
<unk>'t <unk> that, <unk>?
<unk>, the engineers like the <unk> of <unk>, in the <unk>, <unk>, <unk> the <unk> of being <unk> <unk>.
We <unk>, we have enough enough that <unk>, and not only only <unk>, but we're <unk> of all this <unk> of being <unk> <unk>.
And not else that we're not going to look at the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that, in the <unk> century, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> and often.
And even those who don't seem to be <unk> by their <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, before he was <unk>, in the last <unk> said, "Every <unk> my book, he <unk> me a little more <unk> about the work of their life.
But I didn't <unk> it when we've heard of these things so long in a few <unk>, we have completely <unk> and <unk> the <unk> that creativity and <unk>, and the <unk> of the art, to the end, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
And the question I want to <unk> to all here today is, you're with this idea?
It's good for you, because it's also <unk> by a <unk> of <unk>, <unk> from a <unk> of <unk>.
I think it's <unk>.
And I think it's also <unk> and I don't want to <unk> <unk> in the next century.
I think it's better <unk> our big <unk> <unk> to live.
And I know, in my case -- in my case -- it would be very <unk> to start <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in which I have in my career.
<unk> -- <unk> -- look at it, I'm pretty young, I've been about 40 years.
I still about four <unk> of work in me.
And it's very <unk> that anything that we're going to be <unk> from the world like the work that I <unk> after the <unk> of my last book.
<unk> <unk>, because we're all all about the <unk>, it's <unk> that my greatest <unk> is to my <unk>.
Oh, <unk>, <unk>, who thought!
You know, this is the kind of thought that brings a person to <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> to the <unk> <unk> to the <unk> <unk> <unk> to the <unk> <unk> in the morning and I don't want to do it.
I'll continue to do this work that I love.
So, the question becomes, how?
And so it seems to me, after many <unk>, that the way to work to write, and what to create a <unk> <unk> <unk>, right?
I have to have to find a <unk> distance between me, and my natural <unk> that I'm <unk>, and my natural <unk> that wrote about what <unk> <unk> <unk> to get to <unk>, and as we <unk> to <unk> the time, looking at the time, looking at the time, looking at other society to see if we have more <unk> and <unk>.
about how to help people <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity.
And that research <unk> me to <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
<unk> because it <unk> in <unk> and then <unk> back.
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> -- people don't believe that that <unk> creativity of the men, OK?
And they <unk> that creativity was this spirit <unk> <unk> and <unk> to men from some <unk> <unk> and <unk>, for <unk> <unk>, for <unk> <unk>, for <unk> <unk>, for <unk>.
<unk> <unk> these <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity. "
<unk>, <unk>, <unk> of <unk>, <unk> to have a <unk> that <unk> <unk> from from <unk>.
The <unk> of the same idea, but we <unk> that species of the spirit without a <unk>.
The <unk> <unk>, because the <unk> <unk> doesn't really really really <unk> that a <unk> was somebody particularly <unk>.
<unk> that a <unk> was this kind of <unk> of <unk> <unk> that work.
<unk> <unk> here, is the distance of the distance of the <unk> of the <unk> of your work.
And all of <unk> that was that <unk>, right?
So, <unk> artists were <unk> by <unk> things, like, for example, too much <unk>, not?
If your work was <unk> not <unk> <unk> all the <unk>, all of <unk> that <unk> was <unk> by this <unk> <unk>.
If your work <unk> work, it wasn't all all your <unk>, right?
And they all <unk> that was your <unk> to be a <unk>.
And so people <unk> <unk> creativity in <unk> for a long time.
And then the <unk> <unk> and all <unk> this big idea; we put the human <unk> in the <unk> of the universe, the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk>.
This was the principle of the <unk> and people who are <unk> to think that <unk> creativity.
And for the first time in history, you <unk> to <unk> this or that artist as a <unk> <unk>, as a <unk> <unk>.
And I have to <unk>, I think it was a big <unk>.
I think that I would <unk> to someone, a simple person to believe that they're like a <unk>, <unk> and <unk> of all the <unk> <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, <unk> and <unk> and <unk> a responsibility a <unk> too much as much as much as the human <unk>.
It's like to ask someone of <unk> the sun.
<unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> all these <unk> <unk> and <unk> all these <unk> <unk> on the <unk>.
And I think it was this pressure pressure to <unk> the artists in 500 years.
And, if this is true, and I think that is, the question becomes, and I'm going to be, and now?
Can we do it?
<unk> to go back to a more <unk> of the relationship between human relationship between human <unk> and <unk>.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we can't <unk> 500 years of thinking in a <unk> talk about 18 minutes.
And there's probably people in the audience that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk>, you know that <unk> people <unk> <unk> <unk> on their projects.
You probably don't <unk> you all about this thing.
But the question I'd like to <unk> is -- why not?
Why don't we <unk> it in this way?
Because it has more than any other thing that has ever heard about to explain the <unk> of the <unk> process.
One process that, as anyone who ever ever <unk> to do something -- so, <unk>, all here -- it's not <unk>.
And in fact, in fact, it can <unk>.
I made this <unk> with the extraordinary <unk> <unk> <unk>, who has been <unk> in the <unk> <unk>, but it was a <unk> for all life and <unk> me that during his <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> out in the <unk> <unk>, <unk> out in the <unk> <unk>.
He said that was like a <unk> <unk>.
And that <unk> <unk> to her from the <unk>.
I <unk> it, because he was <unk> the ground under his feet.
And I was to have one thing to do that, and it was, words, and he was a <unk>. "
And I was <unk> to the house and they were <unk> from this <unk>, and it didn't have to take another that I had a piece of paper and a <unk> enough enough, as the <unk>, <unk> and <unk> on the page.
<unk> times, they didn't get enough, so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> the <unk> <unk> through the <unk> and she would <unk> it through the <unk> and she would <unk> to <unk> through the <unk>, looking at the <unk>, and he said, "another <unk>."
And there were those times -- this is not <unk>.
So, was <unk> to the house and he was trying to <unk> the <unk> through, and <unk> a <unk> <unk> in the <unk>, and he was that was like if you <unk> with the other hand and the hand and the <unk>.
<unk> the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> in his body and the <unk> on the page.
And in these cases, the <unk> would be <unk> on the <unk> page and <unk>, but the last word to the first.
So when I <unk> <unk> -- it's <unk>, it's exactly <unk> to my <unk> process.
Not all my <unk> process -- I'm not a <unk> <unk>.
I'm a <unk>, and my way of <unk> is; it <unk> at the same <unk> every day and <unk> and <unk> on the <unk>.
But even I was, in my <unk>, I <unk> against that what, sometimes.
And I think that many of you have <unk>.
You know, even though work and the ideas I could <unk> me from a certain source of <unk>.
And what is this thing?
And how can we <unk> it to it in a way that we don't <unk> the head, but, rather, what do we <unk> us?
So, as I'm about the best example, I've got the <unk> <unk>, which I've been <unk> different years ago for a <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, <unk>, you know, <unk>, for the <unk> of life was the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, trying to control, <unk> these <unk> species of <unk> <unk>, <unk> these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
But then <unk>, <unk>, and a day as I was <unk> on a <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> all for him.
I'll be <unk> and all of a <unk> <unk> that's <unk> of <unk>, which comes in in its head as <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, you know, it's wonderful, and the <unk>, but it's not how to <unk>.
It's not a piece of paper, he doesn't have a <unk>,
So, I start to feel this kind of old old <unk> to <unk> in him, "I'm for <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk> from this song.
I'm not <unk> enough enough and I can't <unk>. "
And instead of go in the <unk>, they <unk>.
<unk> the entire <unk> process and made something again.
He just <unk> the sky and said, "<unk>, you don't see I'm <unk>?"
"You know, you can write a song?
If you really want to <unk>, you'll <unk> in a more <unk> when I can <unk> care of you.
<unk>, <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk>. "
And his <unk> process after this.
I didn't work, the work was still <unk> as always.
But the process, and the <unk> <unk> that was <unk> when the <unk>, the <unk> that was <unk> when the <unk>, the <unk> that's <unk> <unk>, and we had to <unk> it back from, where it was <unk> that it had to be a <unk> and <unk>.
But I <unk> this <unk>, wonderful <unk> <unk> <unk> a conversation between <unk> and this <unk> and this <unk> and this <unk> and this <unk> and this <unk> and this <unk> and this <unk>, and it wasn't <unk>.
So, how I <unk> that story to change a little bit of the way that I <unk> and I've already <unk> me.
This idea, I was <unk>, I was <unk>, "<unk>," and <unk>, "and <unk> in one of the <unk> of the <unk> in which we're working on something and we're working on something and we can be a <unk>, and we can think that's going to be a <unk> <unk>, and that will be a <unk> book.
Not only <unk>, just <unk> the <unk> book.
And I <unk> to think about <unk> this project.
But then I <unk> to me that <unk> to the air and <unk>.
So I <unk> my face on the <unk> and <unk> my <unk> to the <unk> and <unk> my <unk> to the room.
And I said to high <unk>, "<unk>, what, both we know that if this book will not be <unk> <unk>. <unk> is not going to be <unk> my, no?
Because you see I'm <unk> all that I have, I don't have more than this.
So if you want to be better, you have to <unk> and do your part.
OK. But if you don't do it, you know, you know, I don't have anything.
I'll write the same because it's my work.
And I'd like to say that it was <unk> that I'd <unk> to do my part. "Because -- I'm going to be <unk> in the <unk> of the North Africa of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the moon, and <unk> music that <unk> <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the moon, and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk>.
And they were always <unk>, because the <unk> were <unk> and <unk>.
But every <unk>, <unk>, something <unk>, and one of these artists are actually <unk>.
And I know, I talk about what I talk, because I know you've seen it all of it, a <unk> <unk>.
It was like if the time you <unk>, and the <unk> <unk> through a kind of <unk> and was <unk> with nothing else, as the <unk> <unk> <unk>, but everything <unk>.
And at all of a sudden, not only as a human.
But it <unk> from the <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk>.
And when this <unk>, people who were <unk> what was, and people who were what was, I <unk> with her.
<unk> the hands and <unk> <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, God," God. "
That's God, you know.
<unk> <unk> -- when the <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk>, <unk> this <unk> with them and <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk>, "<unk>," <unk>, "<unk>," <unk>, "<unk>," <unk>, "<unk>," <unk>, "<unk>," <unk>, "<unk>," <unk>, "<unk>," <unk>, "<unk>," <unk>, "
In <unk>, when a artist has done something to <unk> and <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> -- <unk>, <unk> -- one of God.
And it's <unk> because we need.
But, the problem is the day after, for the <unk>, when you <unk> and <unk> that are the 11 of the <unk> and <unk> of God's not more.
It's just a <unk> with a <unk> <unk>, and maybe not <unk> that ever ever <unk> to <unk>.
And maybe nobody <unk> the name of God still as <unk>, and what's to do with the rest of his life?
It's hard.
This is one of the most <unk> <unk> to do in a life life.
But maybe it doesn't have to be so <unk> if you don't believe, <unk>, <unk>, that the most <unk> of your <unk> are from you.
But I just just that you're <unk> in <unk> from a <unk> source of this <unk> part of your life that you have to <unk>.
And, you know, if we think in this way.
And so I started <unk>, and it's what I <unk> for different months in the <unk> of the book that we'll be <unk>, the <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>,
And what I have to keep <unk> when I feel about this is, not <unk>.
<unk>. <unk> only your work.
<unk> to <unk> for your part, whatever.
If your work is <unk>, you know.
If the <unk>, you'll <unk> you to you <unk> <unk> <unk> some kind of <unk>, for a <unk> moment through your <unk>, then you're going to go to you <unk>, "<unk>!"
You're doing the same <unk>.
And I <unk>! "<unk>, you know, you know,
I think it's <unk>.
"<unk>!" <unk>, you know, even for the same, even for <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk>: <unk>!
You know, I've been talking about some of these projects on the human genome, on what can <unk> and <unk> of new <unk> of genes.
Now we're <unk> a new <unk>. We started to <unk> the biology and now to start from that digital code, and we're <unk> in a new <unk> of biology, <unk> and <unk> life.
We always have to <unk> <unk>.
"<unk> is the life?" It's something that many <unk> I think they have to understand them to understand <unk>.
We tried different <unk>, <unk> to the <unk>.
We're <unk> by almost 20 years.
When we <unk> the human genome <unk> <unk> to go from the world of biology in the digital world of the computer biology.
Now we <unk> us, we can <unk> life, or create new life from this digital universe?
This is the map of a little <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, which is the species from the most small between those that can <unk> in the lab.
And we tried to <unk> the genome to <unk> the genome to <unk> one one more <unk>.
We're able to <unk> a <unk> of <unk> about 500 <unk> that are here.
But when we're looking at its map, it's <unk> simple <unk>, it's <unk> simple than our.
<unk>, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can <unk>, one at the time, it's very <unk> that can bring a <unk> cell.
So, I thought the only <unk> <unk> was <unk> this <unk> in the way that we <unk> the <unk> to <unk> some of these questions.
And so we started the <unk> of the <unk>, "can we <unk> a <unk>?"
It's the <unk> chemistry of making these big molecules that we never have been able to create the first time?
And in case, we can do a <unk> <unk>?
A <unk> is just a piece of <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The speed that we're able to <unk> life.
Our ability to write the <unk> code, instead, instead, <unk>, but it's <unk>.
And our most <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk>.
We have more than 15 years ago.
The <unk> has <unk> a lot of <unk>, <unk> with a <unk> <unk> <unk> before <unk> the <unk> experiments.
But we found that that we <unk> of DNA is very hard.
There are <unk> of thousands of machines in the world that we're <unk> of DNA, <unk> of <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, more <unk>, more <unk>.
So we had to develop a new <unk> to <unk> these <unk> and <unk> the <unk>.
And this was our first <unk>, to start from the digital <unk> of the genome of the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's a little virus that <unk> bacteria.
We designed the <unk> <unk>, <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of DNA <unk> and <unk> a <unk> of DNA <unk>.
The interesting part is when we took this piece of <unk> material <unk> and we <unk> it in the bacteria, the bacteria have <unk> to read this code and <unk> the <unk> particles.
<unk> particles are <unk> by cells, they're <unk> by cells, they <unk> the <unk> <unk>.
I talked about the <unk> <unk> <unk> that they have certainly <unk> that they have certainly <unk>.
They <unk> more than you.
So, what this is a situation where software can actually build its same <unk> in a <unk> system.
But we're going to do things in big.
It <unk> to build the <unk> of the <unk>.
They're more than <unk> <unk> <unk>.
So we thought of <unk> in the size of the size of the <unk>, so that we can change the <unk> to understand what the <unk> of a <unk> cell.
The <unk> is <unk>, and if we <unk> with information in a computer, these have to be very <unk>.
When I <unk> this genome for the first time in the <unk> <unk> <unk> was about a <unk> for every 10 <unk> <unk>.
We found, <unk>, 30 <unk>. If we were used that original sequence that original sequence never had to do it.
One of the process is design <unk> 50 <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk>, which <unk> with all the other <unk> of 50 <unk> to build more small <unk> that <unk> together.
<unk> the <unk> here.
You probably have read that that we'll <unk> us.
<unk> <unk>: We have a <unk> <unk> <unk> on four <unk>: <unk>, <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> of those <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and there's a <unk> order to <unk> every <unk>.
So we can use the <unk> code for <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
What we did at the beginning was <unk>.
Some of the fact that it wasn't <unk>.
We designed these <unk> <unk> to <unk>.
There are <unk> that we <unk> them and <unk> them.
And we started <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
In every step, we've made these <unk> in <unk> so that we're <unk> to create a extremely <unk> <unk> <unk> as you see in a minute.
We're trying to <unk> the process.
So, this seems the <unk> of a <unk> of <unk>.
When we <unk> these <unk> very <unk>, more than 100 <unk> <unk>, not <unk> directly in the <unk> <unk>.
It's <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
So we have <unk> other <unk>.
And I'll <unk> to another <unk> called <unk> <unk>, which in biology <unk> to <unk> DNA.
Here's a example.
This <unk>, called <unk> <unk>, can <unk> three million <unk> of <unk>.
You can see in the <unk> as his <unk> <unk>.
In 12 24 hours, it's <unk> exactly as it was before.
<unk> thousands of organisms that are able to do it.
These organisms can <unk> completely <unk>.
It's <unk> <unk>.
They're absolutely sure that life in space, and you're <unk> to find new <unk> of water.
In fact, NASA has shown that this is.
This is an image of the <unk> that we built using these <unk>, just using the <unk> with the <unk> design of <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This image was not <unk> with a <unk> <unk>, but with a <unk> <unk>.
It's a <unk> <unk> that we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk>.
These are pictures that <unk> a time of about six seconds.
This is the <unk> that we did a little time ago.
They're more than <unk> <unk> code.
It's the most <unk> of a <unk> <unk> structure of a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's got a <unk> weight to 300 million.
If you <unk> it with a <unk> 10 <unk>, we'll <unk> <unk> pages for this <unk>.
Now, how do we do it? How can we <unk> it?
Of course, with a virus is a game of kids.
It's a little bit more <unk> when you use bacteria.
It's more simple when it's about cells as well, it's about cells, you can just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> another, which is almost the process of <unk>.
In <unk>, <unk> the <unk> is instead of <unk> in the cell, but we <unk> that we can do a <unk> <unk> of a <unk> <unk> from one <unk> from one cell to another and <unk>.
We have a <unk> <unk> <unk> from a <unk> species.
<unk> are the two different as the <unk> men.
We have <unk> some <unk> in more <unk> in the way that we could have to <unk>.
And it's <unk> with the <unk> in the <unk> in the way of all the <unk>.
And when we put it in the cell was <unk> and <unk> our <unk> <unk> the new <unk> <unk>.
And we were <unk> that we didn't go beyond, but we tried to <unk> more in there.
This is one of the <unk> of evolution.
We found that that <unk> species have <unk> a second or a third <unk> from some of the <unk>, <unk> in a second thousands of new <unk> in that species.
So who think about evolution as a <unk> only <unk> at the time, as a <unk> <unk> at the biology.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> that <unk> DNA.
The <unk> that was in the cell cell.
The <unk> <unk> that we <unk>.
It's <unk>, and he <unk> the other <unk> like <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and we <unk> with only the cell and the new <unk>.
It's become blue <unk> because of the genes we have <unk>.
And in a short <unk> of time, all of a <unk> of a kind of <unk>, and it's <unk> of all in the new <unk>, <unk> on the new software that we have <unk> in the cell.
All the <unk> are <unk>, the <unk> are <unk>, and when we <unk> the code <unk> <unk> exactly what we have to.
Now, this may be <unk> <unk>, but we can <unk> the software, we can change things in a way.
Now, I've already <unk> that there's not about <unk> -- but it's about <unk> -- but of progress to <unk> <unk>, and a half million years of evolution, and a new version of the <unk> <unk> in which we're <unk> <unk> new species of this <unk> <unk>.
Why do that?
I think it's enough to <unk> our <unk>.
We're going to go from six billion and a half billion people in the next 40 years.
<unk> for example, I was born in <unk>.
Now, there are three people on the planet to <unk> <unk> in the <unk>; there's four.
We're <unk> problems now to find food, water <unk> and <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, <unk> and a half billion people.
<unk> more <unk> to do that for nine billion.
<unk> more than five billion <unk>, more than 30 billion <unk> of <unk>.
That means percent of <unk> a day.
When we try to find <unk> <unk>, or any kind of process of <unk>, it's going to be a huge challenge.
In more we have to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of CO2 from these materials that <unk> in the atmosphere.
In the day of today, because of the <unk> <unk> <unk> in all the world, we have a <unk> with about 20 million genes, and I like to think that are the <unk> for the future.
The <unk> industry is only a <unk> of <unk>, and think about how many different things are <unk> out.
Our <unk> here are <unk> data from reality and our imagination.
We have <unk>, because of these <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk>, able to create what we call <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We're able to build a big robot that can produce a million <unk> a day.
Think of these 20 million genes, and we can <unk> the <unk> <unk> to produce <unk> or <unk>, new <unk>, we can change, because we can change, with a little team, and create more <unk> biology now that in the last 20 years of science.
And it's just a <unk> <unk>.
We can <unk> to <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This is an <unk> of some software software <unk> that we're working on to be able to <unk> and design species to the computer.
Well, we don't know how they will be.
We know exactly exactly how their <unk> code.
We're <unk> on the <unk> of <unk> generation.
You've seen that <unk> <unk> from the <unk> was a <unk> experiment.
We have <unk> <unk> <unk>, and the third generation that we're going to be <unk> as as the <unk> or different kinds of <unk>.
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without <unk> the cost of the food and <unk> the <unk> would be <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> in the matter of the <unk> that we're working for the first <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk>, and we're working for the first <unk> of <unk> <unk> in the next generation.
The solar <unk> <unk> with the CO2 is a <unk>, but in our <unk> in the <unk>, we found different <unk>.
This is a <unk> that we <unk> in the <unk>.
<unk> in the ocean, about <unk> feet of <unk> <unk> at the temperature of water.
<unk> <unk> <unk> using hydrogen <unk> as the <unk> of energy.
We're trying to understand if we can <unk> the CO2 CO2, that can easily be <unk> by <unk>, to <unk> that CO2 in <unk>, to <unk> this process.
So, we think that we could be able to be able to <unk> what the question of "that what is life is, we <unk>, we <unk> the <unk> <unk> the whole <unk> of the <unk> industry.
<unk>. If you can't do it from TED, where you can't it?
It's a main source of energy.
<unk>, we're working on the same <unk> to create <unk> <unk>.
You've seen this year with flu, we're always back to a year and with a dollar in less when it's about to find the right right.
I think what you can change in <unk> <unk>.
That's how the future could start to be <unk>, now, the tree of evolution, <unk> the evolution of bacteria, <unk>, <unk>, and finally <unk>.
We are so <unk> to <unk> people.
Our purpose is to do in a way to live enough to try to try to try to try to try to <unk>.
<unk> of all I'll show you, the <unk> <unk>, some of the new technology that we <unk> to the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. This is just a year ago. This is <unk>.
It's a environment that you can <unk> is to local level that you can <unk> with a huge amount of data.
Here we're seeing <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>, for a <unk> <unk>, to a <unk> <unk>, <unk> the images like.
And it doesn't matter how big much of information that we see, how big are these <unk> of data or images.
Most of the most <unk> pictures, but this for example is a <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk>, and <unk> in the <unk> of <unk>.
It doesn't do any difference because the only thing that we <unk> the <unk> of a system like this is the number of <unk> on your screen in any time. It's also an <unk> architecture.
This is a book, example of data, not images.
This is the <unk> <unk>. Every <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
So, I think it's just about <unk> and not images, we can do something like this, to see that it's a real <unk> of the <unk>, not a picture.
It may be a way to read a little <unk> to read a book.
I'll not <unk>.
This is a <unk> example. It's a <unk> of a <unk> of the <unk>.
Every image is the beginning of a <unk>.
And it really gives you the <unk> and the beautiful experience of the <unk> of a <unk> or a <unk>, which is for nature a <unk> of a half a half, which is a half a half a half a half.
We also made something with the corner of this <unk> in particular number of <unk>.
We created a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk>, you can see here.
Or other models, or even the <unk> <unk>.
And this really <unk> some of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of space on the screen.
And I think this <unk> <unk> to <unk> and other <unk> <unk>, not more <unk>.
Of course, the <unk> is one of the most <unk> of this kind of technology.
And on this, I don't want to <unk>, if we don't say we have <unk> to <unk> in this field.
These are all the <unk> in the U.S. <unk> over an <unk> image of NASA.
So now I'll <unk> something else.
This is actually in the web of the web; you can <unk> to see.
It's a project called <unk>, which we're going to <unk> two different technologies.
One is <unk> and the other is a <unk> <unk> in the computer computer very interesting <unk> <unk>, one of the <unk> of Washington, with the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And it's in the web <unk>, <unk> from <unk>.
You can <unk> when we do this kind of <unk>, where we can go from another and <unk> and <unk> this kind of experience.
But the <unk> <unk> of images here has actually actually a meaning.
The <unk> of <unk> <unk> have <unk> these images together, in the way that we <unk> to <unk> places that <unk> all the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> are <unk>. Here you see the <unk> of one <unk> <unk>, and these things are all <unk> in the <unk> <unk>, and these things are all <unk> in <unk>.
I don't know if I've got to show you some other environment.
There are a lot of more <unk>.
I want to go to one of the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> data, and this <unk> from a <unk> <unk> of <unk> that we did work for the first time to show you what we really really <unk> the key behind this technology, and it's not <unk> the key <unk> <unk> that we have in the website. And it's not <unk> as we have <unk> in the website.
We had to <unk> <unk> and forth.
This is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> images of <unk>, other <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and saying. <unk> these <unk> <unk> <unk>. And so we <unk> these <unk> <unk> <unk>.
So, I've got all <unk> <unk> and you're all <unk> at the <unk> level.
And it's possible to <unk> this way.
You know, I would never have thought of to work for <unk>.
It's very <unk> <unk> this kind of <unk> here.
I think that's a lot of different types of <unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, a <unk> number of those <unk> <unk>, a <unk> number, <unk> together in this environment.
And if I can, I can <unk> to try to look at those <unk>.
There are <unk> by <unk>, <unk>.
And in the <unk> here is a series of pictures -- <unk>.
This is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We can go from the <unk> of physics.
The <unk> point is that we can do about things with the social environment. This is <unk> data from the whole memory of <unk> as <unk> the land, from the point of view, and the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> all of the data, and we can <unk> all this data together.
All those pictures become <unk> together, more than the parts.
You have a model of the entire <unk> that <unk>.
Think about this as the <unk> of the <unk> of the Earth <unk>.
It's something that that <unk> in complexity that people <unk>, and the <unk> of people, and the <unk> of those <unk> <unk> with the use.
<unk> are <unk> with <unk> <unk> from other people.
If somebody's <unk> to <unk> all these <unk> <unk> <unk>, my picture of <unk> <unk>, my picture of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and I can use it as a <unk> <unk> in that space, using the picture of the <unk> of <unk>, and <unk> <unk>.
Of course, a <unk> of all of this is <unk> <unk> of every <unk> of the <unk>, <unk> not only from <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk>.
<unk>.
Chris Anderson: I realized? What's what your software software <unk> us to do is that in a certain point, in the next years, all the <unk> of anyone in the world world will be <unk> <unk> together?
<unk>: Yes. What's doing is basically <unk>.
It's creating <unk>, if you want, between images.
And it's doing it in the <unk> of images.
And the thing becomes very interesting if you think about the <unk> of information that many of these images <unk>.
As when you do a research research of the web, you <unk> a <unk> and the <unk> on the web of the web has a lot of about the pictures of the picture.
Now, what happens if that picture you <unk> to all your picture of your picture?
So the amount of <unk> <unk> and the amount of <unk> that <unk> is really enormous. It's a <unk> effect of the network.
CA: <unk>, it's really incredible.
<unk>: I'll <unk> you very much.
One of the <unk> <unk>, when you <unk> and one of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, the <unk> of the <unk>, <unk> the <unk> <unk>, between the <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> thinking that the <unk> <unk> still <unk> <unk> <unk>, or that the <unk> of <unk> <unk>, or <unk> <unk> are still <unk> <unk> <unk>, or <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk>, to remember the <unk> <unk>, to remember the <unk> of the <unk>, and that the idea that the world in which we live in in which is not just a sense, but it's a sense of a <unk>,
the <unk> of a particular <unk> of choices that our <unk> has done, or <unk>, very <unk>, many <unk>.
And, of course, we're all <unk> of the <unk> <unk>.
All <unk>. <unk>.
We're <unk> to <unk>.
We have to <unk> the <unk> of death, so we don't <unk> us if you <unk> and <unk> --
We all have a art art.
What <unk> is the <unk> <unk> of the song, the <unk> of the <unk> of every culture.
It doesn't matter that it's the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk>, or the <unk> of <unk> <unk>, the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, the <unk> of the <unk>, or a <unk> in the heart of the <unk>.
He was my <unk> of a month ago, in the <unk> a month ago, or a <unk> of <unk> in the <unk>, the <unk> mother of the world.
All these <unk> <unk> that there are other ways of <unk> that there are other ways of thinking, other ways to move in the world.
And, if you <unk> a moment, it's a concept that can give you hope.
<unk>, the <unk> of the world create a <unk> of life and <unk> that <unk> the planet and it's important to the <unk> of the planet, as the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> as the <unk> <unk> <unk> as <unk>.
And you can think about this <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and you can <unk> the <unk> of all the <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> in the human imagination.
The <unk> is the great <unk> of humanity.
It's the <unk> of what we are and what we can be in how much <unk> species.
And <unk> the <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> was <unk> <unk>, and <unk> very much more <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, for example, <unk> that 50 percent of all the species is the <unk> of all the species is just because it's <unk>, or -- in the most <unk> -- in the <unk> of the <unk> of the diversity.
The <unk> of all is, of course, the <unk> <unk>.
When you're <unk> <unk> <unk> on this planet.
One language is not only <unk> by a <unk> or a series of rules of <unk> rules.
One language is the <unk> of the human spirit.
It's the middle of which the <unk> of every culture comes in the world.
Every language is a forest of the mind, a <unk>, a <unk>, a <unk> of <unk>.
And of those <unk> <unk>, as we're in <unk>, at least half the <unk> of the <unk> of the children.
They're not more <unk> to children, which means, to say, to less than they're already death.
What's more <unk> than the <unk> of being <unk> from the <unk>, of the last to talk about a language, of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the kids?
This <unk> <unk> was <unk> in some of the world every two weeks, in the <unk> of every two weeks, <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> of a <unk> language.
And I know that somebody of you <unk>. "It's not better?
The world doesn't be a better place if we <unk> all the same language? "<unk>, then we're going to <unk>.
<unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, <unk>, what means to be able to talk about their language.
Today, I'd like to do you to do a journey through the <unk> --
a little journey in the <unk> to give you a <unk> of what we're <unk>.
Most of us <unk> that when I say, "different ways of <unk>." I mean, I mean, very different ways of <unk>.
<unk> for example, this <unk> <unk>, in <unk> <unk>, the <unk> of the <unk>, which <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>.
It's a <unk> that it's not able to <unk> the blue color of the green because the <unk> <unk>.
They have a <unk> language and a <unk> rule, <unk> <unk>, "<unk> <unk>," <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> person that's a different language.
This has <unk> in the past <unk>, yet the <unk> is that in these families that they talk six or seven <unk> <unk>.
It's going to listen and then <unk> to talk about.
<unk> one of the most interesting <unk> with which I've lived, the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, a <unk> <unk> that had the first <unk> in the <unk>.
In <unk> five <unk> have <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
They made <unk> from the top of the <unk> that we <unk> them in <unk> that <unk> <unk>, <unk> that this <unk> of the forest <unk> <unk> had never seen nothing.
They <unk> the picture from the ground, the <unk> of a form or a <unk> and <unk>, not <unk>, they <unk> that <unk> <unk>, and they <unk> the five <unk> with <unk>.
But the <unk> <unk> not only <unk> the <unk>.
They <unk> between them.
<unk> percent of the <unk> <unk> was <unk> by their own.
We're <unk> eight <unk> and we found two cases of death and when we <unk> to know, they <unk> to know, they <unk> that one of them was so that they <unk>. And they <unk> it. And then they <unk> it. And then they <unk> it.
<unk> were able to recognize the animal <unk> from 40 <unk> and <unk> the species.
I was the early '<unk>, I was <unk> a really interesting task when my <unk> of <unk> <unk>, I wanted to go to <unk> between the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
To give a sense of <unk>, I would have to understand the <unk> culture and the <unk> is not <unk> <unk>.
It's pretty much of a <unk> <unk> <unk> of the world.
It's interesting.
If you <unk> you to <unk> the big <unk> of the world, what I <unk>?
<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, etc.
A continent is always left out, <unk>, thinking that Africa has not <unk>. And instead, it's not another that the <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>.
What makes interesting is the <unk> is the <unk> between life and death.
So the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> can be <unk> by the <unk> <unk>, <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>.
So, the <unk> <unk> <unk>, "<unk> <unk>, you go to talk about God.
We <unk> in the <unk> and <unk> God. "
And from the moment you're <unk>, is the spirit that you can <unk> you, how can you get <unk>?
So, they <unk> these incredible <unk>: <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a rather <unk> of the power of the <unk> in the body when it was in a <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
And we all have <unk> with which I've lived the most <unk> <unk> are the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk>, in the <unk> <unk>.
<unk> of the <unk> civilization that <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
In a <unk> continent of blood, this <unk> never been <unk> by <unk>.
In <unk>, I'm <unk> by a <unk>, but their <unk> <unk> is <unk>.
The young young <unk> are <unk> from families or four years, and they live in a world fact, and they live in a world <unk> <unk> <unk> for 18 years.
Two <unk> of nine years of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk>, now are <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>.
So, this time, they're <unk> to values of their society, values that <unk> their <unk> and only their <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- <unk> <unk> <unk>.
In the <unk> of this <unk> <unk>, they're <unk> <unk> out and for the first time in their life, at the age of 18 years, they see an <unk>. And in that moment of the first <unk>, when the sun <unk> the sun, all of the first <unk> <unk>, all that they <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, all that <unk> <unk> <unk>. The <unk> <unk> is <unk>.
"<unk>? I said,"
It's <unk>. Now, it's about you.
They're called <unk> <unk>, <unk>, we're the <unk> of the world of the <unk> of the world.
This is extremely important.
When we think about <unk> <unk> and the <unk> environment, the <unk> story of the <unk> <unk>, which is a <unk> concept in its <unk> or maybe maybe <unk> and we say these <unk> are more than we're more <unk> to the Earth.
<unk> <unk> are not <unk> <unk> <unk>.
There's no space for these things in the <unk> of the <unk> or in the <unk> of the <unk>, but <unk>, to the <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, but on a <unk> <unk> <unk>. But it's a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
What does it mean?
<unk> to say that a <unk> of the <unk> that the mountain is a <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> is going to be a human <unk> and <unk> <unk> that <unk> that a <unk> <unk> that <unk> a <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> a mountain of <unk> that a <unk> <unk> <unk> that a mountain <unk> <unk> <unk> that a mountain <unk> of <unk>.
That's the <unk> of a spirit or a <unk> <unk> is <unk>.
What is interesting is the <unk> that <unk> the relationship between the <unk> and the natural world.
I grew up in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> that the <unk> <unk> to be <unk>.
And it made me a human being different from my friends who believe that they believe that the <unk> are the <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> that live in the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, <unk> that are in the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
If we start to <unk> that these <unk> can actually create different <unk>, <unk> to start to understand some of them <unk>.
I <unk> this picture at <unk> <unk>.
Maybe some of you have heard about the <unk>, the most powerful <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk>.
What makes the <unk> is not the <unk> potential of the <unk> of the <unk>, but its <unk>. And it's <unk> by two elements.
<unk>, this <unk> <unk> that has a series of <unk>, which has a series of <unk>, <unk>.
<unk> the only <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, which <unk> a little bit of the <unk>, but it's <unk> with the <unk> of a <unk> of the family <unk> said.
This <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, very similar to the <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
If you ever'll see the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> that they do from a different <unk> of <unk> species, <unk> <unk>.
<unk> that <unk> on the <unk> is a little bit like being <unk> by a <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a sea of electricity. <unk>'t make a <unk> of the reality of the reality of the reality of reality; it's a <unk> of reality.
<unk>, often with my <unk>, Richard <unk> <unk>, the man who <unk> was <unk>, with his discovery of the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>.
My <unk>, you can't tell these <unk> as you can't tell you about <unk> because if you're done, you can't tell nobody of being <unk>. <unk>. <unk> <unk>. <unk> <unk>.
It's possible to <unk> <unk>, if you can only <unk> with other <unk> <unk> that <unk>.
Now, the beautiful: the <unk> that are in this <unk> are <unk> of the <unk>, of the same kind of <unk> to <unk> the <unk>. The question is <unk> <unk>: in a <unk> of <unk> species of plants, like these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We use the big <unk> of <unk> and the <unk>, which can <unk>.
But if we go to the <unk>, we'll be <unk>. "
What does it mean?
This <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, who <unk> <unk> in the forest, and that we <unk> in the same species.
If you look at the <unk> like <unk>, we <unk> us, "<unk> of plants," <unk>, you don't know everything? "I said," No. "
The solution is, you're <unk> <unk> in a night in a night of the moon and <unk> with a <unk> <unk>.
With this not this <unk>, but it's much more interesting that that <unk> the <unk>.
Now, <unk> the problem is that also the problem is that also the heart of us who have to the heart <unk> <unk> them, but in some <unk> of the history of the world, and over.
In fact, the <unk> century, <unk>, not <unk> <unk> for its <unk> or its <unk> <unk>, but rather as the <unk> <unk> <unk>, but rather like the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the planet.
All the <unk> through the <unk> have been <unk> in a <unk> to new <unk> of life.
And the problem is not the technology.
<unk> <unk> have no <unk> of being <unk> when they put from the <unk>, and <unk> as the <unk> <unk>, they don't have <unk> <unk> <unk>, when they <unk> have <unk> <unk>, and <unk>.
It's not the change or technology that <unk> the <unk> of the <unk>. And the power.
The <unk> <unk> of <unk>.
And if you look at the world, we're not <unk> <unk> to <unk>.
They're <unk> creatures, and <unk> <unk> out of the <unk> forces that go beyond their ability to <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> --
<unk> <unk>, in the <unk> <unk>, a <unk> that has been <unk> in the forest to a generation ago, and now we <unk> to the <unk> and the <unk> <unk>, where you can see the <unk> <unk> <unk>, where it seems to the <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk>,
We <unk> <unk> with the <unk> <unk> <unk> to the forest.
Or, in the case of the <unk>, are the diseases that are <unk> with the discovery of <unk>.
If we <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk>, where I'm doing a lot of research, you'll see the <unk> of the <unk> of the political <unk>.
As <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, is <unk> <unk>, it's <unk> to <unk>, but the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk>, not only it's <unk>, but it's <unk> in certain <unk>, because it's <unk> in some <unk>, because it's part of the development.
And you can't understand the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the beginning.
I've got the <unk> miles from <unk> in China through the <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> with a young <unk>, but just to <unk> it. I realized what there's behind the <unk> that I <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> million people <unk> from the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The father's <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> that means that was <unk> to the <unk> of the Chinese <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> that <unk> in the <unk> that <unk> <unk> in <unk>.
<unk> mother was <unk> and his <unk> was <unk>.
It was <unk> to <unk> in <unk> age of two years, <unk> <unk>, because she couldn't live without him.
The <unk>, who did the same, was <unk> in the <unk> of <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and for this <unk>, for this <unk>, was <unk> to the work for seven years.
The pain of the <unk> can be <unk>, but the <unk> of the spirit of the <unk> is from <unk> <unk>.
And then, all of it <unk> to a choice.
<unk> in the <unk> world of the <unk> or we want to <unk> the world of diversity?
The big <unk> <unk> <unk>, before they were <unk> to die, and she said that his greatest <unk> was that, in our <unk> <unk> <unk> of the world, not only <unk> the whole <unk> of the <unk> of the human imagination, not only <unk> the entire <unk> of the <unk> of the human imagination, but a day we were other <unk>.
And it's <unk> to remember that our species is <unk> for <unk> years.
The <unk> <unk>, who has given us, which has <unk> us to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk>, <unk> the <unk> of the <unk>, and we talk about <unk> years ago.
The <unk> world <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And that <unk>, I didn't <unk> that we have the answers to all the challenges that we could <unk> in the <unk> to come.
When these <unk> of <unk> <unk> of the world is asked what we're human, <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And it's in these answers that we all <unk> the possibility of being what we are: a species, <unk>, which has to <unk> and all the <unk> and all the <unk> can <unk>. And there are big moments of <unk>.
I <unk> this picture on the <unk> of the island of <unk>, when I went to <unk> with <unk> <unk>, and this man, <unk> me, <unk> me the wonderful story of his <unk>.
The government <unk> is not always <unk> with the <unk> <unk> <unk> and in the <unk> <unk>, we <unk> them in <unk>.
The <unk> of this man <unk> <unk>.
The family, <unk> for his life, <unk> <unk> all the <unk>, and all of his <unk>.
You know that <unk> doesn't <unk> the cold, <unk>.
The <unk> of <unk> <unk> were made of fish <unk> in the skin of <unk>.
The <unk> of this man didn't <unk> from night or <unk> <unk>.
It's <unk>, you <unk> the <unk> in the skin of <unk> and <unk> in your hand. When I did it <unk>, you have <unk>, <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk>.
He <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk> of <unk> and when <unk> <unk>, <unk> a dog.
He <unk> the dog and created a <unk>, with the <unk> <unk> <unk> has created a <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> to talk about <unk> with nothing? "And this, in different ways, <unk>. <unk> is the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and all the <unk> of the world.
<unk> <unk> <unk> government government <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> of a <unk> area of <unk> <unk>.
It's their new <unk>. It's called <unk>.
It's a <unk> <unk>. We <unk> all the resources.
One example of how a <unk> can <unk> with his <unk>.
And, to end, I think it's rather <unk> at least at least at least who we're <unk> at all <unk> of the planet, and they're not <unk>.
For someone is a house.
<unk> <unk> of human imagination that <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> of times. And for us, the dreams of these children, as the dreams of our children, they <unk> of hope.
For, we have <unk> <unk> that <unk> are <unk> that <unk> that <unk> never <unk>.
<unk> that <unk> --
And they <unk>. <unk> are not <unk>, but we believe that stories can change the world, and maybe we are the best <unk> to tell the stories of the world. Every month our <unk> <unk> <unk> million <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> our <unk> <unk>.
Our <unk> are <unk> by millions of people.
Our work is <unk> in the <unk> to bring our public in places of <unk> <unk> from which <unk> <unk> from which <unk> <unk>, and they <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and we have to find a <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of diversity, and we have to find a <unk> <unk> <unk> in a <unk> and <unk> world.
where the <unk> of all the <unk> can <unk> in our <unk> <unk>.
Thank you.
I'll talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I could <unk> other that you've already heard about and <unk> <unk> some <unk>, in the case, you don't <unk> them.
I'd like to start with what I call "the <unk> <unk>."
The <unk> <unk> of what?
The <unk> <unk> of all the society <unk> <unk> <unk>. The <unk> <unk> <unk>, "If we want to <unk> the <unk> of our citizens."
The reason is, from one side, in fact that the <unk> of the <unk>, is <unk>, <unk> to human beings.
<unk> else is in fact that if we are <unk>, each of us can <unk>, to do everything that we <unk> our <unk>, without no one that we <unk> our <unk>, without no one that we <unk> in our <unk>.
The way to <unk> the freedom is <unk>.
<unk> people have, more choices are <unk>, and more, is their <unk>, the <unk> of the most <unk>, is their <unk>.
This, <unk>, <unk>, it's so <unk> <unk> in the society that nobody <unk> <unk> in <unk>.
And it's also <unk> <unk> in our lives.
I'll show you some examples of what the progress has made.
This is my <unk>. It's not particularly big.
I was a simple <unk> on the <unk>.
In my <unk>, there are <unk> <unk>, without <unk> the 10 <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> that you can buy for a huge <unk> of <unk> in the <unk> <unk> that nobody of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> that nobody of <unk> already.
That's how the <unk>.
And then you go to the <unk> <unk> to buy a <unk>: <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
And in this single <unk> <unk>, there's a big number of <unk> <unk>.
We can do six million different <unk> using the <unk> that there are in a <unk>.
<unk> <unk> that there is <unk>.
<unk> <unk>: The world of the <unk>.
And once, when I was a child, you could get all the <unk> services, <unk> that were <unk> <unk> <unk>.
You <unk> the phone, you don't <unk> it.
One of that, between the other, was that the phone, it was not <unk>.
These days, they went.
We have a <unk> <unk> <unk>, especially between the <unk> <unk>.
Here's the <unk> of the future.
My <unk> is what in the middle, <unk> <unk>, <unk> of the <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk>.
If you don't have any case you've seen in the <unk> <unk>, you're very certain that they're going to be <unk>.
And what's the end is that people <unk> in the <unk> and it's the answer? And you know, it's the answer? The answer is "No."
It's not possible to buy a phone that doesn't <unk> things.
So, in other things of life that are very much more than the <unk>, <unk> the same <unk> of choices.
<unk> <unk>: <unk>, not that's going to be in the United States that you have to do.
Instead, I <unk> from the <unk>, and the <unk> says, "OK, we could do it, or <unk>," <unk>, "<unk>," <unk> these <unk> and these <unk>. What do you want to do? "
You know, I said, "<unk>, what do you do?"
And the <unk> says, "<unk>, he's <unk> these <unk> and these <unk>, and <unk> these <unk>."
"What do you want to do?"
And you say, "<unk> if she was, what do?"
And the <unk> said, "But I don't she's."
The result of the <unk> of the <unk>, "<unk>," <unk> that makes it <unk>.
But in fact, it's not that one <unk> the weight and responsibility to take decisions from somebody who knows something, <unk> the <unk>, <unk>, to <unk> the <unk>, to <unk> <unk>, and it's almost <unk> -- and so not in the <unk> <unk> for the patient.
There's a huge <unk> of products, <unk>, <unk> to people like me and you, if you think it's not any sense, because we can't <unk>.
But if we can't <unk>, why do we can't we <unk> it?
The answer is that they want to <unk> the <unk> to <unk> the <unk> <unk>.
And so it's how we're our <unk> <unk>. It's a question of choice, like, you see in this <unk> <unk>. "We don't want to <unk> the kids." <unk> the right now. "<unk> <unk>. We have to <unk>.
And we can <unk> how many times we <unk>.
The that means that every <unk>, you have to decide that that kind of want to be.
<unk> to the family and the <unk>, a <unk> of common time, <unk>, almost for anyone, was that <unk> the <unk> <unk>, and you can <unk> to <unk> kids as possible.
The only real choice was with who, not when, and even even what to do after.
<unk>, all it's really to play.
<unk> to <unk> students, and they <unk> their 20 percent in less than work.
And because they're not less <unk>, because they're not less <unk>.
But why I'm <unk>, <unk> to <unk>, "<unk> <unk> or not?"
"<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>? I have to think before the children or <unk>?"
They're <unk> <unk>.
And they try to answer these questions, even though this <unk> doesn't get the <unk> that <unk> and not get a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And they really have to do it. They're important questions.
Now, the work: we are <unk>, like <unk> <unk>, because technology allows us to work every day, every day, from every day, from the <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, there's a <unk>, and I don't know what it works.
I'm not saying, because I want to use it.
What does, this incredible <unk> of choice that we have about work? That's that we have to <unk>, <unk> in every time, if we have to work or not.
We can go to see our son to <unk>, with the <unk> in a <unk>, the <unk> in the other, and the <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, on the <unk>.
And even if they're all <unk>, every minute that we see our <unk> <unk>, we're also <unk>, "I have to answer this?"
"I have to answer this <unk>? I have to <unk> this letter?"
And even when the answer is, it's "no, this makes the experience of your <unk> <unk>, very different than what would be in other conditions.
So, from any part of the <unk>, and big, big, and big, life is a question of choices.
And once the world was this: <unk>, there were some of the <unk>, but it wasn't all that.
The world of today I'm going to do this: The <unk> is, "What is, or <unk>?"
The answer is <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> them all, so we know, so I'll talk about the <unk>.
<unk> this <unk> <unk> <unk> two actually actually <unk> on people.
The first, <unk>, is that it <unk> <unk>.
With a lot of <unk> between which <unk>, becomes very hard to do.
I'll show you a <unk> example: a study of <unk> on <unk> <unk>.
A <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> society, <unk> society <unk>, about a million <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk>.
What she found is that for every 10 solutions that are <unk> in the most, the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> of the two percent.
With 50 <unk> <unk>, there's 10 percent in less than <unk> when they're only <unk> <unk>. Why?
Because with 50 <unk> in which <unk>, is <unk> to <unk>, and the choice is <unk> to <unk>.
And at <unk>, and again, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and of course, <unk>, <unk>, and of course, <unk>, <unk>, and of course, <unk>, <unk>, and of course, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and of course, <unk>, <unk>, and of course, <unk>, <unk>, and of course, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and <unk>,
<unk> that doesn't just mean that these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, because they don't have enough money, it's <unk> that <unk> the decision is that <unk> the <unk> of work.
<unk>, they're not <unk>, they're <unk> to five <unk> year from <unk> <unk>, which would be <unk> to <unk>.
So, the <unk> is a <unk> of <unk> choices.
And I think that we <unk> the world.
And to end, to the <unk>: <unk>, <unk>, <unk> or <unk>? "
<unk> just to take the right decision, if it's to <unk>, it's true?
You don't want to choose the wrong wrong, and <unk> the <unk> wrong.
So this is the first effect. The second is that also if we can <unk> the <unk> and do a choice, at the end of the <unk> of the <unk> of how they were <unk> with less <unk> in which <unk>.
And this for different reasons.
One of these is that with many <unk> of which, if you have a lot of <unk> between the <unk>, it's not perfect, it's easy to imagine that it would be better. And what's that's that the <unk> <unk> <unk> us to <unk> us to <unk> us to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And when it was a <unk> decision.
<unk>, more choices, it's more <unk> than <unk> that is <unk> of the <unk> of choice.
<unk>, there's what the <unk> call.
<unk> <unk> has <unk> very well as the value that we do things that we <unk>.
<unk>, when there are many possible <unk>, it's easy to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>.
Here's a example. I <unk> with all of the ones that are not in New York.
But it's what we probably <unk>.
There's this <unk> <unk>.
A place of <unk>.
<unk> <unk>. <unk> day. It's all about them.
<unk> nothing. But what he <unk> thinks it's, "Well, <unk>, it's <unk>."
"All my <unk> <unk> are <unk>."
"<unk> <unk> <unk> in front of the home."
And it's two weeks from the idea that's <unk> -- every day -- the <unk> of where it wants.
The <unk> <unk> <unk> for what we have, even when the choice was <unk>.
And the most <unk> that we have from <unk>, more <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> us to <unk> it against how <unk>.
Here's another example.
This <unk> tells us a lot of things.
It's about the <unk> moment, and maybe the time.
But the most important is that that you're <unk>, you're <unk>, you're not doing other.
The things that are not <unk> have many <unk> that can make less <unk> what we do.
<unk> <unk> <unk>.
I tried to my skin <unk> a new <unk>.
<unk> <unk>.
Once the <unk> were just a <unk>, <unk> them, and <unk> <unk>, were <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> to go.
So, I went to <unk> a couple of <unk>, when they were <unk>, and I said, "I need a couple of <unk>, this is my <unk>."
The <unk> <unk> said, "<unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>?"
You want to <unk> them or with the <unk>? "<unk>" <unk>? "
"<unk> them wants to <unk>?"
"<unk> <unk> them or <unk>? <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> --" <unk> to <unk>.
I was <unk>, and after a little bit I could say, "I want the kind of -- that was the only kind of <unk>." It had no idea what I had, and I <unk> <unk> <unk>, then I <unk> <unk>, and then <unk> from the <unk>, with the best <unk> that I had ever had.
It was the <unk>. I had all the <unk>.
But I'll <unk> worse.
Why? I wrote a whole book for <unk>.
The reason I was worse is that with all my <unk> <unk> were <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
I had <unk> <unk>. I didn't <unk> me to <unk> it. I had only a kind of <unk>, but when we <unk> 100 different <unk>, at least one kind of had to be perfect.
What I had was <unk>, but not perfect.
After I was <unk> what I was <unk> in <unk>.
The <unk> of <unk> people don't <unk> that <unk> the <unk> that these are <unk> that these <unk> are <unk>.
And this <unk> less <unk>, even when the results are good.
<unk> in the world of the <unk> <unk> if you're going to get it.
Because if I <unk> it, I don't know what I'm talking about.
The truth is <unk> to this.
"And he was better when he was worse worse." The reason he was that when he was worse than when he was <unk> was <unk>.
<unk>, in the world that we live in -- <unk>, <unk> citizens with the <unk> of the <unk> -- the <unk> that we can <unk> is that things are at the <unk>.
You've never <unk> <unk> because your <unk>, my <unk>, my <unk>, you're <unk>.
The <unk> of happiness -- what you're here -- is, "<unk> <unk>," Yes, "Yes," Yes, you want. "
I mean, I mean, I really, I really really <unk> and my wife is really <unk>.
I couldn't do better, I couldn't do better, I could not be <unk>.
But <unk>, it doesn't always be a <unk> thing.
<unk>, a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> when there's just that kind of <unk> is that when you're not <unk>, and you're not <unk>, and you're not <unk>, and you're <unk>, "Why?"
"Who is <unk>?" "" "<unk> is <unk>.
The world is the <unk>. What I could I do?
When there are hundreds of <unk>, and you have a <unk>, and you're going to <unk> you who is the <unk>, is <unk> that the <unk> you are you.
They could do better.
With hundreds of <unk> available, there are not <unk> for <unk>.
So when people are doing decisions, even if the result is <unk>, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, as well.
In the last years, the <unk> is <unk> in the world.
I think a <unk> <unk> -- not the only one, but it's <unk> -- of this <unk> of <unk> is just that people have <unk> experiences because the <unk> <unk> are too <unk>.
And when they have to <unk> this situation they think that the <unk> is.
So the final result is that we're better, <unk>, but we're going to be worse.
I'll say you.
This is the <unk> <unk>, what we're all going to do for good and it's completely <unk>.
There's no <unk> that a little bit of choice, which is not <unk> that much better than it, but it doesn't have much much choice of a little bit.
There's a value <unk>, <unk>. I don't know what.
But I'm sure we've <unk> from a piece of the level of the level of the <unk>,
Now, from the point of view, I've been <unk> -- from the point of view, the <unk> is the <unk>.
What allows this is all this choice in the <unk> society is the <unk> material.
There are many places in the world, and you have to <unk>, in which the problem is not that they have <unk> choice.
The problem is that they have too <unk>.
So, the <unk> I'm talking about is a <unk> <unk> of <unk>, <unk> society.
And what it <unk> <unk> and <unk> is this: <unk> <unk> you talked about about how these <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. It's a <unk> of money.
I mean, these choices, <unk> and <unk>, it's not that they're just <unk>.
They're <unk> <unk>.
They do worse.
If a little bit of what we <unk> in our society allows us to <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This is what the <unk> call a <unk> <unk>.
A <unk> of the income <unk>. We're not only to the poor people -- because of this choice in <unk> that we <unk> us.
So, to end, you can become everything you want to --
<unk>, people, <unk>, <unk>, "But what's going to do that fish?"
"It's <unk> that you can't do anything in a <unk> of glass."
"A <unk> <unk>, a <unk> <unk> of the world --
and I <unk> it, I <unk>.
But then, <unk>, instead, I made me that fish knows that fish is the long <unk> knows.
Because the reality of the fact of it is that if you <unk> in the <unk>, in the way that, you can't <unk> the freedom.
If you <unk> the <unk> in the way that everything we could <unk> it possible.
<unk> the <unk>, and <unk> the <unk>.
All they need a <unk>.
This is almost <unk> too <unk>, maybe even for the fish, and it's <unk> for us.
But the <unk> of some <unk> <unk> is a <unk> for <unk> and, <unk>, for <unk>.
Thank you very much.
