And last year I showed these slides to demonth to show that the calculate calculatory, which for almost three million years had the size of 408 US continental in the size of 40-percent.
However, this subvalue of the problem because it doesn't exhate the ice of the ice problem because it doesn't exhold the ice of the ice problem because it is not the spessential of the ice problem because it is not the exhibition of the ice problem because it doesn't exhit the gravity of the ice problem because it is not the exhipessential of the problem because it
The glacial calculatory is in a certain sense, the heart custom.
You get to inverse and you get it and you get it into the summer.
The next degree is going to be a quick in the last 25 years.
The ice lost of loss are signed in red red red red.
As you can see it goes to the blue blue blue box.
That's the ice in inverness, which is the summer.
You can see that the ice lost ice lost ice loss, five years or more, is like the blood of the body.
In 25 years of that was spent by so so that it is.
This is a problem because the size of the ice is an interesting terranger around the ocean to where there are enormous amount of carbon congelted that that is a coal amount of coal that you can get in the micro-bes.
It really, in the totality of the global warming, which is global warming, that amount of global warming, super-scale of this point of not return it to the point of not return.
In some deeping a little deeping in Alaska is already rebolling from water.
The professorse Katey Walter in the Alaska has been with a team with a team of a very lower lago the last last inver.
Video: Wow! Look! Look is good.
A reason is that this exchange of the normal warmer Groenland from the north.
This is a glacial phime glacial record.
And the laughed has never reached levels.
This is the fume Kangerlussuaq, in the soil of the Groenland of the Groenland,
If you want to know how it is the level of the sea ice of the ice of the land of the sea.
These are increasing are increasingly increasingly.
In the other part of the planet: Antarctic, the biggest block of the planet.
The month of the scientists have dear that the ice of the ice of ice is in negative, and that Antarcticle is in denial eyes on some of the waste of some of the issues.
Equid at six feet of water, like in Groenlland, like Groenlly.
Sull'Himalaya, the third biggest block of ice -- they see new laghi, and they see a few years ago were ice in the ice of the ice of the ice ice of ice --
40s of the world's population of the world's population for the monkey from the monkey to the monkey of the world's population.
Sulllle Ande: This ice is the water water water water from the water water of this city.
The portraised is increased.
But when he dimine -- the same thing happens to the water water water water water pound.
In California ned, in the Sierra Nevada of 40-percent.
The hydrogen is in crisis.
The previsions, as you have ready,
The growing growing in the world door a not-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-growing sexuity growing in the world door
The environmental disasters are increasing to a normal reporting outside and without precedents.
And then the most numbers in the last 30 years of respect the precedent of 75.
This is a load of all insustainable.
If you look at the story, if you can see the consequences.
In the last five years we added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million in the oceans every day.
Look at the Amermers' area of the Pacific, from Amermers' India, and on the parts of the subject of the subject of the subject of the subjectory of the ocean ans.
The biggest because of global warming, with the deforestation, which is 20-percent, which is the use of fossil of fossis.
The oil is a problem, and the carbon is even worse.
The United States are one of the two countries with the Cina.
And they provided to build a lot of carbon.
But we're getting a changing changing change.
These are the projects of the last last few years and some proposites of alternative versus of the last few years and some proposites of the last few years and some proposites of the last few years and some proposites.
At any way, there's a political lottacks in our country.
The carbon industry and oil industry has spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promoting carbon on the carbon on and the carbon die.
That image me to reminded me something.
I wanted Natal, in Tennessee, where there was a 3.8 billion poor billions of diet of carbon diet of carbon.
Maybe you have seen it on the news.
This is the second biggest flush in America.
It's success around Natal.
The natalia natalia a of coal industries was this.
Video: Frosty the carbonaio is a kind of slow and happy.
It's abundant here in America, and it makes our economy.
Frosty the carbon is always more clear and more cleaner than it.
It's a good price, adorables and the work work work and the work work of the best.
Al Gore: From here is a lot of the West Virginia.
The biggest society on the mountain is Massey Coal. This is his minister.
Video: Don Blland, he said, "Look at Gore, Nancy People -- not know what they're talking about.
Al Gore: So the Alleance for the Clim has been launched two campaign.
This is a bunch of it.
Video: Att: The COALergives we see the climate changes like a serious change as a serious minist.
So this is our priority is to invest a great amount of money in a real real force, to make public and consuming public and consuming the truth of the carbon.
In fact, carbon is not sport.
We think it's a pulied -- it's a good profum.
So not predicted.
Let me do us.
Video: Attor: Carbone can -- you heard a lot of it.
So let's do this this is a framework for a structure of carbon is a clean an of clean an aside.
Straordinary cars are a little road of a wheels -- but this is the sound of the carbon technology.
The carbon is between the main the main the main the global warming, but the night technology of carbon clean an powder that you see change.
To look at the hot: This is the odiern technology.
Al Gore: Infind, the positive alternative to the issues of the issues of the national economic and the national physics.
Video: Comment: The America is in the national economy, the national economy, the national maintains, the climate crisis.
The filter that the lines all the lines of fossil commons, like coal coal and oil, as the coal coal and oil.
Now, yet, there's a new solution for ushing solution for ushes.
Rear America: 1005 percent of clean energy in 10 years.
A plan to reput America to work in the work, to help us re-scale and help to help us to help the global warming.
Finally, a solution that is to solve our problems.
America. Sens.
Al Gore: This is the last one.
Video: Comment: It's about release to America.
One of the fastest ways of going to take the dependence of combuster than our planet.
Comparsa: The future is here.
He can be two 2: Novi investment for a lot of work of ben retribes.
Comment: Repower America. It's time to be realists.
Al Gore: A proverbio African old proverbio to go speed to go to speed by sun.
If you want to go back to them, go back to the together."
We have to go back to them, quickly.
Thank you very much.
And last year at TED I did a TED introduction on LHC.
And it turns out to get to the paper to you about how the machine.
So I got it. And for those who don't have to be there, the LHC is is the biggest scientific scientific experiment -- 27 miles of a conference of circence.
His is to rear the conditions that were feed less than a billion in the beginning of the universe -- until 600 million to the second to 600 million times a second.
All of this is just the untiles.
This is the machine in Ginev.
We do these min-Big Bang Bang in detectors.
This is what I work on. It's called ATLS -- is a 44 feet and has a 444 feet and has a 22 feet of 2222 feet and a 22 feet of 222 feet and has a 44 feet and has a 24 feet and a feet of 222 feet and a
This is an ATLS in building so you can see the proportions.
The 10 sectors we have accepted the car for the first time.
And this picture was taken by ATLS.
It was because of immended in the room in the room of control.
It's a picture of the first phase-fashion that had done all the around the LHC, in collision, deliberately, with a part of the LHC, and spreading particles in the sex.
In other words, when we see that image the 10 sector, we understood that the machine is a great liver lives.
I don't know if it was this to do us more opposition, when someone went on Google and vide that the beginning.
That means we had a culture impacted cultural impact.
About a week, there was a problem with the machine, to have this problem with the machine, to these films here -- these dors.
These are taken 13,000 printing when the machine works at the massit of the powerful powerful power.
Now, technical techniques between you will look at the films and did, "It's not true.
And instead can do it because when they are very fresh cosident cosident cosident files.
So, at least 271 degrees to a inference in the stellow in the stars, these films can bring that corporate that current in the stellow of the space.
In one of the way in the most of the nine in the LHC, there was a deft of fabrication.
So the films will be surprising ready, and 13,000 printing of a suddenly met a electrical resistance to the electrical reside.
This was the result.
Now, this is even more impressidents if you think these magnetic fish of 20 tons of 20 tons of about 30 centimeters.
It's been worse about 50 magnets.
We had to take them to proud it, what we did it.
We have repristined and folded the fair.
Now they're coming back to their undernear place.
Entrue the end of the LHC is will be new inteam.
And we just like it, and we expect to get the data to jugment or him, and continue so our avventure to find out what the morning, and so our own morning.
Now, of course, in a certain way, these accidents reaccendent on the value of science and engineering the value of science and engineering in front of it. It's easy to confuting.
I think that the fact that it's so hard to go to the limits, I think this is the value of things like LHC.
I would like to end with the words of a scientist Inglese scientist Humphrey Davy, and I difended with the experiments of his pupill, and his pupill, and he said, "No is a very dangerous for the human mind of the human mind of the remarkable of human mind as the red, and how the reef of the remaining of the human res, that are mysteries in nature is the new money,
Thank you.
I want to start asking you to rethink about how to do it for children, you play the morning.
And then you can understand how to reach them and make them them and move them and move them and move it to the problems of thinking and solving problems and resolution and so the relations of spaces.
The space is deeply is to connect to the way we understand the world around us.
So, by informath inspired by the useful of our interaction with physical objects with my Pacti, and my collaborator, and my collaborator, and my collaborator, and I started asking asking her, instead of having the only cursor of the mouse of the mouse of the mouse of the mouse of the mouse of the mouse to the digital redition with the hramatic of the hold of our hrammitting man,
and systems our pleasant to our pleasure for our pleasant to our pleasant to be able to get it to our pleasant to our pleasure and system?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer, building Siftable.
And in a few words, a Siftable computer.
And in a few words, a Siftable computer.
You can move to the hand the hand they can see the hand they can see the right movement and they have a screen and a radio wireless radio and a wireless radio wireless to it.
But most of course, are physically objects like the morning, you can just move to the miles.
Siftable is an example of a new ecosystem for a new instrument to manipulate information digital information.
And as they become more physicists, conscious than others, and they are others, and they become more physicists, and they become more physicists, and they are all the way to be able to exploring new and different stilets.
He started with some simple example.
This is a Siftable is to show of the vide: if you win a direction, the video rooters in a direction, the other side side side side from the other side.
These are interactives are connected to others.
If they are interested in what they are are interested in what they are inting.
If they get it to the night, they can get a little bit of it.
If they get it to the night, they can get a little bit of it.
They also have their movement and including them.
We then realized that one of the interesting interesting interesting interaction was able to use the community of the data, to be a few of the data, and a versation of the data as if it was a colord.
In this case, we have three Siftable configured as a sea and I can use them to be the color of the color in the middle of the color in the middle of the color in the middle of the color of the color in this case, where they missing in the middle of the color of the verb of the color in this case, where they are mis
and I can use them to be able to be the color in the central color where they missing them.
If we can get too much of it, we can put a little bit of it.
I'm also beautiful, as a chance of learning, as languages, mathematics and games of the logic and and see the results, and you see the right right right now.
Now I'm --
This is a Fibonaces that I do with a equations.
Here we have a words of words that is half in Scar, and Boggle.
And then then to be a letter to get the letter in every Siftable, Pratically, to every Siftable, Pratically, to every Siftable, and while you're trying to get words for a dictionary.
And then after about 30 seconds of the remissing and a new set of letters and new chance to prove and new chance to prove and make a new chance to prove and make a new bunch of letters and make a new bunch of letters and make a new chance to try to prove and make a new chance to provide and make a new by."
Thank you.
Here is what the children came in the Middle in Lab, I did it in a way that tried them and I went to a video.
They are pleased a lot.
And one of the interesting things of this kind of application is that you don't have to give you a lot of educational people in the instructions.
You've just got to say, "Compons of the word," and they know exactly what to do.
Here's how people who try it.
This is our head-head-header better.
It was actually wanted to be a clar.
They were only morning, for him.
Now, this is an application of a carton a whole interactive.
We wanted to build a tool, for the apprinting of the English English is Felix.
It can be able to get new characters in the scene, pleasure of their associated associated with their associated associated with their own associated to the other characters.
It can be able to get new characters in the scene, pleasure of their associated associated with their associated associated with their own associated to the other characters.
So it's doing the sun.
Video: The sole is surprise.
David Merrill: Now has brought a treatment in the scene.
Video: German treatment.
Bel job!
So we are Siftable and put it closer can interact the characters --
Video: Bau!
-- by inventing their story.
Video: Ho!
DM: It's a story with an open-end end and can decide him as you can decide it as you can decide it as you can decide it as a spring.
DM: It's a story with an open-end end and can decide him as you can decide it as you can decide it as you can decide it as a spring.
Video: Gulf the via, four.
DM: The last example I have time to show you is a tool, made of recently recently for sampling and exeguing music.
It's a tool, made of recently recently for sampling and exeguing music.
Siftable here are going to be based on the lower and bacteria --
Every one of these are four different variations, and you can choose what using it.
You can get these sounds in a sequence of comporate to your pleasure to your pleasure to your please.
And it just just just to make it just just just touch a sound."
These are actually you can control from living, like the reverse and the films.
The attack of a particular suck and then including slens to the stick of it.
And then there are actually general as time and volume, which is actually apply to the interest sequence.
Let's look at how it works.
Video: DM: We will try to put a basis in two Siftable Siftable "sequency" we can get in a series, we add other bases.
Now I just just a bunch of blow.
Video: DM: Now I add percent use --
Video: And now I'll put the filter to the bacteria, so I can control the effect of the live.
Video: I can speak the entire sequence of the sequence sequence on a time from a side or from the other.
Video: And now I add the bottom to give the lower to give more expression.
Video: I can recombined the sequence of the volune.
So I don't have to planning it before, but I can suddenly get more time.
And now, finally, I can sfue the entire sequence on the left the Siftable is the Siftable "volume."
Thank you.
So, as you can see my passion is to build new interfaces man-machine has always look like the brain and cord.
And today, I had time to show you one of the outside of this lost and some chance that we try to bring out of the lab of the lab of the lab of the lab of the lab of a performan.
The concept I want to transmit you is that is coming to this new generation of objects for interacting with digital digital media that will be information, in our world in the way we want.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the time to talk to all of you.
I am a writer.
And I want to be books is my professional exsion is more than that, obviously.
It's also love and the love and the each of my life.
And I don't expect that can change.
But then he said to this, something particularly in my life and in my career, who was taken me to reach the entire relationship with this work.
The particular thing is that I have recently written this book, this biography called "Mangia, Ama" the quality, Ama" the quality, Ama" the quality, for some reasons, for some reasons, for some reasons, in the world and become a great extensize, extens in the world and become a great inational action.
And the result is that anywhere you go to the people treme as if they were convicted to be condence.
It really is -- condanned -- condent --
They are going to be a concerned and say, "You don't have to be able to do better.
You don't just just just to write for all the life without being able to make a book that can be able to make a book that can important?
that can care about somebody?"
It's reasicurants, you know,
But it could go worse -- to me that more 20 years ago, when I started to say to people -- I was a to say to people -- I was a writer.
I would be in the same based on the same basis.
And people say, "Don't you have to be able to have succed?
You don't have a fear that the hummmitted kill?
You don't have to do this mestiate for all life without any life without any life without any of the die on a heart of a bank of a bank of sleeping cenerges with the bank of flife?"
So so we know it.
The answer -- the short response to all these questions is "Y."
Si.., I have folks of all of those things.
I always had fol.
And I also have a lot of other things that people can't have to be in it.
As the allow and other things that are spectacs.
But as much about the writing to write what I thought I was very much of the question is why is it is?
Is it rational?
It's logical that anyone who who have to wait to be a job that you feel about being sent to do.
But what is there is so particularly in previous presizes to be about the healthcare of the healthy in a way that other career in a way that other career not to do not phan?
As my father, for example, he was a chemical engineer and not remember a one time in his 40 years of activity where he was asked if he was asked if he was asked if he was asked if he was asked if he was asked if he had to be engineer to be an engineer and not remember, and I don't remember a chimproper, for example, he was a chimmess to be engineer if he was asked if he was asked if he was asked if he was asked if he
It was never -- that block of engineer and John, how do it happen?
It didn't work like this.
Onestly, chemistry engineers like they don't have certainly in the sea reputation of being alcolized by being alcolighed by being alcooled by depressisis.
We writer, we have enough this reputation, and not just writing but creatives of every general general of every general general of being enormously ablelevered by mind.
And it's not another that look at the death of the death of the magnificent deaths of the magnificent century, just in the 20th century, and often for them.
And even those who don't have been suicide seem to be really, in their womans.
Norman Mailer, before I died in the last last interviewed said, "My book has been killed a little bit more than the work of the work of life.
But we don't get to the boy when we feel like to say because we have these things so much as we have to be in some way we have completely interiorized and the notion of the notion that creativity and that art, the notion of the hand, and that the art, to the angod.
And the question I want to take all of the time today is you agree with this ide?
It's good to you know this thing -- because you can go from a distance of distance to me not good for this supposition.
I think it's odied.
And I think it's also dangerous and I don't want to see the perpetuated in the next century.
I think it's better to encourage our great minds creative vision.
And because I know that in my case -- in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to the suppositions, especially the constances of the constances in my career.
Of true -- insum is quite young, I have about 40 years.
I still have about four decade of work in me.
And it's very likely to be that anyone thing to write it will be just from the world as a work that he used to be a lot of the last book.
He slaves, because we all have more or less friends here -- is likely to my greatest success is to my greatest in my spalls.
Oh, Gesood, which though.
You know this is the kind of thinking that leads a person to start to be, and I don't want to do it.
I would just continue to do this work we do.
So, the question is, right?
And so I got to do it after a lot of reflection to write is to write and write is to create a psychological costructure, right?
I have somehow to find a distance of safety between me, which I'm writing and my natural analysis on which reaction is about which reaction to get to look at the time for the last year and look at the time to find other societies and more healthcare and more healthcare and more healthcare and more healthcare of the best blood and more healthcare and more healthy and more healthcare and more healthcare than we could have have been writing about how to get ideas and the
as to help people believe the people creative risks of the risks of the risks of creativity.
And that research me to the ancient Greek and ancient Room.
And then you know, because it goes into the circle and then go back to the back.
In the ancient Greek and ancient Roma -- people don't seem to believe that creativity became the creativity of the man, OK?
It was thought that creativity was this spirit and that they come to the man, and that came from a few surprising and unknows, for reasons and unknowing and unknows.
The green was called these spirits of the spirits of the creativity of the creativity of the creativity of the creativity of the creativity of the creativity of the creativity of the creativity of the creativity of the creativity of the creativity of the creativity of the "demony."
Socrate, wonderful creended to have a demone that elargives from most.
The Romans were the same idea, but they call that that a kind of spirit without a genius.
The one is great, because Romans didn't really really think that a genius was a particular intelligent of a particular intelligence was somebody particular around.
They believed that a genius was this kind of a kind of folded in the muri in the study of a study of a artist, a little bit like the elfer Dobby, and that came up to the work of the article and modeling the outside of that work.
It is a -- -- -- -- -- -- this is the distance of the worth of the psychological construct that has protected to your job.
And they all knew that it was so so that it works, right?
So the antic artists were property from certain things, like the too narcis; right?
If your work was exceptional jobs you couldn't get all the degree and all the deal of the deal of the incorporea.
If your work fail, it wasn't all cold, it was not all of your work -- right?
Everybody knew that was your genian inable incapable to be a inable to be a inable to be a inable to be a inabout.
And so people han concepts in Occident for a long time.
Then the Rindiculated and all change, and it changed this great idea, we put it in the middle of the universe in the middle of the universe and the mysters and without leaving to the details that write detained by devicity.
This was the principle of human remainly and people started thinking that creativity was to think that creativity came up from the idivid.
And for the first time in history, you know, it started to this or this artist as a kind of artist as a rather than a person with a kind of of a person.
And I have to tell you, I think it was a big mistake.
I think I can allowed someone, a simple person to believe that being a recipient as a recipe as the found, and the sisters of all the mysteries and unknowable and insucdenly as a very big as a right right to the fragile in the fragile that human.
It's like to ask someone to to save the sun.
And it was completely the ego and creates the ego and creates all these ingestiable ings.
And I think it's been this pression to have destruct artists in the past-year-old artists in the past.
And, if this is true, and I think that is the question is, and it becomes on?
Can we can do it different?
And then you get back to a more antic understanding of of the relationship between humans and mystery creative.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we can't get 500 years of thinking about 500 years of thinking about 18 minutes.
And there is people in the audience that would be a bunch of scientific puspects on the notion of the notion of the notion of the nurdering of their projects.
I probably don't know you have to convince you all about this thing.
But the question I would like to take is -- why is it?
Why don't don't think about this this way?
Because it has more sense of every other thing that has ever heard for explanation to explain the process of creative process.
A process that as anyone who ever tried to do something -- so, all here -- there is no fairly in the rational behavior.
And, in fact, it can sometimes look completely paranormal.
I did this recently with the extraordinary poeth Ruth Stone, which has now 90 years, but that was a poetches for all life and said, if you during his childhood in the Virginia, and I felt in the walls, and I felt in the field of the becomes comes from the becomes from the bear.
He said it was like a fragorous fragorous frage --
And that was coming to rotle, and she came up from the landscape.
And it goes to come to the way to get the land under its feet under its feet.
He knew that we have a one thing to do that point and it was words like a morn."
And it goes to the house and it was following from this poetry, and it would not have to take another piece of paper and a math enough to take a card and a math and it goes to to the page on the page.
Sometimes you can't be enough as quickly as it goes and correct and correct and correct and correct and the rotoled her and the rotoled her and and then she was going to rotolar through the landscape, as he said, "another poet."
And then there were those times -- this piece of not going to be -- and there were a moments where the was almost lost of the moments that was almost loss?
So, it was trying to go home and was trying to card and the car, and he was actually going to go through a degree in the time when he was in the wasting and and the off.
He was the tail of the tail and reput it in his body and the released in his body, and he was going to the page.
And in these cases, the poetry is going to be on the perfect page, but at the contrary of the last word at the last word of the first word at the first one of the last word of the first word of the last worth of the last worth of the last worth of the last word of the last worth of the first one of the last few of the first one of the first one of the first one of the first time.
So when you feel about it -- it's fairly fairly to my creative process to my creative process of creative.
Not all my creative process.
I'm a mult, and my way to work on the same order, and I can get to work and work and go to the same in the same time.
But even in my head, in my headlinked headlined against that stuff, I was a few times.
And I imagine a lot of you have a lot of you have done.
You know, even if the work work and ideas came to me from a certain source of not that I could not be a lost of it.
And what is this thing?
And how can we relate to us to do not allow us to lose us the head, pluttoster -- that is to stay sanimal to stay sanimal to stay sam?
And so much as I review, the best example of me that I have is musician musician is musicist in Tom Waits, which I interviewed a few years ago for a journeal.
We were talking about this, and you know, Tom, for the majority of life was the incarnation of the artist of the argument of the artist of the arguing of these species of impulsized, and then you know, Tomer er creatives of totally interiored.
But then I agreed it, and a day when she was driving on a cartototoday, in Los Angeles, and it changed all for him.
It was going to go through speed and all a little framework of this little framing of a melodia, which comes in his head, and the inspiration, and the wish -- you know, it's wonderful and the desire -- you know, it's wonderful and the desire -- but it doesn't know how to take it to take it out.
It doesn't have a piece of car, not has a matit; it doesn't have a record record.
So it starts to hear this sort of old anxian old anxian han's for a type of losessioned by this song, and remarrying the song of this lost lossessioned by this kind of persemed by this kind of persemble.
I'm not good and I can't do it and I can't do it."
And instead of going to go to the panic stop.
And he was going to be the entire process and made something completely new thing.
And he just just just the sky and said, "Cus," don't see that I'm driving that?"
"You know, you look like it can write a song of the han?
If you really want to exist, you get to a time when I can take a current of you.
Something to get to to get somewhere else today.
I wanted to disturbing Leonard Cohen."
And his process worked changed after that.
I don't work was a work of the work was still like it.
But the process and the fishing ranger was released when the genius was released when the genius out of himself out of himself and the genius was going to be a forward, and they will relead to where it was not a whole thing.
but it has this peculiar, wonderful bizar, wonderful bizarre in a conversation between Tom and this strange and extended that he was not Tom.
So how much the story that is to change a little bit of a way I was working and I was going to save me a time.
This is a idea, and I was writing when I was writing up to the Prega, Amak," and falls in one of those cave disperation where we all all are working on something and we don't start thinking that will be a desaster ever write that will be a worst book that will be the worst book that is going to be the worth written ever writed.
Not just good at the worst book written book writing.
And I started to think of thrown to the project.
But then I remember Tom I talk about Tom that speaker and try it.
So I got my face in my face, and I would say, and I would say, my comments to a chance of the room.
And he said, "You know, what you know if you know that if this book is not going to be a bad isn't going to be a milk, right?
Because as I see that I'm going to put all of this.
So if you want to be better and you have to get your parts.
Okay. But if you don't know it, you know, I don't know it is nothing.
I'm going to write the same because it's my work.
And I'd like to be a for favor that I was a story about my parte" because -- the end is in the desers of the North Africa -- sitting in the deserts of Africa in the deserts of the North Africa and music, and music, and music, and music, and music, and music, and music, and the sacting to the tree.
And they were always magnificent that because the ballers were fantastic professionals, and they were fantastic.
But every one of them would be doing it, and a of these artists became actually translate in a transmitant recept.
And I know what I know about what I know is that you have seen everyone to a certain point, a lost point.
It was like the time is stopped and the ballery walk through a kind of laps and didn't do anything different from the sun, as the 1,000 notes -- but all you get it to the sun.
And suddenly not just like a human being.
But you have access to die in the device.
And when this next time was in the temples, people knew what it was, was, it was called his name.
They were the hands and started to cant, "Allah, Allah, Allah, God God."
That's what I did, you know it.
And he was a nice named -- when the Morders invader of Spaper per per in the Spaper and reading it changed in the century of the seats of "Wah, y" to "You know, y" in the corride or in the corries or in the corrids or in the corride or in the flam.
In Spay, when a artist has done something impossible and magic -- "Allah, black it, Allah, magnificent -- a little bit of a God.
And it's great because we need it.
But the problem comes the problem comes back to the ballery in the same, when you swewing and discovers that are the 11 in the morning, and the last of Dod is not more.
It's just a death with a great male of the kneed, and maybe not can be able to each other, and maybe not can be able to each other.
And maybe nobody cancer, it's going to be on and what has to do with the rest of his lives?
It's hard to be difficult to it.
This is one of the most pain to do in a life in a creative life.
But maybe it doesn't have to be so angotitis-up if you can not believe it, it doesn't believe it, and the most extraordinary of your being from you to be so that you are in the way to be so angod.
But it creates you just get to the data in prester of this team of the foundation of your life that you have to get anyone one other when you find.
And, you know, if we think about this change.
And so I started thinking about it, and it's because it's really as a way I thought for different months during the work of the book that audience for a book that a public period of the great success.
And what I have to continue to say when I feel elevent me to be in this is, not to be the land.
Not just just just your job.
It is to presents for your parts, any of your parts, any of it.
If your work is ball, ball, it is.
If the devent device, if I had a decide of leaving some kind of wonderful for a few kinds of wonderful for a moment through your own own your spring!"
Something to the same your dance.
And "Oh, y!" And I said, "You know,
I think I think I should have to teach it.
"Yes!" at the samor in the human beings and testing, and the tagine headaches to be a representing to you continue to be a continuously.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
As you know I've been talking about some of these projects on the human genome on what can mean, and what can mean, and the discovered of new genes.
We're starting to a new permanmany, we started digitalizing biology and now now to leave the digital code we are in a new fashioning and sintetizing and sintetizing life.
We always tried to take a great questions.
"What is the victim?" is something that many biological I think they have tried to understand a var levels.
We tried different approach, reducing for minimmers.
We're digitalizing for almost 20 years old.
When we sequenced the human genome was treated by the world of biology in the digital world of the digital digital world.
Now we can regenerate the life, or to create life, or new life from this digital univer?
This is the map of a little organism, the Mycoplasma genitalium, which is the species from genome of the genome of the most of those that can authorate in lab in lab laboratory.
And we tried to reduce the genome for creating a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit
We can get to eliminate a centinaid of about 500 of the genes of about 500 of the one of the 500 of the one of the 500 of the genes of about 500 of the genes of about 500 of the genes of about 500 of the genes of about 500 of the genes of the genes of the about 500 of the genes of the genes of the 500 of the genes of
But when we take a chock at its map of metabolic map of the nostrength.
I think this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes we can eliminate it, it's very unlikely to get a viventure.
So we decided that the only way to progression to progressive this cromosome, so that it was to make the waving components to make the components to take some of these questions.
And so we started the way the "Can we can synthetizing a chromost?"
Can an you feel about to produce these great molecules that we never can make these great molecules that we never can create before you get to the earth?
And, in case of a provide we can make a chromost?
A chromosomes is just a piece of chemical material.
The speed with which we can digitalive life is growing up to the life is growing to exponential.
Our ability to write the genetic code, invectively slowly, but it's better.
And our most recently resulted the door resultancy exponential.
We started more than 15 years ago.
The process has required a lot of passing with a bioetic revision before we started with the early experiments.
But we found that synthetizing DNA is very difficult to be very difficult to be a very difficult thing.
There are decade of thousands of cars in the world that make little segment of DNA, the longer of 30 to 50 letters and is a degenerative process is longer than the segment is longer longer than the segment is longer than the chance of the world that are there.
So we had to develop a new method, to make these framatic frams and reaching the mistakes.
And this was our first attempt for the digital genome of the Phi TThi 174.
It's a little virus that kills bacteria kills
We designed the framments, effectively reported the reporting mistakers and get a molecule.
The interesting part of this is when we took this piece of chemical material chemical material and we put it into the bacteria started reading this genetic code. And then they started reading this genetic code.
The virals are then released by the cell phone came back and they come back and they have destroyed Es.
I talked about recent with members of the petrolifes that they are certainly comfortable to this model.
They have more than you.
We think this is a situation where software can really build his own own own its same hardware in a biological system.
But we wanted to do the biggest things in the greatest thing.
We wanted to build the entire chromosoms of the bacteria
It's more than 580 miles of genetic code.
So we thought we built it in the middle of the virus, so that we can change the cassets to figure out what the components of a viviral cell of a viventure of a viviventure of the viviral viruses.
The projection is crucial and if we start with digital information in a computer, these have to be very accurate it.
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 accuratess was a standard of a mistake for every 10 miles a few miles up.
We have discovered that, 30 mistakes. If we had that original sequence that original sequence will be able to be able to do it work.
A lot of the process is designing segment segment segain to the other segan in the other other segment of 50 letters to build in the other segment of the work together.
We have a lot of one of the uncles here.
You probably have a little bit that we put us of the flight.
Think of this is, we have a genetic code.
To of those letters put together together codifice about 20 love love minoid and there's a specific order to reading for every love for every love of the letters for every love of the laptop.
So we can use genetic code, to write words, fraise --
What we did in the beginning was authography.
Some were dolphins were dolphins from the fact that it was not a poet.
We designed these segments for a few of them just just to get them with a feet
There are both improof them and they put them up and put them up.
And we started to get to the parts, starting, starting with a five to seven miles in a letter to be able to forming segments in a way to make sitting in 72 miles to the literal 1777, the literal liter.
And every past we have produced these sitting in a little segmental so that we are trying to create a very robate proception of the extreme in a very robute of the sum.
We're trying to automatization the process.
So, this looks like the tabellone of a basket.
When we get to these very long century, more than 100 miles -- more than 100 miles are not going to grow it in E.
You get to the limits of modern biology of molecular biology of molecular biology.
So we have considered other mechanism.
We know about another mechanism called a homology, which in biology is that in biology is useful to repair the DNA to repair the DNA to be able to unive the DNA to be able to unique.
Here's an example.
This organism, this organism, called Deinococcus radiohars, can make three million radiation.
You can see in the ground.
In 12 -- 24 hours comes up as a before.
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do it.
These organisms can be able to be completely.
They can live under a tough.
I'm absolutely sure that life existing in space, and you get slow up to find new environments of water.
And he was the NASA showed that this avail.
This is a picture of the molecules we built these approach, just using these approximating, just using the design of the design of the remarkable segment of the segment of inserious segments from inserious segments to inserious chapter with the design of the represent.
The liver, resembling them out the automatically.
This is not been taken with a microscope with a electrotrotro-scope microscope regular microscope regular microscope regular microscope regular microscope of regular regular microscope regule.
It's a molecules that is so great that we can see it with a microscope with a microscope of law.
These are photos that they cover a period of about six seconds.
This is the advertitilent we did a little time ago.
It's more than 580,000 letters of code.
It's the most great great of a definitely definitely ever created by man.
It has a fisher to 300 million a million in the milk of 300 million people.
If we stamed with a cart to 10 without spaces, they would like 142 pages to just to get this genetic code.
Now, how do we work work? How can we do that?
Of course, you get a virus is a guy from a guy from a girls.
It's a little more complicated when they use bacteria
It's simplest when it's a very simple cellular cells as our ourselves, you can just extreme the nuclear and inserird a few else, which is basically the process of clonation.
In the bacteria the chromosome, it's integrated inside the cell cell but we recently showed that we are able to do a complete trailing trailing a cell of a cell cell to another and activity of activity to it.
We can refliked a chromosomed by a microbial special of a microbial microbial romosome.
The two are different as men from topis.
We added some gene in more in a way to decide what you can decide what you can decide that chromoon.
And then it has the cholold, with the income to kill all the proteins.
And when we put it in the cell was stupending on -- and you appreciate our graphic graphic despite -- the new chromosomed it has gone into the cell cell cell in the cell cell phone has gone into the cell cell cell phone of the cell -- and you can appreciate our graph.
And we were really thought we couldn't go down to the time, but we tried to be a lot of permanman.
This is one of the mection of evolution.
We found that very much species have added a second or a third or a third a third of a few parts, adding in a second thousands of trates.
So who think about evolution as a only gene to the time that you have no understanding of the biologist.
There's an injury called "restriping is that allow low to be that right right now.
The chromosomes that was in the cell is not a one.
The cell phone, the cell that we have inserito-tail.
It's expressed the other hand has recognized the other chromosome, it has masticked up and we were revolved with just cell and the new cooking.
It's become blue because of the genes that we have inserable.
And in a short lash of time, all the characteristics of a kind of a lost of the whole new software that in a new software that we insered in a new software we insered in the cell cell phone.
All the proteins are changed, members are changed, and when we read the genetic code.
Now, this may seem to genetic alchemy -- but you can change the software can change things in a pretty substantial.
Now, I already explaned that you don't talk about genesis -- but of progress from three million and a half million and a half and a half million and a half of Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosion of this digital process.
Why do I do that?
I think it's obvious, when we think of our need to be our need to be in our necessity.
We're going to go to six billion and a half billion people in the next 40 years.
Just for an example: I had been born in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for each existing in 1946; in 40 years, there will be a quack.
We're now doing this problems now to find out the water and clean inal drugs and bed damages for six billion people.
It's going to be more hard to do it for a billion
We use more than five billion carbon diox, more than 30 billion boils.
That means a million barrels to the day.
When we try to find biological approach, or any kind of process to rempiring them, will be a huge challenge to it.
And in the more we have to get all the courage of CO2 from these materials that end up in the atmosphere.
On the day, because of scientific discoveries in the world, we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I like to think that they are the components for the future.
The electric industry is just a dozen about a dozen and think about how many things are several comes.
Our limits here are data in the biological reality and from our imagination.
Now we have a techniques of techniques of synthetization, can we make what we call a combinator.
We can build a big robot that can produce a million chromosomes a million chromosomes a day.
Think of process. Think of these 20 million genes or to try to get the approach to prove the processes or drugs, we can change and change a little theam, and we can change molecular biology now that in the last 20 years of science.
And it's just a standard selection.
We can choose for chance to survive, production or carburants, producing of glass.
This is an instantant instantly of software programmed about that we're working for being able to be able to sit and designing species to the computer.
Well, we don't know how it will be year.
We know exactly how their genetic code.
We're now focusing on the coal carbons of fourth generation.
You also see you have seen that you can get to ethanol is a male experiment in the male experiment was a mous.
We have carbon on on the third generation that will use enough to use as a carbon die of the higher of the higher of the highest degrees of like either eight of different types of thrown as a little bit of the higher than they will use a lot of different types of the higher than they will use it as much as the eight of the higher than they will use it as a few of the higher than they are going to be a lot of the higher than they will use of the higher than the higher than the higher than the higher than the high
But the only way biology can have a great impacts of food and more and limited the cost of food and limited the cost of the food and consistent is going to transform the CO2 in material that we are working for designing cells that can reach this purpose in about 18 months.
The sunlight just combined with the CO2 is a metodog -- but in our discoveries in our discoveries in the world, we found different metoes.
This is a organism we have descripted in 1996.
It lives in the deepest of the deep, about 2500 feet of the water.
They create metate by CO2 using hydrogen molecular as a source of energy.
We're trying to figure out if we can actually be able to get the CO2, which can easily be transported to the CO2 in carbon tub, to drive this process.
So we think about a short we could be able to increase what the question of "What is the victims of the question of "What is the victims is the victims of re-to-raise interest industry.
Exactly. If you can't do it from TED, where you can do it from TED, where you can do that?
It would be a main of energy.
And then we are working for the same metods to use the same metods to create vaccines to create vaccines in the mind.
You have seen this year with influence, we're always going to get a year and a dollar in less when it's about to find the right vaccine right now.
I think that what you can change in a combinable to be able to be a vaccine in antical.
That's how the future could start seem to be changing, now, the tree of evolution, accelling evolution with bacteria -- and indefinitional cells and indefinitely cells -- and indefinitely cells --
We are so so much from getting people.
Our purpose is to do in a way of live enough to try to try to try to do it. Thank you very much.
First of all you will have to see the most rapidly possible, a few days, the new technology that we have to the Microsoft in following a year of a year ago ago is Seadragon.
It's about a environment where you can interact is at the local level that remote with a huge amount of data on visual data.
Here we're seeing a lot of gigabygen photos with a digital photos with a kind of a lot of a speaker and continues, for a little bit like we want.
And not importantly how much of information that we see how much of information that we see how big these things are going to be the data or images.
Most is a digital photographs of digital photographs, but this for example is a properly from the Bible library, and reenter in the legal legs of the Congress,
It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that limits prestations of a system like this is the number of pixels on your screen in any moment. It's also a very flexible architecture in any time.
This is a book of data not images.
This is the Dickens. Every desolated Dickens. Every colonna represents a capitulo.
To to show you that is just about head, and not imagines, we can do something like this, to see really really that it's a representation of the head, not of a frame.
It could be a little artificial to read a little artificial book.
It doesn't really add it.
This is a more realistic example of the First Guardian.
Every very big image is the beginning of a century.
And it really takes you to be the beauty of the life-ver, version of a review of a review or a fair, which is for nature a few of a few of meeting of a few of meeting.
We also did something with the corner of this number in particularly of the Car Guardian.
We created a fashired resolution to solve solution -- much more than that you use in a normal commercial advertis-translate content -- and we put in the middle of the content content -- and we put it in a normal content --
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile goles.
Or other models, or even the specific specific phrases.
And this really demonstrates some of these ideas to helimine on the screen.
We hope that this lemisphere to put a little b-pop-up and other porcheries in other porcheries to be necessary.
Of course, the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of of technology.
And on this is not going to lose time, if you don't know that we have contributing to give it in this came.
These are all the streets in the United States in the U.S. has a geost image of NASA.
So now we're going to go to something else.
This is actually from the vision of the webs; you can go to see it.
It's a project called Photosynth, which fights two different technologies.
A is a Seadragon and the other is a very interesting visual computer face, a very interesting factural computer student, a student of the University of Washington, with the help of Steve Seitz Up Microsoft Szelii of Microsoft Szelii Microsoft Szelii Microsoft Szelii of is a very interesting visual research in the Nah Szelii of Microsoft Szeliski
And it's from the vision on the Web, managed by Seadragon.
You can see it when we do this kind of pattern, where we can go from a picture of the other and have this kind of experience in the other way, we can see this kind of deal with the multiple.
But the space collapse of the images here has actually a meaning.
The tregorits, the computer computer has been recorded these images together, so that they are reacted to the reacts in which reacts of the reacts of the reacts of the Clags -- they have been taken on the Worrases -- they have been taken in the electric of a slide-stable slide-stable degree and these things are all the space.
I don't know if I have time to show you some other environment.
There are a lot more spaces.
I want to go directly to one of the Noah's original data -- and this prototype of proto-type of Photosynth that we did work for the first time -- to show you what I think is really the surface of the extra spacecraft of this technology, Photosynth. And it's really the environment, and it's not necessarily looking at the environment.
We had to worry about the legal aspects and so forth.
This is a reconstruction of the Noth Dame images Flickr. Basta Flickr in Flickr in Flickr and you get images of types in the Flickr and you get images of represents in the field and the represents represented to this model.
So I'm all images from Flickr and have been all connected to this way.
And it's possible to navigate in this simple way.
You know, I would never have thought of finish to work for Microsoft.
It's very fresh fresh to get this kind of of acves.
I think you can see that it's a lot of different types of framework from those phones to those of the SLR, a number of meanings, a number of meanings, put together in this environment.
And if you can get to try to look at those more stranges.
Many are block to face.
Some of a picture is a series of photographs -- there is a series of photographs.
This is a poster of Notretacked correctly.
We can go from the poster of the physics of this environment.
The essential point is we can do some things with the social environment. This is now taking data from everyone one of the things that is now to be able to be a collective of how to be able to see this data together.
All those photos become linked together, more and the summer.
You have a model of the land of the land that emerges.
Think about this as a promotory of work of Stephen Lawler on Earth virtual virtual on Earth virtual virtual on Earth virtual virtual
It's something that growth in complex as a sexual and the people who use it for the uses of uses to increase with use.
Their photos are hinsers by other people.
If you get the idea of contrast to all these sants say my names -- my photo the Notre-Dame of Nots Dame of all those dates, and I can use as a point of these data data -- and I can use the point in the space, in that metaphor to me in that metaphors of anyone else, and have a social experiences.
Of course, a consequence of all of the most extreme elaborate of every interesting part of the earth, you don't just just see the airplanes and from satellitaries and satellitaries and satellitaries and satellitaries and satellitaries and from the collective.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I understood what your software are you going to do is to do is to do is to be doing is that at a certain point, in the next few years, all the pictures that you have together?
Book. Yeah. That's actually doing it is actually discover it.
It's a saving of hyperlink, if you want to be a image.
And it's doing it in the content of the images.
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the richness of the seedity of the several information.
As a research of images on the Web, you know, a sentence and testing on the page, in the page of the picture.
Now, what happens if that picture is to all your photos,
So the amount of interconnection and the amount of resemantly and the amount of recicis' remarkable to be a real red.
CA: Blaise, it's really incredible.
BA: Thank you very much.
One of the main the lost when you travel and a deliptie of research ethnographic research is to live between who doesn't forget in the summer, in the wind waves in the wind waves in the waves of the pietry, the leaves of the pletnoise of the pletnoids and plants.
You know, the monkeys to think that the monkeys traveling still over the Milky Lattea, or that the mites of Inuit is still colate in Himalaya, the budged the respider of Dharm British Dharm is to remind the world of the world that we live in the reality, but it's a sense of reality of reality, but it's a model of reality, but it's a reality of reality.
The consequence of a particular set of adapted choices that our stirs has done, very well or a male of a lot of generations ago.
And, of course, we all share are the essential track.
We all hidden we all red.
We are subjects to reside.
We have to deal with the death of death -- so we don't surprise and whalliam.
We all have a art.
What it is the particular range is the particular race of the canzone, the race of every culture.
Not important, they are the forest of the Borneo, or the following of the Haiti, or the Haiti, or the Curantural desert in Kenya secentonal in Kenya in the heart of the Saa.
He was my company in the desert in the desert a month ago, or a month ago, or a dyet of the names of the names of the name, on Everest, the deal of the world.
All of these people teach us that there are other ways of thinking about existing other ways of thinking, other ways of moving in the world.
And, if you reflects a tim, is a concept that can give you hope.
Insides, the mirration of cultures of the world creating a spiritual and cultural cultural and cultural cultural and cultural cultural and is important for the planet as the planet as the planet as the planet as a biosphones.
And you can think about this ragnant as a hetnosphers' ethnosfer and you can call the ethnos; it was the subjectory of all the conceptions of the human imagination, inspirations, intuitions of the consciously.
The etnosfer is the fantastic human human manity.
It's the symboll of what we can be in how much inquisitive.
And because the biospher's had been very much as a loved as a very much as it has happened to the ethnos;
Not biology, for example, would say that 50 percent of all the species has been or on the summer, just because it's just failed because it's a failed or -- in the expocket -- in the biological diversity -- and you don't have a little bit of the diversity -- that of the diversity of cultural ipotential -- that of cultural diversity cultural diversity.
The indicate of all of course, is the language of language.
When you're bored 6,000 lings, there was 6,000 English on this planet.
A language is not just a vocabulary of a series of grammatics.
A language is the human spirit of human spirit is the human spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of human spirit is the human spirit.
It's the half of the animation of every culture.
Every language is a forest of the mind, a soul chance of spiritual chance of spiritual chance of spiritual chance of spiritual chance.
And of those 6,000 languages, as we are sitting in Monterey, at least half is not more sushed in the orecches of children.
They don't get to the children, the kids, which means not to be a death.
What is a more trister than being the silench of being the last to talk about a language to talk a language, of not that we have a way to put the site of the hang of the children?
This is a few weeks of someone in some part of the world every two weeks a little bit of a few weeks a hush and door and door and a sun language of a language of a language of a language of a language of an anticically.
And I know that anyone of you will tell you about this?
The world would not be a better place if we were all the same language of the same language -- we all talk about the yoruba. We all all yoruba. We all all have a cantony.
We talk about kogies.
You will be a track, which means we can't talk to not talk to not talk to the language.
I would like to do a journey through the etnosfera's ethnosfer.
a little journey in the etnospher's ethnos' ethnos;
Many of us of us forget that when I say, "different ways of exist" -- I really do a different ways of exist.
We take for example, this mb Barasana, in Amazony secentriony, the popular of anacony, which creates the mit of the anacony of the llate of the sea penter of the sepenters of the sepents.
It's a popular that is not able to distinguish the blue color blue because the celests is identified in the forest of the forest, which is identifified in the forest of the forest, which is identified in the forest blue color.
They have a strange language and a matrimonial, called """Hamia language -- you have to get a person that talks a different language.
All of this has been rooted in the past-scale is that in these exestors in these exestors where they talk about six or seven seven lings, the mysteries in the middle of the mysters in the middle of the mysteries in which is a single language.
They are just listening and then they start talking about.
We take one of the more interesting tribes with the Waorans that I lived Waorans of Ecuador noritoral tribes that had the first contatts in 1958.
In 1957 mission have tried to a committing mistake.
They did it from the high photographs that they would reach them in a few that they were reporting loss' lives that this popular of plural viral viral viral bi-dimensional raissued in a few dimensional dimensional dimensional dimensional pluum.
They have a picture of the photos from the ground, they have been doing a form or a flower and not to find swimming that was the diavold, and they killed the beleleled with the les.
But Waorans don't just kill the stranimal stranies.
They have to be in their own of them.
54 percent of the death was caused to their stessi.

All culture through culture in the central sees have been involved in a new way of life.
And the problem is not technology.
The Indian Sioux is not being Sioux when they put it from the arm and fresh and fresh so as Americans have no being Americans have been in the horse and calculate it.

Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope you have heard and I'll be able to denise some links in the case, in the case not notaste.
I would like to start with what I call "the official."
The official official of what?
The official dogal society of all the industrial society industry in the official official official society is to be our city, to do is to be a healthy of our citizen."
The reason is -- from a late, in fact, in the fact that the liberty is in the same value, and essential for humans.
On the other is in the fact that if we are free, each of us can act for all of us to do all that that mass our benefit without any deciding in the name of our.
The way to massive way to be freedom is to be a choice.
The people are fresh people are free, and more and more and more and more and more and the freedom, more and the benefit is their freedom.
This is a re-deeply is so deeply in society that nobody would be dreamed to put it in doubs.
And it's also deeply rooted in our lives.
I'll show you some examples of what progress has recovered as possible.
This is my supermarket. It's not particularly great.
I lost a simple note on the conditional conditional conditional conditional conditional conditional conditional conditional conditional conditional conditional conditional conditional conditional conditional conditional conditional conditional conditional conditional condition.
In my supermarket is 175 conditions, without the 10 variety of the extracts of the extracts and 12 acets, you can buy for a huge number of balance that you can buy a huge number of constance that nobody of the 175 already already is of your degree of our degrees of your degree of your degree.
That's what the supermarket.
Then you go to the uncle of electronic stand to buy a stere: cassroom, brought up the CD, radio, plast, bons.
And in this single story.
We can make six million different combinations using the components that there are in a only one negoties.
You have to put that there's a lot of choices.
Some of the world of communications.
One time, when I was a kid to get all the service of telephones, to pat the mothers of mothers wish services from mammals Bell.
It was born the phon; you don't buy it.
A consequence of that, in the other, was that telephone is not rompies.
These are the time they went in.
So we have a lot of nearly illited phone, especially between cells.
Here is the future.
My favorite is in a half a MP3, cut down the nose of the nose of the nose of the nose of the crashes of the crashion.
If you don't have seen it in the store, you're not seen in the case, you're very very well certain that I will get to it.
And what the end is the end of people in the negods and does this question and does this question and does this question and does this question is "No."
It's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn't do too much things.
So, in other aspects of life that are much more important than the water, is that the same explosion of choices.
Assistence -- not happens in the United States you get from the doctors and the doctors of dramework that you have to do.
I went to the doctor, and the doctor, say, "OK, we could do -- "B" -- you could do -- "B" -- "B" is these benefit" and these risks. What do you want to do you to do that?"
You know, "Dr. Dots, what should I do about that?"
And the doctors says, "A has these benefits, and they said, "British is these benefit."
"What do you want to do that?"
And you rebate "Dr. if she was me, what do you do that?"
And the doctor: "But I'm not le."
The result of the malato," expression that makes it look like a beautiful thing.
But actually it's not a sent to the fish and responsibility of taking decisions from someone who knows something, and it's a doctor, to somewhere it doesn't know -- and almost almost almost obviously is maled -- and so not in the conditional decisions for the patient.
There's a huge marketing marketing products of drugs, direct to people like me and you think that if you think not any sense, we can't buy it.
But if we can't buy them, because they can buy them because they have public public public public for them.
The answer is that they want to do it for the doctor, to ask us to change us to change us to change the recivent of the reject.
And so that is that that is our identity is our identity is a question of choice, as you see in this vign. We don't want to be the children. We don't want to be the right right now, we don't know more an identity." We don't have to invent.
And we can reinvention us how much much a grade.
The one morning, in the risk, you have to decide that kind of person wants to be a person want.
And I really, in the family and the main the main despite perspective, so it was that there was a lot of the most prestantly as it was as possible, and it was going to get the most prescription.
The only real choice was with chemist, not what do you do later.
On day, all of course, it's really to play in.
I mean, at a very smart to student, and they are 20 percent in less than a time of work than a time.
And not because they are not doubling because they are not deligents.
but why are they impend on the encounters, I would have to be able to do this right right now.
"Would I have to have to be thinking before the children or to carrier?
They're a loved love.
And they try to answer these questions, even if this implement, not to get a complete company and not to get a bel of my exame.
And they have to do it. I'm very important.
Now, the job: we're lucky, like Carl undertolineavy, because technology allows us to work every single single single angle of the planet, from every single angle of the planet, from the Hotel Randandolph.
To parently -- there's a corner and not to say anybody body else where the WiFi works.
I don't tell you because I want to use it.
What means, this incredible freedom of choice that we have about the work work on the job? Is it we have to work in every moment, if we have to work or not.
We can go to see our son toy playing to calculate in a cell cell in a cell cell and the night, and the tebook, typically on the kneneed.
And even if they all are spectivtively spring, we also see our son rowing the head, we are also asking to this call?"
"Do I want to answer this email? I have to get this liter?"
And even when the answer is "no" is the experience of your headline of your son son is a very different than what it would be in other conditions.
So, we look at the little bit of the big and big, things and stils of life, life is a question of choices.
Of the world was this: Ovely there were some chance, but not all was a question of choice.
The world today is a little bit like this. The dilemma is a positive thing --
The answer is a lot of it.
The positive lens we all know about the negative of those negative negative people.
All this choice is two behaviors in two effects of the people.
The first parados' worth is that producing is that freation.
With many options between the way to get it very hard to do it.
I offer a meaningful example of a meaning-fly on the planets.
A linked up to the data of Vang Vanguard, the gigant, a giant society of depension, with about a million clients in 2,000 different companies.
What she found is that for every 10 solutions that are offered in more, the percentage of airplanes that are on the airline of 24 percent.
With 50 sources are about about five percent of respect than adesions at when they are available to only 5. Why?
Because with 50 founder than the ones that are cheap to decide and choice is to decide and choice is to the question.
And at the question, and I still ask questions, and of course, questions, and of course, questions, not it gets up.
You know, not just mean that it doesn't mean that these work work for the old hanks because they don't have enough money, to say that the decision is so obsticle of the data that even the function of the data.
Not speakers are losing until 5,000 dollars for the data, they are lost of the data, which would be a lot of a verse.
So the paralysis is a consequence of having too much choices.
And I think it makes the world like this.
"And finally finally for the ethchchup, senaps or a maining or main?"
You should be taking the right decision of the right decision -- if it's for the eterness, right?
You don't want to take the wrong of the wrong founded the wrong condition.
So this is the first effect.
And this for different reasons.
One of these is that with many conditional conditional conditional conditions, if you buy a and not perfect a different choice and not perfect a different choice that you could have been better than the alternative imagined us to be better imaged to the construction of choice, and rempiant the repair, and rempiant repuses the remaintaining of the re-re-induced re-re-induced re-re-
even when it was a good decision.
And then you know, more choices are so easy to any detail of any details that is insodly insecent of choice.
And then there's what economists call it economists call it cost-opportunity.
Dan Gilbert has a very well stamp as the value of things we get to the things that we get to the things that we confronti.
Del really, when there are so so many options as possible, is easy to be the features, and being less of the option of the option that you have choice.
Here's an example. I have all the people who are not in New York.
But that's what you probably think about it.
There's this copy to the Hamptons.
A place of the lush place.
It splendid. Ottim day.
Not a lot of people. But what he thinks is, "Well, malediition, is Ago."
"All my neighbors to Manhattan is vi."
"I could talk about front of home."
And then two weeks and put it from the idea that is lost -- every day -- the chance of parking where you want.
The cost opportunity to defeness for what we have, even when the choice was excited.
And more are the options we have to look at the most characteristics are going to be able to be able to be able to be as a constantly checking on opportunity.
Here's another example.
This vivivision tells us a lot of things.
It talks about the living the moment, and maybe of the live slow.
But the most important point is that you choice, you have to get your hair to not do the other.
The things we don't choose to these attactive acties that can make less attactive what we do.
Third point, the spiral growing of waite.
I tried to my skins buy a new jeans.
And it's always jeans.
And once the jeans were a type of just bought them and they were bested by besty, they were comodisodes, just after they were getting a lot of times, they started going to go.
So, I went to buy a couple of new when the old glass were gone, and said, "You need a couple of jeans, this is my cutted."
He said, "Li wants to be slightly fit, relaxed -- relaxed -- relaxed --
You want to be with the circle of the botts? "Stonehed" or "acidd" or "acid" or "acidd?
"Who wants to be a lot of one?"
"Well it wants to be a close or close to the bla." He was going to be elencar.
I was skid, and after a little bit of a while, I want the kind of -- that was the only guy -- that was the only one of the guy who was so so for the time to me all the '0s, then I went out to all the time.
It was the mas. I had the choice of the choice I had the better.
But I felt a worse.
Why? I wrote a book to understand it.
The reason I was worst worst is that with all the choice was the choice were waiting for my waiting for the same time.
I was waited to wait for me. I didn't expect to me about a type when it was just a type of a type when I live 100 different places, at least a little bit of a perfect had to be perfect.
What I had watched was good -- but not perfect perfect it.
After I had paragoned to what I was trying to try to be incomfortable to wait for the waite.
The add of options in life doesn't make the expectation of the people don't get the treatment of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options in the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the op
And this will provide less soddisfation, even when the results are good for them.
Nobody in the marketing world if it makes it content.
Because if you know it would not know what I'm talking about.
The truth of the truth of this.
"You know, it's better when you were worse when you were worse better when you were worse when you were worse to the prevent was still to meet of the presise of the presise of the presise of the presise of the preside-lies of evolutions.
On the world that we live -- opulent industrialized industrialized zens with waiting for the performance -- the massim we can hope is that the things are in the treatment of waiting for the waiting waites.
You never have to be surprise to evolve because your waiting waiting for the waite, you have ingigants.
The secret of happiness -- what you're here -- it's like, "Basit" "Yeah, you want to be way."
I mean, a little moment authographic moment -- which is really smired and my wife is really stupending.
I couldn't do a better, I don't have to do a better, I don't have to be able to do better.
But they don't always get to not always is a good thing.
And finally, a consequence of the buying a couple of jeans -- when there is only that kind of jeans is that when you're not uncoming, and you ask "Why do you don't say, "Why do you ask "Why do you do that?"
"Who is responsi?" "What's the answer is clear to the answer is clear
The world is responsible. What would I do about this?
When there are hundreds of jeans, and you buy a insoddisrently and you ask you who is responsible to you who is responsible for you to ask you who is your responsible for you to be your responsible for you to get a very clear that you are a responsible and you to ask you who is the responsible for you you are your
You could do better.
With hundreds of variety in the available of the succeed.
So when people take decisions, even if the result is valive, they feel income, they feel income, and they get the same.
In the last last few years old, is exploded in the industrialized world.
I think a meaning -- not the uniquest -- not the uniquest of this depression is that people have deludent because the standards are too alone.
And when they have to explain this situation is they think that the colpe.
So the final result is that in general is in a general place, but we feel worse.
Let me tell you about it.
This is the official official dogs, what we all take for good and it's completely fail.
There's no double that a little choice is better than not getting a lot of choice is not going to be that much choice is better than a little choice is better than a few choice is better than a few choice is better than a few choice is better than a few choice is not a few choice is better than a few choice of choice is better than a a few cho
There's a critical value of critical. I don't know what it is.
But I'm pretty sure we have surrounded by a piece of the level that choices better.
Now, from political point of political point -- I have almost finally -- from the noce, the nocle is the follow.
What it allows all this choice in the industrial society is the richness of material.
There are many places in the world, and you know what the problem is not that they have too much choices.
The problem is they have too few of the time.
So the way the factors that I'm talking about is a male-degree of modern modern society that society has eyes.
And what it makes you depress and array is this -- Steve Levitt talked about the beings of how those constent and satages are ineats. It's a money.
I mean, it's not just inutive and dispendioss, it's not just inutive there.
I'm dethleteries.
They make worse worse.
If a little bit of what our societies allows to choice was reversed in those where people have too much choices are too much and it would not just be the nostrength.
This is what economists call it a paretyan improve better.
A recondition redition of the redition is not just to poor the poor -- because of this choice in etc.
To conclude, "Fick, you can become all what you want, "...
Yes, people of culture, thought, "But what makes that fish?"
"It's obvious that you can't get anything in a vetrow of wet."
"A fally" imagination of the world."
and I got a whole thing like this, at the beginning.
But then, I think about it, I realized that that fish.
Because the reality of fact is that if you can get to the melt and the bocky and so that it's possible to be possible to be a good paraly."
If you can stay the bock in a way that all you can delip the soddisfation.
You get the paralysis, and you get the benefit to be the benefit to be a well-being.
They all need a switch.
This is almost certainly too much stret, maybe even for the fish and because of us for us.
But the assumer of some symbolic symbolic recipe for infelicity -- for the rovine.
Thank you very much.
