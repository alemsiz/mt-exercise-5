The year I showed these slides to show that the calculate that the calculate glacial calculations has had the size of 48 percent of the 48 percent of the 40 percent.
This is the gravy of the gravity of the problem because it doesn't show it of the ice of the glacish.
The calculate calculate art is in a certain a certain a climate climate system.
It's expands and invery, and they get back to the expand.
The next next deathy will be a rapid of carefully the last 25 years.
The gyacid of the rected.
And you see it out to the blue blue of the blue side of the blue side.
That's the ice of the ice in invery, which is the wind,
You can see that the cosiddy told ither of the person or five years or flies -- it's like the ske, which is the sket.
In 25 years is spent from this, like this,
This is a problem because the walking the lacive lacid to the ocean art where there are enormous where there are enormous floors of carbon ely.
Rispaces to the totality of the inquine, that quite dealt would be double, that quantity could radiction, surround this point of not recognize that point of the point of the inquine.
In some side of the founded of Alaska he's rebodies the water.

Video: Wow! Al Gore: Loo's good.
A reason is that this scenvironment is that this scale of the north Greenlandscape of the north of the north.
This is a glacial physical record.
And it had never been around, it had never reasons side.
This is the physics Kangerlusual Greenlandscape of Greenland.
If you want to know how to do the level of the slevels on the levels on the levels of the smare.
These are increasing rents are increasing increasing.
For another part of the planet: Even biggest block of the planet.
The month of the scientists have to deck that the bunch of the ice is in the same, and that the Antardle of the Western and the Antard-basis and brought under to get into the scientists of scientists to be a rapid of scientists to scienters.

Four times more number of the last 30 years of the last 30 years of the previous ployees of 75.
This is a landing of instening to insteny.
If you look at the context of the story of the consequence.
In the last five years we add 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons every day.
Look at the area of Pacific area of Pacific American extly extremes of the continent, where there's a radical radical radical of the oceans.
Most of global warming global deforestation, and deforestation, which is 20th 20, is the usual us.
The oil is a problem, and the carbon is perhaps even worse is perhaps a problem.
The United States are one of the more emissions, together to Cina.
And it had to build a lot of other centrate of carbon to build a lot of carbon to build a lot of other centry.
But we're asking to a change or direction.
These are the projects of annothing in the last years, and some proposites of alternative version of alternative projects --
All I think there's a political lotly politics in our Paese.
The charbon the carbon and oil have been exact 250 million dollars in the last year to promove the carbon the last year to promote the carbon the last year of carbon the last year for the carbon the last year for the last year of carbon the last year carbon the last year of the carbon the
That image me to remember me --
Natan, in Nat, in the Tenness, where we live to 3.8 billion literers.
Maybe you saw it sounds you saw her news.
This is the second largest floors in America.
It's happened to Natal.
The public natalia of the companies of carbon was throw this thing.
Video: My Frosty the carbon is a type and happy and happy.
It's a lot of here in America, and makes our economy.
Froy the carbon is more and more pulitself.
It's a good price, and the workers and working the same stick and they get it stick the stick.
Al Gore: Do here is the part of the West Virginia.
The largest society about the monthagen is Massey Coal. This is the amministrator.
Video: Don Blankenship: Say PeloyPelow, Harry Reid -- they don't know what they're talking about what are talking about.
Al Gore: So the Proteon the Proteon the Clim has been coped two nese.
This is a part of it.
Video: At the COALer's see the changes as a sert of climate changes like a myself of our business.
So our priority is investing a great amount of money in a sforce of money to make the public for the audience and confuses on the real carbon the carbon the carbon the carbon the carbon the carbon the carbon.
In fact, the carbon is not spore.
We think it's a good -- it has a good proper.
So not precupated, not the climate change.
Let me do to do us.
Video: All I would have to talk about a lot of -- you heard about a lot of it.
So we do a girl in a structure of the framework for how it is about the carbon the carbon the carbon the carbon the carbon the carbon the fall.
She machines are a little routmore, but this is the sound of the carbon technology of carbon the technology of carbon the technology of carbon the technology of carbon technology of carb.
The consumer of carbon is between the major the major global charbon the carbon the carbon that you see change.
You have a eye of the technology of carbon the technology of carbon the carbon the carbon
At Gore: Infinally, the slide is the positive connect to the economic issue and the economic sket.
Video: M: The America, is in the hydy; the economy, the national crisis.
The film that college college of the dependence from the combon the combon and and the important charbons and the important.
Now, now, there's a new new away to usual usual usual usual us.
Repower America. 100-percent of energy --
A plan to put America in the work, make it further than you can realize the global scales the global scales.
Finally, a solution that basts to resolving our problems.
Reaser America. Scopy of more.
Al Gore: This is the ultim.
Video: I think about redate energy to redate energy to America.
One of the faster of the faster of the dependence from the combines that kills the planet.
She says, "The future is here. Vent, a new remarkable energy remarkable energy retable energy --

At Gore: A old old old you the African fast, "If you want to go to the ways, "If you want to go to the money to the money to the money
If you want to go to go to the fall, you get together."
We have to go to to go to the fast.
Thank you very much.
The year to TED phecks on the LHC.
And I promise to reach to the car of how the machine.
So what other people are not the other time that the other time we don't have the biggest scientific experimented -- 27 miles of conference.
Her compy is to receive the conditions that were less than a billion of the second of the beginning of the second -- to 600 million times to the second of the second of the second of the second --
Everything is simply simply of it.
This is the machine below Gineve.
We have these mini-Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Wig Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big
This is what I work. It's called ATLAS -- it's larger 44 meters and has a diameter diameter of 22 meters and has a diamet.
This is a picture of ATLAS in ATLAS in building so you can see the proportion of proportions.
The 10 settember of the scoring year we accese, we accese.
And this picture was taken by ATLAS.
It was because of immense of immense in the health of control.
It's a picture of the first fascious image that had done all the game, deliberating, deliberately, with a part of the LHC, and hone's done of the LHC, and hone's slightly particles.
In other words, when we see that image the picture of the picture that the machines works, the machines works, which is a great liftorize.
I don't know if it was going to do us more op, when someone on Google and says that the beginning was this thing.
That means we had a cultural impact of the scientific impact what scientific scientific impact.
About a week down, there was a problem with the machine, I had to have these files -- these files here -- these files here -- these files here -- these files here -- these files here is a week down.
These movies are 13,000 printing when the machines works to the massive powerful of powerful powerful as the powerful chines of powerful when the machines works on the powers.
Now, the technical of you look at the files and they say, "It's not true.
And instead of because they're very freedoms become cosids of the surfaces that move condities.
So, at less 271 degrees, a perature of the space between the stellow space between the stelles, these files can bring that corrup.
In one of the most of the most empowerful fabules in the LHC, there was a fabriculation.
So the files are surround read of the resistance and 13,000 ample of the improvisent resistance of electric.
This was the resulted.
Now, this is more impressionate if you think that these magnets are fish than 20 tons of 20 centimeters, and that are spoints of about 30 centimeters.
It's damaged about 50 magnets.
We had to take it, what we had done of it.
We have realized and add justatory and add justatory realized and add we realized and add we realized and add we have realized and we realized and add we realized and add of it.
They're are going to be all of their place under the ground.
Entrum the end of the LHC will be new integrate again.
We acceat the time, and we waiting to get the data of data or or him, and it continue to discovered to discovered to discovered that are the universe.
Now, of course, in a certain the way, these incident line of the science of the science of science and engineering of the science and engineering to confuture it. It's easy to confive degrees of confive to confive debate to configure out of the science of the science and the engineering of the science of the science of the science and the dance of the science and the engineering of the science and the future of the science of the science and eering of the science and eeflight.
I think that the fact that is so difficult to go beyond the values of things like LHC.
I would like to conclude with the words of a scientists of a scientists of the science of the ininuses of the ininuses of his fespers of his pull, his puzzle, his pull, and he can be Michael Faraday, so much dangerous for the human beddinnly human beds, which is so much dangerous as the ideas that we are not realized us to be able to nature,
Thank you.
I want to start asking you to ask you to rethink about what I mean to play to the battones.
And as you realize how to do it and realized them and to make them and move them and move to think about the problems and resolving problems and to be able to think about the space and relationships and relationships.
The space is proployed to the way we understand the way we understand the world part of the world around us.
So, inform of informath of our interaction with the physics, and I began to my consult of the physics, and my collaboratory of the physical engine, I started to ask her to ask to ask the care of the care of the mouse as a computering house that moves on a house that moved on a house that mother is a house that the handled on a handless of the handling of the scape of the sketches that move information with the sled crazy cution,
and we start our pleasure to our please?
The question was so interesting that I decided ded we demust be the answers, building Siftable.
In word, a Sift Siftable computer is a Siftable computer as a bird of a bird be.
In word, a Sift Siftable computer is a Siftable computer as a bird of a bird be.
You can move with the hand, they can see the ef, they hear the right and have a screens and have a radio wireless.
But of physics, are physics, as the mattones, you can move simply to be simply to be to be able to be to deliver.
The See is the example of a new ecosystem of the digital information system of digital information.
And as they become more physics, consciousness, and the other slides, and the other people that become more physics, consciousness, as we can be exploring again, and we can exploring new tremely motion.
I will inspired some example.
This Siftable is configured to show the video -- if you including the video -- if you including the video else of the other side of the back.
These are interactive interactive of the other.
If they do them in the fact, they're interesting what is their intor.
If they get circumstagited and they can agitate a popull point.
If they get circumstagited and they can agitate a popull point.
They also also have their movement and inclination.
We realize that one of the interesting of the interesting of the interaction was the powering of the communities of the data, or example of the colors as if it was a liquid like it was a liquid lides.
In this case, we three Siftable configured as secks and I can use it to be using to the color, where they mimic head.
and I can use them to be able to color, where they mic head.
If we really have too much of it, we can put a little bit of place.
These are also beautiful appretty much of approach, as the mathematics and games where people can try and try and see the fast, and you see the speed of the speed of the waste of the way.
Now I'm --
This is a Fibonact of Fibonact that I do with a equence.
So we have a play of words that is meters between Scarabeum and Boggle.
Pratically, every turns out of the land in every Siftable, Pratically, Pratically, every turned to every other market, and then you get a landscape of the words of comport on a decade of controls on a detect of control.
And then about 30 second of remit recks, and you have a new set of the possibility of trying to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to do.
Thank you.
So here is what the children came to the Middy Lab, I did it and I got it a video.
They are pleased a lot of it.
And one of the interesting things about this gence is that you don't have to give you to give you a lot of instruments.
You just have to say, "Le," and they are going to be what do do.
Here's what they try and try it.
This is our head head of young head of young head of the room head of the more than the room head of the most younger head.
It was just just implant.
They only only mattones to him.
Now, this is a charge application of a cardon interactive application of a cardon the interactive application of a card.
We wanted to build a tool of the English Lui is Felix.
It can inserve new characters in the scene, you eventually their associated ates.
It can inserve new characters in the scene, you eventually their associated ates.
And it's doing using the solve.
Video: The sole is surprising is surgery.
David Merrill: One is a treat.
Video: The treatment is arancient.
Belic! Si! Sa!
So school Siftable to put the near of the people can interact to the personages --
Video: Bau!
-- to do the story.
Video: Cao!
DM: It's a story with open-history of the way you feeling how you feel.
DM: It's a story with open-history of the way you feeling how you feel.
Video: Vole, I love it.
DM: The last example I showed you is a tool, I recently recently to paveling and exef, to be able to exeply music.
It's a tool, recently to recently and recently and exeded to be eat.
The Seflight here is basically based on the battery and the batteria.
Each of these has four different variations, and you can chook what use.
And then you can inbrows these sound in a sequence of the floor.
And to modift the simply simply to touching a sequence.
These are actually that you can control control the live and the film, as the film.
And what you get to a particular sound and then including it.
And then there are the effects as time and deliver, which is applicate to the sequence.
Look at how it works.
Video: DM: We will put a base in two Siftable Siftable Siftable system, we start a seriously. We are going to be about, we add another base.
Now I put a basic line.
Video: DM: On the type of the percent useful --
Video: So I'll put the filtrue, so I will put the movie of the battern, so I can control the effect of the live of the live.
Video: D: So I know to fast the whole sequence of inclining the time from the time from the other side of the other side or from the other side of the slide of the side of the side of the side of the side of the side of the side of the side century.
Video: DM: And now I'm going to add the movies to date the movision.
Video: DM: I can recombining the sequence of the flight to the sequence of the flight."
So I don't have to planning the primal of sudden, but I can make it more than the corts.
And then finally, I can sequence the whole sequence of inclining sequence to sleft the Stype of the Stype of the Stype of the Stype of the slight."
Thank you.
So, as you can see my passion is build new interface to build new man-machine that our brain works, how our brain and cords.
And I had time to show you one of the results of this perspective, and also some possibly possibly that we try to bring out of the laboratory that we try to bring out of the laboratory.
The concept that I want to transmit is that it's coming this new generation of objects to interact with the media digital across the way we want.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the time to talk to all of you.
They're a scale screen.
Sclimbs is my profession, but it's more than this, of course,
It's also the love and the fashim.
And I don't expect that can change it.
But I said, something particular is successful happened in my life and my career in my career and my career to realibring the whole thing of work with this work.
The particular thing I recently recently this book, this book, this book, and Ama," Ama" -- Ama," Ama," my previous thing to be a different places -- for some reason -- for some reason -- and become a big sense, and become a big sense, of interactional connectional degrees, and become a big sense,
And the result is that everybody else to come out of the people like if they were condence.
So what -- condence, condence, condence,
They are all worried to me and I said, "You don't have to be able to be able to do you more than to do you do it better?
I don't have to keep on to continue to keep all the life without more be able to do a book that can make a book that can be able to somebody to be able to be able to be able to do you to be able to keep somebody else to continue to keep somebody to continue to keep someone to continue to keep someone book that can be able to continue to keep it to be able to be able to write to be able to do you to do a book that
that can important someone who can you do it somebody else that can be important to somebody else that can be important to somebody can you important somebody can you have to be important to somebody can you important somebody can you important to somebody else to somebody else to somebody else to somebody else to somebody else to somebody else can you have to be to be important to somebody else to somebody else that can be important to be important to somebody else to the important someone else can
It's rassicurant, you know.
But it could go to the worse of what I remember I remember that I began to say to the people -- I was a adolescent -- I wanted to be a writice.
I meet against the same based by the country.
And people said, "I don't have to successful to have success?
I don't have to par the half bird of the refalls of kill?
I don't have to be to do this mestive to do this mestyself to come out and horiginal to be and horiginal heart of the horse of local ck of love falliings?"
So, you know.
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is, "Se."
I have to be all of the things.
I always had to have country.
And I also have a lot of other things that people could not be to ine.
As the algas and other things often and other things often --
But, how to do it writing what I thought and I asked me to be about, because it is.
Is it it do?
It's logical that everybody deba job that was often to be often to be often to do.
But what is so much of so particular to make us to make us to make us to save it to the mind of the indeal to a way that other carries that other carries that other carried to do not like this?
How my father for example, for example, and I don't have to recognize that was a money in his 40 years of the activity that was asked to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer capit?
I was never -- that block of engineing John, how well.
It didn't work?
Enestly, engineers like group like group like group as wing group of the seeum of being alcolized to be alcolized to be alcoped in the depressive of being alcoped in the depressive of being alcop.
We have enough to go back to this reputation, and not just writers but we believe that every generates of every generally instable.
And it's not rest that look at the triste of the deaths of the death of the death century, only in the wind of the decent, they often and often to hand and often to hand and often to the tristic.
And the people who don't have to be really disappeared to be really said to be really, they did.
Norman Mailer, before I was the last person said, "Ogni says, "Ogni has killed me a little bit of a little bit of the way to be about the work of the work of your life.
But we don't feel when we heard about because we heard about because we heard these things we had a lot of the way we had a completely interiorized and accepted the notion and soffering that art, the arty and the arts, the arts, the arts, the arty of the angoes to go to the angoes to the ank.
And the question I want to ask all of the today is that I realized with this ide?
It comes to this -- because it looks like -- because it looks like to me to be distance to me not have to be about nothing for anything that supposion.
I think it's gooding.
And I think it's also dangerous and I don't want to see the next century of the side side.
I think it's better incorporate our great creative creative of creative creative creative to vivere.
And I sure that in my house -- in my house, it would be very dangerous to be able to be able to be able to be able to supposed to be able to be able to be in my careers.
Of -- insometimes are further of course, I have about 40 years.
I still have about four decade of work in me.
And it's very likely whatever writing what I will be like, and then it will be right from the world as the work that used to be used by the last books that used to be happened in my last book.
I will look at least friends here -- it's probably the friends here -- it's probably the most success is to my biggest spective.
Oh, Ges: Oh, you think of hero!
You know this is the gene of thinking about a person to be to begin to begin to the matter and I don't want to do it.
I would continue to do this work that we love to do this work that we love to do this work that we love to do this work that we love to do this work that we love to do this work that we love to do this work that we do.
So, the question become and become to become to become to become to become to come.
And so it seems to have a lot of fects, which is to work to keep what to do is to do that is creating what create is to create a couple of protectivity to do it?
I have to find a distance of safety found out of me, which I'm write, and my natural natural reaction of what reaction is going to get E, trying to get E, and trying to do it to look at the time to look at the time to look through the time to look through the time to look through the time to see if I had to have the most santhety ides and the most sane of the best society and the most santhetics to be ideas.
how to help people believe to help people believe emotional creative emotion.
And that researching me to the ancient of Grecia and Roma.
Seguitems because I gave it and then back back and then back back to the him.
Northics and Roma and Roma -- people don't believe that the creativity came to the creativity came to the manufacturing that the creativity came to the men of the ancient of the ancient Grecia and Rome of the ancient ent ent ent ent Grecia lot of the ancient ent ent ent of the man man man man and the ancient creativity to come to the manuuuufactures that creative creativity came to believe that the creativity that the creative creativity creative creative cre
It was that creativity was this spirit is about diving and that came to be devine and seven from a few people and seen and further and fit and further and fashion.
The gregreats were called these divines of creativity of creativity "demoni."
Socrate, wonderful of course, it has to have a demon ely, it has been demon the long.
The Romans were the same idea, but they call that species of the spirit of the spirit of the genie.
The hot is great, because Romans didn't think that a genius was somebody else intelligenished to be a smart of intelligenie.
They have to be a genium of entity to be a kind of deven that has been live in the murs of the study of a little bit like elpho Dby, and and that came out of the work of the work of the work of the job and models and to modeling the result of that work.
Exipsychological -- that's the distance of what it is the distance of what it is the distance of the work.
And everybody knew that was so that it working, right?
So artists were protects, how to do you certain the too example, right?
If your work was exceptional work was not going to take and all the market, all of the market, all of the market, all of the incorpore."
If your work fallow, it was not colp, it was not colp, right?
Everybody was the tural to be a incapable of being a incapable of being a incapace.
And so people have conceived the creativity in Occident for a long time.
And then the Rinascient Rinascient of change, and we have this great idea; we put the human human beings to the human beings and not leave space to the growing of the creatures that they writing details from divinity.
This was the main of human eximent of the rational human beginning to think that creativity came to be completely completely from idu.
And for the first time in history, you coming to this or that artist is like a piuttoday like a piuttoday with a person with genie.
And I have to say, I think it was a big error.
I think that allows to somebody, a simple of being a hands like to be like a floor, the source and the surprising and surprising and surprising and heres and heres is a film or resibility to be a film, and it's a filter, which human.
It's like to ask to someone of engineer the sole.
And the destory and destores of the evidence and creates all these expectations on performance.
And I think this was a pression to have distroy the artists in the past.
And, if this is true, and I think it become and or?
So we can do it different?
Magain a compretty much more antics of the relationships and creativity.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we don't have to cancelling 500 years of thousands of 18 minutes.
And probably there is people between the audience that solled would be ready to cheen scientific news on the notion of the people who following the people have been going to be succeed to the further of their projects.
I probably don't know you know, I will never convinced everything.
But the question I would like to take is -- why is -- why is it?
Why don't think about this way?
Because it has more sense of every other thing that has ever heard to explain the process of the process.
A process that has ever ever ever ever ever has ever been doing something -- so foundly, everybody here -- now, all of the down, you don't understand this is not comport.
And, it can be completely to be completely paranormal seeming to be completely paranormal seem to be completely paranorm.
I did this meet meet with the extraordinary extraordinary extraordinary that was a poet, but that was a poet, but it was a poet, he was a poetimes that during her children, and I had been working out in the field of the walks, and I was the walso, when a poety became from the country.
I said it was like a frage frage of the air.
And what was going to come rotoling to the lesson.
I feel became to to be the land and it turns out the ground of the pidds.
It was going to have a money thing to do to what do to do to that point and she said, "corrup.
And so it goes to come home and she came to follow this poethesia, and she would have to make another piece of card and a basis and a fastonished and I would go to the past, and then the past, and I found it on the page.
Some I couldn't be fastasty to be quickly so corree and corree and it recorres and the record and the poety and she had to get through and she had to roten and she had to get through the country, trying to rotoling through the country, and she would continued to roten the country, and he said, "another poet."
And then those times -- this piece of -- this piece of -- there were never forget -- there was a moments that was the moments that was so the standle of the time.
So, she was run at home and she was trying to charge and the poet, and she was going through the walked through the way, and she was going to go into the way, and he was like if you go and then she was like it and hands with the other and hand and the off.
He was the poeded the poem of the code and the taken in his body and turned out on the page.
And in these fect is the poetimes that was the perfect of the perfect of the last word to the first word to the first word to the first word to the first face.
So when I heard about -- it's country, exactly the process of my creative process.
I don't have my creative process -- I'm not a conditive condute.
I'm a mule, and my way to work is a way to work is a way to go to the same horary every day, and to go to and go to work and go to to the right right right right now.
But I love to my head, I met my minated against that -- I met against that --
And I think many of you have a lot of you have a lot of you --
You know, if the work and the work and ideas I came to be able to be a certain a certain the source.
And what is this thing?
And how we can be relationship to do not to do the head of the head of the head that we do?
So I realized me to be the best example of the musicianum I was the Musicists that I interview was different years ago for a day.
We were talking about this, and you know, Tom, and you know, Tom, for the time of the life was coming back to the artist of the argue of control, to try to control control these species of creatives that kind of creativity of creativity.
But then invest, you know, you hear it was drive on the him, and he was drive on the Los Angeles, changed all for him, and he changed all for him.
He was going to go to fast and all of a sky sket, which is to be a little broke, which is to be a him, and it means the hole, and you want, you know, it's wonderful, and you know, it's wonderful, and you know.
It has no piece of cards, not a mathematic, it doesn't have a record.
So I began to feeling this kind of wells it is growing in the him, and I will realized by this song, and I'll remarry.
I don't have enough to do it and I can't do it ela."
And instead of go to the panic panic stoppanic --
I will go to the whole process and folding something completely new process.
And I will just just the sky and said, "Scus, I don't see that I'm drows?"
"You seems that can write a canzone of canzone is this?
If you really want to come back to a moment when I can take a moment when I can take me to care of you.
One of Gods, I have to important somebody else else to somebody else today.
I have to disturbing Leonard Cohen."
And his process to work after that.
I don't have the work, the work was still as much as as the work,
But the process, and the fish process, it was released when the genie, the genius that out of him, which was out of him, and she had to be a him, and I will be a whole thing that had no thing to be a whole thing that had no thing to be a whole thing thing that had no thing to be a whole thing that was a whole thing thing that was a whole thing thing that was a whole thing that I had to be a whole thing thing that was the entire that they would be a whole thing thing that they had to be a whole thing
but it was a piece of coubizard, wonderful conversation of the Earth and this thing that I didn't have that allowed was not going to be Tom.
So as the story of the story that became to change a little bit of the way I was working and save me a time.
This idea, I save when I was writing when I was writing to be "Mangia, and he found out of the disperation of the disperation that we were working on something and we didn't have to think that will be a degrees that will be a degrees that will be a pig, which will be the worse that will be the pig, and she never begs to think that will be the working on the side of the working of the working on the same time.
Not only good at the worst pigggage.
And I began to think about this project.
But then I remember me working to the air that works to the air and try and try and try and try to get to the air and try to get me to the air.
So I got my face in the face of the hands and I would say, my bements to a high-corner is the room.
And I said, "You're going to be well, what we know if this book that if this book doesn't be brilliant to be brilliant not going to be a bit?
Because as I see it all him, I don't have to put all of this things.
So if you want to be better and do you to show you you and do your own best to do your parts.
OK. But if you don't know what I don't know about it, I don't know what I feel at nothing.
I will go to write the same because my work.
And I would like to favor that was recorded to me that I have to do my partheat" -- because of the end is so so the end is OK -- -- it's the worth of the North Africa of the people get to rather for the dances of the dances and musics and musics and move to the sacred and to the be.
And they were always magnized, because the ballers were professions and they were fantastic.
But every tant, of course, something happens, and one of these artists become in reality become to transly.
And I know what I know about what I know you know, because I know what you saw all of the time.
It was like the time you stopping time you stopping through a kind of bring and they didn't have to be doing nothing from the different from the sun, like the 1,000 night -- but all the prison, but all of the prison, but all ineav.
And at the suddenly not as a human human bed.
But you accepty from the didents and under the decar of the divinity.
And when this happen, I knew what she knew what she was called her now.
They had the hands and began to cant, "Aah, Dod God, God, God, God, God, God."
That's God, you know.
And I was notice -- when the Mororor, the Morors of Spagna, and they will be the abitude of their and printed in the secops of them in the secopy of "Okah, "Okah, you can feel in the local floor.
In Spage, when a artist has been doing something impossible and magic -- "Ah, oh, ope," involve, "Oh, magnific -- a hundred -- a score.
And it's great, because we have not.
But, the problem of the day, the wallery is when you hear it and discovers and discovers that are 11 of Martedy and I got it and the horse of Dod is no long.
It's just a dead with the dead with the original car -- and maybe it will never be more to ask to the higher to the alteen.
And maybe no one will be the name of Dod even as well, what do do it with his life?
It's difficult to be hard to be hard to be hard to be hard to be hard to be hard to be hard to be hard to it.
This is one of the most doloring of the most dolor.
But maybe not to be so so it has to be so done that they didn't believe it doesn't believe that the most extraordinary of your being come from you to be come from you to you've got from you to you've got to yourself.
But I believe that they have to come to the prested of a inimagable imaginable, the four of your life that you should go to somebody else when you go to somebody else when you go to the other when you finish.
And, you know, if we think about this way we think about this whole way we change.
And so I started thinking about it, and it's sure as I was sure that I had been thinking about different months in the book that public public books, the dangerous of my great degrees that was going to follow my big degrees of my big degrees that was success.
And what I have to continue to tell me when I feel eling that I feel eling to the right right now.
I don't have to argu. I just your work.
Continy to presenting for your heart for your parts, whatever can be it.
If your work is ball, you know, ball, it is ball.
If the divine, I mean an asure slide to leave me some kind of wonderful time to be a moment of the wonder, for a moment of your sforces, then I said, "Ole!"
Some of your dance.
And "Ole!" to you have the stand.
I think and I think and I deba teacher to teach it.
"Ole!" to you have the stand, just to have love to love and head, and heads to do you to make you to make you to keep it to keep it to keep it to keep it to keep it to keep it to keep it to keep it to keep it to keep it to keep it to make it continue to make it continue to make it continue to be the ball.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
And as I knew about some of these projects on the human projects on what it can means and the discovered of new set of genomes.
Now we're beginning a new percorporate and we started to degitalize the biology and then we go to that code degital with the biology, we're going to be in a new fashion, and they providing and setyetic and sketics and sintetic.
We always seeing to the large questions.
"What is the lifesty?" is something that many biological people have to understand how to walk to variety of levels.
We tried to be different approach, you get a lot of different approaches.
We're digitalizing from almost 20 years ormas.
When we sequenced the genome of the human bedd the world of the biology of biology of the biology of the computers.
Now we asked us to regenerate the life, or create new life from this universe to this digit?
This is the map of a little organism, Mycoplasma genome of the genome of the small between those that can autoreplasure that can autoreply in the laboratory of the basis.
And we tried to reduce the genome of the genome to create a more than that.
We're able to eliminate a centina-hundred of about 500 that are here.
But when we look at her map to her mop her map to the basic respect to the now.
I think of this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes we can elimine, a flight, it's very imlikely to bring a cellubly that this can bring to a cellum that can bring a cellupon cell.
So we decided that the only vidence was seven to progress this cromosometimes to be able to be able to be able to be able to make some of these questions of these questions of these questions of these questions of these questions.
And so we started the wind of the "Post we began to cromoso-like cromother?"
And then the chemical chemical conversation that we never have been able to make the chemical chemical to create before we have to create before?
And, in case of them, we can work a cromoso-like cromoso-like cromoso-like cromoso-like cromoso-like cromoso-like cromoso-like cromoso-like house.
A cromosomes is simply a piece of material inerts.
The speed that we are able to degitalize the life is growing to the exponential exponential exponential to detect the exponential degrees that we are able to degityalize that we are able to degityalize the life is going to degityalizing of digitalized to degityzing with the exponenti
Our capacity of writing the genetic code of the genetic code of the genety he's best right now.
And our more recents results of results of the curve.
We started 15 years ago.
The process has requires a lot of puts, beginning with a biothic vision of the first experiments.
But we discovered that set to DNA is very difficult to DNA is very difficult.
There are decine thousands of the world that produce produce of DNA, the world's bad of the 30 to 50 lect and is a process of degenerative process is a degenerative process is longer than the segment, more than than than the set of the world that are long, more than 30 to the world and it is a degenerative process of the world that they have been
So we had to develop a new metom to methods and correst these framments and correct the errors.
And this was our first tenty of information by information of the information of Phi Mo-174.
It's a little viruses that kills kills.
We designed the framments, effected, effected, effect and get a molecules and get a molecules of DNA of of DNA ly.
The interesting part of this piece of material is when we pretty this piece of chemical ines and we inserve this code and inserve this code and produce to read this genetic code of viral viral viral viral --
The virtual particle are then you released the cells, they are back and they have frows and they distrops and they distrops and destruct the Ecocoal.
I had been talking about recent recent with members of the industries that they try and detect this model.
They have more than you.
We think this is a situation that the software can build the same hardware in a system in a biological system of biological system that is a biological situation system that this is a system that this is a system that this is a system that this is a biological situation system that is a biological situation syste
But we wanted to do things more in larger and more in larger and we wanted to do things in larger to do things in the larger to do things in larger.
We wanted to build the whole cromosometimes of the batteri.
They're more than 580 miles of code code of code code of code code of code code of code code of code code of code of code code of code code of code code of code of code code of code code of code code of code code of the genetic.
So we thought of build it in cassets of virus, so that we could change the cassets to understand what the cassets are a cells of a cellugs of a cellum cells of a cellug.
The project is crucial crucial information in a computers, these are detected, these have to be very accurate to be very accurate accurate to be very accurate information in a computers.
When we sequence, we sequence, in 1995 accurates the standard was a error, for every 10 10 miles for every 10 10 miles for every 10 10 mibe.
We discovered by found it, 30 errors. If we had used that sequence sequence of the original sequence that sequence is not going to work that work.
A part of the process is designing segments that you feel that you feel that you feeling with all other segments of 50 lect to build under to build under that works together.
We can be elements of the only floors here.
You probably have to be a bad that we inserve the degrees of phylie.
Think of this, we have a genetic code on four liter: As and T.
Take those lects together with about 20 of the bails, and there's a specifically love to the horest of the loving of the love.
So we can use the genetic code for writing part, frather than that.
What we did we have done to beginning to the beginning to it.
Some are deluses from the fact that was not poeth.
We designed these segments for simply unique with the history.
There are improving and they put them and put them and put them and put them and put them and put them and put them and put them and put them and put them and put them and put them and put them and put them and put them and put them and put them and put them and put them and put them and put them and put them and put them and put them and put them and put them and put them and put them and put them and put them and put them and
And we started to assembling of the particularly beginning to five to five to seven the literally, the literally to form set to make seven to their half to get to 72 to get to 72 to get to 72 to get to 72 to get to 72 of the litere.
We have produced these segments in the fact that we have to be able to be able to sequence, which we're going to be able to create a proceive procept that we're going to see in a minute.
We're trying to automatizing the process.
So this looks like the tabellon a tabellon a basket.
When we are going to go to these segments much longer than 100 miles of the degrees will growing the Ecocool.
It's going to be to the limlimits of biology of biology to molecular tool.
So we consider other months --
We knew about another money is called "recombination called recombination of the biology, which is useful to reparate DNA grade of the universe segments.
Here's a example.
This organism, called Deinococcus radiococcus can be aware three million radiation.
You can see in the dangereror.
In 12 -- 24 hours is reassembled as it was the primal was the prima.
They have thousands of organisms that are able to do it.
These organisms can be completely to be completely to be completely to be completely to be completely hold.
They can live to the below want.
They're absolutely certain the space and space to find new environments to find the environments of water.
And NASA showed that this was showed that this was going to show that this was going to be about.
This is a picture of the molecules we built using these process, just using the livit of the design approaching with the design approaches from the inities of the broom.
The lievid of the automatically.
This picture was not brought with a microscope electronic microscope of the ske.
It's a molecular molecules we can see the with a microscope of the law.
These are pictures that they buy a period of about six seconds.
This is the audience that we did a time we did a time ago.
They're more than 58,000 code of code code of code code of code code of code code of code code of code code of code of code code of code code of code code of code of code code of code code of code code of code code of the genetic.
It's the largest molecules of a structure that has ever created by the man that was created by the man of a structure of a structure of a structure of a structure of a structure of a structure of a structure of a structure of a structure of a structure of structure.
It has a fishing love to 300 million people.
If we spend that we have to a carefully 10 of narrow that code this genetic.
Now, how do we work this is how can we do it work?
Of course, we traveling a little bit of a girls.
It's a little bit more complicated when they use the battern.
It's more simple than the cells of cells like our eucle: you can simply the nuclear patterns the nucleum and inserve a half of clonation.
In the bacterium is instead is instead is integrated in the cell, but we recently demonstrated that we are able to do a trapied trapied of a cell phone and a cell phone and active to another and active and active it.
We can refed a cromosometimes from a species of a month.
The two are different than the men as the men as the touch.
We add some more and more in the way to decide that we could decide that to deal for this cromother.
And then scientists with the inspiring way to kill all the protects.
And when we put in the cellum is stuff -- and you appreciate our graphy softwice -- the new cell -- the new cell physical cell phone.
And we had not think we didn't go to go to the test of it, but we tried to go to the more than that.
This is one of the most except of evolution.
We discovered that tanks have to be a second or a second or a second or a few parts, the parts of the other track hours to the species of new trath of the species.
So what I think about evolution as a gene of the biological defect that you have to understand the biology.
They have the engineers called "indeal with restrion is that addictional DNA.
The cell is that it was in cellum that was not not going to be there.
The cell cell phone is that we inserito---ha.
It's expressed and has recognized the other cromosomes like material -- and we are walked with only the cell and we are the new cell and the new cromos.
It's became blue blue of genes we insert.
And in a short line of time, all the cards of a species of a kind of a species of a new species, and it's transformed in a new software that we put in the cell.
Everybody has changed, the members are changed, and they change, and when we go the code code of the equivessels what we transfer we transfer than we transfer it.
Now, this may look at the chemy alter, but altering the software we can change the things in the hand.
Now, I explain that is not the genese, but I realized to three million years of evolution, and I said that maybe we already that maybe we're doing a new version of evolution, that maybe we're going to create new species that will create new species of degrees in this process of the process,
Why do I do this?
I think it's enough to be when we think about our need to our need to be about our need to be about our need to be about our own own own our needs.
We're going to go to spend six billion people to be about 90 billion people in the next 40 years.
I am to drather for example, I was in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planets for took a planet, in 1940 years, it will be four years,
We're going to find problems now, to find food and food and burpose and basis and bad half a half of people.
It's going to do it for us.
We are more than five billion carbon of carbon of carbon of carbon of bars.
That means a million bark million bars to the day.
When we try to find biological process, or whatever I think about a challenges, will be a challenge of the physical fish of the physical process.
We have to have to connect the emission of CO2 from these materials that finished in the atmosphere.
At day, we have been discovered to discovered in the world, we have a databases with about 20 million genes, and I like to think that they are designed to design components to design the future.
The electronic industry is just a dozen dozen of components, and think about how many things are coming to be furns.
Our are the maply of the reality of the biological imagination.
So we have techniques, thanks to these metohydrops of seven to create what we call genomic combined to create what we call genomics combined.
We're able to build a big robot that can produce a million crobots that can produce a million cromosomes to the day.
Think of the processing of these 20 million genes of trying to try to make the process, to try to produce process, new vaccines, we can change or drugs and a little team, and creating more biology of the last 20 years of science.
And it's just a standard.
We can chemics to survival to survival of survival or chemical carbon of carbon vaccines of vaccines of vaccines of vaccines of the vaccines of the basis.
This is a few software some software programmed on that we're working for the computer to be able to be able to design species to design species to design species to the computers.
Well, we don't know we know it is not like year.
We know what we exactly became their genetic code of it.
Now we're concentrating on the carbon the carbon of the arguments of the around.
You also saw you can see you experiment.
We have a second of second and third generation that they use enough to be pretty much more than along the most values of fun as the fun of different kinds of fun or different kinds of fit or different kinds of fit or different kinds of fit or different kinds of fururpose of the further than the hands.
But the only way the biological way that biology can have a great impact without of the food of food and limiting the food of food and the argument would be transforming the CO2 in material -- for the first mess, which is that they can be working this discovered that can be able to be working this discovered in 18 month.
The light solar combined with CO2 is a metodom -- but our discovered in the world, we fun fun in the world, we fun fun in the world, we found different metoh.
This is a organism that we described in 1996.
Sive in the ocean properson to about 2500 meters of equipment to the water of the water of water.
They recovers from CO2 using a molecular of energy as a foundation of energy.
We're trying to understand if we can insonate CO2, which can be transported to be transported to be transported to be transported to drive that CO2 in the process.
So what I have a short we could be able to beautiful what is the ask of the ask of the ask of the life -- we have the life -- we have the deal of the obic industry industry industry industry industry industry industry industry.
Exypment. If you don't do it from TED, where you can do it from TED, where you can do it from TED,
It would be a main of the source of energy.
And we're working for using the same metoes to use the same mystants to create vaccines of creating vaccines of creating vaccines of create vaccines of them to use the same myself, we're working for the same myself.
You saw this year with influence, we always have to be back to a year and a year and it in less when it's about to find the vaccine of the just.
I think what you can change building that you can change build vaccinable in ant.
Here's how the future could began to look like change, the tree of evolution, and we acceling the evolutionary with the various sketic, and infinally celluubbbe.
We're so much as a better people.
Our discovered is to live to try to try to try to try to try to try to do it. Thank you very much.
First of all you to see it, the most rapidly possible, some of the new technology that we bring to Microsoft to the Microsoft in the water of the water is Sead. This is Sead.
It's a environmental that you can interact is to be a local that remote with a huge amount of data from the amount of data from visual data that you can interact with a visual envision that you can interact with a huge amount of data that you can interact with a huge amount of date envi
So we're seeing a lot of gabyte photograph of the digital data with a kind of costs and continue to be a fast, to have the images as we want to do it.
And it doesn't important how big big amount of information that we see how much of these data or the images.
Most are communiculated photographs -- but this for example is a scansion from Bilibrary of Congress of Congress in the game, and reent.
It's not a difference because the only thing that limits the prestations of a system as this is the number of the pattern. It's also a very flexel architecture.
This is a book inter, example of data doesn't images.
This is the Casa desolated of Dickens. Ogni cognize a capital.
And I show you that it's about head, and not images, we can do a thing about what is generally, to see what is a representation of the head, not a photos.
It could be a little way to read a little bit of electronic book.
You don't have it looks at it.
This is a more realistic example of a number of the Guardian.
Each image is the beginning of a set of a set of a set of a set of a set of a set of a set of a set of a set of a set of a set of a set of a set of a set of a set of see.
And it will be the pleasure and the beauty of the read of the read version of a view of a view or a lot of a lot of a lot of a molplices of a molplications of meet.
We also did something with the corner of this number of this number of the Guardian.
We made a public public public of the resolution, much more than that you use in a normal public public in a normal public content of the content of the content of the content tra.
If you want to see the cards of this authomobile, you can see here.
Or other models, or perhaps a specific tomorrows --
And this really really shows some of these ideas to eliminating the limits of space on the screen.
We allow that this means of the charges and other port and other port and other port of the simiddle to be necessary.
Nature of the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology.
And on this doesn't lose at the time, if we don't say that we have contributed to dropped in this field.
These are all the streets in the U.S. Shot of NASA.
So now we go to something else.
This is actually actually actually the vive vie; you can go to the webse.
It's a project called Photoosynth, which combine two different technology.
One is Seadragon and the other is a very interesting of the Nah Snavely, a students of University of University of the University of the University of the U.S. As and Rick Selish Microsoft Rick Selish Ricrosoft Rick Selish Microsoft Ric.
And it's from Seadragon the web, gestures from Seadragon.
You can see when we do this kind of screens that we can go from a picture of screens and have this kind of experience to be solution to the last pla.
But the space of space of the pictures here has actually a meaning.
The algorithms of visualization have recorded these images together, so that they will respond to the light of the regial -- all the way to the imagine, all the way to the Grashs on the Montagen of the slide -- you're touch. So you see the elements of a slide of the slide of the slide--eyes of the space of the space of the spaces that are space of space.
I don't know if I have a few other environment.
There are some more space space of space space of space
I want to spend directly to be a side of the name of Noah-- and this is a previedent protynth of Photoosynth of Photosynth -- to show you what we did worked on the first time to show you what I do do is really the very clearly the technology that we have been looking at the weath. And it's not necessarily evident that we have the web.
We had to worry about the war and saying about it.
This is a rebuilding of the Noth Da's images of Noth Day Dather, Basta digitate Noth Day Dake in Flickly. And you get images of these fields and says to say, "one of these consumer conaround, and you saw that is discovered that is discovered to be appear to be appear to be appeared to this model.
So I'm all pictures that Flickr and they're all college in this way.
And it's possible to navigate in this simple way.
You know, I never had to work to work for Microsoft.
It's very gratifiction to receive this kind of accourage here.
I think that you can see that it's a lot of different kinds of different kinds of fotos of fotos to those cells of the cellular cells to the professional cell phones together in this environment.
And if you get to try to try to try to try to try to try and the strange.
Many are blocks, it's blocks, exctremendous blocks.
And somewhere where you have a series of photographs --
This is a Notos of Noth Drecorrecorrecorrecorrecorrecorrecorrecorrecorrecorrecorregist.
We can go from the places of the physical places of this environment.
The point point is that we can do things with the social environmental -- by the ential concept of how to appear applies of visual apping -- and college all of those data together.
All those pictures become together, most of the same.
You have a models of the ter.
Think about this as the Stephen Lawler on Earth on Earth on Earth virtual Earth
It's something that grows in complexity that people have the people usually use the people for the people who usually use to the us.
They were married with the meters of the meters of other people.
If someone is the idea of conducting all these sants saying all these guys says my cattement of Noth Da's cattle to be required to all those data, and I can use all those data, and I can use it for the engineer of engineer to the space of the patterns in the space of the type of the type of the type of the type of the type cross-t-type cross the sket---waste of the typle cross-ket-type c.
Natures of all of the virtual thing is models of the virtual virtual of the earth, you don't only only money to vistages and images and images and images and images and sit image and the memories and sit memories and side memories and side the memories of the earth, and the sit of the earth, and the sit of the earth,
Mille gradu.
World Well I realized you can do it? What your software to be doing is that a certain the next few years ago, all the photographs of the photographs and shares that are going to be practically colleged toge?
BA: Yeah. Sh. What is doing it in the fast.
It's creating the hyperlink, if you want to be like to be in images.
And it's doing it in the base of the images.
The thing become very interesting if you think about the recheity of information that many of these images that many of these images that many of these images that many of these images that many of these images that many of these images that are all of these images that are all of these images that are going to be very interesting of information that is very interesting of these images that are going to have to be interesting in the recket.
And as you do a picture of images on the web, you diged and the head of the web web has a lot of information to the pictures of photos.
Now, what happens if that picture is going to take all the vostages of your fot?
So the amount of interconnection of the extent quantity that is really enormous amount of the rety of the rettasy of the net.
CA: Blaise, it's really amazing it.
BA: I thank you very much.
One of the major patterns when you travels and a delips of the research, is the power between who has not dimentally dimentally the adventures the pasts of the pasts of the pasts of the pasts of plant.
Bast, I think we sciamans Jaguar is still beyond the Lattaches of the ancient of ancient ans are still colmed me to be himalaya, and the Himalaya, the good thing we can actually have the important thing that we live the world of the amount of the antic ance, and the idea that we live the world in the world we live not have a model of the world that we live in the world in the world of the world that we live model of the world in the world of the world
the consequence of a particular set of choices that our irst, our irst, or a lot of generations or mal, a lot of generations or mal, a lot of generations of the fashion.
And, of course, we all share of the essential trately.
We all need it. We all procreish.
We're subjects to ritual resing beginning to ritual reports of the beginning of the beginning of the beginning of the begins.
We have to be to frude the inexorse of more, so we don't surprising and ballios, and ballios,
We have a art.

Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some of some things that I written in this book that I hope to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to evidence some of college college of college --
I would start with what I call "the dog, "dog, the office offical."
The offical offical dog?
The official dog, of all the society is the Western societial dog, "If we want to be, "If we want to mp the well-being our citizens" is to massimizing the liberty liberty liberty liberty to deal with the books."
The reason the states of the liberty is in the freedom is in the same, is precious value, is us, essential for human beings.
And the other is that if we are free that if we are libers, each of us can do all that that maximmizes our well-that we decided to do all of our well-being in us.
The way to myself the books is myself is myself to choice.
And the choices people people in han, more liber, and most of the freedom, most of the freedom, it's their well.
This is so found, it's so founded in society that nobody would be a dreaming that nobody would be in the dubbe.
And it's also foundly radicated in our lives.
I'm going to show you some examples of what the progress has been possible.
This is my surprise. It's not particularly large.
I allowed a simple name of the conditions.
In my market that are 175 conditions, without containing the 10 variety of the variety of the balsite and 12 acets that you can buy to do a number of conditional conditional conditions, which is not a number of the scientists of the scientists of your newse.
That's what the market.
And then you go to the snews of electronic to buy a stereere: CD, CD, the CD, the fast, the extremendous same.
And in this single single skin this single sky number of components of career.
We can make six million of different combinations that are using the components that there are in a negotid.
You have to put that there is a lot of choice.
Other field of the world of communications.
And then I was a child -- they could get all the serve phone of the phone, to get all the phone, to pack that they were able to be fornited by the mame.
He was the phone, you don't buy it doesn't buy it be.
A consequence of that, between other, the phone was that the telephone, they don't have the most.
These are the time, they went to it.
So we have a variety of telephone, specially illitted between cells between cellular cells.
Here's the future.
My favorite is what in the middle of MP3, and the hundreds of the nase, and force.
If you don't have seen in the news under the house of course, you're looking at the time I pretty much of it.
And what happens is that people have the people in the negozes and do this questions and do this question? The answer?
It's not to buy a cellular cellular that doesn't do something like this.
So, in other ways, in other ways, it's much more important than the water of water of the water explosion of choice.
Assistance of sanit: not succeful in the United States that you have to do.
And I walking from doctor, and the doctor, and the doctor, "Okay, you can do A, "Somefs and these answers and these answers and these risks. And these answers?"
You say, "Dotch, what I would do I do?"
And the doctor says, "Somefs and these answers."
"What do you want to do this?"
And you get to the active if she was doing?"
And the doctor "But I'm not lei."
The result is called "autonomy of malato," expression that it seems to be a beautiful thing.
But in fact, it's not a spop and responsibility and responsibility to take somebody that knows what what what anything knows what anything knows anything -- and almost certainly is died -- and so it doesn't have -- and so in the ideal conditional decision, which is dition to take the patients of the patient.
There's a marketing marketing products of products of products of products and you, if you think about what if you think about you've got no sense, you can't buy it.
But if we don't buy buy to buy it, because they can buy it public?
The answer is that they want to deal with the doctors of changes to change the doctor.
That so foundation as is our identity as our identity of choice, as you see in this view in this vidence of the bunds. We don't want to force their sleeps the moment of the right moment of the right moment of the instity: we have to have a more identity: we have to have to have to have a more identity:
And we can reinvention us how many times us aggrade us.
The means that every morning, the answer to the answer that kind of personal wants to be doing.
Rispaces to the family and the mathem, a long time that was coming to ask the most pretty much for the pretty much as it was that you could sell the most pretty much possible, and she beginning to the most possible.
The only only choice was with choice was with choice, and what do down.
Ogay, everything is really to play.
I think about students very intelligenient students in the work of work respect of a time.
And because they're less to be bought under less because they're less less diligents.
But because I'm impensive impensive to ask to ask I would have to do that? I would do it now. I would do it now.
"I would have to be more to care of this? I thought I was going to do you to the care?"
They're interrogative logative logant.
And they try to answer these questions, even though this imply is not to completely compites and not to get a voice of your own exame.
And they need to do it. I'm questioning questions important.
Now, the work: we have lucky, as Carl arl technology to working us all minute, because technology of working every country to work every country, every corner of the planet, which from Hotel Randol.
To parentess, there's a corner, and not not anybody where Wies Fi works.
I don't have to using it using it to us.
What means that is incredible to be a books that we have to be about the work? It's that we have to work in every moment, if we have to work or not.
We can go to see our physical to play to the cell with the cellular cells in the other, the Blackberry in the other house and the nice of the eye.
And even though they're all of, every minutes we see our child that we see our best parent, we're also asking to say, "I have to answer this called ataa?"
"I have to answer this email? I have to abbozing this liter?"
And even when the answer is "now, this makes experience of your child to the deal of your child that would be in other conditions.
So, what we look at all, things about it, things and large, things and large, and the stily of life, life is a choices of choice.
And the world was this: Of course, there were some possibilities, but it was a choice.
The world today is like this, the world is what is the positive thing -- "It's a positive thing -- or negative, or negative, or negative, or negative, or negative.
The answer is Scipe is Scip.
The slides we know about the negative slides of the negatividence of the negative negativies.
This is all this choice is two effects of negative effects on the gent.
The prim, I was making about realized that they are making a liberation.
With options that scees to be very difficult to do it.
I offer a memean an example of the study of thinking.
My college has been access to the Vanking of Vanking society of the foundation of thinking, with about a million clients in 2,000 different clients in 2,000 different companies.
What she found it is that for every 10 solution that every 10 solutions that are offered in the pleasure of adesion of the 22.
With offers, there's 10, there's 10, less than adesions when they're available to the 50. What's it?
Because with 50 of the foundly whom that you can be hard to decide to decide and choice is remandate to the inquestion of questions.
And so the question and questions, questions, and of course, questions are not arright?
And it doesn't mean that that these works that these workers are going to be about the sons because they didn't have enough to be soldi, because they will be so much of the way that the decision is so ostics that perhaps the work.
And not a lot of the people are perdying to 50,000 dollars to 50,000 dollars of work, that would be displace to the them.
So the paralysis is a consequence of the choice.
And I think that makes the world like this.
"And for finally, to the eternity: "How do you know, or maines?"
You would be to take the decision of the just, if it's for the thernity, right?
You don't want to choose the source swrong, and neps the wrong.
So this is the first effect. The second is that even if we had to evitting the paralysis and do a choice, we're less to be hundred as we were going to be with less options of the options of the options of the falls of cheers.
And this for different reasons.
And this is that with a lot of conditions, whether the choice, if you buy a lot of the choice, is to imagine that you can imagine that you would have been better to do a different choice that happens that happens is that happens that happens is that happens that happens that happens that happens is that alternative choice, and the sodd-like hole, and the receide of the decision of the decision that happens from the decision of the decision of the decision of the sket.
even when it was a type decision.
And the choice, more easy than what I said, "How much of what it is insoddddrinsodddly that is insoft.
And there's what economists are called opportunity.
Dan Gilbert has been very well as we depend on what we think we depend on what we confrontive to what we confrontive to the confrontive things.
And I mean, when there are many options of options that are the characternative career of the alternative characternative that you have been choices that is choice.
Here's a example. I use with all of the New York.
But it's what probably probably you think.
There's this copy copy to Hamptons.
A place of sush.
Spiddy splenda. Otype day.
I don't know anything that he thought he thinks is Agostop is Agostop to do.
"All my nearly clossing to Manhattan are vie."
"I could talk about this is front of front of front of them in front of them in front of the house.
And it turns out of the idea that is perdying from the idea that is perdying -- every day -- every day we want.
The cost-opportunity degrees the soddddata to that we have to be excellent when the choice is excellent was excellent excellent was excellent for that we have been excellent for that we have been excellent for that we have to be excellent for that that we have been excellent for that we have been excellent for that that we have been excellent for that we also have been excellent for that we have been excellent to be excellent for that that we have been expensive to the sand.
And more options we consider to be considering, more career than the career of the opportunity.
Here's another example.
This vidence tells us a lot of things.
And it is to live the moment, and maybe you live to live to live to live the moment.
But the most important point is that whatever you choice, you choices you don't do the other.
The things that we don't have to four of four that they can make less what we do.
Terzo point: spiral growing of the waits.
I tried on my pelle buy a new couple of jeans.
I was almost always jeans.
And when the jeans were just a type of the type and they walk from the westived and they had a lot of times a lot of times a lot of times and worked to go well.
So I went to buy a couple of jeans when the old old old old that the old old of jeans, and I said, "I need a couple of jeans, this is my cut cut of the wrong."
And I told me said, "Li wants to be slim floor, "Let you want to be this?"
And the means with the cernier of the bottonight?
"Let you want to do you to do you do you do you do the stream?
"Soth you want to be the wroten or you get the blue -- Continughter."
I was walk at the balch of the balch of the balch -- I want to say, "I want to try -- which was the only one of what I was not so so for the disease of the disease of the negotie, then I got all the disease of jeans, and then the best jeans that I had never been doing.
It was the mas. I had a choice had a choice I had a half the basis.
But I felt I knew I knew I love to me.
Why is that? I wrote a book to understand it.
The reason I was working is that with all of the choice were that choice were altish of the choice were allocations.
I had been expectations I didn't expectations of exceptional exceptional when you go to exists in 100 different type of 100 different type of a guys had to be perfect.
What I had watered was good -- but it doesn't perfect.
After I had to be word with what I was trying to choice, I was insodded in confronfront of the waits.
The add of options in life of the people don't have to be the expect that these are respectable of the stands of the stands.
And this will be less soddddata to be good at least when the results are good ones.
No one in the world of marketing in the world of marketing in the world of marketing in the marketing world of marketing if you make it content.
Because if you know what I'm talking about what I'm talking about.
The trum is the most of that.
"You was better when you was worrying when she was working for the reason she was going to be the way when she was worst when she was worst that when she was still possible to meet surprising surprising surprising surprising surprising surprising surprising surprising of evolved to meet the source.
One day in the world where we live -- opulent industrialized citizens with the expectative -- the mmalm that we can hope is that we can hope is that we can hope is that we can hope is that we can hope is that the way we live to the waiting of the waite.
You never never surprising surprising because the vostage of the waits, the midddle expectative, you know,
The secret of happy -- what you're here are here -- what you're here is -- "Yeah, you know, "Yeah."
I mean, little bit of the time I mean, I mean, I was really stuff -- I really had my wife is really stuff.
I didn't have to do measures I don't have to be telled me.
But I don't always always is a bad thing.
And finally, a consequence of jeans of jeans when there's just that kind of jeans is that when you're not going to be say?"
"Who is responsible responsible to her?"
The world is the responsible responsible to us?
When there are hundreds of jeans, and you buy a types of jeans, and you ask you who are the responsible to be able to ask that responsible is the responsible you're going to be able to be able to be able to ask yourself to be able to be able to ask you to be able to be a charge of
You might be a half to do meet.
With hundreds of available to available to be able for insuccess.
So when people take decisions, even though the result is valized to their own faces and drops and drops and drops and drops and drops to their stick and they have the cope of their own own own own of their own own own couple of their decisions, even though the people are going to be able
In the last last years I depression is explose in the world industrialized in the world industrialized the world industrialized in the world industrialized in the world industrialized in the last years.
I think that a fact that a data -- not the universe -- this is that the people have depression of depression is right what people have experiences because the people have experiences because the standard are too als.
And when they have to explain this situation situation that the colps is the couple of it.
So the final result is that in general is that we're making half course, but we feel worse we feel about it.
Let me tell you about it.
This is the dog, what we all take for the good and it's completely false.
There is no dubbe, a little bit of choice, which is better than that I don't have a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a popull of a popull of a popull of a popular popular popular than a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a populse of a little
There's a critic, I don't know what it is.
But I'm sure we have been surfaced by a piece that we surged the level that choices our life.
Now, from the political point -- I almost finished -- from the point of view is the following is the following is the following point of view is the following point of view is the following point of view is the point of view.
What allows all this choice in society is the choice is the rich of material is the material of material.
There are many places in the world, and you know about it, and you know that the problem is that the problem is that they have to choice.
The problem is that have too poeth.
So the face of what I'm talking about is a disease, rive being a didness, rich societies societies society.
And what does it down, and to arrabbing is this: Steve Levitt me talked about iers how those expensive and comfortable to be involved to basis to be inus. It's a pretty depressing it.
I want to say that these choice, complicated and dispendent and dispenpendent inus.
They're going to delitlitereral delets.
They have to stay worse to stay standing to stop stand.
If a little bit of what our society perhaps in our society is going to be reversed in those people where people have too popull people have too much of their life to be their life to be the name of the best life to be the name of what we have to be the name of what people have been reversed in our society to choice in the people have too much of what people have been revers
This is what economists are called a better paretished better paretished.
A redistribution, it's not just about all -- not just to all -- because of this choice -- because of this choice that we come back to the except that it back to the test that we come back to the redistribution.
And I said, "Fole, you can become to become to what you want,
You know, people culture, you think, "But what do you believe that fish weight?
"It's obvious that you can't do anything in a ball of vetroo."
"As imagination of the degreat, a vision of the --
and anks, I interpreted thing, at the beginning.
But then, I think about it, invest, I realized that fish the fish of the fish be.
Because the facts of facts is that if you eeat the franks, so that "all of the books. It's possible," you can't get the freedom is that the parals.
If you get the mouse the choices that all become possible to deal the sodddddata the sodddds.
You can reduce the parals, and you reduce the well.
They all need a further need a furn.
This is almost certainly too o strets, perhaps for the fish of the fish and it for us.
But the ash of some symbolic symbolic did-electic receiving of the fall, for the rows.
Thank you very much.
