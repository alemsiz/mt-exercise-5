The last year I showed these slide to show that the totice glacial calculus for almost three million years had been the dimensions of 48 States has been restretttype of 40 percent.
All this underestimate the gravity of the problem because it doesn't show the suspendent of the ice of the ice ice ice of the ice ice ice souldn't show it as well.
The art glacial climate is in some sense, the heart heart, the heart heart of the global climate system.
You expand you get rid and you get right.
The next next slide will be a rapid carlled on the last 25 years.
The glyack is reached in red red it.
As you see, you expand the blue screen.
That's the ice ice ice in the winver, which is a returning of summer.
You can see that the glacior perenn, or five years or more, it's like the blood -- that's like the blood that there was a blood from the body.
In 25 years is spent on this --
This is a problem because the interested in the land the ice ice ice ice ice the lands around the ocean art where there are enormous amounts of carbon -- they get transformed in meter metanches from microbies.
Remempt to the totality of atmospheric heading from global warming pollution could raddop, super-well-return pollue.

Video: Wow! Al Gore: She is good. The question is if we will be the well.
A reason is that this exchange that this exchange in the Greenland the Greenland from the north.
This is a glacial to regime
The taken had never reached a similar levels.
This is the Kangerlussuaar and the Greenland the Greenland the Greenland and the Greenland and the Greenland on the Greenland on the Greenland on the west Kangerlusa-obs.
If you want to know how the sal level of the sky's level of the garbel, here is where the sea skin the sea land.
These are rents are increasing rapidly.
On the other side of the planet: An biggest block of the planet.
The months last months have dichiated that the balance of the ice ice is in negative, and that the West and the West and the West artide Western in some island under the brow of the gate;
Equid to six feet of water in Greenland as in Greenland as a well.
On Himalaya, the third largest block of ice block of ice block -- who were leaders in the glacia.
40 percent of the world's population received by what I mean.
On Ande: this glaciers is the source of the water of this city.
The brand is increased.
But when you dimine, it happens to the same across the water.
In California the neve snow in the Nevada is diminuth.
The rights are in crisis.
The predictions, as you have a grave.
The growing growth in the world takes a remarkable increasings.
The environmental disasters are increasing to a normal out of the normal and no precedent.
Four times more numbers in the last 30 years old.
This is a whole thing of insustainable to remainly remarkable go.
If you look at the context of the story if you can see the consequence.
In the last five years we added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the oceans every day.
Look at the point of the Pacific area from American East of the continent of the continent of the continent of the continent of the continent of the continent of the obsible ox, where there's a radical impose in the oceans.
The global warming of global warming deforestation, and with the deforestation, which is the use of the fuel.
The oil is a problem, and the carbon is a problem, and the carbon is even worse worst
The United States are one of two countries with more emission, together to China.
And they were going to build many other central central central and carbon and paper carbon and and they were making a lot of other carbon to build a lot of other carbon and and they provide a lot of other central central central central and lots of other central central central central
But we're assisting to a change of direction.
These are the annual projects in the last few years and some of the rest of alternative vers.
At every way, there's a political lotate in our country.
The carbon and and the oil industries have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote the carbon and and the carbon and and the carbon and and oil
This image reminized me something,
Nat't, Natmain Tennesse, where I was a 3.8 billion literal scores of carbon garbon of carbon garbon.
Maybe you saw it on the news of the news.
This is the second greatest floating of scores in America.
It's happened around Natmains around Natma.
The natalized natalian industries of carbon industry.
Video: Man: Sh. She's a carbon is a kind of happy and happy.
It's abundant here in America, and it makes our economy.
Frosty the carbon is more and more more clean more and more clean more clean hold.
It's about a good price, loyet and workers keep the stypendent stic.
Al Gore: Dto here is a lot of the carbon of the West Virginia.
The largest society on the mountains is Massey Coal. This is his friendly the amministrator.
Video: Don Blank: I'm going to be clear -- Al Gore, Nancy Pelogic -- they don't know what they're talking about.
Al Gore: So the Proteon the Proteon the Clima has two ness.
This is one of it, a part.
Video: All right. ALLet's see we see the climate change as a threatens as a threaten.
So our priority is invest a great amount of money in a very power of money in a public properly and confuses the truth, and confuses the truth.
In fact, the carbon is not spore.
We think it's pulled -- it's a good -- it has a good profum.
So not predictable.
Let me do to do now.
Video: All right.
So let's take a gyp into a structure at the frameworking for the carbon for a clean to the carbon the clean to get a frame.
Straordinary machines are a little nois! The machines are the sound of the technology of the technology of carbon technology --
The consumption is between the main causes of global warming causes of global warming and the technology of carbon that you see change.
Do an ey: this is the technology of carbon carbon carbon carbon the carbon the technology of carbon the carbon and and clean eye.
At Gore: Inally, the positive alternative positive is connected to the economic issue and the national security.
Video: Some is in crisi; the economy, the national security climate national crisis.
The filter that college all of the face that our dependence by the combined fuel, as the carbon and the important.
Now, there's a new auding, there's a new audience, by circumstomer to us.
Repower America. 100-house energy in dies.
A plan to stop the work, to make sure, to make sure and help stop, and help the global warming.
Finally, a solution that basts to solve our problems.
By America. Scoprints more.
Al Gore: This is the ultimate one.
Video: Here is is to reduce America.
One of the fastest ways to take the dependence by the dependence by the combined dependence that our planet.
All the future is here. I think, is here. I think, a new network.
She talks about 2: Nuoves to work of well-retribes of work beyond retribes.
All right. It's time to be realists.
Al Gore: A old African old proverbio African old says, "If you want to go to the so.
If you want to go away and you get away together."
We have to go away, quickly --
Thank you very much.
The year last year at TED fect on the LHC.
And I try to go back to the machine.
So I got out here. And for those who are not the other time -- the LHC is the largest scientific experimented -- 27 miles of circumstomer circumstomer of circumstomer circumstomer of circumstomer surround circumst
Her compiece is to realize the conditions that were less than a second by the beginning of the universe -- until beginning of the universe -- until 600 million times a second.
All that's simply environment.
This is the machine underneath the Gineva.
We can make these mini-Bang Big Bang Bang in the relievers.
This is what I work. It's called ATLAS -- is a 44 feet and has a diameter of 22 feet and has a diamet.
This is an image spectacular image of ATLAS in building so you can see the proportions.
10 we'll get the last year we have accesses the machine for the first time.
And this picture was taken by ATLAS.
It was a lot of immenses in the healthy room in the heavy room
It's a first picture of the first particles that had all the gone around the LHC, entering in collision, by by LHC, and a particles in the LHC, and spread particles inside the relievator.
In other words, when we see that image the 10 10 settember 10 settember the machine works, which is a big liftye.
I don't know if it was to do it more opping this when somebody went on to Google and saw that the page was this --
That means that we had a cultural impact on the scientific impact on that scientific impact.
About a week later, there was a problem with the machine, had to these files here -- these files -- these files.
These files bring 13,000 ample better, when the machine workers in the power.
Now, technicians between you look at files and say, "It's not true. They're true. They're films."
And they can do it because when they are very cold, they become the coside,
So, at least 271 degrees, at least to the space between the stars, these movies can bring that corner.
In one of the most of the most innovnovement of the most of LHC, there was a fabrication.
So the files are surrisis to read themselves to get away and 13,000 ample printed meet a resistance of electricic.
This was the result.
Now, this is even more impression, if you think these magnets are more than 20 tons than 20 tons -- and that have been moved with about 30 centimeters.
They're damamong about 50 magnets.
We had to take it and what we did it.
We have repristed them and add and add them.
They're now now now now now in their ground.
Entruth, the LHC is will be new integrated integry.
We're going to access it to get the data to get data to jug, and and continuing so our wind or him, and continuing so our adventure to discover what the universe.
Now, of course, in a certain some ways, these accidents relief accidents on the value of science and engineering in frontiers. It's easy to confuture it.
I think the fact that it's so difficult, the fact to go beyond the limits, I think it's the value of things like LHC.
I want to conclude with the words of a Ingles, Humphrey Davy, which is imagine, in defense of inuseful experiments of its puzzle and his clean inuse of the inuse of human mind is so dangerous to the progress of human mind as much of human mind as the science is definitive as wells us that are not in nature -- and in nature, that there are no money, and in nature money, and in nature,
Thank you.
I want to start asking you to rethink about here, by a children, by a children, they play cool matter with the morning cooks.
While you understand how you realize them and and resolve them and move them and move them and move them and move them and resolve and solving relationships.
The space is deeply is deeply to think of the world around us.
So, as a informath inspired by using the usal objects of physics, together to my consults, and my collaboratory collaboratory and my collaboratory and I started to ask myself, as we use a computer, instead of having the hands as well-hand-d-digital that moves on a now keye with a handle information with both ent, to deal with both and information with both and information with both hands,
and to look at our pleas?
The question was so interesting that we decided we decided to explore the answer to the answer the answer to the answer to the answer to explore the answer.
In poor, a Siftable is a whole whole computer interactive as a big discovered computer.
In poor, a Siftable is a whole whole computer interactive as a big discovered computer.
You can move them with hand, they can see it "You're going to see right now, and they have a wireless.
But absolutely -- I am physics, as the matter matter and they can simply realized to gold.
The Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem for manipulate information.
And as they get more physics, and consciousness of the right and as they are more physics, and as they get more physics, and as we can exploring new physics, how we can move exploring new and funny of interaction.
I'm going to start with some simple example.
This Siftable is configured to show the video -- if you inct it including the video it will be so if you inct it including it back to the other side back.
These interactive ritual rites are conscious about others.
If you are doing it, you interested in what they are going to be around it.
If they are surround and they can agge, and they can agre a little bit of a little bit of it.
If they are surround and they can agge, and they can agre a little bit of a little bit of it.
They also have their movement and inclined and inclination.
We then realized that one of the interaction was the power to use gestures on the data, to example with the interaction of the interaction as if it's a liquid books.
In this case, we have three Siftable configurated as a seck of green and I can use them to be able to be the central colors in the central central where they mission.
and I can use them to be able to use them to the central central where they misse.
If we can read a little bit about place.
They're also beautiful to learn about how the language, as the language, and mathematics and logical gical games where people can try and see the immediately.
I'm --
This is a Fibonacus that I do with a program of equations.
Here we have a game of words that is in Scarabeo and Boggle.
Pratically, to every turn Siftable, you get a letter on every Siftable, Pratically, to every turn Siftable, and as you can get a letter to be a dition.
Then, after about 30 seconds remissing and you have a new set of lects, and new possible to try to try to try to prove and new possible to try to try to try to try to try to be try.
Thank you.
Here's what children came to the Middle Lab, I did it in a way that they tried them and I gave them a video.
They were pleased to them very much.
And one of the interesting things that kind of application is that you don't have to give people a lot of education.
You just saying, "However, and they know exactly what to do.
That's what people are trying to do it.
This is our most younger beta younger than the right.
It really wanted to be very larger and it was just implemented.
They just were just mains in him.
Now, this is an application of a interactive application of a interactive application of a interactive application of a interactive application.
We wanted to build a tool for the apprecient of the Lui is Felix.
It can inserve new characters in the scene, and they were the Siftable to their associats.
It can inserve new characters in the scene, and they were the Siftable to their associats.
So it's doing the sun.
Video: The only is smild.
David Merrill: She brought a treat in the scen.
Video: The arancient treat.
Bel work!
So I get the Siftable to get the Siftable to make the characters --
Video: Bau!
-- by by using their story.
Video: Ciao!
DM: It's a story with an open, and it can decide how you get away.
DM: It's a story with an open, and it can decide how you get away.
Vole, garts.
DM: The last example I have time to show you is a tool, realized by recently, to sample, to sample, and exexeguess and exciting music.
it's a tool, recently recently, to sample and exect to sample, and exeguess music.
The Siftable here are slowed by sound like base, and the bacteria.
Each of these has four different variation, and you can choose what to use it.
You can get these sound on these sound in a sequence to your feet to your feeling or your feeling on your set.
And to modify it by making a sound and a "sound like "sound like "sound."
These are effects that you can control, as the reverse and the filter.
The attack to a particular soulder and then including it to add it.
And then there are general effects as time and volumes, that are apply to the entire sequence.
Let's look at how it works.
Video: DM: We're going to start a base in two Sift," we will start a sequence, we system, the way we walk into a series, we add the other basic be.
Now I put a bassroom.
Video: DM: Are you add to be a --
Video: DM: And I'm going to put the filtery filtery on the bacteria, so I can control effect from live.
Video: DM: I can know how to quickly the whole sequence inclining time from one side or the other.
Video: DM: And I'm going to add the movie to give more expression.
Video: DM: I can recombine the sequence to the sequence "volo
So I didn't have to plan the first one, but I can sudden, but I can try and make it longer or more corta.
And now, finally, I can get the whole sequence in the left slowing the entire sequence the Siftable "volume."
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is building new interface of men machine more more and more more more than our brain workers and corp.
And today, I had time to show you one of the results of this percorn and some possible possibility that we try to bring out of the laboratory.
The concept I want to transmit you is that it's coming this new generation of objects to interact with digital media to interact with digital media that we want.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the now to talk with all of you.
They're a writing writing.
Sorce books is my profession, but it's more than that, obviously.
It's also the love and the fashcle of my life.
And I don't expect that can change it.
But I said, something particularly successful happened in my life and my career, and my career and my career, that has taken me to realibrate the entire report.
The particularly thing is that I recently written this book, this biography called "Mangia, Ama." And the different previous libris, for some reason for a big sensational reason for the world and became a big sense of interaction.
And the result is that everywhere you go to now, people are treating me as if they were convicted to me.
It's true -- convicted -- convicted --
They come to me and they all worried and say, "You can't fear anymore, "You can't fear more than to do that?
You don't fear of continuing to write for all of life without able to create a book, that can be able to create a book, that can be able to somebody who who can you have to be able to make somebody un?"
that can be to important somebody who is this?"
It's a resurely enables, you know.
But it may go worse -- I remember that more than 20 years ago, when I started to say people -- I was a teenager -- I was a teenager -- I wanted to be a write write of a write writing.
I met against the same based by the feeling reaction.
And people say, "Don't do you can not be able to have success?
You wouldn't you fear the upon reject you kill you do?
You wouldn't you feel this well to do this mester and you can die and die to come and dig out and dig frankly on a heart of switching with the mouth of flight?"
So you know, you know.
The answer -- the short answer to all of these questions is, "S."
I fear of all these things.
I always had been fear --
And I also have a lot of other things that people might not have to be to ine.
As a and other things -- and other things --
But as I think about what I was thinking and I was thinking and I ask to be a really because it is?
Is it it ration?
It's logic that anybody who who needs to be speaking to be speaking to be slowed to do.
But what is that particular in the impresely creative to make us nervous about mind-minute less-making reefs not do?
How my father, for example, he was a engineer and I don't remember one time in his 40 years of its activity where the asked if he was asked if he had been asking if he had to be engineer capit?
There was never -- that there was that John, like you wouldn't it?
It didn't work.
Onestly, the engineers as group as group don't have certainly in the century, the reputation of being allowed to be highly maniacross the reputting reputting reputting reput.
We have enough, we have enough this reputation, and not only writers but creative writers but creative reputation of all that we have this reputation of instable.
And it's not going to look at the tristage of the magnific deaths of magnificent creative dies that only in the century, they have young people and often to them.
And even those who are not suicide are really seems to be really displaced by their woms.
Norman Mailer, before I did, in the last view said, "Ogni boook, I killed a little bit more than it of your life.
But we don't brow the way we feel that we feel these things that are so much long-that we were completely interior interior and the neglaped and the sofering and the sofer is in some way and the art of the art and the art and the art will always get to the angood, and then it will always get to the angoods?
And the question I want to ask everyone is that I want to ask with this ide?
It comes you to do this -- because you look at it from a centimeter at me -- it doesn't good for anything that supposed to do anything that supposed to do this suppose.
I think it's hodiose.
And I think it's dangerous and I don't want to see it in the next century.
I think it's better to encourage our big minds creative to live.
And I know that in my case -- in my case -- in my case -- it would be very dangerous to that feeling towards that I feel the circumstances that are in my career.
Obly -- involved look at it, I'm pretty young young --
I still have about four decade of work in me.
And it's very likely that anything to write more than now, in then will be right by the world as the work that was going to be right after I often this happened by my last book.
I'm going to be slavery, because we're all more or less friends here -- it's probably the most success is to my greatest success is to my shoul.
Oh, Gesus, who think!
You know this is the kind of thinking that it brings a person to start to start to get the nine morning and I don't want to do it.
I would keep to do this work that we do.
So, the question become, come?
And so it seeds to be able to work for keep to work to keep keep to keep up to keep a psychological costructural cool, ok?
I have to find a distance of security between me, I am writing to me, and I am writing to what react reaction is going to get the way to get the next year for the last year I start looking through the time, trying to look through the time, trying to find other societies to see if they could have more more societies to see if they were better ideas and seeing other societies and healthcare and and healthy and healthier and healthy as and security to see if they could have a more and healthize the more and healthy as and
how to help people creative to help the inerent inerent inerent people emotion.
And that research has taken to the Grecia and Roma.
Seguith the game and then back.
In the ancient Grecia and Rome -- people don't seem to believe that creativity came from men from men en from men and OK?
It was thinking that creativity was this spirit about diving and selling that was from a few surface and unknown, for distant distant distant and unknown.
The gree called these divines called the creative "demoney."
Socrat, wonderful of having a demon that skying,
The Romans were the same idea, but they call that kind of spirit without a genius.
The one is great because the Romans didn't think that a kind of a genius was somebody particularly smart.
They believed that a genius was this kind of divine that was going to live in the walls of a study of a artist, a little bit like the Dobby, and that was out out of the work of the argument and modeling the work of the artist of the artist of the result and modeling the result of that work.
Exectional -- et, that's the distance of which I talk -- that psychological costruction that you protect you from the work.
And everyone knew that was so that he worked, right?
So the antiantic artists were protected by certain things, like for example, or example, right?
If your work was exceptional work was exceptional you couldn't have the market, everybody who were helped by this incorporate genius.
If your work is a whole bunch -- it wasn't all of your own own your own work, right?
They knew that was your genius to be a inabilities.
And so people conceived the creative in Occident for a long time.
Then the Rinachieved and everything is, and you know, and all this big idea; we put the human being; we put the human beings and no longer and no longer and no longer and no longer leave the creatures that write from divinity.
This was the principle of human eximent and people start to think about creative and people start thinking that creative creativity from the ishing.
And for the first time in history, you start to referred this or that artist as a rather than a genius with genius.
And I have to tell you that was a big error to be a big error here's a big error her.
I think allowing somebody to create somebody to believe like a recipient as a source of being as the source of all my own mysteries and source of all my divince and ethern is a film or too big to give it to the fragile fragile to the phragile fting human fragile ft.
It's like to ask somebody to enjoy the sun.
Deform and destores the ego and creates all these expectations on performance.
And I think it's this pressure to destruct the artists in the past.
And if this is true, and I think the question become, and now?
Can we do it different?
Maybe you go back to a more more ancient understanding of the relationship between human and creative mystery and creative mystery.
Or maybe no.
Maybe we can't cancells in a rational thinking about a talk about 18 minutes.
And there are probably people in the audience that would be reading with the scientific notion that they were charging the notion of scientific notion of the things that are following successful floors of them projects.
I probably don't have to convince you all about this thing.
But the question I would like to take is -- why do you know?
Why don't think it in this way?
Because it has more sense of every other thing that has ever heard to explain the exasperant impresedition process of creative process.
A process that we have ever tented to do something -- so that you have ever been doing something -- yet, you don't get rectionally.
And in fact, it can seems completely paranormal seems completely paranormal paranormal looks like a completely paranormal times like a completely paranormal times like this.
I did this met recently with the extraordinary Ruth Stone, who has now 90 years old, but that was a poet, and he said that during his life and he said, that during his own infection in the Virginia, working out in the well of the Virginia, and I feel it from the countrack in the countrack of the countrack of the countrysical exployment to the country's wind the wind of the extraordinary recently in the slightly the extraordin
He said that he was like a big bragorous track --
And that was going to get rolling to her landscape from the landscape.
He heard it comes to the ground land under the land under its feet.
He knew to have one thing to do to that point and he was saying, "corrupt like a morning like a morn."
And so he was going to get into the house and it wouldn't have to do another poet, and it wouldn't have to make another piece of paper and a faster enough in the past, as the translate and and deal and saving it on the page.
Other volves you enough to be enough fastonished and corres and corres and wouldn't get to the rolled rolled through and she was going through and she would have been going through the lands and she would have been going to roll through the landscape and he said, "Another a poeta."
Then there were those times -- this piece is not forget -- there were moments in which the nearly squared the nearly stay?
So, he was running at home and he was looking for the card and the poetry was going through and walking through a matheme right as he was going to go and then said, he was like if you get away with the other hand and and the off.
He was the poetry from the codle and the reputs in the body and the page and the page.
And in these cases, the poetry would be on the perfect and pack page and the last word on the first maintains from the earlier word to the earlier.
So when I feel that I feel -- it's exactly equal to my creative process.
Not all my creative process -- I'm not a convict!
I'm a mule, and my way to work is to work with the same orary every day and work and work and work and work and work and work and work and work and work on and work and go and work on and work on the godly.
But even though I was in my head again, I realized against that thing,
And I imagine that many of you have a lot of you have the face.
You know, even if the work and ideas and ideas and I came to give you a certain source I could be saying.
And what is this thing?
And how can we relate to that it doesn't make us to lose the head, but it makes us remains to make us sani?
And as I really, the best example of contemporary I have is Tom Waits, which I interviewed in the day.
We were talking about that, and you know, Tom, for the major the major of life was the incarnation of the artist of the artist of contemporary artist of creative impulses these creative impulses.
But then he hot it, and a day he was driving on a day carried on a highway to Los Angeles, it turned everything for him.
He was going to go quickly and a sent tract of meloda, that comes into his head as the inspiration, which is the inspiration, and the wish and and the wish and you want to get there, but you don't know how to take it.
It has no paper piece of cards, not have a mathemb, it has no mathemb.
So it begins to feel this kind of old old old old old old that you can grow up in the type, and I will broke up with this song perform by this song perform for perform
I don't have enough enough and I can't do it."
And instead of go into the panic stoppanic --
And I'm going to do the whole mental process and he did something new happen.
Look at the sky and said, "Scuse, you know, I'm not going to see that I'm driving that I'm driving it?"
"You seems that can write a song now?
If you really want to exist, you get back to a more opportunity when I can take care of you.
One of course, you get to important.
You go to the Leonard Cohen."
And his working changed after this.
Not the work, the work was still as you set as you seed.
But the process, and the fishing thing was released when the genius was released when the genius was going to have nothing else and the genius would be realizing out of where he was coming back to where he was coming out of where it was a interiorning.
But you know, this piece of piece of piece of bizarre collaboration a conversation between Tom and this strange and external thing that allowed wasn't Tom.
So I felt that story that was to change a little bit also the way I worked and saved me a little bit of a time.
This idea, saved when I was writing "Mangia, and I writing in one of those hundred dispertion in one of those dispertion in which we are working on something and we can't get think, and you start thinking that will be a disaster that that that it's going to be the worst of worst writing book.
Not just -- not just the worst book, writing the worst writing.
And I started to think about designing this project.
But then I remember Tom who talked about the air and triaway.
So I got my face on the handle of the handling and and I would say my comments to a corner of the room.
And I said, "You know, you know, "You know, you know, you know, both that if this book doesn't be brilliant that if this book, it's not going to be brilliant not be brilliant not be brilliant not just be brilliant not going to be brilliant not be brilliant to be brilliant not going to be brilliant not be brilliant to be brilliant not be brilliant not going to be brilliant not be brilliant to be brilliant not going to be brilliant to be,
Because as I see as I am I'm going to put all of what I have, not more than that.
So if you want it to be better and you have to get your parts.
OK. But if you do not do it, you know, I don't know what I do is a couple of nothing.
I'm going to write the same because it's my work.
And I would like to flew that I today today I today today I presented to my part, because -- the end is that, OK, and it is that, OK, and it is -- and it makes them up for the dances of the dances and the mosacross the dances and the sacross the sacross the sacross the basic and the hours to the high basic and the hours to the higher and the hours and at the hour--up,
And they were always magnized, because the ballers were professional and they were fantastic and they were fantastics.
But every one of it, something happened -- and one of these artists became to actually translate translate in fact,
And I know what I know about what I know about it, because I know that you all all of you can see all of a point, a lock like this.
It was as if you stopped and the walking walking through a kind of lands and walking through a kind of lapse and was not doing nothing that was doing nothing before, but everything you were allowed to hit it it up.
And suddenly not as a human beings as a human human one.
But you get out of the didental and under the divinity of divinity.
And when this happen, the theme, the people were knew what it was, they were going to call it the names with us.
They had the hands and and they were going to sing, "Ah, Do, "Oh, Do, God, God, God,
That's God, you know.
Curiosa story -- when the Mororst the south of Spana, they preserve this abitude with their and pronunced in the centuries from "Ah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, whether you can feel in the corrids or in the corride or in the corries or in the corries or in the corrids or in the corries of the Spay of the Spay --
In Spana, when a artist made something impossible and magic -- and oh, ol, "Ah, magnific magnificent -- and I mean, you know, a scor, and a score, and a scor.
And it's great because we need.
But the problem comes the day for the ballery ballery ballering the ballery day and discovering that are the 11 of Maredday and the last last night.
It's just a death, with the kned, and maybe it will never be able to ascend to that allow to that allow that alteach.
And maybe no one dogs the name of God even as you go, and so he has to do with the rest of his life?
It's hard to hard it.
This is one of the most dolorous reciliest to make in a creative life.
But maybe it doesn't have to be so angood-setting so much of you can not believe it, as you can be as extraordinary as you get from you to be from you set to you go.
But believed that you have given you data from a squist with a squisite of this squisite of your life that you have to go to somebody else when you find.
And you know, if we think in this whole whole whole whole change.
And so I started thinking about it, and it's sure, as I thought of a book, as I thought for different months in the job, which I'm going to be the public book, often speak of my big success.
And what I have to keep in saying, when I feel electric feelectric to be putting with the well.
Don't go to the work. It's just your work.
He knows to presenting you to get you to get you to be.
If your work is ball, ball, ball.
If the game is you can get a kind of a very beautiful devices of leave some kind of wonderful as a moment through your sources, then "Ole!"
One of course, you do the same tumor dance.
And "Ole!" to you stop the same.
I think I think it's to teach it.
"Ole!" to you stand you stand and in the same, and head and head and head and test to be continuously.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
As you know I talked about some of these projects on human genome on what can meaning and what can meaning and discovered with genes.
Now we're starting a new lost of -- we started to digitalize biology and now to go from that code and now to go from that code in a new squarter, designing and synthetic and synthetic and synthetic lifes.
We always seeing a big questions.
"What is the life, you have a lot of biology biology I believe that they have come to various levels.
We tried to have a different approach, reduced the minimes of minimes.
We're digitalizing by almost 20 years old.
When we sequenced the human genome was to go from the analogic world of biology in the world of biology in the computer.
Now we ask us, we can regenerate life, or create new life from this digital?
This is the map of a small organism, the Mycoplasma genitalium, which is the smallest genome between those who can authoreplicating in the laboratory.
And we tried to reduce the genome to create a little bit more than a little bit more than that.
We're able to eliminate a hundred genes of the about 500 that are here.
But when we look at a metabolic map of metabolic map on the now.
She says, that's simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can elimine, a very improbably that this can bring to a live.
So we decided that the only way to progress was synthetic to progress this chromosomes in a way to get the component components to bring some of these fundamental questions.
And so we started the wall, "We can we synthesize a cromother?"
It can make a chemistry to produce these big molecules that we never have been able to create before we have been able to create before?
And in fact, in case we can do a cromound?
A cromosome is just a piece of inert material inert.
The speed with which we are able to degitalize the life is growing up to exponential exponential to exponential the way we can deal with the life is growing up with the life is growing that we can degitalize the life is growing the life is growing up to exponential to exponential the life is growing to degitali
Our ability to write the genetic code of genetic code -- rather slowly slowly ly-less.
And our recently results the results the brand on a exponential curve.
We have began more than 15 years ago.
The process has requires a lot of steps of past, as we began to the first experiments.
But we discovered that synthesize DNA is very difficult.
There are thousands of cars in the world that produce small segments of DNA, the long-the-wall--and--a--and--a--side process is longer than the segment is longer than the segment.
So we had to develop a new metom to assembling these fragments and correct the errors.
And this was our first attempt to particularly from the digital information of Phi 174.
It's a little virus that kills batteries.
We have designed the errors and we used the correction of the errors and you get a molecule.
The interesting part is when we took this piece of inert material and we put it into the bacteria and we put it into the bacteria have began to read this genetic code and produce the viral particles and producing viral particles the viral particles and viral particles in the viral particles and we put it into the batteries, the bacteria have inherred batteries, the
The particles are then release in the cells, are coming back and have been back and destructed the Els.
I was talking about recently with members of oil industry says that they have certainly understanding this model.
They have more voice.
We believe that this is a situation where the software can really build its hardware in a biological system in a biological system
But we wanted to do things more in big things in big things.
We wanted to build the whole chromosome.
They're more than 580 mildle code code code --
So we thought of built it in cassets of virus, so that we could change the cassets to understand what the cassets are a living cell.
The design is crucial information is crucial information in a computer, these must be very accurate to be very accurate to it.
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 the standard was a standard of a midle of a mibasic milar basis.
We found it, resequencing -- 30 error sequence, 30 error. We were used that original original to work it.
One of the process is to design segments that you get away with all the other segments that are with all other segments to build under underunit to build under unit in the smaller working together.
We can reach until elements here.
You probably have read that we read the cluster of the phone.
Think about this is -- we have a low-based genetic code on four liter: A, C, and T.
Three of those letting together with about 20 loves, and there's a specific order of lects, and there's a specific order to letter every lominoacid.
So we can use the genetic code to write words, frainty thinking.
What we did at the beginning was automobile to be automobile time.
Some were deluses by the fact that it wasn't poem.
We have designed these segments for simply to unique with the entire segments.
There are employers that repaid and they put them and put them together.
And we started to assembling the particular segments from five to seven my letter to segments to make segments of 24 mildle lects, to get to 72 mild.
At every steps of these segments in abundance so that we are now trying to make a data proceeding that we're trying to create a extraordinary procept -- as you will see in a minute.
We're trying to automatize the process.
So, this looks like the tabon a basis of a basis of a basic player tabellon.
When we go to these very longments very long, more than 100 miles and more more than 100 middle in E.
It's going to get to the instruments of the modern tool.
So we consider other mechanisms.
We knew another mechanism called "recombination, called recombination, which in biology to repaid the DNA degrade to repair the DNA degram of the segments.
Here's an example.
This organism, called the Deinococcus radiodurans, can sources three million rad rad rad radication.
You can see in the high require as his cromosome.
In 12 -- 24 hours is a primatter, as it was primatter.
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do it.
These organisms can be completely driving away.
They can live under you get under it.
They're absolutely certain life exists in space, and you swow, to find new environments of water.
ASA to say the NASA showed that this avview.
This is an image of the molecules that we built using these process, just using these process, using the design appropriate for segments.
The livievil, the lievil.
This image was not taken with a microscope with a microscope -- but with a microscope rule.
It's a very big molecule, so we can see it with a microscope with a law.
These are pictures that cover a period of about six seconds.
This is the published that we did a little time ago.
They're more than 580,000 genetic code genetic code genetic code --
It's the largest molecules that ever created by man.
It has a molecular fish, a molecular heavy on a heavy fish.
If we walk it with a 10 cararacter without spaces, there would be 142 pages to only transck this genetic code this genetic code this genetic code of this genetic code of a type with a type without a types without only to get 142 pages to get 142 pages to transcrive this genetic code this genetic code
Now, how do we do it work? How can we activate it?
Obviously, you love virus is a game game is a game game is a game game is a game game is a game game is a game game is a game to girls.
It's a little bit more complicated when you use the bacteria.
It's also simpler when it's about eucariot as our eucariot as our nucleus to extract the nucleus and insert another one and you get the process of clon.
In the bacteria for the chromosome, is instead of integrated in the cell phone that we are able to do a complete transplant that we are able to do a complete trapiece of a cromosome from a cell and active it.
We purifted a party by a microbial species from a microbial species.
The two are different as men as men as men tough.
We have added some genes in a way to decide what choose to chromother.
The slide with the gases in a way to kill all the proteins.
And when we put it in the cells was stupend -- and you learn our softwo-physticatoes -- the new cromosome is gone in the cell.
And we were thinking that we couldn't go old, but we tried to go over there.
This is one of most exectural mechanisms of evolution.
We found that many species have added a second or a second or a third or a few part, and add a few hundred new tracks in a second or that species.
So who thinks about evolution as a kind of a gene when you get modific is a lot of biology.
There is a restrial restrial called the restrial restrial is that addicts the DNA.
The chromosomes that was in the cell.
The cellula-crop-out crop-ha.
It's expressed and and recognized the other crope as an extract as an extract with only the cells and the new cromoom and the new cromoom and the new cromoom and the new cromoom as an extractly as a extract as a extract of the other crum.
it's became blue blue to the genes that we have inserved it.
And in a short of time, all the feature of a kind of a kind of a kind of gared and it turned from all a new species, the new species, which we put in the new software that we put in the cell.
All the protein are changed, the membrans are changed, and when we read the genetic code genetic code genetic what we transferred you.
Now, this may seems like genetic alter, but altering the software as much as much as much as much as much stancial enough of a sustainal enough of genetic enough.
Now, I explained that you don't talk about genesis -- but to progress from three million years and evolution, and I said that maybe we're doing to create a new version of the Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosion of this digital process of degital with this digital process of digital process of degital process of the digital process of genese.
Why do I this?
I think it's enough obvious when we think about our necessity.
We're going to go from six billion and a half of people in the next 40 billion people in the next 40 years.
I am to give an example, I was born in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for each existent in 194, in 194, there are are going to be four.
We're now now now to find food, water food, water and clean and banity, medicinal and gence, and a half of people.
It will be more harder to do it for us.
We are more than five billion carbon of olian billion barrels.
That means a hundred million bariles a day.
When we try to find biological process, or any kind of process to replace it to replace it to be a huge challenge and to be a huge challenge.
We have to keep it in the CO2 emission, from these materials that finishes in the atmosphere.
At the day day today, thank you to scientific discoveries in the world, we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I like to think that are the design component for the future.
The electronic industry has only one dozen of a dozen of component, and think about how many different things are coming out.
Our limits here are maintain by biological realities and our imagination.
We now have techniques, thank you very quickly in these metodds, to create what we call genomics we call genomics.
We are able to build a big robots that can produce a million chromosomes at a day.
Think of processing these 20 million different genes or to try to get the processes to make more optimize to make more biology or drugs, new vaccines, we can change a little team, and create biology theors now that in the last 20 years of science.
And it's just a standard selefield.
We can choose to choose for chance of survive, or chemistry or charbelong, production of vaccines --
This is an instant instant, some software programmed on which we're working for seats and designing using species to seat and design species in computer.
Well, we don't know necessarily as they wouldn't be not.
We know exactly what their genetic code code --
Now we're concentrate on the urant carbon of fourth generation.
You have seen you see that you extract out of the grand was a finished experiment in the bad.
We have a second realing and third generation that will use enough pretty much more than the higher as wall, as the either than the higher as the either types of butanol.
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without mainly major more more than food and the connection of food and the deavel availability would be to transformate the CO2 in matter materials that we are working on the primble for the primate carbon for the primate carbon of quarter generation in about 18 months.
The solar light with CO2 is a methodom -- but in our discoveries in our world we found different metods.
This is a organism that we described in 1996.
It lives in the ocean deep in about 2500 feet of the water temperature of the water perature of water.
It creates it building with the molecular as a molecular as a source of energy as a source of energy source of energy as a source of energy as a source of energy as a source of energy as a source of energy.
We're trying to understand if we can incanalate the CO2, that can easily be transported by making your bir, convering that CO2 in the urant, to drive this process.
So to inform what we might be able to increase what the basic question of the asking of the basic is Now, versus -- we have the modest oil, and we have the obillion the whole industry.
Exactly. If you can't do it from TED, where you can do?
It would become a major of energy.
And also, we're working for the same metods to create vaccines to create vaccines of instants.
You saw this year with the influence, we're always back to a year and with a dollar and a dollar and a dollar and a dollar vaccine the right --
I think that what you can change build vaccinable to change in the ancient vaccinable in the ancient vaccinable to vaccinable to change in the ancient vaccinable to change in the ancient vaccinable to change in the ancient vaccinable to change in the ancient vaccinable.
That's how the future might start to change it, it looks like to change it, now, the tree of evolution, and addressed by bacteria with bacteria and infinally information with the argue.
We're at so much of the best people.
Our discope is to make enough to try to make it cels to make it. Thank you very much.
First of all I'm going to see the most quickly possible, some work of the new technology that we have taken to Microsoft in the Microsoft in the following water in the follow. This is Seadragon.
It's a environment that you can interact is a local level that remote with a huge amount of visual data --
So we're seeing a lot of photographs of photographs with a kind of a zoom and continuous fast, for a speed landscape and continuous fast, to the images as we want.
And it doesn't matter how big the amount of information that we see, as big as we see as big data or images.
Most are common photographs -- but this for example, is a provenient from the Bilibrarian from the Bilibrary of Congress:
It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that limits the path of a system as this is the number of place in your screen in any moment. It's also an architecture. It's also an architecture.
This is a book, example of data, you don't images.
This is the Dickens. The Dickens. The cool cool represents a capital capital.
To show you that it's just a head of textbook, and we can do something like that, to make a real representation of a representation of the textbook, not a photo.
It could be a little bit of an artificial book.
You don't look at it.
This is an example more realistic example of the Guardian example of the Guardian.
Each image is the beginning of a section.
And it really gives you the pleasure and beauty experience to read the version of a view or a near review or a quotidness of meet.
We also did something with the angle angle of this number of Guardian to Guardian angle of the Guardian angle of this number of the corner.
We created a higher public to high solution -- much higher than what you use in a normal published in a normal publish.
If you want to see the characteristic cartoons, you can see here.
Or other models, or even specific specific specific specific way.
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on the screen on the screen of space on the screen of space on the screen of space on the screen of space to the screen limits on the screen limits of space to eliminate the limits of space to eliminate the screen of
We hope that this means to put up and other poors and other porcheries like that, you don't have to be necessary.
Of course, the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology.
And I don't want to lose time, if not to say that we have contributes to give you a camp.
These are all the way in the U.S. obobjects on a NASA.
So we now now now now now we go to something else.
This is actually actually in the webs; you can go to the webs; you can go to see.
It's a project called a Photosynth, which two different technologies.
One is Seadragon and the other is a very interesting visual computers in Noah Snavely, a student of the University of Washington, with the aid of Steve Seitz of the U.K. and Rick Szee Rick Szews of Microsoft Ricemembrion.
And it's from the web, I was in the web, gest.
You can see when we do this kind of screen -- where we can go from a picture of the image of the kind of experience and have this kind of experience to multiple.
But the space collocasted images here has actually a meaning of a meaning.
The computer visualization of the computer have registen up these images together, in a way that they realized the real-up and the real-away -- all the neighborhood in the Grashi Grashes on Montagging -- you have been taken dogs -- have been taken a slide-show of a slide-show space.
I don't know if I have time to show you some other environment.
There's some more space space
I want to go directly to one of the original data from a previous data from a previous perform of Photosynthy that we did work. So the first time the first time the last time -- to show you what I think I think is really the chief of the technology, the technology technology, the technology -- the technology technology, the technology that we put it in the environments that we put in the web.
We had to worry about the legal ways.
This is a rebuilding in Notare of Notare Dame images from Flickr. Basta digitary to Flickr. Basta digital represents of the types of the field of the field of the field of the represents that you have a picture that you have been discovering that is also appears a picture that it's discovering this model.
So they are all picked up by Flickr and they were all colleged at this way.
And it's possible to navigate in this simple.
You know, I would never have thought of finish to work for Microsoft.
It's very gratifical to receive this kind of accope here.
I think you can see that it's a lot of different kinds of different kinds of photos of those photos in those phoes in those phone professional phone number of SLR, a number of making in this environment.
And if you can tell you about those strange strange.
Most are block from doing it, etc.
She got a few of here is a photographs -- etch.
This is a Notre Dame register of Notare corrects.
We can go from the poster poster to the physics of this environment.
The essential point is that we can do with social environment. This is now taking from all -- from the whole memory of view of view -- and you college all those data together.
All of those pictures become colleged together, more than the particular ses of the particular pictures become colleged together, more than the particular pictures become colleged together, more of the particular pictures,
You have a model of the land that emerge.
Think about this as the moon the Stephen Lawler on the Ter's virtual Earth
It's something that grows in complexity as people use. And they use people us. And that vantages for who use.
Their picture is marched with meters in other people.
If you get the idea of contrash all these many people say the name of the name of Notare of Notare of Notare of Notare of Notare of all those data, and I can use the point of engineering for emmers to be able to use as a point of engine, in that universe, using the space of anybody else, and hava a smooth experience of the kind of recrossmoot, and a cross-smoothuser and cross-s-wallow---wing suspendent experience of the idea of ses-and and and
Of course, a consequence of all of this are extremely elaborated virtual model, not only by viewing on the plane and images and by images and by images and similar images and similar images and similar to collective.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I understand what your software is that your software will conflict us to do is that in the next years, all the photographs -- all the photographs who are going to be practically connect to the whole world will be practiced together?
BA: Yeah. What is doing is in practice.
Shyperlin, if you want to hyperlin, between images.
And it's doing it in the base of the images.
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the recognition that many of these images can education that many of these images can education.
As when you make a research of images on the web, and you give a sentence and the page, has a lot of information about the pictures of the pictures of the pictures of the pictures of the pictures of images on the web is a sentence, you know, when you make a sentence, you know, when you get a web of the web on the web has a lot of information on the web is about the webbbb,
Now, what happens if that picture is a picture of all your photos do?
So the amount of interconnection as it is really enormous and the amount of recycles that is really enormous -- it's a classical effect of the net.
CA: Blaise, it's really amazing.
BA: You thank you very much.
One of the main pleases when you travel and one of the ethnographic research is the power that they have forgotten the anti-tradition, between who has the paster in the wind, the touches in the wine, the skyroll, the setting of the plogy and loating the plant.
Basti thinking that sciamans Jaguarar, or the Milily Way, or that the myths are still still hyths are still mainly significant, or that in Himalayaya, the rest of the Dharmal is still the importance of the antropologia, and the world in which we live live in the world in which we live live livive livive in sense that we live live viewed in sense of reality, but it's a model of reality,
the consequence of a particular choices that our irps of adaptive choices or mal, a lot of generations.
And of course, we all shared the essential tracks.
We all hidden it. We all procreid.
We're dream in the inition of the beginning action.
We have to deal the inexorse of death, so it doesn't surprising us and balliam, and it wallows us --
We all have an art art.
What it is the particular chozons of every culture.
It doesn't matter that they are the Curger of the Borneo, or the Voodoo Haiti, or the Haiti, or the Kaise of Art, or the Kaise of Aug, or a settlya's heart in the heart of the Sahara.
He was my journey in the desert of journey in the desert of yak in the valley, on the game of the world.
All these populations teaching us there are other ways of thinking about existing other ways of thinking, other ways of thinking, other ways of thinking about the world.
And if you reflect a mom, it's a concept that can give you hop.
Aside, the world are the world create a ragnate; the world are a spiritual and cultural life that will fly the planet and it's important for the benither of the planet as the planet as biosphering bioiphers.
And you can think about this raise -- as a cultural ethnos: and you can call the etnos; the total amount of all the conceptic of all the conception, inspirations, inspired intuities, intuition to be from human imagination from the consciousness of consciousness of consciousness --
The ethnos: the amazing patrimoney of human manity.
It's the symbol of what we are and what we can be in as a kind of inquisitive inquisitive.
And as the biosphere was gravly consumed higher than the etness of the ethnose.
No biology, for example, for example, it would be about the horle of the extinction of the extinction of simply because it's falk, or in the most apocality, and you get nearly in the most biological ies -- and not near closer to the most optimistic cultural ipoods.
The indical thing is, of course, the perss of the language.
When you were there were 6,000 languages on this planet.
One language is not just by a vote vote or a vocabulary or from a series of gram rules.
One language, it's the spray-human spirit spirit of human spirit spirit language.
It's the meeting with the animal of every culture is in the material world in material.
Every lingua forest of mind, a wine, a wine, a thinking, a though though, a spiritual system of spiritual possible system.
And of those 6,000 languages, as we sat at at Monterey, at least half the half is not sussurrounded in the ears.
They don't get teacher to children, which means less not walking to be less than you walk already to you.
What is more trister than being flight by the silent to talk about the last to talk about a language of a language of transmit the wisdom or to the promise of the daughter?
This is a sky's state of somewhere in some part of the world every two weeks of a few weeks a well and with skills in the tombs of a ancient language.
And I know that somebody is going to say "Is it it "Is it not better like this?
The world wouldn't be a better place if we all let the same languag?" Beny; we talk all yoruba. We all talk about the yuba.
Let's talk about kogi.
You will find a track thing means not to talk about your language.
I would like to give you a journey through the etnishes --
a little journey in ethnosed to give you a little journey of what we're loging.
Most of us forget that when I say "different different ways of existing existing of exist.
Let's take for example, this bimbo Barasan Amazonia in Amazonial Swinner of the anaconda, that creates to come from the river, which creates of the best sacride.
It's a popular that is not able to distinguishing the blue blue blue blue from the green green because the celest, and the popular popul.
They have a strange language and a mathemates and mathematic, "English language, "Should you be a person that talks about a person that the language.
All has radicated in the mythological past, all the particularity is that in these families are talking about six or seven languages in which are talking about a bad mathembes no practice language.
They listening to listening and then they start talking about.
Let's take one of the most interesting tribes with which I lived in the Waoranananers of Ecuador that had the first contact that had the first contacts in 1958.
In 1957, five missionary missionarian contact contact a fact that a facal error made.
They made it from the high to the photographs that were retent that they were done to love that popular population that popular popular of the forest of the forest of the forest of the forest of the forest of bi-dimensional forest of the photograph that they were never seen anything of the photographs that were going to be able to be able to be able to love that the popular well of the master forest forest forest that they were done in the mains of the popul
They collected the photograph from the ground, they have a researching or a shape or a figura -- they have concluded that was the diable, and they killed the diabole, and they killed the five missionarian with the skys.
But Waorans didn't kill the strange of the strangers.
They kill them between them.
54 percent of mortality was because of their own own own own their own own own own own own own own own own own own own mortality.
We are rising to eight generations and we found two natural housed and when we insisted for knowledge that one of them was a lot of that was a lot of mind that was dead that has been dead, and then they killed it neighborhood and then they killed the same.
The cactors were able to recognize the urine south from 40 and recognize the species.
In the early '80s, I was assigned a really interesting when my professor of Harvard to the Harvard to go to Haitt to intrupholars between the society and the power of Duvalier and Tonton Macoutes, and Tonton Macoutes, and imposed to make the glassesesessing for the zoms.
To give a sense to a sense of miracle, I should understand the Vodoun't, and that the Voodom is black nera.
It's a fairly of a complex metaphop.
Very interesting.
If you ask you to tell the big religions of the world, what would you say?
Cristian Islam, Buddhy: Exbris:
A continent is always left out of the sub-Saharan Africa, and the sub-Saharan Africa, and and the Voodoo and the Voodoo is not the distilled of these religious concepts of napslavery to the deep.
What makes you interesting in your voodoo is the intense reports between life and life more.
So you see the spirits.

This level of intuition is extremely important.
When we think about the inner populations and the environment we ask Rousau and the old story of the noble history of the noble history of the maybe we ask Thororeffort and we say that these popules are closer than the Earth of us.
The indigenes are not feeling none is under the nest of our algives from our algia.
There's no space for these things in the malarian of Asmat the Asmat the gelides or wish of the Tibet, but the near basic of the Earth doesn't have to be a basic concept of the Earth is not a near to be in the most under concept that the Earth can live because it's infusing by concept that the human concept is not a realizing of human being.

Now it's the beauti: the better, the better, which is in this books, and in this lian inbitors of the same kind of neuble-to-thyetic question of 80,000 species of plants, like these popules -- like these popules are going to find two morphologically not similar died with a great, but if you get a lot of a biochemistry that is a very much of the particular onger than the particular bor to the particular be?
We use the big euphenical euphemism and the error, which can be revealed to be revealed with it.
But if we ask to Indian are going to tell us "The plants speak about year."
What do you want to say,
This tribes, Cofan, Cofan, 17 variety of ayax, that they distinguished in the forest in the forest forest in the forest species.
If we ask them how they are stablish their tassonomy will tell you about it, and I thought I understand of plant, and I said, "I think I rest it "No."
The solution is -- you take 17 variety in a night and each night and each night and each other.
With you don't have to Harvard, but it's much more interesting that we count the starting stames.
Now, the problem is that also the problems is that also have heart the people who have heart the people who have heart patches and in some way to our realities of the story respect to our real world and pasts in our real world and spend
In fact, the XX century, between 300 years, it will not reminded for his wars or its innovations or innovations of technological innovations and we have stopped and we have stopped and we have been instopped in the destruction of biological diversity and cultural diversity and cultural diversity is not the change.
All cultures through the century are involved in a dance for new possibility of life.
And the problem is not the technology.
Indians Sioux is not stopped to be Sioux when they put out of the Americans have been stopped by Americans don't have stop to Americans have put out of the caves and hot and calm.
It's not the change or the technology that they threat the integrity of the ethnofera.

As the genocide of a popul, the physics of a popul, is convicted to universal level of a popul, but the ethnocide of a popul, not only is convicted in certain the ways, because it makes part of the development.
And you can't understand the Tibet of Tibet until you get out of the beginning.
I lost the 6,000 miles from Chengdu in China in West Cina West through Tibet Tibet with a young girl, and I realized what we feel to Lhasa I understand what we feel talking about, but only what we feel talking about.

The big anthropologiogue Margaret Mead, before he died that his greatest was that in our world, not only we will see the whole gamm of the world, not just see the whole gamma of human imagination of human imagination of thinking about thinking about thinking about thinking about thinking about it, but a day we will see it more possible other possible possible to be a device.
And it's upon to remember that our species is exist for 600,000 years.
The Neolith Rvolution that has given us the agriculture, that has done to the cult of the seeds of the slide of the slide with the skygerarchia of the clerarchia of specialization, and we talk about 10,000 years ago.
The modern world has been 300 years old.
That slide story doesn't suggest that we have the answers to all the challenges that we have the answer to come in a thousand and we will face in a thousand
When these myriades of the world is asked what to say to be human being, availed with 10,000 voices different.
And it's in these answers that we all all riscover the possibility of what we love to be what we love with with the popular and all the gards. And there are big time and all the yards. And there are big moments of optimism.
I took this picture on the north of Britisland of Britisland when I went to hune with the Inuit, and this man, Olaya, and I told the wonderful story of his grandfather.
The canades is not always as a company and the people in the population and in the '50s, to be able to live our maintained them in colonies.
The grandfather of this man came up to go and set to go.
The family, temping for his life, and he took all the arms, and all his attres.

We want to talk about caving it with nothing?
In the aprise of 19999 government canadeses has reliated to the Inuit by the Inuit of a territory of the California and Texmed Texas a and Texmultiple of the Texas a broken government.
It's their new patria. It's called Nunavoid Nunavut.
It's a territory independent. They are all the resources.
One of a beautiful example of how a national nation-state nation-state nations.

156 Pathese, they transmit our television television
Our review from millions of people.
Our work is traveling in the ethnos: the world of the wonderful cultural place that will go through which they are going to be a lot of the way that they saw it -- they will hope, you hope, and they will be able to reveal the central world of existing in the world of existing in the world in a plug plug in a pluralist, and must be a multical pluralist,
in which the wisdom of all the popules can contribute to our benefit to our benefit to our benefit to our benefit to our benefit to our wisdom to our benefit into our well.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you about some things that I wrote in this book, which I hope to be able and to try and evidening some collegments, in the case doesn't have any ntastes.
I want to start with what I call "the offical."
Can offical dog, officer of thing?
The offical officer of all the West society is Western offical dog, "If we want to massimizing the well-being of our citizen." "The way to make it is to male freedom, to be to massive the freedom."
The reason for a side, in the fact that the freedom is in the liberty is precious to human beings.
On the other is that if we are free, each of us can act to just connect to do everything that massive our benefits, without any one that decided in us.
The way to massimize the free is to male the choice.
More people choices people are liber, more liber, and more is their free liberty, more is their well.
These are right. And it's so deeply to put it in society that no one is going to put it into a two-foot society that no one is a depth of it,
And it's also deeply radicated in our lives.
I'm going to show you some examples of what progress has repossible.
This is my supermarket. It's not particularly big things.
I allowed a simple named on condition.
In my supermarket are 175 conments, without contaring 10 variety of olive olive olive and 12 acets and 12 acets that you can buy to give you a huge number of condition, which no one of the 15 instances in the circumstances that no one of the 15 already already already onto be a huge number of of olivariety that you can get a huge number of 12 across the bals;
Here's the supermarket.
Then you go to the snegotio to buy a stere: CD, slettor CD, radio, the CD, radio broken --
And in this single negotial of electronic component is a big number of components.
We can make six million different and a half of different combinations using the component that there are in one negotid.
You have to love that there is a lot of choice.
Other sample: the world of communications.
One times when I was a child, you could get all the services of the desired, and they were wished by mamma Bell.
He wood, you didn't bought the phone --
One consequence of that, with the one one was that the telephone doesn't rop.
These are these days are gone.
Now we have a variety of telephone almost illitated phone of the phone cells.
Here's the future.
My favorite is what the MP3, MP3, cut, and the hidden and the hand for the nase,
If you do not have seen in the negotic negotic negotic below you to prey revery.
And what happens is that people come in the negozes and it does this question. And you know what is the answer is "No."
It's not possible to buy a cellphone that doesn't make too much things.
So, in other aspects of life that are much more important than the water of the water is the same explosion of choice.
Assistance healtharia: not happens in the United States that you go from the doctor and the doctor you have to do.
Instead, you go to doctor, and the doctor says, "Okay, we could do A, or B" "A, we might do it?" "A has these benefit and these risks. And these risk and these risks.
You say, "Dr. What would I do?"
And the doctor says, "As these goods, and these risk." And what these risk."
"What do you want to do?"
And you can rebate and said, "Dr. If she was going to do?"
And the doctor, "But I am not lei."
The result is called the malato," as the malato," expression that makes it seems a beautiful thing.
But in fact, it's not that one swow, and responsibility to take decisions from somebody who knows anything that you know anything about -- and somebody else -- and almost certainly is -- and so in the ideal conditional decisional to take decisional decisional to take the patient decisional to take the patient decisions that that it is the doctor.
There's a lot of marketing products of drugs, and direct to people like me and you, if you think about it has no sense, that we can't buy it it anything that we can't buy it.
But if we can't buy it it, why do you publish?
The answer is that they want you doctor, we call the doctor to change the recipe of changing the recipe of the recipe of the recipe of the recipe is that we want to change the recipe of the doctor is that we want to change the doctor to make the recipe of change.
So we have a fundamental instance, as our identity has a choice, as you see in this view in this view of the children. We don't want to form their feeling to the right right now.
And we can reinvented us how many times we can reinvent.
That means that every morning to the risk that every morning to you decide that kind of person.
Remempt to the family and mathematic, a time prospective of the communicable point, and it was that you can get the most pretty much as you can get the most pretty possible.
The only real choice was with choice was with choice -- and not what to do later.
Ogame day, everything is really to play.
I mean, very smart students and I think about 20 percent in less of work in less than a time.
And because they are not less brilliant because they are less less diligent.
But why I'm impensive to ask you, I said, "I would have to do it now?" I should do it now?"
"Do I would be a little bit more you to think before the kids or career?"
They're interrogative interrogative --
And they are trying to answer these questions, even if this imply doesn't completely the compites that they are not to get a voice with my exam.
And they have to really do it. They're really important questions.
Now, the work: we're lucky, as Carl underunderwater -- because the technology allows us to work every day, every day, every day, from every corner of the planet, tranne from Hotel Randolph.
To parents -- there's a corner and I don't tell anybody where, where the Wii works.
I don't say that because I want to use it.
What does that mean, this incredible liberty liberty that we have to work on the work? Is that we have to decide, and just in every moment, if we have to work or not.
We can go to see our phone hot, with the cell phone tas, Blackberry in the high, and the newspaper and the newspaper in the kney.
And even though they're all speaking that we see our son that we see our son wind the game, we are also asking this called called "I have to answer this called the "Do you answer this called this?"
"I have to get to this email? I got to abbook?
And even when the answer is "no," all this makes experience the experience of your son is very differently from what would be been in other conditions.
So, from any side we look at it, little things and large and big objects and big materials and life, life is a choice.
Once the world was this: Of course, there were some choice, but it was, it was a choice.
The world today is like this, the dilemma is -- "I’s a positive thing or negative, or negative, or negative, or negative.
The answer is She's going to be there.
The positive late them all of the negative negative negative negative negative negative slides.
All this choice has two negative effects.
The first prim, paralysis, is that they produced paralysis that liberation.
With a lot of options that you choose to make it.
I offer an example meaning: a study -- a study conducted on the plans of volunteer volunteers.
One of my colleagues in the Vanker of Vanker companies of thought, with about a million cliently cliently clients in 2,000 different companies.
What she found is that for every 10 solutions that are going to offered up in more more than the percentage of adesion.
With 50 sources there is 10 percent in less than they are available when they are available only 5.
Because with 50 sources that choice, is malezed to decide, and the choice is remained to demate in the inomers.
And at the questions, and asking questions, and of course, is not to get there.
You know that not only means that these workers will eat vast vecting food for cans because they don't have money, they will also say that the decision is so ostics that the decision is so ostics that lost the fundamental data that lost the foundation of work.
Not to talk about the word of the work, they are lost to 50,000 dollars a lot of work, that would be well a lot of the art to the art them.
So the paralysis is a consequence of having too much choice.
And I think it's the world like this.
"And finally, for the eternitity: "ketchop, or mainor maion?"
You would just take the right decision is to take the right decision, if it's for the age age of age, right?
You don't want to choose the wrong source, and nep, and the wrong condition.
So this is the first effect. The second is that even if we can avoid the paralysis and make a choice, at least we are less with less of how we would be with less and less of the choose of how we would have been chood.
And this for different reasons.
One of these is that with a lot of conments that you would have a lot of choose, and it's not easy to imagine that you might have a choice, and that you might have been better than it as a lot of a different choice, and what happens is that the alternative imagined imagine, and the remains the choice, and the remains of choice, and the remained decision that you would have been going on on the decision of the choice,
even when a great decision.
More choices that are more easy to slightly any detail, which is insoddden that is insodds.
Inoless there is what economists call cost-opportunity.
Dan Gilbert asked very well stamacine as the value of the value of things that we confrontive on what we confrontive to the confrontive of what we confrontive it.
On the way there are many options of options, is easy to represent the alternative characteristic characternative scart and be less sodden ly.
Here's an example. I sent with all those who are not New York.
But it's what you probably think you probably think.
There's this couply to Hamptons.
A place of lusely.
It is splended. It's all a day. It's all for them.
Not nothing. But what he thinks is "Well, maledi: "Well, males."
"All my neighbors in Manhattan are vie."
"I could talk about the front of the front of home."
And it turns two weeks from the idea that is lost persing -- every day -- every day -- every day -- the possibility of parking where you want.
The cost-opportunity decrease the cost, which we have, even when the choice is excellent that we have, even when the choice was excellent of it.
And more the opportunity that we have to look at the more characteristics will be returned against how it cost-opportunity.
Here's another example.
This view says a lot of things.
We talk about the moment and maybe the live moment, and maybe of the live slowly.
But the most important point is that anything you choices you choose it doesn't make others.
The things that we don't choose have a lot of four active attrole what we do.
Third point: growing spiral growing of expectative.
I tried on my skin my skin a couple of jeans.
I was almost always jeans.
Once jeans were a only type, and they were bought to best, and they were best, only after they best, only hundred them a lot of a lot of times, they were beginning to go well.
So I went to buy a new time that the old ones were gone, when the old people were gone, and I said, "I need a couple of jeans, this is my cute."
The coming said, "You want you to slim up, slim and slim and fit?"
You want to do you want to do you to the point or bottonight? "Stoney, or "hed?
"You want to do you want to do this?"
"Soth eight you want to get the blaway or stretching -- -- "Way it was --
I was sleep, and after a little I was able to say, "I want to want the kind of charg, which was the only typo." He didn't have any idea of what I was so I I was going to have to be a jeans, then then he came out of the negotie, with the best jeans, and then I was the best jeans that I had ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever work, with the best jeans that I had ever been able to say, "jeans that I would have to say, "Deans,
It was the mas. She was a little choice had a basis.
But I felt it worst it.
Why? I wrote a book to understand it.
The reason I was worst worst is that with all that choice were alties with all my aspectations were altised to be perfects.
And I was a minime. I didn't expectations of expectations when you existed a type, but when you see 100 though, at least a kind of a kind of a kind of a perfect.
What I had water was good -- but not perfect.
After I was talking about what I was trying to get to insound with what I was trying to confront in confront to expectative.
The add options in life of people don't for, to increase the expectations that these have respectable to excellent the stand.
And this will produce less soddisftion, even when the results are good ons.
No one in the world of marketing makes it content.
Because if you know what I'm talking about, you know, you know,
The truth is more like this.
"You was better when he was worst when he was worst when you were worst in which he was worst when you was worst in the worst of the sources was still possible to meet the surprised sources pleaseas.
Ogame day, in the world where we live -- opulent, industrialized by the waiting for the perfection -- the massive thing we can hope is that the things are in the waits.
You never have surprised pleasant because your vostands expectative, and they are ingiant ingigant.
The secret of happiness -- what's here -- is "Baspect." "Yes, you want to see it it mean."
I want to say -- small moment authobiographic -- that I was really unamazing and my wife is really stupen.
I would not have any better, I didn't have any better,
But you don't always have a bad thing.
And finally, a consequence of jeans as a couple of jeans when there's only that kind of jeans is that when you are not satisfied and you ask "Why?"
"Who is responsible to her, the answer is clear to it.
The world is responsible. What would I do that?
When there are hundreds of jeans, and you buy a insodds, and you get a responsible who is responsible to who is responsible as you are in responsible as you are you.
You might be able to do better.
With hundreds of variety available -- there are no wall.
So when people take decisions, even if the result is valized, you feel sentimed and they feel insods, and they make the same.
In the last years the depression is exploded in the industrialized world
I think a master makes -- not the unique, but important -- not the unique, but of this depression is that people have experiences because the standard standard is too high.
And when they have to explaining this situation thinking that the colp is there.
So the final result is that in general we're working about, but we feel worst it --
Let me leave you to get there.
This is the offical dog, what we all take for good and it's completely false. It's really not true.
There's no two-bought that a little bit of choice is better that I don't have a lot of choice, which is better than a lot of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit better than a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a choice is better than I haven't dealing a lot of choice.
There's a critical value critic, but I don't know what it is.
But I'm sure that we have super-secure that we have super-piece level that the best choices our life.
Now, from the political point of view -- I almost finished -- from the police, the follow.
What allows you all this choice in the industrial society is the material rerich society.
There are many places in the world, and you know that the problem isn't that they have too much choice.
The problem is that they have too much fall.
So the face that I'm talking about is a malesclusive to the modern, which is a Western society.
And what makes you depress and arrabbing is this: Steve Levitt told you about the expensive and as a seat and comfortable to be involved by us.
I want to say that these choices, complicated and dispend and it's not that they are just involved useful.
They're the deleted deletes.
They make worse.
If you have a little bit of what in our society allows allows was reversated in those where people have too pounds that they have too poor better than us.
This is what economists call a better paretian paretian paretian paretian economists called a park.
One redict of the reddata is well -- not just to the poor -- not just to poor -- because of this choice in except that we go back to us.
To concluder, you can become everything you want, you can become everything that I --
You know, people are culture, you think, "But what does that weight weight is?"
"It's obvious that you can't make anything in a vetroom of glass --
"As a couple of the world."
and I have interpretty much about this, at the beginning.
But then, though, and I realized that that weight the long.
Because the reality of facts is that if you sent it manage the mouse that you can say, "everything is possible." You don't get the free paralysis.
If you rop the mouth that everything become possible to deminate the sodddiscovered the sodden sodd.
You can get the paralysis, and you reduce the benefit out.
They all need a sphere.
This is almost certainly too strected, perhaps even for us.
But the absence of some symbolic symbolic infelicity for infelicity -- for the room of the inner broken income and wind.
Thank you very much.
