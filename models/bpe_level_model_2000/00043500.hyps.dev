Last year I showed these slide to demonstrate that the glacial calot, which for almost three million years has had had the size of 48 million years had had the size of 48 percent.
However, the gravity of the gravity of the problem because it doesn't show the of.
The glacial clean is in a sense of a sense of global climate system.
You expands of the winner and the summer.
The next slide is going to be a rapid of the last 25 years.
The gaus lost are signed in red.
As you see, they expanding to the blue scream.
This is the ice in the winter, which is the summer.
You can see that the so-called the glacious glacia, five or more, it's like the blood of the body.
In 25 years has spent like this.
This is a problem because it's interested climbing terraining around the ocean arctic where there are enormous amount of carbon that sheets of carbon that microbies.
Respare to the totality of the atmospheric pollution of global warming, that amount could doubling this point.
In some laka little deep deeper in Alaska metan is already bubbling from the water.
The professor. Katey Walter the University of Alaska has recated team, a team at the bottom of a team.
Video: Wow! Al Gore: She's good. The question is whether we're going to be us.
A reason is that this exchange is that the Greenland the Greenland from the north.
This is a river.
The brought had never reached levels.
This is the Kangerlusaq, in the south of the Greenlands.
If you want to know how the level of the sea level of the sea level, here is where the sea level.
These corrups are increasing rapidly.
On the other side of the planet, the largest block of the planet.
And last month, the scientists have declared that the balance of the ice is in negative, and that Antarcts, that Antarcts, which is particularly rapid, is particularly rapid.
Which is a six feet level, like Greenlevel.
On Himalaya, the third biggest block of ice, you see new lakes, that few years ago were ice.
The 40 percent of the world's population in the middle water.
Sulle Ande: this glacier is the source of this city.
The brought is increased.
But when he diminutes, the same thing happens at the water.
In California, the snow on the Sierra Nevada is decreased by 40 percent.
The drill is crisis.
The predictions, like you've read.
The growing security in the world leads to a remarkable increasings.
The environmental disasters are increasing to a rhythm and without precedent.
Four times more numbers in the last 30 years.
This is an unsustainable.
If you look at it in the context if you can see the consequences.
In the last five years we added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the oceans every day.
Look at the Eastern Pacific Pacific Pacific and the parts of the continent, where there's a radical impositional impoveriment in the oceans.
The major of global warming, together with deforestation, together which is the 20 percent, is the use of fossil fuels.
The oil is a problem, and the charcoal is even worse.
The United States are one of the two countries, together with China.
And it proposed to build a lot of other carbon.
But we're seeing a change of direction.
These are the annual projects in the last few years and some of the alternative alternative.
Anyway, there's a politics in our country.
The carbon industries and the oil industries have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote clear carbon that clean, which is a oxxium.
The image reminded me reminded me --
Natal, in the Tennessee, where there's been a 3.8 billion liths of carbon.
Maybe you have seen it on the news.
This is the second largest flow in America.
It's happened around Natal.
The natalian publish of one of the carbon industries was this.
Video: Frosty carbon is a charge and happy.
It's pretty much in America, and it makes our economy.
Frosty the carbon.
It's about price, adorable and workers keep the workers.
Al Gore: From here is a part of the West Virginia.
The largest societies on the mountains is Massey Coal. This is his administrator.
Video: Don Blkenship: I'm going to be clear -- Al Gore, Harry Reid -- they don't know what they're talking about.
Al Gore: So the Alliance for the Proteam of Clima has launched two countrys.
This is one of it.
Video: All right: At we see the climate changes like a threat to our business.
So our priority is to invest a large amount of money in a public effort to make public and confuses the truth,
In fact, the carbon is not sport.
We think it's cleaned -- it's also a good refum.
So not previous about climate changes.
Let me do to us.
Video: All right: Carbone clean -- you have heard a lot of it.
So let's take a turn into a structure of the clean to the carbon.
Straordinarily! The machines are a little noisy, but this is the sound of technology.
The coal of carbon is between the main causes of global warming, but the remarkable technology of carbon that you see changes everything.
Take a look at the technology: this is the technology.
Al Gore: Finally, the positive alternative is connected to the economic security.
Video: Comment: The America is in the crisis, the national safety crisis.
The move that colleagues all the way our dependences the fossils, like the fossil fuels.
Now, there's a new solution for using circumstom.
America: 1,000 percent of clean energy in 10 years.
A plan to reput America in work, to make sure you, and to help stopping the global warming.
Finally, a solution that you have to solve our problems.
Repower America. Scover. You practice.
Al Gore: This is the moment.
Video: Comment: It's about reing energy to America.
One of the fastest enabling of the dependences that kill our planet.
And the future is here. The future is here. Ree, only a new network.
Something about 2: Noves investment for places of well-retribits.
M: Repower America. It's time to be realists.
Al Gore: A proverbable African proverbial says, "If you want to go fast, go to the sun.
If you want to go away together."
We have to go very quickly.
Thank you very much.
Last year at TED fect a introduction on LHC.
And I promise to go back to how the machine.
So here I got it. And for those who are the other time, the LHC is the biggest scientific experiment -- 27 kilometers.
Her is to realize the conditions that were present less than a billion second of the universe -- until 600 million times a second.
This is simply environment.
This is the underneath Gineva.
We picture these mini-Big Bang Big Bang Big Bang Big Bang Big Bang Big Bang Big Bang Big Bang West.
This is what I work. It's called ATLAS -- it's large-foot diameter and has a 22 meters.
This is a spectacular image.
The 10 ses of the last year we have access to last year.
And this picture was taken by ATLAS.
because of immenses in control.
It's a picture of the first picture of particles that had done all over the LHC, and deliberately, deliberately, with a part of the LHC, and spread particles.
In other words, when we see that pictures the machine, we realized that the machine, which is a great life.
I don't know if it was to exult us to do that, when somebody went to Google and saw that the beginning was this.
That means that we had a cultural impact beyond that scientific impact.
About a week later, there was a problem with the machine, they had to these sleeps here -- these dorates.
These files bring 13,000 prints when the machines works at the massive power.
Now, the technicians between you look at files and say, "It's not true. It's not true. It's not true.
And instead they can do it because when they are very cold, they get the superconvictors.
So, at less 271 degrees, at a higher temperature of the space between the stars, these movies can bring that body.
And in one of the most of the magnets in the LHC, there was a defect deft.
So the movies surround up and the 13,000 prints suddenly meeting an electrical resistance.
This was the result.
Now, this is even more impressing if you think that these magnets fish than 20 tons, and they moved about 30 centimeters.
They are damaged about 50 magnets.
We needed to get them and what we did.
We've got them and add it.
They are now returns out all the underground.
By the end of the LHC is going to be again.
We're going to accenate it, and we expect of the data or him, and keeping so our adventures to discover what are the mattones that are the universe.
Now, of course, in a certain place, these accidents reaccepting the debate about the value of science and engineering. It's easy to conflict. It's eeasy to confuture.
I think that the fact that it's so difficult to go beyond the limits, I think this is the value of things like LHC.
I want to conclude with the words of an Ingless, Humphrey Davy, Humphrey Davy, who, in defense of his clean was Michael Faray, he said, "No Michael Faray, he said, "No it is much dangerous for progress of the human mind of the human mind that there are no mysteries that are definitive, and there are no mysteries in nature,
Thank you.
I want to start to ask you to rethink about that, by a children, you played the morning.
While you understand how to reach them and reaching them and to reach them and moving them and moving them to think about and solve problems and solving relationships.
The reasoning is deeply connected to the way that we understand part of the world around us.
So, as an information inspired by our interaction with physical objects with physical objects, together to my collaborator Jeevan Kalaniths, I started to ask my: "And if you use a computer, instead of having the mouse of the mouse of the mouse of the mouse of the mouse as well.
and standing it to our please?
The question was so interesting that we had to explore the answer, building the Siftable.
In a few words, a Siftable computer interactive, like a great discover.
In a few words, a Siftable computer interactive, like a great discover.
You can move them with the hand, they can see it, they can see their movement and have a screen and have a screen and a wireless.
But about, they're physical objects, like myself matter to be able to move it.
The Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem of tools for manipulate information.
And as we become more physics, aware of the movement, of the other, others, and as they become more physics, conscious than we can exploring their movement, of how we motion, we can explore the new tils.
I'm going to start with some simple example.
This Siftable is configured to show the video if you includes it in a direction, the video will go back to the other side back.
These interactive riticians are aware of others.
And if they are interested in what they are interested in what they are going to do.
If they are surrounds, notice and they can drive a little bit.
If they are surrounds, notice and they can drive a little bit.
They also have their movement.
And then we realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was the power to use gestures in the data as if it was a liquid.
In this case, we have three configurated Siftable configurs and I can use them to the color in the central central central to the color.
and I can use them for the color in the central central color, where they mix.
If we're going to get a little bit, we can get a little bit of it.
It's also beautiful possibilities of learning, like languages, the mathematics and logical games of logics where people can prove things, and see the result.
I'm --
This is a sequence of Fibonacus that I do with a program of equations.
Here we have a words of words that half between Scarabeo and Boggle.
Basically, to every turn Siftable, you get a house on every Siftable, Pratratically, to every turn Siftable, and while you try to get words on a dictionary.
Then, after about 30 seconds remissing, and you have a new set of reading and new possibilities.
Thank you.
Here's the children who came to the Media Lab, I did so that they tried them and I did a video.
They are pleased.
And one of the interesting things about this kind of application is that you don't have to give people a lot of education.
You just have to say, "Compons of words, and they know exactly what to do.
Here's what other people trying to do it.
This is our most youngest bete, there.
He just wanted to get them.
They're just going to be put, for him.
Now, this is an application of a interactive.
We wanted to build a tool of the Lui is Felix.
It can inserve new characters in the scene, soiling the Siftable their associated associators.
It can inserve new characters in the scene, soiling the Siftable their associated associators.
So, it's doing the sun.
Video: The sole is surgery.
David Merrill: She brought a treat the scene.
Video: The treat.
Bel work!
So schooling the Siftable and put them close to make the characters --
Video: Bau!
-- by inventing their story.
Video: Ciao!
DM: It's a story with an open-open-opened story,
DM: It's a story with an open-open-opened story,
Video: Video: See,
DM: The final example I have time to show you is a tool, realized recently, to sampion, to sample and equaling music.
It's an instrument, realized recently, to sample and executting music.
The Siftable here active sound like the battery.
Every one of these has four different variations, and you can choose that us.
You can indesert these sounds in a sequence to comport in a sequence.
And to do it simply it making a sound and a "sequence" and a "sequence."
These are effects that you can control from living, like revering and the filter.
Lattacks to a particular sound and then including it.
And then there are the general effects like time and volume, which apply to apply the whole sequence.
Let's look at how it works.
Video: DM: We're going to start putting a base in two Sift" "sequence" -- we're going to be add the extended in a series, we add other base.
Now I put a lower line.
Video: DM: Now, I add to the use --
Video: DM: And I'm going to put the bacteria, so I can control the effect.
Video: I can run the whole sequencing the whole sequencing time from one side or the other.
Video: DM: And I'm going to add the movie to give more expression.
Video: DM: I can recombining the sequence,
So I don't have to planned it before, but I can improvise, make it longer.
And now, finally, I can get the whole sequence including the whole sequence including Siftable "volume."
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is to build new interface machines like our brains work.
And today, I had time to show you one of the results of the results and also some possibilities that we try to bring out of the lab.
The concept that I want to transmit you is coming this new generation of objects to interact with digital media that will bring information in our world in the way we want.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the hour of talking to all of you.
They're a writer.
It's a professional books is my profession, but it's more than that, obviously.
It's also the love and the fasr of my life.
And I don't expect that can change.
But, you know, something particularly happened in my life, and in my career, that brought me to get the whole relationship with this work.
The particular thing is that I recently recently written this book, this biography called "Mangia, Ama" whatever, in my previous books, for some reason in the world and became a great sensition in the world and became a big sense of interaction.
And the result is that everywhere now, people are treating me as though they were convicted to me.
You true -- convicted away.
Do they all worried and they say, "Don't you fear no longer to do better?
You're not afraid to continue to write the whole life without could be able to create a book that can be able to make somebody?"
that can matter somebody?"
It's remaining, you know.
But it could go worse, part of that I remember 20 years ago, when I started to say to people -- I was an adolescent -- I wanted to be a ritice.
I would met against the same reaction.
And people told me, "Don't be able to have succeed?
Don't you fear that the humiliation of kill you do?
Don't you fear to do this mester for all life without anything that is going to die out and to die on a headquarters of dresssed with the mouth of loving seters?"
You know, you know.
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is, "Yes."
I fear of all those things.
I always had fear.
And I also fear of a lot of other things that people should not be.
As an alga and other things.
But what I think about the writing what I thought and I would ask myself, why is?
Is it rations?
It's logic that anybody has to expect to be frightened by a work that you feel to do it.
But what is that particularly in employed creative to make them about mental health in a way that other careers in a way that other career doesn't do?
How my father, for example, he was an engineer and I don't remember one time in his 40 years of activities where he was asked if it had to be afraid if it had to be engineering?
There was never -- that this block of John, like this?
Don't work?
Onestly, chemical engineers like group don't have certainly in the centuries, the reputing reputing the reputing reputing maniacs.
We have enough, we have enough this reputation, and not just writers, but creative, we have this reputation of being enormously instable.
And it's not going to look at the bottom of the deaths of the magnific deaths that just in the 20th century, they die and often for hand.
And the ones who are not suicide seem to be really, by their womans.
Norman Mailer, first of die, in the final interview, my book had killed me a little bit of a little more." A extraordinary business about their life.
But we don't get that when we heard this because we heard these so longer than in some way we have completely interished and accepted the notion that the creativity and the suffering and suffering are in some way and the arts, it will always conduct it to the angood.
And the question I want to ask to all of the today is, are you agree with this idea?
It goes you do this -- because even watching it from a centimeter of myself is not good for anything that supposed to myself.
I think it's hat.
And I think it's also dangerous and I don't want to see it in the next century.
I think it's better to encourage our big minds to live.
And certainly I know in my case -- in my situation would be very dangerous to begin to that feeling toward of the circumstances where I'm in my career.
You know, it's pretty young, it's pretty young, I have about 40 years.
I still have about four work in me.
And it's very likely anything that I'm going to write from the world as the work that was going to be right by the world as the work that was going to write after the last book.
I'm going to be sky, because we're all more or less friends here -- it's likely my greatest success is to my greatest success.
Oh, Gesus, that though!
You know, this is the kind of thought that brings a person to start to begin the morning, and I don't want to do it.
I would refer to do this work that we have.
So, the question become, what?
And so it seems to me after a lot of reflections, that the way to work is to create a psychological psychological psychological psychological psychological psychological psychologist.
I have to somehow to find a safety distance between me, I am write, and my natural anxiety on what reaction is going to be able to get E, while I try to get it through time, trying to find some other societies about how to do it to see if they could have some other societies to see if they could have the best ideas.
how to helping people creative to helping people, emotional risks of creativity.
And that research took me to the ancient Greea and Rome.
Sguitems because it turns back.
In the ancient Greea and ancient Rome -- people didn't seem to believe that creativity came from men, OK?
She thought the creativity was that the creativity is that they dived to men from a few surrounds, and unknown reasons, and unknown reasons and unknown.
The Greeks calls these spirits of creativity.
Socrates, wonderful, believed to have a demon that elargiving wisdom,
The Romans were of the same idea, but they called spirit kind of spirit without a genius.
which is great, because Romans didn't really think that a genius was someone particularly intelligent.
They believed that a genius was this kind of divince that had literally lived in the walls of an artist, a bit like the Dobby, and that came out of the artist, and that came out of the artist, and modeling the result of that work.
Except -- here is the distance of which I talk -- that construct psychological psychological that protected you from your work.
And everyone knew that was that worked, right?
So the ancient artists were protected by certain things, like the too narcism, right?
If your work was exceptional, you couldn't take all the market, everybody knows that they had been helped by this incorpore."
If your work failure, it wasn't all of your job, right?
Everybody knew that was your genius.
And so people handed the creativity in Occident for a long time.
Then the Rinasciment came and all of this great idea; we put this great idea; we put the human being to the center of the universe and the mysteries and no longer space to the creatures of the divinity.
This was the principle of humanity and people began to think that creativity came to think that creativity came completely by the issue of human.
And for the first time in history, it began to reference or that artist as a rather than a person with a person with the genius.
And I have to tell you, I think it was a big error.
I think that allows somebody, a simple person to believe to be like a reciply like the source and the source of all the mysteries of all the mysteries and ethernal responsibility, unknown.
It's like to ask somebody to ingoid the sun.
Deform and distores the ego and creates all of these ingestilies on the performance.
And I think it's been this pressure to destroyed artists in the past 500 years.
And, if this is true, and I think that, the question becomes and now?
Can we do it different?
Maybe go back to a much more understanding of human relationship between humans and creative.
Or maybe no.
Maybe we can't cut 500 years of rational thinking in a rational thinking about 18 minutes.
And you probably have people between the audience that would sudden, you know, scientific suspects of scientific notions, you follow that they follow their projects.
I'll probably not convince you all about this thing.
But the question I would like to ask is -- why not?
Why don't think about it in this way?
Because it has more sense than any other thing that has ever heard to explain the exasperant impredicability of the creative process.
A process, like anyone that has ever tried to do something -- so, basically, everybody here -- you know, it's not rational behavior.
And, in fact, it can seem completely paranormal.
I did this meeting recently with the extraordinary poet Ruth Stone, who has now 90 years old, but that has been a poet for the whole life, and he told me that during his childhood in the fields, and I was working out in the field, and I felt it in the field came from the landscape.
He told me that it was like an air.
And that was getting rolling towards from the landscape.
He heard come, because he had to do the ground below his feet.
He knees to have one thing to do to that point and it was like, to run as a morn."
And it goes up to the house and was followed by this poetry, and she wouldn't get a piece of paper, and a pretty quickly, while the past, while the transformation, and save it on the page.
Sometimes couldn't be quick enough to be enough and running and running out to get into the house and poetry the rolled rolled across and she would keep rolling through the landscape and would keep rolling through the landscape in the landscape of a poet.
And then there were those times -- this piece, I'm going to forget -- there were moments in which was almost losing, ok?
So he was running to the house and he was trying to paper, and he was trying to switch, and he was going to spoke, and he said, it was like if you had to come away with the other hands and the enffave.
And he had the poetry from the tail from the tail, and it was putting it on the page.
And in these cases, the poetry would be presented to the perfect and intact to the perfect word to the earlie.
So when you feel it -- it's crazy, it's exactly the same creative process.
Not all my creative process -- I'm not a convicture.
I am a mule, and my work to work is to work out of the same hours every day, and south and south and working and spend over the enjoy and spend it on it.
But even in my kardage, I brought against that thing, sometimes.
And I imagine a lot of you have the han.
You know, even if the job and ideas and ideas would give me a certain funny, I couldn't be honestly knowledge.
And what is this thing?
And how do we relate to it in a way that we don't have to lose your head, butter, what's going to stick do?
For as I think about it, the best example I have a Tom Waits, which I have different interviewed years ago for a day.
We were talking about this, and you know, Tom, and you know, Tom, for the majority of life has been the incarnation of the contemporary ary, trying to control, and dominate these kind of impulses.
But then instead of it, and a day, and a day while he was driving on a highway to Los Angeles, changed everything for him.
He was going to fast, and all of a healthy track that little bit of melodia, that comes into his head as it does inspiration, elusive and the want, you know, it's wonderful, you know, it's wonderful, but it doesn't know how to get it.
It doesn't have a piece of paper, it doesn't have a mar recorator.
So we start to feeling this kind of old old old old growing in him, "I'm going to lose and hossessioned by this song.
They're not good enough and I can't do it.
And instead of go to the panic stop.
He put the whole mental process and made something completely new thing.
And he just looked at the sky, and he said, "Scuse, don't you know, I'm not going to lead it?"
"You seems that can write a song?
If you really want to exist, back to a more opportunity when I can take care of you.
Striments, to adding somebody else today.
You go to the Leonard Cohen."
And his working process changed after this.
Not the work, the work was still dark like it.
But the process, and the fish that was released when the genius was released when the genius, the genius, the geniusing it realizing it was realizing it was realizing it was realizing that he didn't have to be an interior.
but well this peculiar, wonderful bizarre conversation a conversation between Tom and this strange thing that was not Tom.
So what I began to change a while I started to change the way I was working and already saved to me.
This idea, save me when I was writing "Mangia, Prega, Ama," and falls in one of those dispersing disperation where we're going to be working on something and we can't and begin to think that it's going to be a disaster book.
Not just bad the worst book.
And I started to think about designing this project.
But then I remember from Tom who talked to the air and trying to us.
So I got my face on my face in the manus, and I direct my comments to a corner of the room.
And I said high, "Yes, bot, both both both you know that if this book is not going to be brilliant not going to be brilliant, right?
Because as I can see, I'm putting all that I haven't got more about this.
So if you want it to be better, you've got to give you the side.
Okay. But if you don't know, you're not going to do anything.
I'm going to write the same because it's my work.
And I would like to do that was recorded to me that I'm presented to me to do my para" because -- the end is like that, in the end of Africa's deserts in the deserts of North Africa's deserts and sacred sacross the clear dance, and until hours and until hourselves.
And they were always magnific because the baners were professionals, and they were fantastic professions.
But every one of that really, something happened, and one of these artists became in reality.
And I know what I'm talking about.
It was like the time you stopped and the ballerine walking through a kind of lportal and was not doing anything different from the solution, like the 1,000 night before, but everything happened in the inef.
And suddenly suddenly as a human one.
But you accepty from the degree of the divinity of the divinity.
And when this happened, the people who knew what it was, people knew what it was, they were called his name.
They gave the hands and they started sing, "Oh, God God."
That's God, you know.
South Nstory -- when the Mors the south of Spain, the south of Spagna, they took this habitude with them and ready changed in the century, "Oh, Allah, that you can still feel in the hold, that you can still be in the fleashion.
In Spana, when an artist has done something impossible and magic "Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, magnant," incomprehensible, except -- a short of God.
And it's great because we need it.
But, the problem goes down, for the ballerin-stance, when you wake up and discovers that are the 11 of the Martedday and God is no longer.
It's simply a death, and maybe it will never be able to get to the higher to ask that healthize.
And maybe no one dog will be the name of God even while and what to do with the rest of his life?
It's hard.
This is one of the most painful reconciliations.
But maybe it doesn't have to be so anguying, if you can not believe, in fact, that the most extraordinary aspects of your being coming from yourself.
But believe yourself that they were given to be given by a squisite of your life that you have to get somebody else when you find.
And, you know, if we think in this way.
And so I started to think about it, and it's certainly as I thought of different months during the book, that I'm going to public book that I'm going to published, the dangerous, exactly followed by my great success.
And what I have to continue to tell me when I feel electricrized by this is, not fear.
Don't shoring. It's just your work.
He points to present yourself for your parts, whatever it can be.
If your job is ball, dance.
If the divine, assurd geniusing you decide to leave some kind of wonder, for a moment through your effort, for a moment through your effort, then "Ole!"
Altriments, you make the same dance.
And "Ole!" to yourself.
I think we have to teach it.
"Ole!" to yourself, even for the human love and test love and test talks to to do you keep in the way.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen!
As you know, I've talked about some of these projects on human genome, what can meaning and the discovery of genes.
We're starting a new pattern -- we started to digitalizing biology and now to start from that code code and now from that digital code.
We always tried to ask questions.
"What is life?" is something that a lot of biologists I believe that a lot of levels.
We tried different approaches, reducing it to the minimes.
We're digitalizing by almost 20 years.
When we sequenced the human genome was going to go from the analog world of biology to the digital world.
Let's ask us, can we regenerate the life, or create new life from this universe?
This is the map of a small organism, the Mycoplasma genome, which is the species from the smallest genome in the lab.
And we tried to reduce the genome to create a little bit smaller.
We are able to eliminate a hundred genes of the around 500 that are here.
But when we look at his metabolic map, it's relatively simple respect to us.
You know, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can elimind, one at the time, it's very imlikely that this can bring to a live.
So we decided that the only way to be to synthesizing this chromosome, so that they can modify the components for some of these fundamental questions.
And so we started the adventure of the "Can we synthesize a chromoo?"
Can chemistry to produce these big molecules that we have never been able to create before?
And, in the case we can make a chromosound?
A chromosome is simply a piece of inert materials.
The speed with which we are able to digitalizing life is growing up to exponential.
Our capacity to write the genetic code of genetic code.
And our most recent results to the exponential curve.
We started more than 15 years ago.
The process has requid a lot of past, starting with a bioetic review, before the first experiments.
But we discovered that synthesize DNA is very difficult.
There are tens of thousands of machines at the world that produce small segments of DNA, the length of 30 to 50 to feet and it's a degenerative process is longer than the segment is longer than the segment is longer.
So we had to develop a new method to assembling these fragments and correct the errors.
And this was our first attempt to start by the digital information of Phi X 174.
It's a small virus that bacteria.
We designed the errors of errors and brought a molecules of DNA molecule.
The interesting part is when we took this piece of inert material chemical material chemistry started to read this genetic code and read this genetic code and producing the virtual particles.
The virals are then released from the cell phones, they went back and destroyed the Es.
I talked about recent with members of the oil industry said that they certainly understood this model.
They have more than you.
We believe that this is a situation where software can really build its own hardware in a biological system.
But we wanted to do the best things.
We wanted to build the battery.
It's more than 580,000 letters of genetic code.
So we thought to build it in the size of viruses, so that we can change the cassets to understand what the cassets are a living cassets of a living cell.
The design is crucial, and if we start with digital information in a computer, these have to be very accurated.
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995, the fact that was a mibasic error for every 10 mibasis.
We discovered, resequencing, 30 errors. If we had used that original sequence we would never be able to do it.
One part of the process is to design segments that are subjects that are overlapping with all the other seats of 50 letters to build subunts to build subunits of smaller subunts working together.
Let's roject elements here.
You probably read that we read about the filige.
Think about it. We have a genetic code genetic code.
Three of those letters together and codifying about 20 friends, and there's a specific order, and there's a specific order.
So we can use the genetic code to write words, though.
What we've done about the beginning is self-supposed to do it.
Some of people have been deuses from the fact that it was not poetry.
We designed these segments to be able to simply themselves.
There are enzymes that repair them and put them together.
And we began to assembling of the parts, starting with five to seven thousands of the letters of 24 miles of the letters of 24 letters.
And every step we produced these segments in abundancing so that we can sequenced that we're trying to make an extremely robuster -- as you'll see in a minute.
We're trying to automatize the process.
So, this seems to be the table.
When we go to these very long, they will not grow them very long, they will not grow more directly in the E. there.
It comes to the limits of the modern tools.
So we consider other mechanisms.
We knew about another mechanism mechanism, which is in biology, which is in biology to repaid the DNA to repair segments.
Here's an example.
This organism, called Deinococcus radiodurans, it can absorb three million radiation.
You can see in the high school, as his chromosome.
In 12 -- 24 hours comes to exactly as it was before.
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do it.
These organisms.
They can live under empty.
They're absolutely certain that life exists in space, and you move to find new environments.
Actually, NASA showed that this vien.
This is a picture of the molecule that we built using these process, just using the lievidence of the segments.
The lievid them automatically.
This image was not taken with an electronic microscope, but with a regular microscope.
It's a very large molecule that we can see it with a law.
These are pictures that cover a period of about six seconds.
This is the advertising that we've done a long time ago.
It's more than 58,000 letters of genetic code.
It's the biggest molecule of a defined structure.
It has a fish molecular high schools.
If we're going to passit it with a character, they would take 142 pages to get this genetic code.
Now, how do we do it work?
Of course, to a virus is a girls.
It's a little more complicated when they use bacteria.
It's also simpler when it's the eucariot cells like our res: you can just extract the nucleus and insert the other, which is basically the process.
The archaea chromosome, the chromosome is integrated inside the cell phone, but we recently demonstrated that we're able to do a complex cromosome.
We put a cromosome cromosome.
The two are different than men.
We add a few genes in a way that we decide what to chromom to chromom for this chromoso."
And it was skilled with people in a way to kill all the proteins.
And when we put it into the cell has been wonderful -- and you appreciate our chromosome, the new chromosome, the new chromosome.
And we started thinking that we couldn't go beyond it, but we tried community in there.
This is one of the greatest mechanisms.
We discovered that many species have added a second or a third chromosomes from some hand, in a second thousands of new tracks to that species.
So who thinks about evolution like a gene to evolution like a gene of biology.
There is of enzymes called "restrial enzymes of restrial DNA.
The chromosome that was in the cell that was in the cell as well.
The cell phone.
It's expressed, and he recognized the other chromosome, as an extrue material material, and we found with only the cell and the new chromooe.
It has become blue to the genes that we put it.
And in a short of time, all the characteristics of a species are going to lost and it transformed the whole new species, based on the new software that we put in the cell phone.
All the proteins are changed, the membranes are changed, and when we read the genetic code.
Now, this could look at genetic alchemy altering the software DNA we can change the stuff.
Now, I've already explained that this is not about gene -- but of progress from three and a half evolution, and I said that maybe we're going to create a new version of the Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosion of the Cambrian explosion process.
Why do that?
I think it's pretty obvious when we think about our needs.
We're about to spend six billion and a half billion in the next 40 years.
Just to give an example: I was born in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for each existing in 1946, there are going to be four.
We are having a problems right now to find food, water and clean and clean and gass for six billion and a half-half billion and a half.
It's going to do it for nine billion.
We are more than five billion carbon billion carbon than 30 billion bards.
That means a day.
When we try to find biological process, or whatever kind of process to replace them, it's going to be a huge challenge.
We have to keep in all of the CO2 emission of these materials that end up in the atmosphere.
At the day of today, thanks to scientific discovery that all over the world, we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I like to think that are designed for the future.
The electronic industry has only a dozen dozen of components, and think about how many different things.
Our limits here are data by biologic reality and our imagination.
We now have the techniques, thanks to these synthesization, able to create what we call the combined genomics.
We are able to build a big robot that can produce a million chromosomes a million chromosomes.
Think about processing these 20 million different genes or to try to optimize the processes to get optimizing or drugs, new vaccines, we can change, through a small team, and create biology that in the last 20 years of science.
And it's simply a standard.
We can choose for possibilities.
This is a few software of some software programmed on which we're working to be able to sit and design species.
Well, we don't know necessarily as they we.
We know exactly how their genetic code.
We're focusing on the four-generation.
You have seen that you can extract ethanol from the free was a finished experiment.
We've got a second and third generation that will use enough soon pretty soon as the higher than the higher.
But the only way that biology can have a great impact without increasing the cost of food and limited the cost of food and limiting the CO2 in the prim, which we're working to design cell to design cells that we are working to design, and we think we could reach this discocover, and we think we could reach this discover, and we think we could have the prime carbon of fourth generation in about 18 months.
The sunlight combined with CO2 is a methodom -- but in our discoveries all over the world, we found different methods.
This is a organism that we described in 1996.
He lives in the deep ocean deep, about 2,500 feet of the water.
It creates the CO2 use hydrogen molecular as the source of energy.
We're trying to understand whether we can get CO2, which can easily be transported to be transported transportation, convert that CO2 in carbant, to drive this process.
So the short we think we could be able to increase what the basic question, "What the basic life" is Now, truth -- we have the objective objective the oil industry.
Exactly. If you can't do it from TED, where can you do?
It would become a source of energy.
Also, we're working to use the same methods to create vaccines.
You have seen this year with influence, we are always background of a year and a dollar in less when you treat the right time.
I think that this is changing building vaccinable to change combinable in an ance.
Here's how the future could begin to be changing, now, the tree of evolution, acceling evolution, accelerating the evolution with synthetic bacteria.
We are so much to improve people.
Our purpose is to live long enough to try to do it. Thank you very much.
First of all I'm going to show you, the most possible, a fundamental job that we took to Microsoft to Microsoft in the followed to a year ago exactly. This is Seadragon.
It's a environment, where you can interact is the local levels that remote with a huge amount of visual data --
We are seeing lots of gabytars of digital pictures of digital fooling and keeping the pictures as we want.
And it doesn't matter how great information is the amount of information that we're seeing data or images.
Most of them are digital photographs, but this for example is a commodent from Bilibrary from the Bilibrary of Congress, and it comes into the gam.
It doesn't do any difference because the only thing that the prestations of a system like this is the number of pixel on your screen in any moment. It's also a very flexible.
This is a whole book, example of data not images.
This is the Dickens. Every Casa desolated represents a capitly.
To show you that it's a text of text and not images, we can do something about the realal representation of the real representation of the text -- not a picture.
It could be a little artificial way to read an electronic book.
You don't consider.
This is a more realistic example of the Guardian.
Every image is the beginning of a section.
And it gives you the pleasure and the beautiful experience to read the version of a quotidia, which is for nature or a quotidia, which is for nature a lot of half.
We also did something with the corner of this particular Guardian.
We created a high-resolution, high resolution -- much higher than what is using in a normal publish.
If you want to see the characteristics, you can see here.
Or other models, or even the specific specifics.
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on the screen.
We hope that this means to put pop-up to the pop and other similar to be necessarily to be necessary.
Of course, the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology.
And I don't want to lose time, if not to say that we have contributes to give in this field.
These are all the streets in the U.S. obpaatial image of NASA.
So now we go to something else.
This is effectively from living on the web; you can go to it.
This is a project called Photosynth, which combine two different technologies.
One is Seadragon and the other is a research of a very interesting research, a student of the University of Washington, with the aid of Steve Seitz of Washington, with Seitz of Microsoft Resear. Seitz of Microsoft Research.
And it's from Seadragon.
You can see it when we do this kind of screen, where we can move from another and have this kind of experience to the other kind of experience to multiple resolution.
But the space of the pictures is actually a meaning.
Big algorithms of visualizing these pictures together, so that correspond to the real places where the real imagine -- all these things are close to the Grashes in the Grashs of Roccils in the Grashs of a slides of a slides, and these things are all colleague, and these things are all college college, and these things are all collected to space.
I don't know if I have time to show you some other environment.
There are some much more space.
I want to go directly to one of the original data set of Noah-- and this comes from a previous prototynth that we have done working for the first time -- to show you what I'm going to do for the first time -- to show you what's really the key is really the key of Photosynth. And it's not necessarily very evidence that we put in the website.
We had to worry about legal aspects and so on.
This is a reconstruction of Notre Dame images taken from Flickr. Basta digiting Dame in Flickr and you get images of types in Flickr and you get images of the field, other of the field pus and viewing a pictures that has discovering a model.
So they're all pictures from Flickr and they were all connected to this way.
And it's possible to navigate in this simple.
You know, I would never think about to work for Microsoft.
It's very gratify to get this kind of high.
I think you can see that it's a lot of different types of different types of phones to the professional cell phones SLR, a significant, a significant number of significant, put together in this environment.
And if you can try to get those strange strange.
A lot of them are down, etc.
Somepart here is a series of photographs and -- there.
This is a poster of Notre Dame correctly.
We can go from the posters to the physics of this environment.
The essential point is that we can do with the social environment. This is now taking data from the entire memory of how it appears the Earth, from the visual point of view -- and connects all those data together.
All of those pictures become together, more than the sum of the parts.
You have a model of the whole model that emerge.
Think of this as Stephen Lawlk of Stephen Lawler on Earth.
It's something that grows in complexity as well as people us, and the advantages for those who are using the us.
Their pictures are marched by other people.
If somebody gets the idea of conturing all of these kinds of numbers saying the name of Notre Dame improvises of all of those data, and I can use it as the engine, and I can use as an ingres' point, and I can use the engine, in that universe, in that universes of anybody else, and have an social experience.
Of course, a consequence of this is virtual virtual models of any interesting part of the Earth, and crockets and satellitarian and satellitarian and satellitaries, but by the memory of collective.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I understood good? What your software will have to do is that at some point, in the next few years in the next years, all the photographs and shared by anybody in the whole world will be basically connected together?
BA: Yeah. What's going to do is basically discovering.
He's creating hyperlink, if you want to hyperly.
And he's doing him at the bottom of images.
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the wealthy of information that a lot of these images.
As when you do a research of images on the Web, you tell a sentence, and the head has a lot of information about the pictures.
Now, what if that picture is connected to all your pictures?
So the amount of interconnection, and the amount of wealthy that is really enormous classic effect of the network.
CA: Blaise, it's really incredible. Compliments.
BA: Thank you very much.
One of the main pleasures and one of the research of the research of the research of people who didn't forget to live in the wind of the ancient in the wind, you touched the pasts in the wind of the ragiving plants.
You think that Jaguarl Jaguarl is traveling still beyond the Milky Way, or that the ancient myths are still significant, or that in Himalaya, the budden of the Dharma, to remember, to remember, to remember the central importance of the world that we live not existed in the sense of the world that we don't exist, but it's just a model of reality,
the consequence of a particular choices that our stirps that our stirps has done --
And, of course, we all share the essential tracts.
Let's go to it.
We are subjects to the beginning.
We have to deal the inexorse of death, so we don't surprised and dallowing us and whale --
we have an art.
What it is the particular is particular, the rhythm of every culture.
It doesn't matter that they are the Borneo, or the Borneo, or follows of Haiti, or the Worriers of the Kenya desert in Kenya sector, the Curban Sahara.
He was my journey of journey in desert a month ago, or a month ago, or an yak in the valley, on the Everest, the mother of the world.
All of these populations that there are other ways of thinking, there are other ways of thinking, other ways of thinking, other ways of moving in the world.
And, if you reflect a moment, it's a concept that can give you hope.
You see, the matter of cultures of the world create a spiritual life and cultural life, and cultural to the planet and it's important for the well-being of the planet and it's important for the planet as biosphere.
And you can think about this rather cultural as an ethnose and you can define the ethnose. And you can define the sum of all the concepts, dreams, myth, dreams ideas, inspirations, intuition from humanity of consciousness.
The ethnosphere is the wonderful patrimonium of humanity.
It's the symbol of what we are and what we can be in as a species of what we can be.
And because the biosphere has been gravely consumed as well as well as much rapidly.
No biologist, for example, would say 50 percent of all the species has been or on the beautimic extinct because it's false -- in the most apocality, in the most of the biologic diversity -- and you don't even near the most optimistic diversity.
The indication of this is, of course, the loss of language.
When you've been born languages on this planet.
One language is not just by a vocabulary or from a series of rules.
One language is the shoulder of human spirit spirit --
It's the middle of every culture comes into the material.
Each language is a forest of mind, a wind, a thinking ecosystem of spiritual system.
And of those 6,000 languages, while we're sitting here in Monterey, at least half the hours of the children.
They are no longer teached to the children, which means it doesn't change something, which is already dead.
What is more than being sad than being volved by silence, to be the last to speak a language, not to transmit the wisdom of the children?
And this is the state of somebody in some part of the world every two weeks of the world every two weeks of a ancian antie and leads it to the last sillabe of a ancient language.
And I know that somebody is going to tell "Is that is not better?
The world would not be a better place if we all talk about the same language language?" OK, then we talk yoruba.
Let's talk about.
You've got a tract what it means you can't talk about your language.
I would like to do a journey to do a journey across the age --
a tiny journey of what we're going to lose.
Many of us forget that when I say, "different different different ways of exists.
Let's take for example, this birth Barasan Amazony of the anacony, which creates to the military of the anaconda, which creates to the military bread.
It's a population of a population that is not able to distinguished the blue color, because the celests is identified in the forest, which is identified in the forest of the popular.
They have a strange language and a regular rule, called language, called the language.
Everything has radicated in the past, the particularity is that in these families that are talking about six or seven languages talking about six or seven languages.
They are listening to and then start talking about.
Let's take one of the most interesting tribes with which I lived there, the Waoran Ecuador who had the first contacts in 1958.
In 1957, five missionaries have tried a contact error.
They've done by photographs that they would return them in pose that they had friends, forget that this population of the plug forest had never seen anything in the size.
They've collected pictures on the research of a shape or a figury, not finding anything, they had concludes that was the diavole, and killed killed the five with the lances.
But the Waorans didn't kill the strangers.
They kill with each other.
Five percent of the mortality was caused by themselves.
We're answered to eight generations, and we found two natural cases and when we insisted for knowledged that one of them was insisted that they died that they died the same. And then they killed him.
The hunters were able to recognize the animal from 40 steps and recognize the species.
In the early 1980s, I was assigned a very interesting task when my Harvard professors asked me if I wanted to go to Haiti to intrupholarms to the base of Duvalier and TontMacoutes and Tonton Macoutes, and impossessing me to do the zombies.
To give a sense to the miracle, I should understand the Vodoun culture.
It's quite of a complex metaphysics of the world.
Very interesting.
If I ask you to tell me the big religions of the world, what would you say?
Cristian Islam, Buddhistory, Buddy, etc.
A continent is always left out, thinking that sub-Saharan Africa-Saharan Africa, and the Voodoo, and the Voodoo, and the Voodoo is not that the distilled of these religious concepts during the tragics of the slavery.
What makes interesting is the intense is the intense of life and dead.
So you live the spirits.
You know, the spirits can be invocated by the Great Aqua, they answer to the dance of the dancy and replacing temporary to the soul of the way that for a short of the following becomes the dio.
So the voodoodoodoodor to say, "You want to talk about God.
We do it in the temple, and we become God."
And from the moment, is the spirit that you drive, is the spirit that you driver, how can you do male?
So you see this incredible events to these incredible events of trance events that touching activity that touches touch of the mind of the mind when it's catalyzed in a state of exciting.
And all the popules with whom I lived in the most extraordinary Kogi of Sierra Nevada de Santa Mara Colombia.
The ancient of the ancient civilization that once they live on the floors of Colombia, the population of Colombia, the population was going to be about the massive volcanic floor.
In a blood of blood blood, this popular has never been conquered by shouldn't have been conquered.
At today they have governed by a clerd, but their formation is decided.
The young people followed from the families to three or four years and they live secret in a good world of good and shadows in the basis for 18.
Two of nine years of choices to reproduce the nine months of gestation that spent the mother, are metaphory of the mother, they are metaphory of Great Mad.
For all this time, they get acculate to the values of their societies that predict that their prayers and only their praying the cosmic balance -- or to say the cosmic balance -- or to say the balance.
And in terms of this incredible initiation, they are suddenly carried out and for the first time in life, at the age of 18, they see an alb. And in that active awareness of the beautiful of the sun of the beauty of the beauty of the beauty of the beautiful, everything that has learned in the enough of its beautiful.
"Right?
It's wondering. Now it's going to protect it."
They call the biggest brothers and say that you, brothers, are the brothers of the world.
This intuition is extremely important.
When we think about indigenous populations and the environment, and the old environment, and the old story of the wild history, which is a razy concept in its simplicity or maybe some people are closer to the Earth, and we say these popules are closer to the Earth of us.
The indigenes are not feeling feelings or indebuled by our algies.
There is no space, for these things in the Asmat or winds of the Asmat wind of the Tibet, but because of the time and they created a mystick of the Earth is based on the concept of it, but on an intuition: the concept that the Earth's concept that the Earth: the concept that the Earth can live because it infuses from human consciousness --
What does it mean?
It means that a kid of the Ans that growing growing that the mountain is a spirit Apu that is going to be a deeply human being deeply and will have a very different relationship with the mountain or that place with the mountain or the Montana that place of Montana male of Montana bag of rockets.
which is the dimore of a spirit or a mineral mineral is irrelevant.
What is interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between individual and the natural world.
I grew up in the forests of Columbia belief that the forests service to be cute.
And it made me a different human friends from my friends Kwakiut, who believe the Hukukukuk and the history of the paradisease, and the history of the paradisease, spirits that live at the end of the world, spirits that live in the world.
If you start to consider that these cultures can create different, you can start understanding some of them.
I took this pictures in the normal Amazon.
Maybe some of you have heard about ayahuasca, the most powerful psycho-repertorial of the repertorial repertor of sciamanic repertorie.
What makes it fascinating the ayahuask is not the macological potential of sustance, but his elaboration. It's composed by two elements.
On the side, this lian liance that has a series of beta-carb, harmine and harbly harmine and hardly hallucine, slightly hall.
Taking the only plants is a bluepractice that alters a little bit, but it's mixed with the leaves of the family of the coffee of the family of the coffee of the coffee of the coffee.
This is a trip of triptamine, very similar to the servotonina, dimetho-five methox-five methoydimethox.
If you ever see the Yanomami to you can get to the nose the sustance that they do from a different set of species, there is a different set of species.
To be that polar on for the nose is a little bit like being disappeared by a clear pinds, books and landscape on a sea of electricity. It doesn't creates a distortion of reality.
I had often was often with my professor, Richard Evan Shultes, the man who had been psychedelic, with his discovery of hallucins in the 1930s in the 1930s in Mexico.
Second my tanks can classify these trips like hallucinogens like halluciny, because if you can't tell anybody where.
It's possible to assumption, only if they assumptions with other chemices that denied MAO.
Now it's the beauti: the beautiful coins that are in this lian inhibitors of MAO, the same kind of necessarily to potentiate trial to potentiate trial question. The question of 80,000 species of plants, like these popular popules to find two morphologistly not biochemiochemistry that is such a biochemiochemiochemistry that is subject?
We use the great euphemism and the error, which can be revealed to be revealed with it.
But if we ask to Indians, they will tell us.
What does it mean?
This tribe, Cofan, has 17 varieties of ayhuasca, who distinguished in the forest, and that to our eyes would come into the same species.
If we ask them how they stabilish their taxonomy will tell us how they would say, "I think, I won't know?"
The solution is: they take the 17 varieties in a night of lense and each dog with a different tun.
With there is no more interesting than Harvard, but it's much more interesting than counting stames.
Now, the problem is that the problem is that the ones of us who have heart the indigenous popular popular -- but in some way to the sea history of the history of the world reals, and spends up.
In fact, the 20th century, between 300 years, it will not be remembered for the wars or innovations, but rather like it was in where we are stopped and abbrushed and we have hopped in the destruction of biological diversity and cultural diversity and cultural diversity and cultural diversity and cultural diversity is not change.
All cultures through the century have been involved in a dance of life.
And the problem is not technology.
The Sioux Indians have not stopped to be Sioux when they put part of Americans are not stopped to be when they put part of Americans.
It's not the change or the technology that threat the integrity of ethnos. It's the power.
The flight of domination.
And if you look at the world, you discovered that these are not destined cultures to disappear.
They're living creatures and dynamics outside from existence to the existence that will beyond their abilities.
What you can do is a patrit of Penans --
a popular notes of Sarawak, in south Asia, a popular population that lived in the forests to a generation, and now reduce to the service and the prostitution of the river, where you can see the river, where you can see the river, where you can see the river, where you can see the half behours to the Enavail, where the navails the orizont's orizonte, where the ship,
ready to filling the stives with the woodom in the forest.
Or in the case of the Yanomers, are the diseases that are coming with the hor.
If we move on the mountains of Tibet, where I'm doing a lot of research, you'll see the during of political domination.
As you know the genocide, the physical physics of a people, is convicted to universal level, but the ethnocide of a population, the destruction of a population, not just convicted in certain the environment, because it makes part of development.
And you can't understand the suffering of Tibet until you start in the beginning.
I spent the 6,000 miles from China, in the Western China, coming up through the Tibet to Lhasa with a young year, but only came to the statistics in Lhase, but only came back to the statistics.
6,000 world's sacred world's sacred sacross and energy.
1.2 million people killed from military Revolution.
The father of this guy has been achieved to Panchen Lama.
Which means that has been killed to the Chinese invasion.
On the uncle is in Santity in Santity during the diaspore who brought the people in Nepal.
Her mother has been imprisoned and his colda had to be richole.
It has been brought to carry at the age of two years, hidden years, because he couldn't live without of hids.
The sister, who did the same, was put in the field of reeducation.
One day has involved a calculation fashion, for this transgression, has been able to work for seven years.
The Tbet of Tibet can be unable, but the spirit of the population of the population is to keep present.
At the end, everything comes to a choice.
Do we want to live in the world, or we want to get the policyromatic world.
The great anthropologist Mead, before they die said that his greatest that his greatest fear was that in our world, just will not just see the whole range of human imagination, not only will see the whole range of human imagination, but a day we can see us from a sleep, but a day we will see it from a sleep.
And it's humit to remember that our species is for 600,000 years.
The Revolution, which has given us the agriculture, which has done uses us to replace to the cult of seeds, replacing the poetry of the class, creating the gerarchy of the specialization, and we're talking about 10,000 years ago.
The modern industrialized world has 300 years.
This is not suggests that we have the answers that we have the answers to all the challenges that we have to address to the millen.
When these myself cultures of the world is asked what it wants to be humans, respond with 10,000 different voices.
And it's in these answers that we all realized the possibilities of being what we are.
I took this photograph of the northern island, when I went to the whales I went to the whales with Inuit, and this man, Olaya, he told me the wonderful story of his grandfather.
The Canadian government has not always gentled with the Inuit and in the '50s to stabilide them in colonies.
The grandfather of this man refused to go to it.
The family, themselves for his life, he brought to all the arms, and all his attres.
You have to know that Inuit is not cold the cold, you know.
The slands of the slands were made of fish skin the skin skin the skin of the slevels.
The grandmother of this guy is not intimize from the night of artics or the blizartics that suffering.
It's spoken view, hot the skins of skins and defected in their hand. When the fected focused on their hand.
It has salived on the top of this cacross this caccine and when she came solid, has killed a dog.
He has taken the dog and created a brille, with the tower cassets has created a slightly sled to another dog dog and it's disappeared on the banks, and it's disappeared on the banks.
Do we want to talk to you to nothing?
In the opened 199999 the government California, the total control of a territory of the largest California and Texas the California and Texas together.
It's their new patria. It's called Nunavut.
It's a territory of independent resources.
One beautiful example of how a country can reconciliar with his people.
And, finally, I think it's pretty obvious at least to the people who have been in these remote areas of the planet, realized that they're not remoted.
For somebody is home.
They represent sections of the human imagination that leads up to the high of us all these kids, like the dreams of our kids, become part of our children, become part of the new geography of the hope.
Finally, National Geographic is convinced that politicians will never get anything.
We believe that polemies --
[Applausive, they are not persuasive, but we believe that stories can change the world, and maybe we're the best institution to tell the stories of the world. Every month in the countrysit has 35 million visites.
156 countries transmit our television.
Our magazines are letter from millions of people.
Our work is to traveling our audiences to bring our audiences in places of cultural wonderful cultural amount of lifestyle -- hope, hopefully will be able to revevealing of the anthropologistls of anthropologistyle of life in a place in a place in a world world in a plualist, and we have to find a style world.
in which the wisdom of all the popules can contribute to our well-being collective.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some of the things that I wrote in this book that I hope I hope I hope you already heard and evidence that you have heard of them in the case.
I want to start with what I call "the dogma dog,
The official dogma dog,
The dogm official of all the Western industrial societies. The dogmaster: "If we want to massive the well-being of our citizen." The way to do it is to massive libert."
The reason in the fact that the freedom is in the fact that the freedom is precious, essential essential to human beings.
On the other is in the fact that if we are free, each of us can act to do everything that massive our well-being, without no one that decide in name.
The way to massive liberty is to massive freedom choice.
More choices people have, the more is liber, and greater is their freedom, is their well-being.
This is so profoundly radicated in society that no one dream of the society that nobody would be dreamed to put it into the doube.
And it's also deeply radicated in our lives.
I'm going to show you some examples of what the progress.
This is my supermarket. It's not particularly great.
I allowed a simple named about conditions.
In my supermarket are 175 conments, without contaring 10 varieties of olive oil and 12-a-a-balsamic across the balsm that you can buy to get a huge number of condments in the circumstancy that no one of 15 already already is your gradiment.
This is the supermarket.
And then you go to the electronic store, to buy a stere: cassroom lector readers CD, radio paper.
And in this individual electronic store, there's a great number of audio components.
We can realize six and a half million different combinations using the components that there are in a store.
You have to admit that there's a lot of choice.
Other -- the world of communications.
Sometimes when I was a child, you could get all the services, you could get all the services that were proviited by the mom Bell.
He had the phone; you didn't buy it.
A consequence of this, between the other, was that the telephone is that the telephone doesn't break.
This is gone.
So now we have a variety of telephone variety of telephone, especially between the cell phones.
Here's the cell phones of the future.
My favorite is the middle in the middle of the hiels of the hidden for cras.
If you don't have seen that you haven't seen it in your house, you're beyond it will pretty soon
And what eventually happens is that people in the stores and does this question. And you know what the answer? The answer is "No."
It's not possible to buy a cell phone.
So, in other aspects of life that are much more important than waters, is the same explosion of choices.
It doesn't happen healthcare in the United States that you go from doctor and the doctor of what you have to do.
Instead, to the doctor, and the doctor says, "Okay, could we do A, or B." "As it has these benefit and these risks and these risks. What do you want to do?"
You say, "Dr, what should I do?"
And the doctor says, "It has these benefit and these risks, and Bs have these risk."
"What do you want to do?"
And you know, "Doctor if she was what to doing?"
And the doctor: "But I'm not here."
We call it "the autonomy of the autonomy, expression that makes it seems a nice thing.
But in fact, it's not that a moving the weight and the responsibility of taking decisions from somebody who knows someone who knows nothing that doesn't know -- and therefore, almost certainly is not the ideal condition to take the patient.
There is a huge marketing of pharmaceutics, direct to people like me and you, that if you think has no sense that we can't buy them.
But if we can't buy them, why do we advertis?
The answer is that they want to door we call the doctor to ask them to change the recip.
Something about how our identity is our identity is an issue of choice, as you see in this just, "We don't want to force the children. They're not going to force their sex to the right moment.
And we can reinvent how many times.
Which means that every morning, you have to decide -- you have to decide that kind of person wants to be.
Resides to the family and the marriage, a long time perspective of anyone where, it was that you had married the most pretty soon as possible as possible.
The only real choice was with a choice, not here, and not even what to do later.
Today, everything is really to play.
I mean, very smart students, and I think about 20 percent in less than a time.
And because they are not brilliant, because they're not less diligent.
But why are they impensive, I mean to ask you, "I should get marmarry or now? I should do it now?"
"Would I get marries? I have to think about before the children or careers?"
They're interrogative.
And they try to answer these questions, even if this implement not completing the compites and not get a good vote to my exam.
And they have to do it. They're very important.
Now, the work, we are lucky, like Carl art, because technology allows us to work every day, from every day, from every day, from every day, from every day, from the Hotel Randolph.
You know, there's a corner, and I'm not going to tell anybody where, where WiFi Fi works.
You don't say, why I want to use it.
What does it mean, this incredible freedom of choice that we have about the working? Is that we have to decide, if we have to work or not.
We can go to the ball, with the cell with the cell phone in a tas, the Blackberry in the other, and the news, the knews, and the eye.
And even though they're all speech, every minute that we see our boy, we are also asking, "I have to answer to this call?"
"I have to answer this emails? I have to get this letter?"
And even when the answer is "no," all this makes the experience of your child very different from what would be in other conditions.
So, from whatever part of it, things, small and large objects and big, life is a question of choices.
Once the world was this: Oh, there were some possibilities, but it wasn't a question of choice.
And the world today is like this: "Is it a positive, "Is it a positive, or negatives?"
The answer is Shim.
The basic sides we know about the negative negatives.
All this choice is two negative effects about people.
The first one, paradox is that it produces paralysis instead.
With a lot of options that you choose to do it.
I'm going to give you an example meaning: a study conduct on plans.
One of my colleagues had access to the data of the Vank societies with about a million client, with about a million client clients in 2,000 different companies.
What she discovered has discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are offered in the more, the percent.
With 50 sources there is 10 percent of less adesions than they are available. Why?
Because with 50 sources between which you choose is malezed to decide, and the choice is remained to questions.
And to ask questions, and asking questions, and of course questions, and of course questions, and of course is not going to be there.
You know, you see that it doesn't mean that these workers will be able to have food, because they're not going to have enough money enough to say that decision is so ostic that decision is so ostic that they loss of work.
They don't participating it, they're losing to 50,000 dollars per year from work, which would be well willing to take them.
So the parality is a consequence of having choices.
And I think it makes the world like this.
"And finally, for the eternity: ketchup, or maione?"
You would like to just take the right decision, if it's for ethness, right?
You don't want to choose the wrong wrong and neps the wrong.
So this is the first effect. The second is that even though we can avoid the paralysis and make a choice, we are going to get the result of how we're going to be been with less options of how we're going to avails.
And this for different reasons.
One of them is that with a lot of condition of which is not perfect and it's not perfect and it's not perfectly imagine you could have a different choice. And what happens is that the alternative that would be better. And what happens is that the alternative induces of choice, and the drivers of choice,
even when it was a very good decision.
More choice, the more choices than whatever detail of whatever detail, which is insumption of choice.
Also, there is what economists call cost-opportunities.
Dan Gilbert deal very well stamp as the value that we are depends depends on what we compared in.
Of course, when there are a lot of options, it's easy to represent the alternative of the alternative options of the option that you have choice.
Here's an example. I use with all the ones that are not New York.
But it's what you probably thinking.
There's this pairy to Hamptons.
A place of light.
It's all about splendida. It's all about them.
It doesn't eat. But what he thinks is, "Well, maldities, it's Augosto."
"All my neighbors in Manhattan are alia."
"I could talk to your house."
And past two weeks away from the idea that it's losing -- every day -- the chance of parking -- the possibility of parking where you want.
The expensive opportunity decreases for what we have, even when the choice has been excellent.
And the most are the options that we have to consider the characteristics are going to be returned against how expensive expensive.
Here's another example.
This is a lot of things.
It's about living the moment, and maybe live to live slow.
But the most important point is that whatever you choice is you choices of not to do others.
The things that we don't choose have a lot of attractive that can make less attention what we do.
Tero point: half-growing expectations.
I tried on my skin buy a new jeans.
I think about almost always jeans.
Once the jeans were just a type, they were supposed to buy them and clothed from the best, they were comfortable to get them and worked a lot and worked a lot of times, began to go well.
So I went to buy a couple of a new jeans, and I said, "I need a couple of jeans, this is my cutting cute."
She said, "Can you want to slim fittold me "Slim phone?"
What do you want to do you to the buttoni? "The Stonewashed" or ""Is it?
"Do you wants?"
"I eight them wants to the large or strety? Big -- Continy was elenses.
And I was find, and after a while I managed to say, "I want the guy -- that was the only guy -- that was the only typo." He had no idea that I was so for all the diseases of jeans, and then I came out of jeans, and the best jeans, and the best jeans that I had going.
It was the mas. With all that choice had the best.
But I felt worst about it.
Why? I wrote a book to understand it.
And the reason I was worst is that with all that choice was that with all of my aspectations had to be perfected.
And I had expect-minimes. I didn't expect anything that exceptional exception, but when you have 100 different type, at least a type would be perfect.
What I had water was good, but not perfect.
After compared to what I was choice with what I was trying to insuit in compared to expectations.
The add of options in the life of people does not increasing the expectations that these have respect to the excellent of the options.
And that will produce less soddisfation, even when the results are good.
No one in marketing the world of marketing them.
Because if you know it, you won't know what I'm talking about.
The truth is more like this.
"You were better when he was worst when he was wors."
Today, in the world where we live -- opultims, industrialized citizens with expectancy -- the maximum that we can hope is that things are to waits.
You're never surprised because your expectations, my expectations, my expectations.
The secret of happiness -- what you are here -- is "Baspeace," "Yeah, you."
I mean, small moment.
I could not have to do better, I didn't accounted.
But you don't always have a bad thing.
And finally, a consequence to buy a couple of jeans when there is only that jeans is that when you're not such a jeans is that when you're not going to ask you, "Why?"
Who's responsible?" "The answer is clear.
The world is the responsible. What could I do?
When there are hundreds of jeans, and you buy a satisfacing insods, and you ask you who is the responsible responsible that the responsible, you have your responsible responsible.
You could do it better.
With hundreds of varieties.
So when people take decisions, even though the result is the result of the result and give the satisface and dams the same.
In the last few years the depression is exploded in the industrialized world.
I think a significant factor -- not the unique, but important -- of this depression of depression is that people have depression experiences because the standards are too high.
And when they have to explain this situation think that the cool.
So the final result is that in general we're better, objectively, but we feel worse.
Let me remind.
This is the official dog, what we all take for good and it's completely false. It's not true.
There is no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than you haven't shouldn't have a lot better choice is better than a little bit.
There is a critical value. I don't know what it is.
But they're sure that we have supered by a piece of the levels where the best choices are going to improve our life.
Now, from the political point -- I have almost finished from the point of view, the follow.
What it allows all this choice in the industrial society is the material.
There are a lot of places in the world, and you know about it, where the problem is not that they have too choice.
The problem is that they have too poet.
So the fact that I'm talking about is a basive to the modern of modern modern societies.
And what's depressing and arrabing is this: Steve Levitt's talked about yesterday than those expensive, and uncomfortable seats are inuseful. It's a waste of money.
I mean that these choices, complicated and independable.
They're a deleters.
They make it worse.
If a little bit of what in our societies allows a lot of choice was reversed in those where people have too pools have too poor, it wouldn't be better.
This is what economists call a paretian.
A redistributing redistribution, not just to the poor -- not just to the poor -- because of this choice that comes back.
To conclude, you can become everything that you want to be --
You know, people of culture, you think, "What does that weight?"
"It's obvious that you cannot do anything in a glass of vetro."
"At imagination, a limited view of the world --
and I payed it like this, at the beginning.
But then, I think, I realized, I realized that fish the long.
Because the reality of the facts is that if you keep in franks, so that "everything is possible" is not the freedom. You get the parals.
If you break the mouth in a way that you can become the satisfaction.
You take the paralysis, and you reduce the well-being.
Everybody needs a sphere.
This is almost certainly too strong, perhaps even for us.
But the absence of some symbolic symbolic symbolic symbolic symbolicity.
Thank you very much.
