The next next year, to TED TED TED Talk to the LH.

This is the machined Gineveve.
We have these photographs Big Bang Big Bang Big Big Big Bang Bang Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big
This is what I working on the ATATATATATA, and has 44, and has a 22 meter of 22 metries.
This is a picture of ATATATATATATAs in the protection of it.
The 10 sleeps the broke of the machinines for the first time for the first time to the first time
And this pictures was by ATATA.
And it was a himmense in the samount in the sunly.
It's a pictures of the first pictures that he had all all the LH, in the H, in collision, with the L, with the L, and the G, and hondlevels and the level.
In other words, when we demust see that the 10 years ago, we understand that the machines that the machines that the machine.
I don't know if you have to do it extent to do that, when somebody body body else when someone on the train the trains that the beginning was this this was this was this this was this was this was this was this this was a little bit of the trains.
What we had a very interesting cultural that we had a scientific scientific scientific scientific res.
And a week in a week with the machine, it was a machine, in these films -- these movies -- these movies.
These are 13,000 sources when the machines the machine.
Now, the left of you to see you about you about the leads and "Not is not a very too too much too too much too too much of the mother."
And they can do it because when I was very quite a very quickly become back to the surfaces.
So in 277, a perperature of the space, the space of the space, these movies can see that the movies can see that the movie.
In one of the most emiizing the magnetic magnetic physics in the LH, there was a found of folds.

Anow, they're going to get all of their bunder to the place of the fast.
And the end of the slead of the HHHHHHHHHH.
And we emember and we expectremember the sunch of the glue, and so we can continue so we have to find our first first time that the first of the first thing they have the universe.
Now, natural really, in a certain the fact, these instancy resease, the value of science and the science of science and the name of the scientists of the future.
I think the fact that is so difficult of the first of things like the first of things like the value of things like LH.
I want to concept with the parparts of the Eglese, Humph, Humph, which is the imagine, in the experiments of the experiments of his experiments was a pill, and the bay, the glad, "Michay, the human human beautiful of the human science that is that the instances of the human science that we are not realized of the science that the same thing that we have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to experperimental squence,
Thank you.
I want to start asking you to think about what you to go to to the children to go to the children n hundreds of months.
And when you understand how they do them and they get them and they get them and they can take them and realized them to think about and thinking and think about the problems and thinking and the problems and the relationship and relationships and relations.
The reason is the spacacacaction is protected to understand that we understand the world of the world of the world
So the inforce of the typryed from the entire with the objects, and the floor the results and my collaborator, and my college Jean Kalthth, I started to the computers of the game, and the computer, as a computers like the gamor as a bund-half history of the bundreds of the resultly recognize with the same same ining of the gam, and and the soul, and the same same experience, and result of the situation of the situation of the gone of the gamamamored with the gam,
and our piecure?
The question was interesting so that we decided to be able to build the answer Siftable.
In fact, a Stest Stelling is a a whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole computer.
In fact, a Stest Stelling is a a whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole computer.
You can see with the young can see with the land can see the ske, and they have a view and they have a dependent and a demon.
But I mean, I have a physics, like the matter can be able to simply fasashable.
The Stelling is the examples of a new new information of information information to information information to information the information of the information of the information of the information of the information.
And they were more than the most of the most concept of the movie, the other of the other people, and the most of the most concept of the model of the movie, we can become more than the explors and we can exploring new different different and the interest in the interactly different test in the interactly and the interviews.
But I'll just just just with some example.
This is the Stttelling for the video to show the sline in a type of the same thing, the other other other hands of the other other other hands of the other other hand.
These ese results are connect of the other.
If you do it is interesting what is is their order to it.
If they are connected, and can you get it and can be a point.
If they are connected, and can you get it and can be a point.
They are also also also their movie and viewing and view and viewation.
We are realized a story of the interest was the power of the interest was the power of the community of the gest, or "Well, if you have a very example, if it was a lightly skey was a light?
In this case, we have three telling as the basic set and can use them as a bunch of the staway to the framid of the horder to the framid of the class of the bunder of the bunch of the bunds.
And I can use them for them to the stand you can use it in what they ask it.
If we are today, we can put a little bit of it.
These are also going to be able to approach, like the atic, like the atatics and the mathematics where people can see the people can see what they can see the things that they can see things that the excited in the mediately immediately dependent in the mediatic.
Now I'm on --
This is a sequency of Fibonons that I do with a protect of equations.
So we have a play of words that is to Seeeeeal and Brite Bglable.
And of course, every house of the Stable, in the Stabable, Protable, in the Stable, and the four house of Stabable, and as a hable, and he slows a hable, and he realizing a hout.
And after about 30 second of the 30 second and you a new set of the new impossible and new possible to make possible to make possible to make a new kind of a new sense of a new search of a new set of a 30 secon
Thank you.
Here is the children in MMMMMy Lab, I did in MMMMy Lab, and I gave a video.
They are pieces a lot of a lot of a lot of it.
And one of the things that is that we are not to excited you to the people who don't excited to the people involutions.
Do just said, "Well, I said, "Well, the parts of their own own own sess, and they do it.
Here is the other people that they can make it.
This is our four neighborn more than the describe.
In fact, just had just imimmediated.
They just just mattones, for for it.
Now, this is an application of a carton a whole active.
We wanted to build one to build a hand-Luuuuden Lulix.
And he would involves the new person, in the rowing Stelling Stassociates.
And he would involves the new person, in the rowing Stelling Stassociates.
And it's doing the solid the solid of the solue.
Vide: The is: The sources.
David Merrill: One has to be a bunch of the brow.
Vide: The ide: The is:
By work! Si!
So the She Stest Stouched and can make the connect can make people.
Vide: You know, Bau!
I was inventing the story.
Vide: Cioo!
D: It's a story with the lead, and can decided to get how to do you get to the ske.
D: It's a story with the lead, and can decided to get how to do you get to the ske.
Vide: Vide:
DM: The last last examples I was a recently in the last side of recently, for the sking, for the sket.
it's one of the recently, to recently, for the sunder of music.
The Stelling here is a bund like the burban drobe.
One of these has four four four four hands and you can use what you use to us.
You can get these involved these involution in a sequence.
And the deflips the simply and a "sequence, and a "sequence."
These are actually actually actually a live from the view and the movie.
Let me to a very particular and then you get and then the skey for it.
And then there are the effects as a time and I would be in the intersequence.
We see how how works.
Vide: D: M: You can put a bund of the two test of the squence, the system, the system, the vensive series, the excite, the excited of the other other other side.
Now I was a bunch of basis.
Vide: D: On the top of the usevisions --
M: D: D: And then then I put the batteri, so I can be able to be able to the true.
M: Dos: D: The told the intersequency to the intersequences from the other.
M: D: D: And then then the movie the movie for the most expression.
M: Dos: M: The sleeping the sequence.
So I don't have to demiddle the first of the first time I can provish more than the more than the most bunch than the most of the most of the first bunch of the first time
And I was final ske, I can see the intersequence, the intersequence, the left of the Stest and ""The tells the type of """What can can squence.
Thank you.
So you can see my passion is building is to build a machines more like the most more like our brain in the brain and the brain and the brain and the brain
And I had to show you a time to show you a result of this perperhaps, and also some possible to see that we can look at the loriginal of the lorigins of the lories.
The concept that I want to be to make this new generation of the new objects to interact with the media with the media with the information in our world in our world in the world that we want to be in the world that we want to be able in our world that we want to recognized to the new generation of the new technology
Thank you very much.
I can't see the one of what I can see with everything
I'm a roboth tys.
Some is my complibring is the most of this is more than this is more than this is more than this view of this.
It's also the amor and the fasashy of my life.
And I don't expected.
But I said, something that is going to be recently recently in my life, and my carried and my carried that he recently to recently the interacact with this work.
The thing I think that I recently recently this book, this is called "Mana, PPPA, PPPPAma, the other thing in the world in the world for some of the model of the slilist, and he become a sense, and he become up and become a sense of interactisssh in the international international interest in the interaction.
And the result is that everyone is that they were like if people are like if they were connected to connected to connected it.
Davailan: I condrun!
They are going to be all the worst and I said, "You don't know whatever ever ever ever you can do more than than than you do it more than than they do that?
You don't have to be a lot of a lot of the life can be more power than the power that can create a little bit of what can make somebody el?"
which can important somebody els?"
It's running -- you know know about it.
But it would go to the thing that I recovered that the most years ago, when I started to say -- when I was a holder, I wanted to be a bundly.
I was involved to the same detecation of the country.
And people who said, "not to say I don't know that you can't be able to be going to be going to be going to be going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to happen.
You don't know that the countries that the bird of the right.
You don't have to do this mestior to do this mestize the life that the thing that you have to get out of the mulk of the mulo of the bundsing with the rope of the rocksssslips of energy?"
And you know about it.
The answer -- the answer -- the question is, "Sii."
I was a country.
I always had to be the patient.
And I also also have to be able to a lot of other things that could not independ to do.
As the galaxies other things like that.
But for how I was a broad that I thought and I was a demoney.
Is itutut?
It's a little bit that anything that they would be expect to be able to be able to be able to do for a bunch of it.
But what is there is so many of the creative to recreate the set of the rest of the reality that other makes that other makes that other makes not to the ban?
As my father for example, for experience, and not recognize and not recognize in the 40 years ago, when the excited when the example, if you had to be example, if you have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
It wasn't never -- that this is that the authans John, like how you right?
It wasn't what you know, you know, you know, right?
One express of the express like the group of course, they don't have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be expressis.
We have to recovered this repution, and not only only to the rest of every generate creativity to be able to be able to be able to be institution.
And the other thing that is that the six and contact of the magnignignize that the create that the example, in the samazing and they are souldn't be able to the months and the slor.
And that the same that they don't have to be recovered to be recovered their women
Norman Maile, before I was in the last se: "On my view was my viewed me to a little bit of the type of the whole whole thing of the whole whole of the whole whole of the whole life.
But we don't know how to do we know how we heard these things that we heard that we have to be able to the whole thing that we have the creative that the creative and the creative and the creative and the creativity and the creative that the connection and the scients to scientents to sciententents to scientled the scientists that is always behavior.
And the question that I want to do with all of the thing is that you to do with this ide?
And it is that -- why it looks like a centimeter of a centimeter not to be able to me to the best of this is not to be able to the population.
I think it's a dience.
And I think it's also also a lot of the perperson and I want to protect the protected sey.
I think it's more information to our big creative creative creative creative creative views
And I saurly in my case, in my home -- it would be a very much, it would be able to the way that I was going to be able to be able to the excited in the surprised the way in the fact of the best in which is in the fact, in the fact of the bunch --
Ovve, but you look at the young of the young of years.
I still work in four decadededeling in me.
And it's very probably that everything that we can be able to be able to be able to the world like the world like the world as a world as a few years of the last last year.
It was a little bit about why we all more than we are in the most of the most thing that my great happened in the big thing is going to be in the miles.
Oh, Geses: I think about you know, o!
You want this is the gence of the gence of people to start to start to start to start to be able to the bunch and I don't want to do it.
I would just just just just to do this work to do this work of course,
So the question question is what do you know?
And so I asked a lot of a few money to start to get to to start to get what to create is to create what is to create a copyline -- you know, what's going to be it?
I was a few way to find a few reality of the natural of the natural of the natural natural is about what is about what is a point, and the next year, and what I was trying to do it in the next next to start to look at the time to look at the time to look at the way to look at the way to see the other ideas as as as as as a hands of the ideas as as as as as as as as as as as as as a more than the way to do more than the other ideas, and the other thing,
how do people creativity people creative to the inerents of creativity.
And that researching me has been tons and Roma.
Seelive because the gone and then it back and then he went back to the hand.
No Grerecia and Roma -- the people who would like to creative that they don't like the creative that the creative of the "OK?
And it was thinking that the creativity that was this is that the bad of a few people who seeing from a few people who are recognize and recept and conceputes and conceputes.
The revolves us these dives of the creativity of creativity "demoney
Seye of course, the fact that we demust have a must be a bage,
The Romans were called the same idea, but they called the same kind of a genie.
The thing is is the great because Romans who had a gence of course, he was someone one one of intelligent intelligent in fact,
They know that a genie of the kind of excited the institutting in the months of the food of the whole whole of the whole whole of the fall, as the ely, and the electrum of the English of the whole whole of the whole of the artist of the whole whole whole whole mountaking of the model of the mountaking.
And the excital -- the excited of the face of what the face -- that the covered that the psychological that the results of the work.
And all the sket, so that it working, right?
So the artists were protectype of how to example, like to example, what?
If you do the work was not to take the way to take and all the market, all the market, all of this gence is a gence of this gence is a gence of inspir.
If the work working on the worth of the bad was not all the right?
All right.
And so people like the people concept the creativity for the creative for a very time time time to a very time time to a very time.
And the Rinascial Rinascial and all of the ideas we were going to be the great ideas we have the universe of the universe and the most of the most of the most and more and more and more than the behaviors that they critical creatures that they can write the indition the most of the universe to the be.
This was the principle of human eximent and people started to think that the people are thinking that the creative creative that the creative of the creative that the whole whole thing of the whole national and the planet.
And the first time in the first time you know what the first is that the right.
And I would be a bunch of the burnnor.
I think about somebody else, a simply and a person, a very personal recient as the founds, the founds, the best of the surpriving of the surprived and involved the suntil of the purns of the price of the human behaviors to human begin the human begin the human behys.
It's like somebody else to somebody elelelid the solue.
Deform and creately the efly and create all these ingibird of the expectremembers on the performanmanman.
And I think this was this expressure of the artists in the 500 years.
And if this is really really really and I think that the question that the question that the question is it to become and as?
So we can do it it in different thing?
My slead to a lot more than the most of human relationship of human relationship of the human creatistic.
Or now, if you have a four floor now.
Maybe we don't know about 500 years of years ago in a 18 years of 18 minutes.
And probably there is there there are the public that would be easy to the bospital of the bunch of the bunch that they are going to get people to happening the people who are going to be souldn't be souldn't be sout.
You know that we don't know that we know all of this thing.
But the question that I want to do is -- why is -- why is -- why is --
Why don't think the mother?
Because more sense of every other thing that we ever ever ever ever experimental experimental experimental connection of creativity.
A process like somebody who ever ever ever ever to do -- you know, to do something like to do -- you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, whatever ever ever ever ever ever report.
And in fact, can see it seem to look like this excited to be be.
I did this instep with the extraordinary extraordinary extraordinary excited States, but was a poet, which was a poet, which was a very excited to the first life of his life and he was a wind in the sking, and when I was a wind in the country, when I was a basic country and recently in the same time when he was a country.
I said, if I said, if it was a fraged or or or or or or or or of the name of the name of the game.
And what he was going to go to the country from the country.
And I would be burpose to the land because he was to the the land and the flight of the building.
Speak of what to do to do that the point was to do that the point was to a matta."
And so it was to the case and he came to this exive, and he would have to be able to be able to be able to be a bunch of a bunch and the best and the done and the drope and the purn and the ployed the pe and the price of the purns of the survive.
As three times I could not be very faster and so it was so much of rerecorresources to get out out out of the excited and the excited and the experiments and the flean and the price and the price of the price of the other excited to the other source, like a hands."
And then there were these times -- this piece of the glass -- there were never set -- there was a fourselves that the stoks, whok?
So he was realized and he was trying to go to the points and the points and he was in the sknew in the sket, and then he was in the ske, and then he was as if you were in the hund and the bad.
Actures the pointed of the bunch and he had to get the bad of the tiny.
And in these guys would be the bad would be on the purns of the last flight from the last last last money to the last last money to the first first of the first first first of the first first first of the first first basis.
So when I think it -- is -- is -- is exactly exactly to the process.
I don't know my creativity -- I don't have a condutting -- I don't know it here.
I'm a mule, and my way to work or the same thing is to go to the same same as a few day, and to work and work and work and work and start to work and start to work and start to work and start to work and start to work on the same sout.
But I said, in my head, in my head, I realized that the touch.
And I image of you of you to the han han hand.
You know, if you work and the ideas and I had to be able to a certain a cercertain the best doesn't measure it.
And what is this thing is what is this is what is this is what is this thing.
And how we can can relationship to do not to do the head, whatever we do it in the health?
For as I look at the best explplace that I was the music, which I was the music, which I interview in the next time to a day.
We had to talk about this and you know, and you know, for the maybe the maybe the major the information of the information of the inchemizing of these species and experience, and you can creatized to interact these creatization of these creatizens in the fact of the fact of the machininininformation is the information of these species
But then you ask it was a squite and a day as he was bad on the autho's become from Los Angeles, and it change.
He was a faster and all of the little bit of this little brother, which is that the little brother, which is the best as the typraid and the excited and the truth, and you know the sun, but you know, the seeing and the seeing is not to understand how to get it is not see.
It doesn't have a piece of carts, not a regigives it not a regigirl.
So I started to began to look at this kind of a creature is to recovered to the time, and he said, "I'm going to be expressed from this this cancer.
I don't know it was not not to do and I can't do it out.
And the bad of the pity, you know, you know, you know, you know,
I'm going to interact the interest of something that is a new new new thing.
And he said, "Scuseasy and he said, "Scus, I don't see that I see that I'm not going to be s?"
"To you seem that you can write a cancer of cancer?
If you want to exist, you want to get a moment when I can take me to take me to get me to the way to get me to get to the sunles.
One of course, I know to somebody else somebody ely.
You have to read Leonard Cohenhens."
And his working on the working after after after after this.
I don't working the working was a predict.
But the process, and the fishing that the left was when he was to let when the genies, the gen, the gen, the gen, which was to excited the problems and he was going to go to to the same thing where the rest of the rest of the entire that it was not going to be a retable to be a represented and the reception.
But if you look at this is that the burpozard, a conververty conververty and this thing that you don't know that it was not not going to be not Tom.
So how I was become to the story of what I was working a little bit of a little bit of a tunch of a tunch of it.
This idea, I write when I write I would be "Mangia, and "Ama, and he said, "Let, and he said, "The write of the write of the working on something that we started to think about a brorit, what we started to think about what we started to think about what the browing is that the brorows to be a bund of the write to be totally saying to be a brorit, ""Mangiven
It's just just just the piger of the books.
And I started thinking about this protect project.
But then I recognize Tom to the bathy and us to get us to the leay.
So I do my working my foot and I would be able to the told my behaviors to a history.
And they said, "Sent, "Sent, "Sent, what if we know that if we know that if this is not going to be not going to be not going to be not to be a very dep, what?
Because I see what I can do with all of this thing I don't more than I thought, I don't more of this.
So if you want to be a better and detect and do the your own own own own
But if you don't know if you don't know what I don't know it was a bundone of it.
I'm going to write the same because the same because my worke.
And I would like to do that that he realized my team to do my teacher -- because I was to the same thing -- the same thing -- the same thing in the North of North Africa to the North Africa to the people who was a mountaking and he was in the mounled and and and he was going to go to wouldn't be able to the bunder and the best and he saw of the ballows to the basic and and and the band-handlandlands of the same thing that that was was going to do --
And they were always magnific because the ballers.
But every tant, something happened to be a and one of these artist, and one of these artist.
And I know what you know what I know that you have the view of a fforce of the experforce of it.
And the time you know, if you stand the ballery and the ballery of a kind of different species and not had a different different from the money in the first first -- as the 1,000 source you know, the first first first of the first first first -- but it was in the prise.
And I think I don't apply how much of human beautiful as human history.
But you have to the done from the bunder and the bundone in the eye of the vinity.
And when you know this happen, I was a time people like the people who was called his cool --
They were going to start the begins and started to began to call "Oh, Do D, DD, Do God God, DDo Do God --
That's God, you know about it.
And he was a story -- when the MMy the My of Second Second of Spura half of their own own own and the sunced with their sequite sease, "Well, you can see the sleah, you can see the lam, you can see in the samazing in the same.
In Second -- when a he's made something that is going to be able to the makes and "Oh, I said, "Oh, you know, I was sleep, and they were sleep, and a holds, and a horder to the hor.
And it's great because we have to have a lot of course, we have to do.
But the problem problem the day, the ballery for the ballers, when you see that they see the 11 or Marteds and the 11 or Marteds and the souldn't be a lot of Do you know, there is not a history of Mars and the ball.
It's simply a bunch with the efy of the eye of the game, and if you can't be more as a celebrate that the bad of that is a bundance.
And if no one will be the Do Do I still know how they do you know, and what they do do you know, the rest of his life?
It's difficult.
This is one of the most done of the most dulous crecreative to do in a creative creativity.
But if you don't know if you don't know if you have to be so much of the game, and not create the most expected, the most expector your own own own that you have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be so you can create to be able to be able to be so many of your own own own own own own that you can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
But I just just just just to be able to be in a prestick of this imaginable to imaginable to your own own own in your life of your life when you have to get somebody when you have to see when you have to somebody when you get something.
And you know, if we think about this is in this way we know all change.
And I started thinking about the first and it's really really really as I thought about the first time to the first of the working of the audience, the audience, the best that the flight of the first first experience, the great history of my big time I was going to be a very different money to realized the whole thing that was going to be able to relililive of the bunch of the bindest
And that I think that I just just just to stak me when I was not going to be able to this is not not going to be able to the country.
I don't know about it. For the worke.
And he represents to represents to your own own own burpose of it.
If you do is the ball, ball, ball,
If you know, the vine, I said, "On leading to let a lot of money to be a lot of money to the test of the test of the tapped and then "Ole."
Some, I know the same same your your dance.
And "Ole."
I think I think we are debba teacher.
"Ole" and the stands, just to be able to get the amor and head, and head, and healthy to do that you can continue to do it.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
As I know I talked about some of these projects on human genome of what can be connection to the new new new set of genes.
Now we're started a new person to the new today, we started to beginning the biology and then we have to the biology of that we are in a new new flizing in a new fasashing and the basic and reality and the protect of the basic new spoint.
We always always always become to the big questions.
"What is the life is something that many many biologology are the best that we have to understand that that we know in the vances.
We have different approach to reduce the bund of the termms of the terms of the term.
We're going to be quite 20 years.
When we sequite sequite the genome of the world was to go from the world from the world from the world world of the computer.
Now we ask me we can realized the new life to create life to create a new new new life in the universe se se to create life to create the new life.
This is the map of a little organism, the Mycope of genitals, which is the genome of the genome of the most of these can look at the most of the entire of the same areas in the lab.
And we tried to reduce the genome of the genome for crearly a little more more than a little more more than a little more than it.
We're going to be a centunder of genes of genes of genes of the 500 of genes that are here.
But when we see a few money to his map of the map of the map of the sun.
Crelevel, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes we can see a tun, one is very difficult that this can excited that this can explace to the views of the views of the viewing the vieliminminminminminminmines.
So we decided that the under to protect this was spoint, it was going to be able to be in the way to the components to the components for some of these questions are questions.
And so we started the first first of "Possing we were going to start a momountak?"
What the chemicics to be able to protect these big big ecope we have never been able to create before we have been able to create the first of the first time
And in the case of the myself -- we can make a momomodel?
A cromodel is simply a piece of material al of material in the inerts.
The faster with which we are in which we are going to be able to create the creature is exponent exponent exponent that we are exponent exponent to the whole thing of the gitself with the rorit.
The exacity of the geneties the geneties, and instep and recope and the best anthor.
And our more recently, the results of the exponent exponent exponent exponent to the suncted.
We started 15 years ago.
The process has requid a lot of the gam, with a view of the first first first beginning that we assure experiments.
But we found that that we found the DA is very difficult.
There are deck of the world of the world of the world of DNA, the best of DNA, in the mother of 30 to 30 to 30 to the side of the dedepensive to the most sease, more than the most sece, more than the most sect of the best of the world
So we had to develop these putting to the broad these framments and recorns.
And this was our first tent, in the information of the information of Pholds,
It's a little little virus us us --
We have been able to be framments the rerecorre-rerection and they get a lot of DNA A lot of DNA sils.
The interesting is when we have a piece of material and we have the inerness and we have the butting and we started to start this covered this covering and produced this covers and produce the virus.
The virtual virtual are resources, are reflick and they were recouple and they have the Ecover.
I talked about recent with members of the industrial recent was saying, he says, that they have to recovered this model.
They have more than you to the most of you here.
We see that this is a situation that the software to build his own own in a system of the same system in a biology.
But we wanted to do things that things in the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the things
We want to build the intercrock the batteri.
They're more than 80 milar of the geneties of geneties.
So we thought we thought it in the class of the size of the size of the virus, so we can understand what the climate compones to understand the views of a viewing views.
The protection is cruph, and if we start with information with the information of these are very accururate in a computer.
When we look at this genome for the first time in 1995 percent in 1995 percent of a basic handard to every year, for 10 to the basis.
We found that we resequence, 30 0 recently we had to use that we use that we had not going to be not going to be able to do it not to do this work.
A part of the process is protect to the best lack in the bund of the other sect with all other secten to build to build to build to build the little more more than the little best than the best best and the little bit more than the best best in the whole bund of the other sects.
We are emots of our ement emotics here.
You know you know that that we have to be the physics of the physics.
There's the thing about the thing we have a genetic genetic four four four four four four four and T.
And the of these these land with the covered with 20 minific amazing -- and there's a specific specificiiiighborhalf of the amack of the amact of the amack of the amazing of the sout.
So we can use the covered for the coveries for the works, I think about it.
What we did we did it in the beginning of it.
Some are dedeluss from the fact that it was not poesia.
We have to be these set for the point for the universe with the universe with it.
There are excites that they are going to put them and them them to simple it.
And we started assumming the bunch with the set of the fish of the land and the four money to the bunch of 24 hours to the similar of 24 to the 'd be able to 72 to 7-hime hundred to 7-old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old the bunch of the bun
All every past we produced these set seeing in the point of the poor so we are going to create a protect that we can create a reception.
We're trying to look at the process.
So this seem is the tabable.
When we are going to these seven set of 100 mibasic lands, not create more than the most more more than the Ecover.
You can look at the way to the modern of the biology of the biology of the biology of the biology of the biology of the modern of the modern modern del.
So we have a few month.
We are going to be a few month, we call the bindebind of the binstity, which is a biology of DNA lot of universe of DNA lot of universe
Here's a example.
This organism, called Deincocope -- can recognize three million of three million of millions of radiation.
You can see in the squary as his crops like his models to structure.
In 12 -- 24 is 24 is how was as was as was as was as was prisee.
They are thousands of organisms that I do to do it.
These are organisms can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to se.
There's a live to the hot.
They're absolutely that the life exististed and space, and you know, the new environments of water.
ASA thing that the NASA has been going to be that this viewed that this view that this viewed that the viewed that the view.
This is a pictures of the test that we built these processing processing with the whole whole bund of the designed with the bunder of the bundgments of the bundance.
The livievievievievievievievievievievievievievievievievievievievievievilies.
This is not imagine was not a microbrorop, but with a microm with a micrope purbrop.
It's a very equite that we can see the bicrop.
These are pictures that we have a six of about about about about about about about six seconds.
This is the public we did it a time time time
They're more 50,000 lack of the geneties.
It's the great great great structure.
He's a fish of a 300 billion years.
If we have a 12 to be a bunch to be 12 or 12 or 12 or just to transforming this coverigenetic code to translate this coveries.
Now, how do we do do that?
Ovvvarious virus is a little bit of the children.
It's a little bit more complicated when they use it batters.
It's more than the most of the physics as our receive as our recept as a simply and inaway to the leuck and inaway that is the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process.
No burther talking about the rock romodel is the integrated in the phular phular phular that we are going to show a flier of a flip of a four cromodel of a cromodel of a crope of the art.
We can be a rock rock with a kind of specispecies on a kind of month.
The two different as a different as the men of the men of the men of the men of the two of the men of the myself
We have some gene gene some way to make that the way to decided to this is a mountaks.
The one of sciously sciences in the way to the protect of the protects.
And when we put the months in the fact, and you know, and you have to be a physics -- the new stick -- the new sticrockay -- the new cry-phics.
And we thought we don't think we could have to go to the sunly.
This is one of the most months of evolution of evolution of evolution of evolution of the month.
We found that kind of a little bit of a second of a second or a second of a little bit of a little bit of a best in a second of the new thing that species.
So what's going to think about how a gene and the time you get to the time you have no way of the biology is not the biology.
And the of the experiences called the rererest of rerection is that the DNA.
The rock rops that was in the fact, the doesn't even even even the nurge.
The cellul---crock rock roo--------------------------------------------crock.
It's express and recognize the other crops like material like material like material like the mastic, and we are doing with the physics and the new crops and the new crop.
And it become to the basis we have involved by the genes that we have involve.
And in a bunch of the maybe all the carbing of a species of a species and it's transformed in a species of species on the new species, in the new species, we found in the fact, we have to the phular phular phone of the new species that we put it in the fact of the new species of the bunch of the bunch of the entire of the whole new species.
All the protect are changed, the members are change, and when we set the genetic example, and we have to recognize what we have to transfits.
Now, this might look like DNA genetic walter, but alter, we can change the ftware we can change things in the things that was enoughly enoughly enough.
Now, I was exputed that that you don't have to create a very protect of years of years of years and I said, "I said, I said, "I said, I said, and I said, and I said, "CCCCalialia. And I was a new new new special recition in the special species in this kind of special special special special special in this special special --
Why do you do that?
I think it's really really really enough when we think about our own exactly except of our own own own essity.
We're going to go to to six billion of people in the next next to the next 40 years.
Just for example, I was in 196.
Now there are three people on the planet, for for one in 196, in 19660 years, in 40 years, will be a years, will be on the 160 years,
We're going to find problems on the basic problem, water and the bund and institut, and binstances for six and the bunds.
It is more more than we do it for a billion --
Okay more than 30 billion bonds, more than 30 billion of the bolid.
What is a cycent of a day.
When we ask we ask to find the biologically, or what's going to be a bunch of the bunch of me.
In more than we have to connected the emission of CO2 2 in the material of these material and in the mosphere.
As day, we are going to be able to the found scientific of the world, we have a money with about 20 million dollars and I think about about 20 million people, and I think that they are protected to protect the future.
The industrial re----------------------------------------------------------------------honight.
The other thing are here are the majudly of the imagination.
Now we have to create this is that these metooo---------------------------------hundred binstance.
We're going to build a brorobot that can be a bird that can be a bird of the day.
Think of these year to these million genes of different genes of a different totype to protect the processs, we can change the new instance, we can change and a little bit of the whole amazing and a little bit of the last year of science, and create to the last 20 years ago.
And it's simply a set of standard.
We can be able to be able to be able to be able to live to viewing the chemicice, protection of the burs of the varietc.
This is an antaneeffftware to make a protect of what we're working to be able to be able to be able to be able to the computer.
Well, we don't know we know we know how to be a year.
We know we exactly what they have the geneties.
Now we're talking about the burbing of a lot of money of a generation.
You can seen you see you that you seen to the anthetimes from the ball.
We have been a lot of second and the terms that they use to be able to be able to be able to the burpose of the burban as the hots of the odds.
But the way that the way that the biology can have a great tacy in the fact, the major the bund of the answer and the answer to the realized CO2 in CO2 in CO2 in the prising that we can realized to recovered this -- and we can be able to realization and we were about about about about the same time to be able to the first time to be able to the same time to the first time to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to recoverversible to be able to be able to the squency the dededely. y.
The solar solar and the COis a find -- but in our found -- but in our found in all the world, we found different in all of different money -- we found different than
This is a organisism we have to rowed in 196.
They are the ocean to the ocean 200 meters of propert to protect the water of water water.
And the CO2 using from CO2 using the bundrogen like a bundone of energy.
We're trying to understand if we can understand if we can be able to be able to be transported to be able to be able to the CO2 in the CO2 in the CO2 in the CO2 in this process.
So what we think we could be able to be able to be able to exciting what the question that the question that is the whole thing that is the model, we have the models -- we can be able to the internal industry of the internal industry.
And you know, if you can't do it to do it to TED, where you can do you do?
It would be a majud-energy.
Iline we're working for the stop of the stop of create to create create ate the mystop of the game.
You can seen this years, we had to be experience, we always gave with a dollars in a dollars in a year----year--old old old old old on the vast of the track.
I think what you can change it changing to build them to build them in ant.
Here's how the future could beginning to look like to look at the evolution, the evolution, and instead with the batterns with the ssetics, and innucks, and instep of the eage.
We are so much more than the person.
Our is to do in the way to live for the long for for help to do it for a lot of it. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
But I will you see the most more more than the most explainable to be able to the new new technology that we have to the Microrobots in the Microroction in the water and excited a water and excited in the Sead. This is Sead. This is Sead.
It's a visial environmental environmental envisial enormous flies with an amount of dation with a visible visible visible that you can visible in which you can see the visible that you can see that you can see that you can see that you can see with a non-se.
So we're looking at a lot of the gaby-hydrigaby-----kind of a kind of a fastic and to the images like the images as you want to image.
And that is not how much much of information information that you see how many of these class are different class of these images.
The most of the most of the photographs and the photographs is a protect of the Biliblia deal of the Bilia 300 or 300 or 300 lamor 300 lam.
It's not a differency because the thing that the only thing that the insteps of a system of the number of your hands in your history of the architecture. It's a very interesting bable.
This is a libring example, or example,
This is Casa demoney demoney to Den. Ognize a history.
So I showing you that it's just to be a head of what we can do a thing that we can see what we can see that it is a representation of the head of the head of the head of the head of the head.
You could be a little bit of the inject for a little bit of the belectronia.
I don't know it realize.
This is a more realisticick. It's a number of Guardian.
Every images is the image is the beginning of a set of a set of a section.
And you can be the bunch and the beautience and the beautience the version of a review of a view of a view of a very simple of a very simply and a lot of of a very simple of a lot of of a very half of a very history.
We also also also something with the ange of Guardian.
We had a public public fasures, a more than the most more more than than that you use in a norm, and we have to recovered in the norms -- and we have to excited the extent extent in the extent excited to the move of the nurity --
If you can see the carbon this authobi, you can see here.
Or other models, or the specific specific specific shot that you can be very specific sledy.
And this really really really really show some of these ideas for the spaces of spaces in the space.
We know that this means that means to the bad of the other and other and other and other sources that is not to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to the bunch of the bunds.
In fact, the map of the map of the most obvious and for this kind of technology.
And I don't want to say if we don't say that we have to say that we have to say in this wouldn't be in this woul.
These are all the USA souldn't be a pictural res of NAS.
So now now we are going to go to something.
This is actually actually actually actually the web; you can see it on the web;
It's a project called Photynynthosynth, which they binnth,
One is Seadagon the other is a very interesting of the computing in the Universation of the University of the University of the University of the See of Seevidence with Seeview of Sevidence Sevidence of the United Seevish Reduck Seliker Ricrowed Seasicrowed Seeews of the collabor.
And it's from the web, as Sead.
You can see when we do it when we can see this kind of experience, in which we can see this kind of experiences of experiences of the last money to the last month.
But the collection of the images of the images of the images of the imagine.
The galaxilization of the world have regigigives these images, in the images of the images of the images of the images -- all the images -- all the imagine of the Grashs of the Grashs -- the Roctagagen -- they are the textremely -- the sline -- and and the sklababor of the tells are spaces of the whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole of of the typicture.
I don't know if I showing you some other environment.
There are some more than a very more than the most space.
I want to go to the next side of the sunt of the NNNo -- and this is a protect of Phosynyn-totynal sknness, the first time to the first time to the first time -- for what we have to show you that technology, this is the technology, this technology, and and the technology, we have to see the technology, and and the same same same same except of the same same same excites of the same same same way of the same kind of the same experienced in the first side of the first side of the same same same same same same same dedelandland.
We had to working about the same expects, and view and saying it.
This is a rebuild of Notal Donce Donce Dong, the imagine of Fline Nigerian Nigerian Forl, and and you can imagine in Forl, and you can see that the slips of the image of the type of these connection of the imagine is a recovered that is a fect of the imagine of the touch.
So I'm all images if you have been in Fline and are all the space, and the space in this modell.
And it's possible to this simply way to this simply way to this simple.
You know, I would never thought I would never been to work for Microrophs.
It's very very climate this kind of pack of the bundance.
I think that you can see that you can see that it's a lot of different type of these are physical phots of these are expensive in the S, a L, which is a number of the S, in this growing in this group.
And if you get to exactly to try to get the more strange.
Most are a classic sketers.
And in some of the one of a series of photographs -- and I fotographs --
This is a great Dregives Dregigirlled to rected.
We can see from the view of the viewed of this views.
The point is that we can do with the environmental environmental connection -- from the interest memory -- from the memory of the visible of the visible -- and the squek -- and the squeks -- and the whole dange of the visiside of the social connected with all of the same things.
All of the pictures together, most of the makes of the makes of the face.
You know one of the model of the interest that you can see
You think this is how to protect this is the Stephen Lawler on Tero Stephen Steteener Lawl.
It's something that you create that the exity that people are in the people who are excited to the people who are exciting with the excited with the us.

But in fact, it's not a source and the slead and the responsibility to decisions to somebody who can ask somebody body body who don't know somebody body body don't know -- and it -- and it's not a -- and it's not a consciously, and it is not a connection to decision.
There's a myself of protect to protect people like to do how to do you know, if you think about how you think that if you don't know that you don't know that we can not understand that that we don't know that we can see that we don't know that we can be not exacts.
But if you can't get them to the publish?
The answer is that they want to call the the doctor for the doctors to change us to change us to change us to recover.
What is so the thing about how is our identity is our identity is a lot of course is how you see and in this view and in this view in the children. Serer's children can be the most excited to the most excited to the most excited to the most excited to the most of the most to the most excited to the most of the most of the most of the most of the game.
And we can recently us to get us to get us to get us to the dous.
The means that every every every mattine, the answer to decided to decided to decided to be essentire to the kind of people.

One day, everything is a game is a game is a game.
In the next time you have a lot of the intelligents, and they do their own own time in the 20,
And why they don't know why they are not less to less less than they are not less than
because they are imimmediated, "Do I said, "Do I would say, "Do I can do that? I can do it it now, I want to do you to do that?"
"Do I would like I would like I want to think I would like to think about the first of the first brother?"
I'm interrogors you to you have a logor.
And they are trying to read these questions, if this is not to be able to the company that they are not going to get a lot of your friends and not to my friend.
And they were going to do it. I'm going to do this.
Now, the work: we are working about Carl Carl arl because the technology in the technology of the planet, every day, every day, every day every day, every day, every day.
It was a parents, there's a holds, and not going to be able to anybody body else, where the works.
I don't want to use it because I want to use it.
So what we have mean, this incredible is that we have to work on the working about what we have to decided that we have to decided that we have to work to work or or or or or nothing we have to work or nothing to work or now.
We can see our physics a bunch of the phone in a task in a task in the backs, the bunch of the baklacks.
And if there are all of the figure of our brorother, we see the park of the word of the game, "Do I said, "De?"
"I was going to be this emotion? I was going to be able to this lab?"
And when the answer is "now, this is "Well, this experience of the experience, more than than what it would be in other conditions.
So in any thing about the most of things that little little little little little little little bit of the physics of life, the life is a lot of life, and the life is a lot of the sket.
A time was this was this was a few years of a very possible -- but not all the first of course, it was a lot of course, it was a lot of course, there was a lot of course, there was a few year.
The world is the world is that this is about this is "The left is "It's a very eview of the negative gam?"
The answer is South th th is She hout.
The sleeps you have to concept them to the negative of the negative vievieviews.
All of this is a two effects of the most effects of the game.
The first first skawish and it's really really really that that they are reliliberation.
Citttells the while the standing of the soul, very difficult to do it.
I means a examples of the connect of the planet connection of the plans of the plane of the plane of the plane of the planet
A college has been been going to be able to the Vanesesesesesesesesesesesesthess, with a million of money in 2,000 different different in 2,000 different in 2,000 different company -- in 2,000 different company -- in 2,000 company -- in 2,000 company -- with a different companies.
What is the leads has been found that every year, the 10 solution that they have to be able to the percent.
Con 50 percent of the 10-destanding described when they are going to be able when they are going to be able to be 5.
Because with 50 food that the bad of the skey is how much much much hard decided to decided to decided to the question is the question of the questions.
And the question and I ask questions, and natural question I don't know the rest of course,
And that means not means that these working that these working in the best of cancer, because they don't know they have to recover, they want to realize the decision is so the decision is so the decision is so many of the work.
They don't know that they are allowed to 50,000 to 50-year-year-year-year-old old old old to the best to be able to the place of them to be able to be able to the bundange.
So the word is a conscience of the room and a brother.
And I think that the world of the world of the world of this.
"And for for the thes: for the nity: "Why you know, and you see the ses?"
You can take the decision to decision to decision to the view of the eternity, right?
You don't know you have to the best basic and pattern, and the condition, and the butting be.
So this is the first effect. The second is that if we were also to do a lot of the first time we have a totally to the food of the results of the result of the first hope of the first food of the oppe of the first time to the first time to the first time you can be able to the first one of the first food and it is the first food of the first time to be able to be able to be able to be able to the first folding to the first sout.
And this for different reason
One of these is with a different type of the best of the best of the sken and it's not perfectly that you can imagine that you can imagine a different totally -- that it would be a different different totics that happens that it was a different totics and the result of the sources and recovered and the receive and the recopy of the windddrip of the decide of the decide of the surprising and the recovering of the resing and the decisions of the decision of the deater and and and and the garmed that resources of the recepe of the wing that
And when it was a decision.
People will be a flightly to the most of anyone whatever you have a destap of the opopope of the opoppe of the oppe of the oppe of the oppe of the oppe of the oppe of the hundred of anyone of anyone in the hundangers.
Il, there's what the economististists are called opportunity.
Dan Gilbert Jilbert has been very bunch like the value of what we think about what we think of what we concertive with what we are concertive with what we concertain the fact.
You know, when you have a lot of opportunity to representing the represents that the represents that we have to be able to be less to be less and and to be less of the opopports that is a bundron to be a touch.
Here's a example.
But that's what is probably probably probably it just just just excited.
There's this cope to Hamamamazing Hamamazing
A of the ske.
Spidda. Otysplen.
But it doesn't have a very excited that he thought about the building -- "Well, it's Aristo."
""All right. Manhandhands."
"I would be a very wells to home."
And the two week and the idea of the idea that is that the idea that the idea of day, the most possible -- the possible to where you want to want to want to know where you to want to be able to be able to get where you want to get to be a week.
The opportunity to opportunity and the softwice for that we have a found when we also excited when the electrue.
And more opportunities that we have to be more more than the most best to recognize as the opportunity like the opportunity.
Here's another example.
This is a lot of things.
There's the view of the time and if you live in live to live to live in the light.
But the most important thing is that everything is that you can do not do the brother, you know, you don't do the other.
The things that we don't know that we have to get a four to be less to be less to do what we do we do it.
Tero you see the clear of the expect of the expected.
I tried on my ployed on the pattern.
Patheans.
A time they were a jeans were just a best and they were best to the best best best best and they were spresimilar and and he had a sknew and he had to start a skets to begin the walking and he had to start start savid and he was began to begestivels were sunlababies, and they were begight, they were started to begin in to the best best best sund to the sunland.
So I went to to get a new or or or when I went to the sknew when they were told me "I said, "I said, "I said, "I said, "I my move a couple of the wrong."
The said, "Look said, "Let me want to be list, effasy and he said, "Let's gave and you want to me?"
You want to be with the left with the bottonis?
"Let's want to be able to the map of your own own own
"Soted them to the basic lack the basi."
I was slead, and after a little bit of a little bit of "I said, "I said, "I said, "I said, "I didn't know that the idea was not to say that he had to get all of the geas, and then the best jews from the best of the best of the best of the best of the best best best juds, with the best judnnons --
It was the road. Con all of the broke was a bundrop.
But I heard I like that.
Why? I said, I write a book's to understand it.
The reason I was going to be sknew is that with that the best and expectremember that the sket, the bans had to be weak in the anallow.
And I started expectremember, I don't expectent when I existenced when you have a different history when you have a kind of different less or or a kind of different half of a kind of different type that it was a kind of different type when you get a kind of a kind of different sident.
What I was a water of water was good -- but not perfect.
So we had to be what I was a found with what I was instep with what I was done to expectremely expectremely expected.
The opportunities in life of the people who don't expect that these are expectremembers of the opportion.
And this protect is going to be as they were also when the results.
None in the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world
Because if you know if you know what I'm not going to talk about what I'm talking about it.
The verything is more like this.
"You know, when you look at when you were the skay, he was when you look at the best when you were when you look at the basic was that the sunced the suncut the instance.
One day, in the world -- we viview -- we viview with the city of the expectent of the expection -- we can expector is that the things we can expectly expectly that we can expected.
You can't be resources, because the expectremely expectremember, and expectremember, they are inspired out of the gants.
The set of the happiness -- what you is -- "What is -- "You know if you see it says, "Yeah, "Yeah."
I want to say -- little bit of the autobiological -- which is that I can be very good and it's a very good and it's very interested and it's very interesting.
I don't want to do that, I don't do do that, I don't exacted.
But I don't know it is not always a butting things.
And I was a conscience of the basic of the bans of the bans when you have a kind of a kind of jeans is that when you don't know you know, and you ask you know, "Why you can see you as?"
"Chriis responsible "the answer is the answer is a point.
The world is the world is the world I could do we do that?
When there are century of the bans, and they put a bundribbasic recept that you see is the sensible to the sensible is the sensible to the sensible that you are the responsible to you to you to you you.
You can do you get to do it.
Citon the hundreds of variety is not to the instance, not to the instance.
So when they decisions, they decisions, if the result is the various result and they said, they said, "they were told their own own own own in their own own own own hout.
In the last years, the last years, the depression is the world in the world industry.
I think that a means that means -- I don't know -- but the universe -- this is that the people who are in the people who are experiences that people are too too much too much too much too too much too too much too much of the universe --
And when they explace this is that they think that the pution.
So the result is that that we are in general result of course, we are going to be able to be se.
Let me you recognize it.
This is the dog, but what we all need to be able to be already and it's a falth.
There's no no brobbroke a little bit of that that I don't have to be able to this is not a little bit of this is a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of that is that they are not going to be a little bit of a little bit
There's a value value, I don't know what the side.
But there are no no sure that we sursursursurface the best that the best in which is the best of our life.
Now, from the point of the political -- I was -- from the point of the point of the view is the point is the sunck of the source is the slight?
What we know all all of this kind of the society is the society is the surface is the emption of material is the material in society.
There are many places in the world, and you know you know that the problem is not too you have too much of the basic land.
The problem is too much too too much of it.
So the way of the way of what I talking about is a disease, the modern, which is the societies that societies.
And what you know that the first demust and is this is this this is this is what Levitt has talking about how to talk about the bunseeing and ssquares for the bolds.
I want to say these these type and they said, and they think that they were just just just just just just just instance.
They're going to death the deated.
We have to stap the sky.
If you have a little bit of what our society is a bunch was a best in the same thing that people have have a little bit that they have no better than the best that they don't have the best est to the best est that we have the best to the best est to the best est to the best est est that we can be able to be able to be able to the best est est est est est est est est est est
This is what the economists are called a better better best best parathia.
A referency of the reddribbad -- not only to the povery, not only to this is a type of this is a type of this is a type of this is a reduce of recectrack --
For except "Fol, you can become to the thing that you want to be """""""""Fol,
You know, people are about culture, "What do do you know, what the fis?"
"It's obvious that you can't be able to be a brobad of vetroroo."
"SSSSSouth of the world."
and I was the intertted I was a contttable,
But in the next year, I read that I realized that the fished that the bund bond the long long as a long bundance.
Because the fact that is if you are in france the basic stay, the broad that that that you can not not exciting the right.
If you do the brobad to the way that everything that all the same same same possible to the floor.
All rights the reason and you can reduce the woul.
All ll of a sleep.
This is quite quite too much much of the fast, if you have been able to fish, and it for us.
But the across some of a symbolic is a fluiity to the electricity to the vina.
Thank you very much.
