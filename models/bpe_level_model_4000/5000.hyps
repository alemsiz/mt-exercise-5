The last year I started these didit of these conscious respect that the saving the saved by three million years that has been about 4-year-year-year-year-year-American American American American American American --
All of the detect of the problem because the problem because the problem you don't know that the sound of the policy.
The calcululating the respect is a conscious of the constructural of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the economic economic economic economy.
It is a pand-and the game and the game of the savies.
The next dedeal is going to be a very much from the last 20 years of the last 50 years.
The Paathy is the saved in the deep in the deep in the told.
As you see it it is going to be the baby to the hour own baby to the house.
And the water is the indiculating in the indiculululating the sest.
You can see the courage of the courage, five years or five years or five years from the site of the chanks from the corner from the corporary from the corporate from the corporate of the wild of the model of the courage of the courage, and the courage of the the save,
In the 50 years from the right right right right now.
This is a problem because the revolution is the conditional of the ocean is the ocean is the the most of the most of the most of the most of the conscious that are the the conscious problems, they are the constructure.
And the revolution of the instrument of the instrument of the conscious of the exployees that could be the revolution, to the same thing that we had to be able to be able to the country.
In some of a very very much of the Akkey is actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually re-hold water from the water.
The professentially was Kater Water in Akkey is a very very quickly with a little baby of the last last last last year.
Vir: Wow! Lor: Lor: Lor: it's going to be if we are going to be able to be us.
A reason is that this is that this is that this is the Grorom Genththank from the Gended from the Menthy from the Methy of the government of the government of the political that is that this is that this is that this is that this is that this is that this is that this is that this is that this is the the the Gerroroutttab
This is a fabured to me in the Pakake.
The site was never to reached the million dollars a million dollars.
This is the Kuubbaby of the German, in the Gerdidia.
If you want to know how the the the traditional of the saves of the save, where the rounds is where the saving is where the road of the smart of the rouncross' is where you want to be able to be the road of the saving the the rounck of the the saves of the the saving of the saves
These are the very very simple respected.
And the other of the plane of the planet, the most of the most of the planet.
The first time of the scientists have been been been been the courage of the chanks and the Anyyynththide the chrony of the revolution of the revolution, and the conscience, and the conscious conscious conscious conscience.
Every very fer to 3-year-year-year-didid.
Alln Himalalthough the third of the most of the cut, you see new of the hans, which was the time that the year that were the chaaaththaaaathaa.
The 40 percent percent percent of the population of the water was the water from the saving of the lightly of the deep deep the population of the population of the population of the population of the population of the population of the population of the population of the water from the population of the population of the population of the the population of the water
An Anddgone of the water is the the the water is the the water of this citizens.
The site is the lighted.
So I was going to be a little bit about the water on the water water in the water there.
In the China in the West in the U.N.
The chanks are the conditions are in the crisis.
The previsions, as you have a little bit of the things are all the things.
The really, the reference of the world to the respect of the smart of the saves of the smart of the world of the checture.
The strstrong the environmental economic strong the developing is a smart of the preventventional and not the preventing and without the extraordinary system.
The last 30 times more than the last 30 years that was about the last 35.
This is a saving of all the inities.
If you look at the contact of the contact of the contact of the conditional conditional conditional conditions.
In the last five years we have to revolution in the CO2 in the CO2 million -- 50 million people in the ocean in the ocean in the oceans in the oceans in in the ocean in the ocean in the ocean in the ocean in the ocean in the ocean in the ocean in the ocean in the ocean
Look at the Pactive of the Pactive or Ammming and the Ammmest, and the the most of the most of the continent in the ocean is a or of the oceans.
The more than the redition of the exployees that is the 20th century, which is the 20th of the reduce of the resible reduce of the reside.
The oil, and the most of the courage is a problem.
The United States are a two of the most of the most of the Cina.
And it turns out of a lot of the human reduce of the most of the parts of the same way.
But we're going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a change.
These are the new projects in the last few years and some of the last few of the devices of the devices of the last few of the last few years and some of the last few of the last few of the last few of the last few of the last few of the last few of the last few of the last few of the last
And every one of the smart of the Paaaaaway.
The economic and the most of the water of the 90 million dollars in the last 50 million dollars for the next to the program of the program of the courage.
What I was a picture of something --
And I have Natatatelse, where there was a 3-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year--year-year-year--year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year
Maybe you saw the good news in the ard.
This is the second more conflict of the Can and America.
It's been been in Natatata.
The sategy of a chapt of the the mainly of the most of the courage of the courage of the courage of the the main-hatelse.
Vird: Well the From is a kind of the courage of happy and happy of happy.
It's a lot of the America, and it is a very different economy.
From the coole is always more than the most of the time.
It's a good good way to the smart and the work of the work of the depended it it was depen.
Gor: The Wor: Corger West West West West Virga.
The most society society is the the deep of the Masy is his faby is his fababababababy of the exist.
Video: Don Brakensss; I was -- -- -- -- God Glly Reses: the Reses: the Res: the people are talking about what they're talking about what they're talking about about what are are talking about about what they're talking about about the world:
Gor: So the first time for the Goref Craizen Craise two minutes of the camera.
This is a one of a found.
Vir: Aggame in the ALLLoo: the changes we see how a detaught to our lives of our lives to our lives to our respect to our lives.
For this is the revolution is to a big thing of the most of the people in a tremendous to the revolution and the revolution of the deep of the deep of the same way on the same way on the same way to be able to the extraordinary of the initive to the device.
In fact, the most of the courage is not not the stop.
We think it's the flight-conscious conscience.
So what it doesn't preventure the change of the change.
Let me do we do it.
Vir: Abbbaby -- you know, you have been been going to talk about a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of the Eorbbely.
So I can see a very very different structure in a structure of the most of the most of the couurage of the most of the most of the most of the couurage to the couure.
Scicially the machine is a little baby of the human beyond the human human beyond the way of the human human bed.
The most of the most of the the main the the main the the developing of the fact that you see the most of the energy that you see all the changes that you can see all the same way.
Dan an an an an is this is the the deep of the technology of the technology of the deep of the deep of the technology of the technology of the technology of the technology of the energy of the exist.
Gor: Instead, the invity, the conservation of the exployees and the the most of the human human human human human human human human human human human human human community.
Vird: The South is in the economy, the economy, the economic of the government of the nature of the power of the nature of the nature.
The idea that the other other people all the reference of the revolution of the smart and the courage of the oild and the most important of the important.
Now, there's a new new new new activity, and the useful for the use.
On America, in the energy of the energy of the deep time.
A lot of the children to start to the work of the work of the most of the degrees to help the reference of the development of the development of the development of the developing of the developing of the developing of the human refers to be able to reduce the degrees to be able to the reduce to the re
And of course, a revolution that is the deep that our problems.
On America.
Gor: This is the fult.
Vir: The South -- it's about the energy to America.
One of the most of the most of the deep deal deep with the conditions that they have the planet.
And I was the future is here. This is here.
And I was 22: Nuurage for the people of the work of the work of the conditions of the condition.
S: The P: It's a very time of the America.
Gor: A very very much of the courage of the smart of the saving to the saved from the saved by the soldier.
If you want to go back to the other.
We have to go to the very quickly.
Thank you very much.
The last last last TED TED Talk Talk to TED in the LCC.
And it turns out of the gang to the way to be able to work on how it works.
So I was the last three days that the other people don't have a lot of the LLLLook in the most experimental scientific -- 27 million dollars -- 27 feet of the last year of the ocean to the most of the most of the other time.
The remodel is the revolution that were conditions that were less than a billion dollars a billion dollars a new new planet, to the universe -- in the last 300 million dollars a year of time.
All of the environment.
This is the Ginindge.
We have these these new new mo-Bang Bang in the rirights.
This is what I work on the AALLAAAAS -- is 14---year--year--year--year--year--year---year--year-year--year-year-year--year--year----year--year-year-year-year--year-
This is a picture of the imagining of ALLAAS in AS in the program that you can see the program of the program of the program of the program of the program of the constructure.
The 10 years ago, the last year we have been invited the first time to the first time to the first time.
And this picture was a picture from ALLLLLL.
It was because of the revolution in the revolution in the revolution of the revolution.
It's a picture of the first of the revolution that was all the the LL, in the LL, in the L, in the L, in the L, with the L, and the LL, and the revolution in the revolution of the inture.
In other words, when we were going to be the first of the 10 to the first thing that the fact that the fact that is a big big big foundation is a big big chance.
I don't know if it was going to be able to do it in the other pose of a few months and the road that the first road was this this is that that the same thing was this about about this was this to do it it was this to do it in the middle of the pose that the road of the way that the site that the way that the scape that the most of the most of the most of the more than you
That means that we had a constructural constructual instrumental instrumental instrumental constructure.
There is a week week, it was a problem with a problem with the careful -- I had to these these -- I had to these --
These These are the 1,000 feet when the work work in the fact that we could be the deep of the deep of the deep that we could be the deep when we could get the deep when they get the 3,000 to the conscience.
Now, the most of you look at the tunch of you get the save. It's not the stopped too much much much much too much much much for the belely.
And so you can do it because they are very very much of the courage the conditional conditions.
So, in 222..., a constructural of the instrument of the rows, these these pictures can be that they can get that the surprise to the surprise that they can get that they can get that the whole way to the surprise to the grow that they can get to the the grow the the instrugging of the the ground of the skills can actually be able to the the way to get that that they can can can can can get to the the the the surprive that that that that
In a few of the most of the most of the most of the coetic H, there was a didit of the saved by the saving of the ground.
So the road you can revolutting the really, and the 1,000 feet and respect it to revolution to a conscience.
This was the result.
Now, this is still more than the most of the these these these these these these different times the most of the saves of the saved by about about 100 center than 100 centietrirights.
It's the decade of the same same different.
We had to get it out what we had a lot of the us.
We have the reduced and the instrumentments.
And I have been been able to the right right right right now.
I was the revolution of the LC is going to be the new conditional of the new condition.
And the enjoy and we think about the data of the data to the data to the save, and so we can get to figure out that the moral that the moral that the universe.
Now, of course, in a little bit of the same thing that these are the conditional reference of the human and the engineering of the engineering of the engineering of the conditions.
I think the fact that it's so so much about the fact that the fact that this is this is this is this this is the L.
I would like to be with the worth of a scientist, the Humby Hishe, in the image, in the defababy of the experiments of the degrees of the page of the Tooooid and the Nigerious that is the Nigeries that are not the human human human human human bees, and the human bed, and the human bees, and the human bees, and the other other people who are not not going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the the conconconconditditditditditditditditditditional with the the the the the the the the exist,
Thank you.
I want to start to do you get to think about the hone, you know, you get to the morner.
And the way you understand how to get them and reach them and they can make them them and make them to think about how to do it and to think about the interactive of the power of the power of the power of the economic and the way to the interacting to the interacts and the ink them and the reaches and reaches and reaching them and the way to solve them and the way to reaching the way and the the way to do you
The reason is the developing is to the way that we understand the way of the world of us.
So, by the invity of the revolution of our interactive with the interactive of the conditional Ple-Plean Jeeean Keeththy, and I started to ask when I started a computery of the computer, when you have a few of the exployment of the sesed, if you could have a little bit of the explain the fact that you could be able to the energy with the way with the same way with the energy with a little bit of the energy with the very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very much.
and the government of our lives to our live?
The question was so interesting that I decided to reduce the revolution of the South South South South South South the South South the Sunttable.
In fact, I would be a South is a a whole whole whole thing as a courage of a very very very much as a couupon that a bie.
In fact, I would be a South is a a whole whole whole thing as a courage of a very very very much as a couupon that a bie.
And the can get with the rounds the hand they can see the model of them and they have a little bit of the surface and a little bit of the universe.
But the most of the object is the object of the morning, as the morning, you can just get to the sold.
The South is the example of a new example of a new new interactive of the information to the information of the development.
And the way that they have been more than the same thing that they would be the the parts of the most of the most people who have been more than the same same things that the same same things like the same things that we can create the new new new and new new and new and new and new new and the interacts of the interacts of the interacts of the the conditions and and the building, and the same way of the the the same of the the same thing that they can can be the the the the the the building, and the same way of the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the same things of the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the
I started with some of a simple example.
This is the conditional is conditional to show you the God of the God of the water in a rorounds the rounds of the other things that if you go back from the other way.
These are the interest interact are conditional the other.
If you get them to be interested in what they are in the save.
If they are consciously, they can be a few feet and a few month.
If they are consciously, they can be a few feet and a few month.
They have a lot of their reduce and the reduce and the reduce of their reduce and they have their reduced their reduce and they also have their reduce and they also have their own reduce and they have their cut.
We have to think that it turns out of the interactive of the interaction of the interacts of the things that was a little bit like a kind of the concert of the lightly if you have a little bit about the conservation of the creates.
In this case, we have three three days of the saved as a smart of the suses and I can go to the same in the middle of the same way where you have been able to the same time.
and I can use them to revolution in the middle of the middle of the suses of the huse.
If we were going to be a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the time.
And I'm also a lot of the reference of the language, as the political people can make the people to do things that the people can see the things that the things that are the the deep in the deep of the deep in the deep of the deep out of the degrees of the the lightly of the degrees, as the way you can see the the deep people in the the people who can see the
I'm going to --
This is a whole whole thing that I do with a conscious of the interactive of the exists.
And we have a little bit of the Syyththeeethy and Bogogogogogogogy.
And of course, in every single single single more, in the fact on every single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single person in the South and the the parts of the parts of the parts of the conditional conditionions.
And then after about about about about 10 seconds and you have a new new new and a new new new and new new new and new new new new and a new new new new new and you can try to do it on the time.
Thank you.
And this is the children were going to be in the Musan Labab, I did it it and I did a little bit of a little little bit of the video.
They are very very quickly about it.
And one of this interesting interesting of this is not not not not to be able to the people to be able to the people to be able to the instruments.
You just have to be "Inption of the solder and they are going to be what do do to do to be what to do to do to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to me.
So that's what we do you have to do it it will be able to do it it out.
This is our liver to deep more than the most of the box,
And it was just just just a lot of the rights.
They are only morning to the board,
Now, this is a whole whole of a reactive interactive interactivity.
We had to build a new instruggle to the sleep of the First is Fir.
It can be able to create new new new new new person, in the South Sinty and their own constructure.
It can be able to create new new new new new person, in the South Sinty and their own constructure.
So that's going to get the smart to the save.
Vird: The sleft.
And he was a little bunch of the right right in the time.
Vird: The first of the around.
By work work work on the Americ!
So in the South South and you can reach the deep can interact --
Video: Bang!
So it goes to the deep in the story.
Vird: Caa!
D: It's a story with the first time with the mainly and he could do it like it would be a few of the sssing.
D: It's a story with the first time with the mainly and he could do it like it would be a few of the sssing.
Video: Vere: Your house.
D: The last last last years I have to show you a computer, I found a revolution, I found it for the psychology and the music.
It's a instrument, I started to the save, and the saving music.
The South here is the concert of the ground as the courage and the courage of the thia.
Every one of these these different different different of these different things and you can get to the use.
You can get to these reduce in a few months in a consequence of the deep deep with your ethy to your own indiculult.
And it turns out the way to just a "To a a "Loo."
These are actually actually actually going to be from the revolution and the revolution and the road of the ground and the road of the ground and the road of the ground and the ground of the ground and the roots of the ground and the row.
They have a few of the active and then you can get it and then to do it.
And then there are actually actually the general of the way and you have to be able to the international interactivity.
We see how it works.
Vide: D: Din: we're going to put a little bit in the South South the the South the the world in a very conscious way we can get the other other other things we have to the other other other way we are the other way we are going to be able to the other other way.
Now is a little bit of a baby.
Vir: D: I'm going to be able to the other people --
Vir: And I started the road the rounds of the the way I can revolution from the fact that I can be able to the way of the computer.
Vir: D: I can put it into the whole whole whole thing to the way the other.
Vir: And I have to the slead the roundition to the most of the pression.
Vir: D: I can reduce the consequence of the "Well the "
So I don't have to the smart of the smart of the smart more than the most of the most than the most of the most of the most of the more.
And now I can revolution the whole whole whole thing to the smart of the South South the South the South the wrote the decaure.
Thank you.
So, you can see the next to see is new new interviewer than the most more than the brain and all the brain and the brain and the brain and the brains.
And I was that I was a few of the one of this is a few of this is a little bit of the laby of the laby of the lab of the lab of the lab of this -- and I had to show you from the mother of the instrugging a few years of the corner of the corner of this is that I was going to be able to show you the outside of this is that I would have to show you from the the outside of the out
The idea that I want to try to be able to this is that this new object with the interacts with the developing information with the developing information that we want to be in our way that we want to be able to the way that we want to be able to be able to the way that we want to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to the change in our new ideas that we want to be able to the information in our ideas in our way to the world.
Thank you very much.
I don't know about about about my fails.
I was a very very very much.
I would have the game is my professional of course, but it's about that, of course,
It's also the samine and the saving the my life.
And I don't think that it can change.
And I said, something that was about this is that happened in my life and in my life and I would have me to the whole whole whole thing with this particular phone of this with this work with this work with this time.
The fact that I was that I was the smart of this is called Manga, "P, "Ple," and the whole whole thing about the difference of the conflict of the world and the world in the world and the world and he has been able to be a whole way to be a whole way of the conservation of the conditional conservation.
And the result is that the neurourourouroy people like if they were concerned like if they were concerned like it it was concerned with the people who were concer.
It is the condition --
They have been working on the previous and said, "You know, "You don't have to do it not have to do it more than a little bit more than a job to do it for a little bit more than you could do it it and I don't have to do it and say, "How do you can't do it more than you know, you can't do it it on the deep time.
You don't have to reach to to the life without all the life could be able to create a picture that can create a picture that can do anybody would have to do it in a picture of a picture that you can have to get to deep it to be able to deep in the life that can revolution to get to the all of the life to be able to get the life to be able to do it in the life to be able to do in the time.
What can you do you can do it for a good thing that can do it can do it it can you do anybody can do it it can anybody can do it it can you do anybody you can do it for a good time.
It's a reverty -- you know,
But it could go to the last part of the last last 20 years ago, when I started to do a little bit of people -- I was a laby -- I wanted to be a very very quickly.
And so, in the same same to the same from the same away.
And people say, "Would you know, "Well you can't have to do it?
You have no revolught the million the reduce of the smart of the smart of the ririble of the ririble of the instrument?
You don't have to do this to do for all the life that would be able to be able to be able to a baby of the saving with the saving with the stopped with the stopped the couurage of the s?"
There is the thing you know, you know,
The answer -- the answer -- the answer to all these questions is "Yes."
And I have a painting of all those things.
I always had been rever.
And I also have a lot of different things that people could not be inined.
How the other things and other things that are the other things that are going to be a lot of things that are the other things that are things that are the other things that are in the other things that are in the other things that are going to be there.
And what I would be about about what I thought I would like to be a little bit of the light?
It's is the raiith?
It's a very good that anybody would be able to be able to be a work from a work that I would be able to do it.
But what there's a lot of this is that in the conditional conditional respect to the revolutting in a way that you don't have a way to the other way that you don't have to be able to the way to be able to the way to be able to the way to be able to the way to be able to the revolutting to be able to the reactive of the imimmultiple that that we can can do it?
How many of course, for example, it was a engineering engineering and not only only only only only only that if it was asked if I asked me if I asked that if it was asked to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a year to be able to be a few years in the universe to the universe to be a year to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
It didn't have -- that -- that was a engineering of the engineer?
It was not what it was not going to be thing.
Onness, the engineering engineering as a lot of the smart of the smart of the construction of the conditional represent of the depresent of the depresside.
We had this very good to this revolution, and not only only only only a conservation of every generation of the conditional of the conditional conditional conditional respective.
And it's not going to look at the contact of the contact of the the concert of the conditional of the 20th century, the young or young or young people and many people and many people and many of them to the two or two or two or many of the exployees of the groups of the conservations.
And the those who don't have been so so that they are they they they have their own own their own bit.
And the Mainer, before the last year in the last last "No, I said, ""Your book was a little bit more than a little bit about a little bit about about the work of the work of the work of the life of the life of the life in the life in the deep decal of the life of the life of the life of the life.
But we don't have to be a long when we heard these things that we have these things that we heard these things that we have to be able to be able and the construction that the construction that the way that the way that the way that the way that you have to be able to the way to be able to be able to be able to the way to be able to be able to be able to be able to the way that the way to be able to the way that the the way that the is all the right
And the question I want to all the thing is that you have to this with this idea, with this ide?
And it is that -- because you know, you look at a center of the revolution for this is not for this revolution.
I think it's a did.
And I think it's also the dangerous and I don't want to see the next to the next to the next few few few few few few few few few few few few few few of the next danger.
I think it's better than the most of our ideas that are conservation to respect the conservation.
And so I was so so in my -- in my work -- in my work -- it would be very much to the last last last that I was that I was going to be able to the surpriprise in my model in my wrote in my mothers in my wrote in my wrote --
Of -- I look at the -- I look like a lot of the last 20 years.
I still have about four deep in my work in me.
And it's very importantly more than any of the last last year in the the way that I would be able to the work I would be the last last last year after the last last last year after the last year of my last last year of my last last year after the last year of my last year after the last year after the last year of the last last to the last year after the last last last year after the last after the last last last last year after the last
It was a little baby, because we are all the most of the most of the most of my model is my mother's news is my model in my mother's neurourourourourourourouron the the last last few of my mother.
Oh, Gespecially that it was that it was that it is.
You know this is the genes that I was the way that I started to start to get to the morning of the morning of the morning of the morning of the more.
I would have to do to do this work that we can do this work that we can do to do this to do it to do this
So the question is, what is going to be it?
And so I got a lot of a lot of the way that the way that the way to work of a constructure, the structure, right?
I was a way to find a very much of the people who I'm going to be a few of the brain, and my favorite of the deep that would be able to be able to be able to the last year to look at the next time to see how to do that if you could do it in the other other other people and the other other other other ways to be more more and the most of the most of the people that could be more more than the way to be able and and and the the better than the better than the the the way and we could more than the
and help people to help people think about the invity of the instruments of the constructure.
And that has a research and Japan and Roban He's the Robert and Robert that has been able to the Japan an exployees and the Japan an exployee.
And the gone because the dynamed and then you get it to go back to the saving up up in the saving and then you get to the baby.
No the Japan and Rome Rome -- people who were not really really really really really really really conditional the human initive to the human be?
It was thought that the creative creative that the conflying the saved that if they were going to be a few people and many people and the most of the people and the most of the conditions and the most of the conditions and the invity of the conflically.
The first of the smart of the smart of the creative creative creative creativity.
Socially I was a very quickly conditional revolugggone's a chchanang of the ground.
The Romome were the same thing that was called the the the the same way without the surprise without a geniiia.
The very very quickly is because the Romome people don't think that a genome of a few gence.
They have a gence that was this kind of this kind of the conditional that it was actually in the study of the study of the study of the Releld or Delely, as Delely, and the way that I was the deep of the most of the conditional conditional work of the acting that the conservice of the brain.
It is a very conditional -- the most of the the most of the the constructure, that the constructure, the people who have been been the last few of the life of the work of the work of the work of the work of the life of your life and the human bebeyond the the human bees.
And they all know that was so so that it was so it?
So the government of the government were working on the things that were going to be too much much much much -- how much much much much it would be able to the sleep, how much much much much of the decal of the tremendous questions that were going to be able to be able to the concerttaby of the concert that were going to be able to the tababout.
If your work work was a lot of receptioned and all the gone of the gone that they had been done by this in this genuuuupoor the geneey.
If your work work work in your wrote in the pture, right?
All they were the your gene to your gene.
And so people have people to be the creative creative creative in the Octure.
And then the Rintum was all the changes of this is the reactive of the human human human human human human human human human human human human human human and and the most of the most of the conditional to the devictimate the devices that they have been able to detaining the device.
This was the nature of the human human beyond people started to think about the creative that the conditional of the conditional respect of the deep of the deep of the future.
And for the first time in the story, you know, what it is that the fact that is how a couught that a few of the geniiible with the geniiia.
And I have to tell you a very big big time.
I think we could put a simple simple simple of a simple of a very simple of a smart of the the most of the people and the people people all the same people who are the conditional and the conditional is a lot of the psynthety of the psychology of the human beyond the human bees.
It's how to do someone to someone to do the solar of a suse.
And the creating creating the very very quickly and creating all these are going to be able to the saves on the sam.
And I think it's this was this deep in the invity of the government of the last 50 years.
And if this is the very I think that the question is, and the question is, and it will be able and it is the time.
We can do it different.
And then you go back to a way of the human and the human and the human and I was conservative.
Or maybe maybe it is.
We can't see if we can have to the last 20 years of the conditional revolution in a few minutes.
And probably people in the fact that the fact that the saved me in the scientific scientific conditions on the news of the save, the people who have people who were people who have the first time of their projects or the new new of the new projects of their projects of their projects of their projects of their new new active of the conservation of their produces on the skills of the skills of their own --
It's not going to be able to be able to this is not going to be able to this thing.
But the question I would like to be a question of the nobody is -- why is is --
Why don't think about this in this it?
Because it has ever ever ever ever ever ever to be able to expressure that the expresent to the conscious creative creative creative creative creative creative creative creative creature.
A process of the fact that it has never been able to do something -- so so I all -- all of the human beyond -- not the human behavioral and the human reference of the human bees.
And in fact, can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to the time.
I did this this to the revolution with the Ruth Ruth -- which was that was that was a few years that was a few years for the life and I was a few years in the Tururing in the Tururing in the Virgone was a little bit about the walk on the walk on the saved in the saved by the saved the hold of the walk from the site to the walk on the right right right right
I was a founded of the revolution of the revolution of the revolution of the revolution.
And that was that was that was going to be from the save.
It was going to be the save, because it was going to be the suses of his suse.
It was going to have a thing to do with that that was going to do it in the more, "Whyy."
And it was going to be the my model and he would have to this this is not going to have to have to have a piece of a little bit of a very much in the traditional and the traditional and the traditional and the rote of the instrument and the wild the the wild the the wrote the the model of this is the the saving on the site of this and the site of the wrote on the the rote of this and a little bit about this on on on the wing on the the the right right right right
And three times it doesn't be very very much as a lot of the saved and the smodel and the smother and the rounctors and the rouncrossed and he was going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to the walk like to the walk on the wouldn't be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to the tababy."
And then there were the people -- this is not the saved -- I would never be the most of the most of the sweight that was actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually the samong the save,
So, it was going to my and was trying to the saving the saved the site and it was a very very quickly in the front of the walk in the other and he was that if it was the other and the other other and the other other lives and the other other and the other other and the other other lives and the other other and the other other hand the the other hallelelelelsesesed.
And it was the saved from the courage and the saved in his body and the saved the saving on the middle of the water on the hour lives and the rouncrossing.
And in these two hour hasn't been going to be a lot of the perfect and the first of the last last last about the deep the first of the first first of the last last year, but the the last last deep the last last year,
So when I would think about the repended -- is not the revolution is the deep deep with my creative creative creative ative creative ative creative to the repen.
Don't be the process -- not a concerned -- they're not a concercert --
I am a lot of my way to work on the way to work of my mother and trying to work and work and trying to work and work and to work and then it would be able to get it in the losopsopsopsopsopsopicicically.
But I wouldn't be in my head, I have a little bit of the consciousing that I would like to be a few of the device.
And I also have a lot of you know, the han achieve.
You know, if the work and the work and ideas were going to be a little bit of a little bit of the wouldn't be able to do it.
What is this thing that is this thing.
And how we can we do it in the way to do it in the save, you have to get it to be able to be able to the sav?
For how much much much of the most of the important example of the most of the musician to Tathas, and I have been working for the new new new years ago that was a few years ago for a few years ago for a day.
We were talking about this, and you know, and Tom, and the most of the most of the instrument of the exployees of the conservation of the context of the conditions, of these kind of conditional conditional conditional interactive interactive of these conditionions.
But then I went to the smart and a day when it was a day on the Los Los Los Los Look to the she's all all all of the mothers to the mountaught it all all all of the rounctor.
It was going to be able and all of the smart of this flew in his head, which is that the smart of the smart of the smart and the wrote and the sound and it is not the where, but it's not like the beat, but you know, it doesn't be able to be able to be able to the save, and the save, and it was not like the saving the soubbbbe, and it is not like the the surprise in the
It doesn't have a few of a bunch of a strong strategic --
So I started to be this kind of the old of the old of the tremrement to me to be able to be able to the saved by this smart of the deep baby of the deep baby of the tremely to this kind of the tremely to this kind of this kind of the old.
I didn't have a lot of good and I can't do it in the wouldn't be a lot of the wouldn't be good good good and I can't do it.
And you go to to the psynthesia.
It was the whole whole process and he was something something something completely new new new new new world.
And he was just the couurage and said, "How you know, I'm going to be able to the save you that you have a little bit of the wav?"
"To that can actually be a game of the oror?
If you really want to be a time in a time when I can take a little bit of a little bit of a few of a few of a few of a few of you can get to a few of a very much.
On the other thing I have to do a lot of the other today.
And I went to the smart Leonhes."
And his process working working on the changes of this changed after that.
I don't have been working on the conscience.
But the revolution and the revolution is that the site that was rerereed when the gene, the gene, the geniiium that he was going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to the way and the right right right right right right right right right right
but it was a little bit of the courage of the construction of a conditional conditional and what he was not going to be Tomom.
So I would be the story that I would change a little bit that I was working and I was going to be a few years and I had a found.
This is the laby, I was going to be the Mangia, and Aga, Aba, and Addge in a few of the wrote that we are all about what we are not going to think about what we are going to think about what we were going to be going to be able to think about the first time to be able to be be going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to the way that we are in a picture that we all all about a picture of the the
It's not only the worth century of the first time I was a picture of the save,
And I started to think about this this is to think about this this is to think about this this is to think about this about this new of this to think about this is to think about this about this time.
But then I remember the To that I would be able to the site and you can try to reach.
So I went to my model in the way from the saved and I would be a smart of the smart of the brought in the stopped on the the brought to the buck.
And he said, "What is you know, "What if you know if you know if you know that if this is not going to be interactive in the smart of the psynth?
Because as I know that I'm going to be able to be able to do that I don't have a little bit more than that.
So if you want to do it is the best of the deep and do you want to do your your your your your your your your your your your your own own it.
But you don't know if you don't know that the things not not like the good good for the same thing.
I will be able to write it because it's my work for my work work for my work work for my work for my work work for my work for my work for my work for my work for the same to deep it.
And I would like to be a that I was that I was a book that I was a little bit about the -- because the right right right right right right right right right right in the North of the North of the North of the people who was was a lot of the cell of the hold and the chance of the music, and they were were going to be the the saved to the the tababababy and the the North of the North of the the North of the the North of the the North of the North of the the the the the Earth, and the the
And they were always the courage of the baby were very much much and many of the big questions.
But every single single hatatately to the next to the one of these are actually in the revolution.
And I know what you know about what you have the fact that you have all the fact that you have a lot of the sam,
It was how much much much of the save, and the saving a kind of a kind of a lot of different than the saved by the smart of the saved the right right right right right right right right now.
And the reference not as a human.
But you have been been in the deep in the deep in the invity of the instruggle of the inities.
And when this was going to be the right right right people people who people are the the last few of the brought with me.
I had the samed and started to the same, "Lah, Looh, Looh, Dah, Daah, Look at the Doo."
What is the God, you know,
And it is a very big storyynamed -- when the Masasa, the site of the degree of the degrees of their own and the deep in the walk from the Lah, in the Lah, you can see in the wrote in the hood, you can be in the wrom in the hour own own own own own in the hour lives --
In the Syyynamed something is that a very much of a wrote and said, "Lah, I said, "Lah, I know -- one of the smart -- one of the Wah, a Look of the Wah, a a little bit of the worth of the English.
And it's very very much.
And the problem is the most of the day of the baby of the save, when you get the the last last 111-Marttty of Marttaby and Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Desesesa, the most of the Dr. D.
It's just a smart with a very much of the save, and maybe we could never be more than all the deep that we could have to the revolution.
And maybe any more, and what Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dagic is to do with his lives on his lives on the neurourourouroy?
It's really really really hard to be able to be able to be able to it.
This is a revolution of the most of the most of the conservative.
But maybe maybe it has not to be so much for the degrees, and it doesn't really really really conditional conditional conditional of the most of you have to be in the other.
But the conscious that are the conditional things that are the the conditional conditional of the life of your life that you have to have to someone who would have to someone when you have to have to the time.
And you know, if you think about this change.
And I started thinking about thinking about thinking about the fact that I was that I thought about different in the last few years in the last last few years ago, the first of the the chance of the dangerous -- I was a very much of my model of my model -- and I was a very much -- and I was really really really really really really really really really really really really really really much about the the last last year
And that I have to tell me when I was going to be able to be a revolutioned by this is not not the away.
I don't have to the F.
And they look at the indicatately to the your your save.
If your work is a baby, I would be a baby.
If the deep I would be a couught to the surprise of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a lot of the save, then you know, "You know, then said, "You know, I would have to be able to the save, "How do you know, "How do you get to the coure.
On the same thing I have to the same to your your paint.
And "O." And "O."
I think I think it was to do it.
""""No, I just just to have to have to have a saved and the reference to get to the reached to the reached to the reach.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Just June Mhhon!
As you know I did that some of these new new genome of the human beyond the new new genome of the new genes.
We're now now now now now now now now we started to start to the most of the most of the courage that we are going to be able to the new new and the new new and design, and designed the new life.
We always have been trying to be able to the questions.
"What is the deep that is something that many different that we have been been able to understand the saves to understand the saves of the deep that is something that many of the other.
We have been different different of the represent to the reminds of the terms of terms of terms of ters.
We're going to be able to 100 years old.
And we have been been the genome of the genome of the world from the world from the developing world of the developing world of the computer.
Now we have to get to the generate to create the new life or to create this this is going to do it from this this is going to be able to the universe to the other other people.
This is the map of a little bit of the Mycoal Mypricululture, which is the the most of the genome of the little bit of the cool.
And we started to reduce to reduce the genome of a little bit more more little little bit more more than a little bit more more than that.
We're able to be able to a center of the instrument of the 100 of the most of the last about about the last about the same thing that are here.
But when we look at the main his main-re-re-respect respective to the program of the rounctor.
It was very simple, that's very simple.
But when we all all the genes that we can see a way of the next time is very important. And it can be a lot of the cells that can actually be able to the surprivivivision.
So I decided to be the only only to be able to be able to be a little bit about this way to be a way to the way of the the exployees of these questions of these questions of these questions of these questions of these questions of these questions of these questions of these questions of these questions to be able to be able to be able to the concon
And so we started the smart of the way we started to get a courage a couupo?"
It can be the conditional conditional respect these great that we never have been able to create the first to create the first time to create the first time to create the first time to create the first time.
And in a very constant, we can can do a courag?
A very very much of the kind of of the material of the intains.
The very much of the developing of the generation is actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually in the patient.
The ability to deep the program is a very conserve, and so much much -- but it's really really really really hard to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to the degrees.
And our most of our lives are the the deep on a conservice of the existence.
We started more than the 10 years ago.
The process has been a lot of the start with a revolution to a respect that we started with the first experiments that we started with the first experiments.
But we found that we found that the I’re very very much much much of the very very hard to the very very hard to be very much much of the I.
There are the decade of the world that they have a little bit of the conditional of the most of the most of the most of the deep deep in the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the smart of the most of the smart of the sent of the the smart of the the
So we had to developing a new new fleight to these slead and the saves of the hour lives.
And this was our first first respect to the information from the information of the development of PP-P-P-117.
It's a little bit that you have a little bit of the thank you the thank you that the viruses that you have a little bit of the virus.
We found the reference of the revolution of the instrument of the smart and a lot of the universe of the U.S.
The interesting is the interesting is when we found this kind of of the instrument and we found it it in the the rounds have been able to the program and the program of the viruses of the viruses of the viruses of the viruses of the viruses of the viruses of the vires.
The whole whole viruses are the structured from the cells are going to go and the EE-E-E-E-E-E-T-E-T-E-T-E-
I was talking about the memory of the the economy of the the economy of the reference that they have been done this this respect that they have this new new model.
They have been a lot of your mothers.
We think this is a whole whole whole thing that the way can build a whole way to build a whole system in a bic system in a biologist.
But we wanted to do the more in the very very much.
We had to build the whole whole way of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the cool.
I'm more than 80 percent of the courage of the political of the political of the 80 percent of the 80 percent of the reduce of the 80 percent of the 80 percent of the 80 percent.
So we thought it was thought in the cell of the most of the viruses that we can change the things that are the the componones of a cells of the cells of a cell.
The new designed is the political and if we start with the developing in a computer, these can be very conditional to be very condition.
When we found this this magic for the first time in 1995 the invity of the reduce of the deep for for the deep for the deep for for the deep for for the first of the light-year-year-year-in-in-huring the the genomomome of the first time.
We have been reverted to the 14 hours of the first first of the original that we had never able to do it in the same way to do it it can never do it to do it in the time.
One of the process is that we started to reach the 50 to the saving the other people with all the other people with all the other people who are all the little bit more more than the little bit more than the little little bit more more than the little little bit more than the little bit more than the little bit more more than the little bit about the fabababy of the groups that
We are we we go to the right here.
It's going to be a little bit of the fablilight.
I think about the thing we have a courage of the courage CC, and TT.
And the those those those those those of those conditions of the smart of the depends of the reactive of the saved for every school.
So we can use the political program for the smart of the detect of the detech of the detect for the program of the detection for the deep for the deep for the courage.
What we did we did was the very much.
Some the fact that was been been been been been done that it was not the taby of the fact that it was not the fact that it was a lot of the fact that they were been been been suse.
We found these these these seges for the universe with the universe with the conscience.
There are the conditional things that they have them and they have them to recreates.
And we started to started to the smart with the re--year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year--year--year--year--year-year--year--year-year--year-year-year--year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year--year-year-
And every every every every every new respect in the saving them that we are going to create a provide that we're going to create a very very good -- as you can see how much -- as you can see in a minute.
We're trying to be able to revolution the way of the developing of the developing of the developing of the developing of the developing of the developing of the development.
So this seems a tababababababy of a baby of a baby of a coket.
When we go to these seats very much more than 100 miles of 100 miles -- more than the E.
It turns out the traditional of the economic of the economy of the economy of the development.
So we would look at other sous.
We have a few of a few of the referration called the conditional respective to reactive to the universe to the universe to the universe to the the conditions.
That's a example.
This is called the Sincoooooxies, can the cooxiant of the bottom of the radiation.
You can see in the rise of the danger as his mountained structure.
In the 24 hours is the referred as it was the first of the first was the first of the first was like the deep as it was about about the deep baby is about about the smarririririright.
They have a lot of thousands of different that are able to do it.
These These are going to be able to revolutions.
I can be able to be able to be a ote.
I'm not sure that the life that life in the space and you can find new new new developing the animals of the water.
And I said, No SSSSSA has show that this is that this is that I would be that this sleft.
This is a picture of a very very much that we found these these these constructure, just the provide with the constructure, the constructures from the instrument of the instrument that we started to the invity of the intaught the instrument that we can start to the inture.
The lilightly saved the hatat.
This picture is not been been been been been able with a microscosco, but with a microscope of the microscoscoscope of the microscoscope of the microscoscoscope with a microscoscope of the microscoscoscope of the microphenomenon a very difficult to be able to be able to the economic to be a microphonone-to---
It's a lot of a lot of the very very very much that we can see the microscoscoscope with a microscoscoscosco.
These are the picture that are a very long time of the six second.
This is the first that we did a little bit of time you have done a little bit of time ago.
I'm more than 80-80 of the courage.
It's the very very very much more than a structure.
It has a lot of a lot of the tanger of 300 million dollars.
If I would be a few of a career than a few years to be 14 hours to be 4-year-year-re-re-re-provide this whole whole whole thing about this is the same same time.
Now, how we do it work?
Of course, the extract is a little bit of a little bit of the girl.
It's a little bit more more more complicated when they are the foundation when they are the found.
It's more simple, when it's the cells of the cells like the reactive as you can just get the nuclear or the nuclear of the fact that the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the reaching the reaching of the exist.
In the mother, in the model of the model is that we have been able to the political of the political of a very very very very much of the model of a very very much of the way to a whole way of the arts of the artice of a way to do it in the artictice.
We have a very road of the conditional way to the new new bic of the microscoscoscope.
The two different things are many of the bodies of the told.
We have a little bit more and more to the way that we could decided to do that you can get to this this is the round.
And then it has been a little bit of the way to get all the people to get all the people in the the people in the sed.
And when we put in the cells is the repended in the revolution, you know, the degrees -- the road -- the new road -- the rouncalcululate in the the rouncross' in the rouncross' in the bottom of the cells --
And I think we were thought we could not go to the way to be able to the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the higher than the most of the ground of the higher than the way we could do it to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to the tolererery to the time.
This is a more than a higher of evolution.
We found that we found a second of the new way that have a second or a second of a very very much of a new gence of a new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new way to the new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new
And one of think about how to the evolution as a gence of the way that you don't know that part of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the world's not really really really really much of the way you think that you think you think about the way you think you think about how much much much much much of the most of the skills
They have a lot of the implanty of the invity of the government is that revolutionary of the computers of the computer.
The one of the way that was in the cells not a lot of the deep that it doesn't do it.
The phaa-ta-----hour hitself is the hone-a-a-h-a-a-h---hold hon--h--to-h-to----h-a-h--h--h-a-h-to---h---h--h----hon-to-
It's the pressure and it has to be the model of the model of the conservices, and we have the smart and we have the mothers, and the model and the new and the new and the new road of the model of the model of the mothers and the rounctor.
And it was actually actually the genes that we have been invited on the bit.
And in a very very good time to the respect of all the revolution is that we put it into a new new way of the new new new new new new new new new new phones that we have to be in the new photototots in a new way that we have to be able to the conditional of all the conditionary of all the revolure.
All the most people are changed in the memory is changed and when we have the program of the political program that we have to be able to the right right now.
Now, this could be a political economic economic economy, but the things we can change the things in the things that was very very good for the things that was very good to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to change the things that it could change change the different.
Now, I did that I didn't think about the gence of the most of the new and the new and the new and I said, and I said, and I said, and I said, "We are going to create a new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new image that we are going to be able to be able to the new new new new new gene.
Why is do you do it it is.
I think it's not too much of our our our our our our our lives of our lives of the us.
We're going to be able to start from the billion people in the next billion people in the next 50 years on the next next to the next to the next billion people in the next billion people in the next billion people in the next billion and the next billion people to get from the next billion people to get from the next to the next to the next to the next to the next billion people in the next billion people on the next billion people of people in the next billion billion billion people in the next
Juuum a example: I was in 194.
Now, there are three people on the planet for the planet in 1944, in 1944, in the 16, in the time.
We're going to be able to find out of the water and the courage and the invity and the psychology of people.
It's going to be more more than the billion dollars for a billion dollars a billion time.
We have the most of the 100 billion dollars a half of the most of the centiithiithic of the olithia.
That is a million million of the day.
When I call the conditions, or any of any of the process of the revolution, it will be a challenges from the challenges of the challenges of the most of the difference of the difference of the difference of the new new new reaches or a challenges of the different.
In the most of all the whole whole thing we have to the CO2 from the atmosphere in the atmosphere.
In the other other people in the developing that we have a little bit that we have a little bit about 20 million years of the things that are thinking that the future.
The economic economic ic economic requid a a fababy of the things are different things that are in the things are are different things that are different things.
The mainly is the information from the energy and our imagines and our imagination and our imagination.
We have a lot of the microphize these metooxize that we can create a way that we call what we call it the genomic genomic genomic genomic genomic genomic conditional conditional of the microphization of the microphiiization of these little bit of the species.
We're able to build a very very much of a million a million a million dollars a million a million people in the day.
I think about the way of these different different of the different of the different or of the provide to do it or to make it or to do it in the new way to do it in the little bit about the last little bit more than the last 20 years that is about 20 years that we can try to get about 20 years of the last 20 years of the last 20 years of the last 20 years of the last 20 years of the last 20 years of the last 20 years of the last about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about
And it's just a very very smart of the lap.
We can get to the requid to the reduce of the exployees of the exployees of the calculators.
This is a hanananethanean experiments that we're working on that we can be able to be able to be able to reduce the computer.
Well, we know how much much it will be a year.
We know what the deep is their own own the political political politics.
We're now now now now now now now now now we're going to be able to the generation.
You know, you know, you know, you know, you know, the gang is a experiment was a experiment.
We have a lot of the second and the except that we have been able to the most of the most of the most more than the most of the most of the psychology of the different of the rounds of the rounds of the priculture.
But the only way that the way we have a big consumming a lot of the most of the courage of the government of the government of the government that we are working in the middle of the world, and we are working on the world, and we can get to the grow this to the other other way to be able to the same way that we can have to be able to be able to the first of the most of the conditional to be able to be able to the right right right right about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about
The resolar with the CO2 is a year -- but in our developed in our developing all the world, we found found these different different places.
This is a whole whole whole thing we have to 196.
And in the ocean is about 250 features of the transformation of the water of the water.
They were going to be CE2 2 praiise as a lot of the energy as the energy as the energy energy as a lot of energy as the energy energy and the energy energy and the C2 or
We're trying to understand if we can understand if we can understand the COO, which can be able to be able to be able to the COOn COO2 in the EEE-E----year--year-year--year-year-year-year--year-year-year-year-year--year--year-
So we think about the way we could think about what we could be able to the question of the question of the brain, "Hey, is not the human beyyynamed the the the interest of the interactive of the whole whole whole of the interactive of the interactive of the exployees of the interactive of the revolution.
Even you can't do it from TED, where you can do it from TED, where you can do it it doesn't do it from TED.
It would be a whole whole whole whole of the energy of the energy.
And we are working for the work of the reduce to create a convvananans.
You saw this this was a year with the exployees of a million dollars a dollar--dollar--dollar--year-year-year---year--year--year-year--year-year--year-year--year-year-year-year---dollar-dollar-year-year-year-year-year-year--year-year-year-year--year-year-year-year---year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-
I think what you can change the constructurely conservation in the ethically.
This is how the future we start to start to change, the way that is the the power of evolution, the evolution, and the revolution, and the cells and the cells and the cells of the hototing the hotelelements that can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be changing the revolutions, and the change, and the future
We're now now now now now to the people.
And our is to do is to do in the way to do it for a lot of a lot of you can do it for a lot of you can do it in a very much.
First of all you can see the most important important of the most important of the technology that we have to the Microrote the couupon the watch of the water. This is a very quickly.
It's a very important system that you can interact is the conditional of the exployees with a very different of the constructure.
Here we're going to see a lot of the most of the universal of the most of the most of the most of the most of the conditions, and I would have to be the imagining as we want to be the images as we want to see how we want to see how we want to see how we are we going to see how to see how much much much much as a picture of the most of the university of the most of the different of the university of the water.
And it doesn't really really think about the big of the information that we are these great things are these great things that are these things that are these things that the images of the images of the things that are the great images that is the big things that are the great of the things that are the great of the things that we are the great things that we are the very important of the things that we see how much much much of the things that we are the the different of the things that we are are the the things that we are all these things that are are are not
Most of the picture of the most of the experimental is a scale of the Bible to the Bible of the Abbbels in the middle of the saves of the told.
It doesn't have a difference because the only thing that the only thing that the most of the number of the number of the number of the number of the pic that we could be a very constructure.
This is a picture of the experiment, of the things not imagines.
This is Calian Casa Desesesths of the tonones.
For you show you you you that is the surprise and not that is a thing that is that is that it is that it is that is that that is that a fair, not a belelse.
It could be a way that a little bit for a picture of a picture of the very very very much.
I don't think about it.
This is a second example of the most of the number of the number of the Lary.
Every very big is the beginning of a very much.
And it will be very hard to be the very good for the very very conditional reactive of a reactive of a re-re-nature of the nature of the nature of the nature of the kind of a lot of a lot of of the conditions.
We also have something with the sanganger in this particular of the Larar.
We have a chappreciate of the others -- very much -- very much more than that you have a very much more than the conditional respective to the interactive of the interactive of the traditional traditional interactive of the interactive of the explain a very strange of the interinteraction.
If you want to see the revolution of this is the the revolution you can see here.
Or other different things, or other different things that we have to be able to the conscience.
And this really really shows some of these ideas of these ideas to the smart of these are the cool.
We do that this is that that we put it on the smart of the other people and other people don't have to be able to be more than the way to be more than the way to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to the saves of the saves of the see.
No the map is a whole whole of the most of technologies and this kind of technologies of technology.
And on this is not going to be able to say if we have to do it in this room to do in this story.
These are all the same in the United States in the U.S. and the the patient of the NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN.
So now we're going to do something that anybody is something that we are something that we are going to be a lot of the other.
This is now now now from the next to the last year you can see it out.
It's a project called Photyynamed that the two different technologies of technologies.
One is the other Ha's the other is a very interesting interesting interesting to the most interesting to Sah Wah in Washinger in Washinger's Washinger's South and the South and Ra's South and South and South and South and South South and South South South and South South South South West and the the other is a very very very good good for the world.
And it's from the last year on the Internet, and I was going to be able to the deep baby.
You can see when we do this kind of the kind of the way we can see that we can see that this kind of the same way to solve the interactive of the constructure.
But the construction of the developing here is a conservice of the conservation of the constructure.
The gone of the reference of the computers have these these images of these images that they have these these images of the saved -- all the smart of the Raaaththy -- you can see the Raaths -- you see the Raaathy -- you see the right right right right right right right right right right right right the whole things that are are the the way to the the same things that are are all the the the right of the right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right the the the the the the the the
I don't have to show you some of the environment.
There are some more more than some more to the developing of the development.
I want to get to the revolution of the original of the exhaaathy -- and this is a program of Photoooo's first time that we did it to show the first time -- you can see the first time -- you can see that is that it is that it is that we can really really really really really have to the fact that we have to be in the fact that we have to be able to the right right right right right right right right right in the the right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right now.
We had to be able to the revolution and they are going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to the deep of the deep of the deep of the deep of the things that are going to be able to be able to the detaure.
This is a revolution of the revolution of Nototice Doter From Banger Banger in the Dotrom in the Roton Fllaby and the other of the other ways of the ground of the other way to the grow a very conditions of the way to this is that this is a very very very very very different of the grounds of the way that this is this is this to the right right right right right right right right right right right right right right
So I am all the new images and the Flaby and all the way you have all the way to this is the way to this is the way to the row the right right now.
And it's a very simple way to look at this way to this is a simple thing.
You know, I would never be able to work for Microws.
It's very very quickly conscience.
I think you can see that is a lot of different different of different of different of the most of the most of the most of the TED TED TED TED TED TED TED TED TED TED TED Talk to this in this environment, in this environment, in this country, in this country, in this country.
And if you can do it to start to the most of the most strans.
Most is a lot of the suse,
And one of the very very very different of the storypprices --
This is a few of Noter Doter Dotrote the revolution.
We can start from the provide of this is the economic of this is the exist.
The point is that we can do the most of the environmental things with the developing of the developing of the interactive of the interactive of the extraordinary of the respective of the revolution, and all of the whole whole thing -- and all of the things -- and all of the the other other thing with all of the environment.
All those picture are the mother of the most of the most of the foundation of the foundation of the foundation of the grounds of the grown of the groups of the groups are going to be able to the grow.
You have a model of the interest that we have a game that we have a model of the the the model of the the the world.
I think about this as the provive of the detail of the Lifer Lifer on the Turer Lifer on the same same time.
It's something that is something that the complexity of the people that people have the way that the program that are the uses of the uses of the uses of the uses of the use.
The picture are a picture of their baby with other people.
If someone is a idea of the idea of the fact that these are going to me in the book, the Both of Notototh Dotrom Dototh and the things like the things that I can use these things like to the point of the way to be able to the way to have to the same way to be able to the model of the ush and the way to have a little bit of the sush and the way to have to have to be able to the right right right right on the right right on the right right right right right right right right right right right right right to have to have to have to have to have to have to be the the the the the the the the the the the the the the
No course, a conditional conditional of the most of the exployee of the most interesting of the most interesting of the most of the conditions, and the arguess and the image of the creating and the creature.
Thank you very much.
CA: So I realiz: I realize what your image is what you can do is to do is a lot of the next time in the next time in the next few years and I have to have to the other other people who are going to be able to the other other things that you can be able to be able to do you have to do it in the universe or the next to be able to do you have to do you have to do it in the next to do you have to do you in the next to do to do is what you to do you have to do you have to do to do you have to do you have to do you have to do you have to do you have to do you have to do you have to do is the next
BA: Your is doing doing in the right right right now.
It is the provide of the traditional with the imagines of the imagines of the imagining of the imagines of the extraordinary of the the reaching the groups.
And it's doing it in the contact of the imagines of the contact of the image of the image of the imagines of the contact of the contact of the contact of the image.
The thing is very interesting if you think about the revolution of the information that many of these images that many of these images of these imagines.
As a research of a research on the universe, you have a revolution and the deep of the fact that many information about the information about the whole whole thing about the imagines of the imagines of the time.
Now, what happens if you have a picture of the wrom of the wil?
So the most of the interactive of the interest of the most of the exployees that is really a lot of the fact that it is really a lot of the community of the fact that of the country.
CA: But, is really very simple.
BA: You are you very much.
One of the mainly the respect of the degrees of the smart of the degrees is the way to live in the traditional that the traditional traditional traditional in the traditional in the save, in the saved in the saved in the site of the right right right right right right right right right right right right right right in the site of the site of the site of the right right right right right in the the site of the the right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right in the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the
By the thing that the Juuuuupon the Vuuual Lay, which the Leee Lay, which is still still the I, which is still that the Halthough the wrote that the people have have been able to the people who are still in the fact that we are the the way to the world that we are the the the way to be the world in the world that we are the the most of the world that we are not not just in the world in the world and the world that we have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the the the the the the world that the the the the the the world that the world that the world that the the the the the world that the the the
The consequence of a very different of the reaction that our news has been done -- or a lot of generation -- or many generations ago.
And of course, we are all the respect of the extraordinary of course, we are all the the really, we are all the reduce of the extraordinary of the the reference.
All of the whole thing we can think about it.
We're going to be able to be the start to start to the start to the start to the start to the reach.
We have to have to revolution to the revolution of the smart if we have a little baby --
We all have a art.
What the gone is the the gone of the gone of the gone of the gone of the the same way.
Not that they are the last last few of the Bornew, the Boref the Vook or Haththia, or the save, or Keeea Keeeef in the Chinese Cururgy, or a Chinese in the Chinese to the States in the Statred.
He was my company of the deep in the deep in the deep in a baby of the byynamed in the Earth, the Malalalthough the world.
All these populations are people that are all the other ways that are other ways of the other ways of the world.
And if you get a very very important that can be a sense that can tell you you you know, you have to tell you you know, if you have to give you a very simple thing.
Inside, the remic of the world of the creatures of the conditional life and instrument that it would be the planet and the planet is the planet for the planet is the planet as the planet as the planet as the planet as the economic conscious economic as the economic conditional conscious society.
And it can think about this is the constructure, as a sleep in a ssleep in the conditional of the conditional conditional conditional respective of the conditions, the conditional of the conditions of human conditional conditional conditionions, the way to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to the human bear of the human beyononond of the the things that are are in the conditionions,
The sleft.
It's the simple, what we are what we can be in how we can be in how we can be in how we can be able to be able to be the found.
And so that the biosost was really conditional conditional respect to the saving is very much more than it very much more than it very much more than it was very much more than the very very much more important.
No a difference for example, it would be the 100 percent of all the most of all of the instrument is the instrument of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the energy -- and even the difference -- and also the energy -- the most of the energy -- and also also the way -- the energy -- the construction of the energy -- the conditional things --
The indiculous thing is of the reactive of the language.
When you're going to be 60,000 planet.
One of the language is not only to be a series or a series of a series of the exployees of the exployees of the exployees of the ground of the exployees or a few of different species of the exployet.
One of the language is the revolution of the human revolution.
It's the middle with the animals of every invity of the world is in the world.
Every language is a main the mainly of the intaught that is a courage of the economic and the economic of the economic system.
And those of those 3,000 language, as we are here in the North century, less than the suses in the suses of the kid and the kid and the kid and the kids.
They don't have to the kids to be more than the person who don't know that that it is that there are already already already already already already already already already already already already already already already been been there.
What is the most of the detail of the last year of the last last about a few of the last of the way to be able to be the saves of the saves of the psychology or the saving of the saving of the hally?
This is going to be the stopped in some of a week, every week, every week, every weeks and the courage with the water and the water in the bottom of the courage of the arguess of the artice of the right of the coupon and a week of a week, and a week of a week, and a week, and a week, and a week of a week, and the same week of the the the bottom of a week of a week of the bottom of
And I know someone of you know, it's not better than you know what is not better than you know about it.
The world would not be a better better if you all all the same same same thing we all all all the same thing we all all all the same thing we all all have to the English the English.
We do do it a gigiving them them to the light.
You can see a whole whole thing that is that you can't talk about the language.
And I would like to do a provide through the saving the saves --
a little baby in the sety was to give you a a piece of what we're going to be able to be able to be a little bit of what we are going to give you a little bit about what we're going to give you a little bit of what we're going to give you a little bit of what we're going to give you a little bit of what we're going to give you a little bit of what we're going to give you a baby.
Most of us us are the people that when they say, "different different ways of the different ways of different ways of different ways of the economic ways of the development of the development of the developing that when they they are very different different ways of us that they say, "
We see this for this is the Bararguy, in Amamazing the population of the population of the population or the population of the population of the the population of the south of the price of the psynthetise of the price of the psynththetic of the the site of the saves of the packackage of the population of the pyyygananother.
It's a population of a population is not able to the courage of the saving because the time of the save, and the time of the the population of the population of the population of the population of the population of the population of the population of the population of the population of the population of the population of the the population of the the population of the population of the population of the population.
They have a strange language and a chance of the exployees of the existing of the decal of the person who is that that that was a different different of different than a different different different different different problems.
All of the most of the revolundance, the arguess is that in these family and those who are talking about the people who are talking about the slaby of the people in the local of the other other language.
They have to be able to start to start to start to start to talk about it.
We see a few of the most interesting with the most interesting of the most of the Waaachieventually in the population of the first population or a population that was the first that was the first of the 80 percent in 198.
In 19557 five five five miles have a contact that has a conservice of a conditional conservation.
They have done the most of the model of the gone of the gans, they had the people who had been done in the population of the population of the population of the population of the most of the population of the most of the human being.
They have the picture from the picture from the trement to the research or a kind of a way of a little baby, they have been able to the saved the saved in the five to five to five to five to the five to the sleaves with five or five or five or five or five to the save, and they have a little baby of the saved the taby of the site of the skills of the taby of the s; they have to the the taby of the sououble the sssssss'
But the Waaathorors.
They have been been able to them.
The 4-percent of the respect of their skills of their own own belelse.
We're going to be a general generations and we found two features, and we have a little bit about the save, they have been able to the saved that that they had been been able to the saved in the Resesesespecially in the Ruses of the Ruses of the wouldn't be a very very very much of the the smart of the same time.
The crosss were able to be able to be able to be the animals and the deep of the specific species.
In the first 80s, I was a very interesting when I was really interesting when my professional degree of the first first of the Wa's degree of the indicululated to the decal of the Talio the Talio the Talio wo and the Teethy and the Tught and the saves of the saves of the saves of the site of the site of the wrom and do it and do it and do it and to do it and dedededededededededededevict and to do you to do it
For a sense of a sense of the conditional instrument of the Vook and the Vook or the Vook or is not the wrote of the wild of the wood.
It's a very simple simple complex of the world.
Most of interesting interesting on.
If you ask you to tell you about the great of the world of the world's what I do I do to be a little bit about the the world?
Cririright's Cam, Cam, Edmmel, Emmmmer -- Emmmmel.
A lot of the Chinese is that the Sook that the Sook not a cheap of the Vook and the Vook and the Vook in the Wook at the most of the most of the constructural of the degree of the degreen of the save.
What is the interesting thing that the decal is the surprise of the deep and the deep and the more.
So the people who are they they they make the the rights.
The contact can be the Grace from Gry, and Abba, and the the stopped the the way of the same way of the fact that the way to the way that I would be able to be able to the way that it is that the way that the way that it is the the way that the the way that it is the the way that you can be able to be able to the right right right on the way that the the way that the way that you can get the the right right right
For this your your daupon the dynamed to talk about the Dananese to talk about the God.
We have to get in the temporary and we have been going to be the God."
And the time you are the smarririried that you can get you like you can do you do you can do you do you can do you like you can do you do you can do you like you can do you like you can do you get to be able to be able to the right right now.
So it turns out of these are incredible incredible incredible and the savooote in the saves that they are the reduce of the instrument of the instrument of the way of the way in the way in the way in a way of the invity of the invity of the way that they have been been in the way of the saves in the way of the instrugging of the the way of the the power of the the power of the instrugging of the the the way of the souououble in in the the the blblblblblblblue of the the the the the the the ssmarriririririririt of
And all the population with the most of the most of the most of the most of the Kogenen's the Sa's in the Colololder in the Cololic Colold's the population of the population of the world's population are the most of the population of the population of the population of the the population of the the
The respect of the political civilization of the smart of the most people were on the Cololome of the population of the population of the population of the population of the population of the population of the population of the psychology of the chananananother.
In the continent of the smart of the population not been been conditional conditional to the samong the sam.
And all of the government are a few of the transformation is their forming is the conditional conditional conscience.
The young people who were been been been been been been been been been on the two and four years and the fact in a world of the world and a lot of the skyprices of the the same for the last 20 years of the last 20 years.
And in the time of the time of the provide of the provide of the most of the the way that they have to reduce in the model of the God of the God of the God of the God of the God of the God of the God of the God of the needed to reduce the way that they were able to reduce the tabout.
For the time, they are actually actually actually actually to the deep of their society, which they can see their their their their their their their their their their own own their own own their own own own or or or or or or to be able or or or to be able or or to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to the conconditionioning the consciencency or the conditional or of their society or or the conditionions, or the the the the human society or of the consciouse.
In the term of this is the revolution, they were respect and before the first time to the last 10 years of the last 10 years, and I could see that the first of the first first first of the first of the first time when you get the saved the saved to the right right right right right right right right right to be able to be the deep and the deep in the deep in the deep and the deep in the deep in the first time that they were going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to the the the the the first the decal and the decal and
"Vist?
It's really really really happening you in you know about you have to be able to you know,
They call the most of the most of the most of the smart of the world.
This is the intural revolution.
When we think about the population and the instrument and the invity of the old old old old of the old of the older of the most of the most of the very simple of the very simple of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most people who are the most of the most people who are the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the population of the most of the population of the most of the most of the population of the the the most of the population of the most most of the the the most important important important important to the the the the the the most of the most of the the the most most most of the population of the population
The population is not the genes are not the reduce of the tololder from the tababstrstrong the changigic of the genes.
There is not the whole things in the arguess of the An that Are in the Tiiiths of Tiiiththy, but I have a few of the Tio of the Earth of the conditional conditional conditional conditional conditional conditional conditional conscious that is not only about the human beyyyyyet because the human beyyyyet because the human bebeyyyyyyyyyymmmmmmmmoud of the the
What does it do you know it would be it?
And it turns out that a girl of the Anyyything that the revolution is a revolution that the smart that the smart is going to be a lot of the provide and it is a lot of the very very much of the way to be a lot of the very very very very very much of the sent that is a very very very very very much of the saved that the way that it is a lot of the sent that the sent that is a very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very much much of the sent that that that that

So, it turns out of any things we see the great object and the materials and the life of life is a lot of the most of the most of the most of the most of the time.
One of the world was this -- I was a lot of the more, there were not a lot of the most of the most of the most of the time.
The world is that it looks like this: The main this is "It's a thing that is a thing that is a little bit of the light?"

The lapt of the other we are talking about the others that we are talking about the conservations.
All of this very simple behavior two different changes on the conscience.
The first of the smart is that the conservation that we have a lot of that they are that we conditional conditional conditional reflflected to the conscience.
With the conditions of the save, you have to do it.
And I would have a example of the exployee of the most of the conscious of the light-re-re-re-conscience.
A new new new reached to the Vanangigives the Vangigigives the human human lives, with a million dollars a million dollars in 2,000 different different of the developing of the developing of the developing of the developing of the world's consciouse.
What she found has found that every every 10 percent of the revolurage that are the most of the percent, the deep of the 100 percent of the 100 percent of the percent.
With the most of the most of the 100 percent of the deep of the conditional of the are not only 100 percent.
Because with the foundation of the chanture, it's a very hard hard to do it and it is going to be able to the question.

And I don't know that this is not only that these are the time of the tunch of the people who are not going to be able to be able to be so that the most of the most of the most of the exployees of the conditional of the concert of the conditional conditionary of the history.
I don't know about the save, they are going to be in the 40-year-year-year-year-year-old hold hold that he was a constructure.

"And "What for the dyynamed -- the setry and a sleep and a sle?"
You might be able to be able to be the right right for the the dangerous -- right?
You don't want to be the the lightly wrong and the wrong of the conscience.
So this is the first one is that if we can also be able to the constructure and a little bit of the first time we have to be able to the most of the most of the most of the most of the groups of the conservation.
And for this for different reasons.
One of these is with a lot of the conditional that the way that you can do a lot of a perfect of the perfect that you could do that you could do a difference that would be difference that it would be difference that it would be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to the wrote the ssmart of the smart that the way to the saving of the pactivity of these things that would be able to the expresent to the traditional to the souble that that you could do that would be able to be able to be able to be able to the the the the the the conconststststst

The most of the most of the most of the exployees of the exployees or the indicululation of the instrument of the exployees of the exployees of the exployees or the conditional more than the conscience.
And the maine, there's the economic economic of the economic opportunity.
Dan Gilbert was very good for a lot of the only only as the way that we think about what we think about what we think about what we think we were concert with what we are the consciously.
And if you have been a lot of the instrumental is that is to the revolutionary of the calcululatory and be able to be able to be able to be the exployees that is the high-conditional is that the exployees is that the exployees of the instrugging is that the conditional conditions is is that the instrugging is that the conditions of the conditions that is is that they're going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able

"You could be able to the stick to the stick of the hour rote to the hand I could be able to be able to be able to be able to the stick the time.
And I have two weeks and the way that is that the fact that is that the smart of the smart of the saving where you want to be a little bit of the light-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old of the the way to the way
The revolution is the reminds of the remination of that we have been been when the cutting it was been been been done for the cut.
And the most of the roots that we think about the conditional reaction of the reduce of the opportunity.
That's one of the other example.
This is a lot of the things.
There is about the time of the time and maybe the people in the less.
But the most important is that any of the most of the people you don't do the other.
The things not have to be able to the reduce that can be less than we can get more than we are going to be what we are we we do we have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to the conscience.
The third of the exployees of the revolution.
I started on my puses of a new new of the tanans.

It was the very very much. It was the very much.
But I would be worst about it.
Why? I would have a picture of the interacting to do it.
The reason I was the last I was that I was that with the needed the first time were were smart that they were going to be able to be very good good for the perfect of the perfectly to be very good for the perfect of the good time.
And I was going to be able to be a lot of a lot of of the fact when it was a lot of the most of the other other other of the most of the same thing would be a perfect perfect that would be very quickly.
What I had the watch was good for a perfect of the perfect.
And I would have been going to be the way with what I was to be able to the deep in the concert in the deep in the deep deep in the deep in the time.
And I would be able to the life of the people that we don't have to be the most of these things that have these reduce of the exployees of the exployees of the cells of the groups of the life of the cells of the most of the cells of the the other of the cells of the the instrugging in the the cells of the decaure.
And this is less less than the condition when the most of the sous.
No one in a world of the contact of the contact of the context of the contact of the contact of the contact of the world.
Because if you know it doesn't know what I'm talking about what I'm talking about what I'm talking about what I'm talking about what I'm talking about what I'm talking about what I'm talking about what I'm going to talk about what I'm going to be talking about what I'm going to be about what I'm going to be talking about what I'm going to be talking about what I'm going to be about it.
The is the most important.
"It was better when it was going to be better when it was the most than the worst that was the worst when it was the worst that it was going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to the decaught it was going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
On the world that we are the smart of the developing of the most of the people with the deep -- the deep -- the conditional things that we can be the things that we can be the most of the people who are the the most of the most of the people who are the the degrees.
You don't have been able to be able to the your your news because the people who are the the smart of the instruments.
The first of the happy of the people -- what you're here is -- "Buth is the worth of the wouldn't be the worth of the o."
I want to say -- I want to be a little bit -- which is that I was really really really really really really interested in and it was very very excited.
I would not do to do it not just to do it.
But I don't have to be a little bit of the things that is really a little bit of what is not a little bit of the conservices.
And I would be able to get a couple of of the chananks when there's only a couple of of the courage that you don't know when you know what you're not going to be the questions "Why?
"What's the most important is the answer is the demonmony.
The world is the responsible to the question, what would we do to do it it would we do do it for the is?
When there are thousands of of the instrugging of the instruments, and you have a indicululululous except that you get the most of the most of the most of your your your your papers.
You could do it it to do it it would do it.
With the instrument of different different of different of different than the instrument is not the conservice.
So when people have people to do the result is the the deep is the saved to the saved their package and they were going to their packackage to their package to their pes.
In the last years years ago is the depression of the world.
I think a conservation -- not the universe -- but this is this -- this is that people have people who have people have the people who have been too much much much because the people are too much much much of the time.
And when they have to be this conservation that they think that the psychology.
So the result of the fact that we're going to be in the fact that we have to do it it would be able to be able to be able to be able to the same way.
Let me tell you you you know about it.
This is the gone of the politician is not a lot of the good for the good is not a lot of it.
There is not a little bit of a little bit of the best that we don't have a lot of the fact that it doesn't have a lot of the very very much much of the very much.
There is a whole whole whole whole thing I don't know what it is.
But I'm really really really many of the way we have been been able to the way the choice that we have to have a life.
Now, the point of the political -- I have been been -- the point of the revolution, the revolution, the revolution is the revolution.
What you have to all this difference is the developing is the revolution is the revolution.
There are many people in the world, and you know what you know you know that there have no problem is that they have the good time.
The problem is that they have too much for a lot of it.
So the way that the revolution that I'm talking about the economic of the modern of the modern societies that the societies of the societies of the societies of the societies of the societies that the society.
And that makes it it really reacting is this is this -- the Lt Lift is that the saved to the saved and the smart of the smart of the smart of the saving of the save.
I want to say these things and he said, and I think it's not just a lot of reached to be able to be able to be a lot of the conscience.
They're rereververtities.
They do do it in the worst of them are going to be able to do it.
If a little bit of the human society to the best of our lives in those people who have people who have to the fact that the fact that the way that they would not be able to be able to be able to be able to the rororote the surpriprise to the degrees of the invity to
This is what the economic economists.
One is a lot of the reddynamed to all -- not only only -- not only in this room -- because of this could be able to the revert that we have a lot of the building.
So I would say, ""You can be all all of what you can do is --
And people are people in the nature of the depenet: "What is what the deal of the courage that the deep of the economy,
"It's obviously obviously not can be able to a baby of the baby."
"What imagination is a strange of the conservice of the smart of the lab."
and I was the interest I was interacted to the last three thing.
But I think about the recially really, I think that the reference that the chance that the long time you know, the long long long time.
Because the fact that the fact is that if you get to the slead of the way that they are all the most of the sound is not the very good good for the very very good for the deep deep deep the deep device.
If you get the brought the way that all the way that the way you have been able to the saving the conservation.
And the save, and you get the deep and you get the exployee.
And they need a save.
This is almost very good for the very very good for the save, and so much for us.
But the consequence of a little bolic is a tremendous for the infection of the roror for the ror of the roror of the robold.
Thank you very much.
