The year I've been <unk> these <unk> for <unk> <unk>, which <unk> <unk> <unk>, which is <unk> million years of the United States has been <unk> to <unk>, <unk> percent of the <unk>, <unk> percent of the <unk>, <unk> percent of the <unk>.
<unk> this <unk> is because of the problem because it's not because it's not <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> is, in a sense, the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> system.
It's <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
The next next will be a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> are <unk> in the <unk>.
How you see, you're <unk> to the <unk>.
That's the <unk> in <unk>, which <unk> <unk> <unk>.
You can see the <unk> <unk>, of five or more or more, is how the <unk> <unk> here, which here here here, which here is here,
And in the <unk> years is to so, so.
This is a problem because the <unk> of the <unk> of the ocean where there are <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk>
<unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> from <unk>, that would be <unk>, which is not <unk>.
And in some <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>! <unk>: <unk> <unk> is good. The question is, if we <unk> us.
It's why this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This is a <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> never never <unk> to <unk>.
This is the <unk> <unk>, in <unk> <unk>.
If you want to know how you you want to get to <unk>, <unk>, here is where the <unk> <unk>.
These are <unk> <unk>.
<unk> other other other planet: <unk>, <unk>, the most <unk> of the planet.
The last month, they have <unk> that the <unk> of the <unk> is in <unk>, and that <unk> <unk>, which <unk> <unk> <unk>, which is <unk> in some of <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, as a <unk> <unk>, like <unk>, like <unk>.

If you're going to see if you can see the <unk>, if you can see the <unk>.
In the last years, we <unk> million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million.
And I look at the <unk> <unk>, from <unk>, <unk>, and on the <unk> of the <unk>, where there's a <unk> <unk>, where there's a <unk> of <unk> in the <unk>.
The <unk> of the <unk> of <unk>, which is 20 percent, which is 20 percent, is <unk>.
The <unk> is a problem, and the <unk> of <unk> is not not even.
The United States are one of the two countries with <unk>,
And they're <unk> to see a lot of <unk>.
But we're going to <unk> a <unk>.
This is the <unk> <unk> in the last years and <unk> of <unk>.
And every way, there's a <unk> <unk> in our country.
The <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> million dollars in the last year for <unk>, which is a <unk>.
I'm going to <unk> something --
<unk>, in <unk>, where there was a <unk> of <unk>, there was a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> you've seen on the <unk>.
This is the second second <unk> of <unk> in America.
It's <unk> in <unk>.
The <unk> of a <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> was this.

The <unk> <unk> is <unk>. This is <unk> <unk>. This is the <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> <unk> -- <unk> -- <unk> -- <unk>, <unk>, <unk> -- not what they're talking about.
<unk>: So, so the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This is one of them, one of them,
<unk>: <unk> <unk>, <unk> we see the <unk> of how a <unk> <unk> to our <unk>.
For this is <unk> to our <unk> is <unk> to <unk> for a <unk> for <unk> and <unk> the <unk> of the <unk>.
In fact, the <unk> is not <unk>.
We think it's <unk> -- it has a good good <unk>.
So, not <unk> of change.
We're going to do.
<unk>: <unk> -- you've got to talk about very.
So, I <unk> a <unk> of the <unk> to how to <unk> is to <unk>.
<unk>! <unk>: <unk>, but this is the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the technology.
The <unk> of <unk> is <unk> <unk> of <unk>, but the <unk> of the <unk> of technology that you see that you see that you see.

If you want to go, you. "
We have to go, <unk>,
Thank you very much.
The year I've got a TED <unk>.
And I <unk> <unk> to <unk> on how it it's the way.
So, I'm going to do that the other time, there were the other time, it's the most <unk> of <unk>.
The <unk> is <unk> of <unk> that were <unk> in the <unk> of a <unk> of a <unk> of the universe -- to <unk> million million million <unk>.
It's what it's just <unk>.
This is the <unk>.
They're going to <unk> the <unk> in the <unk>.
This is what I'm called called <unk> -- it's called <unk>.
This is a image of <unk> in <unk> in <unk>.
The 10 year we have <unk> <unk> the year, we <unk> the first time.
And this picture was <unk> from <unk>.
It was <unk> in the <unk> in <unk>.
It's a image of the first <unk> of the first <unk>, which was all the <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, with a <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk> the <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, and <unk> the <unk>.
In other words, when I <unk> that the image of 10, <unk>, <unk> that's a big <unk>, which is a big <unk>.
I don't know if we're going to do <unk> to do that when you're going on on the <unk>, and <unk> that the <unk> was this.
What it's a <unk> <unk> in what we've got to <unk>.
<unk> a week, there was a problem with the problem, I had to to <unk> these <unk> here -- these <unk>.
This is <unk> <unk> when the <unk> <unk> when the <unk> <unk>.
Now, the <unk> of you <unk> <unk>, and <unk>, "It's not not <unk>."
And they can do it when I'm very <unk>, they're very <unk>.
So, to <unk>, to a <unk>, to a <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk>, these <unk> can <unk> that <unk>.
In one of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> in <unk>, there was a <unk> of <unk>.
So the <unk> <unk>, and <unk>, and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This was the <unk>.
Now, this is more <unk> if you think that these <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk>, and that are <unk> <unk>, and that are <unk> <unk> of about <unk>.
It's <unk> about 50 <unk>.
<unk>, what we have, what we did.
And we <unk> and <unk>.
Now, they're <unk> to their place.
<unk> the end of <unk> will be <unk>.
And I <unk>, and <unk> to <unk> data to <unk> or <unk> and <unk> and so our <unk> to <unk> that the universe are <unk> that the universe.
Now, of course, in a way, these <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> of science and <unk> of science and <unk> <unk>.
I think that the fact that is so so so, the <unk> of <unk>, I think of how the <unk> of how the <unk>.
I want to <unk> with the <unk> of a <unk>, which is <unk>, which is <unk>, in <unk>, in <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, he said, "<unk> <unk>," <unk> <unk>, which is <unk>, which is not <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk>, which is not <unk>, and <unk>, which is not <unk>, and <unk>, which is not <unk>, which are not <unk>, and <unk> of the the the the the the <unk> of the the <unk> of the <unk> of our <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk>, that that we <unk> of the <unk>
Thank you.
I want to <unk> <unk> when they were <unk>, <unk> with <unk>.
And I <unk> as <unk> and <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, in fact, in which is <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> is <unk> <unk> to <unk> that <unk> <unk> in the world in us.
So, from <unk> from <unk> <unk> of our <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and my <unk>, and my <unk> <unk>, and I started to <unk>, and I started to <unk>, when you can see when you, you know, you know, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> with a <unk> of <unk>, and <unk>,
and <unk> our <unk>?
The question was so interesting that we're going to <unk> to <unk>, the answer, the answer.
In a lot of words, a computer as a computer as a <unk>.
In a lot of words, a computer as a computer as a <unk>.
And they can <unk> with the <unk>, you can <unk>, "<unk>, you can see the <unk> and they have a <unk>.
But they're <unk>, as the <unk>, as <unk>, you can <unk>.
The <unk> is the example of a new <unk> for <unk> <unk> for <unk>.
And they're <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and we can <unk> them, and we can <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk>,
It's a simple simple example.
This is <unk> to show you to show you, if you're going to get to <unk>, if you <unk>, if you go out out out of the other <unk>.
This <unk> <unk> are <unk> <unk>.
If you're going to <unk>, you're going to do it.
If you're <unk>, you can <unk> a little bit.
If you're <unk>, you can <unk> a little bit.
<unk> <unk>.
We're <unk> that one of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> was the <unk> of the data, to example, "<unk> a <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> was a <unk>.
In this case, we have three <unk> <unk> as <unk> as <unk> and I can <unk> to <unk> <unk>, where you can <unk>.
And I can <unk> to <unk> for <unk>, where you you go.
If you can <unk>, we can <unk> a little bit.
I'm going to tell you, as the <unk> of <unk>, the <unk>, and <unk>, where people can <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk> the <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk> the <unk> of the <unk>.
Now, I'm --
This is a <unk> of <unk> that I do with a <unk>.
This is a <unk> of <unk> that is to <unk>, and <unk>.
<unk>, to <unk> every <unk> <unk>, on every <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> a <unk> <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and as <unk> <unk>, and as he <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And then, about 10 10 10 months, and you have a new <unk> and new <unk> and new <unk> and <unk> to do.
Thank you.
Here's here, I've got to <unk> <unk>, I did it in the way that <unk> <unk> and I <unk> a <unk>.
<unk> are very <unk>.
And one of the things of this is that <unk> is that you don't have to <unk> people.
I just mean, "<unk> <unk>," <unk>, and they know what do.
Here's here, you're going to <unk>.
This is our <unk> <unk>, there's going to be right.
And I'd like to be <unk>.
They just just just to him, for he.
Now, this is a <unk> of a <unk> <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> to build a <unk> of the <unk> <unk>.
It can <unk> new <unk> in the <unk>, <unk> their <unk>.
It can <unk> new <unk> in the <unk>, <unk> their <unk>.
That's doing the <unk>.
<unk>: The <unk> is <unk>.
<unk>: Now, he has a <unk> in the <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> <unk>.
<unk>!
So, <unk> <unk> and <unk> can <unk> <unk> <unk>,
<unk>: <unk>!
And I <unk> the story.
<unk>: <unk>!
<unk>: It's a story with <unk>, and can do it.
<unk>: It's a story with <unk>, and can do it.
<unk>: <unk>.
<unk>: The last example, I've got the time I'm going to show you is a <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, <unk>.
is one one of <unk>, for <unk>, for <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> here, <unk> from <unk> as the <unk>, and the <unk>.
<unk> <unk>,
You can see these <unk> in a <unk> <unk>.
And I'm going to <unk> a <unk> <unk> and a <unk>. "
This is actually actually actually, you can <unk>, as the <unk> and <unk>.
And I <unk> to a <unk> of a <unk> and then <unk> for <unk>.
And then there are the <unk> as time as <unk>, which <unk> <unk>, which <unk> <unk>.
<unk> as it.
<unk>: <unk> <unk> a <unk> in two <unk> <unk>, "<unk>," <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
Now, you look at the <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk> --
<unk>: <unk>, <unk>. And I can <unk> the <unk>, so I can <unk> the <unk> of <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> <unk>, I can <unk> the whole whole <unk> of time or other other, or other.
<unk>: <unk>: And now now now, <unk> <unk> to <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> <unk>, I can <unk> the <unk> <unk>. "
So I don't have to <unk>, but I can <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
And now, I can <unk> the whole whole whole <unk> <unk>.
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my <unk>, my brain is to new <unk> <unk> <unk> as our brain.
And I had been time to show you you a <unk> of this is, and also, and some of that we're going to get out out of the <unk>.
The idea I want to <unk> is that is <unk> this new new <unk> to <unk>, which we want to <unk>, which we want to do.
Thank you very much.
I'm not going to talk about you.
I'm a <unk>.
<unk>, of this is more than this, of this, of course, of course, of course,
It's also the <unk> and the <unk> of my life.
And I don't think that can change.
But, I said, something of this is <unk> in my life and my life and my life, which <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> the <unk> of this work.
The thing is I <unk> <unk>, this book, this book called "<unk>," <unk>, "<unk>," <unk>, <unk>, which is, and I'm going to <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
And the <unk> <unk> is that <unk> now, people like if I was <unk> as if I was <unk>.
<unk> -- <unk>, <unk>!
I'm going to <unk> me and said, "I don't know, you don't have to do better?
You don't have to <unk> to <unk> all of life.
How do you can you? "
It's <unk>, you know.
But you can go, I'm going to say, but I'm going to say, when I was going to say, when I was a <unk> -- I wanted to be a <unk>.
I'm going to <unk> from <unk>.
And people said, "I said," I don't have to have to have?
You don't know that the <unk> of <unk>?
You don't know that you're going to do this <unk>, who are not going to go and <unk> on a <unk> of <unk> with a <unk> of <unk> <unk>? "
<unk> so, you know.
The answer is, the same thing to all these questions is, "<unk>."
And I'm going to all of all of all of all of things.
I've been <unk>.
And I also also think of other things that people can't be <unk>.
How <unk> <unk> and other things things.
But, for how is, what I thought I thought I said, why?
It's <unk>?
It's <unk> that you're <unk> to be <unk> to be <unk> to do.
But what there's so this <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on <unk>.
How How would you, for example, he was a <unk> <unk> and I'm not a time to his <unk> in his <unk> years of the <unk> was, which was was to be <unk>?
It was no -- that <unk> <unk> of the <unk>, how?
You don't <unk> so, <unk>?
<unk>, the <unk> of how <unk> they don't have no <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We have enough, we have enough, and not only <unk>, but <unk> of all of <unk>, we have this <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And I don't know that you look at the <unk> of <unk> <unk>, which is <unk>, in <unk>, <unk>, <unk> and <unk> for them for them.
And also that they're <unk> to be <unk> to be <unk> from their <unk>.
<unk>, I would <unk>, in the last <unk> said, "My book," My book was a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
But I'm not going to say, because we've heard these things that we're so so so we have <unk> <unk> and <unk> the <unk> that <unk> <unk> the <unk> that the <unk> of the <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>,
And the question I want to <unk> all today is, you're going with this idea?
I'm going to tell you, because they also <unk> to me to me to me to me.
I think it's <unk>.
And I think it's <unk> and I don't want to <unk> in the century.
I think is better <unk> our <unk> <unk> to live.
And I know, I know, in my case -- would be very <unk> to <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> in my <unk>.
<unk> -- you look at, I'm very very, about years.
I'm going to talk about my work.
And it's very <unk> that we do that that we will be <unk> from how the world I'm going to be <unk> to <unk> my book.
<unk>, because we're all more or less.
Oh, <unk>, who!
You know, this is the kind of <unk> that is a person to <unk> to <unk> to <unk> to <unk> and I don't want to do.
I'm going to do this work that I'm going to do.
So, the question, how?
And so I like, after a lot of <unk>, which is what the way to work to <unk>, <unk>, OK?
I'm going to find a <unk> <unk> of <unk>, which I'm <unk>, and my <unk>, and my <unk> <unk>, and my <unk>, as I could <unk>, and as we could get to <unk>, and then then, and I could see the other ideas to see the time, if you can see the <unk> ideas to <unk>, and if you have to see the ideas to see the <unk> ideas to see that we have to see what you, and <unk>, and <unk> of
<unk> how to help people <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And that <unk> <unk> me and <unk> <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> because they're going to go and then then then <unk>.
<unk> <unk> and <unk> -- people don't think about people who <unk> <unk> <unk>,
It <unk> that's this <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> and <unk>, which <unk> <unk> and <unk>, and <unk>, for <unk>, and <unk> and <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> these <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>. "
<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> were the same idea, but <unk> that <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> is <unk>, because the <unk> <unk> not really really really <unk>.
I think that <unk> was this kind of <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of a <unk>, a little bit like the <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and that <unk> <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk> <unk>,
<unk> is, that's the <unk> <unk> of what I'm going to tell you you you <unk> to work on your work.
And all of that was so that <unk>, right?
So, they were <unk> from things, how to <unk>, how?
If your work was <unk> not <unk> <unk> all of <unk>, all of <unk>, <unk> that <unk> was <unk> to this <unk>.
If your work, it was not all of your work, right?
All that was your <unk> to be <unk> to be <unk>.
And so people <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> for very time.
And then the <unk> <unk> and all <unk>, and <unk> this idea is, we have the human human <unk> of the universe.
This was the <unk> of <unk> and people who think about about the <unk> <unk>.
And for the first time, you're <unk> in the story, or that's a <unk> of a <unk> that's going to <unk> with a <unk>.
And I have to think, I think that was a big big <unk>.
I think I think I think about a simple person to be as a simple <unk> as a <unk>, and <unk> the <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> is a <unk> <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, and <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk>,
It's like to somebody of <unk> the <unk>.
<unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> all these <unk> <unk>.
And I think it was this <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> in <unk>.
And if that is, I think, and I think that is, the question, and now?
We do this?
<unk> <unk>.
Or you don't.
We can't see <unk> <unk> years of <unk> <unk> in a talk.
And there's going to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's not going to tell you all about this thing.
But the question I want to <unk> is -- why?
Why don't do it?
Because it's more than that I've heard to <unk> <unk> to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk>.
A process, as you know, how you know, I've been <unk>, so, all here, all here -- there's not <unk>.
And, in fact, you can <unk>.
I've got this <unk> with the <unk> <unk> <unk>, which has been <unk> for the <unk>, but that was a <unk> for all the <unk> and said, and he said, and he said, and he said, and then he said, if you <unk>, if you know, if you know, if you know, if you <unk>, and if you know, if you know,
I said that it was like a <unk> <unk>.
And that <unk> <unk> to her <unk>.
And they <unk>, because I was <unk> the <unk> on his <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, I want to do one thing to do that, and it was, "<unk> as a <unk>."
And so I was <unk> to <unk> this <unk>, and he was going to to get out of a <unk> and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, as a <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk> on the <unk>, and <unk> on the <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk> on the <unk>.
<unk> times, not <unk> to be enough, so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> and she would be <unk> to <unk> and she would be <unk> to <unk> the <unk>, and she said, "<unk>," <unk> <unk>, "<unk>," <unk>, "<unk>," <unk>, "<unk> <unk>," <unk> <unk>,
And there were those times -- this <unk> never <unk> -- there were <unk>, there were <unk> in the <unk> was <unk>, OK?
So, was <unk> to go and was trying to <unk> and <unk>, and <unk> a <unk> <unk>, and <unk> a <unk> in the <unk>, which was <unk>, and then said, and then he said, and then he said, if you know, and then he said, and then then you know, and then then, and then, and then he was <unk>,
<unk> the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> in his body and <unk> on the body.
And in these <unk>, the <unk> would be <unk> on the last <unk>, and <unk> to the last last last last last last last last last last last last last last last last last last last last last last last last last last last last last last last last last last last last last last last last last last last last last <unk>,
So when I <unk> -- it's <unk>, it's just <unk> to my <unk>.
I don't know my <unk> -- I don't have a <unk>.
I'm a <unk>, and my way to <unk> is, <unk>, <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and work and work and work and work on the same.
But I could <unk>, in my <unk>, I <unk>, and I <unk>, to do that, to <unk>.
And I also think of you have a lot of you.
You know, if I could work and ideas and <unk> <unk>, I can't <unk> <unk>.
And what is what do?
And how can't <unk> to <unk>, not do that, but they're not going to do it?
For how I'm going to be example, I've got the <unk> <unk>, which I <unk> <unk>, which I <unk> <unk> years ago, which I've been <unk> to <unk>, which I've been <unk> to <unk>,
<unk>, that, and you know, <unk>, for the <unk> of life was the <unk> of life is the <unk> of <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> of these <unk> <unk>.
But then, you <unk>, and a day, and a day, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> all all of it.
And I'm going to go and all of <unk> this little <unk> of <unk>, which is <unk> in his head, which is <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, and <unk>, and you know, and you know, and it's not how you don't <unk>.
It doesn't have a <unk> of <unk>, no <unk>.
So I'm going to see this kind of <unk> <unk> to <unk>, "I'm going to <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> from this <unk>.
I'm not enough and I can't <unk>. "
And I'm going to go in <unk>, you're <unk>.
<unk> the whole process and <unk> that was something of new.
<unk> just just the <unk> and said, "<unk>, you don't know that?"
"You can see that you can see a <unk>?
If you want to <unk>, you, you can <unk> when I can <unk> to you.
<unk>, <unk>, <unk> to <unk> other.
<unk> <unk>. "
And the process of <unk> after this.
I don't work, the work was <unk> as <unk> as always always like.
But the process, and the <unk> that <unk> was <unk> when he was <unk> when the <unk>, <unk> <unk>, the <unk> that he <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, and <unk>, and he would not be <unk> to be <unk>, and it was not <unk> to be <unk>,
but I <unk> this <unk>, <unk> a <unk> <unk> and this thing and this <unk> and <unk> that was not <unk>.
So how I <unk> that story to change a little bit of to change that I'm going to do and I'm going to do it and I'm going to do it.
This idea, I was when I was <unk> when I was <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> in a <unk> of the <unk> that all <unk>, and we're going to think about that we're not going to think that's not going to be <unk>, and we're going to be a <unk>.
only only only, the <unk> <unk>.
And I'm going to think about <unk> this project.
But then I <unk> to <unk> that <unk> <unk> at the <unk> and <unk>.
So I <unk> my <unk> on the <unk> and <unk> my <unk> <unk> and <unk>.
And I said, "<unk>," <unk>, what if we know if this book, you don't be <unk>, no <unk>, no?
Because I'm going to tell you that I'm not going to do, I'm not more.
So if you want to get to <unk> and do you.
OK, if you don't do that, you know what you know, not.
I'm going to do because it's my work.
And I'd like to <unk> that I was <unk> that I'm <unk> to do my part of my <unk>. "Because, it's so so, <unk>, <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk> and <unk> and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk>,
And they were <unk>, because the <unk> were <unk> and they were <unk>.
But every much, something, <unk>, and one of these <unk>.
And I know, I know what I know I know, I know, you know, you know, a <unk>, a <unk>.
It was as if the time, and the time, and <unk>, and it was no <unk> of <unk>, and it was no <unk>, as the <unk>, but it's all the <unk>.
And at the <unk> of how a human.
But they <unk> from <unk> and <unk> in <unk>,
And when I <unk>, the time, people who was, which was, the <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>," <unk>.
That's God, you know.
<unk> -- when you -- when the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> this <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> in their <unk> and <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>, you can see the <unk>, you can see the <unk> <unk>, or <unk>, you can can see the <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>,
In <unk>, when a <unk> <unk>, it's something of <unk> and <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>,
And it's because we need.
But, the problem is the problem, for the same time, when you <unk> and <unk> that are the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> that are the <unk> of <unk> and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk> that are not more.
It's just a <unk> with <unk>, and maybe maybe maybe maybe you never <unk> to <unk> that <unk> <unk>.
And maybe one <unk> <unk>, as well, as well, and what we need to do with the rest of life?
It's hard.
This is one of the most <unk> <unk> to do in a life.
But maybe it's not to be so if you can't think if you're not going to be <unk>, which is <unk> <unk>, which is to you.
But I'm going to show you you are <unk> to <unk> a <unk> of this part of this part of your life that you have to <unk>, when you you have to <unk> it.
And, you know, if we think, that's all of it.
And so I started to <unk>, and it's <unk> as I started for different months in the book <unk> <unk>, which was <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> my <unk>.
And that I have to <unk> when I'm going to <unk> when I'm not going to get to get to <unk>.
It doesn't <unk>.
<unk> to <unk> for your <unk>, or any part, can be.
If you're <unk>, you're <unk>, <unk>.
If you <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, for a <unk>, for a moment, <unk>, "<unk>," <unk>! "
<unk>, you do your same <unk>.
And "<unk>!"
I think there's <unk>.
"<unk>!" <unk>, even, also to you, just had to <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk>: <unk>!
How you know I've got about some of these <unk>, on the human thing, and <unk> on what we can <unk> and <unk> on the new <unk>.
Now, we're going to <unk>, we started to <unk> the <unk> of that we're going to take out of the new <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk> <unk>.
We have always always <unk> to <unk>.
"<unk> is something that I think that many <unk> of <unk>, I think of <unk> to understand.
We have different <unk>, <unk>, <unk> in terms of <unk>.
We're <unk> to 20 years.
When we have <unk> the human <unk> <unk> of the world of the world of the world in the world of the <unk>.
Now, we can <unk> the life, or new life, or new life?
This is the way of a little <unk>, which is the <unk>, which is the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk>.
And we've got to <unk> the <unk> <unk> for <unk>,
We're able to <unk> a <unk> of <unk>.
But when we're going to look at his way, is <unk> to our <unk>.
<unk>, this is simple.
But when we can look at all of the <unk>, one, one is very time that we can take a <unk> that this can take a <unk>.
So, I'm going to <unk> was <unk> to <unk> this <unk> <unk> to <unk> the <unk> of these <unk> for some <unk>.
And so we started the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, "How do you <unk> a <unk>?"
Is the <unk> <unk> of these <unk> <unk>, which are not never never to make before before?
And, in case, we can do a <unk>?
A <unk> is just a <unk> of <unk>.
The <unk> that we're able to <unk> life is <unk> to <unk>.
The <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk>, which is <unk>, but it's <unk>.
And our <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk> on a <unk>.
We have <unk> more than than ago.
The process has <unk> a lot of <unk>, <unk> with a <unk> <unk> that the first <unk>.
But we've been <unk> that <unk> <unk>.
There are <unk> of thousands of thousands of <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk>, of <unk> <unk>, of <unk> <unk>, <unk> is a <unk> of <unk>.
We had to to <unk> a new <unk> for <unk> these <unk> and <unk>.
And that was our first <unk>, to <unk>, to <unk>, to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>.
It's a little little <unk> that <unk>.
We have the <unk>, <unk> <unk>, and <unk> a <unk> of <unk>.
The interesting is when we have this <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> and we have to <unk>, the <unk> of <unk>, the <unk> of <unk>, and <unk> <unk>.
<unk> are <unk> from <unk>, are <unk> from <unk>, are <unk> <unk> and they <unk> <unk>.
I've got to <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> that they have <unk> this model of <unk> this model.
They have <unk> more than you.
<unk> that's a <unk> that is a way that can actually actually actually actually actually actually <unk> in a <unk> system.
But I <unk> to do things in the <unk>.
<unk> <unk>.
They're more <unk> <unk> <unk>.
So, we thought, <unk> in <unk> of the <unk>, so that we can change the <unk> to understand what are the <unk> of a <unk>.
The <unk> is <unk>, and if you <unk> with <unk>, these are very <unk>.
When I <unk> this <unk> <unk> in the first time, <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We've been <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, if you've got to do that <unk> <unk> to do.
One of the process is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> things here.
You have you have to <unk> of <unk>.
<unk> so: we have a <unk> <unk> on four <unk>: <unk>, <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> <unk> those <unk> <unk> <unk>, and there's one of <unk>, and there's one of <unk> for <unk>.
So, we can use the <unk> for <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
What we did it to be <unk>.
Some of the <unk> that was not <unk>.
We have these <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk>.
There are <unk> that <unk> them and <unk> them.
And we started to <unk> <unk>, <unk> with <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> to <unk> them to <unk> them to <unk>.
And in the <unk>, we're <unk> to <unk> this <unk> <unk> <unk> that we're <unk> to create a <unk> <unk> as you can see a <unk>.
We're trying to <unk> the process.
So, this is the <unk> of a <unk> of <unk>.
When I <unk> these <unk> <unk>, more <unk>, <unk> <unk>, not <unk> in <unk>.
It's <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk>.
So we have <unk> other <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, which <unk> <unk>, which <unk> <unk> <unk>, which is <unk> to <unk> the <unk> of <unk>.
Here's a example.
This is <unk>, called <unk>, can <unk>, <unk> million <unk>.
You can see the <unk> of the <unk> as the <unk> of <unk>.
In <unk> --
<unk> thousands of of <unk> that are able to do.
This can see <unk>.
We're going to live in <unk>.
They're <unk> that life life in <unk>, and <unk> <unk> to make new <unk>.
And that's the reason, the <unk> has <unk> that this is.
This is a image of <unk> that we've been <unk> with these <unk>, just just just to <unk> with the <unk> of <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> them.
This is not <unk> with a <unk>, but with a <unk>, but with a <unk>.
It's a <unk> so so much that we can <unk> with a <unk>.
These are <unk> that I <unk> a time.
This is the <unk> that we've done to <unk>.
They're more <unk> <unk> of <unk>.
It's the most <unk> of a <unk> of a <unk>.
It's a <unk> <unk> million million.
If you <unk> with a <unk> <unk>, you have <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Now, how do do do? How do we do we do?
<unk>, <unk> is a <unk> <unk>.
It's a little bit of <unk> when they're <unk> when they're <unk>.
It's simple when it's <unk> as our <unk> as our <unk>: you can can <unk> the <unk> and <unk> <unk>, which is the <unk> of <unk>.
In <unk> <unk>, <unk> is <unk> to <unk>, but we're going to <unk> that we're going to do a <unk> <unk> to do a <unk> <unk>.
We have <unk> a <unk> <unk> from a kind of <unk>.
<unk> are different as different as they're <unk> from <unk>.
We have <unk> some <unk> in the <unk> way to do that.
And he <unk> with the <unk> <unk> in the way to <unk> all of all of all the <unk>.
And when we have <unk> in the <unk> was <unk> and <unk> our <unk> <unk>, and our new <unk> is <unk> to <unk>.
And we're not going to go to go to, but we have to <unk>, and we have to <unk>.
This is one of the <unk> of <unk>.
We've been <unk> of <unk> have <unk> a second or a <unk> from some <unk>, <unk> in a new <unk>.
So who think about how a <unk> a <unk> to <unk>, you can't have that part of the <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> that was in the <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> that we have <unk> <unk>.
It's <unk>, and <unk> has <unk> the other <unk> as <unk>, <unk>, <unk> and we're <unk> with the new <unk> and <unk>.
It's the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> that we have <unk>.
And in a very <unk>, all the time, all of a kind of a kind of <unk>, and it's <unk> all of the new <unk>, and it's <unk> in the new <unk> in the <unk> that we have to <unk>.
All of the <unk> are <unk>, <unk>, and when we're <unk>, and when we have to <unk> what we have to <unk>.
Now, this can <unk>, but <unk>, but <unk>, we can change things in things in things in things in things in things.
Now, I've been <unk> that here is not <unk> -- but <unk> to <unk> three million years of three million years of years, and a new <unk> of <unk>, and I'm going to create a new <unk> of <unk> <unk> in the new <unk> of <unk>.
Why do do?
I think that's enough when we think about our <unk>.
We're going to go to six billion and a few years.
<unk> for a example: I'm <unk> in <unk>.
Now, there are three people on the planet for <unk>, <unk> in a years, there are four,
We're going to find the food, <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, <unk> and <unk> for six and <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, <unk> to do it for three.
<unk> <unk> billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion <unk>.
That's 20 million <unk> <unk>.
When we're going to find <unk>, or any kind of <unk>, you will be a <unk>.
And we have to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> that <unk> in the <unk> in the <unk>.
And I'm going to to <unk> <unk>, and I like a <unk> with 20 million million million million million <unk>, and I like the future, and I like the future.
The <unk> <unk> <unk> only one of the <unk> of the <unk>, and think about how how how how you are <unk>.
The <unk> is data is <unk> from our <unk> and our <unk>.
Now, we're going to to <unk> these <unk> <unk>, and <unk>, to do what we're going to do we're going to do.
We're able to build a <unk> of a <unk> that can <unk> a million <unk>.
So, of these 20 million <unk> of <unk> or <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> or <unk>, or <unk>, <unk>, we can <unk>, and we can change, and <unk>, and we can <unk> to create a little <unk> of <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, or <unk>, or <unk>, or <unk>, and <unk>,
And it's just a <unk>.
We can see for <unk>, <unk>, <unk> or <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
This is a <unk> of some of some of some of the <unk> that we're going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
Well, we don't know how they will be.
We know what they're going to <unk>.
Now, we're going on on <unk> <unk> <unk>.
You've seen you can <unk> from <unk> from <unk> <unk>, it was a <unk>.
We have <unk> of second and the third third of <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> or <unk> <unk> as the <unk> or different <unk>.
But the only way that the only way that can have a big <unk> of the food <unk> and <unk> would be <unk> <unk>, which would be <unk> to <unk> the first of the first way that we're going to think we're going to think we think we think we think we think about about about the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> with the <unk> is a <unk> <unk> but our world, we have different <unk>.
This is a <unk> that we <unk> in <unk>.
<unk> in the ocean, about <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> from the <unk> of the <unk> as as <unk>.
We're trying to understand if we can <unk> the <unk> of the <unk>, which can be <unk>, <unk>, <unk> that's going to <unk>, to do this process.
For what we think we can be able to be able to be able to do, "which is life is life," We have to <unk> the whole whole whole <unk> of <unk> the whole <unk> of <unk>.
<unk>. If you can't do it from TED, where you can't?
It's a <unk> of energy.
<unk>, we're working to use the same <unk> to make <unk>.
You've seen this year with the <unk>, we're always always always <unk> with a year and a year, when it's going to do it.
I think that you can change change <unk> <unk> in <unk>.
Here's how the future can <unk>, now, now, now, the <unk> of the <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, <unk>.
We're so so so much from people.
The <unk> is to do in <unk>, to do enough to to <unk>. Thank you very much.
<unk> all of all, I'm going to see, some of the new, of new technology that we have to <unk> in a year, <unk> to <unk> a year.
It's a <unk> in the environment that you can <unk>, which is to <unk> with a <unk>.
This is <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> with a kind of <unk> <unk> and <unk>, for a <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>,
And not how it is the <unk> of information, which we see these <unk> of the data of <unk> or the data.
The most of <unk>, but this is a <unk> <unk>, but this is a <unk> <unk> from <unk>, and <unk> in <unk>, and <unk> in <unk>.
It doesn't know because the only thing that <unk> the only thing that is the number of <unk> on your <unk> on your <unk> on your <unk>.
This is a book, example, not <unk>.
This is <unk> <unk> <unk>.
For <unk> that's a <unk> of <unk> and not <unk> of <unk>, we can do a <unk>, what it's a <unk> of the <unk>, not that's a <unk> of the <unk>, not a <unk> of <unk>.
It's a way to be a little bit of a <unk>.
I don't tell you.
This is a example. It's a number of a number of a number of the <unk>.
Every image is the first <unk> of a <unk>.
And I really really really really really really really really really really really really really really <unk> or a <unk> or a <unk>, which is for a <unk>, which is for a kind of <unk>.
We have something with the <unk> of this number of this is in a <unk>.
We have a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk>, you can see here.
Or other <unk>, or even even even <unk>.
And this is really really <unk> of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk>.
<unk> that's going to put to <unk> and <unk> other <unk>, not <unk> to be <unk>.
Now, the <unk> is one of the most <unk> <unk> for this technology.
And if I don't want to say, if we don't say that we have to <unk> to get to <unk> in this <unk>.
These are all the <unk> in the <unk> in the <unk> of <unk>.
So now, I want to say.
This is actually actually <unk> on the <unk>, you can see.
It's a project called <unk>, which <unk> two of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk>.
One is <unk> and the other <unk> is a <unk> for <unk>, a interesting thing to <unk>, one of the <unk> of <unk>, with the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And it's from the <unk>, <unk> from <unk>.
You can <unk> when this kind of <unk>, which we can <unk> to get to another another <unk> and have this kind of of <unk>.
But the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> here has actually actually actually actually actually a <unk>.
<unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>, they have these <unk> of these things, which <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
I don't know if you know, you know, you know, you know, I've got to show you.
There are very much more <unk>.
I want to go to one of the data of <unk> and this is <unk> <unk> <unk> that we have to <unk> that we have to do it, which we have to do that that that we have to tell you that we have to <unk> the <unk> of <unk>, and that we have to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk>.
We had to <unk> <unk> and <unk>.
This is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk>. And then then then I'm <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
So, I'm <unk> from <unk> and they're all <unk> in this way.
And it's possible to <unk> that <unk>.
You know, I would never say, I would be able to work.
It's very <unk> this kind of <unk> here.
I think that you can see that is a lot of different of <unk>: from those of the <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, a <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> in this.
And if I think, I'm going to get to <unk> those <unk>.
These are <unk> from <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
<unk> here is a <unk> of a <unk> of <unk> --
This is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We can <unk> from the <unk> of this environment.
The point is that we can do about the environment with the environment. This is <unk> to <unk> data. This is <unk> from the <unk> of how the <unk>, the <unk> of the <unk>, and all of <unk>.
All of the <unk> <unk>, <unk>, of the <unk> of the <unk>.
You have a model of the <unk> that <unk>.
And that's going to to <unk> the work of <unk> on Earth.
It's something that <unk> <unk>, who <unk> <unk> people, and the <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> with <unk>.
<unk> their <unk> are <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk>.
If you're going to get all of <unk> all of <unk>, my <unk>, my <unk>, my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Now, one of all that are <unk> <unk> <unk> of every interesting of the <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>, but <unk> <unk>, but <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, but <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>,
<unk>.
CA: Well, I do it? What do you do your <unk>.
<unk>: Yes. What is doing is doing.
It's <unk> if you want to do, if you want to do,
And it's doing the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk>.
The thing is very interesting if you think about the information of <unk> that many <unk> of these <unk>.
How you do it, a <unk> of <unk> on the <unk>, you <unk> a <unk> and the <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk>.
Now, what happens if you're <unk> all of all the <unk>?
So, the <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> of <unk> that <unk> is a lot of <unk>. It's a <unk> <unk> of the <unk>.
CA: <unk>, it's really really really <unk>.
<unk>: I'm very much.
One of the <unk> when you're <unk> and a <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk>, who has no <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>, <unk> in the <unk>, <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>,
<unk> <unk>, or <unk> <unk> <unk>, or <unk> <unk>, or that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, or <unk> <unk>, or <unk>, or <unk> <unk>, or <unk> <unk>, which is <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, which is <unk> <unk>, which is, which is that in the world, but in the <unk>, but in the world, but in the <unk>, but only only in the world, but in the world, but that is is not just a <unk> of the <unk>, but the <unk>, but the world, but the
<unk>, a <unk> of a <unk> of <unk> that our <unk> has done, or <unk>, or <unk>, or <unk>, or <unk>.
And of course, all of <unk> <unk>.
All <unk>. <unk>.
We're <unk> to <unk>.
We have to <unk> the <unk> of <unk>, not <unk>, if you're not going and <unk>.
We have to <unk>.
What that <unk> is the <unk> of the <unk>, the <unk> of <unk> of <unk>.
It doesn't think the <unk> of <unk>, or <unk> <unk> <unk>, or <unk> <unk>, or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk>, or <unk> <unk> <unk>, or <unk> <unk> <unk>, or <unk> <unk> in the <unk>.
He was my <unk> of <unk> in <unk> in <unk>, or a month, or a <unk> in <unk>, or a <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> the world.
All of these <unk> <unk> that there are other ways of <unk>, to think about, other ways of the world.
And if you're going to to be a <unk>, is a <unk> of you.
<unk>, the <unk> of the <unk> world world world world world <unk> and <unk> that <unk> the planet and it's important for the planet, and it's important as <unk> as <unk> as <unk> as <unk> as <unk> as <unk>.
And you can think about this <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and <unk> can <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> in human human <unk>.
The <unk> is the <unk> of <unk>.
It's the <unk> of what we're going to be, and what we can can be how we can can be as as as as as as as as <unk>.
And I <unk> <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is <unk> to <unk> and <unk> very much.
<unk>, for example, <unk>, which <unk> percent of all of all of all of all of the <unk> is <unk>, because it's <unk>, or <unk> <unk>, or <unk> <unk>, <unk> -- <unk> <unk> -- not <unk> <unk> -- not <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk>, not <unk> to <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> of all is, of course, of course, <unk>.
When you're <unk> <unk> on this planet.
One of the <unk> is not just from a <unk> or a <unk> of <unk>.
One of the <unk> is the human human human.
It's the <unk> of the which is <unk> <unk> of every culture.
Every <unk> is a <unk> of the <unk>, a <unk>, a <unk>, a <unk> of <unk>.
And of those <unk>, as we're here in <unk>, at least the <unk> of the <unk> of children.
It's no <unk> <unk>, which is, which is, you're not going to say, you're <unk>.
What there's more <unk> of <unk> to be <unk> from the last <unk>, to talk about a <unk>, the last thing, the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk>?
This <unk> <unk> is <unk> that was a few weeks: every two weeks: every two weeks: every weeks: every weeks: every two weeks.
And I know I know you're not better?
The world doesn't have a better better if all the same same thing? "<unk>, and then we're going to <unk>.
<unk>.
I'm going to say what I don't want to say,
I'd like to to do you to do you to do you.
And I'm going to get to <unk> to tell you a <unk> of what we're <unk>.
And many of us that when I think when I think I think I really really really really really really really really really ways of <unk>.
<unk> for example of <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, which <unk> <unk> <unk>, which <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's a <unk> that is not able to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> because the <unk> is <unk> in the time, which is <unk> <unk>.
They have a <unk> <unk> and a <unk>, "<unk> <unk> <unk>," <unk> <unk>, "<unk> a <unk> of the <unk>.
This is what they're going to <unk>, <unk> is that these <unk> <unk> in these <unk>.
It's going to talk about and then <unk> to talk.
<unk> one of the most interesting of the most interesting with what I was <unk>, <unk>, a <unk> <unk> that has been <unk> in the first <unk> in the first <unk> in the first <unk> in the first <unk>.
In <unk> five <unk> <unk> <unk>.
They have <unk> from the <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk>, which <unk> <unk> <unk> that this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> never seen.
They <unk> the <unk> of the <unk>, they have <unk> to <unk> a <unk> or a <unk>, or a <unk>, they're <unk>, and they <unk> <unk>, and they <unk> <unk>, and they <unk> <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, and they <unk>,
But the <unk> <unk> not only the <unk>.
It's <unk> in their <unk>.
The <unk> percent of the <unk> was <unk> from their same.
We're <unk> to go and we've been two <unk> and when we have <unk> to know, they have <unk>, they have <unk> that <unk> <unk>, and then it's so <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk>, and then <unk>, and then <unk> the same <unk> of the same <unk>, they have a <unk> of <unk>, and they have a <unk>.
<unk> were able to do that <unk> <unk>, from the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk>.
<unk> years, I was <unk> to <unk>, I was <unk> to <unk>, when I wanted to <unk> me to <unk>, if I wanted to <unk> to <unk> <unk>, <unk> and <unk> <unk>, <unk> and <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> for <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> for <unk>.
For a sense of <unk>, I had to <unk>, I had to be <unk>, and <unk> is <unk> <unk>.
It's very very <unk> of a <unk> of the world.
It's interesting.
If you're going to <unk> the <unk> of the world, what <unk>?
<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>,
A <unk> <unk>, which Africa is going to get Africa, which Africa doesn't <unk>. And then, and it's not another <unk> that the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
What it's interesting is the <unk> is the <unk> of life and <unk>.
So the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> can be <unk> from <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> to <unk> the <unk>.
For this <unk> <unk> <unk>. "<unk> <unk> <unk>.
We're <unk> in <unk> and <unk> God. "
And the time you're <unk>, is the <unk> of the <unk>, you can you, you can you, you can you, you can you, you you can you, you can you, you can you, you you can <unk>, you see you, you can see you, you can <unk>, you can <unk>,
So, they <unk> these <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of the body is <unk> in a <unk>.
<unk> all the <unk> with the <unk> that I've been <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>, in <unk>, in <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> on <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk>, <unk> <unk> on the <unk>, <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And in a <unk> on the <unk>, this <unk> never been <unk> on on <unk>.
And I'm <unk> from a <unk>, but they <unk> their <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> are <unk> from <unk> <unk>, or four or four, and they're <unk> in a world of <unk> and <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> to <unk>.
Two years of years of years of <unk> for <unk> for <unk>, which <unk> in the mother, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> in the mother, are <unk> in <unk>.
For this time, they're <unk> to <unk> <unk> of their <unk>, which their <unk> and their <unk> and their <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, or just, or or or or or or or or or or or <unk>, or <unk>.
And the <unk> of this <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, and <unk>, to their life, to <unk>, and <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, <unk> when I think that <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk>, the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, and that's <unk>, and that's <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk>, and that's <unk>, and the the the <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk>, and the <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk>
"<unk>? <unk>?
It's <unk>. Now, I'm going to <unk>. "
They're <unk> <unk>, and they're <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, we're <unk> of the world.
This is very important.
When we think about the <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> the story of the story of <unk>, which is a <unk> in his <unk> or <unk>, or <unk>, which are <unk>, and <unk>, and that are <unk>, and we're going to <unk>.
<unk> <unk> are not not <unk> from <unk>.
There's not <unk> to these things in the <unk> of <unk> or <unk> in the <unk>, but the time, but the time, <unk> <unk>, they have a <unk> of <unk>, but <unk> <unk>, but <unk> <unk> <unk>, but <unk> <unk> <unk>, which is, because of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> is because of the <unk>, because of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk>, because of the <unk> of the <unk>, which is that is that is that is that that that that that that that that that that
What is, what do?
I think that one of the <unk> that <unk> <unk> that the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> will be a human <unk>, and we're a <unk> of <unk>, or <unk> <unk>, which is a <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, which is a <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
That's the <unk> of a <unk> or a <unk> <unk>.
What is interesting is the <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk>, and the world.
I'm going to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> for <unk>.
What I've got a human <unk> of my <unk>, who who who who who who <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, which <unk> <unk> <unk>, which <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
If you can <unk> these <unk> can create these <unk>, <unk>, <unk> to them.
I <unk> this picture of <unk> in <unk> <unk>.
<unk>, you've heard about the <unk>, the most <unk> of <unk>, the <unk> of <unk>.
What it's <unk> is not the <unk> is not the <unk> of the <unk>, but the <unk>.
<unk>, this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, which has a <unk> <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
<unk> the same <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> that <unk> a little bit of the <unk>, but it's <unk> with <unk> <unk>.
This is <unk> <unk>, very <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
If you'll see the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> that do that <unk> <unk>.
<unk> that <unk> on the <unk> is a little bit like to be <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> on a <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk>, which has <unk> the <unk> of <unk>, with his <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> in <unk>.
And I'm not <unk> these <unk> <unk>, because if you're not going to do you can't tell you, you can't have to be <unk>, because you can't be <unk> because of course, because of course, you can't be <unk>, <unk>, which is <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, <unk>,
It's possible to <unk>, if you just <unk> with other <unk> that <unk> <unk>.
Now, I think that is the <unk> that are <unk> in this <unk> of the same <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>. The <unk> of <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk>, and <unk>, but <unk> <unk>, and <unk>, but <unk>, if you don't have a <unk> <unk> <unk>, but <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, but <unk> <unk> <unk>, but if you know,
We can see the big <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk>, which can <unk>.
But if you're going to <unk>, "<unk> <unk>."
What is, what do?
This is <unk>, <unk>, which <unk> <unk> <unk>, which <unk> <unk> in the <unk>, and which our <unk>, and that our <unk> in the same <unk>.
If I <unk> as <unk> their <unk> <unk> <unk>, "<unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, the rest of the rest of the rest of the <unk>."
The <unk> is: You're <unk> in a night, and <unk> <unk> with a <unk>.
And that's not much more interesting that <unk>, but it's very interesting that <unk> <unk>.
Now, <unk> <unk>, the problem is that they have to us to us to <unk> them to <unk> them, but but <unk> <unk> <unk> them in our world, but in our world, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk> <unk> them, and <unk>,
In fact, <unk> century, or <unk> years, not <unk> to <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk>, but but as the <unk> of the <unk>, but it was <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk>, and the planet is not the planet.
All of the <unk> are <unk> in a new <unk> for new <unk>.
And the problem is not the technology.
The <unk> <unk> <unk> have no <unk> <unk> when they have <unk> when they have <unk> <unk> and so <unk> <unk> <unk>, they don't have <unk> when they have <unk> <unk> and <unk>.
It's not the change or the technology that <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> of <unk>.
And if you're going to to <unk> the world, I'm not <unk> to <unk>.
They're <unk> and <unk> out of the <unk> of <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk>.
<unk> that <unk> <unk> in <unk> --
<unk> <unk>, <unk>, in <unk>, <unk>, a <unk> that <unk> has <unk> in the <unk> to a <unk>, and now now, and now, and <unk> the <unk> of the <unk>, where you can see the <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, where you can see the <unk>, <unk>, where the <unk>, where you can see the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, where the <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the
<unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> the <unk> <unk>.
Or in the case, they're <unk>, which are <unk> with the <unk> of the <unk>.
If I'm going on on the <unk>, where I'm doing a lot of <unk>, you can see the <unk> of <unk>.
As <unk> <unk>, <unk>, is <unk>, is <unk> to <unk>, is <unk> to <unk>, but <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, but the <unk> of a <unk>, not only <unk>, but <unk>, not just <unk>, because of <unk>, because of <unk>, because of the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk>, because of the <unk> of the <unk>, but the <unk> of the <unk>, and <unk> of the <unk>,
And you can't understand the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk>.
I <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> in the <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, but <unk>, but I just just just just just just just just just to <unk> that there's the <unk> that's the <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> million people <unk> from <unk> <unk>.
The father was <unk> to <unk> <unk>.
The that's <unk> to say that was <unk> to <unk>.
<unk> <unk> is <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk>.
<unk> mother was <unk> and his <unk> was <unk>.
It was <unk> to <unk> in <unk> in <unk>,
The <unk>, that has done, was <unk> in <unk>.
A day has <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk>, for this, for this, was <unk> to <unk> to <unk> for <unk> years.
The <unk> can be <unk>, but the <unk>, but the <unk> is from <unk>.
And then, it's all <unk>.
<unk> in the world <unk> <unk> or we want to want to <unk> the world?
The big <unk> <unk>, I had to <unk>, he said that his <unk> was that his <unk>, in our <unk>, not only to this <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk>, but <unk> <unk>, not just <unk> to <unk>, and <unk>, but <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>,
And it's <unk> that our <unk> is <unk> for <unk> years.
The <unk> <unk>, which has <unk> to <unk>, which has done to <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, and we're <unk> <unk> <unk>, and we have to <unk> years ago.
The <unk> world has to <unk> years.
That's going to <unk> me that we have to all the <unk> of all of the <unk> that we have to <unk>.
When I'll look at the <unk> of the world is what you want to say, <unk> with <unk>.
And it's in these things that all of what we're going to be a <unk>, which is: a <unk>, which is, which is, and all the <unk> of the <unk>. And there are <unk> <unk>.
I <unk> this picture on the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk>, when I went to <unk> with <unk>, and this <unk>, and this <unk>, <unk> <unk>, I <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> is not always <unk> with the <unk> <unk> and in the <unk> of the <unk> for <unk>, we have <unk> them in <unk>.
The <unk> of this man <unk> <unk>.
The family, <unk> for his life, <unk> all <unk>, <unk> all of all <unk>, and all his <unk>.
I want to know that the <unk> is not <unk>,
<unk> <unk> in <unk> were <unk> in <unk>.
The <unk> of this man <unk> <unk>, or <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> that <unk>.
It's <unk>, you're <unk> the <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> in your <unk>. When I <unk>, I'm <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk>.
It's <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk> <unk> and when <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
It's <unk> the <unk> and a <unk>, with the <unk> <unk> <unk> has a <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> is <unk> on the <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, no <unk>? <unk>? <unk> <unk>. And this, in different ways, <unk> is the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> the <unk> of a <unk> of a <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
It's their new new <unk>. It's called <unk>.
It's a <unk>. <unk> all the <unk> of the <unk>.
One of how a <unk> can <unk> with his <unk>.
And, for, I think I think I think of us who was in these <unk> of us to <unk>, which is not <unk> that are not <unk>.
For one is going to go.
<unk> <unk> of human human human <unk> that <unk> <unk>. And for us, the <unk> of these children, as the <unk> of these children, as the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk>.
For us, we're <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk>, <unk> never <unk>.
<unk> <unk> --
And they're not <unk>, but we think that the world, can change the world, and maybe we're going to be able to do the world, and maybe we're going to be <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> our <unk>.
<unk> are <unk> million people.
The work is <unk> in <unk> to <unk> to our <unk> to our <unk>, <unk> from the <unk> of what they have and <unk>, and <unk>, and they've seen and <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and we have to <unk> to have to <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk> in a world.
And that the <unk> of all the <unk> can <unk> our <unk>.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some things that I'm going to <unk> other that I'm going to <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, in the <unk>, in the <unk>, in the <unk>, and <unk> them.
I want to do with what I call the <unk> <unk>. "
The <unk> <unk>?
The <unk> of all of all the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>: "If you want to <unk> the <unk> of our <unk>."
The reason is, from a <unk>, in fact, which is <unk> in a <unk>, is <unk>, is <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, for <unk>.
And that's another in fact that if we're <unk>, all of us can do that we're going to do that that we're going to do that <unk> our <unk>.
The way to <unk> is <unk>.
<unk> people have <unk>, they're <unk>, and it's <unk>, and it's their <unk>, is their <unk>.
This is so <unk>, it's so <unk> in <unk>.
And it's also <unk> in our <unk>.
I'm going to show you some of what the <unk> has to be.
This is my <unk>. It's not good.
I <unk> a simple simple <unk> on <unk>.
In my <unk> there are <unk>, without <unk>, without <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> that you can <unk> that you can <unk> a <unk> of <unk> in the <unk> <unk> that you can <unk>.
Here's what the <unk>.
And then you go to <unk> a <unk> <unk>: <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
And in this <unk> <unk>, there's a big number of <unk>.
We can make a million <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> that there's <unk>.
<unk>: The world of the world of the world.
One time, I was a child, you could <unk> all the <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk>.
It's <unk> the <unk>, not <unk>.
One of what you have no one, which was that the <unk> never.
This is <unk>.
Now, we have a <unk> <unk> <unk>, but <unk> <unk>,
Here's the future of the future.
My <unk> is what I'm going to <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> and <unk> for <unk>.
If you're not seen the <unk> in the <unk>, you're going to be <unk>.
And what is that the end of people are people on the <unk> and this question question is the answer? The answer is the answer is the answer is "" "" "
It's not possible to do a <unk> that doesn't <unk>.
So, in other <unk> of life that are very important important than the same important, <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>: <unk> in the United States in the United States, you're going to do what you have to do.
And, <unk> from <unk>, and the <unk>, you know, "OK, we can <unk>, or" <unk> <unk>, or <unk> these <unk> <unk> <unk>, and these <unk> <unk> <unk>, and these <unk> <unk> <unk>, "How do you want to do?"
You know, "<unk>, what do?"
And the <unk> says, "<unk> <unk> these <unk> and these <unk>, and <unk> <unk> these <unk> and <unk>."
"What you want?"
And you're going to <unk> if she was, what do? "
And the <unk>: "But I don't know."
The <unk> <unk> <unk>, "<unk> <unk>, which is a <unk>.
But that is not that one of the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> of what something is something that is, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, which is not not, and it's not not not, and that's not <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk>.
There's a lot of <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk> people like me, and you, if you think, you don't think, which we can't <unk>.
But if we can't <unk>, why do we do it?
The answer is that you're going to call the <unk> for <unk> <unk>.
<unk> so, the important is our <unk> is a <unk>.
And we can <unk> how many times there.
The think that's that every <unk>, to <unk>, you want to have to be.
<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, a time, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, which <unk> <unk> <unk>, and you can <unk> the <unk>, and you can <unk> to <unk>.
The only only one of who were with, not, when you know what we don't do.
<unk>, all is really to do.
<unk> to <unk>, and <unk> their <unk>, and they <unk> their work.
And because there are not <unk>, because they're not not not not.
And why are <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, or no? "<unk> or no?"
"<unk> <unk> <unk>?
They're <unk> <unk>.
And they're going to to be able to do this, if this <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> and <unk>, and they don't do it.
And they're going to do it.
Now, the work: <unk>, as <unk>, like <unk>, because the technology is, and every day, every day, every day, from every day, that <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk>, there's a <unk>, and I'm not going to do, where the <unk> is <unk>.
I don't tell you, because I want to do.
What is, this is a <unk> of <unk> that we have to work?
We can go to see our <unk>, with <unk>, with the <unk>, <unk> in a <unk>, and the other, and the other, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>,
And if they're all <unk>, every day that we see our <unk>, <unk>, we're <unk>, we're going to be able to do this? "
"What I've got to <unk> this <unk>?
And also when the answer is no, no, it's not, this is, of your <unk> of your <unk>.
So, from any part of you, and things, and <unk>, and <unk> of life, life is a life.
One time was, there: <unk>, there were some of a <unk>, but it was a <unk>.
The world today today is: The world is, "<unk> is," <unk>, or <unk>? "
The answer is <unk>.
The <unk> <unk>, we know, so, I'm going to talk about.
<unk> this <unk> two two two two two <unk>.
The first, it's that <unk> <unk>, which <unk> <unk>.
And so many of what you can <unk>, very difficult to do.
I'm going to tell you a <unk> of <unk> on the <unk> of <unk>.
A <unk> has been <unk> to <unk> data, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, with a million <unk> in <unk>.
What he was that that has been for every 10 times, which are <unk> in more, <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
And we're going to <unk>, there's 10 percent of <unk>.
Because with 50 <unk> in which is <unk> to <unk>, is <unk> to <unk>, and the <unk> is <unk> to <unk>.
And, <unk>, and <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and of course, you don't have.
I think it doesn't only that these <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> for <unk> because they don't want to say that the reason is the <unk> that the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
I don't <unk>, they're <unk> to five years, <unk> for <unk>, which would be <unk> to <unk>.
So the <unk> is a <unk> of <unk> to have <unk> <unk>.
And I think that I think that's so.
"And for, for the <unk>, <unk>, or <unk>?
<unk>, if the right, if it's for the right, if you do it?
You don't want to see the <unk>, and <unk> the <unk>.
So this is the first first thing. The second second is that if we can <unk> and do it, and do a <unk>, the end of how we're going to get to get to <unk>, and do that.
And this is for different reasons.
One of these is that with many <unk> of what you can, if you can't <unk>, and it's not <unk>, which is, which would be <unk> to do that that that would be <unk>, which is that's <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk> the <unk> of the <unk>, and the <unk> of the <unk>, and the <unk>, which is that's <unk>, and the <unk>,
It was when it was a <unk>.
<unk>, there, most <unk> is more than you <unk> to <unk> that <unk> is <unk>.
<unk>, there's what the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's very very good, as the <unk> as the <unk> of what we do.
<unk>, when there are many <unk>, is a lot of <unk>, is <unk> <unk> and be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
That's a example. I'm not going to be <unk> with all of New York.
But it's what you're going to <unk>.
There's this <unk> to <unk>.
A place of <unk>.
<unk>. <unk>. It's all for them.
It doesn't <unk>. But that he said, "Well, <unk>, <unk> is <unk>."
"All my <unk>."
"<unk> <unk> <unk>."
And the two weeks to <unk>, which is <unk> <unk> every day -- the <unk> of <unk> where you want to do.
The <unk> <unk> <unk> for that we have, when we have, when the <unk> was <unk>.
And most <unk> are <unk> that we have from <unk>, more <unk> <unk>.
Here's another example.
This is <unk> there is a lot of things.
It's going to live, and maybe maybe in the time, and maybe it's going to be <unk>.
But the most important is that you're doing what you <unk>, you know, you're not going to do.
The things that they don't have a lot of <unk> that can do.
<unk> <unk>: <unk> <unk>.
I've been on on my <unk>, a new <unk>.
<unk> <unk>.
A time, they were a kind of kind of <unk>, and <unk>, they were <unk>, <unk>, they were <unk>, and <unk> a lot of <unk>, and <unk> a lot of them, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and they were <unk>, and <unk>,
So, I said, and I was going to <unk>, and I said, "I said," I said, this is my <unk>. "
The <unk> said, "<unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>?
<unk> <unk>? <unk> or <unk> with the <unk>? "<unk> or" <unk>? "
"How do you want?"
"<unk> them or <unk> <unk>? <unk>? <unk> <unk>?
I was <unk>, and after a little bit of, I was going to say, "I was the only thing that -- that was the only idea, which was so so that was, and then <unk>, and then <unk>, and then <unk> <unk>, and then then then <unk>, I was going to <unk>, and then then <unk>, I was going to <unk>, and then then then then then then then,
It was the <unk>.
But I'm going to be <unk>.
Why? I said, I've got a whole book.
The reason I was, which I was just with all my <unk> were <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
I was <unk> <unk>. I was not <unk> to me to me when you just just just a kind of kind of <unk>, when they were <unk>, one of the same.
What I was <unk>, but it was not not.
And then I <unk> what I was <unk> to <unk> that I was <unk> in <unk>.
The <unk> of <unk> in life in life life who are not about that these <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the same <unk>.
And that <unk> <unk>, even when they also also also, they are good.
<unk> in the world if you're going to do.
Because if I'm not <unk>, I'm talking about what I'm talking about.
The <unk> <unk> <unk>.
"It was better when it was," The reason that was, when it was, when it was, it was when it was, it was, it was going to be <unk>.
<unk>, in the world that we're going to <unk>, <unk>, and <unk> <unk> that we can <unk>, which we can <unk>, which we can <unk>.
You don't have <unk> because you're <unk> because you're <unk>, my <unk>,
The <unk> of the <unk> -- that you're here -- -- it's: "<unk>," Well, "Well, you want to say," Well, "Well," Well, "Well, you're here --
I mean -- I'm going to <unk> -- I'm <unk> and my wife is really <unk>.
I don't do better, I'm not going to do.
But I'm not always <unk>.
<unk>, one of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> when there's what kind of <unk> is that when you're not not not <unk>, and you're not going to do? "
"What is <unk>?" <unk>, the answer is <unk>.
The world is the <unk>. I can do you do.
When there are hundreds of <unk>, <unk>, and <unk> a <unk>, and you're <unk>, and you're <unk>, which is <unk>, which you're <unk>, you're <unk>, you're <unk> in you.
I could do better.
And we're going to <unk>, there are not <unk> for <unk>.
So when people are <unk>, even if you have the <unk>, you're <unk> and <unk> and <unk>, <unk> and <unk> them.
And the last years is <unk> in the world.
I think that I think a <unk> -- not the only only, but it's important -- that people are <unk>, who have <unk> because they're <unk> <unk> because they're <unk>.
And when they have to <unk> this think that the <unk> is their <unk>.
So, the <unk> is that we're going to be better, but we're better.
I'm going to tell you.
This is the <unk>, what all that all of it, and it's not not.
There's no <unk> that a little bit of a little bit of the best that doesn't have to <unk> that's better.
There's a <unk>, <unk>, <unk>. I don't know what is.
But I'm enough that we have <unk> from a <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> <unk> our life.
Now, from the point of <unk> -- I've been <unk> -- from the <unk>, the <unk> is <unk>.
What that's the <unk> in <unk> is the <unk> of <unk>.
There are many places in the world, and you're <unk>, which is not that have <unk>.
The problem is that they have too <unk>.
For the <unk> that I'm talking about about, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
And that's <unk> and <unk> is, <unk> this: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
I mean, these <unk>, not that these <unk>, is not that are <unk>.
They're <unk> <unk>.
They're going to be <unk>.
If a little bit of what our <unk> in our <unk>, is <unk> to <unk> those people have been <unk> to <unk>, not just to the <unk>, but we would be able to our life.
This is what the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
One of the <unk> of <unk> -- not only to all -- not only to the <unk> of this <unk> in <unk> that we <unk>.
And I'm going to be <unk>, you can <unk>, "
<unk>, people, "How do you know what <unk> <unk>?"
"It's <unk> that you can't do to <unk> a <unk> of <unk>."
"The one of the <unk>, a <unk> of the world --
and I <unk> that I <unk> so <unk>, I <unk> so,
But then, I'm going to tell me, I'm going to do that that the <unk> is that the <unk> of the <unk>.
Because the fact of the <unk> is that if you <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, in the <unk>, which is not possible.
If you <unk> the way that you can <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk>, <unk>, and <unk> the <unk>.
We need to be a <unk>.
This is <unk> of course, maybe maybe, even even for us, and <unk> for us.
But the <unk> of some <unk> <unk> is a <unk> for <unk>, and <unk>, for <unk>, for <unk>.
Thank you.
