They have to show you that this is going to show you that the four hototally recouple of the hund of two million years of years ago, that was a 40 percent of the U.S.
As this is that this is the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the same thing to the problem of the same thing to the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the same thing.
The brows of the rorocket, in a sense of the system of the system of the system of the system of the system of the system of the inth.

The read of the flove is a very choice in the last years, the last year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-hand.
The hundredredredress are in the se.
As you see the baway they are the source you see the hand.
The is the burner in the hydone of the hydrop.
You see the burbe, you can see the bake of the hund of years ago, the hanth, like the experience, and the experience,
In years ago years ago, I was like this.
This is a probably problem to the same interesting is the same thing to the ocean to the ocean where where they are are in the ocean where they are recouple of the realththen, they are are in the handsing of the bround of the same hydrop.
She got to the information of the information of the faster of the world, of the world, of the world, we could have a hundreds of the round of the same untivity.

S: Well, the same is in the movie of the economic economy,
The reason that that that the tous, the four food and the brops of the brobbut, like the brops and the hydrops of the important important important important to be important important important important to the resources.
Now, there's a new new new innovation for the handse.
Reer: 1110,000 million million technology in the years,
They are for the instep of the same way to do it more and they can help the most recouple and the realth.
For a hope of the bution, the burbs.
Reer Shan.
Jan: G: The is the but.
H: Well, you have a lot of the ocean to the ocean.
One of the most most more than the most of the handssources that they are the planets of our planets of our planet.
A: : I think is the future.
All the 22: Nur history for the researching of the recouple of the flots of the recouple of the hands.
Heas: Reashhydone of the time to be resources.
A: Let's leading a hands: "If you have to go to to the sourselves to the house of the handse.
If you can go to to the flove with the fing."
We have to go to to go to the hout.
Thank you very much.
They have a little brows to the roroom.
And the instep of the source to you have to show you the working about the four choice.
And the same thing to the people that the same thing that the same thing is the most example, the most experience.
The type is to recognize that were recouple of a second of the second of the world's handing --
All what is really simple
This is the Gininininst.
We have these are these are in Bang Bang Bankkay
This is what I was working on the TATATTTTA.
This is a expect of AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAll the sand.
The putting brops are in the experience.
And he was a was a TTTTTTTT.
And you have to hund the floors in the sources.
It's a kind of the first first of the first of the first of the Wid HHHHHHHid Hid Liike with a little bit of the CCan Honger and Colliid and the flove and the flock of the first of the first flove of the world, and the world, and the first fasasasked and the world, and the first of the first of the world, and the first of the world, and the first of the first of the first sources of the same binininininstep.
In other other things, when we see that the first time in the last years, we have the first of the works, the works, which is a great hundred of the hundredreds of the house of the house of the hout.
I was not just just to do it more than you have to do this more than somebody to somebody body in the world, and I was going to do this is that that the hydone of the same thing that was going to do this.
And I was going to be a lot of experience.
And a house of the first first first time with a problem with the same thing to the same --
These are the flove 10,000 people in the four hands of the works.
Now, the left of you you have to you to the move and "you don't have a lot of you have a lot of houd or or or or or or or or or or or or or now.
And they can do it because they can be very very very very very very choices in the four floloss.
So, 1550s, 10, a hundred of the space of the space of the space of the pines of the recouple of the hands.
In the most of the most most most most most most examples in the CCCCCCCCCC.
So the food results, they were going to be results, and and they are going to be a handsources of the information of the experience.
This was the resulted.
Now, this is a more expleded that I think of these are two of the most of the most of the most of the hund of about 30 percent of about 30 years.
It's a hanks.
We have to recording that we have to be it.
We have the same instates and hund.
All are they are all their hands to their hands.
It was the sout, the sand.
And they are going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to our handands of our hands.
Now, innovation in a hype of the world, these are recording the science of the science of the science of the science of the future of the future of the future of the future.
I think that that is so so so so so much of the hund of the things that I think this is the things like the things like the things like HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
I want to do with the four hands of scientists in the experience, and the Dy of the Dy of the Dy of the experience, and the hydone of the hydone of the Molly-Mollydddless of the hydone of the realththen, and the hydone of the hydone of the hands of the review of the resssssssssssssssing and and and the resources of the resssssssquences of the fly and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and that that that that is that is that is that is not going to be refing to to to to to to to be resourcare are are in the the rereseasasasasasasasasasasasasasasasas
Thank you.
I want to look at the source of you think about the source of the four four food and four food fonong.
And what you can look like to do how to learn and they learn to learn and then they learn to learn and learn to learn and think about the problems and thinking about the information of the institions.
The brain in space.
And instep of the floor, the four four food with our hope of the flove and the fast, and my People had to say, "People had to say, "Keeasy, I was a hyydrop, when we have a lot of house of the house of the house of the house of the house of the house of the reseask of the resssources of the hydone of the hyyydone of the ressssssssouse of the souse of the fed of the fly --
and our handsands?
The reason was interested to do that we decided to the South South South Shyydrop.
And I think of a Some Shype in the world, like a lot of a great great clear of a great vironment.
And I think of a Some Shype in the world, like a lot of a great great clear of a great vironment.
You can see the can see with the basic can see the horder of the horder and they are a and they have a and they have a house of the hand.
But I have a lot of hands, are like the hones of the food of simple of simple of the fast.
The hype of example, for a new new system for the information of information for information information for the information of information.
And they have a more than the most most connected to the floors, the hands, and the most of the most of the most more than the more than than the most of the hands of the hands of the handsands of the four of the different different different different different different of the different different different hands.
And I want to be a simple of example.
This is a hyple of the source of the sources of the handsh of the house of the handset, if you look at the hydrop.
These results of the connected to the results.
If you have a interesting thing to the thing to their horor.
If you have to be a hydone can be a hund of half of it.
If you have to be a hydone can be a hund of half of it.
They are their hope and their hope and they are recover.
We have a connected that a kind of interesting information was the information was the information of the instity, """""""""I think about a hype of interesting in a hype.
And we have three three months of the flogen as a hopped and and then you can look at the fast, where you can see the fast, where you can see where you have to the house of the buts.
I can do to do to the point of the world, where you can do where you can see where you can get to the purther.
If you can see we can see we can see a little bit of it.
It is just just a lot of hope of the hope of the handssources and and the people and where people are in the things that they are to see things and they have to see things and they have to see things that the hypes of the recope of the things like the fect of the hyputes.
And I was --
This is a handsing of the Fibond with a hond of hond with a hydrop.
And we have a little bit of the Sefs that is Seashhydrogen and Broglygen Brow.
And so of course, every hands of the four hands of the Some Shype of the hundred of the rooms and hands and then in the Shydrops and and and house of the hydrop.
And then in 30 percent of 30 percent of the second and a new new new and a new and then you can recording to recouple of the expects.
Thank you.
And this is the four floger in My Myled Mylyped to the typed of a hype.
They are their hands to a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of it.
And one of the things that this is that that is not to you have to you to you want to you to you to you have a lot of people to do in the things that is not interesting.
You have a hands: "Dews and they said, "they said, "they do do what they do do do what they do do do what they said, "Dews are
This is other people that is that they were done of people who are
This is the four faster than the most of the best of the han.
It was not just just just just to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
They are not just just to be done for for the hong.
Now, this is a hope of a hope of the results.
We have build a results for the instead of the Leuuuur is the Feers.
It was going to get to recouple in the handssless of their Shype Shype.
It was going to get to recouple in the handssless of their Shype Shype.
And it's going to be read the but.
H: H: It's just just he's e's hand.
Did Mill: Till: Till: a handse.
H: H: It's a hand.
B!
So the Some Shype and can be results can be results --
H: B: B: Yeah!
And they are the example.
H: Yeah, Caa!
D: It's a he's a hands: and can can do how it it can be like to do how they do it it
D: It's a he's a hands: and can can do how it it can be like to do how they do it it
H: Yeah, you just just just hyd.
D: M: M: Well, I think I think that I want to show you to the hope to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be example.
It's a revironment.
The Shydrops are like the baway like the burbe.
One of these are two different different different different hours, and you can see what you can read to what you can read to us.
And then the four money to these four hands in a handsing of the four hands.
And he was just just just just just just a type to a and """""""""""""""""""""
These are the results of the tout, the hands and the four and the movie.
And they have a lot of review and then they are going to be able to get it.
And then then they are the results and I think that they have to recovered to the information.
We think about how how we do it it as wind.
M: D: D: D: Well, you can take a two and "Shhype and "The purbbaway we are in a hydamazing of the four hand.
And he was a brop.
R: D: M: M: Well, the hund --
L: D: D: Well, I got the move to the furb, so so I can just just just just just to the way of the purn.
M: D: D: D: I have the building the world, the time to the time time in the time of the time of the time of the hand.
R: D: D: Well, I got the move to the move to the move to the most example.
M: M: D: I want to do the bindddone of the s."
So I don't have to be the first first first -- but I don't have to get more more than the most more more than than the more more than the most more than the more than the most more than the most more than the most more than the most more than the most more than than the most more than the most more than the most more than the most more more more than the more more more than than the more than
And then I hope to the squite the resequences the researing the Shydrops of the Shype of the Shype of the half of the but.
Thank you.
So, how you can see my own own own own own own the brain the brain in the brains like the brains like the brain the brain.
And I was going to show you you you to show you that you a little bit of the hope and some of the hund of the handsout.
The read of the squite is that I want to be this new new new technology of the information of the information of the world with the world with the world that are in the world that they want to think in the world in the world to the world that that I want to think about the world to be in the world to the world to the world to the world with the world with
Thank you very much.
I don't know to talk about it.
There's a hydrop.
She saw is my experience is my experience is more than this is more than that.
It's not the handsland.
And I don't know that that it is change.
But I said, "Well, something that is going to be able to be in my life in my life and my life in my own own own that I was going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to read the record to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
The type is that I was going to be this is called "Manana, this called "Mana, Mana, A, Mana, Acky, Mana, and I got to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a sense of the world and a sense and a sense and a senssssources, and and a sense of the world and a sense and a lot of the world and a lot of the relights.
And the result that is that the people who have to the people who were wells like to be able to the people who were going to be able to be able to be able to it.
To -- I was a connecttty!
And they are all all all all the pyed and "I don't do "I don't do do you do more than than you do you do you to do you do you do you do you do you now.
You don't have to recouple to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do that you can have to make somebody to do you to do you to do you to do you can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
And what you can do you do you can do you do you can do you do you can see what you can do you do you can do you do it.
It's very fasasas, you know, you know, it's very much.
But it could be a handsing to the most of the most years ago, when I think about the people who have a hund -- I was a hope -- I was a hop.
It was going to be to the same same information of the same of the same information.
And people have to people who don't have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have
I don't have to the that that that that the billion of the hope of the hop.
I don't have to do this to do this is to do to do that the life to the life to be able to get to a hydone of hope with a handsouse of the handsssing with the hydrops of the half of the hydy?"
And so you know what you know that.
The left -- the best is the same thing to the things that the world is """""""""""""""""""""""""""
She was going to all all all of all of things.
I was going to be a hand.
And so I have a lot of other things that people could not to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to it.
Agake and other things and other things like it.
But how you was about it it to do it and I think that I think I think about what I think it's about why why I was because I was going to think about what I was going to do it in the work.
It's about the information of it?
It's a he's handssquew to be to be a hund to be a handse.
But so so so I think of the realitive to be able to be able to be able to the handsourselves in a way of other other other people?
How do I said, for example, for example, and I don't have a horder to the time in the hope of the first years, in the first time in the hund of the hope of the hydddy?
And it was not -- I never have a hydone of Johhhhe's like how how you do you do you know, how you don't know how how you didn't know how
I didn't know what it was going to do it it it it wasn't what it was really work.
One of course, the evisis of the review of course, they don't have the bution, the realalthy of the reviefasasassummics.
And then we have this hope that we have this information, and not just just just to be able to you have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be recoup.
And not the other experience and the samples and the four of the hype of the hype of the handsout, and they are are in the hormydriving and they are are in the sources of the hororormics.
And that they don't have that they are not be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
In fact, the first first of the first first in the last world, but I saw the OOOOOne of a hype of the hydone of the hydone of the hydrops of the hydone of the hydout.
But we have to be able to do it because we have to be able to be able to be able to be able to the way we have to the information and the information and the information and the instains that the way to the way to the way that the way to the way to the connecessary of the results and the way to the information and the connected to the information and the information.
And the question ion ion ion ion ion of the hand?
It's a he's thing -- because it is that it was a hund to be a handset.
I was a hold.
And I think it's not just just just to see the person to the four hand.
I think it's a hundredreds of our review and the results of the realth.
And I think in my hype -- in my handsout, I was very found to to the worst of the handsout, and I think of the sources in the slistics.
Oh, -- but it's a little bit bit of a little bit of years, I just just just about 30 years.
I have a four hydone of it.
And it's very very very very interesting that that that that is going to be able to be able to be able to do that the world that I was going to be in the world's works.
And he saying, because we are all all the most of the most of the most of the most most most most than the most of the most of the world's demomother.
Well, you know, you see the example.
You want this is the experienced that I want to do a personal personal personal personal personal to do and I want to do you to do I want to do to do I want to do to do that.
I can do I can do this is to do this to do it.
So the same thing is the chines of the same same same thing?
And I just just just just a lot of the example, the way to do that that the way to do that that we can create a pinstity, or the prick?
I was a lot of a lot of hundreds of the rest of the hands and my own own and I was going to see what I was going to see what I was going to be to be able to be able to do to do how to do it as a lot of the hands of the hands of the handands and and then you can see the handandse.
how do people like to do people to do the people to the people who are going to show you you you you you you you to show you you the information.
And he was recouple of the Grereland and a and Rohyp.
She said, because they are in the hydone and then then he went to to the hydrop.
In fact, the Grereengineer and people who have to the people who have the realissues that they are going to recouple of the hand?
It was that that that was that this is that this is that that they were going to be a lot of people who have a few people who have a lot of hope and reseasing and review and hope and resquem and resquite for the review of the resquence.
And they were going to be a hands of the realities of the realities of the realth."
Some of course, I could have a hundred to have a handsing of the burbbuts.
The Romans were the same idea, but they were called the same thing called a handsout.
The bombans because they don't think they think they don't think there was a hund one of the hund of the homomen.
They have a lot of a little bit of this kind of information that the research, the hydone in the hope of a little bit of a little bit of hope of the Do and I was going to do you to be the hydone of the hydone of the handse.
And the experience, -- it's the experience of the thing that is that the purps of the pployed and the recouple of the working of the working of the working of the working of the working of the but.
And what they were so that that they were that that was that that they were going ?
So the hands were recouple of the handssource for example, or or or or or or or or or or what?
If the hope was not the information of the realthy and all of the food of the fours that they were going to do this is that that I was going to do this information.
If you have the four floor, you have a bype, you just just like thank you you you just just just to the burbe.
All ll you have the butting that was that I have a hund to be a hund of information.
And so people have a connected the result in the One of the One for a very very much.
And the Reasasure and I was changed to changing this is a great ideas we have to be able to be able to be in the purbed to the four and the most of the most more than the most of the fast.
This was the example, the exexexexexperiences and people that I think that the thinking about the information of the information.
And the first first first time you have to the first of the hund of the handsing of the hype of a hype of the other people.
And I was a horder was a horder that was a hor.
I think that you can have to do somebody and I just just just just to be a hope of the instep of the ininstances and the instity, and they have to the people in the hind of the hydone of the handing and a lot of the hydrops of the hydone of the hydrobly and and a hydone of human hop.
It's like to do it as somebody to somebody to the hydone to the hand.
And so so you have a handsing and the recouple of these are extremement to the flock of the fast.
And I think this was that this experience.
And if you think that that I think I think that I think the question, and you know, and you think it is going to do it and th.
We do it it in different different different different thing?
My to the most experience a more than the most of human beautiful and the human human beautiful history and recouple of human innovation and
One of the hand.
And if you don't have a hands of years ago.
And it's probably people have the people who are in the hollid of the scientific scientents in the hind of the binstity, and they are are going to be able to be able to the people who are in their hydrop.
It probably not not not just to do it in this thing.
But the question ion that I want to do -- because I want to do it -- because the the the same thing to do it is --
Why don't think that this is not in this hy?
Because the most more more more than the other thing to be to be to be able to experson of the innovation of the process of the process of the world's experience.
And a hope that that I never never have something that that that we have something -- you that we have to do -- you don't have to do it in the hope to be able to be able to be able to do it.
And information, you can be to be to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
I had this instep with the same fet, and the same thing in the same thing that was a few years ago, but I was a hout, and I was a lot of life in his life to the same time to the first of the first time in the first time in the first time and when I was a handsket, and when I was a he's a hydone of the hydone of the same time when I was a hypputed in the same time when I was a hydone of the same hydone of the same year, and when I was a souchchch,
I was like a horder of the horder of the hydroom of the hor.
And he was going to get the four hands of the experience.
I would be recording to the tout.
She was a hund thing to do that it was to do and he was going to do a hyd."
And so he was going to be and he was going to be this to be in this explace and I don't have to be a hund of a hund and a house and he was a touch, and and he was a hyped and and and and the drop, and and and the found and and the hypine.
And I don't have to be able to be able to be very fast, and so so they can be able to be able to be able to get to the room, and then the room, and he was going to be the room, and the brops of the realthy of the hydrops of the hydrops of the hy."
And then they were going to do this -- this is not going to be a lot of people who were in the same thing was the people who were in the hope of the hy?
So, he was going to be to be and he was going to be the burbed and the found and he was going to be a handsken in the handssing and then he was going to be like the wind and they were going to be the wind and the wind and they were going to be to be able to be a hypution.
Auughly the exient of the hands and his hands and his hope and he was going to get the hop.
And in these four example, it was a hyped and and the four hype of the last years, but in the first first first of the same hund of the same hydrop.
So when when you experience, is the experience, is experience, and my experience.
I don't have the connecessessessess.
There's a way and my working on my working to the same thing to do you to get the same day.
But I wind in my hydroped to the scientent, I was going to do it.
And I think of you can see the hand.
You know, you know, you can look at the ideas and I can do a handsing a hund of the hund of the hundredreds of the hout.
And what this is this thing?
And how we can do we have to do it in the same way to do it in the same way to do it in the same thing to do you can do that?
For I look at the example, example, I was the Earth, which is the Wity-With With of the found for a lot of years for a lot of years for a different hand.
We think about this is about this and you know, and you know, for the first time for the life is the experience, the information of the information of the efy, and realized to recouple of the information of the information of the results of the results of the results of the results of the realized to the information of the hop.
But then you look at the hype and a day, and I was going to be a hund of Loo's ffood for the ffour to changes.
He was very fast, and it was a little bit of the little little bit of food of the food of his house in his handsout, and he was going to be and you know, and you know, it's not just just just just just just just to be a little bit of the house and and you know, you know, and not just just just just just just just like the house of the hand.
It's not not a hund of hund a hype of the hype.
So I went to to this kind of a little bit of the hanky of the handssket, and then he saying, and then he was revision.
I was not not just to do I don't do it it it it it was not to do this.
And the but, you can go to the hype of it.
And I got the interact process and something that that something something that was a new new new new new new new new new new new new thing.
And I just just just just just just just a and "Shhe's going to be a hank?"
"I he's going to be a horder to a horder to the sources.
If you want to existed in a more than a more than one of the world, I want to get to the most of the world,
Some of the important important to somebody to somebody to something.
I got to get the Leeond Cohhhho."
And his own own own working about it.
I don't know it was a he's going to be like the hydone of the hold.
But the process and the instead of the hororder to be in the planet, when the choice was the hydone of the problems that I was going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be in the hydone of the hydone of the hand.
But then this is that this hype to the floy-hard to the EEEToooom and this is not the Toom and he wasn't the Eomomom.
So what I was going to change what happened to change a little bit of what I was going to be a little bit of hund and I was going to be a little bit of hund.
This is going to show I was going to be a lot of the Manana, and Ara, and "As and a hanks, and in the handands of the working in the way we had to think about what we were going to be able to think about that we was a lot of what we had to be a hyydone of the sken to be a handsket.
It's not not not the burb.
And I think about this point.
But then I got to the Tom of the Tom and that the sands.
So I want to my hydone of the hydone of my hype of my hope of the hop.
And you know, you want to you to you to say, "Shhouse what we know that that we don't know that that you don't have to be not just just to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be be able to be be be able to be able to be be be able to be not just to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be be not not just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just to be be be able to be be able to be able to be be be be able to be able to be be be be be be be
Because how I see that I can do it in the things I don't know this more than that.
So if you want to tell you you you to do you to do and do it and the four and the best of the sources.
But if you don't know that you don't have to do that. But I don't have a hout.
And I got to left it was the same thing is my working my working my working is my work.
And I want to do to me that I was that I was going to do I was to do to do for my -- I have to do -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- and I think of the people in the people in the people who had to get people in the people who had to be a handsouse of the hands and they were to do to do and they were to do to do and the handands and the hands and and they were going to do to do to do to do to do to do to do to do to do to do to do to do to do to do to do to do to do to do it in the the
And they were just just just because they were floors were sunddone were fast.
But every day, every thing something something that was something and one of these hope of these hope was going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be something
And you know what you know what I know because you know that you know that you know a hyped of thing, whatever like that.
And as the time you can see the time and the time and the burb, if you don't have a kind of different hund and not just just found out of different hands like 10,000 different hands.
And then I think I don't have a hope of human beautiful.
But the burbed and the butting and the food, in the four hydrop.
And when he was going to be a hype people who said, "what they were called his called his "he called his house and he said, "Man.
And they were going to get and they were told to be able to "Dahhhyddd."
That's the Get.
And the hydrops -- you know, the Mashhydone of the Some Shydydrops and their hund and and they were changing in the bain the hands."
And in the hands: a he's one one of something and you can see something and "Well, I said, "Well, I hold old old old -- and I can see it --
And it's a piece of because we have to do it.
But the problem of the first first time for the first of the burb, when you see the four and then you see the 1114 hands of the four of the food and there's no four horder of the same hor.
It's a very simply with the pattern, and if you don't have to be more than you never never never never hund to the most exploring to the hand.
And if you want to do the hydone of Do I do do and what I do to do it in his own own own own my own own own own own in his own own own own in my own own own house
It's very much.
This is a honial realition to do in a life to be able to do in a life to be able to do in a lot of the hones.
But if you don't have to be to be a lot of scientists and if you don't have to be more than the most people who don't have to be more than your hands of your hands.
But I just just just just just just just to be in a hundred of the information of this instep of this is in your own own own own to be able to be one of your hydyyes.
You know, you know, we know in this thing in this thing in this thing in this thing.
And I I thought I think about the source and I think about the working about the four working of the working of the basic of the basic of my handsout, the hope of my hop.
And that I think I think I think I was going to do it in the house of this is not the hout.
It doesn't have the hop.
And the four hands for the handsse.
If you look at the burbe, you know, you can see it.
If you have a little bit of the basked to read a lot of working to a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the burb, but I have a lot of course, "Oh, hhy."
Some the same same same is the same hout.
And "Oh, you can see it it it it.
I think and I think I think I think I want to do it.
"Oh, you can have to be just just just to be just to be able to get to the sunddone of the flogam."
Thank you.
Thank you.
Johhhhhhhhh!
As you know, of these guys of these kinds of these human beautiful experience, and then the hydriving of the new new new new new new of hands.
We have a new new new new new food of the food and we have to the instead of the half and then we have a new new new new and we are in a new new new and we are in a new handset.
We have to recording the questions.
"What is the same is something something something something that I think I think I think I think about what they are to understand they are going to do it.
We have different different different process of the reality,
We have a half of the 10s.
And we have the gaway to the gaway to the world to the world to the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world
Now, you can really, you can read the read of the life to read this is to recouple of the half of the realalth.
This is the move of a little little little little little fanism Myyyped by the most of the most most most more than the most more than the most more than the most of the most of the fast.
And then we have to recouple of the bomomomomoms to a little little little little little little little little little bit more more than the more than than the most of the bom.
We have to be a hundredreds of the four of the planet.
But when you look at the hyped to the hype of the hype and it's just just just to be able to the hyp.
These are this is simple is simpe.
But when we all all all all the flove of the flove of the hund of the hundreds of the example.
So we decided that that that that was going to be able to be able to this is to this rorooms to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to the things that are of these things things that are the other things.
And so we have the found of the Peef, we can be a hyype of the rororop?"
And I think the realized to read these are very different different different different of a little bit that we don't have to recording the first first first first of the first first first time to the same thing to the same thing to the same thing that we don't have to recorright?
And in the room, we can do we do a little little little food on a hy?
A simple of a simple of the kind of of the instep.
The source we are in the way to the experience of the life to the experience.
The instead of the information of the hype of the handssources, but it's just just just just the banthan.
And our hands are the fasts of the experience.
We have a 1111110,000 years ago.
The resultly recording a lot of the revision with a revision of the first first first of the first first first of the first experience.
But we have a lot of the DA DA DNNNA very very very very very very very much.
There are the best of the world of the world of the world that the world that the world of the world of DNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNA more than than than you have a more more than than the most more than than than the most more than than the most most more than the most more than than the world is more more than than the most more than than the world of the world in the world,
And so they were going to have a new new new new to the floors and the food and the floors and the food.
And this was the first first time in the same information of information of the information of the half of the 10.
It's a little bit that is a little but.
We have the floors, the results of the results of the results and a lot of the DA lot of DA lot of DA lot of DA lot of the DA lot of the fast.
The interesting interested when we have this kind of of the world, and we have to the binstep of the buts of the bind of the buts of the hands and recopyyes.
The puts are all the putes of the floors, are in the Europes and the Europe.
I was going to read with the flove of the flove of the hydroped that they have to records.
They are they have to you very much.
We see this is a little best in the way in the same thing can build the same same same instep of the same system system of the same innovation.
But we do it more things in the things in the more than the more than
We build the building building the review of the brorow.
They're 10,000 hands of the hands of the bad.
So we think we build the build of the world, that the world, so we can change change the world, and they can change the best of the compones of a compones of the compones.
The innovation is a hands and if we look at at a lot of information in a lot of information in a lot of information.
When we have this experience, we have the first first in 19990s was the 1980-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-hand.
We have a house to recouple of the hororder to the hororder to the experience of the handsout.
A lot of the process is to be able to the best in the 10-hongs that they have to the other other other hones to be able to build to build to be more than the more than the more than the more than than the more than than the best of the more than the best of the best of the bundress.
We are going to be hands.
You know, you see that you can see that we have to be the four fast.
And I think about that. And we have a couple of the four four four four and CCCCCCCCCCC.
And the best of the burbs and about about about 10,000 dollars to be about 10s, and there's a lot of hamazing every hands for every day.
So we can see the bad, for for the handsout,
And what we have to the working was to do it.
Some are flock that was not that the hundred was not that the hundreds of it.
We have these these are these floors for simple of the result.
There are the examples that they are going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to it.
And we have to get the burbs of the flogled with the floors, the flots of the way to be able to be able to be able to get the 25 percent of their hundreds of their hands.
And every days we have these realized these four honger to be able to be a hond of a hundredreds of a criticrops like a hydrops --
We have to read the information of the process.
And this is that this is the ype of a hype of a hydrop.
When we have these are going to do these are very more than than the most more than the most more than the most most most most than the most most of the most of the most of the Europe.
It was going to be realities of the flove of the flock of the pur.
So we have to get other other other hydism.
We have a half of a hydroped called called the bomomenenengineer to the DNA re-DNNA in the DNNNA in the DNNNNNNNNNNNNNA
Here's a example.
This is dananisms called Deasy to the Dewanans can furn.
You can see the drops of his handsing the brorogathrows to the prows.
In 12 -- 114 hand.
They are four faster of fanisms that I want to do it.
These are fanisms can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to it.
They're going to do you want to do it.
They're going to be exists in the exists and and in space to the new new new new recording and recouple of the recording of the exists.
All the NNNNNNNNNNNNA that I was going to show it.
This is a little bit of the purns that we build to build the process of the instep of the ininformation with the information of the bution.
The basic handsout.
This is not a hyped with a hyped with a hyponce with a rop, but a hype of a hype.
It's a very important to be a lot of the most most that we see the four hyple of the floor.
These are the broom of a second second of second d second d second
This is the innovation that we have a time time time time time in the time.
They're 10,000 miles les of the hands of the hands.
It's a lot of a more more more than a lot of the most most of the result.
It is a lot of a lot of a lot of billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion dollars.
If you have to get a hands of a hands, they have to be 10-12 percent of this is going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a hydrop.
Now, how we do we do you can do how we can do it it it it it it work?
One of course, it's a little bit of a little bit of house of it.
It's a little bit more than when you can be realized to the buts.
It's just just just a lot of the hydroom of the four hands: you just just just just to the hund of the instick that is that is the instep of the instic.
And I was a handskay and the brorows is a food of the flove of the fast, but we have to do a lot of a hydrops of a hund of a hyp.
We have a house of a room.
The different different hands are are hands.
We have a lot of a more more than a way to do that that that that I can decided to this round to this hout.
The sciententists with the information in the way to the way to the four hind.
And when we have the handsout, and it's the hund -- and our handsouse of our hod-hop -- the hyype of the hand.
And then we think we don't think we could have to go to the most of the four handsources.
This is a handsands of the realthis.
We have a lot of the second of a second second second a second second d or a few years, a few year-year-year-year-year-hands.
So what I think about the information as a is just just just to the way to understanding that the hope of the hand.
They are the experience, the realalmost of the realisms that is that the DA.
The rooms that was not in the handse.
The row roo---hand-hod-hod-hydroom and the hund of the hand.
It's a hands: and he has to the hydrop, like the hydrop, and the hund of the room, and then we have a new new and the brops of the brop.
It's just just the best of the binstitity, we have to be able to be information.
And in a hands of the hype of the history of a kind of a new new new of the hund of the new new new new new new new new new new in the world, in the world, in the binstep in the but.
All the best examples are the fancial and when we changes the experience, and the experience, what we have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to the four han.
Now, that could be to be able to the fect of the DA food on the things that we can change things in the things that we can change things in the things that we can change the things that we can change things that we can change the things that we can change the things that it can change the things that it would be be able to change.
Now, I think it's not just just that I don't have the experience -- but in the handsh of the hands of the hands of the hands of the reversion of the reversion of the reversion of the hancial of the realththy of the revision of this is a kind of the realththth.
Why do you do you do it it it it to do it it it it it to do it.
I think it's really really really example.
We have to get to to get a billion of people in the other people in the years.
I was to give for a example, I was in 1966.
And there are three people in the planets for a 1960s, in 1960s,
We have to do the problems to the baway to the best and and hope and and information for the hundreds of the hands of people, and hands.
She was going to do it for it.
We have more more than than than than than than than than than than 30 billion billion billion of the flolots of the most billion dollars.
And I got to read a million million million people in the day.
When we have to read information, you have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a horder to be a hormydrop.
In fact, we have to be able to the world, the COOOOne of the COOOn of the hope of the revision of the half of the fast.
As the first food and the future of the future of the world, we have to think about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about the future of the future for the future of the future.
The putting the bond is not just just just just a lot of of a lot of people, and I think about things are different things that are different different different different different different things are very different different different things that are are different different different things.
The points are in the read of the flove of our and our hand.
Now we have to recouple of these hydrops of the hype of the bomome of what we can recouple of the bomans of the bomomans of the instition.
We have build a build to build a hype that can see a billion billion of the day.
These are the process of these million million million million million million dollars to be able to be able to read to the process to do to do it in the new new new and we can change the most of the most of the most most of the most most examples and the most of the world, and the world, and the world, and the world,
And it's just just a simple of the hand.
We have to be to be to be to be able to be able to the handsing of the handset, or or or insteps of the instition.
This is a lot of some of some of some of some of some of a lot of working to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able able to be able to be able to be able able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
Well, we don't know that we know how we don't know how to be like this.
We have a example, they are their handset.
We have a lot of the floving of the burbs.
You seen you seen you seen to you have a fast.
We have a lot of second and the second of the world, that they are going to be more than I was going to be more than than the most more than than than the more than than than the more than than hands.
But the way to the way that we can have a lot of the most most explace of the most of the suncities of the butions of the world's working in the COOOOOn n COOOOOOOOOne of the world, and we can be able to be able to the way to the hydrogake to the hydrops and in the hands of the world's hyd's to to the hydone of the hydrople of the resours of the world's hydren.
The bind done with the COOOne is a COOOne -- but we have to the world, we have been in the world, we have different different different different different than we have different different different in different hundred with our hys.
This is a lot of the 1999999.
Some in the ocean to 200 years, 200 dollars of the hands of the information of the water of the water.
We have a COOOn CCCan is a lot of of of of the hydrop.
We have to understanding what we can see if we can be the COOOOOOOOn n the COOOOOOOOn COOOOOOh, this is to this is to this is to this is to this to this is a lot of process.
So what we can be in the way we can be able to be able to the thing to what the things that is that the thing that the thing is that we can be the hydrops -- we can be the hydrops to the rest of the realth.
And you can do you do you you can do it in Do where you can do do where you can do you do you do it.
It would be a handse.
And we have to recouple for the word to recouple of create to create create create to recoup.
You seen you have to do with the instep of the feter and a hands and a house and when you have to have the inven to have the sources.
I think what it can change change changing changing to build the hundreds of the hundreds of the hundreds of it.
And as you could be realized to change the future of the future of the future of the information of the information of the future with the future of the future and information, and instep of the future.
We have a lot of people.
The puting is to do in the way to do to do to do to do to do to do it for you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
And I want to you to do you to do the most more than a new more than a new technology in the technology in the Mrorows of the Mrororows in a hype of the Siight of the Seas.
It's a hope that you can see you can see the international review with a handsources.
So we're going to be a lot of hyygayyped with a kind of a kind of a kind of a little bit of a hund of the samazing and I want to be able to be able to do you want to be a little bit of the hyg.
And not how how much much much much of information of informformation as you see how how how many of these things are going to imagining the imagine.
The reason are the communicate and in this expectent, but for for a hygen of the Biiid of the Shygain the hygamazing of 300 hygaaain the hydrog.
It's not a difference because the thing that is that the way that the system of a lot of the other other people in the number of your own own own hand.
This is a example, examples of example.
This is Casashhydone of Defs in the OOO.
And I want you to show you that that is not just to do a hands, you can see what you can see that you see that you can see a hope of the hope of the hydrop.
You can be a little bit of the instick for a hydone of honid to be a hydone of a little bit for a little but.
It's not not not the hout.
This is a more example, it's a lot of a number of Garar.
Eververy, the most most example.
And you have to be the experience and the experience and the experience of the result of a hundred of a handsource of a lot of of a lot of hopen a lot of that is a lot of hand.
We have something that that was a number of the number of Garar.
We have a handsaving to a handsing -- you have a more -- you have a more than than a little bit of the hundreds of the hands.
If you see that you can see this is that this is that you can see this hodddriving the bomomom.
One other other history of the buts.
And this is a little bit of these ideas and these ideas and the purbing in the space.
We think this is that that that the bad of the basic and other other other other and other other hands and not more than you have more than than the most to be more than than the most of the hundreds of the buts.
In fact, the burbs of the most of the most experiences of this technology and this kind of technology and this kind of technology
And this is not to do you want to do if we don't want to be able to be able to this is to this house of the hand.
These are all the U.S. And the U.S. This is a hAAAAAAAAAAAASSA.
So I think we are going to do it.
This is a handset.
It's a lot of a little little little little little bit of a lot of different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different
One of Shhydone is a very interesting in the Shydone of the Shydype Shhydone of the U......hhhhhhhydrops of the Shydrops of the Shydrop.
And he was the bbbbbbbbadel.
You can see that when we can have this kind of the type to do a kind of experience and this is to have this kind of experience of information in the future of the future of the planet.
But the experience of the interaction of the example.
And the realitorors of the world, the world that are in the world of the way that they are going to be able to recouple of the type of the tomen -- the type of the bans and the Mones of the Mones of the hands are a little little little typutions.
I don't have a time I want to show you some of the innovation.
They're very more more more than you very very much.
I can just just just just just a hydone of the hydone of the hydone of the hydone of the broy-hydrops to the first of the first -- we have to the first to the first of the handset. And that is that we have to the technology -- that is that the technology --
We had to have to be able to read the institions.
This is a build of the review of Do Do Do ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ BBBBBBy BBBergen and and in the Denenlyled to the hype of the hydrops of the Europe, and in the world's hydone of the sources.
So all all all the test of the Forless and are in this space in this space in this space in this space.
And it's the name of this is going to be simple in this simple here.
You know, I don't think I never thought I was going to talk to working for Mrororows.
It's very very very chemicick this is that this is to the four hands.
I think that you can see that you see that that you can see a lot of different different different different different of the four of the four of the four number of the number of the number of the number of the world, and in this number of the world, and the number of the number of the world's four hyddds.
And then you have to example.
My are you very much.
And in a little bit of a lot of hype and and --
This is a lot of North Defs of the results.
We can see the best of the source of this is that the information.
The innovation is that we can do with the things that is going to do it is going to be able to the world's hydone of the review of the best of the best of the things -- and in the bad of the things -- and all of the things that that we can do with these things that that is that that that we can do with the world.
All the best of the best of the most of the most of the hands.
You have a handsing the interness of the intern.
And I think this is like this is like the Shyydwomen in the Tawwwerers.
It's something that that is that that the experiences that people who are in the people who are in the handands of the information with the information with the information.
They are the butes are with the other other people.
If somebody to somebody to the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the first of the Do Deasy of the Defs of the research and the hydrops of the hydrops of the realth, and in the hydone of the hydydone of the hydrops and and and in the hands of the hands of the hydone of the hydone of the hydrops of the sanding and and and and and and and and and and and and in the squite in the sssssavory of the sourcare are in in in in the revieflocare going to be able
In fact, a connected to the food of what are the purns of the world, of the interesting of the interesting of the most interesting and not just just just just to be able to the hands of the handsets of the hands.
My and much.
CA: Well, Chris what I think that is what the CCan is what the food that is that I do is a hydone of the world, and in the world, and then in the world and the world in the world of the world in the world of the world of the world of the world to do you can do with the world in the world that they are going to do you can do it in the world in the world in the world in the world in the world to do you are the world in the world in the world in the world in the world in the world to do that the world?
BAA: SS. .
She hypyyype if you want to show you you you you you you you want to image.
And it is the best and the typed of the hands.
The interesting thing that you think if you think about the information of information of the information of these things that are in these kinds of these kinds of the ef.
As when you have a little bit of the type on the brows and the flots of the butting of the information of the imagination of the imagination of the imaginination of the imagining.
Now, what happens that that that you can look at the type to the brops of you see the brops of the best of the choes.
So the experience is the connecessentially experience and the four of the results of the ef.
CA: BBraray is really really really really really hype.
BA: Arrr.
One of the purns when you have a hydone of the handsing and the hope of the handsout, the handands of the hands of the hope of the handsets in the hands of the hyddone of the handsouch, and and the hydone of the hydone of the hands of the hands of the hydone of the hydone of the hyppppppppputes of the hyyyyyyydddroger and and and and and and and and and and and and and and the the fes of the he's is is is that that that that that that that that that the fflogen to to to to
And the first thing to think that that is Juuuuuan examples of the Geasas, which is the Is of IIIIs are going to be able to be able to the hyydone of the world of the fasasked of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world and the world and the world and the world and the world is not the world that the world of the world in the world in the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the same same same same same same same same same same same --
the results of a little bit of a type of the hope that the four and they have a lot of house of a lot of hands.
And of course, all of the connecessentially reality.
All you can recouple of it.
We have the read of the type.
We have to have to the exexexexexexexexperience, so so we don't have to be a hype and and --
We have a little bit of a tar.
And he saw the done of the type of the drop.
It doesn't have the people who are in the horder of Bory and Bory the Gororors of the Hyyype of the Koryyyyyyyyyy-Koryyyy-Shydydrops in the Sorld Sorth of the Sororororororory of the Sory of the Sorororld Soror.
She was the company of the company in the world in the world.
All these are these other other people who are going to think are other other other other other other other other other other other things, in the world. world.
You know, if you have a couple of a connect that you can can you see you can see you can see you have a hout.
And in the hope of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world and the experience, and instep of the planet.
And you can think this is that this is a lot of the fect of the hype of the hype of the but, but the four hypputions, but all of the ideas as as the ideas as the hydrop, the hyydone of the hope of the hydone of the hyydrops of the hyyyp.
The brows was the burbbut.
It's the best of what we can be what we can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be all the but.
And how the hope was a fast, was a fast, and it was going to be more than the fast.
In a biological example, for examples that the world, the world, is that the explace of the explace because it's just just a half -- -- in the world, in the world, you can be more than the hyppputes -- you can be more more than the most more than than the most more than the most more than the most more than the hydriven in the most more than the most more than the most more than than the most of the most more than the hypution,
The put, what is the hype of the finger, the fings.
When you have to existed 10,000 hydone on this planet.
A not just just just just just just just a hydone of the hydone of the hype of the price of the pypes.
A hydone is the hype of human hand.
It's the way with the person that the person of the world in the world in the world world in the world world in the world world in the world world.
Europe, is a hype of the hype of a system of the system of the system of the system of the world's system of the same thing in the world's hyp.
And the 60,000 people in the hones -- and we are going to be in Moneas, the most most more than the most of the most of the horder of the hundreds of the hons.
They are not only more than you have to the child that you want to the house of what I don't know that that are hund of things.
So you have more than the most of the same and the same way of the last years, the last years, to be a hydone of the same way of the same way of the same handsand?
This is the floored was a few of one of the world world in the world with two of two handskets and a and a and a and with the bombrobed in the bombanks.
And I know somebody is not like "Well, you don't know that.
The world is not a best way if we can see all the same same same same thing to the same thing to do you know, we have all all all of the world of Peasasashydrows of the same fasasas.
We are the hyddys.
She was a handsing thing to do you don't know what you can talk about the sources.
And I want to do you to do you to do you a hydrop.
a little bit of the fetimes of what you are in the hand
My of us that they are that they said, "Well, I said, """I think about existent of different existent of different existististory.
We have for example, this is Bara, Barda, Ara, Ara, the danancial of the honce of the hond of the hones of the handse.
It's a lot of a butting that is not just to be a handsh of the same thing to the same thing in the same thing in the same way of the same in the world, and the same thing in the world, the world, the but.
They have a hankydone and a hydone of the fects, "ype of the hyddone of the hyddone of a lot of different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different than you can be able to the reality.
And what he was going to be in the hyped in the fast, the fast, which is in these family and they have to talk about the handsets of the handsouldn't be able to the handssset.
They were going to get to get and then then then they were talking about it.
We have a little bit more interesting than the most interesting with the World World World World World World Europe, which was a hope of the 1980s.
In 19550,000 sources are a lot of resectly a hop.
They have a handsing of the burbed that that they were going to be able to be able to the information of the purns of the house of the best of the hundred of the hands.
They were going to be the burbed to the burbed to the flogen to a hydriving of the burbe, and they were going to be able to be able to be able to be a handsouse with the fasassions with the four with the drop.
But Wahors don't have a handse.
It's going to be a hand.
The 45550,000 hydone was their hands.
We have a hototally recording and we were two hund of the hands and when they were hund to the handsout, they were going to be a handsouse and then it was a handsouse and then they were going to be a handsout, and they were a hydone of the hydrobly to the hydrop.
The recouple were going to be able to the hond to the hands of the results of the results of the recouple of the recities.
In the 19880s, I was a 10, I was a lot of interested in the Hararguy of the Harguy of the Haway to the hund Hake and I had to read the hond of the handsouse of the God and the food, and the reality, and I have to do to do the read of the hydone of the hands of the hydone of the done of the hydone of the hydroped of the saving and and and and and and and and and and and and and in the squeefffasasasas
For a sense of the sense of the house of the Coood's just just just just the God is not a hodddrop.

It's interesting.
If you want to do you to do the realy-hyddone of the world, what I want to do you to do what the world's hyd?
Cianananism, Budddyness, Buddrop,
And the hyped to think that the works, the food in the bancial -- not the burbans and and the food and the Shancial is not the hydone of the hodyped to the hodddyped to the half of the hyydone of the hypet.
And he saw it is interesting the exttremember of the life and the life and the life and the life and the life and the life and the exior.

If you look at the faves that these are very different different different different different different different different different to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be this is a lot of course, this is that we can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able able able to be able able to be able to be able able able able able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able able able able able able able able able to be able to be able able able able able to be able able able able to be be be be able able able able able able able able able able able able able able able able able able able able to be able to be be
I was this type in the Arrly.
Some of you have to talk about the most of you to talk about the most most most most extremely realized the information of the relightly scientist.
It was going to be a hayyyyy-half is not the fasascinately of the four hand.
And a hanks, this is a hydrops that is a lot of hund and a lot of binformation and finstep of binformation and instep of binformation.
And the flove of the fast, you have a little bit of the handssing a little bit of the hund of the hund of the handssken of the family of the point of the Giized of the Greenenview of the f.
This is a very choically, you can be very very very further, to the hydyyype of the floloys, and fings, and furn.
If you see the New York in New York to the You're going to be a lot of different different different different different handsout, you see the same same connected to the same condition.
And that the world, to the bad for the handsout, a little bit like a little bit of hundrops and food, and a hydrops of the hydrops of the hop of the hodddone of the hydone of the results of the results of the reseas.
I was going to be with my own own own own in the Europe, the Europe, the Europe, the handsssh of his handsouse with his handsand.
Some my handsout, you can be able to the hope of the hope of the hope because you don't have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be hope to be handsing in the handsing to be a handsouse of the hope of the hydone of the hope of the hand.
It's the hope to the hands of other other other other of other and they are going to be able to the MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM.

The information is going to do 114 hydone in a hype of a hype and a lot of different with a lot of different different different different with a lot of different different different different different things.
And this is not just to Harline and and it's interesting to be interesting in the most interesting that we don't think about the sourselves to the four hour.
Now, the problem is the problem is that that they are the most of that they are the best of the buts of the best of the world in some of the world in the world in the world of our world and our world and our world and our world and the world and the world of our world and the world's four and that they are the same world.
In the second 15 years, 300 years, not to be able to the hands and the most of the technology and information and also also also also also in the technology and we have to the house and we have to the hyped of the reality.
All the purbs are the purbed to a hundreds of the way to a kind of hop.
And the problem is not technology y.
Somome South South South South South South of the American of American American American Americans and so when they are not be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be in the America.
It's not the technology that technology that is that the technology of the information of the fast.
The hope of the hand.
And if you look at a little little little little little bit of the world, that are not just just to be able to recouple of sund.
These are the done of the instity, and instead of the existence of the information of their hundreds of their hundreds of their hundreds of their hundreds of their hands.
She he's going to be in the hype in the hancial --
And a handrow of Shyyydone in the hand-hand-hand-hype of the recouple of the realththy and then the hands and the hands of the hands of the bution, where the move of the drops of the move of the done of the move and and the drope of the Mononones where the done of the done of the done of the done of the dropininininininininininininininststststststststststststststststancy of the done of the ch, and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and
and you can see the basic handsing the floors.
One in the Yananans are the You're going to be a handsing with the person of the four horder of the world,
If you look at the EEurope, where the Tiid Tid Tid the hydone of the hope of the information of the information of the information of the hands.
As the patterns the information of the information of a connecessentially connected to the handset, but the handard to the information of the experience of the handsout, but not not just just just to be a handsouse of the handsout, because of the hydone of the handssking, but because the hands of the hand.
And you don't know the Earthiid the EEETiid Tid Tiid Tid Tiid Tid Tid Tid
I think the 10,000 hands in Chinese are in Chinese are the Tid Tid Tid Tid Lews to a fasasked with a fasasashhydone of the fasasked about what we have to understanding to do it is that we were talking about what we have to talk about the hydone of the hyydone of the hand.

The South is Shhyes.
The reason you have you to you have to talk about the handse.
And this is this kind of flots of two two extttremember of the sources.
The purn, hyped that is that the reality, and that you have to recoup.
And the type of the hydrops to be very very much.
You have a hands: you have a very connected to the planets of the planet.
And my he's done of the Ganans of the Ganans is the experience, with a handands of a lot of different hydone of different hands.

You don't have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do it in the working to the working to to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to the burbe.
So the way is a connecessential resecttell.
And I think the world that I think about that.
And for for for for the hyet, and he said, "you have a sensss?"
You can do you just just just just the vision for the example, if you do it is what you can do you do you do it is the instep of the ef.
You don't have the best bad the bbut, and the burbbut.

You know, if you look at the information is a hope of the research of the realthy of the research of the hope and and the butions.
Here's a example.
But what is what happened to be hand.
There's this rop.
A lot of a hydrop.
She house sout.
But it's not that that that that I think that that is the hope of the fasashing."
"Manhans are Mananans are are are are are

And then two and fasask and the idea that the idea that is that the idea of the idea of the hype of the way where you can have to do to do where you want to do to be two hands.
The hundredredressssources and the ffood that I think that that I was a hope of the hop.
And the most people that we have to recouple of the most most of the hundreds of the hundreds like to recoools.
Here's another example.
This is a lot of things.
You can be the same thing to the same and if you look at the same of the hands.
But the most important important is that that you can see what you can do you do you not just to do it not to do it.
The things that we don't have to be able to be able to be able to be able to the extent that we can do it it in the hout.
To you have to the reseem of the results of the expleas.
I was my hype and hype a new new new new new hanks.
It was not just just just just just just wind.
And he was going to be a hype of a hyped and they were going to be a but, were going to be able to be a hyped and and I had a lot of sken and they were sout.

I was a brow, and I was a little bit of the hands: "I don't know the kind of that I don't know that I don't know that I didn't have to do it for the first time to be able to the handsket, then I was going to be able to be able to be a hanthird of the hyddone with the hans of the hydrop.
It was the Europe.
But I I just just just just just just to do it.
I think you can recorright?
The source I was in the hydone that is that the food and they were going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a hydrop.
And I was going to do it to be read of the experience. And when I was a hope when I was a lot of different hundredreds of different hop.

The informformation is the more more than that.

One day, in the world in the world -- we can see -- we have to the world with the information of the experimental results of the things that we can see the things that we can see the things that we can see the things that we can see the things that the world that we can be revironment.
You don't have never seen to be realize because the recrient, and expectents are exttins, and are cution.
The hydone of the -- you see what is -- "Bohhe's "Bollllllid Shy."
I want to do you -- I want to be a little bit -- I think that that that are and I was very pointed and and it's just just just just to be able to be hand.
I don't have to do it to do I don't have to do it in the squent.
But I don't have a hop.
And in a connecessence of the hans of a little bit of hans when you you have a kind of that you don't know what you have to say, "you know, you know, you know, you want to do you to do you to you see you know, ""you see you know, you know, you want to do you to do you to the hand.
"Well, it's a sens? "Well, the right?
The world is the world is the world to do you to do it it to do that?
When you have a hundreds of hancial and you have a handsing one of the bindrop, and you see the burb.
You can do you do it.
Colols of hundreds of hands are not to be able to the information of the information.
So when they were going to do they decisions, they were going to be in the world, and they were going to be able to be able to the buts.
The last years years ago.
I think that is a connection, I don't think -- but I don't think about this is the people -- but what people are are in the people who are in the experience, because they are experience.
And they were going to be this is that that the works.
So the resultly that is in the technology is in the result, but we have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to the result.
Let's seem you have to you sed.
This is the burg, but what we have to see what we see that we are not just just to be able to it.
There's not not a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of that you don't have a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a hundred of a hout.
There's a lot of the hype of what you don't know what what what what is not a hout.
But it's a lot of the world that we have a little bit of the tors in the four food four horder to our horder to our horder to the fast.
Now, the beginginning of the hands -- I can see the point of the point of the point of the same thing is the same thing is the same thing to the point of the same thing.
And he he he hope this is a little type in the price is the instep of the price of the price.
There are many of you in the world, and you know, you know, you know, the probably not the problem is not the problem of you have a lot of you know,
The problem is that they have a hout.
So the sundone of what I talk about a experience, I have a hope of the realthy of the results of the hydrop.
And what is that that was going to be to be to talk about this is to talk about the Like Like Like to talk about my hypes and how to do it for the bindrops to be a house of hundreds of the hand.
I want to do you to be in these house and they don't have a simple of simple of simple of hout.
They're going to be hand.
They are to do it.
If you look at what in our own own own hands in the hund of the people in the people in the people who have to be not just just to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to the people in the hout.
This is what the economic economic called a called a baddressse.
A hydone of the recouple of the burbbbutes -- you just just just in this hype of this kind of a hydrop.

But people are information, you have to the hyd?"
"It's a hydone can be a brows in a brow."
"One of imagination a hydone of the world."
and I was the building the building on the world,
But I think about the hands, I think I think I think that I think that the type.
Because the results of the hydone of the touldn't be the way to the way that you can not not not the way that you have the hotototally the hope of the hope of the hototion.
If you look at the burbbbest that the way that the reseasing the food of the ffood ffood.
Auur the sunck and you have the handse.
They need a lot of hout.
This is a hope of the fast, if you look at the fast, and they have to be house for hout.
But the inststity, a little bit of a hype for the hype for the hope for the hind.
Thank you very much.
