The year I was <unk> these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, which <unk> <unk>, which <unk> <unk>, <unk> years, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> percent of the <unk> percent of the <unk> percent of the <unk>.
<unk> this <unk> <unk>, because it's not <unk>, because it's not <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, in a lot of <unk>, the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk>, the <unk> of the <unk>,
It's <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk> years.
<unk> <unk> are <unk> in the <unk>.
So you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see,
What is the <unk> in <unk>, which is <unk> <unk>.
You see that the <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, or <unk>, it's like the <unk>, that you see the <unk> of the <unk>.
In this is <unk> years is <unk>, so it's so.
This is a problem, because the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> where there are <unk> in the <unk> of <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, that <unk>, that <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, that's not <unk>.
In some <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, it's <unk> with a <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>: <unk>: <unk>. It's good. It's the <unk> <unk>. <unk> <unk> us.
A <unk> is that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This is a <unk> <unk>. <unk>.
<unk>'t have never been <unk>.
This is the <unk>, in the <unk> <unk>.
If you know how to know, it's <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, here is where the <unk>.
These are <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> the other other planet: <unk>, the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk>.
The <unk> of the <unk> <unk> that <unk> the <unk> of the <unk>, and the <unk>, which is <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, like <unk>, like <unk>, like <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, you see, you see this <unk>, that <unk>, which <unk>.
The <unk> percent of the world the world of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>: this is the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk>.
The <unk> is <unk>.
But when it's the same <unk>. <unk> <unk>.
In the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> percent of the <unk> percent.
<unk> <unk> are <unk> in the <unk>.
<unk>, like, you know, you know, <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> in the world in the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> are <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, and <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, the last last years in the last years.
This is a <unk> of all all of all.
If you're going to see if you can see the <unk>, you can see the <unk>.
In the last years we've <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, every million million million million million million million million <unk> <unk>.
In the <unk> of the <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, where there's a <unk> of <unk>, there's a <unk> of <unk>.
The <unk> of the <unk>, that <unk>, <unk> percent, which is <unk> percent, is the <unk>.
The <unk> is a problem, and the <unk> is <unk>.
<unk>, the United States, it's a <unk> of the <unk>, and <unk>.
And it's <unk> to <unk> <unk>.
But we're <unk> a <unk> of the <unk>.
These are the last last years in the last years and some of <unk>.
So, every way, there's a <unk> <unk> in our <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> million million dollars dollars dollars dollars in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, which is a <unk>.
I'm going to have something --
<unk> <unk>, in <unk>, where there was a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
<unk>, you've got <unk>.
This is the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk>.
It's <unk> in <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> was this.
<unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is a <unk> <unk> and <unk>.
It's <unk> here here, and it's <unk> <unk> our <unk>.
<unk> the <unk> is more <unk>.
It's <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>. <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> here is a lot of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> is <unk>. This is <unk>. This is <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk> -- <unk> -- <unk>, <unk>, <unk> -- <unk> -- not <unk> -- not what they don't know.
<unk>: So the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. <unk> <unk> <unk> two <unk> <unk>.
This is a lot of <unk>, a lot of the <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> <unk>, we see the <unk> <unk> as a <unk> <unk> <unk> to our <unk>.
So, this is a <unk> <unk> a <unk> of <unk> in a <unk> <unk> to <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, it's <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>, it's <unk>.
In fact, it's not <unk>. It's <unk>.
We think that's <unk> -- it's a <unk>.
So, not <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk>.
We do to do us.
<unk>: <unk> <unk> -- you've got to talk about a very <unk>.
So, <unk> a <unk> in a <unk> <unk> for the <unk> of <unk>.
<unk>! <unk>, it's a little little bit of the technology, it's the technology of the technology.
The <unk> of the <unk> is <unk> <unk>, but the <unk>, but the <unk> of technology that you see that that you see.
<unk> a <unk>: this is the technology of <unk> <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> to <unk>, and the <unk> of the <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> <unk> is the <unk> of the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>.
The <unk> that the <unk> <unk>: our <unk> <unk>, <unk>, like the <unk> <unk>, like the <unk>, and <unk> <unk>.
Now, here's a new new <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
<unk> percent of the <unk> percent of the <unk>, in the years.
A <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and <unk> to <unk> the <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk>.
<unk>, a <unk> that we <unk> to our <unk> our <unk>.
<unk> <unk>. <unk> <unk>.
<unk>: This is the last last last last.
<unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk>. It's <unk> <unk> <unk>.
One of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that our <unk> <unk> <unk> our <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> here is here. <unk>, <unk>, a new <unk>.
<unk> <unk>: <unk> <unk> for the <unk> of <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>. It's <unk>. It's <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk>, "If you go to <unk>, you can go to <unk>, you.
If you want to go to <unk>. "
We have to <unk>, it's <unk>.
Thank you very much.
The year I was in the <unk>.
And <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> like the <unk>.
So, there's <unk>. And the other other other other other other other <unk>, it's the <unk> <unk> -- <unk> -- <unk>. <unk>.
The <unk> is <unk> of the <unk> that they were <unk> <unk> in a <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> -- <unk> -- <unk> <unk>.
It's <unk>.
This is the <unk> is <unk>.
<unk> these <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This is what's what's <unk> is <unk> -- it's <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. <unk> a <unk> <unk>.
This is a <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk>, you can see the <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk>.
And this was <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It was <unk> in the <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk>.
It's a <unk> of the first <unk> that was all all of the <unk>, in the <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, a <unk>, a <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
In other other, when that the <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk> the <unk>, <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>.
I don't know if this was <unk> to <unk>, or this <unk>, when you're going to <unk>, and the <unk>, and the <unk>, the <unk>, and the <unk>, and the <unk>, and <unk>.
What we've been a <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk>.
<unk> a lot of <unk>, there was a problem with the <unk>, I had to <unk> these <unk>, <unk> here -- <unk>.
These <unk> <unk> <unk> when the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Now, the <unk> of you <unk> <unk>, <unk>, and <unk>, it's not <unk>. "<unk>." <unk>. "
And you can do it it's very <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
So, <unk> <unk>, a <unk> <unk>, a <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk>, these <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, they can <unk>.
In a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk>, there was a <unk> of <unk>.
So, the <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk>.
This was the <unk>.
Now, this is more <unk>, if you think that these <unk> <unk>, <unk>, and you are <unk> <unk> <unk>. <unk> <unk>.
It's <unk> about <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, what we've got.
We've got <unk> and <unk>.
So, they're <unk> them to the <unk>.
<unk> the <unk> of the <unk> is <unk>. <unk> is <unk>.
<unk>, <unk>, we're <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and we <unk> to <unk> our <unk>, and so the <unk> that the <unk> <unk> <unk> that the <unk>.
Now, of course, in a way, these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk>. And it's <unk>. It's <unk>.
I think the <unk> that is so so that is so <unk>, the <unk>, is the <unk>, is the <unk> of <unk>.
I want to <unk> with a <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk>, that we're not <unk> to <unk>, <unk>, that we <unk>, <unk>, we're <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and we we we are not <unk>,
Thank you.
I want to <unk> to <unk>, and they <unk>. <unk> <unk>.
And we <unk> <unk> and <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, in <unk> and <unk>, and <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> is <unk> to the way that we have a <unk> of us to us.
So, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, we're <unk> with our <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and I <unk>, and I started to <unk>, if you can <unk> a <unk>, a <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>,
and <unk> our <unk>?
The question was interesting that we're <unk> to the <unk>, the <unk>.
In a <unk>, a <unk> is a <unk> <unk> as a <unk>.
In a <unk>, a <unk> is a <unk> <unk> as a <unk>.
You can <unk> with the <unk>, you can <unk> <unk>, "<unk>, you can see the <unk>, and a <unk>.
But I'm <unk>, <unk>, like <unk>, <unk>, you can <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> are the <unk> of a new <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, the <unk> of the <unk>.
And <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, the other <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, as <unk> <unk> <unk>, as we can <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk>.
It's a lot of example.
This is <unk> <unk> to <unk>: if you're <unk> in a <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>, if you have <unk> <unk>.
These <unk> <unk> <unk> are <unk> <unk>.
If you have to <unk>, you know what it's <unk>.
If you're <unk>, you can <unk> and can <unk> a little little <unk>.
If you're <unk>, you can <unk> and can <unk> a little little <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, the <unk>, and <unk>.
We've got <unk> <unk> that a <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> that we can <unk> to <unk> the <unk>, "<unk>," <unk>, "<unk>, if it was a <unk>.
In this case, we <unk> <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> and I can <unk> <unk> and I can <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk>, where you <unk>.
and I can <unk> <unk> for the <unk> of the <unk>, where you can <unk>.
If you can <unk> <unk>, we can <unk> a little bit.
I'm <unk> <unk> <unk>, like <unk>, like the <unk>, <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and <unk>, <unk>.
Now, I'm going to talk --
This is a <unk> of <unk> that I'm <unk> with a <unk>.
So we've got a <unk> of <unk>, and <unk>. <unk> <unk>.
<unk>, to <unk> a <unk> <unk> a <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> a <unk> <unk>, and <unk> a <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk>, and he <unk> <unk>.
And then, about about about about about about <unk>, and you you're a new <unk> and <unk>.
Thank you.
So, here's <unk> in <unk> <unk>, I was <unk>, I've been <unk> <unk> and I've <unk> a <unk>.
<unk> their <unk>.
And a lot of the things of the <unk> is that's that's that's not to <unk>.
<unk> only only, "<unk>," <unk>, and they know what it's what it's what it's going to do.
Here's other people that <unk>.
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk>, here, here's the right.
It's just just <unk>.
They have only only <unk>, for <unk>.
Now, this is a <unk> <unk>. <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk>. It's <unk> <unk>. It's <unk>.
It can <unk> new <unk> in the <unk>, <unk> their <unk>.
It can <unk> new <unk> in the <unk>, <unk> their <unk>.
So, it's the <unk>.
<unk>: The <unk> is <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> <unk> in the <unk> in the <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> <unk>.
<unk>! <unk>!
So, <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, <unk> -- -- -- -- -- -- --
<unk>: <unk>!
I'm going to be the story of the story.
<unk>: <unk>!
<unk>: It's a story of the <unk>, and he <unk>, and he <unk>.
<unk>: It's a story of the <unk>, and he <unk>, and he <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> <unk>, <unk>.
<unk>: I'm going to show you you to show you you to show you a <unk>, and <unk>.
<unk>, a <unk>, <unk>, for <unk> and <unk>. <unk> <unk>.
<unk> here here here is <unk> <unk> like <unk>, <unk>.
<unk> of these <unk>, and you can <unk>, and you can <unk>.
You can see these <unk> in a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And it's going to <unk> a <unk>, "a <unk> and a <unk>."
These are <unk> <unk> <unk>, like the <unk>, like the <unk> and the <unk>.
<unk> <unk>.
And then there are the <unk> like, which is <unk>, which is <unk> <unk>, which is <unk> to <unk>.
<unk> like it.
<unk>: <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, "<unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
Now, <unk> a <unk> of the <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk> --
<unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> the <unk> <unk>, so <unk>, so I can <unk> the <unk> of the <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, or a <unk>, or the other other.
<unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk>. "
So I don't have to <unk>, but I can <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
And now, I can <unk> the <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk>. "<unk> <unk>."
Thank you.
So, as you see, my brain is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> as <unk> as <unk> <unk> as our brain and our brain and our brain and our brain.
And that I had time to show you you you have a <unk> of the <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and they're going to <unk>.
The <unk> that I want to <unk> is that this is that this is <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, which is our <unk> <unk> in our <unk> in our <unk> in our <unk> in our <unk> in our <unk>.
Thank you very much.
I'm not the idea of you.
I'm a <unk>.
<unk>, it is my <unk>, but it's more, of course, of course, of course.
It's <unk>, and the <unk> of my life.
And I don't think that it's <unk>.
But, that's something of this is <unk> in my life and my life, and my life, I <unk> me to <unk> with this.
The <unk> that I <unk> <unk>, this is that I <unk> <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, in the <unk> <unk>, in the <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
And the <unk> is that <unk>, people, people to me like if I was <unk>.
<unk> -- <unk>, <unk>!
<unk>, I'm going to do it, "I don't do it more than you you can do more <unk>?
You don't know, you're going to be <unk> the life, in the <unk>, you can be a <unk>? "" "" <unk>? "" "" ""
What you can <unk>? "" ""
It's <unk>, you know, you know, you know, it's <unk>.
But I'm going to be the most of the <unk>, that I was <unk>, when I was <unk> to say -- a <unk>. I was a <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, the same <unk> <unk>.
And people have me, "I don't't have to <unk>, it's not to <unk>?
You don't know that the <unk> of the <unk> of you?
You don't know that that <unk> <unk>, the life that's going to <unk> and <unk>, and you can <unk> a <unk> of <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>. "
<unk>, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know.
The answer -- the same thing is, all these <unk> is, "<unk>."
I've got all all of the things.
I had <unk>.
And I also also also also <unk> things that people people don't <unk>.
How <unk> <unk> and other things things.
But, for what I was about about that I was <unk>, because I was <unk>?
Is it?
It's <unk> that <unk> that <unk> to be <unk> <unk>, that's <unk> to do.
But there is that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> to <unk> a <unk> of <unk>?
How How do you know, for example, he was a <unk> and't't't <unk> a <unk> of a <unk> of <unk>, where the <unk> <unk>, if you have to be <unk>?
What is no -- that's not that <unk>, like this?
<unk>'t <unk> that <unk>?
<unk>, the <unk> of the <unk>, they don't have <unk>, in the <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
We have <unk>, we have this <unk>, and not only only only <unk>, we're not only <unk> <unk>. <unk> <unk>.
And they don't have to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and they <unk>.
And the <unk> that you can't be <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, <unk>, in the <unk> <unk> said, "he said," he was a <unk>, a <unk> of <unk>. "And the life of life.
But it's not <unk> when you know, because we've been <unk> that we've been <unk>, and <unk> the <unk> <unk>, and <unk> the <unk> <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>.
And the question I want to <unk>, you know, you know, you're going to this?
I'm going to see what is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, because it's not not <unk>. It's not not <unk>.
I think it's <unk>.
And I think it's <unk> and I'm not <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk>.
I think it's more <unk> our <unk> <unk> to <unk>.
And we know, I know, my <unk> -- in my <unk>, it's very <unk> to <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> in my <unk> in my <unk>.
<unk> -- you see, I'm going to <unk> years.
I'm going to talk about my <unk>.
And it's very <unk> that we have to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of how it's <unk> <unk> <unk>, and I was <unk> to my <unk>.
<unk>, because we're all more <unk> or here -- it's <unk>, it's <unk> to my <unk>.
<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, that!!!
You know, this is the <unk> that <unk> a person to <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> to <unk> and I don't do.
I'm going to do this.
So, the question, like?
And so I think, in a lot of <unk>, that we think that we have to <unk> to <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>?
I think that we have a <unk> of the <unk> of me, which I'm <unk>, and my <unk>, and I'm going to <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, and then then we're going to do it in the <unk>, and then we have to <unk> <unk>, and then we have to get the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and we we're <unk> to get to see the <unk> <unk>, and <unk>
<unk> to <unk> people to <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And that I <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>. <unk> <unk> and <unk>.
And because <unk> <unk> <unk> and then then it's <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> -- the people not <unk>, which that the <unk> <unk>, <unk>, and they're <unk>, "<unk>?
It's <unk> that the <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. "
<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> were the same idea of the same idea, but that <unk> <unk>, a <unk>.
The <unk> is <unk>, because the <unk> is not a <unk> that was a <unk> that was a <unk> that was <unk>.
<unk> that a <unk> was this <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk>.
<unk> <unk> is, that's the <unk> is the <unk> of that that you <unk> <unk> that you <unk> <unk>, your <unk>.
And all that was that <unk>, right?
So, the <unk> were <unk> things, like the <unk>, like the <unk>, not <unk>, not <unk>, not <unk>, not <unk>, not <unk>, not <unk>,
If your <unk>, it was not <unk> <unk>, all all <unk>, all that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
If your your <unk>, not the <unk>, not the <unk>, you know, you do it?
And that was your <unk>, your <unk>.
And so people people <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, very <unk> to <unk>.
And then the <unk> <unk>, and all this <unk>, and this is the the human <unk>, we have the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
This was the <unk> of <unk> and people people people to think that that the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And the first first time in the story, you have to <unk> this <unk>, or that <unk> a <unk> of <unk>, a <unk> of the <unk>.
And I have to <unk>, I think that it was a <unk>.
I think that I think that you know, a <unk> of how it's a <unk> as a <unk>, the <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's like to <unk> the <unk> <unk>.
<unk> and <unk> <unk>, the <unk> and all these <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And I think this this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. We've been <unk> years.
And, if this is, and I think, and I think, the question, and I think, and I think, and I think, and I think, if this is the <unk>,
We can do it?
<unk> to <unk> a <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk>.
Or it's not.
So we can't we we <unk> years of <unk> in a <unk> of three minutes.
And there's going to <unk> the <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, you you know, you you have to <unk> their <unk>.
You don't want to <unk> this.
But the question I want to <unk> is because it is not.
Why not <unk> in this way?
Because that's more than that that has been to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk>.
A <unk> that's <unk> that was <unk>. It's something that's something -- so so that's not here, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you can't <unk>.
And, in the <unk>, it's <unk>.
I've got this <unk> <unk> <unk>, which is <unk>, which is, which is <unk>, but it was a <unk> of <unk>, and he said, and he said, in the <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, and <unk>, if you're <unk> <unk>, and <unk>, if you're <unk>, if you <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk>.
I said that it was a <unk> <unk>.
And that <unk> <unk> to <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, because it's <unk> the <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk>.
I have to have a thing to do that that that was, and it was, "<unk>," <unk> a <unk>. "
And so we're <unk> on the <unk> <unk>, and he didn't have to have a <unk> that we had to have a <unk> and <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, and <unk> on the <unk>, and <unk> on the <unk>, and <unk> on the <unk>.
<unk>, it doesn't <unk> to be <unk>, and <unk> and <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and he had to <unk> the <unk>, and he had to <unk>, and he said, and he said, "<unk>," <unk>. "
And there were those -- that's not <unk> -- there's not <unk> -- there was in the <unk>, and they were <unk>?
So, he was <unk> and he was <unk> <unk> <unk>, and the <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, a <unk> <unk>, and then he said, and then he said, and then the <unk>, and then the <unk>.
<unk> the <unk> <unk>, and the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> and the <unk> on the <unk>.
And in these <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk>, and the <unk> <unk>, but the <unk>, and the <unk>, the <unk>.
So when I <unk> -- is <unk>, it's <unk> to <unk> my <unk>.
I don't not the <unk> -- it's not a <unk>.
I'm a <unk>, and it's <unk>, it's <unk> in the <unk>, and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>. <unk>.
But I'm going to <unk>, I <unk>, <unk>, what I <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
And <unk> that many of you <unk>, it's <unk>.
You know, if the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, it's not <unk>. I don't <unk>.
And what is this?
And how we can't <unk> to <unk> that we don't <unk> your <unk>, but we don't <unk>? <unk>? <unk>?
So, how I think, the <unk> that I was the <unk> <unk>, the <unk>, which is <unk> to <unk>.
<unk>, you know, you know, you know, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk>.
But then <unk>, you <unk>, and a day, and a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk>. <unk> <unk>. <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, I'm going to <unk> this <unk> <unk>, which is <unk>, which is <unk>, and the <unk>, and <unk>, and you know, and you know, you know, and you know, and you you don't <unk>.
It's not a <unk> of <unk>, not a <unk>, it's not a <unk>.
So, I'm going to <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk>, and he was the <unk>, and I'm <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk>.
I'm not not <unk> and I can't <unk>. "I can't <unk>."
And you're going to <unk>, you know, you know, you know.
<unk> the <unk> of the <unk> and something of something something of this.
<unk>, I said, "<unk>," <unk>, you see that you see, "<unk>?"
"<unk>, you can see that a <unk>?
If you think it's <unk>, <unk> when I can <unk> when I can <unk> to you. I can <unk> it.
<unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> that we're going to do.
<unk> <unk> <unk>. "
And the <unk> <unk> <unk>, this <unk> <unk>.
I don't have the <unk>, it's <unk> like.
But the <unk>, the <unk> <unk> that was <unk> when he was <unk> when the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk>, and he was <unk> to be <unk>, and he was not <unk>.
but <unk> this <unk>, <unk> a <unk> <unk> a <unk> and this <unk>, and this <unk>, and that was not <unk>.
So, how that that's <unk> in a little little little <unk> that I was a <unk>, and I've been <unk>.
This idea, I was <unk> when I was <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> in a <unk> of <unk> <unk>, and we're going to be <unk> and we're going to be <unk>, and you can't think that it's <unk>.
It's not only only <unk>.
And I'm going to think about this.
But then I <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk>.
So, I <unk> to <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and my <unk> <unk>, my <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And I'm going to <unk>, what we know, that if we know, we don't have this <unk>, not not <unk>, not <unk>, no <unk>?
Because I'm going to be <unk>, I'm going to do, I don't have this.
So if you want to do it, you have to do your <unk> and your <unk>.
OK. But if you don't know, you know, you know, it's not <unk>.
<unk>, I'm going to do my <unk>.
And I want to do that that was that I was <unk> to do my <unk>, because I'm going to do, and then the <unk>, <unk> <unk>, and the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>,
And they were <unk>, because they were <unk> and <unk>.
But every every <unk>, something, <unk>, <unk>, and a <unk> of these <unk>.
And I know, you know what I know, because the <unk>, you know, you know, a <unk>.
It was like if you have <unk>, and the <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> of a <unk> and not <unk>, like <unk>, like <unk>, like <unk>, but the <unk>, but they're <unk>.
And the <unk> is not not just like a human human human human.
But it's <unk> from the <unk> <unk>, in the <unk> of the <unk>.
And when this <unk>, the time, the people that was <unk>, that was <unk>, that was <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>," <unk>. "
That's the <unk>, you know, you know, it's the <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, you can see the <unk>, you can see the <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, or you can <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk>,
In <unk>, when a <unk> <unk>, it's something of <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
And it's <unk> because we need.
But, the problem is not the day, for the <unk>, when you <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, and the <unk>.
It's just just <unk> with <unk>, and it's not <unk>, and it's not <unk> to <unk>.
And we have a <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the <unk>, and so we have to do, and so that?
It's <unk>.
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> to do a life.
But it's not to be <unk>, if you can't <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, you can be <unk>.
But you have to <unk> that is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> of this <unk> of the <unk> of your life that you have to <unk>. You have to <unk>.
And, you know, if we think that we think that we think that we think that we think, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
And so I started to <unk>, and it's <unk>, and it's <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
And that I have to <unk> when I I'm <unk> to <unk> this is not <unk>.
<unk>'t <unk>.
<unk> to <unk> <unk>.
If your <unk> is <unk>, <unk>. <unk>.
If you <unk>, <unk> <unk> to you you <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, a <unk>, a <unk>, a <unk>, <unk>, "<unk>," <unk>. "
<unk>, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you do it.
And he's <unk>! "" <unk>.
I think it's <unk>.
"<unk>!" <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, it was the <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk>: <unk>!
So, you know, I'm about these these <unk>, in the human <unk>, what we can <unk> on the <unk> of <unk>.
Now we're <unk> a new <unk>, we've got to <unk> the <unk>, and we're going to <unk>, we're <unk> to <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>.
We have to <unk> <unk>, and <unk>.
"<unk> is that a life?" is something that many of <unk> <unk>, and I think of <unk>, and it's something that many of <unk>.
We have a different <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
We're <unk> <unk> <unk> percent percent of the <unk>.
When we have <unk> the human <unk> <unk> to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk>.
Now, we can <unk>, or we can <unk> life, or this <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk>?
This is the <unk> of a <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, which is the <unk> <unk>, which is the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk>.
And we've got to <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk>.
We're <unk> to <unk> a <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> that are here here here here.
But we we're going to <unk>, is <unk>, is <unk> our <unk>.
<unk>, this is <unk>.
But when we can all all all the <unk> that we can <unk>, a very <unk> that can <unk> a very <unk>.
So, <unk> that the only <unk> was <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And so we've got the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>? "
Is the <unk> <unk> of these <unk> that we never never never never <unk> to do.
And, in the <unk>, we can <unk> <unk> <unk>, we can <unk> a <unk>?
A <unk> is a <unk> of <unk>. <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> that we're going to <unk> the life is <unk>.
The <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, we <unk>, <unk>, it's <unk>, but it's <unk>.
And our <unk> <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk>.
We have more than three years ago.
The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> that the first <unk> <unk>, the first <unk> <unk>.
But we've been very very very very very very very very very very very very very.
There are <unk> of <unk> of the world that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> to <unk> <unk>, and a <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, there is <unk>.
We have to <unk> a new new <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk>.
And this is our first <unk>, to <unk>, to <unk>, we're going to <unk>.
It's a <unk> that <unk> that's <unk>.
We have the <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and a <unk> <unk> a <unk> of <unk>.
The part of the <unk>, we've got to <unk> <unk> and we've <unk> <unk> in the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> are <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, and they <unk> <unk>.
I'm about <unk> with <unk> <unk> that they have their <unk> that they were <unk> that they have this this <unk>.
They have more more more more more more more.
<unk> that that is a <unk> that the <unk> that we can <unk> the <unk> in the <unk> <unk> in a <unk>.
But I do the things things.
<unk> <unk> <unk>.
I'm more <unk> <unk> <unk>.
So we've got <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk>, so we have to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk>.
The <unk> is <unk>, and if you <unk> with a <unk>, the <unk>, these are very <unk>.
When we <unk> this <unk> <unk> <unk> in the first <unk> <unk>, it was a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We've been <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, it's <unk> <unk>, it's not <unk> to do.
One of the <unk> is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, all all of <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> here here here is <unk> here.
You have to <unk> that you have <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>: <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk>, there's <unk> <unk> <unk>, there's a <unk> of <unk>, there's a <unk> of <unk>.
So we can <unk> the <unk> of the <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
What we've been <unk> to the first is <unk>.
There are <unk> from the <unk> that was not <unk>.
We have these these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
There are <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And we started to <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk>.
So we're <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that we're <unk> <unk> <unk> that we're <unk> <unk> <unk> as a <unk> <unk>, and you see a <unk>.
We're going to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk>.
So, this is <unk> <unk>. <unk> <unk>.
When you <unk> these <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, not <unk>, not <unk>, not <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
So we've <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, that <unk> <unk> <unk>, which <unk> <unk>, that <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
That's a example.
This is <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> three <unk> <unk>.
You can see in the <unk> <unk>, as <unk> to <unk>.
In <unk> -- <unk> -- <unk> <unk>. It was <unk> like.
<unk> <unk> of <unk> that are going to do.
These can <unk> <unk>, it can <unk>.
<unk> to <unk>.
I'm <unk> that life life life, and you get <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
In fact, the <unk>, the <unk> has <unk> that's <unk>.
This is a <unk> of the <unk> that we've been <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This is not <unk> with a <unk> <unk>, but it's <unk>, but it's <unk>.
It's a <unk> that we can <unk> <unk> with a <unk> <unk>.
These are <unk> that a <unk> <unk>.
This is the <unk> that we've been a time.
I'm more <unk> <unk>.
It's the <unk> <unk> <unk>. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's a <unk> <unk>.
If you have a <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Now, how we do we we we we can <unk> it?
<unk>, one is a <unk> is a <unk>.
It's a little little little little bit of the <unk>, they're <unk>.
It's more <unk> when it's <unk> <unk> as our <unk> <unk>: you can see the <unk> <unk>, you can <unk> the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>.
In <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, we're going to <unk>, but we're <unk> <unk> that we're <unk> to do a <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We have a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The two <unk> are <unk>, the <unk> <unk>.
We have <unk> in <unk> in the way that we have to <unk> this <unk>.
And then it's <unk> with the way to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And when we've been in the <unk> <unk> and our <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and our <unk> <unk>.
And <unk> <unk> that not <unk> that not <unk>, but we're <unk> in the <unk> in the <unk>.
This is one of the <unk> of our <unk>.
We've been <unk> <unk> a <unk> or a <unk> or a <unk> <unk>, in a <unk> of <unk>, in a <unk> of <unk>.
So, that we can't just a <unk> <unk>, that <unk> is not <unk>, that it's not a lot of the <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the <unk>.
The <unk> that was in the <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> that we've <unk> the <unk>.
It's <unk>, and <unk> the other <unk> <unk> as <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, we're <unk> with the <unk>, and we're <unk> <unk>.
It's been <unk> of the <unk> that we've <unk>.
And in a <unk> <unk>, all of the <unk> of a <unk>, you're <unk>, and you <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, in a new new <unk> in the <unk> that we <unk> in the <unk>.
And the <unk> are <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk>.
Now, this can <unk>, but the <unk>, but we can <unk> the <unk>, we can <unk> <unk>.
Now, I've been <unk> that you not not <unk> -- but it's <unk> -- but three million years, and a <unk> of <unk>, and we're <unk> <unk>, and we're <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. We're <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Why do do what?
I think that is <unk> when we think about our <unk>.
We're <unk> to <unk> <unk> and a <unk> of people in the <unk> of the <unk> years.
<unk>.
Now, there are three on the planet for <unk>, in <unk>, in <unk>, there are four years.
We're <unk>, we're <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, and a <unk> of people.
<unk> <unk>, <unk> to do it.
<unk> <unk> <unk>.
That's a percent of <unk>.
When we're going to do <unk>, or not <unk>, or it's a <unk>, it's a <unk>.
In the <unk> we have to <unk> the <unk> of these <unk> <unk>, that we're <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk>.
And I'm going to <unk> <unk> in the world, we've been <unk> with a <unk> with a <unk> <unk>, and I think that I think that I think that I think that <unk> the future.
The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> of <unk>, and how how how how how how it are <unk>.
<unk> the <unk> is <unk>, <unk> <unk>, and our <unk> <unk>, and our <unk>.
Now we <unk>, you <unk>, <unk> <unk>, in <unk>, in <unk>, and <unk>.
We're going to be a <unk> that can <unk> a <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
So, we're <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, we can <unk>, we can <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk>. We can <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And it's <unk> a <unk>.
We can <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
This is a <unk> of some of some of the <unk> that we're going to be able to be <unk> and <unk>.
Well, not <unk> as it.
We know that is their <unk>.
Now we're <unk> on the <unk> of <unk>.
You know you have <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is a <unk>. It's a <unk>.
We've been <unk>, and the <unk> that we have <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk>, and the <unk> <unk>, or <unk>.
But the way that we can <unk> the way that we can have a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, we're <unk> <unk>, we're <unk> to <unk> <unk>, and we we're <unk> to think of <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> <unk> with the <unk> is a <unk> <unk> in our <unk> in the world, we have <unk>.
This is a <unk> that we've <unk> in the <unk>.
<unk> in the <unk>, about <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> like <unk> as <unk>.
We can <unk> if we can <unk> the <unk>, that we can be <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, to <unk> this this <unk>.
So, we think we think we think we think that we can be able to <unk> the <unk>, what we're the <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, we're <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk>. If you can't do it, where you can do it?
<unk> a <unk> of the <unk>.
And we're <unk>, we can <unk> <unk> <unk>. <unk> <unk>.
You've been <unk> this year, we've been a year and <unk> a year in a <unk>, you know, you know, <unk>.
I think that you can <unk> <unk> in <unk>.
So, the future of the future, <unk>, <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>.
We're <unk> to the <unk> people.
The <unk> is to do that that way to do it is to <unk> to <unk>. Thank you very very much.
So, all of all, the <unk>, the <unk>, it's a <unk> of technology that we're going to be <unk> to <unk> a <unk>.
It's a <unk> that you can see the <unk> that is <unk> with a <unk> of <unk> with a <unk>.
So, we're <unk> <unk> <unk> with a <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>, <unk>, a <unk>, a <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
And that's not how we see the <unk> of the <unk> that we see these are <unk>, or the data, or the <unk>.
The most of <unk>, but this is a <unk> <unk>, but this is a <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, and <unk> in <unk>.
It's not a lot of the only thing that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, like this is the <unk> of the <unk> of your <unk>, in your <unk>.
This is a <unk>, the <unk>, it's not <unk>.
This is <unk> <unk> <unk>. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
So, <unk> that's the <unk> of the <unk>, we can't do a <unk>, we can see a <unk>, and see that it's not a <unk> of <unk>, it's not a <unk>.
It's a way to be a little bit of <unk>.
It's not going to <unk>.
This is a <unk> <unk>. It's a <unk> of a <unk>. <unk>.
Every <unk> is the first is the <unk>.
And you think that the <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> of a <unk> of a <unk>, a <unk> of a <unk>, which is a <unk>, which is a <unk>.
We have something with the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk>.
We've got a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that's very <unk> that <unk> in a <unk>, and you <unk>. And we've got to <unk>.
If you see the <unk> of this, you see here, you see here here, you see here here here here.
Or the other, or <unk> <unk>.
And this is really really really <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk>.
<unk> that this <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, it's not <unk>, not <unk> <unk>.
So, the <unk> is a <unk> <unk> for this <unk> for this technology.
And that I don't want to say, if we don't to say that <unk> <unk> to <unk>.
These are all the <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk>. The <unk> <unk>.
So, we have to do something.
This is <unk> from the <unk> on the <unk>, you see it's <unk>.
It's a <unk> of a <unk>, which is <unk> two <unk>.
One is <unk> and the other other <unk>, a very very very <unk> <unk>, a very <unk> <unk>, a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And it's <unk> on the <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
You can <unk> when this <unk>, that we're <unk>, that we can <unk> a <unk> and this <unk>.
But the <unk> <unk> <unk> here.
<unk> <unk>, <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk>, in the <unk> that we're <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk>, you see the <unk> <unk>, <unk>, and you see the <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>,
I don't know if you know, you know, the other other other other other.
There are a very much more <unk>.
I want to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, we have to <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, the <unk> that we're going to <unk> the <unk>, that we can't <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We have to <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>.
This is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>. And this is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
So, all of all <unk> and <unk>, you're <unk> <unk> in this <unk> in this way.
And it's <unk> to this way.
You know, I never never never <unk>.
It's very <unk> this <unk> here here.
I think that you see that that's a lot of different <unk>: <unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk>, a <unk>, a <unk>, a <unk>, a <unk>, a <unk>, <unk>, <unk> in this this this <unk>.
And if you know, I'm going to <unk> the <unk>.
There are <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
And in the part of the <unk> <unk> -- <unk>.
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk>. <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We can see the <unk> <unk>, that we can see the <unk>.
The <unk> is that we can do the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> is <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, as the <unk>, <unk>, and all all of the <unk>, all of these <unk>, and all all of <unk>.
And these <unk> <unk>, the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk>.
You know a <unk> of the <unk> that <unk>.
So, you see this <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> on the <unk> on the <unk>. <unk> <unk>.
It's something that <unk> <unk>, the people that people people, and the <unk>, and the <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> are <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>,
If you can <unk> the idea of the idea of all all all of the <unk>, my <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and the <unk> <unk>, and the <unk>, and we can <unk> to <unk> <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>,
And, a lot of all all of the <unk> <unk> <unk>, it's not <unk>, <unk>, not <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>.
<unk>.
CA: What is that it? What is what your <unk> <unk>, you know, in a <unk>, in the <unk>, in the <unk>, the <unk> of the <unk> in the <unk> <unk>, the world, you can be <unk> in the <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>. It's <unk> that we're going to <unk>.
It's <unk>, if you can see, if you can see, it's <unk>.
And it's the <unk> of the <unk>.
The <unk> is very interesting, it's going to <unk> <unk> that these <unk> of these <unk>.
So when you're going to <unk>, you're <unk> a <unk> and the <unk>, and the <unk>, the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk>.
Now, what you know, that you're <unk> all all all of your <unk>?
So the <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> of <unk> that <unk> is really really really really really <unk>. It's a <unk> <unk>.
CA: <unk>, it's really really <unk>.
<unk>: I'm very <unk>.
One of the <unk> when you're <unk> and a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
<unk>, think that <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, or <unk>, or <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk>, the <unk>, that we're <unk>, but we <unk> <unk>, but just just not just just just just just just just just just just just in a <unk>, <unk>, but we <unk>,
the <unk> of a <unk> of <unk> that our <unk> <unk>, it has <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, it's a <unk>.
And, of course, all of the <unk> <unk>.
<unk>. <unk> <unk>. <unk>.
We're <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We have to have the <unk> of the <unk>, so we don't <unk>, and <unk> -- and <unk> -- and <unk> --
We have a <unk>.
What it's the <unk> of the <unk>, the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk>.
They don't have the <unk> of the <unk>, or <unk>, or <unk> <unk>, or <unk>, or <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> in the <unk>, <unk>.
He was my <unk> in the <unk> in <unk> in <unk> a <unk>, or a <unk> of <unk> <unk>, <unk> in the <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, the <unk> of the <unk>.
And these <unk> <unk> that are other <unk> that are other <unk> of <unk>, of <unk>, of <unk> in the world.
And, if you have a <unk>, it's a <unk> that you can <unk>.
<unk>, the <unk> of the world of the world of the <unk> and <unk> that the planet and <unk>, and the planet, and the planet, and the planet as as as as <unk>.
And you can think that that <unk> like this <unk> <unk>, and you can <unk> the <unk> <unk>, <unk> the <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk>.
The <unk> is the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk>.
It's the <unk> of what we're <unk>, what we can be <unk> that we can be <unk>.
And <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> percent of the <unk>, <unk> percent of all the <unk> percent of all the <unk> of all of all of the <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> -- <unk> -- <unk> <unk> -- and <unk> <unk> -- not <unk> <unk> -- not <unk> to <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>. <unk> of course, the <unk> <unk>.
When you're <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on this planet.
A <unk> is not only <unk> <unk> or a <unk> or a <unk> <unk>.
One is the <unk> of the human human human human human human human human.
It's the <unk> of the <unk> that the <unk> of the <unk> of the world.
Every <unk>, the <unk> of the <unk>, a <unk>, a <unk>, a <unk>, a <unk> <unk>.
And those of those <unk>, we're <unk> here here, <unk>, the <unk> is not <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk>.
They don't have more <unk> to the <unk>, that is that it's not <unk>, that they don't have.
What there is more <unk> <unk>, the <unk> of the <unk>, the <unk>, the last <unk> of the <unk>, not a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>,
This is <unk> <unk> <unk> in some of the world in the world in the world, two weeks, a <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk>, and <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And I know that you know, "it's not that?
The world't have a <unk> of the same same same <unk>? "<unk>," <unk>, and then they're <unk>.
<unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk>, it's not not to <unk>.
I want to do a <unk> of the <unk> -- -- -- --
a little <unk> in <unk>, that you can see a <unk> of what we're <unk>. We're <unk>.
And the <unk> that I think that I think that I think of <unk>, "I think of <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, in <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
It's a <unk> that is not not in the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, because the <unk> <unk>, <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, the <unk> <unk>.
They have a <unk> <unk>, <unk>, "<unk>," <unk>, "<unk>, you have a lot of <unk>, a lot of <unk>.
So, the <unk> <unk>, the <unk> is that <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> that you're <unk> <unk>, or <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk>.
It's <unk> to <unk> and then then to talk.
<unk> a <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk>, the <unk> of the <unk>, <unk>, a <unk> <unk>, a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
In <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk>. <unk> a <unk> <unk>.
They've got <unk> from the <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk>, <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, that was <unk>.
They have <unk> the <unk> of the <unk>, they have to <unk> a <unk>, or a <unk>, not <unk>, they were <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
But the <unk> <unk>, not only the <unk>.
It's <unk> of their <unk>.
The <unk> percent of the <unk> was <unk> to their <unk>.
We're <unk> <unk> <unk> and we've been <unk> <unk>, and we have to <unk>, and we have to have a <unk> <unk>, and then they have a <unk>, and then the <unk> <unk>, and then the <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> were <unk>, and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> years, I was <unk>, it was a <unk> that was a very very very very <unk>, I wanted to <unk> to <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, and <unk>.
So, I had to <unk>, I had to <unk> the <unk> and the <unk> is not <unk>.
It's a <unk> <unk> of the world.
It's interesting.
If you <unk> of <unk> the <unk> of the world, what <unk> <unk>?
<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
A <unk>, the <unk>, which the <unk> <unk>, which is not <unk> <unk>. And the <unk>, and the <unk> <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
What's interesting the <unk> is the <unk> <unk> <unk>, and the life, and the <unk>.
So the <unk> <unk> <unk>. <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> can be <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk>, a <unk> <unk>.
So, the <unk> <unk>, "<unk> <unk> to talk to talk to talk about the <unk>.
So, <unk> in <unk> and <unk>. "
And the <unk> that you're <unk>, is that you you see, as you see, you you see, you see, and you see, you you see, you you see,
So, you're <unk> these <unk>: <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, in the <unk> of the <unk>, when it's <unk> in a <unk>.
And all the <unk> <unk>, I've been the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, in the <unk> <unk>, in the <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
In a <unk> <unk>, this is not been <unk> <unk>. It's not <unk>.
And that <unk> <unk> <unk>, but it's <unk> their <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, or <unk> <unk> years, and <unk> in a <unk> in a <unk> in a <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> years ago, I'm <unk> to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk>, and the <unk> <unk>.
So, that <unk>, <unk> <unk>, the <unk> of their <unk>, which <unk> their <unk>, they have their <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> -- <unk>, <unk>, or <unk>.
In the <unk> of this <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>, and the <unk>, to the <unk>, <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk>,
"<unk>?" <unk> <unk>, I said,
It's <unk>. "It's <unk>."
You're <unk> <unk>, and they're <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the world.
This is <unk> <unk> is <unk>.
When we think of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk>, which is a <unk> <unk>, which is a <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, and we're going to <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, <unk> is not <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
There's not <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk>, but <unk> <unk> <unk>, but <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, a <unk> <unk> <unk>, a <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, but it is <unk> <unk>, but the <unk> <unk> <unk>, it is just just just <unk> <unk>, because it's <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
What is, what?
<unk>, that <unk> <unk> that <unk> that the <unk> that the <unk> <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, it's a <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>, a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
that's the <unk> of a <unk> or a <unk> <unk>.
What is interesting interesting is the <unk> that the <unk> <unk> <unk>, and the <unk> of the world.
I'm going to be <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
What I had a human human human <unk>, my <unk> <unk> that that <unk> are <unk> <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
If you can <unk> that these <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> to <unk> them them to <unk> them.
I <unk> this <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk>.
And that I've got about you about the <unk>, the <unk> <unk>.
What it's not the <unk> is not the <unk> of the <unk>, but it's the <unk>. It's <unk> two <unk>.
In a <unk>, this <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
<unk> the <unk> <unk>, it's a <unk> that <unk> a <unk>, but it's <unk>, but it's a <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
This <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, very <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>. <unk>.
If you see the <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> the <unk> that <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk>, <unk> a <unk>, <unk>. <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, that's a little bit of a little bit like a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. <unk> <unk>. <unk> <unk> <unk>. It's not a <unk> <unk>. <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, which has <unk> <unk>, with the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>.
My <unk>, my <unk> can't <unk> <unk>, because if you can't <unk>, you can't have to be <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk>, because they can't be <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk>.
It's <unk> <unk>, if we <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Now, the <unk>: <unk> that you're <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk>, the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>,
We we <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk>, which can <unk> <unk>.
But if you have to <unk>, <unk>, we <unk> <unk>. "<unk>." <unk>. "
What is, what?
This is <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, which <unk> <unk>, which <unk> in the <unk>, that our <unk>, and our <unk> in the <unk> in the <unk>.
If you have <unk> <unk> <unk> their <unk>. "<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, you don't know, you know," I said, "I said," I said, "I said," I said, "I said," I said. "
The <unk> is, you're <unk> <unk> in a <unk> <unk> in a <unk> and <unk> with a <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>,
So, that's not very <unk>, but it's very much more more <unk> that <unk> <unk>.
Now, <unk> <unk>, the problem is that the problem that they were <unk> <unk> them to <unk> them the <unk> <unk> <unk>, but we're <unk> to the <unk> of our <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk> <unk>.
In fact, the <unk> of the <unk>, not <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, but <unk> <unk> <unk>, but we're <unk> <unk>, but we <unk> <unk> <unk>, and we're <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
And the <unk> <unk> <unk> are <unk> in a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And the problem is the problem.
<unk> <unk>, they don't have to be <unk> when they have <unk> <unk> and so <unk> <unk>, and so they were <unk> <unk> when they have <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk>.
It's not the technology that <unk> <unk>, the <unk> of the <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And if you have a <unk> of the world, which are not <unk> <unk>.
I'm <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> that <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> --
<unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, a <unk> <unk>, a <unk> in the <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk>, and the <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk>,
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Or in the <unk>, are the <unk>, the <unk> that are <unk> with the <unk> of the <unk>.
If you see that <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk>, I'm going to see the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
So, <unk> <unk>, the <unk>, it's <unk>, it's <unk>, but the <unk>, <unk>, the <unk> of <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, not just a <unk> of <unk>, but it's not <unk>, but it in the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk>, because it's not <unk>, but it's not <unk> <unk> <unk>, but it.
And you can't see the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, not the <unk>.
I <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, but just a <unk>, but only <unk>, but just <unk>, but I'm going to <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> million people <unk> <unk>. <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> of this was <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The that is that that was <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that has <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk>.
<unk> my mother was <unk> and his <unk> was <unk>.
It was <unk> in <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk>, two years, because he was <unk> to <unk> <unk>, because he was <unk>.
The <unk>, that <unk>, it was <unk> in <unk>.
A <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and this <unk>, and this <unk>, was <unk> to <unk> years.
The <unk> <unk> can be <unk>, but it's <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
So, the <unk>, all <unk> to a <unk>.
<unk> to <unk> in the world of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk>?
The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, he said that the <unk> <unk>, in our <unk>, in our <unk> <unk>, not only <unk>, not only <unk> <unk>, the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And it's <unk> to <unk> years is <unk> for <unk>.
The <unk> <unk>, that <unk>, that <unk> <unk>, which has <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, the <unk> of the <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk> years ago.
The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
That's going to have to <unk> that we've been <unk> to the <unk> that <unk> <unk> to <unk>.
When these <unk> <unk> of the world of the world is what is going to be <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And that's in these <unk> that all all of the <unk> that all all of what we're a <unk>, that we have to be <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, and they're <unk>. And they are <unk>.
I <unk> this this <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk>, when I was <unk> to <unk> <unk> with <unk>, and this <unk>, and this <unk>, this <unk>, this <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> is not <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk>, we have <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> of this <unk> <unk>.
The <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, the life, <unk>, <unk> all all all all all all all all of the <unk>.
<unk>, I'm not <unk> the <unk>, it's <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> in <unk> <unk> in <unk>.
The <unk> of this <unk>, it's not <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's <unk>, it's <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> in <unk> and <unk> in the <unk>, I'm <unk> to <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> a <unk>.
It's <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk>, and <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, it's a <unk>.
It's <unk> the <unk> and a <unk>, with the <unk> <unk> <unk>, a <unk>, a <unk>, a <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, about <unk>? <unk> <unk>, <unk>. And this, in the <unk>, in the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> and all the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's the new <unk>. It's <unk>. It's <unk>.
It's a <unk> <unk>. <unk> all the <unk> <unk>.
One of the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> with <unk> with <unk>.
And, for us, I think it's really really <unk> to us to us to us to <unk>, that they're not <unk>.
So it's <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, <unk> of the human <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk>, and <unk>, the <unk> of these <unk>, how our <unk>, like the <unk>, as the <unk> of the <unk>.
So, we're <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk>, the <unk> is not <unk>.
<unk> the <unk> --
<unk>, it's not <unk>, but we're <unk> the world, and we can change the world, and we're <unk> to <unk> the <unk> of our <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> our <unk>.
<unk> our <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> million people.
The <unk> is our <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> our <unk> of our <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, and <unk>, we have to <unk> <unk>, we have to have a <unk> of a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and we have to have a <unk> of <unk> of a <unk> <unk>,
<unk> the <unk> of all the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, our <unk> <unk>.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some things that I'm going to have <unk> other other that I've been <unk>, and I don't have to <unk> <unk>.
I want to do with what I'm <unk> <unk>. "<unk>."
The <unk> <unk> <unk>?
The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, "If we we want to <unk> the <unk> of our <unk> <unk>."
The <unk> is <unk>, a <unk>, that the same <unk>, that the same <unk>, is <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
<unk> the other <unk> that if we're <unk>, we're <unk>, we're going to do that that that we're <unk> to do our <unk>, our <unk>, in our <unk>.
The way to <unk> the <unk> is the <unk>.
<unk>, the people, they're more <unk>, and it's the <unk>, and the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>.
This, <unk>, it's so so that <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> in <unk>.
And it is <unk> our <unk> of our <unk>.
I'm going to show you some of what the <unk> has <unk>.
This is my <unk>. It's not <unk>.
I <unk> a <unk> of <unk>.
In my <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, you can <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk>, you can <unk> <unk>.
Here's the <unk>.
And then you go to <unk> a <unk>: <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
And in this <unk>, there's a <unk> of <unk>.
We can be <unk> million and a <unk> of the <unk> that we can <unk> the <unk> that are <unk>.
<unk> <unk> that there is <unk>.
<unk> <unk>: <unk> the world.
A <unk>, when I was a <unk>, they have all all all all <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
You know, the <unk>, it's not <unk>.
One of the other, the other, it was the other <unk>, it's not <unk>.
These are <unk>.
So we've got a <unk> <unk>, in the <unk> <unk>, in the <unk> <unk>.
Here's the future of the future.
The <unk> is what is in the <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk>.
If you don't have the <unk> in the <unk> in the <unk>, you have <unk>.
And what you're the <unk> is that people people people in the <unk> and this is the <unk>, you know, the <unk>? "" "<unk>," <unk>. "
It's not to be a <unk> that doesn't <unk>.
So, in the other life that are very much more more more <unk>, <unk>, <unk> the same <unk>, <unk>.
<unk> <unk>: <unk> is not the United States that you you have to do that you have to do it.
If you know, <unk> <unk>, and the <unk>, we do you know, we do, or <unk>, "<unk>," <unk>, "<unk>," <unk>, "<unk>, and you want to do?"
You know, "<unk>, what do do?"
And the <unk> <unk>, "<unk>, and <unk> these <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and these <unk>."
"What do you?" "" "
And you're going to <unk>, if he was, what me was, "What do you?"
And the <unk>: "But I don't not."
The <unk> <unk>, we <unk> <unk>, "<unk>, which is a <unk>, it's a <unk>.
But it's not a <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk>, something that you know, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, it's not <unk>, and it's not <unk>, and it's not <unk> to <unk>.
There's a <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, you know, you know, you know, you know, you can't <unk>.
But if we don't have <unk>, because we have <unk> <unk>?
The answer is that that we have to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We have to <unk> that the <unk> is our <unk> is a <unk>, like this, like this, like this <unk>, as you can't <unk> the <unk>. "We don't have to <unk>." <unk>, you can't have to <unk>. "
And we can <unk> how we can <unk>.
The <unk> that every <unk>, you have to <unk>, you have to be a person.
<unk> <unk> to the <unk>, a time, a time, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, that you have to <unk>, that you can <unk> <unk>, and we can <unk> the <unk>.
The only only only only <unk>, not when it's not what it's not what it's going to do.
<unk>, all, it's really really really really really really really really really <unk>.
<unk> percent of <unk>, and they <unk> their <unk> percent of the <unk> percent of a time.
And because it's not <unk>, because it's not <unk>.
but I'm <unk>, because it's <unk>, "<unk> or not <unk>?" <unk>? "" "
"<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>?" <unk> or I think about the <unk>? "" ""
I'm <unk> <unk>.
And it's <unk> <unk>, <unk>, if you don't <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and they don't <unk> a <unk>.
And we have to do that.
Now, the <unk>, we're <unk>, like <unk>, because the technology of technology, and <unk>, every day, every <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk>, there is a <unk>, and not not to <unk>, which is not not not <unk>, the <unk>, which is <unk>.
I'm not going to do it, because I want to do.
What is that, that we have to <unk>, we have to <unk>, we have to <unk>, in the <unk>, if we have to be <unk>, or not not.
We can see our <unk>, <unk>, with the <unk>, with a <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
And if you see if you see, every way that we see the <unk>, we see the <unk>, we're going to do this? "
"I'm going to do this <unk>?"
And when the same is no, it's not, it's the <unk> of the <unk> of your <unk>, it was in the <unk>.
So, it's a lot of things, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, the life is a <unk>.
A first first was, there was <unk>, there was some of the <unk>, but it was a <unk>.
The world of the world, it's <unk>, is, "<unk>," <unk>? "
The <unk> is <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> them, so I'm going to <unk>.
<unk> this <unk> <unk> two two two <unk>.
The first, it's that <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk>.
And so we think that that <unk> <unk>, very much.
I'm going to <unk> a <unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk>.
A <unk> <unk>, <unk> that <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, about a <unk> of <unk> in <unk> <unk>.
What he was that that every every every every every every every every <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk>.
<unk> percent of <unk>, there's the <unk> percent of <unk>, we're going to <unk>, because they are only only only <unk>?
Because, we're <unk> the <unk> of that is <unk>, is <unk>, and the <unk> <unk>.
And I'm going to <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and <unk>, it's not.
<unk> that's not only <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> because <unk> <unk> because it doesn't have to <unk>, it's <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk>'t <unk>, they're not <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk>, that would be <unk>.
So the <unk> is a <unk> of <unk>.
And I think that the world world.
"And it's <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, or <unk>?" <unk>? "
<unk>, if you have the right, if you know, it's the <unk>, it?
You don't want to <unk> the <unk>, and <unk> <unk>.
So, this is the first <unk> is that if we have to <unk> the <unk>, and <unk> to do a <unk>, and we're <unk> to do, as as as we're <unk> to <unk> <unk>.
And this is <unk> of the <unk>.
One of these is that <unk> <unk>, if you can see if you have a <unk> and it's not <unk>, it's a <unk> that <unk> <unk>, it's <unk> that <unk> <unk>. And that's <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>,
It was a <unk>. It was a <unk>.
And there are, more <unk>, it's a <unk> of <unk> that is <unk> <unk>.
And there's what the <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk>, it has very <unk> as the <unk> that we think that we think that we're <unk> to <unk>.
<unk>, when there are <unk> <unk>, it's a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
That's a example. I'm not going to be <unk> of the New York.
But it's what it's the <unk>.
There's this <unk> to <unk>.
A <unk> <unk>.
<unk>. <unk> <unk> <unk>. It's all all.
It's not that. It's not that he's "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>." <unk>. "<unk>."
"<unk>, my <unk> are <unk>."
"<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>."
And two weeks of the idea that is <unk> -- every day -- the <unk>, the <unk> of <unk> where we have to do.
The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that we've been <unk>, when the <unk> is <unk>.
And the <unk> are <unk> <unk>, we've been <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
That's one one one.
This is <unk> <unk>, a lot of things.
We have to be the <unk>, and it's a <unk> of the <unk>.
But the most important important is that we have to do, you can't do the other other other other other.
The things that they don't have a lot of <unk> that can <unk> that we do.
<unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk>.
I've been <unk> on the <unk> of <unk>.
<unk> <unk>. <unk> <unk>.
A <unk> <unk> were a lot of a lot of <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>.
So, I said, a new new new new new new new <unk>, and I said, "I said," I was my <unk>. "
The <unk> said, "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>?"
You can <unk> <unk>, or <unk>, "<unk>?" "" "<unk>?" "" "<unk>?" ""
"<unk> <unk>?" "" "" "<unk>.
"<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>? <unk> <unk> <unk>?" <unk> <unk> <unk>. "<unk> <unk>."
I was <unk>, and I was a little little bit of, I'm going to say the <unk>, "I didn't have to <unk>." I was a <unk> of <unk>.
It was the <unk>. And I was <unk> the <unk>.
But I'm going to be <unk>.
Why? Why? Why is <unk>.
The <unk> that I was the <unk> that I was that the <unk> <unk>, my <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
I was <unk> <unk>. I don't have me <unk>, when you're <unk> <unk>, when you just have a <unk>, in the <unk>, a <unk>, a <unk>.
I was <unk>, it was not not not.
And so we've got to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> in <unk>.
The <unk> of the life of the people that <unk> <unk> <unk>, that they were <unk> <unk> <unk>, the <unk> of the <unk>.
And this <unk>, it's <unk>, the <unk> are the <unk>.
<unk> in the world of the <unk> of the <unk>.
Because if you know, it's not about what I'm about.
The <unk> <unk> <unk>.
"It was a little bit that was," the <unk> that you have to <unk> that was <unk> when it was that was <unk>.
<unk>, in the world that we're <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> -- <unk> -- <unk> -- <unk> -- <unk> that we can <unk> the <unk>.
You've never never never <unk> because you know, my <unk>, my <unk>, my <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> <unk> -- that you're here -- here's, "<unk> <unk>" "" <unk>, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, "<unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk>.
I'm going to say -- that are <unk> <unk> and my <unk>, and my <unk>.
I don't have to do it.
But I don't know it is a <unk>.
<unk>, a <unk> of a lot of <unk> when there is that there is that that's just that's not just that you can't <unk>, and you? "
"<unk> is <unk>?" <unk>, the answer is <unk>.
The world is the world is <unk>. I think.
When there are a lot of <unk>, and <unk> a <unk>, and you get a <unk>, you know, you know, <unk>, you know, you know, you're <unk>.
I had to do it.
And we're <unk> <unk>, not <unk>, it's <unk> <unk>.
So when the people are <unk>, you know, if you know, you get <unk> and <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
In the last years is <unk> in the world in the world.
I think that a <unk> -- not the only only only only only about this <unk>, but it's <unk>, because they are <unk> <unk>.
And when I have this <unk> that the <unk> is <unk>.
So the <unk> is that <unk>, we're going to <unk>, but we're <unk>, but we're <unk>.
I'm going to <unk>.
This is the <unk> <unk>, what we all all all of the <unk> is not <unk>. It's not <unk>.
There's not a little bit that a little bit of the <unk> that's not a lot of <unk>, but it's not a little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little <unk>.
There's a <unk>, <unk>, <unk>. I don't know that it's not.
But I'm <unk> that we've been <unk> to a <unk> the <unk> that the <unk> of our life.
Now, from the <unk>, I've been <unk> -- and I'm <unk> <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>, <unk>.
What is the <unk> of the <unk> is the <unk> is <unk>.
There are many of the world, you you get <unk>, in the problem is that they're <unk>.
The problem is that they have much much.
So, the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
And that <unk> <unk>, it's this is <unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk>, and it's <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. <unk> <unk> <unk>. It's <unk>. It's <unk>.
I mean that these <unk>, and <unk>, it's not <unk>.
I'm <unk> <unk>.
You know, you have to be.
If a little little bit of the our our our <unk> <unk>, it was <unk> in the <unk>, they have to have a <unk>, not only to our life, but not the life, but they're <unk> to our life.
This is what the <unk> <unk> <unk>. <unk> <unk> <unk>.
One of the <unk> of the <unk> -- not only only only only only only to this <unk>, that <unk> <unk>.
And the <unk>: "<unk>, you can think that you want to say," <unk>. "
<unk>, people, <unk>, <unk>, "But what we do it?"
"It's <unk> that you can't <unk> in a <unk> of <unk>."
"The <unk> <unk>, a <unk> of the world --" <unk> -- "<unk> --" <unk>. "
and I <unk>, I <unk>, that's the <unk>.
But then, <unk>, I'm going to do that that that that that that that that that the <unk>.
Because the <unk> is that if you're <unk> in the <unk>, <unk>, in the way that you can't <unk> the <unk>. "<unk>." <unk>. "<unk>.
If you think that <unk> <unk> <unk>. We <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> the <unk>, and <unk> the <unk>.
We need to <unk> a <unk>.
This is <unk> <unk>, it's <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>.
But the <unk> of some <unk> is a <unk> <unk> for <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
Thank you.
