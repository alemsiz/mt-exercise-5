<unk> year, I showed these <unk> <unk> that the <unk> <unk> <unk>, which for almost three million years had the <unk> <unk> <unk> in the United States, <unk>, <unk> of the United States.
<unk> this <unk> the problem because it doesn't show the <unk> of the ice.
<unk> <unk> <unk> is, in a sense, the heart <unk> of the global climate system.
It <unk> <unk> and <unk> in summer.
The next <unk> will be a <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of the last 25 years.
<unk> <unk> are <unk> in red.
You see, you can see, they <unk> up to the blue <unk>.
That's the ice in <unk>, which <unk> in summer.
You can see that the <unk> ice <unk>, of five years or more, it's like the blood here, which here <unk> from the body.
In 25 years, she went from this, so.
This is a problem because the <unk> is the <unk> <unk> the <unk> ground around the ocean, where there are huge <unk> of <unk> that, <unk> are <unk> in <unk>.
<unk> to the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>, that <unk> could <unk>, <unk> this point of not <unk>.
In some <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, the <unk> is already <unk> from the water.
The <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> with a <unk> team at a <unk> <unk> last <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>! <unk>: <unk>. <unk>: She's fine. The question is if you look at it.
And this is that this <unk> <unk> <unk> from the north.
This is a river in <unk>.
<unk> had never <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This is the <unk> river, in the <unk> <unk>.
If you want to know how the sea level for the sea level to <unk> on <unk>, here is where the sea.
These <unk> are <unk>.
On the other side of the planet: <unk>, the largest <unk> of ice on the planet.
<unk> month, scientists have <unk> that the <unk> of the ice is in <unk>, and that <unk> on some <unk> <unk>, is particularly <unk> in <unk>.
<unk> at six feet of the level, like in <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk> of ice, you see new <unk>, which a few years ago, they were <unk>.
<unk> percent of the world's population <unk> water from that <unk>.
<unk> <unk>: this <unk> is the source of <unk> water of this city.
The <unk> is <unk>.
But when you go, the same happens to the water.
It's <unk> on <unk> <unk> <unk>. <unk> 40 percent.
<unk> <unk> are in crisis.
<unk>, as you read, they're <unk>.
<unk> <unk> in the world brings to a <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> are <unk> to a <unk> out of the normal and <unk>.
<unk> times over the last 30 years, <unk> to the <unk> <unk>.
This is a <unk> of the whole <unk>.
If you look in the <unk> context, you can see the <unk>.
We've got 70 million <unk> in the last five years, we've been <unk> 70 million <unk> in the oceans every day.
Look at the <unk> area, from <unk>, to <unk>, and on both parts of the <unk> <unk>, where there's a <unk> <unk> of oxygen in the ocean.
The <unk> of global <unk>, with <unk>, which is 20 percent, is the use of <unk> <unk>.
<unk> is a problem, and <unk> is even worse.
The United States is one of the two countries with <unk> in China.
And they <unk> to build a lot of other <unk>.
But we're <unk> to a <unk> of direction.
These are the projects <unk> in the last years and some <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
And so, there's a <unk> politics in our country.
<unk> <unk> and oil <unk> have <unk> million dollars in the last year to <unk> <unk> <unk>, which is a <unk>.
<unk> picture me something --
<unk> <unk>, in <unk>, where I live, there was a <unk> <unk> billion <unk> of <unk>.
You may have seen it on the <unk>.
This is the largest flow of <unk> in America.
It's been around <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> of one of the <unk> <unk> was this.
<unk>: <unk> ♫ ♫ <unk> the <unk> is a <unk> and happy.
It's <unk> here in America, and it makes our economy.
<unk> the <unk> is <unk>.
It's <unk>, <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> is from here.
The largest <unk> society on the <unk> is <unk> <unk>. This is his <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> <unk>: <unk> -- Al <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> -- they don't know what they're talking.
<unk>: So the <unk> <unk> <unk> two <unk>.
This is one of them, one part.
<unk>: <unk>: <unk> we see the <unk> changes as a <unk> <unk> to our business.
So, in fact, our <unk> is <unk> a huge amount of money in a <unk> <unk> to make public and <unk> the truth of <unk>.
In fact, <unk> is not <unk>.
We think it's <unk> -- it's got a good <unk>.
So we don't <unk> of climate change.
We want to do it.
<unk>: <unk>: <unk> <unk> -- you've heard a lot of it.
So, we <unk> a <unk> <unk> for <unk>.
<unk>! <unk>! <unk> cars are a little <unk>, but this is the sound of the <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> is in the main <unk> of global <unk>, but the <unk> technology <unk> that you see changes everything.
Let's look: this is the <unk> <unk> technology.
<unk>: <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> to the economic issue and the national security.
<unk>: <unk>: <unk> America is in crisis; the national security.
The <unk> that the <unk> all: our <unk> from the <unk> <unk>, like <unk> <unk> and oil <unk>.
Now, there's a new, <unk> solution to <unk>.
<unk> America: 100 percent of <unk> energy in 10 years.
A <unk> plan to <unk> America to work, <unk> more <unk>, and to help <unk> global warming.
<unk>, a solution that <unk> our problems.
<unk> America. <unk> more.
<unk>: This is the last.
<unk>: <unk>: That's <unk> energy to America.
One of the <unk> ways of <unk> to <unk> from the <unk> that <unk> our planet.
<unk>: The future is here. <unk>, sun, a new <unk> network.
<unk> <unk> two: <unk> <unk> for jobs <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> America. It's time to be <unk>.
<unk>: A <unk> <unk> says, "If you want to go to your own, you go to your own.
If you want to go far, you go together. "
We have to go far, quickly.
Thank you very much.
<unk> year at TED, I did a <unk> on <unk>.
And I'm going to try to <unk> about how the car works.
So, here we go. And for the people who were not there, the <unk> is the largest scientific experiment ever <unk> -- <unk> miles of <unk>.
His task is to <unk> the conditions that were in the less than a <unk> of a <unk> of the universe -- to <unk> million times a second.
All of that is simply <unk>.
This is the car under the <unk>.
<unk> these <unk> <unk> in the <unk>.
This is what I work on. It's called <unk> -- <unk> feet and has a <unk> of <unk>.
This is a picture of <unk> in <unk> in construction, you can see the <unk>.
<unk> <unk> last year, we <unk> the car for the first time.
And this picture was taken by <unk>.
It was because of <unk> <unk> in the control <unk>.
It's a picture of the first <unk> particles that had done all the <unk> of the <unk>, <unk>, with a part of the <unk>, and <unk> particles in the <unk>.
In other words, when you <unk> that picture the 10 <unk>, you know that the car, which is a great <unk>.
I don't know if it was this to <unk> more or this, when somebody <unk> on Google and <unk> that the <unk> page was this.
That means we have had a <unk> impact beyond to that scientific impact.
And a week later, there was a problem with a car, had to be here -- these <unk> <unk>.
These <unk> <unk> <unk> when the car works in the <unk> <unk>.
Now, the <unk> between you are <unk> and <unk>, "It's not true. I'm too <unk>."
And they can do it because when they are very <unk> to be the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
So, <unk> degrees, to a <unk> temperature temperature <unk> to that space between stars, these <unk> can bring that <unk>.
In one of the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>, there was a <unk> of <unk>.
So the <unk> <unk> <unk>, and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This was the result.
Now, this is even more <unk> if you think that these <unk> <unk> more than 20 <unk>, and that <unk> about 30 <unk>.
They <unk> about 50 <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, what we did.
We <unk> them and <unk>.
They're now <unk> all the time.
<unk> the end of <unk> the <unk> will be again.
We <unk> it, and we try to get some data to <unk> or <unk>, and continue so our <unk> to discover what are the <unk> that <unk> the universe.
Now, of course, in a way, these <unk> <unk> the <unk> of science and <unk> engineering of <unk>. It's easy to <unk>.
I think the fact that it's so difficult, the fact that it's the value of things like <unk>.
I want to end with the words of a <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, who, <unk>, in <unk> of <unk> experiments of his <unk>, his <unk> was Michael <unk>, said, "No," No <unk> so <unk> about the <unk> of human mind as the <unk> of science as the <unk> that the ideas of science are <unk>, that there are no <unk> in nature, that our <unk> are <unk>, and that there are not a new <unk>. "
Thank you.
I want to start <unk> to when, from children, <unk> <unk>.
<unk> like <unk> and <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, actually, to think and <unk> problems.
The <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> to the way that we <unk> the world around us.
So, from <unk> <unk> of our <unk> with <unk> objects, with <unk> objects, together to my <unk> <unk>, and my <unk> <unk> <unk>, I started <unk>, "And if we use a computer, instead of just <unk> as a digital computer, instead of <unk> <unk> as a digital <unk> that moves on a <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> an information <unk> with <unk>, hands, hands, <unk> <unk> an information with <unk>.
and <unk> to our <unk>?
The question was so interesting that I decided to <unk> the answer, building <unk>.
In a few words, a <unk> computer <unk> as a <unk>.
In a few words, a <unk> computer <unk> as a <unk>.
You can <unk> them with your hand, they can say, "<unk>" between them, hear their movement and have a radio <unk>.
But <unk>, they're <unk> objects like <unk>, you can just <unk>.
<unk> are the example of a new tools to <unk> the digital information.
And as they become more <unk>, <unk> of the movement, others, and <unk>, and as they become more <unk>, <unk> of their movement, others, of how we can explore new and <unk> <unk> of <unk>.
Let's start with some simple example.
This is <unk> to show: if you put it in a direction, the video <unk>, if you go to a <unk> direction, the other side, you get back to the other side, you get back.
These <unk> <unk> are <unk>.
If you <unk> them, you start with what's going on.
If they come up, they can <unk> it up and they can <unk> a little.
If they come up, they can <unk> it up and they can <unk> a little.
They also <unk> their movement and <unk>.
We had to realize that one of the interesting <unk> of the <unk> was that we could use <unk> <unk> on data, for example, to <unk> a color like a <unk>.
In this case, we have three <unk> <unk> as a <unk> of <unk> and I can <unk> to <unk> the color in that central, where you go.
and I can <unk> to <unk> the color in the central, where you <unk>.
If we <unk> too much, we can <unk> a little bit.
There are also <unk> possibilities of <unk>, like <unk>, <unk> and <unk> <unk> where people can try things, and <unk> the results of <unk>.
Now, I'm --
This is a sequence of <unk> that I do with a <unk> program.
Here we have a game of words that is in <unk> and <unk>.
<unk>, to every <unk> <unk> a letter on every <unk>, <unk>, to every <unk>, <unk> a letter on every <unk>, and as I <unk> to <unk> words, and he <unk> to <unk> up a <unk>.
Then, after about 30 seconds, you get <unk>, and you have a new <unk> of <unk> and new <unk> to try.
Thank you.
Here we have kids in <unk> at <unk> <unk>, I did so that I took them in a way that I <unk> them and <unk> a video.
They're very <unk>.
And one of the interesting things about this <unk> is that you don't have to give people many <unk>.
You just say, "<unk> <unk>" and they know what to do.
Here we have other people who <unk> it.
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk>.
It actually wanted to <unk>.
They were just <unk>, for him.
Now, this is a <unk> <unk>.
You could build a tool for the <unk>. He's <unk>.
It can <unk> new characters in the scene, <unk> their <unk>.
It can <unk> new characters in the scene, <unk> their <unk>.
So, this is <unk> out the sun.
<unk>: The sun is <unk>.
David <unk>: Now, it's got a <unk> in the scene.
<unk>: The <unk> <unk>.
<unk> work! Yes!
So, <unk> the <unk> and <unk> can <unk> the characters --
<unk>: <unk>!
<unk> your story.
<unk>: <unk>!
<unk>: It's a story with the <unk>, and it can tell him how you <unk>.
<unk>: It's a story with the <unk>, and it can tell him how you <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> away, <unk>.
<unk>: The last example that I have time to show you is a tool, made of <unk>, to <unk> and <unk> music.
is a tool, made of <unk>, to <unk> and <unk> music.
The <unk> here are <unk> as you're low and <unk>.
<unk> of these guys have four different <unk>, and you can choose which to use.
You can also <unk> these <unk> in a sequence <unk>.
And they just <unk> a <unk> sound and a sequence.
These are the effects that you can control of live, like <unk> and <unk>.
They <unk> it to a particular sound and then <unk> to <unk>.
And then there are the effects of as time and <unk>, which is <unk> to the entire sequence.
<unk> how it works.
<unk>: <unk>: <unk> <unk> a <unk> in two <unk> <unk>, "the <unk> in a series, the <unk>, <unk> another <unk>.
Now, let's take a low line.
<unk>: <unk>: Now, let's take <unk>...
<unk>: <unk>: And now I'm going to <unk> the <unk>, so I can control the effect of alive.
<unk>: <unk>: <unk> the entire sequence <unk> the time on one hand or the other.
<unk>: <unk>: And now we're going to <unk> the bottom to give.
<unk>: <unk>: <unk> the <unk>.
So I don't have to <unk> before, but I can <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk>.
And now, finally, I can <unk> the entire sequence <unk> sequence on the left <unk> <unk>.
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is to build new <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> to how our brain work.
And today, I had time to show you one of the results of this <unk>, and some <unk> we try to bring out of the lab.
The concept that I want to <unk> is that it's <unk> this new generation of <unk> objects to <unk> with media, which <unk> information in our world in the way we want.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the time I'm going to talk to you.
I'm a <unk>.
<unk> books is my <unk>, but it's more of that, of course.
It's also the love and the <unk> of my life.
And I don't expect it to change.
But, this, something that is <unk> success in my life and my career, which has brought me to <unk> the whole with this work.
The particular thing is that I wrote this book, this <unk> called "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
And the result is that everywhere you have, people <unk> me as if I were <unk>.
<unk> -- <unk>, <unk>!
I'm going to <unk> up and say, "You're not afraid of you can't do any better?
You don't fear to write all the <unk> of life without having to be able to create a book that can <unk> to someone? "
you can <unk> to somebody? "
It's <unk>, you know.
But it could go worse, except that I remember over 20 years ago, when I started to tell people -- I was a <unk> -- I wanted to be a <unk>.
I <unk> the same <unk> <unk> from fear.
And people said to me, "<unk>'t you know I didn't have to be able to be successful?
You don't fear the <unk> of <unk> you?
You don't fear of this <unk> all of life without anything to have anything to come out and to die on a <unk> of <unk>'s <unk>? "
So, you know.
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is, "Yes."
Yes, I fear of all those things.
I've always had fear.
And I'm also afraid of many other things that people could not <unk>.
As <unk> and other things are <unk>.
But, as far as I thought, and <unk> <unk> is why?
Is it <unk>?
It's <unk> that anybody who who <unk> to be <unk> from a job that you <unk> to do.
But what is there so particular in the <unk> <unk> <unk> about health <unk> in a way that other <unk> don't do that?
How did my father, for example, he was a <unk> <unk> and I didn't remember once in her 40 years of <unk> in which asked if they were afraid to be <unk>?
There was never -- that <unk> <unk> John, how do you do?
<unk>'t <unk> that, <unk>?
<unk>, the engineers <unk> as a group, they don't have <unk>, in <unk>, <unk> the <unk> of being <unk> <unk>.
We <unk>, we have enough this <unk>, and not only <unk> but <unk> of all of the <unk>, we have this <unk> to be <unk>.
And they're not going to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that, only in the <unk> century, <unk> young people and often, by hand.
And the people who didn't have <unk> to be really <unk> from their <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, before he died in the last <unk> said, "Every book my book has <unk> me a little more." And a <unk> <unk> about the work of their life.
But we don't <unk> when we <unk> it to say why we heard these things so long that somehow we completely <unk> and <unk> the <unk> that creativity and <unk> are in some <unk> way that creativity and <unk> are in some <unk> ways and <unk> that art at the end, <unk>.
And the question I want to <unk> all here today is: you agree with this idea?
It's fine to you this thing -- because also, <unk> from a <unk> distance to me.
I think it's <unk>.
And I think it's also <unk> and I don't want to <unk> <unk> in the next century.
I think it's better to <unk> our great <unk> to live.
And I certainly know that, in my case -- it would be very <unk> to start <unk> to that <unk> <unk> of <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> in which I'm in my career in.
<unk> -- <unk> -- <unk>, I'm pretty young, I've got to 40 years.
I still have about four <unk> of work in me.
And it's very <unk> that anything <unk> in the world as the work that <unk> after <unk> of the world as the work that <unk> after <unk> of my last book.
<unk> <unk>, because we're all about, or less friends here -- is <unk> that my greatest success is to my <unk>.
Oh, <unk>, what you thought.
You know, this is the kind of thinking that brings a person to start <unk> <unk> at nine in the morning and I don't want to do it.
I want to continue to do this work that I love.
So, the question is, how?
And so I think, after many <unk>, that the way to work to write is what you create a <unk> <unk> <unk>, OK?
I have to be a distance of security between me, which I'm <unk>, and the natural <unk> to what <unk> <unk>. And as I was going to get it all last year models about how to do it, <unk> to look through time, looking for other society to see if you have the best ideas and find some other society to see if you have better ideas and more <unk> ideas.
about how to help people <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity of creativity.
And that research took me to the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
It <unk> because they <unk> in <unk> and then <unk> back.
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> -- people don't believe that creativity <unk> from men, OK?
And he <unk> that creativity was this <unk> <unk> and that <unk> to men from some <unk> <unk> and <unk>, for <unk> reasons and <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> these <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of creativity.
<unk>, <unk>, <unk> to have a <unk> that <unk> from far.
<unk> were the same idea, but they <unk> that kind of spirit without a <unk>.
which is <unk>, because the <unk> didn't really understand that a <unk> was a particularly somebody who was.
<unk> that work.
<unk> <unk> here, that's the distance I talk about -- that <unk> <unk> that <unk> you from the results of your work.
And everybody <unk> that was so that I thought, right?
So, <unk> artists were <unk> to <unk> things, like the too <unk>, no?
If your work was <unk>, you didn't <unk> to <unk> the <unk>, everybody <unk> that <unk> state from this <unk> <unk>.
If your work <unk>, it wasn't all your work, right?
<unk> <unk> that was your <unk> to be a <unk>.
And so people <unk> to <unk> a lot of time.
And then the <unk> <unk> and everything <unk>, and we <unk> this great idea; we put the human <unk> to the universe above all of the universe and <unk> and <unk> and no longer <unk> space to <unk> creatures that <unk> from <unk>.
This was the <unk> <unk> and people tend to think that creativity was completely from <unk>.
And for the first time in history, <unk> to <unk> to this or that artist as a <unk> to a <unk> rather than to a person with <unk>.
And I have to tell you, I think that was a big <unk>.
I think you're going to be like a <unk> person to believe that to be like a <unk> as a source, <unk> and <unk> of all the <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, <unk> and <unk> is a responsibility too big to give to human <unk>.
It's like asking someone to <unk> the sun.
<unk> and <unk> completely <unk> the <unk> and creates these <unk> <unk> on the <unk>.
And I think it was this pressure to have <unk> artists in the <unk> 500 years.
And, if that's true, and I think it's the question, the question is it becomes, and right now?
Can we do it?
You can go back to a more <unk> understanding of the relationship between human and <unk> <unk>.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we can't <unk> 500 years of thinking about <unk> in a <unk> talk.
And there are probably people in the audience who <unk> <unk> <unk> on their <unk>, <unk>, you do that <unk> people <unk> on their projects.
You probably don't <unk> you on this thing.
But the question I would like to tell you is -- why not?
Why don't we <unk> this way?
Because it makes more sense of anything that I've ever heard to explain the <unk> of the <unk> process.
A process, as anyone who ever <unk> to do something -- so, basically, everybody here -- knows, you don't <unk> <unk>.
And in fact, it can <unk> to be completely <unk>.
I did this <unk> <unk> with an extraordinary <unk> <unk> <unk>, who has now 90 years, but which was a <unk> for the entire life and said that during his <unk> in the <unk> <unk>, <unk> out in the <unk> <unk>, <unk> out in the <unk> <unk>, <unk> out in the <unk> <unk>.
He told me that he was like a <unk> <unk>.
And that <unk> to her from <unk>.
They had to come, because he was <unk> the land under his feet.
<unk> to have one thing to do to do at that point and was in, words, "<unk> as a <unk>."
And so he went to home and he came from this <unk>, and he wouldn't have to do other that take a piece of paper and a <unk> enough enough to get, and <unk> and <unk> on the page.
<unk> times not <unk> to be enough, so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> without being able to come home and <unk> through the <unk> through and she would <unk> through the <unk>, looking, as she said, "another <unk>."
And then there were those times -- this was never going to -- there were moments when the <unk> was almost <unk>, OK?
So, he was <unk> at home and he was looking for the paper and <unk> the <unk> through, and he had a <unk> in the while he was <unk>, and she said, how she was <unk> with the other hand and <unk>.
<unk> the <unk> from the tail and <unk> in her body and <unk> on page.
And in these cases, the <unk> would be <unk> on the <unk> page, but the <unk>, the last word to the first.
So when you <unk> it -- it's <unk>, it's exactly <unk> to my <unk> process.
Not all my <unk> process -- I'm not a <unk>.
I'm a <unk>, and my way of <unk> is; it <unk> to the same <unk> every day and <unk> and work on top.
But even me, in my <unk>, I <unk> against that thing, sometimes.
And I'm <unk> that many of you the <unk> made.
You know, even if the work and ideas <unk> me from a certain source, I couldn't <unk> it.
And what is this thing?
And how can we <unk> it to it so that you don't have your head, but rather, that <unk> <unk> us?
And as I mean, the best example I have is the <unk> <unk> <unk>, which I've <unk> several years ago for a <unk>.
I was talking about this, and you know, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> of life has been the <unk> of the artist <unk> <unk>, trying to control, <unk> these species of completely <unk>.
But then <unk>, he was <unk>, and one day when she was <unk> on a <unk> <unk>, <unk> everything.
<unk> <unk> and everything of a <unk> that little <unk> of <unk>, which comes into his head as <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, and <unk>, and she wants, you know, it's wonderful, and the <unk>, but it doesn't know how to <unk>.
It's not a paper, it's not a <unk>, it's not a <unk>.
So, I starts to hear this kind of old <unk> <unk> in him, "I'm going to lose, and <unk> <unk> from this song.
I'm not enough <unk>, and I can't <unk>. "
And instead of going to <unk>, they <unk>.
He took the whole <unk> process and made something completely new.
He <unk> up the sky and said, "<unk>, you see I'm <unk>?"
"<unk> you that you can write a song now?
If you really want to <unk>, <unk> in a more <unk> moment when I can take care of you.
<unk>, <unk> to <unk> more.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. "
And his process <unk> came after that.
Not the work, the work was still <unk> as always.
But the process, and the <unk> <unk> that <unk> was <unk> when he <unk> the <unk>, the <unk> that out of him, <unk> that problems and <unk> it back from where you were, that it didn't have to be a <unk> and <unk>.
but <unk> this <unk>, wonderful <unk> <unk> <unk> a conversation between <unk> and this <unk> thing that was not <unk>.
So, how much <unk> that story is going to change a little bit of the way I <unk> and I'm going to <unk> once.
This idea, I'm <unk> when I was <unk> "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>," and I'm going to go to one of the <unk> that we all work on something and we can't do it and you start thinking it's going to think that it's going to be a <unk>, which is going to be the <unk>, which is going to be the <unk>.
Not just <unk>, just <unk> the book written.
And I started thinking about <unk> this project.
But then I <unk> that <unk> to the air and <unk> us.
So I <unk> my face on the <unk> and <unk> my <unk> to a <unk> corner of the room.
And I said high <unk>, "<unk>, what, we know that if this book book is not going to be <unk>, no?
Because as you see, I'm <unk> everything I have, I don't have this.
So if you want it to be better, you have to <unk> and do your part.
OK. But if you don't do it, you know what, you don't do it.
I started writing the same because it's my job.
And I would like to be <unk> that I've been <unk> to do my part. "Because at the end of this is so, OK -- <unk>, <unk> in the <unk> Africa, the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the moon, <unk> and <unk> that <unk> that <unk> for hours to the <unk>.
And they were always <unk>, because the <unk> were <unk> and <unk>.
But every once a lot, <unk>, and one of these <unk> artists actually <unk>.
And I know what I talk about, because I know you have seen it, you all, at some point, a <unk> like this.
It was as if time <unk>, and the <unk> <unk> through a kind of <unk> and he didn't do anything else from the <unk> <unk>, like the <unk> <unk> before, but everything <unk>.
And all of a human <unk>, not only as a human.
But it <unk> from <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> fire.
And when this <unk>, people <unk> what was, he <unk> the people <unk> what was, he called him.
<unk> your hands and <unk> to <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, God," God, "
That's God, you know.
<unk> <unk> <unk> -- when the <unk> <unk> the <unk> of <unk>, <unk> this <unk> with them and <unk> <unk> in <unk> from "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>" to "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, which you can hear in <unk> or in <unk>.
In <unk>, when a artist has done something of impossible and <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> -- a <unk> of God.
And it's because we need to do it.
But, the problem comes up after that, for the <unk> itself, when you <unk> and <unk> that are 11 <unk> of <unk> and <unk> the <unk> of God. There's no more.
It's simply a <unk> with great <unk> to <unk>, and maybe never <unk> to <unk> that <unk> to that <unk>.
And maybe nobody <unk> the name of God still <unk>, and what does it have to do with the rest of his life?
It's hard.
This is one of the <unk> <unk> to do in a <unk> life.
But maybe it doesn't have to be so <unk> if you can't believe, <unk>, that the most <unk> <unk> of your being <unk> from you yourself.
But let me just show you that data from a <unk> source of this <unk> part of your life that you have to <unk> else when you're done.
And, you know, if we think that way it changes.
And so I started to <unk>, and it's <unk> for several months during the <unk> of the book that I was soon, the <unk>, <unk>, <unk> of my success.
And what I have to continue to <unk> when I feel like this is, I don't fear.
You don't <unk>. It's not just your job.
<unk> to <unk> for your part, any could be.
If your work is <unk>, <unk>.
If the <unk>, <unk> to you <unk> a few <unk> of <unk> some kind of <unk>, for one moment through your <unk>, then "<unk>!"
<unk>, you do the same your <unk>.
And <unk>! "<unk>!"
I think, you know, I think it's <unk>.
"<unk>!" <unk>! "<unk>."
Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk>: <unk>!
As you know, as I talked about some of these projects on the human genome, what it can <unk> and about the <unk> of new genes.
We're now <unk> a new path: we started to <unk> biology and now starting from that digital code, we're <unk> into a new <unk> of biology, <unk> and <unk> life.
We always tried to <unk> great questions.
"What is life?" It's something that many <unk> are <unk> to understand in different levels.
We tried different <unk>, <unk> to the <unk> terms.
We're <unk> for almost 20 years.
When we <unk> the human genome to move from the <unk> world of biology to the digital world of biology to the digital world.
Now, we can <unk> the life, or create new life from this digital universe?
This is the map of a little <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, which is the species from the <unk> genome between those that can <unk> into the lab.
And we tried to reduce the genome to <unk> one even smaller.
We're able to <unk> a <unk> of genes about 500 that are here.
But when we look at its map, it's <unk> simple than our own.
<unk>, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can <unk>, one at one time, it's very <unk> that this can bring a <unk> cell.
So I thought that the only way to <unk> this <unk> to <unk> some of these questions.
And so we started the <unk> of "Can we <unk> a <unk>?"
Can the chemistry <unk> of <unk> these great molecules that we've never been able to create before?
And, in case, can we make a <unk>?
A <unk> is simply a piece of <unk> material.
The speed with which we're able to <unk> life is <unk> to <unk> <unk>.
Our <unk> to write the code, instead, <unk> slowly, but it's <unk>.
And our <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk>.
We've <unk> over 15 years ago.
The process has <unk> a lot of <unk>, <unk> with a <unk> <unk> before <unk> experiments.
But we found that <unk> of DNA is very difficult.
There are <unk> of thousands of cars in the world that <unk> small <unk> of DNA, of the <unk> of <unk> in 50 <unk>, and it's a <unk> process. The <unk> is long, the <unk> there are.
So we had to develop a new way to <unk> these <unk> and <unk> the <unk>.
And this was our first <unk>, starting from information from digital information of the <unk> genome.
It's a small virus that <unk> bacteria.
We designed the <unk>, <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> a <unk> of DNA of about <unk>.
The interesting thing is when we took this piece of <unk> material and we <unk> it into the bacteria, the bacteria have <unk> to read this code, and <unk> the <unk> particles.
<unk> particles have been <unk> by cells, are <unk> back and they <unk> the <unk> <unk>.
I talked about the <unk> members of the <unk> industry that they've certainly <unk> this model.
They have <unk> more of you.
<unk> that this is a situation where the software can really build the same <unk> in a <unk> system.
But you could do the bigger things in the <unk>.
You could build the whole <unk> of <unk>.
They are more than <unk> <unk> of <unk> code.
So we thought of <unk> in the size of the virus, so that we can change the <unk> to understand what the <unk> of a <unk> cell.
The <unk> is <unk>, and if you start with information in a computer, these must be very <unk>.
When you <unk> this genome for the first time in <unk> <unk>, it was a <unk> for every 10 <unk> <unk>.
We've discovered, <unk>, 30 <unk>. If we were using that original sequence never <unk> to be able to do it.
One of the process is design <unk> 50 <unk> that <unk> with all the other <unk> of the other <unk> of 50 <unk> to build smaller <unk> that <unk> together.
You have the <unk> of the <unk> here.
You've probably read that there are <unk>.
<unk> <unk>: We have a <unk> code on four <unk> <unk>: A, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> of those <unk> <unk> together about 20 <unk>, and there's a <unk> order of <unk> for every <unk>.
So we can use the code for writing words, <unk>, <unk>.
What we did at first, was <unk>.
Some of them were <unk> by the fact that it was not <unk>.
We designed these <unk> to <unk> by simply <unk> with <unk>.
There are <unk> that <unk> them and <unk> them.
And we started to <unk> parts, <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> in a way that <unk> <unk> <unk> to them to <unk> <unk>.
But anyway, we've made these <unk> in <unk> so that we're <unk> to create a <unk> that we're trying to create a <unk> that we're going to be a minute.
We're trying to <unk> the process.
So, this seems the <unk> of a <unk> <unk>.
When you start these <unk> very <unk>, over 100 <unk> <unk>, you don't get <unk> directly in the <unk> <unk>.
It's <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
So we've <unk> some other <unk>.
<unk> of another <unk> called <unk> <unk>, which in biology <unk> to <unk> the DNA that we can <unk> the <unk>.
Here's an example.
This <unk>, called <unk> <unk>, it can <unk> three million <unk> of <unk>.
You can see in the <unk> of the <unk> like his <unk> is <unk>.
And in 12 -- 24 hours, it's <unk> exactly as it was before.
<unk> thousands of organisms that are able to do it.
These organisms can <unk> completely.
We had to live under <unk>.
I'm absolutely sure that life <unk> in space, and you <unk> to find new <unk> of water <unk>.
<unk> to say that, NASA showed that this happens.
This is a picture of <unk> that we built using these <unk>, just by just using the <unk> with the <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> <unk> them.
This picture was not <unk> with a <unk> <unk>, but with a <unk> <unk>.
It's a <unk> so big that we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk>.
These are photos that <unk> a period of about six seconds.
This is the <unk> that we've done a little time ago.
They are more than <unk> <unk>.
It's the largest <unk> of a <unk> structure ever <unk> from man.
It's got a <unk> weight to 300 million.
If you <unk> it with a <unk> 10, without spaces, we'll just give a pages to <unk> this code.
Now, how do we do it? How can we <unk>?
Of course, of course, is a game from kids.
It's a little more <unk> when you use bacteria.
It's easier when it's about <unk> cells like our: you can just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> another, which is basically the process of <unk>.
In <unk>, the <unk> is instead of <unk> in the cell, but we've <unk> that we are able to do a <unk> <unk> of a <unk> from a <unk> to another cell and <unk>.
We've <unk> a <unk> <unk> from a species.
<unk> are different <unk> of the men from <unk>.
We've got a few <unk> in a way that we could decide which to choose this <unk>.
He then <unk> it with <unk> so that we could <unk> all the <unk>.
And when we put it in the cell, and we <unk> our <unk> <unk> the new <unk> went into the cell.
And we had to <unk> that we didn't go beyond, but we tried to <unk> more in there.
This is one of the major <unk> of evolution.
We've discovered that <unk> species have <unk> a second or a third <unk> somewhere, <unk> in a second thousands of new <unk> to that species.
So who think about evolution as a only <unk> at time that <unk> has no <unk> of biology.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> that was in the cell, they didn't get one.
The <unk> <unk> that we <unk> it.
It <unk>, and it <unk> the other <unk> as <unk> material, has <unk> it, and we <unk> with only the cell and the new <unk>.
It's become blue because of the genes we've <unk>.
And in a short <unk> of time, all the <unk> of a species went <unk>, and it <unk> of all the <unk> into a new species, <unk> on the new software that we <unk> in the cell.
All the <unk> are <unk>, the <unk> are <unk>, and when you <unk> the code that we <unk>.
Now, this may seem <unk>, but we can <unk> the software, but we can change the software enough.
Now, I've already <unk> that there is no <unk> to <unk> -- but of progress from <unk> three and a half million years of evolution, and I've already said that we're going to create a new version of the <unk> <unk> that we <unk> new species on this digital process.
Why do that?
I think it's quite <unk> when we think about our <unk>.
We're going to go to six and a half billion people in <unk> billion people in the next 40 years.
Just to give one example: I was born in <unk>.
Now there are three people on the planet to <unk> <unk> in <unk>; in the <unk>, in the <unk>.
We're <unk> problems now to find food, <unk> and <unk>, <unk> <unk> for six billion and a half and a half of people.
We're going to be more <unk> to do it for nine billion.
<unk> over five billion <unk>, over 30 billion <unk> <unk>.
That means 100 million <unk> a day.
When we try to find <unk> <unk>, or any kind of process to <unk>, it's a huge challenge.
<unk> we have to realize that we have to <unk> the whole <unk> of CO2 from these materials that <unk> in the atmosphere.
And so now, because of the <unk> <unk> <unk> around the world, we have a <unk> with about 20 million genes, and I like to think that are the <unk> <unk> for the future.
The <unk> industry <unk> only one <unk> about <unk>, and think about how many different things are <unk> out.
Our <unk> here is <unk> data from the reality of <unk> and from our imagination.
Now we have <unk>, because of these <unk> <unk> <unk>, able to create what we call <unk> <unk>.
We're able to build a big robot that can produce a million <unk> a day.
Think of <unk> these 20 million genes or <unk> to try to <unk> <unk> to produce <unk> or <unk>, new <unk>, we can change, with a small team, and create <unk> biology now that in the last 20 years of science.
And it's simply a standard <unk>.
We can choose to <unk> <unk>, chemistry or <unk>, <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
This is a <unk> of some <unk> software that we're working on to be able to <unk> and design species to the computer.
Well, we don't know how they will be.
We know exactly how their code is.
We're now <unk> on the <unk> generation.
You also saw that <unk> from the <unk> was a <unk> experiment.
We have <unk> second and third generation that we're going to be <unk> from <unk> to <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> as the <unk> or different kinds of <unk>.
But the only way that biology can have a great impact without <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the <unk> would be <unk> CO2 in matter before, we're working for design cells that can achieve that we can do that, and we think we can have the first <unk> generation in about 18 months.
<unk> <unk> with CO2 is a <unk> but in our <unk> of <unk> around the world, we found different <unk>.
This is a <unk> that we <unk> in <unk>.
<unk> in the ocean, about <unk> feet of <unk> at the <unk> of water.
<unk> <unk> from CO2 using hydrogen <unk> as a source of energy.
We're trying to figure out if we can <unk> CO2, which can be <unk> by <unk>, <unk> that <unk> CO2 in <unk>, to drive this process.
So, I think that we might be able to <unk> what the basic question is, "What is life, we, we have the <unk> goal of <unk> the whole industry.
<unk>. If you can't do it from TED, where you can't do it?
It's a source of energy.
<unk>, we're working for the same <unk> to create <unk>.
You saw this year with flu, we've always been back a year and with a dollar in less when it's about finding the right <unk>.
I think that you can change it as <unk> <unk>.
That's how the future could could start <unk>, now, the tree of evolution, <unk> the tree with bacteria, <unk>, <unk> cells.
We are so much about <unk> people.
Our purpose is to make a long enough of living enough to try to <unk>. Thank you very much.
First of all, I'm going to show you, the <unk> possible, some <unk>, of new technology that we brought to a <unk> <unk> to a <unk> almost a year ago. This is <unk>.
This is a environment where you can <unk> is at local level that you can <unk> with a huge amount of <unk> data.
Here we're seeing <unk> <unk> of <unk> with a kind of <unk> <unk> and <unk>, for a fast <unk>, <unk> the images like we want.
And it doesn't matter how big the amount of information that we see, how big these <unk> are <unk> of data or images.
Most of them are <unk> photographs, but this example is a <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of <unk>, and <unk> in the <unk> of 300 <unk>.
It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that <unk> the <unk> of a system like this is the number of <unk> on your screen at any time. It's also a very <unk> architecture.
This is a whole book, example of data not from images.
This is the <unk> <unk>. Every <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk>.
To <unk> that it's a <unk> and not of <unk>, we can do something of the kind of thing, to actually <unk> that's a real <unk>, not a picture.
It could be a little <unk> way to read a book.
I won't tell you.
This is a more <unk> example. This is a number of The <unk>.
Every picture is the beginning of a <unk>.
And it really gives you the <unk> and the beautiful experience of read the real <unk> version of a <unk> or of a <unk>, which is for nature a <unk>.
We also did something with the corner of this particular number of The <unk>.
We created a <unk> <unk> <unk> much <unk> than that you use in a normal <unk>, and we've <unk> that <unk>.
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk>, you can see here.
Or some <unk>, or even the <unk> <unk>.
And that really <unk> some of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of space on the screen.
<unk> that <unk> to <unk> and other <unk> like that, <unk>, not to be <unk>.
Of course, the <unk> is one of the most <unk> <unk> for this kind of technology.
And on this, I don't want to lose time, if we don't say we have <unk> to give even <unk> in this field.
These are all the streets in the U.S. <unk> above a NASA <unk>.
So now I'm going to do it to something else.
This is actually in live on the web; you can see it.
This is a project called <unk>, which <unk> two different technologies.
One is <unk> and the other is a <unk> research that was very interesting that <unk> <unk>, a student of the <unk> of Washington, with the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And it's alive in the web, <unk> by <unk>.
You can see when we do this kind of <unk>, where we can go from a picture to the other and have this kind of experience <unk>.
But the <unk> <unk> of the images here has actually a meaning.
The <unk> of <unk> in the computer have <unk> these pictures together, so that they <unk> to the <unk> <unk> in which the <unk> <unk> all closer to the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> have been <unk>. Here you see some <unk> or <unk>, and these things have been <unk>.
I don't know if I have time to show you some other environment.
There are much more <unk>.
I want to go directly to one of the <unk> of <unk> data and this <unk> from a <unk> <unk> of <unk> that we've done for the first time, I <unk> to show you what <unk> is really the key behind this technology, the <unk> technology. And it's not as <unk> <unk> to the <unk> that we've <unk> in the website.
We had to <unk> some <unk> <unk> and so on.
This is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> of types of <unk> and <unk> and <unk> of types of <unk> and so on. And so on. And so on.
So, they're all <unk> images and have been <unk> and you're all <unk> at the <unk> level in this way.
And it's possible to <unk> this way.
You know, I never thought I'd end up work to <unk>.
It's very <unk> to <unk> this kind of <unk> here.
I think you can see that this is a lot of different kinds of <unk>: from those cell to those <unk> <unk>, a <unk> number, <unk> in this environment.
And if I can, I can <unk> those <unk>.
Many of them are <unk> by <unk>, etc.
And somewhere here you find a series of photographs -- <unk>.
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We can go from <unk> to the physical environment.
The point is that we can do things with social environment. This is now <unk> data from <unk> from the whole memory of how to <unk> the earth, from the <unk> point of view and <unk> all of that data together.
All of those pictures are <unk> together, more than the parts.
You have a model of the land that <unk>.
Think about this as the <unk> of <unk> work on Earth.
It's something that <unk> in <unk> complexity as people as <unk> it, and the <unk> that you <unk> with the use.
Their pictures are <unk> with <unk> <unk> from other people.
If somebody comes to <unk> all these <unk> <unk> the name, my picture, my <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> of all that data, and I can use it as I <unk> to <unk> in that space, using the <unk> of anybody else, and have a social experience of <unk> and <unk>.
Of course, a <unk> of all that are very <unk> <unk> of the land, <unk> not only from <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and similar, but from the <unk> <unk>.
Thank you.
CA: I got it right? What your software <unk> us to do is that at some point, in the next few years, all the photographs from anybody in the world's world going to be <unk> together?
<unk>: Yes. What's doing is it basically <unk>.
It's creating <unk>, if you want, between images.
And it's doing it on the content of images.
The thing becomes very interesting if you think of the <unk> information that many of these <unk> images.
As you do a <unk> of images on the web, you <unk> a <unk> and the page on page page has a lot of information about the images.
Now, what happens if that picture <unk> to all your picture?
So the amount of <unk> <unk> and the amount of <unk> that <unk> is really enormous. It's a <unk> effect of the network.
CA: <unk>, it's really incredible. <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>. Thank you very much.
One of the main <unk> when you <unk> and one of the <unk> research is the <unk> that we can live in who has no <unk> <unk>, in the <unk> past in the wind, the <unk> <unk> of plants.
You might think that <unk> <unk> <unk> still beyond the <unk> <unk>, or the <unk> of <unk> are still <unk> of <unk>, or <unk>, <unk> <unk> still the <unk> of <unk>, <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, and that the idea that the world in which we don't exist in any sense, but it's a model of reality, but it's only a model of the reality of,
the <unk> of a particular particular <unk> of <unk> choices that our <unk> did, or bad, a lot of <unk> does.
And, of course, everybody <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>. <unk>.
We're <unk> to <unk>.
We have to <unk> the <unk> of death, so we don't <unk> it if we <unk> and <unk> --
We all have a art.
What <unk> is the particular <unk> of the song, the <unk> of every culture.
It doesn't matter that matter that's the <unk> of <unk>, or the <unk> of <unk> <unk>, or <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk>, <unk> <unk>, or a <unk> in the <unk>'s heart.
He was my <unk> journey in <unk> a month ago, or a <unk> of <unk> in the <unk> of <unk>, on <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>'s mother of the world.
All of these <unk> us that there are other ways of <unk> other ways of thinking, other ways of moving in the world.
And if you take a moment, it's a concept that can give you hope.
<unk>, the <unk> of the world create a <unk> of life and <unk> that <unk> the planet and it's important for the <unk> of the planet, as the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And you can think of this <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and you can <unk> the <unk> of all the <unk>, <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of all the <unk>, <unk> in being from the <unk> of <unk>.
The <unk> is the fantastic <unk> of humanity.
It's the <unk> of what we are and what we can be as <unk> species.
And <unk> the <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, for example, <unk> that 50 percent of all species has been or is on the <unk> of <unk> because it's <unk>, or on the <unk> of <unk> -- in the <unk> of <unk> diversity -- and you don't even <unk> to the <unk> <unk> -- that of the <unk> diversity.
The <unk> of that is, of course, the <unk> <unk>.
When you're <unk> <unk> <unk> on this planet.
A language is not just a <unk> or from a series of <unk> rules.
One is the <unk> of the human spirit.
It's the half the <unk> that the <unk> of every culture is coming in in the world.
Every language is a forest of the mind, a <unk>, a <unk> of <unk>.
And of those <unk> <unk>, as we're sitting here in <unk>, at least half, it doesn't get <unk> in the <unk> of kids.
They don't get to the kids, which means to say, unless you do something, which are already death.
What's more <unk> than being <unk> by <unk>, of being the last one language, the last to talk to a language, of not having a way to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of the <unk>?
This <unk> <unk> has been the state of somebody in the world every two weeks: every two a <unk> <unk> and <unk> with themselves in the <unk> of a <unk> language.
And I know that somebody of you say, "<unk>'t it."
The world wouldn't be a better place if we could all the same language? "<unk>, then we're all going to <unk>.
<unk> <unk>.
<unk> of a <unk> thing means that we can't talk to your language.
I'd like to like to you today, I'd like to give you a journey --
a small journey in the <unk> to give you a <unk> of what we're <unk>.
Many of us are <unk> that when I say, "I mean," I really mean, "I really mean," I really mean, "different ways of <unk>."
So, for example, this <unk> <unk>, in <unk> <unk>, the <unk> of <unk>, which <unk> to the <unk> of <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's a <unk> that it's not able to <unk> the blue color from the <unk> because the <unk> <unk> in the forest, where the <unk>.
They have a <unk> language and a rule rule, <unk> <unk>.
All of that <unk> in the past <unk>, though, the <unk> is that in these <unk> families that they talk about six or seven <unk> because of the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
You start listening to and then I'm going to talk to.
And one of the most interesting <unk> that I lived with, the <unk> of <unk> <unk>, an incredible <unk> that had the first <unk> in <unk>.
In <unk> five <unk> have <unk> a <unk> contact <unk>.
They did the top photographs that <unk> them in <unk> that <unk> <unk>, <unk> that this <unk> of the <unk> forest had never seen anything.
They've <unk> the picture from land, <unk> it to find a form or a <unk> and, you don't have any, they have <unk> that <unk> <unk>, and they <unk> the five <unk> with <unk>.
But the <unk> didn't just <unk> the <unk>.
They <unk> to each other.
<unk> percent of the <unk> was <unk> by their own.
We were <unk> to eight <unk> and we found two <unk> of death, and when we <unk> to know, they've <unk> that one of them was so <unk> who died, and then they <unk> it.
<unk> were able to recognize the animal <unk> from 40 <unk> and to <unk> the species.
<unk> early '<unk>, I had been <unk> a really interesting task when my <unk> <unk> <unk> me if I wanted to go to <unk> between society in the basis of <unk> and <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> to do the <unk>.
To give a sense of <unk>, I should have to understand the <unk> culture and that the <unk> is not <unk> <unk>.
It's quite a <unk> view of the world.
Very interesting.
If you <unk> the great <unk> of the world <unk>, what do you do?
<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, etc.
<unk> is always left out, thinking that Africa <unk> didn't have <unk> <unk>. And instead of <unk> is not the <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk>.
What makes the <unk> is the <unk> relationship between life and death.
So <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> can be <unk> by <unk> <unk>, <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk>.
So, in the <unk> <unk> to say, "<unk> go to <unk> God.
We <unk> in <unk> and <unk> God. "
And from the moment that you're <unk>, is the spirit that <unk> you, how do you get you <unk>?
So, you <unk> to these incredible events: <unk> <unk> in the state of <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a rather <unk> of the power of the mind of the power of the mind, when it's <unk> in a state of <unk>.
<unk> all the <unk> that I lived with the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, in the <unk> <unk>.
<unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> that once <unk> on the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> in the <unk> of <unk>, the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk>.
In a <unk> continent of blood, this <unk> never had been <unk> by <unk>.
In <unk>, I'm <unk> by a <unk>, but their education is extraordinary.
<unk> <unk> are <unk> from <unk> to <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> to the bottom of the <unk> for 18 years.
Two <unk> of nine years <unk> of the way to <unk> the nine months of <unk> that <unk> in the <unk> of <unk>.
For that time, they're <unk> to the values of their society, values that <unk> their <unk> and only their <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or to say, <unk> <unk>.
At the <unk> of this incredible <unk>, they're <unk> out and for the first time in their life, they see a <unk>. And in that moment of the first <unk>, when the sun <unk> <unk>, everything they have learned in theory of the first <unk>, when the sun <unk> <unk>, everything they have learned in theory of his <unk>. <unk> <unk>, everything that have learned in theory of his <unk>. The <unk> <unk> <unk>, what <unk> does a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
"<unk>? <unk> like I told you.
It's <unk>. Now it's in you <unk>. "
They call <unk> <unk> and say that we, <unk> <unk>, we are the <unk> of the world's <unk>.
This is a <unk> level is extremely important.
When we think of <unk> <unk> and the <unk> environment and the <unk> <unk> and the old history of <unk>, which is a <unk> concept in his <unk> or maybe <unk> <unk> and say that these <unk> are <unk> to the Earth of us.
<unk> <unk> are not <unk> or <unk> <unk> from <unk>.
There is no space for these things in the <unk> <unk> or in the <unk> <unk> of <unk>, but because of time and <unk>, have created a <unk> of the Earth <unk> <unk> not on the concept of <unk> <unk> <unk>. The concept of <unk> <unk>. The concept that the Earth can live only because it is <unk> from human consciousness.
What does that mean?
I mean that a <unk> of <unk> that <unk> <unk> that the mountain is a <unk> spirit that <unk> its <unk> will be a human being <unk> <unk> different. And it will have a very different relationship with the mountain or that place is a <unk> of <unk> that <unk> that <unk> that a mountain <unk> that <unk> that <unk> <unk> that a <unk> that <unk> <unk> that a mountain <unk> to be <unk>.
<unk> is a <unk> of a spirit or a <unk> <unk> is <unk>.
What's interesting is the <unk> that <unk> the relationship between <unk> and the natural world.
I grew up in the <unk> of <unk> <unk> that the <unk> <unk> to be <unk>.
That made me a human being different from my friends who believe that <unk> are the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> that live in the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk>.
If you start <unk> that these <unk> can create reality, <unk> to start understanding some of their <unk> <unk>. They can start this <unk>.
I took this picture to <unk> in the <unk> <unk>.
<unk> some of you have heard about <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
What makes the <unk> is not the potential of <unk> of <unk>, but its <unk>. It's <unk> by two elements.
On one hand, this <unk> <unk> that has a series of <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
<unk> the only <unk> a <unk> that <unk> a little bit of <unk> that <unk>, but it's <unk> with a <unk> of a <unk>'s family <unk> <unk>.
This <unk> <unk> <unk>, very similar to <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
If you ever see the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> that's <unk> the <unk> <unk>.
<unk> that <unk> on the <unk> is a little bit like being <unk> by a <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a sea of electricity. It doesn't create a <unk> of reality; it creates the <unk> of reality.
I often <unk> with my <unk>, Richard <unk>, the man who <unk> the <unk> was <unk>, with his discovery of <unk> <unk> in the <unk>.
<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
It's possible to <unk> only <unk> if you <unk> with other <unk> <unk> that <unk>.
Now, the <unk>: <unk> that are in this <unk> are <unk>, of the same guy necessary to <unk> the <unk>. The question <unk> <unk>: in a <unk> of <unk> species of plants, like these <unk> <unk> two <unk> <unk>, but what if you look like this, they're <unk> two <unk> <unk> <unk>. But what if you <unk> in this way, they create a <unk> that's <unk> to the parts?
We use the great <unk> of <unk> and <unk>, which can <unk>.
But if you were to the <unk>, we're going to be "The plants talk about it."
What does that mean?
This <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> in the forest, and that our eyes <unk> in the forest, and that our eyes will <unk> in the same species.
If you tell them how to <unk> their <unk> us, "<unk>" <unk> "<unk>" No. "
The solution is: you take the <unk> <unk> in a night night.
And you don't <unk> to <unk>, but it's much more interesting than <unk> <unk>.
Now, the problem is that the <unk> is that the <unk> of us who have heart <unk> <unk> them, but somehow <unk> to the <unk> of history of history than our real world, and beyond.
In fact, the <unk> century, in 300 years, <unk>, not <unk> <unk> for its <unk> or its <unk> <unk>, but rather as the one was where we <unk> and <unk> <unk> or <unk> the mass of the <unk> diversity and <unk> <unk> of the planet. Now the problem is not the change.
All of the <unk> were <unk> in a <unk> for new <unk> of life.
And the problem is not technology.
<unk> <unk> don't have <unk> to be <unk> when they put <unk> and <unk> as well as <unk> don't have <unk> to be <unk> when they have <unk> from <unk> and <unk>.
It's not the change or the technology that <unk> the <unk> of <unk>. It's the power.
The <unk> <unk> of <unk>.
And if you look at the world, we'll see that these are not <unk> <unk> to <unk>.
They are creatures <unk> and <unk> out of the <unk> forces that go beyond their <unk> <unk>.
<unk> that <unk> <unk> --
a <unk> <unk> of <unk>, in <unk> <unk>, a <unk> that has been <unk> in the forest to a generation ago, and now <unk> to the <unk> <unk>, where you can see the <unk> from the <unk> that <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk>,
<unk> to <unk> the <unk> with the <unk> <unk> to the forest.
Or, in the <unk> case, are the diseases that are <unk> with the <unk> discovery of <unk>.
If you take a <unk> <unk>, where I'm doing a lot of research, you'll see the <unk> of politics.
As a <unk>, <unk> physics of a <unk>, is <unk> at the <unk> level, but the <unk>, the <unk> of life of a <unk>, not only is <unk>, but <unk> in some <unk>, because it's part of the development of <unk>.
And you can't understand the <unk> of <unk> until you go from the beginning.
I got the <unk> miles from <unk> in the <unk> <unk>, <unk> to <unk> with a young <unk>, but only got to <unk> what's behind.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> million people <unk> from the <unk> during the <unk> <unk>.
The father of this guy was <unk> at <unk> <unk>.
which means that it was <unk> in Chinese times.
<unk> <unk> is <unk> with <unk> <unk> during the <unk> that led to <unk> in <unk>.
My mother was <unk> and her <unk> was to be <unk>.
It was taken of <unk> in <unk> at age two <unk> under his <unk> because he couldn't have to live without him.
The <unk>, who did the same, was <unk> in <unk>.
One day, she <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> and, for this <unk>, was <unk> to the <unk> work for seven years.
The <unk> pain can be <unk>, but the <unk> spirit of <unk> is from <unk> present.
And then, all of that <unk> to a choice.
<unk> we want to live in the <unk> world or want to <unk> the <unk> world of diversity?
The great <unk> <unk> <unk>, before he died that his greatest fear was that, in our <unk> to this <unk> view of the world, not only <unk> the entire human imagination of imagination to a <unk> <unk> of thinking, but a day it <unk> us that there were other <unk>.
And it's <unk> to remember that our species is <unk> for <unk> years.
The <unk> <unk>, who gave us agriculture, which <unk> us, which <unk> us to the <unk> of the <unk> with the <unk> of <unk>, creating the <unk> of <unk>, creating the <unk> of <unk>, and we talk about <unk> years ago.
The <unk> world has to <unk> 300 years.
That <unk> story, I didn't tell me that we have the answers to all the challenges that we can face in the <unk> to come.
When we <unk> the world is asked what it means to be human, we're asking to say, we're going to <unk> with <unk> different <unk>.
And it's in these answers that we all <unk> the possibility of being what we are: a <unk> species, that has to <unk> all the <unk> can <unk>. And there are great moments of <unk>.
I took this picture on the <unk> of <unk> island, when I went to <unk> <unk> with <unk>, and this man, <unk> me the wonderful story of her <unk>.
The <unk> government was not always <unk> with the <unk> <unk> and in the '<unk> to <unk> our <unk>, we <unk> them in <unk>.
The <unk> of this man <unk> <unk>.
The family, <unk> for her life, <unk> her <unk> all the <unk>, and all of his <unk>.
You want to know that <unk> don't <unk> the cold, <unk>.
The <unk> of <unk> <unk> fish were made of <unk> fish in skin of <unk>.
The <unk> of this man didn't <unk> from night or from the <unk> that <unk>.
It's <unk> away, it <unk> the <unk> in <unk> and <unk> in your hand. When I did it, she <unk> it, she <unk> it up, she <unk> it to create a <unk>.
It <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk> of <unk> and when <unk> <unk>, <unk> a dog.
He <unk> the dog and created a <unk>, with the <unk> <unk> created a <unk>, has <unk> another dog, and she's <unk> on the <unk>, <unk> in <unk>.
<unk> to talk about <unk> with anything? [<unk>] And that, in different ways, [<unk>] is the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and all the <unk> <unk> in the world.]
<unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> government <unk> to the total <unk> of an area of <unk> bigger than California California and <unk> together.
It's their new <unk>. It's called <unk>.
It's a <unk> <unk>. It <unk> all the resources.
One <unk> example of how a <unk> can <unk> with his <unk>.
And, to end, I think it's quite <unk> at least to the <unk> of the <unk> areas of the planet, that they don't understand at all.
For somebody is home.
<unk> <unk> of human imagination that <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk>. And for us all, the dreams of these kids, as the dreams of our children, they become part of the <unk> of hope.
And finally, we're <unk> that <unk> <unk> that <unk> never <unk> to anything.
<unk> that <unk> --
<unk> <unk> are not <unk>, but we believe that stories can change the world, and maybe we are the best <unk> to tell the stories of the world. Every month our <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> million <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> our <unk> <unk>.
Our <unk> are <unk> by millions of people.
Our work is <unk> in <unk> to bring our public in <unk> to <unk> <unk> from which <unk> from <unk> how they saw and, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> for <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, the <unk> world in diversity, and we have to find a <unk> <unk> in a <unk> world.
where all the <unk> can <unk> to our <unk> <unk>.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope you've already heard and <unk> to <unk> some <unk>, in case you didn't get them.
I want to start with what I call "the <unk> <unk>."
The <unk> <unk> of what?
The <unk> <unk> of all <unk> society. The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>: "If we want to <unk> the <unk> of our citizens." The way to do it is <unk> the freedom. "
The reason is, on one hand hand, in fact that freedom is to itself a value, is <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> for humans beings.
On the other one is in the fact that if we're <unk>, each of us can act to do everything that we <unk> our <unk>, without any one that <unk> in name.
The way to <unk> the freedom is to <unk>.
The more choices, the more <unk> are <unk>, and the <unk> of their <unk>, the <unk> is their <unk>.
This, <unk>, <unk>, is so <unk> <unk> in society that no one <unk> to <unk>.
And it's also <unk> <unk> in our lives.
I'm going to show you some examples of what progress made possible.
This is my <unk>. It's not particularly great.
I got a simple note on the <unk> to <unk>.
In my <unk>, there are <unk> <unk>, without <unk> the 10 <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that you can buy for you a huge number of <unk> in the <unk> that you can buy for you a huge number of <unk> in the <unk> that no one of <unk> in your <unk> that no one of the <unk> <unk> <unk> of your <unk>.
That's what the <unk> is.
Then you go to the <unk> store to buy a <unk>: <unk>, <unk>, radio, <unk>, <unk>, radio, <unk>, <unk>.
And in this single <unk> store, there's a great number of <unk> <unk>.
We can do six million different <unk> with <unk> that there are in a <unk>.
<unk> <unk> that there is <unk>.
<unk>: The world of <unk>.
Once, when I was a child, you could all the <unk> services, <unk> that were <unk> by <unk> <unk>.
You <unk> the phone, you don't <unk> it.
And a <unk> of that, between the other one was that the phone to be <unk>.
These days, they went.
We now have a <unk> almost <unk> of <unk>, especially in cell phones.
Here's the cell phones from the future.
My <unk> is in the middle, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, and <unk> for the <unk> <unk>.
If you don't have seen it in the <unk> store under your house, you're very <unk> that soon.
And what is the answer happens is that people <unk> to <unk> and ask this question. And you know, what is the answer? The answer is, "No."
You can't buy a cell phone that doesn't do things.
So, in other <unk> of life that are much more important than <unk>, you <unk> the same <unk> of choices.
<unk> <unk>: <unk>, not happens in the United States that you <unk> from <unk> and the <unk> you what you have to do.
Instead, <unk> from <unk>, and the <unk> says, "OK, we could do it." Or you could do it. "Or you," A has these <unk>, "<unk> has these <unk> and these <unk>. What do you want to do?"
You were the <unk>, "<unk>, what do you do?"
And the <unk> says, "A has these <unk> and these <unk>, and <unk> has these <unk> and these <unk>."
"What do you want to do?"
And you said, "<unk> if you were me, what do you do?"
And the <unk>: "But I'm not her."
The result of <unk>, we call it "<unk>", "<unk>" <unk> "," <unk> "," <unk> "," <unk> "," <unk> "," <unk> "," <unk> "," <unk> "," <unk> that makes it a nice thing.
But it's not that one <unk> the weight and the responsibility and the responsibility of the <unk> of the <unk> of something, <unk> the <unk>, to <unk> that no -- and of course, is <unk> -- and so not in the <unk> to make the patient.
There's a huge <unk> of <unk> products, <unk> to people like me and you, that if you think that doesn't make sense, because we can't <unk>.
But if we can't <unk>, why do we <unk>?
The answer is that they want you to <unk> the <unk> to <unk> the <unk>.
<unk> of so fundamental as our <unk> is now a choice of choice, how you see in this <unk>. "We don't want to <unk> kids. We don't want to <unk> kids. <unk> their sex now."
And we can <unk> how many times we <unk>.
which means that every <unk>, <unk>, you have to decide that kind of want to be.
<unk> to the family and <unk>, a common time perspective, <unk> almost for anybody, was that <unk> the <unk> as possible, and you start to <unk> the <unk> as soon as possible.
The only real choice was with who, not when, and even what to do after.
<unk>, everything is really to play.
<unk> to be very smart students, and they <unk> their 20 percent <unk> than work at a time.
And not because they're not <unk>, not because they're <unk>.
But why are they <unk>, <unk> to <unk>: "<unk> <unk> or not? <unk> it? <unk> or not?"
"<unk> <unk> later? I have to think about the kids or to career?"
I'm <unk> <unk>.
And they try to answer these questions, even if this <unk> doesn't <unk> the <unk> that <unk> and not get a good <unk> to my <unk>.
And they have to do that. They're important questions.
Now, the work: we're <unk>, as <unk> <unk>, because the technology allows us to work every minute, every day, from the <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, there's a <unk>, and I won't tell anybody which, where the <unk> works.
I don't tell you, because I want to use it.
What does this mean, this incredible freedom of choice that we have about work? Is it we have to decide, <unk> at any time, if we have to work or not.
We can go to see our child play <unk>, with the cell in a <unk>, the other, and the <unk>, <unk>.
And even if I're all <unk>, every minute we see our son, <unk> the <unk>, we're also <unk>, "I have to answer this call?"
"<unk> to this <unk>? I have to <unk> this? I have a letter?"
And even when the answer is no, "that all of the <unk> experience of your child very different from what would be in other conditions.
So, from all of the small and <unk>, <unk>, the <unk>, the life is a question of choices.
Once the world was this: <unk>, there were some possibilities, but it was not a matter of choice.
The world of today is <unk> to this: <unk> is, "Is it a <unk> thing, or <unk>?"
The answer is <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> we all know, so I'm going to talk about the <unk>.
<unk> this choice is two effects of <unk> people.
The first one, <unk>, is that <unk> instead of <unk>.
With a lot of <unk> between which <unk>, it becomes very difficult to do it.
I'll give you an example of <unk>: a study <unk> on <unk> <unk>.
A <unk> of mine had access to <unk> data, <unk> <unk>'s <unk>, with <unk> <unk>'s about a million <unk> <unk> in <unk>.
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are <unk> in more, the <unk> of <unk> <unk> two percent.
With 50 <unk> <unk>, there's 10 percent in less than <unk> when they are available. Why?
Because with 50 <unk> of which <unk>, is <unk> difficult to decide, and choice is <unk> to <unk>.
And <unk>, and course, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and of course, <unk> never comes to.
<unk> that doesn't mean just that these <unk> <unk> food to <unk> because they don't have enough money, it means that the decision <unk> is so <unk> that <unk> the decision <unk> of work.
They don't <unk>, they're <unk> to <unk> <unk> for the year from <unk> <unk> of work, which would be <unk> to <unk>.
So <unk> is a <unk> of <unk> choices.
And I think that's going to be the world.
"And to end, <unk>: <unk>, <unk> or <unk>?"
You really want to make the right decision, if it's for <unk>, right?
You don't want to choose the wrong bottom, and <unk> the wrong <unk>.
So this is the first effect. The second is that even if we can <unk> the <unk> and make a choice, at the end, we're less <unk> from the result of how you have been with <unk>.
And that's why.
One of them is that with many <unk> of which <unk>, if you take one and it's not perfect, it's easy to imagine that you could make a different choice that could have been better. And what the <unk> <unk> <unk> us to <unk> the <unk> of choice, and the <unk> <unk> the <unk> decision,
even when it was a <unk> decision.
The more choices there are, the <unk> of any <unk> that's <unk> of the choice.
<unk>, there is what <unk> call.
Dan <unk> has <unk> very well <unk> like the value of the value that we give things to things that we <unk>.
<unk> else, when there are a lot of <unk> possible, it's easy to <unk> the <unk> <unk> of <unk> and <unk> and being less than the <unk> that you have choice.
Here's an example. I'm <unk> with everybody who's not in New York.
But that's what you probably do.
There's this <unk> to the <unk>.
A <unk> place.
<unk> <unk>. <unk> day. It's all for them.
I don't <unk> anything. But what he thinks is, "Well, <unk>, <unk>, it's <unk>."
"All my <unk> <unk> are away."
"<unk> <unk> <unk> in front of home."
And it goes two weeks, from the idea that's <unk> -- every day -- the chance of <unk> where it wants.
The <unk> <unk> for what we have, even when the choice was <unk>.
And the more the <unk> we have from <unk>, the more the <unk> <unk> you <unk> against how to <unk>.
Here's another example.
This <unk> tells us a lot of things.
It took us to live the moment, and maybe the time.
But the most important point is that anything you are, you're going to be <unk> to do other.
The things that don't <unk> have a lot of <unk> that can make less <unk> what we do.
<unk>: <unk> <unk>.
I tried it on my skin <unk> a new <unk>.
It's going to be <unk>.
Once the <unk> were just a guy, <unk> them and <unk>, they were <unk>, only after <unk>, they were <unk>, only after <unk> a life and <unk> a lot of times, <unk> to go well.
So, I went to <unk> a couple of when the <unk>, and I said, "I need a couple of <unk>, this is my <unk>."
The <unk> said to me, "You want to <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>?"
You want them to <unk> or <unk>?
"<unk> them want to <unk>?"
"<unk> <unk> them want to <unk> or <unk>? <unk> <unk>..." <unk> to <unk>. "
I was <unk>, and after a while I got a little bit of saying, "I want the guy to -- which was the only guy." He had no idea what he was, so for a time. And then I got to <unk> <unk>, and then you get from the <unk>, <unk>, with the best <unk> I ever had.
It was the <unk>. With all that choice I had <unk> the best.
But I'm <unk> worse.
Why? I wrote a whole book for <unk>.
The reason I was worse is that with all that choice my <unk> were <unk>, the <unk> <unk> to be <unk>.
At first, I had <unk> <unk>. I didn't <unk> anything about <unk> when I was only one guy. But when you had to 100 different, you know, at least one guy had to be perfect.
What I had <unk> was good, but not perfect.
After I <unk> that <unk> with what I was <unk> in <unk> to <unk>.
The <unk> of <unk> in life, it doesn't make the <unk> that these have respect to the <unk> of the <unk> themselves.
And this <unk> <unk>, even when the results are good.
No one in the world of <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Because if you <unk> it, I don't know what I'm talking about.
The truth <unk> to this.
"And he was better when he was worse." The reason why he was was <unk> when he was worse, when he was worse, when he was worse, you know, "<unk> <unk>."
<unk>, in the world that we live in -- <unk>, <unk> citizens with the <unk> of <unk> -- the <unk> that we can <unk> is that things are at the <unk>.
You never have to <unk> you <unk> because your <unk>, my <unk>, <unk>.
The <unk> of happiness -- that you're here -- is, "<unk> <unk>" Yes, that you want it. "
I mean, small moment <unk> -- that I'm really <unk> and my wife is really <unk>.
I couldn't do it, I didn't have to do it.
But <unk> is not always a <unk> thing.
<unk>, a <unk> of <unk> <unk> when there's only that kind of <unk> is that when you're not <unk>, and you say, "Why?"
"Who is <unk>?" The answer is <unk>.
The world is <unk>. What could I do?
When there are hundreds of <unk>, and you get a <unk>, and you'll <unk> who's the <unk>, it's clear that the <unk> you are.
You could have done it better.
With hundreds of <unk> available, there are no <unk> for the <unk>.
So when people make decisions, even if the result is <unk>, they <unk> and they give the <unk> to themselves.
In the last few years, the <unk> <unk> world.
I think a <unk> <unk> -- not the only, but important -- of this <unk> of <unk> is that people have experiences because <unk> are too <unk>.
And when they have to <unk> this situation, they think the <unk> is them.
So the final result is that in general we're better, but we're going to get worse.
Let me show you.
This is the <unk> <unk>, what we all take for it and it's completely <unk>.
There is no <unk> that a little bit of choice is better than <unk>, but from this is not a <unk> that much choice is better than a little bit.
There's a <unk> value, <unk>. I don't know what it is.
But I'm quite sure we've <unk> from a piece of the level where the choices <unk> our life.
Now, from the <unk> point of view -- I almost finished -- from the point of view, the <unk> is the <unk>.
What allows you to do is in <unk> society is the <unk> material.
There are many places in the world, and you have to be <unk> <unk>, where the problem is not that they have <unk> choice.
The problem is they have too <unk>.
So the <unk> that I'm talking about is a <unk> <unk> of <unk>, <unk> society.
And what <unk> does, and <unk> is this: <unk> <unk> <unk> to you tell how much you and <unk> <unk> to <unk> are <unk>. It's a <unk> of money.
I mean that these choices, <unk> and <unk>, it's not that they're simply <unk>.
I'm <unk> <unk>.
They're worse.
If a little of what in our society <unk> choice was <unk> in the people that had too few <unk>, it would not only be their life to <unk>, but also our.
This is what <unk> call.
A <unk> of <unk> income, not only -- the poor -- because of this choice in <unk> that <unk> us.
And to end, "<unk>, you can become everything you want to --
<unk>, people of culture, <unk>: "What do that?"
"It's <unk> that you can't make anything in a glass <unk>."
"A <unk> imagination, a <unk> vision of the world --"
and I <unk> it like this, at the beginning.
But then, I realized that that the fish knows.
Because the reality of <unk> is that if you <unk> the <unk>, <unk>, so that "you can't <unk> the freedom. You <unk> the freedom.
If you <unk> the <unk> so that it would be <unk> to <unk>.
<unk> the <unk>, and <unk> <unk>.
Everybody needs a <unk>.
This is almost certainly too <unk>, maybe even for the fish, and certainly for us.
But the <unk> of a few <unk> <unk> is a <unk> for <unk> and, <unk>, <unk>, for <unk>.
Thank you very much.
