And last year, I showed these slide to show that the tears that the tears of artical type of 48 million years has had had the size of 48 percent has had restreten in the United States of 40 percent of the 40 percent of the United States of 40 percent of the tearly glacial years.
But this is the gravity of the problem because it doesn't show the slips of ice because it doesn't show the ice of the ice --
The typical climb is, in a sense, the clean heart heart heart of the global climate system.
You expands of the summer and return out of summer and returns.
The next slide will be a couple of the last 25 years.
The gaus lose are signed in red red red it.
You see it as a see, you expanding up to the blue scen.
That's the ice in winter winter -- which is the summer retyed.
You can see that the coside of five years or more, five years or more, it's like the blood that fully smoke, which was out of the body.
In 25 years was passed by this for a year like this.
This is a problem because the climate climate terrain the art of the arttic where there are enormous amount of carbon dig flocation that scientists are transformed in meters they come from meter in meters and put it into meters in meters and put it into metaphan.
Rispace of the totality of the atmospheric pollution, that amount could be double, the amount of the way it doesn't come back to the outside of the totality could be background of the global warming.

A reason is that this termal exchange in the Greenland is a slips of the northermal Greenland s' switcher of the north.
This is a river, glacial regime glacial river.
The leveled never reached the similar of similar levels.
This is the Kangerlusa-ewest Kangerlusa-eggs of Greenland of Greenland.
If you want to know how the level of the sea level of the gather, you know, here is where the sea level of the sea level of the sea.
These corrupting running increasing rapidly.
Another part of the planet: Antarctarctica, the biggest block of the planet.
The last last month, the scientists have declared that the ballock of ice is negative and that the Antarctica, which is westernal poor, which is particularly rapid in the sheet.
It was a six feet of waters, like Greenland in Greenland in Greenland.
On Himalaya, the third block of ice block of ice block in the laks, who were ice.
40 percent of the world population was recently required half of the polling potakes from the slips.
Sulle Ande: this ice is the source of the water source of this city.
The led is increased up to the carrying is increased.
But when you decent the same thing happens to be a touch of a table.
In California the snow: The snowing is diminitty diminite.
The hydrive is crisis.
The previsions, like you have rected, are grave.
The growing of the world at a remarkable increasing increasing in the world of incendeded.
The environmental disasters are increasing a recording out of the normal and without precedented it.
Four times more numberal years in the last 30 years than the previous previous to the previous previous previous about 75.
This is a sustainable gain of this is a sustainable gather.
If you look at the context of the historical context of them if you can see the consequences.
In the last five years we added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the oceans every day in the oceans every day
Look at the Eastern area of oriental Pacific America, from the west, and on the west, where there's a result of the continent in the ocean.
The most of global warming, together with deforestation, together to the deforestation, which is 20 percent, is the use of fossil fuel.
The oil is a problem, and the carbon is even worse than the worse is even worse.
The United States are one of the countries with more emissions, together, together.
And it proposed to build a lot of other carbon dials.
But we're seeing a change of direction.
These are the projects of alternative projects and few alternative proposites.
At the way, there's a political lotable in our country.
The carbon dioil industries have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote the carbon dioximming carbon dioxidic and that is a oxumor.
And this picture reminded me reminded me reminded me --
Natmal Natmal in Tennesse, where there was a 3.8 billion gers.
You may have seen it on the news of it.
This is the second biggest flowing scories in America.
It's happened around Natmaining Natal.
The natalized publishing one of the carbon industry was this one.
Video: She will be a carbon dioximate is a kind of like and happy and happy.
It's pretty much in America, and it grow our economy.
Frosty carbon is increasingly clean to clean to be clean.
It's precise, adorable and workers and workers keep the stick.

Video: Ator COALery we see the climate change as a serious climate changes as a threat to our business.
So our priority is to invest a great amount of money in a public effort to make public and confused the truth, confused the truth,
In fact, the carbon is not sport.
We think it's pulled -- it's also a good profum.
So not preocupating of climate change
Let me do you do.
Video: Ator s: Carbon -- you heard about it a lot of it.
So let's take a game, we take a game, and it is about how it is a charcoal carbon.
Straordinary machines are a little noisy, but this is the sound of the technology of charcoal carbon dials.
The carbon dial consuming is between the main causal warming, but the remarkable technology of carbon disease that you see changes everything.
You look look at a charcoal hator technology of charcoal carbon diernal hand.
Al Gore: Fine, the positive alternative alternative and the economic security.

Now, there's a new audition to use.
Repower America: 1000 percent of clean energy in decade.
They plan to stop the work, to make America work, and help us to stop the global warming.
Finally, a solution that you have to solve our problems.
Repower America. It is about it.
Al Gore: This is the ultimate here.

Al Gore: A old African proverbio africh says, "If you want to go to you, go to you, go to you.
If you want to go away away away, you go away with it."
We have to go away quickly, we have to go away --
Thank you very much.
The last year at TED fect in LHC.
And I promise to go back to the back to the flock of how the machine.
So here I got it. And for those who are not the other time there was no her, the LHC is the biggest scientific experimented -- 27 kilometers of circumference.
Her type is to rereck the conditions that were less than a billion of a second from the beginning of the universe -- until 600 million times a second.
All of this is simply environment.
This is the Gineva.
We photographing these mini-Big Bang in relawers.
This is what I work. It's called ATLAS -- it's larger 44 feet and has a diameter diameter of 22 feet of feet and has a 22 feet of feet and has a diameter of 22 feet diameter and has a diameter of 22 feet and have a diameter diameter of 22 feet and has a diameter diameter of 22 feet and have a diameter diameter of 22 feet and have a diameter diameter diameter diameter of 22 feet and two feet and have a meters.
This is a spectacular image of ATLAS in building so you can see proportions.
The 10 of the last year, we have access, we have access, we have access,
And this picture was taken by ATLAS.
It was a lot of unmense-festegments in the control half the control.
It's a picture of the first particles of particles that had done all the way around the LHC, and spread particles and deliberately, with a part of the LHC, and spread particles inside the relaers.
In other words, when we seeed that image 10 of the 10 10 of the machine working, we understand that machine works, which is a great liftyle that is a great liftyle in other words.
I don't know if it was to do it more or to do this -- when someone went to Google and he saw that the page was this --
It means that we had a cultural impact of that scientific impact to the scientific impact.
About a week, there was a problem with the machine, had to these files -- these files -- these files -- these files files.
These files taking 13,000 feet when machine that machine works in the power.
Now, technical technical technical to look at films and say, "It's not true. I'm filming too underlying the too underlying the too underlying files too under the technical files and say, "It's not true. I'm files too under and say, "It's not true.
And they can do it because when they're very quickly become the superconvictions.
So, at less 271 degrees, at a inferior at that space of the space between the stars, these files can bring that corrupt that corrupt of the space between the stars, these files can bring that core.
In one of the most of the magnets in the LHC, there was a defect defect of fabrication defect of reaching in the LHC, there was a defect defect of the most of the magnets in the LHC, there was a defect defect of the most of the magnets of the most of the fabsolution.
So the files are surrises heating and 13,000 feet and 13,000 feet meeting a electrical resistance.
This was the resulted.
Now, this is more impressioning if you think these magnets fish more than 20 tons than 20 tons and have been moved about 30 centimeters.
They are damage damaged about 50 magnets.
We had to take it to you to take it up.
We have repristine and reached them and addition to it.
They're now now going to go back to their place under place to their place under the ground.
And I walks the end of mark LHC is will be again.
We take it to the way and we expect of the data or sets or he goes to go and keep so our adventure to discover what the universe.
Now, of course, in a certain quite a way, these accidents rect accidents and the engineering of science and engineering facility. It's easy to confuture.
I think that the fact that it's so difficult to go beyond the limits, I think it's the value of things like LHC.
I would like to end with the words of a scientist Ingless, Humphrey Davy, which imagined in defense of inutefs of his pupll, his pullay, he said, "No Michael Faray, said, "No it's so dangerous for progress of the human mind as the realm of the human mind of the science that are definitive to the world."
Thank you.
I want to start asking you to rethink about this -- you know, you were playing here, you were playing with matter with matter to the bricks.
As you understand how you reach them and reaching them and realized them and moving them and moving them to think and solve them and solve problems and solve relationships.
The space is deeply of the space that we understand a lot of the world around us.
So from information inspired by the usual usual objects, together, and my consultent objects, and my collaborator Jeevan Kalaniths, I started asking myself to ask mouse the computer, rather than the mouse as well-half as well-digital that moves on a planet, we will deal with with an enterrate with an entissue information with both objects,
and we make it a way to our pleased pleased it to our please.
The question was so interesting that we decided we decided we decided we decided to exploring the answers, building the Siftable.
In poor, a Siftable computer is a great discovered computer computer computer computer computer computer
In poor, a Siftable computer is a great discovered computer computer computer computer computer computer
You can move them with the hand, they can see it in the movement and they have a movement and have a screen and a wireless.
But above all, I'm physical objects, like matter as the matter to be simply to reach them.
The Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem of tools to manipulate the digital information.
And as they become more physics, and more physics, and as they get more physics, and as they become more physics, and as they become more physics, and how we can motion, exploring new and fundamental stiles.
I'm going to start with some example.
This is Sifty to show you that video -- if you including it in a direction, the video will turn out there, if I win the other side back to the other side of the other tanks.
These interactive rhyths are awarens.
If you are in the face they are interested in what they are around it.
If they come circumstom, they notice and they can get a little bit.
If they come circumstom, they notice and they can get a little bit.
They also have their movement and inclining across the movement and clination.
And then we realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was the powering gestures of the interactions like if it was a liquid.
In this case, we have three Siftable Siftable secks of green and I can use them to use them to the color in the central central colors in the central central central of the color.
and I can use them to use them to the color in the central central color, where they mix.
If we can put it a little bit about place.
These are beautiful possibilities of appreciation, like mathematics and plays of logical games where people can try things quickly expensive things and see the immediacy.
Now I'm --
This is a sequence of Fibonacus that I do with a program of equations.
Here we have a game of words that is in half between Scarabeum and Boggle.
Basically, in every turn Siftable, you get a letter on every Table, and I get a letter in every turn of a letter house on every turn Siftable, and while you try to get words on a ditionary.
Then, after about 30 seconds remissing, and you have a new set of reading and new possibilities to try to get a new possibilities to try to try to do.
Thank you.
Here's the kids come to the Media Lab, I did it so that they tried them and slightly slipped a video.
They are pleased a lot of them are pleased for them to like this.
And one of the interesting things about this is that you don't have to give people a lot of education is that you don't have to give people a lot of education.
You have to say, "Compons" Components and exactly what to do.
Here's some other people who tried to do it.
This is our more given tester than younger and right there.
It actually wanted to care about it.
They just were bad, for him.
Now, this is a application of a interactive application carton.
We wanted to build a tool appreciation of the English appreciment of Lui is Felix.
It can put new characters in the scene, and spread Siftable their associated with their associated with them.
It can put new characters in the scene, and spread Siftable their associated with their associated with them.
So it's doing the sun of us.
Video: The sole is smigene.
David Merrill: It has taken a treat in the scene.
Video: The arancient treat.
Bel work!
So you get to the Siftable and put them neighbors can interact the characters --
Video: Bau!
and inventing their story.
Video: Ya!
DM: It's a story with open-open-and can decide as a turn to the way it turns.
DM: It's a story with open-open-and can decide as a turn to the way it turns.
Video: Video: Mevia,
DM: The last example I have time to show you is a tool, realized recently, for sample, and exective music.
it's a tool, recently recently, to sample and execk music.
The Siftable here are fashion, based on like the bacteria.
Each of these has four different variations, and you can choose which use.
You can also inserve these sounds in a sequence to your slide to your please.
And it is to modify it by making a "sound sequence."
These are actually that you can control from living, like reverse and the filter.
The attacks to a particular sound and then including to get it to add it.
And then there are the general effects like time and volumes, which apply to apply in sequence.
We look at how it works.
Video: DM: We're going to start a base in two Sift," we will put a sequence, we system, the extend to be several other base.
Now I put a low-in-in-based line of the inner line.
Video: DM: Oh, I add the percent,
Video: She will put the filter to the bacteria, so I can control the effect from living.
Video: I can take the whole sequence the whole sequence inclining the time from one side or the other.
Video: She will add the movie to the based filter to give more expression.
Video: I can recombine the sequence of the sequence of the sequence of the sequence.
So I don't have to planning it before, but I can try and provising, making it more longer or more shorting it or more short and more short to make it longer or more corty.
And so, finally, I can get the whole sequence inclining the whole sequence inclining the Siftable "volumes."
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is building new interfaces of new interfaces of how our brain and more look like our brain and body.
And I had time to show you one of the results of this paths of this path, and some possibilities that we try to bring out of the laboratory.
The concept that I want to transmit you is coming this new generation of objects for digital objects to interact with digital media that will bring information in our world that we want it.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the time to talk to you about all of you.
They're a writing write of this.
Scing books is my profession, but it's more of this, of course, of course,
It's also the love and the fashine of my life.
And I don't expect that can change it.
But I said, you know, something particularly happened in my life and career in my life, which has led me to realibrate the whole realm of this work.
The thing is that I recently recently written this book, this is called "Mangia, Prega, Ama" -- what I meanmeans out of my previous -- for some reason that was going to be a big sensational, bestset of interaction.
And the result is that everywhere you go back to me as if I was convicted me as if I was convicted to me.
By -- convict: By convict!
They all come to me and do you have to worry and say, "You can't afraid you can't afraid to do better?
You can't afraid to continue to write for all life without could be able to create a book that can be able to create a book that can be able to someone matter to someone who can do you have to do it?"
that can be important to someone who can you do that?"
It's a resure of running away.
But it could go worse, I was going to remind that I think about 20 years ago, when I started to say people -- I was an adolescent -- I wanted to be a write write -- I wanted to be a write write -- I wanted to be a write write about 20 years ago, when I started to say to the people -- I was a write writing that I was a write write -- I was a writing write write -- I
I was going to meet the same reaction.
And people said, "Don't you have successful to have success?
Don't you fear the half of the refloor killed you do?
You can't afraid to do this mester mester for all life without any swimming and die on a heading heavy of skets with the mouth of lots of falt skets with flight?"
So you know, you know.
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is, "Y."
I fear of all those things.
I always had fear I had been fear --
And I also fear of many other things that people might not have to mean to it.
As a and other frightened things like this.
But, as I writing this is what I thought and wonderful is why is it because it is?
Is it rational?
It's logic that anybody who have to be scared by a work that I feel to do a work that you feel to do it.
But what is that particularly in the impresely creative to make us about the mental health mental health worthy in a way that other career doesn't do?
How my father, for example, he was a chemical engineer and I don't remember one time in his 40 years of activity where he was asked to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer it?
It never was -- that there was never -- that the engineer of John, how does it go?
It was not working like this, so it was not going to work?
Onestly, the engineers like group don't have certainly in the centuries, dad the reputation of being alcolized maniaged to be alcohyacks.
And writers, we have enough this reputation, and not just writers and not just creative writers but creative to be enormously unstable.
And it's not rest that looks at the contains of the magnitude of the magnitude of the magnitude of the magnitude of the hands and often for hand.
And the people who are not suicidated to be really disappeared by their womans.
NormanMailer, before we die, in the last interview said, "Ogns my book killed a little more. It's a little more remarkable delivered reward."
But we don't bat the way we feel that because we heard these things so long as we heard these things that we have completely interior a result and accepted the notion that creativity and the art, and the end, it will always let the art, it will always let to the wine.
And the question I want to ask all of this is -- you agree with this idea?
It goes you have this thing -- because it looks at it from a centimeter of me displayed that it doesn't have this supposed supposed to myself this supposed supposed to do this suppose.
I think it's hodious.
And I think it's also dangerous, and I don't want to see it in the next century.
I think it's better to encourage our great creative minds to live.
And I sure I know that in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to begin to that feel obviously supposed to be dangered by the circumstances where I'm in my career.
Of course, it's a little look at it, I'm pretty young people -- I have about 40 years.
I still have about four work in me.
And it's very likely anything that I write about what I'm going to be right from the world as the work that used by the world as the work that used after the work that was happening after my last book.
I'm going to be slaved, because we're all about the more friends here -- it's probably probably the biggest of my greatest success is to my shoulders.
Oh, Gesus, which is think!
You know this is the kind of the kind of thought, which brings a person to start drinking nine and I don't want to do it.
I would continue to do this work that I love to do this work that I love with it.
So, the question becomes like, what?
And so I seems to me after a lot of reflections, which the way of working to continue to the design is to create a protective psychological costructive, okay?
I have to find a distance of security between me, I'm writing between me, and I'm writing -- and my natural anxiety that written is going to be able to get out of the time in how to do it begin to look through the time in looking through the time in seeing and seeing other societies to see if they could have the best ideas and healthy and healthy healthy and healthy to find other societies and healthy
how to help people creative people to help people to manage emotional inerents of creativity.
And that research has taken to the ancient Greea and ancient Roma.
You skets because I turn it back, and then comes back.
In the ancient Grecia and anical ancient Rome -- people didn't seem to believe that creativity from men, OK?
It was thinking that creativity was this spirit is the wind and that selled a few survey and unknown for some surdistant distant distant distant and unknown as well.
The grees called these spirits called these spirits of creativity "demon."
Socry, wonderful, he believed to have a demion that elacting wisdom.
Romans were the same idea, but they called the spirit of spirit without a genius.
Which is great because Romans didn't think that a very smart genius was somebody in a genius.
They believed that a genius was this kind of divine that you believed in the walls of an artist, a little bit like Dobby, and who came out of the art of the art and modeling the argument of that work.
Excecequal -- that's the distance of which I think -- that struck struck struck so that it is protected you from the results of your work.
And they all knew that was so that he worked, right?
So the anti-type artists were protected by certain things, like the too narcissm, right?
If your work was exceptional work was not to take it all the market, everybody knows that I had been helped by this encourage that I was helped by this encourage encourage that you could not take the market, and you could not take the market, and you could not get to take all the market, and you could not get the remarkable of the market, they all knew that I encourage to the market, you could not get to get the market,
If your work work, it was not all cold, it was not all cold, right?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be a inable to be a inable thing.
And so people have an conceived the creativity in Occident for a long time.
And then Rinascise came and all changed in this great idea; we put this great idea; we put the human being to the mister of the universe and no longer and no longer space to write the creatures writing detailed by divinity.
This was the principle of the rational humanitu, and people began to think that creativity from the creativity from the ispace ilific ispace and people began to think that creativity from the indeed.
And for the first time in history, you began to this or that artist as a pretty genius, as a pretty much that person with genius.
And I have to tell you, I think it was a big error.
I think it allowing someone, a simple person to believe being like a recipe as the source, and the smistakes, and the sisters of all divines, creative and inthissue is a filming too much of the human fragile to be a film to be a film or a great fragile of human being.
It's like to ask someone of the sun the sun of the sun.
Deffort and distores the ego and creates all these extinct ingestilive on the performance.
And I think it was this pressure to have destroy in the pasts in the past.
And if this is true, and I think that is, and I think that the question becomes and now?
Can we do it different?
Maybe back to a more ancient understanding of the more human relationship between human and mystery.
Or maybe no.
Maybe we can't crash 500 years of ractional thought, in a 18 minutes.
And there is probably people in the audience that would be legitties on the notion that they follow the notion of the notion that they follow people who follow happening to their projects.
I'm going to be not convinced you all about this thing.
But the question I would like to ask is -- why not?
Why don't you think it in this way?
Because it has more sense of any other thing that has ever heard to explain the exasperting the exasperting process of the creative process.
A process that as anyone who has ever tried to do something -- so basically, you don't understand that is -- you don't understand that you don't understand that is a rational behavior.
And in fact, it can sometimes completely paranormal paranormal paranormal paranormal paranorm.
I did this meet recently with the extraordinary poet, Ruth Stone, which has now 90 years, but it was a poet, and he told me that during his childhood, and he told me in the rural Virginia, he was working out in the rural Virginia, and I was going to get it from the country's landscape.
He said it was like a reragorous tracks.
And he came rolling to her rolling to her landscape.
It was going to get there, because he had to get the land under his feed.
He knew to have one thing to do to that point and he was like, "running like a morning -- and he said, "How to do it as a morn."
And so it was going to the home and was following this poetry, and shouldn't have to do something that take a piece of paper and and a pretty fast-house and and dealing it on the page.
And then you couldn't get enough quickly, so he wouldn't get and running and running and she'd be able to get in home and poetrry and she'd continued to rotate through the landscape, and he would continue to rotate through the landscape, and he said, "another poet."
And then there were those times -- this piece of the time -- there were no moments where the time was almost losing and losing it almost losing --
So he was running to the home and was looking for the card and poetry the past and slide and down, and then he said, he was going to go through the while he was moving away and the timeant with the other hand.
He was the poetry from the coad and reputting the body and turned it on the page.
And in these cases, the poetry would be presented on perfect page, but at the last word and intact to the first thing to the first one of the word to the first one.
So when I feel it -- it's crazy equal to my creative process to my creative process to my creative process.
I don't do that my creative process -- I'm not a convict!
I'm a muly, and my work to work is to wake up with the same hororary every day and soul and work and work and work and go up and go up and go up and go up and go over and get coolly on the soul.
But even in my head, I sliped up against that thing, I took that thing, sometimes.
And I imagine many of you can also have a lot of you have the fact that many of you can also be a lot of you can also be a fact.
You know, if the work and ideas and ideas and I got to come up with a certain source.
And what is this one?
And how can we relate to that in the way it doesn't make our head, buttly sanisheds, which makes us health?
So I think about it, the best example I think I have is the Tom I have is Tom Musist, which I interviewed different years ago for a day-ago for a day.
We were talking about this, and you know, Tom, Tom, for the major part of life was the incarnation of the contemporary of the tong, and trying to control these kind of creative impulse-in-type interior.
But then he was hoot, and a day while he was driving on a highway to the highway to Los Angeles, changed all for him.
He was going to quickly and a sent track of this little fragmentment, which comes into his head as a inspiration, and elusive and allected, and the wanting to the wish and you know, it's wonderful, but it doesn't know how to take it.
It has no piece of paper, it has no mathematics, it doesn't have a recorator.
So it starts to feel this old old old old old old growing in him, "I'm going to lose and hushing this song of song.
I'm not quite good enough and I can't do it."
And instead of going to the panic sam.
He had a whole process and made something completely new.
He just looked at the sky and he said, "Scuse, don't you see I'm driving I don't see that I'm driving I do it?"
"You seem to write a song now?
If you really want to exist, you know, you go back to a more opportunity when I can take care of you.
Other advanced to someone else today.
You go to disturbing Leonard Cohen."
And his working process changed after this.
Not work, the work was still dark as a seed.
But the process of the fishing years, the fishing that was released when the genius, the genius, the genius, which was that problems and remaking it out of the problems and remaking it was going to come from, and realizing that it had to be an interior.
but well, this is a piece of piece of a conversation between Tom and a conversation of Tom and this strange and external thing that was not Tom.
So I felt that story began to change a little bit of a way I worked and save me a volted.
This idea, saved me when I was writing "Mangia, Prega, Ama," and fall of those dispertion in one of those dispersing disperation where we all work on something and you can't and start thinking that will be a disaster, that that will be the worst of the worst never write written to be the worst write written write --
Not only good written only write written --
And I started to think about designing this project.
But then reminds me of Tom who talked to the air and triaway.
So I got my face on my face on the written and I would have my comments to a such angle.
And I said to you, "Yes, both both my book is not going to be brilliant not going to be brilliant not going to be brilliant, right?
Because you see I am going to put all of what I haven't no longer than that.
So if you want it to be better and you have to present, you have to get you and make your parts.
Okay. But if you don't know what I don't know about it.
I'm going to write the same because it's my works.
And I would like to do that I have recorded that I today today I presented to me to do my part, because -- the end is that I have in the deserts of the Africa of people were dancing for dances to the dancing and sacred and sacred sacred and sacred music and sacred hours and until hours and the hours to the albe.
And they were magnific because ballers, ballers, and they were fantastic and they were fantastic and they were fantastic.
But every once of that, really, something happened to a little bit of these artists became to actually transendent into reality.
And I know what you know about what I know about it, because I know that you have all seen the way to a certain point, a performance like this.
It was like time you stopping and walering walking through a kind of landing and walking through a kind of landing and not just doing something different than the soliters, but it all was allineaving.
And suddenly it doesn't appears just like a human human one.
But you access to the deeat and under illuminated in the divinity.
And when this happened to the time, the people who knew what was, they knew what was, they were called his name.
They had the hands and started to singing, "Ah, Allah.Allah.Allah, God, God."
That's God, you know.
And I had a name historical historics the south of Spain, they took this habits with their and pronounced it and pronounced in centuries, which is still going to be in Other, which you can see in the hold, which you can see in the correction.
In Spana, when an artist made something impossible and magic -- "Oh, oh, oh, oh, bad, bad, bad, you know, had, you know, a flip -- a foot floor -- a God.
And it's great because we needed to do.
But, the problem goes the day down, when you wake up and discovered that are the 11-a.m. And the last morning of Martedday and last last couple of God is not more.
It's just a deathal with graphs to the knee, and maybe can't never be able to get to the such that he'd never be able to get that head.
And perhaps no one cancer the name of God while it's still to do with the rest of his life?
It's difficult.
This is one of the most pain reconciliations from making creative life.
But maybe it doesn't have to be so anguishing if you can not believe it doesn't believe it -- in your extraordinary extraordinary to you are from you from you to yourself.
But believe it is just that they are given you from a inimaginable sources of this squisite part of your life that you have to go to somebody else when you find.
And, you know, if we think in this whole way of change.
And so I started thinking about it, and it's surely like I thought for different months in the book working on the book that I'm going to ask it for a book that I'm going to follow my big, attention of my big big success.
And what I have to continue to tell me when I feel electric I feel like this is, not afraid to be afraid to be afraid to go to the slip of this is, I don't have fear that I have to continue to go to my own own own now.
Don't score. It's just your work.
It feel like you to presenting you to your parts, whatever you can be.
If your work is ball, it's ball, dance.
If the divine goes on to you assumption to leave some kind of wonderful to leave some kind of wonderful for a moment through your effort to your effort to be a few kind of a beautiful time to get some kind of a beautiful time to get some kind of wonderful things, and you know, if you have a wonderful time through your own being, and you know, "Ole!
Other triments, you do the same tube the dance.
And "Ole!" to yourself.
I think and I think it out, I think it out, I think it out.
"Ole!" to yourself, even for yourself to have human and test text ttest talks to you continuously keep with you continuously.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
As I know I already talked about some of these projects on human genome, what can meaning and the discovered new set of genes.
Now we're starting a new new fashion: we started to digitalize biology and now now started to digitalize biology and now we're getting into a new fase of biology, designing and synthesizing and synthesizing and synthesizing and synthesizing and synthesizing and now to digitalize biology and now
We always tried to ask questions.
"What is life is something that many biological biological to have had to understand various levels.
We tried different approach, reducing it to the minimum minimes.
We're digitalizing by almost 20 years ago.
When we sequenced the human genome is to go from the analogical world of biology in the digital world of the computer.
Now we ask us to regenerate life, or create new life from this digital universe from this universe in digital universe from this universe --
This is the map of a little organism, the Mycoplasma genitalium, which is the smallest species from the tiny genome of those who can replicate in the lab of the lab.
And we tried to reduce the genome to create a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of
We are able to eliminate a hundred genes of about 500 genes of the around 500 who are here.
But when we look at his metabolic map of metabolic map of respect to the now.
See my mind: This is simple for me
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminat, one to the time, is very unlikely that this can bring to a living cell.
So we decided that the only way to progress was synthesize this chromosome, so that we could modificate these components to bring some of these fundamental questions.
And so we started the wind of "Can we synthesize a chromother?"
Can chemistry to produce these great molecules that we have never been able to create the first hours that we have never been able to create before?
And in fact, we can make a chromos?
A chromosome, is just a piece of chemical material inert.
The speed with which we are able to digitalize life is growing up to exponential running to exponential running of the exponential we are able to digitalize the life is growing up to the exponential to grow exponential to grow exponential to grow exponential lives.
Our ability to write the genetic code, progress dep, but it's better than the recording to it.
And our more results the results the brand on a exponential curve.
We started over 15 years ago.
The process has required a lot of passages, beging with a bioetic review before we begin to be experiments.
But we discovered that synthesizing DNA is very difficult to be very difficult to be very difficult to be very difficult to be very difficult to be tough.
There are decades of thousands of cars in the world that are producing small seats of DNA, the longer of 30 to 50 to 50 to 50 feet longer and it's a degenerative degenerative land.
So we had to develop a new methodd to assemble these fragments and correct the mistake these fragments and rors to assemble these fragments and corrected.
And this was our first attempt, to start by digital information of Phi X 174.
It's a little virus that bacterial batteries.
We designed the fragments, effect of the errors and got a molecule of DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters.
The interesting part is when we got this piece of inert material inert and we put it into the bacteria and we put it into the bacteria and produce this genetic code particles and produce these viral particles in viral particles in viral particles and viral particles in viral material particles in viral material particles and we put it into the bacteria and we put it into read this
The virals are then released by cells, they went back to cells, and they have destroying the Elects.
I spoke it for recently recently reaching oil industry telling them that they certainly understanding this model.
They have more than you.
We believe that this is a situation where software can really build his own hardware in a biological system in a biological system
But we wanted to do things more in big.
We wanted to build the batterian chromosome.
It's more than 580 thousands of genetic code of genetic code.
So we thought of building it in the scale of viruses, so that we could change the cassets to change the cassets to understand what the components are a living cell.
The project is crucial and if we start with digital information in a computer, these have to be very accurate to be very accurate to be very accurate to the digital information in a computer, these are very accurate digital information in a computer, these are very accurate digital information in a computer, these are to be very accurate di
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 the accuratezing standards of a mibasic error,
We discovered, resequencing it, 30 errors. If we used that original sequencence.
A part of the process is to design segments that are going to be remarkable to recognize with all the other seats of 50 letters of a little bit of a little working best underunder tiny working together.
We try elements to the universe here.
You probably read that we read the clue of the big.
Think it like this, we have a genetic code genetic code on four letter: A, C, GT.
Three of those letters put together about 20 loads, and there's a specific order of letting for every load.
So we can use the genetic code to write words, thought, siers.
What we did in the beginning was automous automobile
Some have been delused by the fact that it was not poet.
We designed these segments for powering them to just just uniquely unique.
There are people's gapes that repair them and put them together.
And we started assembling the parts, starting with segments from five to seven miles an literally segments of 24 miles an letter to 24 letter to them until to come to 72 miles an letter.
So we have these segments in abundancing these segments in abundancing that we're trying to create a extremely robuster -- as you see in a minute.
We're trying to automatize the process.
So this looks like the tabellon a basket.
When we come to these segments, more than 100 thousand basis, more than 100 miles aren't going to grow it to be directly directly in Ecoles.
You get to the instruments of the modern biology.
So we considered other mechanisms.
We knew about another mechanism, called omology recombination of omology that in biology to repair the DNA degrees to repair seats.
Here's a example.
This organism, called Deinococcus radiation can absorb three million rad rad rad of rad rad of radication.
You can see in the high school, as his chromosome.
In 12 -- 24 hours is reassembled exactly as it was before.
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do this.
These organisms can be several to the completely sily.
They can live under empty.
I'm absolutely sure that life exists in space, and you move to find new environments of water.
In fact, NASA showed that this happened to this happen.
This is a molecule, the image that we built using these process, just using these process, just using the boardling appropriate to inserious appropriate from inset to inserious seat.
The lievised automatically.
This is not been taken with a electronic microscopic microscope microscope microscope microscope with a regular microscope microscope microscope with a region to region to read electronic microscope microscope with a regular microscope m
It's a molecule that we can see it with a microscope with a read microscope of it.
These are pictures that covered a period of about six seconds.
This is the publishing that we did a little time ago.
It's more than 580,000 genetic code of genetic code of genetic code.
It's the biggest molecule that we have ever created by man.
It has a fishing molecular on 300 million.
If we were passive with a 10 and if we were a 10 pages, it would take to a 142 pages to get this genetic code this genetic code of genetic code of a type -- if we passit it with a type of 10 pages, you would take it to get this genetic code of a types of the suspect with this genetic code.
Now, how do we do it work? How can we activate it?
Of course, you can track a virus is a girls.
It's a little more complicated when you use bacteria.
It's also simpler when it's about eucario-cells as our reals, as our reals, you can simply the nucleus and put it on the other one that is basically the process of clonation.
In the bacterium chromosome, is integrated in the cells, but we recently showed that we are able to do a complex transplant that we are able to do a complete cell of a cell and active it from one other and active it.
We purifted a chromosome, a microbial species.
The two are different than the touch of touch as well.
We added a few genes in a more way that they could decide what choosing to this chromoso.
And it slightly slide with the gapes so that they can kill all the proteins.
And when we put it in the cellular was wondering -- and you appreciate our charge of the new chromosome, the new chromosomed in the cell.
And we started thinking we wouldn't go beyond that, but we tried to go over there.
This is one of the most evolutionary mechanisms of evolution.
We discovered that a second or a second or a second or a third chromosomes from some glap, in a second thousands of new tracks to that species.
So who think about evolution as only a gene that is a lot of the modific has no way much biology.
There are people called "restrial restriction in restrictions is that they have DNA.
The chromosome, that was in the cell that it was not going to have to one.
Cell phona-remosomes that we put it up-hath.
You have the other hand, and recognized the other chromosome, and we found it only with the cell and we found with only the cell and the new chromose.
It's became blue because of the genes that we put in.
And in a short of time, all the characteristics of a species are gone up and transformed the whole new species, and it turned out to the new software that we put in the cell.
All the proteins have changed, the membranes are changed, and when we read the genetic code genetic code of what we turned to you down.
Now, this may seem genetic altery software to the DNA software to change things in enough suffering things that are sustaining things that are sustaining things in enough.
Now, I explained that you don't talk about genesis -- but of progress from three million years of evolution, and I told that we're going to create a new version of the Cambrifision of Cambrian explosion that will create new species on this digital process that you can create new species on this digital process.
Why do that?
I think it's quite obvious when we think about our needs as we think about our needs.
We're going to go from six billion and a half of people at nine in the next 40 years.
I was born to give a example: I was born in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for each of the planet for each of 1940 years, there will be four-year-old people will be four.
We're going to have a problem that are food, fresh, fresh, cocket, medicinal and gases for six billion people.
It's going to be hardest for nine billion.
We can lize more than five billion carbon dioximately than 30 billion bars.
He means millions of barrels to millions of barrels to the day.
When we try to find biological processes or any kind of process to replace them, it's going to be a huge challenge and to be a huge challenge for a lot of process.
In the more we have to keep the CO2 emission of these materials that end up in the atmosphere.
At day day of today, thank you to scientific discoveries in the world, we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I like to think that are designed for the future.
The electronic industry has only been a dozen of components, and think about how many different things came out.
Our limits here are data principlely by biological reality and our imagination.
Now we have techniques, thods these methods of synthesization, in grab grab of what we call combinatories.
We are able to build a big robots that can produce a million chromosomes a million chromosomes a day.
Think of the processing these 20 million different genes or to try to get to optimize the processing to produce eights or drugs, we can change a little team, and more biology theater and create biology that in the last 20 years of science.
And it's just a standard.
We can choosing choosing chemistry or chemistry or carbon vaccines or carbon vaccines of vaccines --
This is a few software programmed with some software programmed to seat, and design species and design species and design species in the computer.
Well, we don't know necessarily as they will be no.
We know exactly what their genetic code.
Now we're focusing on four-generation.
You can see that you can go out of the eanol from grand was a matter experiment.
We have a second floors of second and third generation that will come up pretty soon sugar carber than the tanoler as well.
But the only way that biology can have a great impact without increasing more food and limiting the food of food and limiting the disease would be transforming CO2 in material that we're working to design cells that we work to design this discovery, and we think we could achieve this discovery, and we think we could achieve that we have a little deal with the food-generation in about 18 months.
The solar light with CO2 is a methodom -- but in our discoveries in all over the world, we found different methods.
This is a organism, we described in 1996.
It lives in the ocean deep about 2500 feet deeply to the water temperature of water.
It creates put from CO2 using molecular energy as source as a source of energy.
We're trying to figure out if we can put the CO2, which can easily be transported to be transported to the CO2 in carbon that CO2 in carbon to drive this process.
So short we think we could be able to increase what the basic questions of the question of the basic is Now, truevidence is Nod, true. We have the goal of oil industry.
Rightly. If you can't do it from TED, where can you do it from TED, where can you do that?
It would become a bad source of energy.
And also, we're working for using the same way to use the same way to create vaccinistant vaccine.
You saw this year with infection, we are always background of a year and a dollar in less when it's treat the right vaccine of the right floor.
I think that this is going to change build combinable in advanced vaccine in ancient ant.
That's how the future could start to change it, it looks like changing, now, the tree of evolution, acceling evolution, accelerating with synthetic bacteria and then infinally cell cells.
We're so much as much as the best people.
Our purpose is to do enough to try to do it to do it. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
Before I will show you that the most possible to see the most possible, a fundamental job, in the new technology that we took Microsoft in the following of a year ago, it's Seadragon. This is Seadragon.
It's about a environment where you can interact is a local level that remote with a huge amount of visual data from visual data
So we're seeing a lot of gabyte photographs of digital footo-constant, and continuous for a quickly slips, which is like, you know, the images as we want it.
And it doesn't matter how big information of information that we see -- how big these data raw these data data or images.
Most of them are digital photographs, but this for example, it's a provision of the Congresss' Congresss and come into the gam, and reentering in the gamma of 300 megam.
It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that the prestations of a system like this is the number of place on your screen on your screen on the screen. It's also a very flexible architecture very flexible architecture of a very flexible architecture of a system like this is the number of place because the only one of
This is a book book, for the data of data not images.
This is the Casa desolaty of Dickens. Every cool represents a capitol.
So to show you that it's just about text and not images, we can do a thing about the representation of the representation of a representation of the representation of the text representation of the text representation of the textbook, not a picture.
It could be a little artificial way to read a book of electronic book.
You don't look at it.
This is a more realistic. It's about a number of The Guardian.
Every image is the beginning of a section.
And it gives you really like the pleasure and beautiful experience of a review or a quote, or a quote, which is a lot of mezing of mezing like a lot of mezing like a lot of mezing like a lot of mezing like this.
We also did something with the Guardian angle of the Guardian.
We created a high-resolution to higher resolution -- much higher than what you use in a normal advertising in a normal publish.
If you want to see the characteristics of this cartoons, you can see here.
Or other models, or even technical specific models, or even the other specific specific models, or even the technical patterns, or even even thousands.
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the space limits on the screen.
We hope that means that mean to put pop-up and other portive to other similes, not to be necessary.
Of course, the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology.
And I don't want to lose time if we don't say that we have contributes to be giving this field.
These are all the roads in the U.S.
So now we go to something else.
This is actually from living on the web -- you can go to the web it see.
It's a project called Photosynth, which combine two different technologies.
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual research computer in Noah Snavely, a student of Washington, with the aid of Washington, with the Seitz of Washington, with Microsoft Rickski Ricki Reschurch. Sottic research of Washington, but collaboration.
And it's from the vive on the web, I run by Seadragon Seadragon.
You can see it when we do this kind of screen -- you can go from one image to the other and have this kind of experience to multiply resolution to multiple.
But the space collocaation of the images here has actually a meaning.
The visualization of visualization in the computer registered these images together, so that the real imagine, which the real imagining -- all the neighborhoos on the Grashes on MontagRoccies on the MontagRoccies -- have been taken canay and these things are all in space. And these things are all in space.
I don't know if I have time to show you some other environment.
There are a lot more space than that.
I want to go directly to one of the original data set of Noah-- and this comes from a previous Photosynthosynth that we did working for the first time -- to show you what I think is really clearly the key is truly the key to the technology -- Photosynth. And it's not necessarily as evidence that we put in the website, technology that we have put in the website,
We had to worry about legal aspects and so on.
This is a reconstruction of Notre Dame is Flickr. Basta digitating Notre digitating Notre Dame in Flickr. and you get images of these types in the major and so on the fields, and so on the one of these arancestors and view a picture that you have been discovered to this model.
So I'm all images that are made from Flickr and have been all colleged to this space in this way.
And it's possible to navigate in this simple way of this simple way.
You know, I would never have thought of finishing to work for Microsofts.
It's very free to get this kind of acre-awarding.
I think you can see that it's a lot of different kinds of fun fun of different photos of these phones in the professional types of SLR, a significant number of meaning in this environment.
And if I can try to see those strange strange to look at the strange.
Many are blocked, etc., etc.
And somewhere here is a series of photographs -- etch it -- etch it is.
This is a Notre poster of Notre Dame registlly.
We can go from the poster physics of this enview of this environment.
The essential point is that we can do things with the social environment. This is now taking from everything from the entire memory of view of view -- and it gets out of view and college all those data together.
All those pictures become colleged together, more of the parts.
You've got a modeland that is emerge.
Think of this as the motion of Stephen Lawler work,
It's something that is growing in complexity as people using that people useful us. And the advantages for the people who use it with use.
Their pictures are marched with other people.
If someone is the idea of contrast all these sands telling the name of the catter of Notre Damamimprovement Damimprovisily required to use of all those data, and I can use it as a ningressed and using the space, using the inner of the space, using the how, using the social experience of recross-smok-res-re-shot experience experience of the s-like skets and red---re--red experience and the idea of the idea of s-uspendying experience of spots and rewaling source.
Of course, a consequence of all this is extremely elaborated virtual models of all interesting in the planet, don't just from viewed and set satellitaries, but the memory of the collective virtual and similar and similar and similar and similar and similar and set satellow virtual synthetic models and similes, and similar and set and similar and and and similar and and and and and similar models, and and and and and and and and similar to the similar ftympatterns and and and
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I understood weight? What your software will have to do is that at some point, in the next years, all the photographs shared in the whole world will be practically college in the world will be practically college together?
BA: Yeah. That's what is doing is going to discover.
He's creating hyperlins, if you want to hyper, you know, you know, in images.
And it's doing it in the base content of the images.
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the wealthy of information that many of these images can set images.
And as you do a research of images on the web -- you degate a sentence and the web has a lot of information about the pictures of the pictures of the pictures of the pictures of the pictures of images on the web has a lot of images on the web page, and you have a lot of images on the web is a lot of the pictures of images on the web is about the web on the web and the web on the web pagage web on the web and the web page,
Now, what happens if that picture is a picture of your picture?
So the amount of interconnection, and the amount of realm that is really enormous about is really enormous -- it's a classical effect of the net.
CA: Blaise, it's really incredible. Compliments.
BA: Thank you very much.
One of the main of the main of the research of research of research is the power to live between who has no anti-traditions, between people who have no anti-tradition-living real-like real-living plants.
You think that Jaguar sciamanancient still beyond the Vily Milky Way, or that the people of the ancient Inuit is still covered significantly meant to remind the respire maining the respire maining the respire maining the central importance of the anthropologies, and the idea that we are not a sense of reality, but it's just a reality, but it's just a model of reality,
the consequence of a particular choices of adapt choices that our stirps has made --
And of course, we all share the essential tracks.
We all born it. Everybody is born it.
We're subjected to the initiation of the initiation.
We have to deal with the inexorability of death, so there don't surprising us and ballim --
all of us have a art.
What it is the tops is the particular song, the rhythm of every culture.
It doesn't matter that they are the Forests of the Borneo, or the Voodoo doo matter of Haiti, or the Kaisut in Kenya sectentriors of Kenya sect-sam, or a meller in the Sahara.
He was my journey companies in desert a month ago, or a month ago, or an yak in valley valley in the valley various valley in the world.
All these people teaching people that are taught us that there are other ways of thinking, other ways of thinking, other ways of thinking, other ways of thinking, other ways of moving around the world.
And if you reflect a minute, it's a concept that can give you hope.
So we can see, my cultures of cultures of the world create a spiritual life and cultural and cultural cultural that has been the planet and cultural for the planet so as a ragnacity like biosphers.
And you can think of this cultural ragnacy as a ethnos: and you can define the ethnose. And you can define the sum of all concepts of the conceptied, inspirations, intuitions that intuitions from being human allowed to the human imagination from the consciousness of the consciousness.
The ethnose is the amazing real-remon-a-a-like remoney.
It's the symbol of what we are and what we can be in as a species of what we can be in as a species.
And because the biosphere was free of gravely consumed as it happened to the eetnose and purposely more quickly.
No biology, for example, it would say that 50 percent of all species was about the orle of the simply because it's false fouse -- in the most of the halse of biological diversity -- in the most biological diversity -- that you don't even close to the most optimistic diversity.
The indedex, of course, the language.
When you were born there were 6,000 languages on this planet.
One language is not just by a vocabulary or from a series of rules.
One language is the shoulder.
It's the means that the animation of every culture is in the material in the material in the material in the material.
Every language is a forest of the mind, a thinking, a thinking, a thought, a thought, a very ecosystem of spiritual possibilities.
And of those 6,000 languages, while we are sitting here at Monterey, at least half the half is not ssurring in the ears of children.
They don't get more teached to the kids, which means that you don't change something that means something that are died.
What is more of being volved than being flight by silence, to be the last tongue of being the language of being a tonguage of the kids?
This is a folded state of someone in the world every two weeks of the world every two weeks a folds die and brings with a sillabes of a anguguy.
And I know someone of you will tell "Is it not better like that?
The world would not be a better place, if we all slight? The same language?" Benissynism -- then we talk a single yorba.
We talk to kogis.
You will be able to be a tract of what it means can't talk about their language.
I would like to do you have a journey through ethnos:
a little journey in ethnose to the absolutely to what we're losing is going to lot.
Many of us forget that when I say "different different different ways of existers" inting really different ways of existers.
We take for example, this Barasan Amazon in Scitony Sckony people who believe the absolute of the anaconda, which creates of the west in the milk of the best skets in the milk of the skets of the skets of the best sacres.
It's a people who are not able to distinguishing the blue color, because the celests is identified in the forest, which is identified in the forest, which is identified the people who dependent dependent on the forest, which is identify of the popular color.
They have a strange language and a mathemrimonial rule called "English exogamy language.
All of this has radicated in the past, all of the particularity is that in these families are talking about six or seven languages because of the mystock mysters because of the mystic marriages.
They listen to listen to and then start talking about.
We take one of the most interesting tribes I lived with which I lived -- the Waorananananans of Ecuador who had the first contact in 1958.
In 1957 five misionary missionaried a committed mission of a commercial error.
They made up from the photographs that were going to be very few of the photographs that had been able to loving that this people who were going to be loved by the plug of the forest had never seen nothing about bi-dimensional forest.
They skets the Earth, they turned to research of a form or a figure and they have killed that it was the diavol, and they kill five missions that five missionaries with the five missionaries with the lances.
But the Waorans didn't kill the stract foreigers.
They kill it in a game.
Five percent of mortality was caused by their own stys.
We have risalitites and we found two natural death cases and when we insisted for knowledge and when we put it for knows that one of them was aging that they died it down, and then they killed it killed it to the same. At every time, they had a knowledge of the forest.
The hunters were able to recognize the animal from 40 steps and recognize the species.
In the first '80s, I was assigned a very interesting tassigned when my professor Harvard was asking me if I wanted to go to Haiti to intrupholaring societies in the power of Duval and Tonton Macoutes, and I impossessed to the valier and Tonton Macoutes, and I impossessed to do the veling area.
To give a sense to the miracle Vodouble, I should have been understanding culture.
It's a kind of a complex metaphaling of the world.
Very interesting.
If I ask you to tell you the great religions of the world, what would you say?
Cristianism, Budddhism, Budddhism, etc.
A continent is always left out, thinking that sub-Saharan Africa, it doesn't have features. And instead of these religious concepts of these religious concepts very deeply deeper very deeply of the slave that the trageed deeply of the slavery of the slavery.
What makes you interesting your voodoo is the intense of life and death.
So the live live to the spirits.
You know, the spirits can be invoccurred by the Great the dance of the dance and replacing temporary replace in the dance animation that for a short that for a short moment.
So your voodoodoodoodoodooists to talk about God.
We drink in the temple and we become God."
And the moment you are going to be a hold, is the spirit that you drive, how can you do it a bad?
So you see these incredible events of these incredible events of trance events that touch of trance that touch infure recoming a pretty strong the body when it was catalyzed in the body when it was catalyzed in a state of exciting excited about the right when it was catalyzed in a state of excited trance.
And all the people that I lived in the most extraordinary Kogs are the Kogi Sierra from Santa Marta, in the Santa Marta, in the Colombia.
Forming ancient cicivilization that when you live on planet that when they were living on the floor, the people who were going to be on the vulcanic planur.
In a ballock continent blood that this people have never been conquered by the spagnow.
But all of the way I have government by a class but their formation is decidely.
The young people are taken on the family and three or four years and secret living in a world fact of good and shadow in a world fact of the glaciers for 18 years.
Two nine years of choices to reproduce the nine months of the gestation of gestation that turned into the mother, now I'm metaphorically in the user of the Great Mad.
So that time, they come acculate to the values of their society, values that predict and their predictions and only their preachers and only their praier balance, they would say the equilibrio to say the equilibrium.
And in terms of this incredible initiation, they are suddenly taken out and for the first time in life, at the age of 18 years, see a alb. And in that active awareness of the first cool, when the sun sun the valley, all that they learned in theory is going to have been conferred with the beautiful countering and say:
"Do you see what I said I said, "How I have said,
It's stuff out. It's just going to protect it."
They call the brothers and say that we we, brothers are the covering brothers of the destruction of the world.
This level of intuition is extremely important.
When we think about the indigenous people and the environment we put Redseau and the old story of the wild history of the noble story of the noble or maybe Thoreffort Thoref, and we say these people are closer to the Earth of the Earth of us.
The indigenes are not feeling feelings or undebt of our algies.
There's no space for these things in the Asmall-haludging or wind gelies in the Tibet, but because of the time and they created a mystical walls of the basic concept of the Earth can live and a well-flight intuition.
What does it mean?
And that means that a Ande And, that grows that grows is a spirit spirit Apu that will be a spirit Apu that will be a deeply and will have a very different reported and will have a very different reported related to a bunch of Montana that ground that grows is a badlanding of the Montana mountain to be a bad rocking baby to be a broketed brocks to be a dester destine and and growing that ground to be a descavory of the mountain that are ground blevered out that are ground to be a blevered
Whether it's a spirit of a spirit or a mineral is irrileving.
What is interesting is the metaphor that defines the report between individual and the natural world and natural world.
I grew up in the forests of Columbia growing forests creating that the forests to be cute.
He made me a human being different human being different from my friends Kwaykiut, who believe that the forests are the dimora dimora and the write of the Hukuk and the cannibal well-wing extreme in the northern northern extreme in the world and the cancering that deal with Hamatsa.
If you start to consider these cultures can create different reality, you can start some reality, you can start some sensational. We take this plant. We take this plant.
I took this picture to open in the normal Amazon the normal Amazon the normal Amazon the normal Amazon the normdocts.
Maybe some of you have heard about ayaahuasca, the most powerful stance, the most psychoactive repertor of the sciamanic repertor of the sciamanic repertor of you have heard about ayaax, the most powerful stock of the repertowards of the repertor of you have heard of the repertor of you have heard of the ayaxtacoactive of ayaax, the most of the psychamber.
What makes it fascinating the ayaaxis not the drug potential to the physical powers, but the elaboration. It's compoor. It's compoem two elements.
On the side, this liana ld, that conties a series of beta-carb, harmine and harmwalking, slightly hallucinogen.
Taking the only plant is a blue smoke is a blue smoke that alters a little bit of a coffee with a coffee of the coffee of the coffee of the coffee of the coffee of the coffee Psychotria viria of viridis.
This is a trip of tription, very similar to the seroton-seroton, dimeyptamine-metho-five methox-methoxo-metho-tmeyler:
If you ever see Yanomami to slide on the nose sustaining for a different set of species, which is a different species, anchors of species, which is meant methox-methoy-dimethox.
To be that the police for the nose is a little bit like being spared by a smoky smoky and land land land land land to land land to land on a distortion.
I was often in my professor, Richard Evan Shultes, the man who shot was psychedelic was psychedelic with his discovered covering in the '30s in the '30s in the '30s in Mexexico.
I think my tanks can classified these triptamine trips like hallucinogens because if you're done not going to tell anybody to be hallucinated. They can lose not be absoluted because they can have been such a glapped by a glapping out of course that you find in the summer and you can find out the worloximinct mono-obsize.
It's possible to assummers only if you assums with other chemical chemical required.
Now it's the beauti: the better, the better, which is in this liana is inbitors of MAO, of the same kind of like to potential trial to potential to potentially be able to potentially about 80,000 species of plants, like these people who are doing this popular and find two deadologically not similar, but if you combine in this way, believe that it's sum to the particular version of the particular face?

But if we ask the Indians, they will tell us "The plants will talk to us."
What does it mean?
This tribe, Cof, Cofan, 17 variety of ayaask -- which are born in the forest, and that our eyes would come in the forest, and that our eyes would come in the same species.
If they ask them, how they will you say their tassonoms will tell us "I thought I was not all about plants, I wouldn't you know about plants, I said, "No."
The solution is, you take the 17 variety in a different night and each night and each other.
With this is not deaurea to Harvard, but it's much more interesting than counting the stames.
Now, the problem is that the problem is that the people who have to hack the people who have to get pector of the respect of the margins of respect to our real world in our real world -- and pass it goes to our real world and spent a little bit of a real-to-gathering patches that are also burn to the several world of us that are reduced to the segs of us to the realal peoples of us who have to have the realal peoples of us who have history in the problem of us who have to be the realong people who have to have to be popules of the world peathertor heart people who have to our our real world in our our real world in the real world histor
In fact, the XX X century, in 300 years, it will not be reminded for the wars or innovations, but rather like it was where we stopped and we have abbrushed and we have hopefully or accepted the mass of biological diversity and cultural diversity and cultural diversity and cultural diversity. Now the problem is not change.
All cultures through the centuries have been involved in a dance for new possibilities.
And the problem is not technology.
Indians Sioux not stopped to be Sioux when they put out of a cold and freck and freck and freck and heat the hororse and heat it.
It's not the change or the technology that they threat the integrity of ethnow.
The flight less on the domination.
And if you give you a look at the world, you discover that these are not destiny cultures to disappearing.
They're living creatures and dynamics are outside of the existence that will beyond their own ability to adapt their ability to adapt their adaptation.
Sky that you can see in the patria of the guy of the guy --
Sarawak, in Sarawak, in the south of asian people who lived in the forest fact, and now reduced to a generation and now reduced to the service and prostitution, where you can see the rivers of the rivers that seem to bring the rivers of the book, where you can see the horizontor in the Mar Cinese Mery Cinesthesis in the Eastern Co-inese Merdiont, where they have the orizonty navele,
ready to hill the forest.
Or in the Yanomams, are the diseases that are coming with the discovered discovered with the discovered of the hour.
If we mountains on Tibet, where I'm doing a lot of research, you see the during the face of the political domination of the political domination.
As you know the genocide extinction of a people in universal level, is convicted to universal level, but the ethnocide destruction, not only is convicted to the world of the developing of the developing of the developing of developing in certain the environment.
And you can't understand the suffering of Tibet until you get from the beginning.
I spent 6,000 miles from Chinina in the Western China in the Western China -- and coming to Lhasa with a young college, but only came to a young and I reached to understand what we heard about the statistics that we heard about it.
6,000 world-sacred world-sacred world-sacred money.
1.2 million people killed from military in the Cultural Revolution.
The father's father's been ascritten to Panchen Lama.
Which means that was killed to the Chinese times of invasion.
He's smoke with Sua Santity in Santity in the diaspora that led people who brought the people in Nepal.
Her was unprisoned and his cool cool was to received.
It was brought to hide a coaster of two years of two years old, hid-half years because it could not live without of him.
The smile, who did the sam, it was put in the field of reeducation.
One day he was really calculated a raffuring a raffuring of May May for seven years.
The Tibet of Tibet can be insurvey but the redental spirit of the people is from tener to slide is tenural to present.
And then you get a choice, you reduce a choice.
We want to live in the world of the world of the world or we want to act the policyromatical world of diversity?
The great anthropologists before they die said that his biggest fear of his greatest country, in our world, we will not just see the whole gam's view of human imagination reduced to a modality of human imagination reduced to a delilightly day to wake up with a day we see it from a deeth, but a day we were other possibilities.
And it's huming us that our species is existed for 600,000 years.
The Neolitical Rvolution that has given us agriculture, which has made us such the cult of seeding the seeds of the slide of the scample, creating the gerarchy of the specialization, and we talk about 10,000 years ago.
The modern industrialized world has been 300 years.
And that is a shark story not suggests that we have the answers to all the challenges that we have to face in the millen-year-old guys to come come.
When these myriads of the world is asked what it means to be humans, respond with 10,000 different voices.
And it's in these answers that we all answers to the possibility of being what we are. a conscious species that we all the people and all the people and job is a conscious time that all the people and joy is great moments of optimism.
I took this picture on the northern extremity of Bface in Bfact, when I went to hunter, and this man, and this man, and he told me the wonderful story of his grandfather.
The Canadese was not always the people, with the Inuit and in the '50s to stabilide of our own own own soil, we have reined them in colonies.
The grandfather of this man, he refused to go to it.
The family, temping for his life, he took all the arms, and all his attres.
You have to know that Inuit n't, you know, the cold, they don't have the cold,
The slands in origin were made of fish skin fish pelles.
The grandfather of this man, you don't do intimid-nice artic or the boards, or from the boards.
It's sket, he was hoted the skets in skin the pants and defected defect in their hand. When I did you have congeled, they have worked by creating a lam.
He salived on this slip is on this caccess and when you get it to solid, it killed a dog.
He had a bunch of a bunch of a balloc, with the cassets and he made a sland. And he spread on the banks, and it's disappeared on banks, and it's disappeared on the banks, and it's disappeared in the real-asis.
We want to talk about it with nothing?
In the opennine government canadese government to the Inuit to the Inuit of a territory of a territory of California and Texmust set together.
It's their new peat-new peat-up called Nunavut.
It's a territory of independent resources. They are all resources.
One beautiful example of how a country-state countries with his popular people.
And finally, I think it's pretty obvious at least at least to the people of the planet, realized that they don't have remote.
For someone is home.
They representing sections of human imagination that rises at the high of the daughters. And for us all of these kids, like our kids become part of our kids become part of our kids become part of our children's hope.
For finally, National Geographic is convinced that political are never going to get nothing to do about nothing to do about nothing.
We believe that the polemy --
[Apple] are not persuasive, but we believe that stories can change the world, and maybe we are the best institution, and maybe we are the best institution, our website is 35 million visite.
156 Paese countries have transmitted our television.
Our magazines are literally from millions of people.
Our work is traveling in ethnose to bring our public in places of the cultural amount of cultural amount of living in the way they see, they will be hope to reveal the central anthropologists of anthropologistls in a pluralist world in a pluralist in pluralist, and multical multicultural and multical multural multural multical and multicular multural multicultural world in the age of multural amagage.
in which the wisdom of all the people can contribute to our well-being collective.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some of the things I wrote in this book that I hope I hope to reach other collegments, and I'm going to try to see some other collegments, in case not usually using them notice.
I want to start with what I call "the dog, the official dog.
The office doger dog, what?
The dogma dog, the official societies of all industrial societies, "If we want to massive the well-being of our citizen" well-being of our citizen."
The reason that is from a side, in fact that freedom is in the same a value, is precious, essential for human beings.
On the other is that if we are free, each of us can act for us to do everything that is a connect to do everything that we do our well-being, without any of our well-being, without any of our well-sheet.
The way to massive liberty is to massive choice.
More people choices people -- the more choices is their freedom, and more than they can well.
So this is so deeply radicated in society that no one of the society that you would have to put it in a dubble to him.
And it's also deeply in our lives.
I'm going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible.
This is my supermarket. It's not particularly large.
I allow me a simple named on a saved conditions.
In my supermarket there are 175 conditions, without containing 10 varieties of oil, and 12 balssamic and 12 balsamic acets that you can buy to make you a huge number of conditional conditional number of mines that you can get a huge number of mind-half already already is to your demand.
That's how the supermarket.
And then you go to the electronic stairs to buy a stere: CD, Britain, Blifish, printing CD, radio Blifiers.
And in this single store of electronic components is a great number of components.
We can make six million different combinations of different combinations of different combinations that there are just a store of the components that there are just a store of different combinations that there are just a negotie.
You have to admit that there's a lot of choice.
Other than the camp: the world of communications.
Once, when I was a child, you could get all the service telephone telephone phone that they were supposed to be mammBell.
He read the phone -- you didn't buy it out.
A consequence of that, in the other, was that the telephone don't break rocket.
These times I went to it.
So we have a variety of telephone variety of telephone, especially between cellphones.
Here's the future.
My favorite is the middle of the MP3, cutting the nose, and the form for the cris bulking.
If you don't have seen it in the story of the house standing of the house you can't have seen a revery.
And what happens is that people are going to across the story and does this question and do this question. And you know what the answer? The answer is "No."
It's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn't make too much of things.
So, in other aspects of life that are much more important than waters, you will be the same explosion.
Assistancitari: It doesn't happen in the United States that you go from the doctor and doctor drive you what you have to do.
Instead, you go from doctor, and the doctor says, "Okay, we could do A, or B" and these risks" has these benefits and risks" and these risks."
You say, "Dottor, what should I do?"
And the doctor says, "It has these goods, and Bs have these risks, and Bs have these risk."
"What do you want to do?"
And you rebat the beat if she was to me, what to do?
And the doctor: "But I'm not here."
The result we call it the "autonomy of the malato," expression, that makes it look like a beautiful thing.
But in fact, it's not that a shift and responsibility of the decisions of the decisions that somebody who knows that doctor, you know, doctor, and then not a lot of dised, and so it's not a disease to get the patient.
There's a huge marketing products, whether it's a drugs, direct people like me and you think it doesn't sense, it has no sense, you know, it doesn't sense, it has no sense, that we can't buy them.
But if we can't buy them, because we published them this?
The answer is that they want you domatter to change the reciper to change the recipe to change the recipe.
And what of so fundamental is the east, it's a question of choice, as you see in this vignet. We don't want to force the kids. We don't want to force the right now, they will be able to make the right now. They'll be invent.
And we can reinventing us how many times we again how many times we can get away from it.
That means that every morning is that every morning to the answer -- you have to decide that kind of people want to be.
Rispace to the family and matrimon, a common time perspective, I was a lot of a where, it was that you woulder to do the most pretty possible, and you start to get the most pretty possible.
The only true is choice was with choice was with choice, not the way to do later.
Ogather, it's really to play.
I teach them very smart students and do 20 percent in less of work than a time.
And because they're not less to be brilliant, because they're not less diligent.
but because I'm impensiers, I mean, I would like to ask you, I should get to do it now?"
"I have to think about my longer one? I have to think about before the kids or career?"
They're interrogative interrupts.
And they try to answer these questions, even if this implements don't completely to make a task you, and not get a well vote to my exam.
And they have to do this. They're really important questions about it.
Now, the job: we are lucky, like Carl arl -- because technology allows us to work every minute, every day from every day on the planet, trans that from Hotel Randolph.
Timple, there's a corn, and I'm not going to tell anybody where, where the WiFi works.
I don't say that, because I want to use it.
What does this mean, this incredible liberty liberty that we have to the work? Is that we have to decide, and continually in every moment, if we have to work or not.
We can go to see our boy play hot cell with the cell phone in the other, and the Blackberry in the other, and the knews and nice tebooks, the knee.
And even though I'm all afraid that we see our son boy that we see our son round the game, we're also wondering this call?"
"I have to answer this email? I have to ablead this liter?"
And even when the answer is "us," all this makes the experience of your child is very different than what it would be in other conditions.
So from any part of that we look at the things and large stuff, things and large materials and life, life is a question of choices.
And once the world was this: Okay, there were some possibilities, but it was not a question of choice.
The world today is like this: The dilemma is, "I’m a good thing or negative negative or negative negative or negative negative now.
The answer is the Shool of the answer is the Shold.
The positive sides to them all of the negative and so I'm going to talk about those negative negative to the negative lands.
All this choice two negative effects two negative effects on the people.
The first one, paradoxy is that produce paralysis instead of liberation.
With many options of which choosing options to do it.
I give you an example of mean you know, a study that is a flight plans.
A minute of my college had access to the Vank society founds, the giant societies, with about a million clients of a million clients in 2,000 different companies.
What she found is that for every 10 solutions that are offered for every 10 solutions that are offered and devices of 22 percent.
With 50 sources is 10 percent of offers, and there is a 10-foundly deeply than only 5. Why?
Because with 50 sources that choose, is maledetailing is a very difficult to decide and choice is remained to indemable.
And at the question and questions, questions, questions, and of course, questions, and of course, that is not going to be there.
You know that this doesn't just mean that these workers will be able to the food for cans because they don't have enough money, it means that decision is so hostic that decision is so hostic that they lose the founds of work.
Don't participating, they losing to 5000-dollars per year from work, which would be well disposed to craft.
So the paralysis is a consequence of having too many choices.
And I think that makes the world like this.
"And finally, for ethescharge, or majions: ketchop, or maion?"
You would just take the right decision, if it's for ethernity, right?
You don't want to choose the wrong source, and nep, and you can have the wrong.
So this is the first effect. The second is that if we can avoid the paralysis and make a choice, and we end up the wild of how we would be states with less options that we would have been on the choose.
And this for different reasons.
One of these is that with a lot of people who have choose, if you buy a and it's not perfect, it's easy to imagine that you could have a different choice, which is that you could have been better than it would be better than it would be better than it would be better than being getting a different choice, and the matter and the climbing the sodden decrafting the pressure of the pressure that you could have been going to be better and deeffort by the pressure decision,
even when it was a great decision.
More choices are easy to be dispieable to any detailing of any detailing of choice.
Also, there's what economists are called the cost-opportunity.
Dan Gilbert asked a very well stamning of the value that we dependent things that we confrontive things we confrontive with what we confronties.
In the rest of that, when there are many options to represent the alteristic characteristics of alternative and be less to be less sodden the optiontions of the options that choice.
Here's a slipt for the people who are not New York Cit."
But it's what you probably thinking.
There's this couply to Hamptons.
A place of lush.
It is a beautiful ded. It's all about them. It's all for them.
Not nothing that he thinks is, "Well, maledion is Augost."
"Everybody in Manhattan are alized."
"I could talk about my front in front of home."
And pass two weeks away from the idea that it's losing -- every day -- every day is the possibility of parking where it wants to get to the way it wants to do.
The expen-opportunity diminues the soddisfation for what we have, even when the choice was excellent.
And the more options that we have to consider it, the more characteristics will be returning out to us as a cooopportunity.
Here's another example.
This view is a lot of things.
It talks about the live moment, and maybe living slowly.
But the most important point is that any of the choices of you choices you choices not do others.
The things that we don't choosing a lot of four that can make less atter what we do.
Third point: Do you expectancy expectancy.
I tried on my skin buy a new jeans.
It almost jeans.
Once jeans were just a tapped -- they were bought to the bestia, they were dissimis, only after they brought them a life and worked a lot of times, they were began to go well.
So I went to buy a couple of new when the old people were going, and I said, "I need to take a couple of jeans, this is my cutton."
The committed said, "You want you to slip floit, and asked it, relaxed folks?
Who wants to the cernier or bottons or bottons or "Stonebonts." "Is it a hedge or hedge of the bottons or "Stones?
"Would you like it takes you realize you know?
"Soth you want them to be stretty? Bla black -- I met it to elencare.
I was going to say, "I want to have a little bit of a little bit of a cheans, and I was the only typoth." It was the only typically I tried to all the way I tried to all the jeans, then I went out of the best jeans, and then I was the best jeans I had ever been able to say:
It was the male of the choice had the best I had had the best best.
But I felt I worse to me.
Why? I wrote a book for understand it.
The reason why I was worse for that I was worse with that choice was altish of the mies were altise.
I had existing minimes. I didn't expectations of exceptional when you existed only when you see 100 different than 100 different in the type of 100 different stuff.
What I had water was good -- but not perfect it.
After I was going to have the choick with what I was trying to put in the confront of what I was trying to confront with what I was trying to look like.
The addition of options in life that people don't have to increase excellence.
And this will produce less soddisftion, even when the results are good good people.
None in the world marketing in marketing in marketing the world of it.
Because if you know what I'm talking about, you know, what I'm talking about.
The truth is more like this.
"You was better when he was worsed when he was wors." The reason that you were worse when you were worse is that when you were worst was still possible to meet the surprised surprised of pleasant when you were worse was still possible to meet the surprise.
Ogives a day, in the world that we live -- opulently opulners, industrialized with the perfection -- the massive that we can hope is that things are at the high-way.
You never have to be surprised because your vosting waits, you have involved my waiting expectancy.
The secret of happiness -- whose is here -- "Baspectance."
I mean, little time I mean, little time authobiographic -- which is really unununstuff -- I am really wonderful.
I wouldn't do better, I didn't do better, I didn't have to be able to do it anymore.
But you don't always have a good thing.
And finally, a consequence of buy jeans comfortable jeans comfortable when you have that jeans is that when you have no sodden to be satisfilled and ask you "Why?"
Who is responsible, "What's the answerers?
The world is the responsible is responsible. What could we do about that?
When there are hundreds of jeans, and you buy a little bit of a jeans, and you ask you who is responsible to you who is responsible to you are using that you are you.
You could have been able to do better.
With hundreds of variety of variety of various various various of the insuccess.
So when people take decisions, even if the result is the result is valid, you feel insodly insod-like a colp, and they give the colp to their own hole.
In the last few years the depression is explosively in the industrialized world industrialized
I think a factor -- not the unique, but important -- not the unique, but the important -- of this depression is that people have depression experiences because the standards are too high.
And when they have to explain this situation think that colp.
So the final result is that we are better, objectively but we feel worse us.
Let me reminds you that you remember you.
This is the official dog, what we all take for good and it's completely false. It's not true.
There is no doubt that a little bit of choices better than you don't have a lot of choice is better than a lot of choice is better than a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a while.
There's a critical value, I don't know what it is.
But I'm sure we have overovercome from a piece of the level that choices that choices our life.
Now, from the view of view -- I have almost -- I have almost -- the view of the view is the following point.
What it allows up this choice in industrial society is the material is the material is the material
