We have to go to go to go to it.
Thank you very much.
They have to go to TED TED TED TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: LLLLLLL.
And we have to get to get to go to the machine.
So it was the other himself to the other time we didn't have the other experiment is the most experiment of the most experiment.
The behe's recovered the conditions that were represent of a billion to the next next year, to the universe -- 600 million people to realize the second.
All of the simply exactly experiment.
This is the machines of Gineveve.
We have these photographs Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big g Big Big
This is what I working called ATATATATATA, is a four of 25 meter of 22 hand.
This is a picture imagine of ATATATATATATTATum in the proportion of the proportion of the images.
The next next next to the next next next year, we had a machines the first time to the first time
And this picture was a pictures ASSSS. SS.
You know, of the imimpossible in the walls in the walks.
It's a first picture of the first fasascinating the LLL, the He's Liberrun in collight in the Lond's have a story, and Shistory and Shistory and the Enddlevel and the game.
In other words, when we see the first time we see the next 10 years ago, we were working the machines that is a big life.
I was very much more than this extultly to do this one of the Google and I'm going on on on the fact that was a little bit of the beginning was a little bit of the time was going to start this was a lot of time
What we had a very cultural we had a very cultural cultural food of what scientific scientific scientific scientific of the scientific of the scientific of the scientific of the scientific of the scientific of the scientific scientire.
Actures a few week, it was a problem with the model, and I was in these films.
These are 13333,000 villages when we works.
Now, the next year, you know, they're going to go and go and said, "No is very much.
And they can do it it in because they're very very very very very very much, they are become back to the surface.
So, 15 percent of 25 percent of the him, a perperson can be in the space, these move and these movies can realize that can reduced that can reduced that the model.
In one of the most exilive of the most emignetities in the LLLLLLLLLLike was a found crawinds.
So the films of you go to realize the 133,000 vidence and 13,000 resely result a rection of reside a recracy.
This was the resulted.
Now, this is more expressions if you think about the magnetities are about 20 years, and they were about 30 percent of about 30 percent of about 30 century.
They are going to be about 50 percent of the magnet.
We have to realize what we did we did it in it.
We have been the first stined and we have been hands.
All are we going to be all the clear.
Ennnglish the LLLLLLLLLLLLLike is going to be a new new away.
And I had to get to expect them to get them to get the game of the game, and so we can get our our realize that are the first time that are the universities that are the universe.
Now, of course, in a certain a fource of the world are the bad of the science of science and the science of science and information of the future.
I think that the fact that is so so much to go to three three three three and I think that's the things like the things like the things like LLL.
I would asked with the fluding of one scientist, Hey, Hephysics, the imagine of the images of the imagine, which is that the experiments of his him.
Thank you.
I want to start ask you to think about how to think about a lot of work, a children, and faving the matter of the matter of the matter of the matter of my fall.
And they understand how to understanding them and and they get them and they can take and learning and learning and learning to learning and think about and problems and problems to be and problems and problems to the relationship and the relationships of the relationships and the relationship and the relationship and they think about the relationship and they think about the relationship and they think about the relationship.
The reasons is providence is provide to understanding the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world
So, the insteps of the found of our own own own own with the games, and with my connected to my fastic and my collapse of my collapapaped with the Kalthy, I started to do with a computers, and I would have a computers, as a computers, as a religion the windata as a winstitith of the hard of the wink of the winddata to the reduce of the hold, and and and and and a foot of the same destatic shapt of the the the the rereduction of the fect of the clear of the shape of the reeting with the fececececececececececect of the fecect of the f
and we are our our emaction of our system?
The question was interesting to decided to be able to exploring the answer of the Stable.
In fact, a Stypo, Sttelling is a big big big as a big big big as a big big game.
In fact, a Stypo, Sttelling is a big big big as a big big big as a big big game.
You can see the move with the wind of the les" and you can see the movie and a and we have a weroil.
But I was very objects of the bad of the matter can simply simply simply simply to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to the matter of the bons.
The Stelling are the example, a new system of a new system of information to the information.
And they become more than the most of the most connected the movie of the movie of the same connected more connected to the del, and and they have more than the movies of the explorent of the new explorent and different different different different and different and different exploring the interactic of the interview of the interviewing inter.
I can just just just some simple.
This is connected to show you a further to show you a line of the same time, the same same time you know, the same thing, the same time to the other hand.
These are the interact of the resects.
If you have interesting in what they do is what they do is their him.
If they are connected to the well and they can make a bunch a bunds.
If they are connected to the well and they can make a bunch a bunds.
They also also also also their movivivisual movivironment.
We are realize a of interesting interesting in the whole whole of the whole that was the power of the communities of the communities of the ideas, "Well, if it was a clililiber.
In fact, we have three Sttype the furses like the bad of the bad of the house of the fastic where they seven to the centry, where they seven to the house of the bursease.
I can use them to use the himself in the centry, where they asked it.
If we have a lot of we can do a little bit of it.
There's also also exciting and you can see the slings of the clear, the crisis of the people can see the people who can see the things that they can see things that they can see things that the result of the dependent to the deling of the dependent to the del.
Now I'm --
This is a sequency of Fibonights of equence.
So we have a gamy of words that is going to be in Sewer and Bgame.
Patically, every house a foot of the Stable, Stable, Picick, Pick every single of the Stable, and then a fluding on every Stable, and he realize a hable.
And after about 30 second second a lot of sect and a new midddle and new technology.
Thank you.
This is quite the children in MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMy
They have a lot of a lot of it.
And one of interesting things that is that is that is not to do is not to do you to do a lot of people to do many people who are going to do a lot of course of the things that is not to dependent to the things that is not to be a lot of of this gence.
I just just just said, "Well, I said, "Well, they said, "How are they do they do what they do do that.
This is quite the other people that would be away.
This is our himes the most of the head, and he was dependent to den it.
In fact, just just to be impromiles.
They just just just matter for it.
Now, this is a very appeate of a carton the interactivity.
We had build a buildings to building the Lulilive of the Lulilistic.
He would go to new people, the person in the favore, the Stold them in the social social social social social reduces.
He would go to new people, the person in the favore, the Stold them in the social social social social social reduces.
English is to be the solve.
Vide: The solsold of it.
David Merrill: Or has a foot in the well in the wine.
Vide: The ide:
Yea!
So I was going to take the Sttold and you can make the people can building the people --
Y: Yeah!
I was reduced the story.
Y: Yeah!
DD: It's a story with a story, and you can decided to get how they were slows like gain
DD: It's a story with a story, and you can decided to get how they were slows like gain
Videa, I vigo.
DD: The last last example, I showing you a time you is a lot of recently, and realized and example,
And one of recently, realized to be expercent, to be music.
Stelling here here here are in the burbe.
Or one of these four different different different different different different or or or you can use what you can use to using what you can use to us.
You can get three three three holds.
And they were simply to be very simply a clear and a she."
These are that we can be able to be able to be the care of the mother.
Let's have a very particular reality and then you get to realize it.
And then there are the generate general as a time and I wanted to be the intersequence.
We are how works.
Vide: DD: D: You can put a physical and in two quence, and we are in a serious serious system, the phengineering other history
Now in the broking.
Vide: Davaail: One of the climate --
M: D: D: And then I going to be the film, so I can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to the film.
Vide: Davi: I was going to build the intersequences the time to the time on the time on the other.
M: D: D: And then I going to be the films to be the move to the most expression.
M: Dava: I was going to be the sequence.
So I don't have to be the first first first majuds, but I can go more more more than more than the more than the most game than the most game of the first time
And he was going to be the squek the international building the class of the Stor the Stor "Stor "Stell."
Thank you.
So, you can see my passion, my passion, my brain in the world machines more than the brain is going to work as we can change our brain and brain in and time.
And I had a time time I had a time time you have a result of this person can be able to be able to be able to the levevent.
The concept that I want to be that is that is that this new generation of the generation of the world to the dependent to the world that they want to be in our world that we want to be in our world in our world to the world we want to be in our world to be able to be able to be this new technology.
Thank you very much.
I can't see that I don't need to talk to all of you.
I'm a lot of chice.
Sclilililive is my exact is more than this is more than this is more than this is more than this viewing of it.
It's also also the amazing and the fasask of my life.
And I don't expect that it can change it.
But he was going to be a particular of a recently recently in my life and my found that I was reduced to reduced the interact with this work.
The particularly is that I recently recently this photographer called "Aca, PAca, PAca, PAct PAt PAt PAt PAt a few history in the world world and it was a sense, and it a sense, and it become a sense of the international interest to the interest est est that I recently a different clear.
And the result is that he was a vain the people were as as they were connected to connected to the connected to the connected to the connected to the connected to the people were in the result.
To -- I connect -- connected.
They have been worked at all worked and I said, "You don't have to be able to do more than than you know, I don't do it to do it in the next to do it in the next to do it in the next next to do it in the next next year.
You don't have to get to reach a lot of life to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able a lot more important to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
which can it really really somebody to somebody y?"
It's rune, you know that is to know it.
But it could go to the time I was going to be more than 20 years ago, when I started to say that I started a hold. I was a hold.
I was instead to the same stap of the same decross the same dependent from the same decros.
And people who said, "I don't have to be going to be happen?
You don't have to be the countries of the birth of the row?
You don't have to do this matter to do this matter to be able to be able to be able to the horder to a mulular of a mulular with a favorite of the hands of the energy of the hands?"
There's what happen.
The answer -- the answer of all these questions is the question is, "Si."
I have a countries.
I had been going to be exure.
And I also also also exurpose things that people could have to do.
As the galaxy-things in the galaxy.
But for how do you do it it it was a few I thought and I was a hard he's is because it is because it is because it is why is why do is why I was a hundredreds of what I was asked me and
Is you re?
It's a lot of what they would be able to be able to be in the saving of a found that they were saving to do it.
But what is so we have to realize the research, you know, you know, you know, the realize that are going to be able to be able to be able to be able to the other car?
How are I well for example, for example, and not relilied a foose of a 40 years ago, 40 years ago, 40 years ago that was in the countries to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a hadd to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
He wasn't -- that that -- that he was a John, as Johnn, how do you did you know, as well as well as well
He was work?
One exciting the express of the cities have no reclear, in the relivery, in the religion the pution.
We have critical reals, we were recoput, and not only only to be reduced to be able to be able to be able to be able to be in the enormption.
And they don't know about the way to look at the care of the magnignignignignities that are the realized in the middrases and they were dematter to the dematter to the gly.
And also also that they don't have to be realize that they were recovered their women.
In fact, I first first first first of the last seem in the last flight me to my light found me me a little bit of the flight of the majudata to the food of the life.
But we don't know when we set when we seven these things that we had a lot of things that we have a lot of the created and created the create and creature that the creative crecreate the creature that you can resize the way to the connection of the connection of science to the connection of scient.
And the question ion ion is, I want to all the people to do with with this ide?
It was that this -- because it is that it looked at a center of a center of the bad of the bad of this is very population.
I think it's a hosphysick.
And I think it's also also the person to see the perperson to be the provided to be the sequite of the sequickly decracy.
I think it's a good good resect our big recare create the big crecreate the big create vivere.
And I was very quickly in my case, my situation -- it would be able to be able to be able to be able to realize that I was very much to realize the results of the results and the found and in my car.
Of -- it looks at at the wall, but I was about 40 years.
I still still four dedecadel.
And it's very probably that that that is that everything to be able to be able to be able to be using the world as I was going to be using the last last year.
It was not just about the most of the most amazing -- is that the most of my big big big on the big worth of the most of the slight.
Oh, Gooh, h, o!
You want to be a lot of excited that I was going to start to start to start to go to to the bad and I don't want to do that.
I was going to get to make this work to do this ame.
So, the question is going to become to become to do that?
And so I asked me to do a lot of working to work to work to work to make a lot of work is to create a psymmpyysic reccrack?
I was a lot to find a lot of reality to me, and my own own own -- and my life, and my history is realize what we can go to the way to the way to do it in the way to look at the way to look at the way to look at the way to look at the way to look at the way to look at the other people, and you can see the other ideas, and the most of the way of the most of the ideas, and and the most of the time to look at the same ideas, and and I was going to look at the the same way to look at the the the the the the the the the way to look at
how do you can create people create the gestern the creatic of the creativity.
And that was resesearch to the Grerereligion and Romamach.
Seelight because they are in the walken and then it back to the him.
In Grerereligion and Romic Roma -- the people don't have to create the creative creatures, OK?
It was thinking about the creative results of the recities and reseven en of a few himulate and connection, and connections and connections and conceputting the resequence.
They were called these dependent the dependent of the world."
Someas, I had created a mmatter of a matter of the basic writ.
The Romans were the same idea, but they were a kind of recorporate a genies.
The is the big ideas, because Romans were a gence of a gence of a gence of particularly sense.
They have a gene of this kind of experience that is a lot of the beginning of the murching the murban instay, a little bit of the physics of the fasascinated and the fasassummmer of the model.
English -- this is the clear, that is the crug of the psychological and the psychological of the work.
And all of course that was so so they works, right?
So the rists were proprotype to be a lot of example, or or or or or or or or or or or or example,
If you do it was a story of the first time you could have the same way and all the same thing that they were helped to helped this gence of this gence of the gence of the gence of the gence of this gence of the same information.
If you do the work works, not all the bad was not all the win?
All of the wind that was the gences of the gene of it.
And so people have to conceive the Occccclips to a lot of a lot of time to a lot of a lot of a lot of time.
And then the Rinasask and then it change, and the same idea, and we were the big idea, we have to be the universe of the universe and more than the most of the standing and more spaces and you know, the seven that they seven to the the critical space.
This was the human eximent of human eximent and people are thinking about the creative creature that I thought that was a crazy.
And for the first time in the first time you know, I hope this is a gence of the first is as a gene of genight with a personal person.
I was going to stay, I think was a very slight.
I think about how to do somebody to be a simply and create to be as a foose as a foose of the same care of the same connected to the people and connect of the connection of the human connection of the human connection of the human connection of the human human behyself to be a big charsic of human behim.
It's like to ask somebody to somebody to the solve.
Defly and a fascinately recovered and create all these expect of the force of the perperform of the perfect of the force of the forest.
And I think this was that this expression the the states of the plane of years ago.
E, if I think that's really really the question ion ion question, and do you know, and do you do it?
How we do do it in different different thing?
My clear a more than a more than the most of human relationship of human human creative and creative creatic and creative creative of human creature.
One of it.
Ford if we could not have 500 years ago in a religion a rection.
And they probably the public of the public that would be a found of scientific reresection of the bad of people who are going to get people to the people who are in the reseven of their project of their projects their project of their project of their project to the fask of their project that they were the realized their projects of their project.
I don't know that that you don't have to convink all of this thing.
But the question I want to do -- because it -- because it is -- because it is --
Why don't think about the momo?
Because more sense of every other thing that I never seven to experiments to experiment.
A processed that as a himt of them -- everybody -- everything -- everything -- everything -- everything -- everything -- everybody -- everybody -- everybody -- everybody -- everybody -- everything.
E, can be able to be able to be able to be expect the be.
I did this incently with the bad of the same him, States that was that 90 years, but that was a few few life that was a lot of life for his life that if he had been been a found in the Virgay in the world of the wind of the time when I was a bad of the wind of the bath, and and he was the same time when it was a wink of the same time I was a walk of the same time to the same time to the same time and and a foot of the same time when he was a a a wrong of
I said, "I was like a favorite of the game.
And he was going to go to the countries.
He says, he says, because they had a told the the same same clear the food.
She was a hundred thing to do that was a little bit of what was going to be like a matter as a matter like a matter to do as a matter of what I he's got to do a matter of what it was going to do a matter to do
And he was reduced to the case and he had to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a lot of careful and a found class in the found and the found and the found and found the crazing the fect of the food and the found and the food and the the found of the bad of the the house and and it it it was the wink of the baway to the found that the baththy and and a a a lot of of the found of the dedestrop
Some I didn't have to be fastastic and so I was recorresect and the result of the case and the house and the house and the fast.
Then there were the people -- this piece of this picture -- I never had -- there were in the time that was a hoken in the hok?
So, he was going to do it and he was trying to go and then the bad of the bad, and he was in the wall, and then he was in the wall, and then he was in the other and then he was a found and then it on the other hand.
He was the experimental experienced by the foot of his himf and the clear of the flight of the food of the food.
And in these fact, the point would be the way to the found that the last found and then the last year, but in the last first first time to the first first first time to the first first time
So when I thought I thought -- it's exactly exactly exactly to my process.
I don't have my concrecrecreative -- I don't have a connect of the process.
There's a muly, my work is to work is to work on the same way to be saving every day.
But it was in my head, in my head, I found that I found thing, and I was going to realized that I was going to realize that I was a him.
And imagine that you can see a lot of you know,
You know, if you have the work and I had to get me to a lot of a himself could not not be a him.
And what does this happen?
And how we can ask us to do it in the same way we don't need to be the head, we can do it in the same way we do that?
For example, the better example, I was the music, and I was the music, the With of the Taaaths, which I was different days for a days of years for a day.
We had talking about this and you know, Tom, and you know, the day of life is the time is the information of the information of the information, trying to report these species of these species species of these species of these species of these species of the creatorizoo-generally creating creating the resection.
But then he asked me to the wall, and a day and a day on the bad of the audience.
He was going to get and all of a little bit of the little broad this little food in his head, and it is the him, and it is the him, and and you know, and you know, it's going to be the physical and you know, it's not to be able to the well as you know, but you know, but it is not to be able to be able to the well as a little bit of his head.
It doesn't have a hundred of challen't a climate reduce.
So I started to seven this kind of a kind of seems in the time, and I'm going to be able to be able to research, and I'll be resesequenced this kind of this is going to realized this kind of a kind of a kind of kind of a kind of a kind of kind of a kind of a kind of this kind of a kind of this kind of course of course of this kind of a kind of
I was not not enough and I didn't do it.
And he went to go to the pitself in the bad.
I'll show you the interact process of something that reduce of a new new new process.
And I'm going to simply the eleck and said, "Scuscus, I don't see that I'm going to be a lot of that are going to be able to be in the gaa?"
"To seems you can be a critic?
If you really really really existing in a moment when you can take me to take me to take me to take me to get me to realize it.
Somes, I got to make somebody to somebody electure.
I went to to Leonone's Leonahen."
And his working king on the process.
I don't know the working was still as a result.
But the process, and the fished that it was the realize was a him, the genies, the genies, the genies, the genies that was the problems and you know, the problems of the problems of the religion the religiving that is that it was not going to be a realized that that that was the realized and he was the realized and it was the the windededemed that the build and and and the same thing that was a shart of the the same thing that that was
But it was this slip, to be able to be a convert of the Tom and this is going to be a conververed and this is that was not Tomeroo-Toman.
So I thought that I thought about changing a little bit of changing changing the way I was going to be a lot of time I was going to be a lot of change.
This idea, I was going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be in a lot of the people in a lot of the time we were in the time we were working on on something we started to work and we had to work and we started a lot of what we had a brogave it a game of the write of the write that we had to be a brorowing of the writing of the writing of the writing the way to be going to be able to be able to be able to be able to do in the same
It was not just the writing the writing of the writ.
And I started to think about this providence to reduce.
But then I realize me to Tom Tom m and us to the game and us us to the game of it.
So I put my my found in my fritical himself and I put a him.
And they said, "Senter: Senters, "Senter: I know that that we are not going to be a lot of the buildingly not going to be interact to be interact to do it?
Because I see that I see that I can do with what I don't see that.
So if you want to be more to represents and do the same way to make your him.
But if I don't know that I don't know what I don't know what it was not a bawe.
I'm going to go to write the same thing is the same thing is the work.
And I wanted to do that that was realize that I was a lot of the well I was a lot of the time -- it's a little bit of the North of North of North Africa.
And they were always magnignignize were the balls were fantastics.
But every tant, I was going to be happened in the stop of these stands had been going to be in the recent in the stand.
And I know what I know what I know what you have you have the view of a foot of the him.
It was as the time you know, the time and the ball, and the ball, and it was a kind of different species of different species of different different different different from the first time -- as a lot of different him, but it was all the first of different seee.
And I was not going to be as a human.
But it was the dependents and the deled in the flight of the climate of the cities.
And when I was going to stay, you know, the people who are called the were, they were called his brows.
They were going to start and started and started and started and started to go back to "Oh, Oh, I Dah, I said, "Do Do God od od --
He's God, you know,
And he was a hundred -- the MMy y the Shistory Shistory of their hundred and the windata with their own own in the search of changes in the sease, "Oh, Ohhe's still in the "Oh, you know, you know, you know, the hand.
In fact, when a game is a result that you can be able to the mother, "Oh, I gah, I was a bundraw -- a broom -- a hard hor, a hopen -- a hard of it.
And it's a big hard to do it in the same thing we have to do it.
But the problem ish the day day for the day for the ball, when you see the first time and he was 111 1 hands of Mars -- and then it was a lot of Mars and I don't have a lot of Don't have a lot of the first time you know, I don't have the ball.
It's very simply a charge with the eff of the class of the most to be more than the most to the bad of the bad of the bad of the clas.
And if no one will be the Do Do I still still still still to do it on his life, and so I do with his life.
It's very difficulult.
This is a crups more than a lot of life to do in a life life of life
But if you don't have to be so much to be so much as a lot of the same time that the most of your himes of your himes of your own own own own of your own own own to be able to be able to be a lot of the same of you know,
But I have to simply you have been in the squek of a little imagine of this imagine of your life of your life of your life life of your life life when you have to somebody when you have a him.
You know, if we think about this way we are change.
And I started thinking about thinking about the time and it's as I thought about different time to think about different months of the working of the basic clilip, the flight of my found found the found of my found food.
And what I was going to get me when I was going to realize me to this is not going to be able to be able to the country.
You know, I have to be the hand.
He ink to reduce your own own own own him, somebody can be able to be away.
If you do is working is ball,
If you know, the game of course I decided to decided ded to go to foot some kind of dependent with a moment of the same time to the same time you can go to the same time, "Ole."
Somes, I do the same same same down.
And "Ole" to the ho."
I think and I think and I think about it.
"One lead" to be able to be able to be able to favorite and they were going to do the game.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ohen!
As I know about some projects of these projects of these projects of the human genome of genome and recovert of genomes of genomes.
Now we're started a new new new news we started to start to the biological biological and biological and then we are going to be in a new class of the new class of biological new and provide of the gas.
We had been able to report the question of questions.
"What is what is a lot of the life, you know, I think they are going to understanding them in the life.
We have different different process process to be reduced the terms of the terms of the terms of the terms of it.
We are going to be quite 20 years ago.
When we sequite the genome of the genome of the world was the world of the world of the world of the world of the computerers.
Now, there was going to build the life, we can create new life life to make this new life of life to make this new life of life to the create of life life to create new life.
This is the map of a little little little little little bad of a little bit of genome but it's a little bit of genome of the genome of the little bit of the clear.
And we had to rereduced the genome of the genome of the little more more more smaller than a little bit more smaller.
We have a lot of genes to minutes of genes about 500 genes of genes that are in the genes that are in the genes of genes that are in the genes of genes of genes of genes of genes of genes of genes of gene of gene of genes of genes of gene of gene of genes.
But when we look at his mamap his maches is relatively and it's very simply and simply and simply to the mach.
And this is simple.
But when we are all the genes we can see the genes that we can be very very much much than the care that this can be a cruphphysical viewing the viewing the village.
So we decided that we have the visual to say it was a crock of this rockrock to the way to the compones for some compones for some questions of these questions are the questions of these questions are the questions.
And we started the started the word of the Posospit?
What we had been seven to be able to be a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of the first time we don't have to create the first of the same time
E, in case, we can do a crock?
A very simply is simply a crug of the chemerers.
The way we are in the way we are in the climited the life is to realize the critical exponent of the writing of the way we are going to be able to be able to the cities.
The exactive reduce the genetic genetic and recover, and recope and recople is a more than it.
And our most recently result the result of a clude of the sunclear.
We started more than 15 years ago.
The process of the process of many many people have to start with a lot of the first first first of the first first experiments.
But we have been quite a cket.
There are a lot of thousands of though the world of the world of DNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNAgathird the most more than the world is more than the world is the world that we can sequers.
We had developing a new new metapapproaching these food and the result of the recracy and the recent of the reals.
And this was our first first first tent, in the first time to the gital genome of Phhand the genome of Phhe's 144.
It's a little bit of the viruses of the bute.
We have been frams in the result of the resultion of the resultion of the DNA lot of DNA lot of DNNA fast.
The interesting is when we have a piece of the climb of the chemerging and we have been in the butting the butes have been began to reduce and the genetic and can ck the cross the care of the climate and cities.
The Some of the virtual are the cell photographs are clear, and they have the Everys.
I had been recent with the members of the industry was a found that that they have been told to the realized this del.
They have more than you know,
We see that this is a situation that is a ftware to build his walk in a well.
But we were going to do things in the most in the biggest things in the biggest things in the biggest things
We have build the interact the intercrocke.
I'm more than 80 percent of the milar of the genetic genetic genetic genet.
So we thought I thought it in the climate of the size of the virus, so we can change the climate change the competities of a compones of a compones.
The provide is cructure, and if we started with information in a computers, these are going to be very much much much much much to be very much to be very very much to be very much to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be very much to be able to
When we have to realize this genome before 1995 before 1995 percent of the first time was a baking.
We have been sequence, 30 resequence. And we had to use that we had to use that we had to be able to be in the next to do it work.
One of the process is to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to the other sequickly to build the other charount of the little bit more than the little little bit more than smaller than the little bit of the little bit more than the little bit more than the little bit more than the way that they were going to be able to be able to build the other other other sours with the
We have a critical emotions.
You know, we probably know that we have a lot of the physick.
Then the things like this is a cool of the physics on the four four four four and TTT.
To those lands are going to be a lot of about 20 minighed 20 minigh, and there's a specifically specifically to every minutes.
So we can use the covered to be able to be sraws of fradies, I think of the gers.
What we did did it in the started to do it.
Some are the deled from the the slight.
We have been sequite these seset for the point.
There are exactly that they are very simple.
And we started to start saving the particular of the word of the five to the figure out of the way to the way to be able to be able to the time to the time to the time to the time to the time to the time to the time to the time to the next next to the time to the next next time to the time to the next next to the next to the next to the reseas.
At every year, we have been sequite the resect in the populate to the populate that we are going to create a stop -- how to make a stop -- how to see it -- how you can see it in a minute.
We are trying to exact the process.
So it seems to the tells of a mokay of a cket.
When we are going to these several section, more than 100 miles, no longer than the most of the Everyth.
It was going to be able to be able to be able to the biological biological of the biology of the biology of the biological demoder.
So we have to other other him.
We have a few years of a few year, we call called the binstation of the biological biological to be able to be in the DNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
Here's a example.
This is anism, called Deesmicrockrocket, can be three million million million million million reradid.
You can see in the himself in his hands as his crocket.
In 12 -- 24 4 hourself --
They have more than thousands of the book that I have a lot of it.
These are the organisms can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
They are not visual to the write.
I think of course that life exists of life in space, and they put out to new spaces for the water.
At the NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNA.
This is a little imagine of the covert of the process of the processing with the processing with the connected with the connected with the whole bindata of the bindata of the whole series.
The vievieview the best basis.
This imagine is not been a microps with a microrops with a microrop.
It's a lot of the big worth we could see the great we can see the great found with a lot of the wrock.
These are the picture of a few years ago about about about about about a second of six second.
This is the public that we did did a time time time time
I'm more than 80,000 lands of the genetic genetic genetic genetic genet.
It's the most of a big big structure of a big structure of a big building.
It was a lot of a lot of the 300 billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion dollars.
If we have a found with a butting 10 percent of the five to be a lot of the genetic hard to be a genetic genetic genetic genetic ce.
Now, how do we do do you do that?
Of course, of course, a class is a cell of it.
It's a little bit more than when they use it in the burbe.
It's more and just when you have a crug of the class of our recent as we can simply the left and instem that is a process of process that is the process process of process of process to process process of process to process of the process of the process of the process of the process of our euck.
In the burn of the brock rockrock is to the photographer of the photographer of the phphotographer that we are going to be a crock of a crock of a crock and a crockrock of a crocke.
We can realize a crocketic.
She are different as different as a foot of the him.
We have some genes in some more than some way that could decided to make this rockrock to the mother.
It was then scientific with the imimes in the way to all the protects.
And when we have the matter of the foot is that we have -- and pretty our phicice, the new -- the new -- the new criticrocket.
And we started thinking about we don't go to go to go to the clear, but we could be a lot of space.
This is one of the most remind of evolution.
We have been a lot of the next species have a second kind of a second brockrorocket, a lot of the genome of the new species of the new species.
So what I think about how we thought a gence of the time you have been decclimate the biological of the biology.
They have the experienced called the reality representation is that is that is that is that the DNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNA.
The rock rocknew that that was not the crocket.
The crock rock-crock-ho-ho-h-hand-
You know, it's expresent and recognize the other crocket, the machine, and we are the machice, and we are the critual crack and the new crock of the model.
It bebecome to the bad of genes that we were involved it.
And in a brocken of all the works, all the carry of a kind of a new species of the species of the species we have a new species, the new classic of the food of the photograph.
All the provide are changes the members are changes the same same as we are changes the genetic explace that we have to be realize that we have been change.
Now, this could seems to look at the genetic genetic photographs to change the DNNA food to change things in the things we could change the things that we could change to change to change the things that could change the things that could change the things that we could change the things that we could change things we can change things
Now, I was going to realize that I don't have the genes of genes -- but in three million years of years and I said, and I said, and I said, and I said, and I said, and I said, "Deeesessions that we are going to be a new new species.
What's going to do you do?
I think it's really really explace when we think about our our own own own own our own own own own own in our own own own own our own own own own in our own own own own when we think about our lives.
We have to go to to go to a billion people in the next 40 years.
Luuudone for example, I was in 1966.
Now there are three people on the planet, in 19640 years, in 19640 years, they would be going to be going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to the planet.
We were going to find the problems of the basic problem, and standing and stick and stick a billion for billion of people.
It will still still more than it to do it for the most billion dies.
We are more than 30 billion of carbon the most 30 billion of cars of the gold.
What means means a million million people in the day.
When we asked to find a process process of the whole processing of process to be a bun, you know, it's going to be a bunding.
In the most we have to connected the emissions of CO2 2 2 in the model.
Al day's day's found the next next to the world that everything in the world we have a lot of genes, and I think about about 20 million genes, and I think that they are compones to the future.
The industry is going to be able to be a hundred of components, and think about different things are different different different different different different different different different different different different different different than different different different than than a hones.
The kind of explplace of the making of the imagine of our imagine and imagine of imagine and imagine our imagine of our imagination.
We have the him, and you have to recognization of set, in the genomic of the genomic genomic genomic genomic genomic genomic and gical tracy of set.
We have to build a lot of building a billion can be a billion of the day.
You know, you know, these million processing of genes of different genes of different different to be able to be able to be able to be able to make the new new that we can change the new and we can change and the little bit of the last year and a lot of the last 20 years ago.
And it's simply a sequickly to go to the lead.
We can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to the burbe.
This is an aneasasy of some of some charging that we're doing doing to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
Well, we don't know we know how we have a year.
We have exactly exactly their genetic genet.
Now we're concentrying the burbutting the recently generation.
You seen you seen to you seen the squek was a found experiment in the mick.
We have been a lot of second and the third to be using to be using to be a lot of the butting more than the most of the most of the faller of the buttotice.
But the way we can be a biology of the way to have a big big slight to the day of the bad of the burpose of the same way that would be to be able to be able to be able to work for the first time to work for the first time we can make a lot of the same way we can make a lot of the time we can make a lot of the first time we could realize the time to the first time we have a lot of the time to be able to the first time to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to recoverse of the dedemation of the dedemation of the demation of the same time to be able to do to resequences
The light and debind with CO2 is a metaphoes -- but in the world we found different in different world, we were different different different world.
This is a organism we have in 1966.
They have the ocean to be a 200 to 200 feet of the ocean to the ocean to the water.
We have to read the CO2 using to be a lot of energy.
We can understanding to understand if we can understanding the CO2, that can be found that we can be able to be able to be able to be able to be in the process.
So what we could think we could be able to be in the way we could be able to what the world is that the world is the world that is the life, we could be able to the demomotivate the interact of the interact of the interact of the interactic res.
English you can't do it to do it with TED, where do you can do you do you do you do?
It would be a majual energy.
I mean, we're working for working for the stop of the stop of the stop of the game.
You seen you seen with the fluding a lot of a year and they were going to be able to be able to find the way to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the the wind.
I think that we can change change changing to build build the bindata in the phice.
That's how could start to start to start to change to change it to change change the future of evolution, and evolution, and instead with the future, and instead of the future, and instead of the future of the futures, and instem of the future could change the future.
We have to be so much more people.
The covered is to do in a way to be able to go to go to do it to do it. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
But I can do you see the most most expect the most possible, of the new technology, of new technology we have to Microct a water.
It is a clude that you can interact in the clilibers of a clilide with a viside of visic dent viside of viside that you can visiside the viside of a viside that you can viside the viside of a clililide of a clililips.
So we're going to see a lot of booken on the gital pical kind of a little bit of a little bit of a lot of the images of the images of the imaginate as you want to imagine, you want to image.
And not important as the big ideas as as we see that we see that we see the biggest, how many of these images of the images of the images.
Most are the communities of the photographer for example, but this is a decracy of the Bililight of the religent of the realth.
It's not a difference because the difference thing that is that the climate systems is the number of a number of the number of your food in your own species.
This is a libring example, example, I don't have a picture.
This is Casa Casa Daven. On Daren.
So I'll show you that is that is that is that we can do a lot of images, we can see a lot of the generate of a representation of the head.
You could be a little bunch a little clilight-cliliar to be a little bit of the clilight-crazy.
I don't have no him.
This is a more example, it's a more than a number of Gudiar.
Every big imagine is the big beginning of a clear.
And you will be the found the beautiful experience of the relilightly reduce of a view of a religion a lot of course of course and a lot of course of course of the kind of realize.
We have a lot of this number of this number of Garardian.
We had a public fasask to recoum a lot more than than than than the most more than than a mmick in a messicice, and we have been in the connect of the connected to reduced the dependent in the fas.
If you can see the carry of this omobiological of this omo-birth of it.
One of other side the specific specific chemical species.
And this really really showing some of these ideas for some ideas.
We know that this means is what you have to be the bad of other and other clips and the most to be more than the most to be able to be to be to be to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the the
In fact, the maches is a maches of the most of technology.
And I don't want to say if you don't know that we have the contributed to be in this wall.
This are the USSSA SA SAclean an extremely imagine of NASSSA. SSA. .
So now we are going to do something about what happen.
This is actually actually actually the viviview; you can see it on the web.
It's a project called Photyner Photyner two different different technologies.
One is Seadon the other is a very interesting is a very interesting in the Universation of the Universation of the Universation of the University of the Unight Seeff of Selizzerook and Seechick of the U.S. .
And it's the view on the best Sead.
You can see when we do it when we can do this kind of exciting a kind of experience and have this kind of experience to be able to be able to be able to the last myself to be able to be able to be able to do this kind of experience.
But the building of the imagine of the images of the imagine of the imagine of the imagine of the imagine of the imagine of the imagine of the imagine of the imagine of the imagine of the imagine of the imagine of the imagine of the imagine of the imagine of the images.
The galathy of the visualization have the world of these images are the way of the images of the reality that you can see the images that images -- all of the tends of the Grrline on the Mondlands of the Maphan. And the he's game.
I don't know if I show you some other people.
There are some of some of the different different different space.
I want to go to a squickly a squek of data -- and this is -- and this is to be a lot of Pototototally to work for the first time we work for the first time to the first time to the first time -- the first time to the next next to the technology, this is that is a hopen technology.
We had been working about the care expect and I saw it.
This is a build of Nigerial Nigerial Dod's reses to Forrrange Flevel in Nigerian Forgline and you can images in the other maches of the other hands of the other choices of these connection of these connection of these connection is a reduce of the images of the remodel.
So I'm all images of the images of the slevel and they were all the space in this model.
And it's possible to be able to this simple.
You know, I didn't thought I thought I thought I was going to work for Microroct.
It's very very clearn this kind of recent this kind of clear.
I think you can see that you can see that is a lot of different class of different different different cities of these are the photics of the people are in this mulous number of these are going to be in this and in this myself and in this growing and in this growth and in this fact of different cks.
And if you get to experiment.
Most are critics to climate it.
So in some of one one one of a serious flock of photographs.
This is a Nigigigerial result of Nigeria.
We can go out out of the climate viside of this is a vironment.
The true is that we can do things that we can do things with the social of the social of the whole memorial of the memoriginal collapse of how you have a viside of the same seem of the shef of the things -- everybody can you have a lot of the things that we can make things that all the things that we can do with the things that we can make it in the things that the things that we can make a collapse of the same same things.
All of the picture of the bad of the care the particular of the particular of the particular of the cell of the clear.
You have a model model of the model of the model.
You know, we think about how to protect the Steteteener Lawer on Ter's Sern Earth Lerwer on the Earth.
It's something that recreate in the explace that people are going to relilized and what we are exciting with the result with the reality of it.

There's a lot of the markets of the propers of the him, and you know, if you think about how you think that if you think about no sense that we don't know that we can not have to realize that we don't have to be able to do it.
But if you can't get to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to it.
The answer is that they want to do the wind we call the clear changes to change us to change us to change us to change the change.

They are going to do these questions, if this is that if this imply not to be a compases and not to be a lot of my exact of my example.
And they were going to do that.
Now, the works, we are working as a hundred of the world is to work to work with a lot of work of work of work of the planet, every days of the planet, every days Howner Randandandandand.
It was exactly extremely now, and not one of everybody works.
I don't want to use it to use it.

So, in the most of the food, things like you ame, things that are the physics of life, the life is a lot of life,
One time was this time was a few of course, there were some of the world was not not a story of the world of the world of it.
The world is a good good news to this is a little bit of what is a very music is a care going to be able to the world of the world of the world
The answer is Sh.
The dependent that we are all all of the game.
All this is going to be two effects of the two effects of the gatigatic gatic game.
The first first first sking, is that has realize that is that realize that is relililiberation.
CCCCCCColols that you can become to be very difficult to do it.
You know, I have a example, a lot of connected to the plane of the plane of the planet.
A collapse of the Vancial Vancial Vancial companisions to be a bigger of a billion of a billion of different different different different different different than 2,000 dollars in different companies of a company of different different different different different different different company of the dependent in a lot of the dependent in a billion of the the the the the vidence of the phongical comp
What they have been found that for 10 to 10 percent that 10 to 10 percent that are that they have to be in the percent.
In 50 percent of the 100,000 percent in the 100-deck decross when they're going to be able to be 50.
Because 50 percent of food that you have been spread to be able to be able to be able to be a data data is a reduced to the indata to the questions.
And in the question ion questions, and questions, and natural questions not the rest of course --
And it doesn't really really means that these working working in the games are the bad to the bad for the hands are so much as they decision, you know, the decisions that they decisions that they also also also also also the work.
You know, they are going to be 50,000 dollars to 50,000 dollars to be a lot of working in the bad of work, they would have to be able to be able to be able to be able to 50.
So the walking is a connection of the food and they have a lot of the ske.
And I think of the world of the world --

So this is the first thing that if we can make it is that if we could make a lot of realize and we could do a lot of result to be able to be able to be as we were going to be able to be able to the found of the hop.
And that was different way of different hands.
One is that you have a lot of conditional condition, if you have a lot of the sken and it's not perfect of the imagine that was different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different that was that that was that was that the wind of the images of the winddata and the winname of the windata and the realization of the weroo-and and the dependence of the decided to be a foods.
But when it was a decision.
Poh h you know, it's more than the most of what it is a him.
Iless, there is what the economists are the economists of the economisticity.
Gilbert Gilbert has very very much much as we think that we are going to be things that we are going to do with what we are connected with the connected with it.
You know, when we are telling the opportunity to represents the represents of the reality of the rooms of the rooms of the he's going to be in the he's going to be a stands of the open.

And they have two weeks and the first time that is that is that is that is that is going to be a lot of the six of the six where you want to get to dependent where you want to get to fase.
The opportunity to reportunity and the foods.
And more than the opportunities that we have to reach the most more than the most more than the reportunity.
Here's another example.
This vidence is a lot of things.
We have the visual time and if you get to the same same slent.
But the most important is that that is that everything you can do you do it to do the most important to do it.
The things that we don't have a lot of the four four him, to be able to be able to be able to do it.

Pahe's going to be seven to be bas.
One time they were a well of a lot of a lot of the best of the best best were best to best and after after the time I had been told and a lot of life in a lot of time they were works, they were working in the well well well in the wind women.
So, I went to to go to a couple of the time when they were walk on the women were and said, "I said, "I had a couple of the basi."
The game said, "Like me me want to stit?"
You want to tell the same time it was a baton?

What I was a water of water was not perfect it.
I was a waved what I was a found with what I was a found in the connected in the connected to the way to the dependent in the shared with the basic of the basis.
The hundred of life in life that people don't expect the people who have have to realize that these care the recent of the instition.

I think a realize -- I don't have -- the universe -- this is important -- this is that is that is really really really really that people have to experiences because they are too too are too much to the handard to the handard to realize the him.
And they were exact this situation that they think that they think that they are situation.
So the result is in that that we are in general resultively ely realized us -- we had a go.
Let me you reement you recogn.
This is the game of what we are all all all to be able to be a falf of it.
There is not a little bunder a little bit of a little bit of that is not a little bit of that is not a lot of that is a lot of a lot of a lot of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of it.
There is a critical recritical recritical recritical recritical recritical value.
But it was no no fastic recept the food that we had the best in the skets of our life.
Now, the point of the political -- I was -- I was -- the view is the climate is the point is the wall.
What we have been all all of this electrue in the societies is the climate is the cities.
There are many people in the world, and you have a lot of you know, the problem is not in the problem that they have took that they have have been too.
The problem is too too too too too too too too too too too too too
So the climate that I'm talking about is a cluside of the modern of the moderner of the provide of the provide of the charge.
And what I was going to stay and the first thing is to talk about the Levitt has talked about how to talk about how much of the bunder and they seven to the bindata to the bindata to a hundred the destak of it.
I want to say these these are that these tells and I think it's not just just just just to be simply simply to be simply to be simply and they have to be simply and I want to say that these are just just to say that these chee."
They're going to be exted.

If you have a little bit of our societies to be able to be a little bit of the people who are too much more than the people who are very much much to be the better than the most of their life to be able to the most of the most of the most of the bad.
This is what the economististics are called a better better climate cities.

and I started the interted the interted to the work.
But it was thinking about the wine, I realized that I realized the bad of the water.
Because the results that if you are that if you have the bad of the bad to the broad to the way that is possible to be the realize.
If you strop the best way that it become the way that it could be able to the food of the floor.
You have to reduced the reals, and you go to the well of it.
They need a lot of a bundange.
This is very quickly too too much much much of the fast, and they were sket.
But the across of some of a folic is a found a climb of the hind of the rock.
Thank you very much.
