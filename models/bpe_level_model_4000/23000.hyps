I showed these slides to show that slide to show that the calculation that the artical calotter -- which for almost three million years has had had the size of the U.S. continental -- you have 40 percent of the United States of continental --
But this undergrade the gravity of the problem because it doesn't show the ice of the ice problem of the ice problem.
The arty glacial calotter is in a sense, the cleaner heart of the global climate system.
You expand the waves of winter and you get it into the summer.
The next slide is going to be a quick carlled on the last 25 years.
The loss are signed in the red red red red in the red red red red
As you see, they expand it out to the blue blue blue blue blue blue blue blue blue blue blue blue blue blue blue blue blue blue blue blue --
That's the ice in the winter that you get extremely down.
You can see that the cosidential cosident ice of five years or more, is like the blood here was from the body.
In 25 years is passed from this to this way.
This is a problem because the very very interested in the ice of the ice of the artc ocean where there are huge amount of carbon congelent that are carbon as a congelated by microbial microbes.
It respect to the total quineness of global warming, that amount of global warming, that amount could double this point of not return.
In some deep Alaska little deep metan is already rebolling from water.
The professorse Katey Walter of the University of Alaska sleep-grab lllly:
Video: Wow! Al Gore: She is good. The question is if we also all of us.
And a reason is that this termal scale of the Groenlland,
This is a glacial record record --
The late took never to the levels of the website had never reach.
This is the Kangerlussuaq, in the soverversis of Groenlluse.
If you want to know how the level of the sea level of the sea ice on the ground of the sea.
These are going to be increasing very quickly.
Another part of the planet: Antarctics, the biggest block of the planet.
The last scientists have degree depended that the ice of the ice is negative, and that the Western Antarcticde occial issues on some submarine issues on some submarine submarine -- is particularly rapid in the monkey --
And it was six feet of the water, like in Groenlland, like Groenlland,
On Himalaya, the third largest block of ice -- you see new laghi, who were ice to be ice in the ice of ice -- who were ice to be ice --
The 40 percent of the world's population reception,
Sulle Ande: This ice is the source of the potable water of this city.
The lady is increased up.
But when you diminusible, the same acac water.
In California nevada on the Sierra Nevada 40 percent.
The soul issues are in crisis.
The previsions, like you read, are grave.
The growing sea seat in the world leads to a nice of incendes.
The environmental disasters are increasing to a ritory of previous and unprecedently previous and unprecedently previous and unprecedental disasters.
Four more times than the last 30 years of respect to previous precedently 75.
This is a whole thing of all insustainable of all insustainable.
If you look at the history of historical context if you can see the consequences.
In the last five years we added 70 million tons of CO2 to 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the oceans every day.
Look at the East East East East East in the Americh, and both both the parts of the suburban dial issue, where there's a radical income of the oceans.
The largest cause, the global warming, with the deforestation, which is 20, it's the use of fossil fuel fuel --
The oil is a problem, and the carbon is even worse of the worst worse.
The United States are one of the two countries with China.
And he proposed to build a lot of other central central to build a lot of carbon central other central central to build a lot of other central central other carbon central to the other carbon central to the other central to build a lot of other central central other
But we're looking at a direction of direction.
These are the projects of analynulled in the last few years and alternative evidence of green alternative evidence of the last few years and the evidence of the last few years and some evidence of the worth of the worth of the worth of the green and some evidence.
Anyway, there's a political lotta in our country.
The carbon industry and oil have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promoting carbon to promoting carbon dioximor.
That image me reminded somewhere --
Very Natal, in Tennessee, where I live, there was a 3.8 billion pounds of carbon dioxide dies.
Maybe you saw it on the news of the news
This is the second largest flower of scale in America.
It's success around Natal.
The natalization of one of the carbon industry was this.
Video: Frosty the carbon is a kind of coal and happy.
It's abundant here in America, and it makes our economy.
Frosty the carbon is always more and cleaner and more cleaner and more cleaner and more cleaner and more cleaner and more and more and more cleaner and more and more and more clean.
It's good price, adorable and the workers are going to be worth and their jobs.
Al Gore: From here is a lot of coal West Virginia.
The biggest society on the mountains is Massey Coal. This is his friend.
Video: Don Bllland, he sends -- I'm going to be clearly -- "Look Reid -- don't know what they're talking about.
Al Gore: So the Alleance for the Clima has launched two campaigns.
This is a bunch of it, a part.
Video: ALergi: At COALergic we see climate changes like a serious seria as a sery to our business.
For this first of our priority is to invest a big amount of money in a very high school to make public and consumption.
In fact, carbon is not sport.
We think it's clean; it's a good evidence -- it's a good evidence of it.
So you don't predictedly.
Let me do that.
Video: Attore: Carbone clean -- you heard a lot of it.
So we do do a framework in a structure of the avang as a clean as a clean as well.
Straordinary! The machine are a little bit noise, but this is the sound of the clean technology of the clean technology of the clean fuel of the carbon technology --
The carbon is between the main causes of global warming cause, but the night technology of the cleaning technology that you see changes everything.
To look at this is odier's odiera,
Al Gore: Infind, the positive alternative positive to the economic and the national security.
G: Sin: The American economy, the national security economy, national security crisis, the climate crisis.
The file that lines everything: our dependence from fossil fuel fuel and oil oil oil and oil oil oil and oil oil oil oil and oil oil oil oil is very important to the import.
Now, there's a new new new solution for users to use it for use.
Real America: 100% clean energy in 10 years.
A plan to reput America, to the job, make sure sure that you can make sure and stop the global warming.
Finally, a solution that you get to solve our problems.
No America. Scover more.
Al Gore: This is the last one.
Video: His is is to reach America.
One of the fastest ways of fast to the end dependence from fuel to kills our planet.
Comparsa: The future is here. Vento, a new energy-energy network.
It's about 2: Novi investment for places of good work of good work work of good jobs.
Comment: Repower America. It's time to be realistists.
Al Gore: A great great proverbial African called "If you want to go fast, go from the sun.
If you want to go far together."
We have to go far fast.
Thank you very much.
Last year at TED I did a introduction on the LHC.
And I promises of return to go back to how the machine.
So here I get her. And for those that the other time is not there, the LHC is the biggest scientific experiment -- 27 miles of circumstence.
His compit is to reach the conditions that were fewer than a billion of the universe -- to 600 million times a second.
That's just the environment.
This is the machine in the Ginevent.
We do these min-Big Bang in the relevel in the relevel of the relevel in the relevel of the Whg Bang in the relevel of the relevel in the relevel of the relevel in the relevel.
This is what I work. It's called AS -- is called AS -- it's like 44,000 feet and has a 2,000-feet diameter of 2,000 feet and 2meters.
This is an image image of ATLAS in building so you can see the proportions.
The 10 sect last year we have accepted the car for the first time.
And this picture was taken by ATLATLAS.
It was because of immense immense in the room of control.
It's a picture of the first particle of particles that made all the LHC, entering into collision, deliberately, with a part of the LHC, and spreading particles.
In other words, when we saw that image the 10 sect secember, we knew that the machine working, which is a great living.
I don't know if it was this to do it extra more op, when somebody went to Google and saw that the page, and vids that the beginning.
That means we have a cultural impact beyond in the scientific impact of the scientific impact.
About a week later, there was a problem with the machine, because of these films here -- these dors.
These films take 13,000 printing when the machine works at the mouth-powered power of power.
Now, the technical of you will look at the films and diranness, "It's not true. I'm films.
And instead can do it because when they're very fresh to become the superconducducductors.
So, at least 271 degrees, a core temperature to the stellow of the space between the stars, these films can bring that current current it.
In one of the junctures in the LHC, there was a fabrication.
So the movies are going to be reading and 13,000 printing amps, suddenly met a electrical resistance.
This was the result.
Now, this is even more impressive if you think these magnety fish over 20 tons of the 20-tons of about 30 centimeters.
They were damaged about 50 magnets.
We had to take them to leave them what we did about it.
We have repristined and updrugs and updying them.
Now they're coming back to their underneath place.
By the end of the LHC will be new unteam.
We accenderemy, and we expect to get the data to jugment or himself, and continue to find what the morning is the morning that are the morning that are the universe.
Now, of course, in a way, these accidents reaccending the debate about science and engineering the value of science and engineering.
I think that the fact that it's so hard, the fact of going to the limits, I think this is the value of things like LHC.
I would like to end with the words of a scientist Inglese, Humphrey Davy, the guy, where, in the magazine, in the pupill, his pupill, his pupill, his pupill, he said, "No is so dangerous for the human mind of the human mind, which is very dangerous as the reeffort of the human mind, which is very very dangerous as a not, which is not new world."
Thank you.
I want to start asking you to rethink about how a kid -- you play cookeys.
As you get them to get them to the way and stand and move forward, and you move forward, and you can actually think and solve problems and solve problems and make it flight-space relationships.
The space is deep is deeply connected to the way we understand a lot of the world around us.
So, from the informaty inspired by our interaction with physical objects. And I started to my Pac, and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi, I started asking her, "And if we use a computer, instead of having the only computer, instead of having the treator as a digital policy policy that you move on a digital fear that you move on to a physical information with both a digital to the sent with the sent of the sends,
and we get it to our pleasure pleasure to me?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer, building the answer, building the answer, building the answer, building the answer, building the answer, building the answer, building the answer, building the answer, building the answer, building the answer, building the answer, building the the answer, building the the answer, building the answer, building the answer, building the answer, building the answer, building the answer, building the answer, building the the answer,
In a few words, a Siftable computers like a great interactive computer.
In a few words, a Siftable computers like a great interactive computer.
You can move with your hand, they can see the handle between them, and they can see their movement and a screen radio wireless.
But especially are objects like the morning, you can just move it by simply afferrands.
The Siftable is an example of a new ecosystem tools to manipulate information digital information.
And as they become more physicists, you know, you know about the movement, others, and as they become more physicists, and as they become more physicists, and others, how we move to the new and different stilds. We can explorer new and different stilds.
He started with some simple example.
This Siftable is configured to show vide: if you include it it in a direction, the video will roll like this, if you win the other hand, if you win the other hand, you get back.
These interactive ritory are conscious of others.
If you take them to the thing is their intorororder.
If they come circumstances, they can be a little bit of it.
If they come circumstances, they can be a little bit of it.
They also have their movement and including them.
We then realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was able to use the data, to example, a color like a liquid.
In this case, we have three Siftable configured like a drink and I can use them to switch into the color of the color in the middle of the color in the middle of the color in the case, where they milk.
and I can use them to switch into the central that where they mix them.
If we have a little bit of it, we can put a little bit of it.
There are also good possibility of learning -- like languages, the mathematics and games of the logical things that people can try to the very quickly, and see the results are immediately.
Now I'm --
This is a Fibonacy of Fibonacy program.
Here we have a game of words that is in half of Scarabeo and Boggle.
Basically, at every turns, I got a letter to every Siftable, Prrically, every turns, you get a letter to every TSiftable, and while you try to compose to a dictionary.
And then about 30 seconds are remissed and you have a new set of reading and new possibility to try to do.
Thank you.
And here of the children came to the Middle Middle Lab, I did it so that they tried them and I turned a video.
They are pleased to be a lot of it.
And one of the interesting things about this kind of application is that you don't have to give people a lot of education.
You just say, "Compone's word," and they know exactly what to do.
That's how other people who try it.
This is our younger testers --
It actually wanted to be a multimately multimately to them.
They were only morning, for him.
Now, this is an interactive carton interactive carton.
We wanted to build a tool, to learning the learning of the English English is Felix.
It can be able to put new characters in the scene, satiss; they can be able to put together new characters.
It can be able to put new characters in the scene, satiss; they can be able to put together new characters.
He's doing the sun.
Video: The sun is surprise.
David Merrill: Now has brought a treatment in the scene.
Video: The arancient treat.
Bel work!
So when the Siftable and put it close can interact the characters --
Video: Bau!
-- by inventing the story.
Video: HHHo!
DM: It's a story with the open final concern and it can decide him as you know.
DM: It's a story with the open final concern and it can decide him as you know.
Video: Gol: Gold, four.
DM: The last example I have time to show you is a tool, made recently, to sampling and exeguing music.
It's a tool, made recently, to sample and exeguing music.
The Siftable here are acting from sounds like base, base, low-down, and bacteria --
Every one of these has four different variations, and you can choose what you use it.
You can put these sounds in a sequence that sounds in a sequence that you can pleasure to your pleasure in your pleasure of it.
And to modifice it simply touch a sound."
These are actually actually that you can control over the way, like the reveration and the filters
The attacks to a particular sound and then including them to the stand in the starts to update it.
And then there are the general as time and flouous, which is apply to intersequence.
We look at how it works.
Video: We will we put a basic in two Siftable "sequenc," we go into a seriously, we get into a seriously, we add it in a seriously.
Now I put a bass line.
Video: DM: Now I add percent of the
Video: M: And I'll put the filter to the bacteria, so I can control the effect of living there.
Video: I can fast the whole sequence with the time from a side or from the other.
Video: M: And now I'm add to add the filter to the bottom to the lower expression.
Video: I can recombined the sequence "volo."
So I don't have to plan before, but I can sudden, make a longer longer or more cord.
And now, finally, I can sfummming the whole sequence on the Siftable "volume."
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is to build new interfaces man-seats as as our brain and body.
And today, I had time to show you one of the results, and also some possibilities that we try to get out of the lab that we try to get out of the lab of the lab.
The concept I want to turn is that is that is coming this new generation of objects designed to interact with digital media media in our world in the way we want.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the time to talk to all of you.
I'm a writer.
From books is my profession but it's more than that, of course,
It's also love and the fall of my life.
And I don't expect to change.
But, I said this something particularly happened recently in my life and in my career, who took me to realibrate the whole relationship with this job.
The particular thing is I recently wrote this book, the biography called "Mangia, Prega, Ama," the quality of my previous books, for some reason that you know, a big sailing, sensey bestsells, for some interaction --
And the result is that everywhere you walk me as if you were convictims.
It's true -- convicted -- convice.
They all come from me to all worried and say, "You don't have to do it not get to do better.
You don't keep writing to write for all life without being able to create a book that could important to create a book that could important to somebody?"
that could care about somebody?"
It's rassicurant, you know,
But it could go worse -- I remember that more than 20 years ago, when I started to say to people -- I was a training adolescent -- I wanted to be a writing.
I would go on the same reaction based on the land.
And people said, "You can't have succeeddy to have succeed?
You don't fear that the humiliation of the refute to kill?
You don't fear to do this mestize for all life without that anything you ever come out and die on a cumulation of swook with the mouthwing with the mouthwing of failing energy.
So, you know,
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is "Yes."
I have a fear of all those things.
I always had fear.
And I also have a lot of other things that people could not be unned.
As the algae and other spaventy things.
But, for how much you write about what I thought and ask me the last and ask me the last because, why is that?
Is it rational?
It's logical that anybody should expect to be pavented by a job that you feel born to do.
But what is there so particular in the imprese creative to make sure that you have to be about the mental health care in a way that other carefully you don't do that?
As my father, for example, he was a chemistry engineer and I don't remember one time in his 40 years of activity that he asked if he was asked if he was afraid to be engineer to be engineer to do that?
It was never -- that block of the engineer engineer how do you see?
It wasn't how much it working, right?
Onestly, chemical engineers like group have not certainly in the seats, in the secool, as a reputation of being alcolized.
We writers, we have enough this reputation and not only writers but creatives of all genere, we have this reputation of being enormously instable to be very instable.
And it's not another one that look at the tristand the contact of the magnificent of the magnificent of the magnificent of the 1st century, and often young people and often often often to them.
And also the ones that are suicians seem to be really disappeared to their woman.
Norman Mailer, before of the last of the last interview, said, "On my book has killed me a little bit of more extraordinary affermaybe.
But we don't drink when we hear this is because we heard these things so long, we heard these things that in some way we have completely interior and accepted the notion are somehow to create a lot of the art, and the art, will always be the kind of wook, will always be on the enjoy of the doctor.
And the question I want to take all of the time today is you get to this idea?
You know, it's good to this -- because you know, even look at the distance of distance to me, not good for this supposition.
I think it's odied --
And I think it's also dangerous and I don't want to see the perpetuated perpetual of the next century.
I think it's better to encourage our great creative minds to vive our own creative mind.
And I know that in my case -- in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to start to that feel suppositions, especially the circumstances where I'm in the career of my career --
Obbble; I'm pretty young people, I got pretty young -- I have about 40 years.
I have about four decades of work in me.
And it's very likely that anything I write about now in the world as the work that came after the world as the work that used after the last book.
He slaves, because we're all more or less friends here -- is likely to my greatest success is to my shoulder.
Oh, Gesood -- which thinking.
You know this is the kind of thinking that leads a person to start to be, in the mornings of the morning, and I don't want to do that.
I would keep doing this work that we do.
So, the question becomes be?
And so I got a lot of reflective, which the way to work to continue to write is to create a psychological costruck, OK?
I have to somehow to find a safety of security between me, which is a natural where it reaction is going to get the very very short thing will be getting the last year patterns about how to do I started looking through the time, trying to find other societies to see if they could have the best ideas and healthy to see if they could have the best and healthy of healthy and healthy more healthy than the healthy of the ideas and healthy of healthy
to help people create emotional inerent emotional risks of creativity.
And that research me brought me to the Great and ancient Roma.
See because it gives in the circle and then back back back.
In the ancient Greek and anticically, Rome -- people don't seem to believe that creativity seven-year-old mands.
It was thought that creativity was this spirit watching and who came up and who came out of men from a few surprising and unknown -- and unknown -- for distant reasonable and unknown away.
The Greeks called these spirits drugs of creativity "demony."
Socry, wonderful, he believed to have a demon the wisdom from far away.
The Romans were the same idea, but they called that kind of spirit without a genius.
The one that is great, because Romans were not really thinking that a genius was a genius was a particular smart of a genius was a very smart.
They thought that a genius was this sort of a genius that created was literally in the study of an artist, a little bit like the elfe Dobby, and who came out of the article of the artist of the artist of the artist and to modeling the result of that work.
Educectural -- -- -- -- this is the distance of which I talk -- that costruck costruck that protects you protect from the results of your work.
And everyone knew that was so that it working, right?
So the antic artists were protofed by certain things, like the too narcis; right?
If your work was exceptional you couldn't take it all the demer, everyone knew that he was helped by this incorporea.
If your work fail, it wasn't all all touch, right?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be a incapable to be a skill.
And so people han creativity in the Ocdent for a long time.
Then the Rasash came and all changed this, and naquest this big ide; we put the human beings and without the middle of the universe and the mysteries that write the mities.
This was the principle of the humanth rational and people started thinking that creativity came from the ish.
And for the first time in history, you started to refer this or that article like a pretty fairly to a person with the genius.
And I have to tell you, I think it was a big error.
I think that allows to someone, a simple person to believe that being a recipient as a recipient as the source and the surprising all mysterious mysterious and a hot-like a file too much to give the fragile that human.
It's like to ask someone to ingoous,
It decreates completely the ego and creates all these ingestible ingestive on losing performance.
And I think it was this pressure to have destroy artists in the past 500 years.
And, if this is true, and I think the question is, and that?
Can we do it different?
You know, you go back to a more antic understanding of the relationship between humans and mystery creative understanding.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we can't cell 500 years of thinking of rational thinking, in a 18 minutes.
And you probably have people in the audience that would sweep, you probably know, scientific about the notion of the notion of the notion of the notion -- you get people to move on their projects.
I probably wouldn't win the whole of this thing.
But the question I would like to take is -- why do we do?
Why don't you think about this way?
Because it has more sense of anything that has ever heard to explain to explain the creative process.
And one process that you ever have to do something -- so fundamentally, all here -- yet you don't have rationalguy.
And, in fact, it can sometimes look at completely paranormal.
I did this recently recently with the Ruth poetc. Ruth Stone who now 90 years, but that was a poet-year-old poet-old in the Virginia, and he was working out in the Virginia, and he felt it was in the country, when a poem came from the land.
He said it was like a fragorous fragorous frageous frageous frageous frageous fragorous fragorous fragorous.
And he came frozing to the landscape to her.
He felt to get to the way to get the land under his feet under his feet.
He knew that point to have one thing to do to that point and it was words like a morning."
And so it would be coming home and it was following from this poetry and wouldn't have to make a piece of paper and a freeze, as the training -- as the training and it took it on the page.
Sometimes you couldn't be quite quite quickly, so it was so correcent and correcent without able to get home and the poem was rolled through and she was lost and she would continued to roll through the landscape, as he said, "another poet."
And then there were times -- this is not going to forget -- there were moments where the was almost lostly lose -- right?
So, she was going to run home and was trying to card and the poem was going through the wood, and then he was going to go through the wide, and then he said it was like to hold with the other hand the off.
He was offered the poem from and the tail and reput it in his body and transported it on the page.
And in these cases, the poem would be on the perfect page, and intattattached but the word, the last word at the first word at the first word at the first word at the first word at the first word at the first word at the first word at the first word at the first word at the first word at the first word at the first word at the first word at the first word at the first word at the first time.
So when you feel it -- it's crazy as a crazy to my creative process.
I don't think of my creative process -- I'm not a conducture!
I'm a mult, and my way to work is -- wake to go to the same orary every day and to work and go around and go over and go over and go over the bear.
But even I stand in my head, I stand on the text against that thing, at the time.
And I imagine that many of you have hit up.
You know, even if the work and ideas got me from a certain source of the kind of mind, I couldn't honestly know.
And what is this thing?
And how can we relate to that we can do it as we can do that if you do it remaintaster, plutt; what do you do about that?
And as I think about it, the best contemporary example that I have is the musicians musicianeum that I interviewed a day.
We were talking about this, and you know, Tom, for the majority of life was the incarnation of the artist store of the artist stagge, to make these kind of impulsizes of impulsize, dominating these species of impulsized.
But then I agreed that, and a day while she was driving on a car in L......, changed all for him.
He was going fast, and all a very much of this little bit of this little pray framtion as it comes into his head, as it makes the inspiration, elusive, and the want, you know, it's wonderful and the wish, you know, it's wonderful and the desire, but not as to take it.
It has no main card, not has a match of a match of a match of the recorder
So it starts to feel this sort of old old anxious to be to lose down, and remarrying the sessential song of this lost song lose seseed by this seeds to lose it, and remarry session.
I don't have enough and I can't do it."
And instead of going to go into the panic stop.
But I'm going to do the whole process and did something completely new.
He just looked at the sky and said, "Cusa, you see that I'm driving here?"
"Do you look like a song now?
If you really want to exist, you get into a more opporter when I can take care of you.
Of course, you go to care about somebody else today.
You know, Leonard Cohen."
And his process process changed after that.
I don't work -- the work was even dark as a semble bleft.
But the process, and the fishing rate that was released when the genius, the genius that was caused to him to get nothing else that issues out of him who causes all the way to be a whole thing.
But yesterday this peculier, wonderful bizarre whipping between Tom and this external thing and the outside of the external and the outside of the external conversation between Tom.
So how the story started to change a little bit how I was working and already saved a little bit of a time.
This idea, I save me when I was writing "Mangia, Ama," and fall in a fall of those disperation that we all when we are working on something and we all all when we are working on something and we can't start thinking that will be a disaster, which is going to be the worst book that ever written writing.
Not just bad book, just just the worst book writing.
And I started thinking about throwing this project.
But then I remember Tom talked about the air and trials.
So I stand my face in the many, and I would say my comments to a cool cornal corner of the room.
And I said, "You know, both of you, "You know, both know that if this book will not be brilliant not going to be brilliant, right?
Because as I see that I'm putting all of that I haven't more than that.
So if you want to be better you have to show you and do your parts.
Okay. But if you don't do it, you know, I don't know what it is, I don't know about that.
I'm going to write the same because it's my job.
And I want to do for favor that I was recorded to do my parte," because -- at the end is like this, OK, you know, at the end of the North Africa people were going to be dances of the North Africa. They were going to be dances to the wood, or the walk of the wall of the way to the albit.
And they were always magnificent because the dances were fantastic professionals, and they were fantastic.
But every single one of those artists became actually translate -- and one of these artists became actually translent in transportation.
And I know what I talk, because I know that you all of them -- a certain certain point, a lose way.
It was like the time stops and the dance, and he walk through a kind of portal portal and wasn't doing anything to the only one of the 1,000 nights, but all of the 1,000 nights --
And suddenly it doesn't appeared to appear.
But you accinese from died in the delight-fall of divinity.
And when this next time this was -- the people knew what her, was they called him with his name.
They were the hands, and started to meet up to clear, "Allah, God God, God, God, God, God."
That's God, you know,
The historical story, the Mororder, when the Spppagna, they took this abitude with their and the ready one changed in the century of "Hey, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, hey, you can get in the famena.
In Spay when a artist has done something impossible and magic -- "At the magnificent you, you know, magic -- a little bit of God.
And it's great, because we have needed to have need.
But, the problem comes the day later, for the dance, when you wake and discovered that are the 11 in the morning, and finds that are 11 in the morning of the Marted's more.
It's just a mortal with a big dead to the knee, and maybe never will never be able to the treat that alt.
And maybe nobody will be dog the name of God still as yet, and what do is it on his life?
It's hard.
This is one of the most painful reconciliations to do in a creative life.
But maybe it doesn't have to be so angoscious if you can not believe that, that, but that the most extraordinary aspects of your being being being being from you to stessi.
But it creates that you just get data in the prester of this team of the founds of the life that you have to go to somewhere you have finished.
And, you know, if we think in this way it changes.
And so I started thinking about it, and it's sure as I thought about it for several months during the work of the book that I'm going to do prestate, the dangerous paving -- the dangerous spectal success of my great.
And what I have to keep telling me when I feel electric me to do that is, not fairly land.
Last of the only one of your job.
It is to introduce presenting for your parts, any could be.
If your work is dance, ball;
If the divin, I assuming the parts of leaving a few kind of wonderful for a few kind of wonderful for a time through your effors, then "Oh, it!"
On the same thing you do the same thing.
And "Oh, you know, you know,
I think I think you should teach it.
"Yes!" to yourself, even for the human and testing and testing talks to share all going to show you continuously tracking to continue to deal with you continuously shoot to continuously.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
As you know, I've already talked about some of these projects on the genome of the genome of new genes.
Now we're starting to a new percorso: we started digitalize biology and now starting from that digital code we are both going to a new fashion biology, designing and synthesizing life.
We always tried to ask the big questions.
"What is the victims?" is something that many biological biological I think have been trying to figure out how many levels.
We tried several approach, reducing the minimes of the way.
We're digitalizing from almost 20 years ormade.
When we sequenced the human genome was going to spend to spend the digital world of biology to the digital world of the computer.
Now we say, "can we regenerate life, or create new life from this digital universe from this digital universe from this digital universe to digital universe as a digital universe from this digital universe?
This is the map of a little organism, the Mycoplasma genitalium, which is the species from the genome of the ones that can authorble in the lab of the ones that can authored in the lab of a little organism;
And we tried to reduce the genome to create a little bit more smaller than one of the smaller of it.
We can eliminate a center of genes about 500 that are here.
But when we take a metabolic map to his metabolic map to the nostry of the nostry.
It creates this is simple.
But when you look at all the genes that we can eliminate -- is very unlikely that this can bring a cellula vivent.
So we decided that the only way to progression to be synthetize this chromosomes so much as we can make the components to make the fundamental questions.
And so we started the wind of the "Can we can synthesize a chromosoma?"
Can chemistry to make these great molecules that never have to create these great molecules that never manage?
And, in case of the provide of a chromosox?
A chromosome is simply a piece of chemistry material that you can do it
The speed with which we can digitalize life is growing up to exponential rely exponential of the life is growing at exponential of the life is growing to exponential of life is growing up to exponential reflife-exponential is going to be able to digitalize the life is growing to expon
Our ability to write the genetic code, ages, progressive code, but it's improving.
And our most recent results, the leads the exponential curve.
We started over 15 years ago.
The process has required a lot of pass pass to a bioetic revision before the early experiments.
But we found that DNA is very hard.
There are tens of thousands of machines in the world that are small-century segment, the long-segment proces: the most segment is long, more exerr than the segment is long, more mistakes us.
So we had to develop a new metodo to assemble these frames and correct the mistakes.
And this was our first attempt -- to start from Phi digital information of the Phi TX 174.
It's a little virus that kills kills kills that kills kills kills kills kills.
We designed the fragments, effective of the errors and getting a molecule of DNA of about 5,000 letter of DNA of about 5,000 letter --
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemistry material inert and we put it into the bacteria started reading this genetic code and to produce particles.
The particles have been released by cells, are coming back and they come back and distruct Es.
I talked about recent members of the petrolifestyle industry said that they certainly understood this model.
They recovers more than you.
We believe that this is a situation where software can really build his own hardware in a biological system.
But we wanted to do things in large.
We wanted to build the entire chromosomsome.
They are more than 580 mile letters of genetic code.
So we thought we could build it in the bottom-up virus, so that we can change the trip to understand what the components are the viventh cell.
The design is crucial and if we start with digital information in a computer, these have to be very accurated.
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995, the standard accuratacy was a mistake for every 10 mile mibasis.
We found that, resequencing that we have the original sequence that original sequence would never be able to do it work.
One of the process is designing segments to 50 letters that are overwhelming with all the other segments of 50 letters readers to build underground underground underground underground to build underground underground underground at at the same time.
We try to reach one here.
You probably have the side that we put the flight-lawyer that we put it of the flight.
So, think of this is, we have a genetic code on four letters, C, G, and T.
Three of those letters together codifice about 20 adminioid of the letters of reading for every amminoid of reading for every amminoxide of reading
So we can use genetic code to write words, frail, thinking.
What we have done in the beginning was authography.
Some were dolphushed by the fact that it was not poems.
We designed these segments to just put them together with a fundamental concerned with the jobs.
There are enzymes that are and put them on the assumption.
And we started to get to the parts, starting with five to seven milletter from five to seven milletter to seven milletter to 24 mile lletter to 24 mile letter to 72 letter to the letter --
Anyone pass we have these sites in abundance so that we are trying to create a very robate procediment -- as you see in a minute.
We're trying to automatically automaty.
So, this seems like the tabellon a basket-basketchurch of a basket.
When we get these segments very long, more than 100 miles, they will not grow more directly in the E.
You get to the modern of molecular biology molecular biology.
So we have considered other mechanisms.
We knew another mechanism called recombination recombination recombination -- that in biology is useful to repair the DNA to unize the segments.
Here's an example.
This organisms, called Deinococcus radiohard ans, it can absorb three million rad radiation.
You can see in the square the square the square are destroyed by destroy is destroyed by destroy as his chromosome.
In 12 -- 24 hours comes reassembled exactly as it was before.
There are thousands of organisms that can do that.
These organisms can be able to touch completely.
They can live under empty.
I'm absolutely sure life existing in space, and you get smooth to find new environments of water.
NASA showed that this is that this avail.
This is a picture of the molecule that we built using these processis, simply using these processes -- using the lawyer of the segment of inserious segments to inserious segments to inserious segments to inserious segments to inserious chapter of the molecule that we built by the molecule that we built by
The lightforward carefully.
This image was not taken with a electronic microscope with a regular microscope of rule.
It's a molecule that we can see it with a little slightly read.
These are picture that cover a period of about six seconds.
This is the publication that we did a little time ago.
They are more than 580,000 letters reading genetic code.
It's the biggest molecule of a definitely structure that never created by the man.
It's got a lot of the southern a 300 million people.
If we stamp it with a 10 paper without space, you would like 142 pages only to turn this genetic code.
Now, how do we do it work? How do we active,
Obviously, you get a virus is a game by the guy who are a game by the kids.
It's a little bit more complicated when you use bacteria --
It's simpler even when it's about the cells like our ourselves -- you can just smooth the nucleus and inserirl one other, which is basically the process of cloning.
In the archaea chromosome, the cromosome, but we recently showed that we can do a cell trapit of a cell chromosome cellula to another and activity of activity in the mosome,
We clean an an an injury chromosome,
The two are different as men from the topis.
We added some gene more in a way that we can decide what choose for this chromoon.
The then folding with the enzymes in the way to kill all the protects of the proteins.
And when we put it in the cellula was stupend -- and you open our graphy graphy -- the new chromosomes went into the cell.
And we were really thought we couldn't go that we could go old, but we tried to save it over there.
This is one of the greatest mechanisms of evolution.
We found that a lot of species have added a second or a third chromosomsome, I added in a second thousands of new trats trates.
So those who think about evolution as a only gene to evolution as a gene gene doesn't understand a lot of the biology.
There are enzymes called the restrippping of restrippping DNA.
The chromosomes that was in the cellula is not a one.
The cell phony that we have inserito-a-to-a-a-a-a-to-a-a-tail.
And it turns out, and it recognized, and it recognized, and it reports like the extreme that is being being reverted with only the cellula and the new chromoon.
It became blue because of the genes that we have inserved.
And in a short lasses of time, all the characteristics of a kind of glass are lost lost the new software that we put in the new software that we put in in the cell.
All the protects are changed, members are changed, and when we read the genetic code the genetic code as what we have we transfit.
Now, this could seem alchemics, but altering the software are in a pretty substantial way.
Now, I already explaned that there is not talking about genesis -- but of progress from three million and half of evolution, and half of evolution, and I said that maybe we're going to create a new version of Cambrian explosion of the Cambrian explosion of this digital process.
Why do you do that?
I think it's obvious enough when we think about our needs.
We're going to go from six and a half billion people to nine in the next 40 years.
Just to give you an example: I was born in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for each one existing in 1946; 40 years, there will be four years, there will be four years, and there will be three people on the planet for each other on the planet to the 1946; there are going to be three people on the planet to be there.
We're going to find food, water now and cleaning and cleaner, medicines, medicines, and gas as as as a half billion people.
It's going to be more hard to do it for nine billion.
We use more than five billion carbon than 30 billion coal barrels.
That means millions of barrels a day.
When we try to find biological processes or any kind of process to replace them, it's going to be a huge challenge.
We have to keep the whole of CO2 from these materials that end up in the atmosphere.
On today, because of the scientific discoveries in the world, we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I like to think that are the design components for the future.
The electronic industry has only a dozen about components, and think about how many different things are coming out of it.
Our limits here are the data here are the biological data and our imagination.
Now we have techniques to these rapids of synthesization, can create what we call a combinative genomic genomic genomic genomic genomic generator.
We can build a big robot, robots that can produce a million chromosomes a day.
Think of process, these 20 million different genes of genes or to try to get the processes to produce either either drugs or pharmacs, we can change, thanks to create more biology biologic biology -- and create more biology now that in the last 20 years of science.
And it's just a standard selection selection.
We can choose for chance to survive, production chemistry and production of glass --
This is an instant-software programmed of some software programmed to be able to sit and designing species to the computers.
Well, we don't need it as much as they do.
We know exactly what their genetic code.
Now we're focusing on the carbon carbon of quarter generation.
You have seen that you who are ethanol, and you have been an experiment ent with it.
We have carbon on on the third generation that will use enough as the okay, or different carbon as higher as the either as the eight different kinds of throbut.
But the only way biology can have a great impact without increasing the most carbon dioxide of food and limiting the dive will be transforming the CO2 in material -- that we're working to design cells that can achieve this purpose, and we are able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get this purches of the
The sunlight combined with CO2 is a metodor -- but in our discoveries around the world, we found different methods.
This is an organism that we described in 1996.
And it lives in the deep ocean to about 2,500 feet of eboiling temperature of the water.
It creates meter from the CO2 molecular hydrogen molecular as source source as a source of energy.
We're trying to figure out if we can save the CO2 in CO2 in the CO2 in the CO2 in carbon in carbon in carbon in carbon in carbon in order to drive this process.
So we think that short we could be able to increase what the question is, "What is the victims is Noen, versuing," -- we have the modest of replace to replace the whole industry.
He'd be attactly. If you can't do it from TED, where can you do that?
It would be a primary source of energy.
And we are working on the same metods to create metods to create the instantaneous vaccines.
You saw this year with the influence, we are always address of a year and a dollar in less when it's to find the right vaccine vaccine vaccine the right vaccine vaccine the right thing.
I think what you can change in a anticipate vaccines in anticips.
And that's how the future could start to look changing, now, the tree of evolution, accelling evolution with synthetic bacteria -- archaaai, and finally cells.
We are so much from the improve people.
Our purpose is to do a long way to try to make a lot of people to try to do it out. Thank you very much.
First of all of you will see the fastest possible, some fundamental job, the new technology that we took the Microsoft in a water's watching a year asit almost a year ago -- that's Seadragon.
It's a very environmental that you can interact with a local level that remote with a huge amount of visual data --
Here we're seeing a lot of gigabyte of digital photototos with a kind of a very short speaker, and continue, for a panoramic speakers, aving the images like we want.
And it doesn't matter how much big the amount of information that we see, how big these are these collects of data or images.
Most are common photographs of digital photographs, but this is a scansion from the library, and reenters in the legal of Congress, and re-half leg, in the legal of the 300 megapixel.
It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that the prestations of a system like this is the number of pixel on your screen in any moment. It's also a very flexible architecture --
This is a book inter, example of data not imagined by images.
This is the Casa desolated of Dickens. Each colonn represents a chapter capitula.
To show you that is just about the head, and you don't image, we can do something like to see that it's a real representation of a representation of the head, not a photos.
It could be a little bit a little bit of an electronic book.
You don't recommen.
This is a more realistic example of the Guardian number of Guardian number of Guardian example of the Guardian number of Guardian.
Every image is the beginning of a century.
And it really gives you the pleasure of the experience of lawing the real version of a magazine or a fifth of a fifth of a quotidian implement.
We also did something with the angle of this number in the particular of the Guardian ardian.
We created a fashion adjust, so much more than the one that you use in a normal commercial commercial -- and we put you in a normal content -- and we put you in the trained content of the trains.
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile, you can see here.
Or other models, or even even the specific specific --
And this really shows some of these ideas to get the limits of space on the screen.
We hope that this lady to put pop-up pop-up to the pop-up pop and yeah, you don't have to be necessary.
Of course, the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology.
And on this I don't want to lose time, if you don't say that we have contributing to the field.
These are all the streets in the U.S. spinches over an image of NASA.
So now we're going to go to something.
This is actually actually from the vision on the Web; you can see it.
This is a project called Photosynth, which fights two different technologies.
One is Seah and the other is a visual research to the computer computer computer from Noah Snavely, a student of the University of Washington, with the aid of the UWashington, with the U.S. and Rick Szeliski Microsoft Research. A opopopopoptie of Microsoft and collaboration.
And it's from the vision on the web, managed by Seadragon.
You can see it when we do this kind of pattern that we can go from an image to the other and have this kind of experience to resolve solution is going to be resolution to multiply.
But the space collapapse of the images here has actually meaning.
The algorithms of the computer recorded these pictures together, so that they corresponding to the real places that corresponding to the real places where you imagine -- all of all sorts of the Flags, all of the canadede-to-the-dog -- they have been taken -- they have been clay or image and these are all the space or of a bread.
I don't know if I have time to show you some other environment.
There are some more space.
I want to spend a lot of the original data of Noah's original data. And this is from a previous prototynthic prototynththoynth-time -- to show you what I think is really the key Photosynthoynth. And it's not necessarily so much evidence at the environments that we put in the website to the environments that we put in the web.
We had to worry about legal aspects and so on.
This is a reconstruction of Noter Dame images Flickr. Bickr. Bickr. Basta Flickr. Bast, Nots Dame Flickr and you get images of the camps, and you get some kinds of around, and I would say this image that is discovered to device.
So they're all connected by Flickr and have been connected to space in this way.
And you can have this very simple.
You know, I never thought I wish to work for Microsoft.
It's very free to get this kind of a lot of receptption.
I think you can see that it's a lot of different types of framework of the photo's cell phones to those SLR, a number meaning with this environment.
And if I can try to try to find those more strangers.
Many are block by factors, etc.
Something is a series of photographs -- there it is a series of photographs -- there it out.
This is a poster poster of Notreach.
We can go from the physics of this environment.
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment. This is now being data from everyday -- from the whole memory of how to apprecise the ground from the view, from view, from the view, from the visual point of view, and connecting all the data together.
All those pictures become connected together, more than the sum of the parts.
You have a model of the land interacts that emerges.
Think about this as a promotion of Stephen Lawler on the Earth.
It's something that grows in complexity as people use it, and whose advantages for those who uses for the use.
Their photos are tunserited by other people.
If you get the idea of contrast all these sants say, "My My name of the Nots Dame sudral of Nots Dame suddenly immergering of all those data, and I can use it as a kind of sweat to immergery in the space, in the mother using the photos of wherever and have a social experiences.
Of course, a consequence of all of this are very much models of all interesting than the earth, rack is not just as a vision of the earliest pictures and satellitaries and similar memory and similar memory and similar memory of collective memory and the memory of collective moth.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I realized good? What your software will have to do is that at a certain point, in the next few years, all the photographs of all the other photographs in the world or will be basically connected together?
BAA: Yeah. That's what is doing is doing is discovering.
It's creating hyperlink if you want, you want to you, between images.
And it's doing it in the bottom.
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the rich of the semant information that many of these pictures are possible.
As you do a research of images on the Web, you know, a fruit and the text on the page page of the photo's photos.
Now, what happens if that picture you connect all your photo?
So the amount of semant interconnection and the amount of rich interconnections that is really huge classic effect. It's a classic effect of the network. It's a classic effect of the network.
CA: Blaise, it's really incredible.
BAA: Thank you very much.
One of the primary of the primary of the flight-to-search research is to live between those who has not forget the antic antic antic antic antic piets, between the walls in the wind walls in the wind walls in the flower plants.
Basti thinking that the Samans Jaguar travel even beyond the Milky Latt, or that the older of the old of the old of the Inuit or that in Himalaya, the budying are still going to remind the importance of the Dhar, to remember the importance of the ancient antiboboard of the ancient of the ancient of the ancient of the ancient of the reality, but it's just a model of the reality,
the consequence of a particular adaptation of adaptation that our stirds has done, a lot of generations ago.
And, of course, we all share the essential trates.
We all hidden we all get it.
We are subjects to start to the initiation.
We have to deal with the inesorability of deaths and whales --
We all have an art.
That colds is the particular of the cang rhythm of the can, the rhythm of every culture.
Not matter that are the Penan of the Borneo, or the follows of the Borneo, or the DVoodoo of the Kaith's desert in Kaisut in Sepentrional Ha's Curand; or a cameline in the heart of the Sahara.
He was my own own own journey in the desert a month ago, or a month ago, or a napail in the Qomom, on Everest, the mother of the world.
All these populations are teaching us that there are other ways of thinking about existing other ways of thinking, other ways of changes in the world.
And, if you reflect, it's a concept that it can give you hope.
Inside, the cultures of the world creating a spiritual and cultural life that makes the spiritual and cultural that will be the planet and it's important for the well-being of the planet as the biosphony as a whosphery.
And you can think about this ragnise like a cultural ethnoxfer and you can define the ethnox, the total sum of all the concepts, mitted, ideas, inspirations, intuitions that are being from the human imagination.
The ethnoxiety of humanity.
It's the symbol of what we are and what we can be in how much unquisitive.
And because biosphere was very very consumed as it was very much as it happened to eetnosfer and unfortunately, too quickly.
No biology, for example, would say that 50 percent of all the species was or the easter of the summer, because it is fail, or the most opposittic -- in the field of biological diversity -- and you don't have near even even even the unnear ither of the cultural ipottery -- that of cultural diversity.
The indicates of all of this is, of course, loss of language.
When you're born 6,000 languages on this planet.
A language is not only from a vocabulary or a series of gramer.
A language is the price of human spirit --
It's the half with which the animation of every culture is in the world material.
Every language is a forest of the mind, a skin, a spiritual ecosystem.
And of those 6,000 languages, while we're sitting in Monterey, at least half of the time is not more sussurrying in the children.
They don't get to teach children, which means to say, unless you get to something, which is already dead.
What is there more tristand of being flight-silence of being the last to talk a language, of not having a way to transmimit the sad of the addition or to anticipate the promise of the children?
This orring was a few of the world every two weeks of the world every two weeks a mur and door mur with the bottom, the last sillabe of an ancient language.
And I know someone to say, "Is it better than that?
The world would not be a better place if we were all the same language -- then we talk all yoruba. We all yoruba. We all yorba.
We talk about kogis.
You will be a track, what you mean to be able to talk to not talk to their language.
I would like to do a trip through the ethnosfera's ethnosfera's --
a little journey in the ethnox-fer of what we're losing above it.
Many of us forget that when I say, "different ways of exist," I mean different ways of existing existing different ways of existing existing in the existing of existing that when I say, "different different ways of existing existing in the existing of us forget different ways of exists.
We take a Barasan Barasana, in Amazonia in Septhwood of the anacony, which creates to provide from the river.
It's a population that is not able to distinguishing the blue color, because the time celests is identified in the forest of the forest, which depends the population.
They have a strange language and a matrimonial rule rule called ""Hamia languages -- you have to smarried a different language.
Everything has rooted in the pastologists, yet the particular -- in these very extreme family mathemselves to six-seven lings, no practical matrimonstry is not a language.
They are just listening to and then start talking about.
We take one of the most interesting tribes with which I lived -- the Waoran Ecuador of the nordon an incredible popular that has had the first contatts in 1958.
In 1957 mission have tried to have a facty that has been done a good mistakes to be a factremendous mistakes.
They took them into the high-dimensions that they were very much much of the plug that were very lovely to be lovely that this popular rainforest, they never saw anything bi-dimensional bi-dimensional bi-dimensional.
They collected the photos -- they have to be a shape or a shape and not finding itself in the diavole, they have killed five mission with the diavooos, and they killed the mission with the lances.
But the Waorans didn't kill only stranizes of stranies.
They kill them in the time.
54 percent of the death was caused by their own own stessis.
We have a eight generations to eight generations and we found two natural deaths and when we put it for saper, they put it in a fairly agreed that one of them was invent aging -- and then they kill it itself.
The hunters were able to recognize the animal from 40 steps and recognizing the species.
In the first 1980s, I was assigned a really interesting job when my professor asked me if I wanted to go to Haiti to be to go to Haiti to to Haiti to to meet the basis of Duvalier and Tonton Macoutes, and imposing the veleness of the velended to make the zombis.
To make sense of miraculture -- I should have to understand the Vodoun and that Voodoo is black magic magic is black.
It's quite a metaphor of the world.
Very interesting --
If you ask you to tell me the great religions of the world, what would you say about that?
Christianth of Islam, Buddismo, Ebraism;
A continent is always leavored by thinking that sub-Saharan Africa has no religious ffairly in the Voodoo and the Voodoo is not the distilled of these religious religious religious religious religious in the schims.
What makes you interesting the voodoo is the intriguing between life and death.
So you see the spirits.
The spirits can be invocated by Grande Aqua, respond to the range of dance and replacing themselves the animals in the vive way that for a short-active-active way that for a short actime-away.
For this voodooisters to say, "You want you to go to close to talk about God.
We get the time and become God."
And from the moment that you are possite you guys drive, how can you do that?
So you look at these incredible events -- following you have an extreme double impuns that touch implemented a very strong demonstration of the mind when you catalyzed in a state of extreme extremely quotation.
And in all the populations with the most extraordinary Kogi of the Sierra Nevade Santa Marckey in the Colombia in Santa secentrional sect.
The previous of the ancient civilization that once they live on the caraib-floors of the Colombia in attaca's attempt that was going to be on the vulcanic massive that would be on the volcanic floating on the carbe.
In a health continent of health, this population never been conquited by the spagnowless.
But at all of the today are governed by a click but their formation is actually extraordinary.
The young follows are being taken by the family to three or four years, and live in a world of good secret and stand in a world of stone world and stone hair for 18 years.
Two periods of nine years of proposing to reduce the nine months of managing in the user of the mother, now are metaphor of the uterad.
For this time, they get accultured to the values of their pray and only their prayers and only their prayers are going to be concerned -- or to the cosmic balance.
The first time in this incredible initiation, they suddenly took out and for the first time in the age of 18 years, see an alba. And in that activity of the first bat, when the sun of the first one, when the sun is the sun of the beautiful paper, all that they learned in theory comes conference in the theory of the beautiful paper, and he says, "Yet a past step on the pre-year-old hold hold and saying,
"You know, I got to tell you about that.
It's stupend. Now it's about you protected it."
They call them the biggest brothers and say that we we, the threats of the world.
This level of intuition is extremely important.
When we think of the Indian populations and invote Rousseau and the old environment, which is a racister concept in his simplicity or in his simplicity or magariththoe, and we say that these populations are closer to the Earth of us.
The Indigenes are not feeling about the niror from our algic herites from our dayside.
There's no space for these things in the malaric stams of the Asmat or the gelies of the Tibet, but because of the time and the rits, they created a mystic of the Earth not on a very much more subtle unition, but on an intuition of the most subtle subtle than the Earth can only live because it is infuse by the human consciousness can only be because it as unknowing the human consciousness --
What does it mean?
That means that a little bit of a guy of the Ande who grows up creating that the mountain is a spirit of Apu that will be a human being being being deep human being being being deep with the mountain or that respect to a very different relationship with the mountain or that respect to create a mountain of the Montana mountain a mountain of rocket that is an untain a mountain of the Montana who who is a very different fabase.
That is the spirit of a spirit or a mineral core is irrilevel.
And that's interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between the individual world.
I grew up in the forests, the Britannica creating that forest forest to be cut.
That has resign me to be different from my friends Kwakiutl who believe that the forests are dimora Hukukuk and the beat the wild and the spirits who live to the cannibals that live to the world north of the spirits that are going to deal with the initiation.
If you start to think that these cultures can actually create different reality -- you can actually start to understand some sensed, which is a lot of their feeling that plant.
I took this picture to aprile in the nordoctorky Amazonia
Maybe some of you have heard of the ayahuas, the most powerful support psychopactive repertoo.
That makes an ashion ayahuas's potential is not the potential for the substance, but his elaboration. It's composed by two elements.
And then then the lead of a lawyer that has a series of carboline, harmine and harmine mols, law smooth coos, law smooth and mols, law cooking.
To make the only plant blue blue-blue-to-viral fuel that you can see the consciousness of a coffee family of coffee family Psychotridis.
This plants powerful triptamines, very similar serotonine, demit methoxyltrypt-methoxyltryptamine-methoxyltryptamines.
If you ever see the Yanomami Yanami on the nose of the substance that are a different set of species, which is a different set of species,
To that polar on the nose is a little bit like being shooted by a smooth career of the barockers and land on a sea sea of electricity. Ristheless. It doesn't create a distortion of reality.
I was often with my professor, Richard Evan Shultes, the man who took the psychchchopen, with his discoveries of the psychchopen, with his discoveries in the 1930s, in Mexico.
And I think I don't have to classifix these triamines like hallucinogens because if you're doing you are not telling any of being halled by being halluciny. But they could not be absororally in the intest intestined in the intestined inter in the intestinoxidaysix.
You can just be possible to assule just if you put it on the submers that dense denses the MAO.
Now is the beauty -- the carboline that are initibats of the same kind of a very nice to potentiate triptamines. The question avoid the same kind of potential -- how these people are doing these people are flying in 80,000 species of plants, how do these populations are they not similar, but what if you combined in this way, I think if you do in this way, but what if you combine in this sudanganger?
We use the great euphemism of proof of proof and error, which can reveals infrut.
But if we ask Indians, they will tell us "Plants talks about it."
What does it mean?
This tribe, the Cofan, has 17 variety of ayahuas, who distinguished in the forest, and that they would go into the same species.
If you ask him how they are stablished their pocketry to tell us how to get plants, of the rest of the rest of the rest of them are not knowing everything?" I said, "No."
The solution is, you take 17 variety in a night of the moon and each of the wisdom and each one will be with a different different way.
You don't have this is a laurea to Harvard, but it's much more interesting than contare in the stams.
Now, the problem is that also that the ones of us that have to heart the people who have to the margins in the painting of the history of the history of the history of the real world -- and it goes beold.
In fact, the XX century, 300 years, will not be reminated for his war or its innovations of technological innovations that but rather how we were stopped and we have embracing the destruction of the planet -- it's not change.
All cultures through the century were involved in a dance for new possibilities of life.
And the problem is not technology.
Indian have not to be Sioux-in-in-free when they put from the ark and fresh as Americans have not to be Americans when they put from the horse and calmitoux.
It's not changing or technology that threats the integrity of ethnox. It's the poter.
The hard fly flit of domination.
And if you give you a look at the world, you will find that these are not destined to disappear.
They are living creatures and pushed by existence from existence to identify their ability to adaptacy that will be beyond their ability to adaptation.
And I'm going to be disbodishing in the pathric of Penans.
a popular None's in the Sarawak, in the so-called the Cinese Once who lived in the forest, and now reduced to the life-based fillers in the rivers of the rivers of the river, where you can see the rivers from the lim that seems to be on the Cinese Meridiond, where the navi is the Cinese Meridiond, where you can see the navi the Japanese fall the lim of the navison,
It takes the subject with the subtrack.
Or, in the case of the Yanomami, are the diseases that are coming to the discovery of the gold.
If we move on on the Tibet, where I'm doing a lot of research, you see the hard of political domination.
As you know, the genocide -- the extreme extension of a popular level, but the ethnogic of the population, but the destruction of a popular population, not only is convicted -- but celebrated in certain environments, because it makes part of development.
And you can't understand the suffering of the Tibet until you start to the beginning.
I lose the 6,000 miles from Chengaging through the Tibet through Tibet Tibet with a young colleague, but only came to Lhasa young colleague, but only came to Lhasa statistics that we feel like to talk about.
6,000 monures wridding the poles and energy.
1.2 million people killed by military military in the Cultural Rivolution
The father of this guy was assumed to the Panchen Lama.
The one that means that it was killed to be killed at the time of the Chinese invasion of the Chinese invasion --
He's out of the Santity during the diaspora that has taken the population in Nepppal in Nepppal.
His mother was imprisoned and his colpin was being rick.
It was brought to the age of two years from the age of two years from the bird because it could live without him.
The sister that he did this -- it was actually put it in the field field in the field field.
One day has been sat a day a fashion the Mao and the transgression, it was put it in the transgression, it was put it to seven years.
The Tibet can be inable, but the spirit of the population is to keep present.
And then it turns out, all you reduce a choice.
We want to live in the world of the monocromatic of the world of different the policy world of diversity?
The great antropolog ancropolog called the biggest fear was said that his biggest fear was that, in our way to this vision of the world, not only we'll see the whole legal leg, we don't only see the legal leg, but a day we get us from a none dimental deliver, but a day we get us from a dimentict snone dimental deliver.
And it's humiliate to remember that our species is existed for 600,000 years.
The Neolitic Riution that has given us to us to be able to switch in the seed-fighting the poem of the seed-based with the clamn of the classassroom with the cloud of the specialization, and we talk about 10,000 years ago.
The modern world industrialized to stand 300 years.
That sharks me that we have the response to me that we have the answers to all the challenges that we have to deal with a thousand to come.
When these miles of cultures of the world is asked what to say to be human, they respond to 10,000 different voices.
And it's in these answers that we all risk that we all sleep, a kind of conscious things that have to make all the population and all the gives are the gardens can fire themselves. And there are great moments of optimism.
I took this picture on the north of Baffin, when I went to the Baffin, when I went to the whales with the Inuit and this man, Olaya, he told the wonderful story of his grandfather.
The dog government was not always gentlemen with the Inuit and the '50s for our own subject our sound, we have given them in colonies.
The grandfather of this man refused to go into the way.
The family for his life, he took all the arms, and all of his attaction and all of his attack.
You have to know that the Inuit don't temes the free, they exploited.
The slits of the slits were made of fishing pairs were made of fish.
The grandfather of this man did not put from the night or night or the baths that suffering in the basis that suffering out.
It's sleeped by the way, you calculated pantalons in their own hand. When the paper and defected in their hand. When the 10 are congelated, their creating lam.
He salive on the points of this key glass and when I became solid -- killed a dog -- killed a dog --
He brought the dog and created a bribe, with the glass cassroom brought another glass cover a slittle, and it has disappears on the banking, and it has disappeared on the walls of the wild in the rest.
We want to talk about horse? [Risthe] And this in different ways, and this in different ways, is the symboly of the Inuit and all the Indian population of the Inuit and all the Indian population of the world.
In the 1999, the government government canadese has rejected to Inuit in the Inuit and Texas a bigger territorial and Texas mand Texas mitted together.
It's their new pathria. It's called Nunavut.
It's an independent territory of the minerary resources.
One of the unclay of as a national as a national national to reconcilit with his population.
And, finally, I think it's pretty obvious about the who we had been in these remote areas of the planet, I realized that are not active act.
It's home.
They represents of human imagination that are slow-up of the temples. And for us everybody, like the swoods of our children, as the swisdom of hope.
And we finally fine, we have National Geographic we are convince that politicians will never come to anything.
We believe that polemicy --
[Applausive, but we believe that stories can change the world, and maybe we have the best institution, and maybe we're the best institution, to tell stories of the world. Every month our website is 35 million visites.
156 countries transmit our television can.
Our magazine are reading from millions of people.
Our work is traveling in the ethnox-to-hold in places of which are going to be able to be bears from which they will be hold as they saw it, they will be hold central releasing the central remain in the diversity of the antiropologi: the world to be a pluralistic plurstypticultural and multicultural multicultural in the world
where the wisdom of all the populations can contribute to our well-being collective.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope to call other than other than you already heard and evidence of the connections, in case you don't notice that you don't notice them.
I want to start with what I call the official dog's officer dog's officer.
The official dog's office?
The official dog's officer of all the industrial societies the officer officer officer -- "If we want to multimately, the well-being our cities." "The way to do is to male the individual freedodog's offic."
The reason is to be a late, in the fact that freedom is in itself a value, is preted, as useful for human beings.
And the other is the fact that if we are free, each of us can active to do everything that massive our benefit without any decide in the name of our well-like in name.
The way to massize, the freedom is to massize.
More people people are free, more free, and more freedom is their freedom, more freedom is their well-being.
This is so deep in the society that nobody would have dream to put it in a doubt in the society that nobody would have dream to put it in a doubt.
And it's also deep in our vices.
I'll show you some examples of what progress has repossible.
This is my supermarket. It's not particularly big.
I lost a simple note on conditional conditional conditional conditions.
In my supermarket there are 175 conditions, without content the 10 variety of olive olive and the 12 balloon whales that you can buy you for a huge amount of conditional conditional constent number of constance that nobody of 175 ready ready you are gradiment.
That's what the supermarket.
Then you go to the electronic stand to buy a stere: cassroom, reader, reader, reader, reader, legs -- the legs -- the present legs.
And in this single single electric store, there's a big audio components.
We can do six million different combinations using the components that there are in a negotial.
You have to put that there is a lot of choice.
Other field: the world of communications.
One time, when I was a child, you could get all the services, to get all the services, to pat that were forming from mamma Bell.
He was born the phone is not buying it.
One consequence of that, in the other, it was that telephone is not a make.
These days are gone.
Now we have a variety of telephone of telephone cell phone cellular phones, especially between cellular cells.
Here's the future.
My favorite is that in a half a MP3, cuts of the bird of the bird and forward crushing for the Brut.
If you wouldn't have seen it in the store, you're pretty much certain that will be below certain that will be going to get there.
And what the end is that people in the negods and this question and said, "No."
You can't buy a cellular cellular that doesn't do too many things.
So, in other aspects of life that are much more important than the watch; it means the same explosion of choices.
health -- health -- not happens, it's not going to be in the United States that you walk from doctors and the doctors what you have to do.
Instead, you walk from the doctor, and the doctor, "OK, we could do A, or B, "Hey, you have these well-skills and these risk." "By these s," "By you want to do that?"
You say, "Dots, what would I do to do that?"
And the doctor says, "In these benefits and the risk of these risks, and Bs has these skills and these risk."
"What do you want to do that?"
And you reback, "Dottore if she was me, what to do that?"
And the doctor: "But I'm not leito me."
The result of the malator we call the malato," expression that seems to do it seems to do it seem to be a good thing.
But actually it's not a sent to move the fish, and the responsibility of decisions from somebody who knows something, which is the doctor, to somewhere it doesn't know -- and almost certainly is maled -- and so not in the ideal condition, to make the wheat the other people who knows how to make the equality for the patient.
There's a huge marketing of pharmaceutical, direct people like me and you, if you think it's not sensis, you think that we can't buy them.
But if we can't buy them, why do you have the public them, why do you do that?
The answer is that they want to domous, we call the doctor to ask ourselves to change the reject.
So what is so fundamental as it is our identity is a question of choice, like you see in this vignity. We don't want to force the children. We don't want to force the right moment of the right time. We don't want to be a longer in the right moment -- we have to invent.
And we can reinvention us how many times we get us to reinvention us.
The means that every morning, at the risky, you have to decide that kind of person wants to be.
But in the family and the matrimonize, a time the perspective, it was almost everybody, it was smarted to the most prestacking as much as possible, and it was going to make the most previous possible.
The only green was with chemistry was with chemistry, and even what to do later.
Over day, it's really really to play to play.
I mean, at a very smart students, and I do their 20 percent of work in less of work than a time.
And because they're less to be brilliant, not because they are less diliges.
But why are you implement, I mean, do I should marries or now? I should I do this now?
"Would I marries later? I thought before the children or careerad?
They are interrogatives now.
And they try to answer these questions, even if this implement doesn't completing the companies that you don't have a good vote to my exam.
And they need to do that. I'm really important questions.
Now, the job: we're lucky, like Carl subolineavy because technology allows us to work every day, from every day, from every day, from the planet, except from the Hotel Randph.
And in the parents, there's a corner and I won't tell anyone where the WiFi works.
I don't say that, because I want to use it.
What means, this incredible freedom of choice that we have to be continually decided, and continually in every moment, if we have to work or not.
We can go to see our boy playing to calculci, with the cellular cellular in the other, and the notebook in the other, and the notever.
And even if they're all sorts of the spins, every minute we see our boy road, "Do I have to answer this -- I need to answer this thing?"
"Do I have to answer this email? I have to abboundboy this letter on?"
And even when the answer is "no," all of this makes the title experience.
So, from any part of the look, things and small and big, things and stildy, life is a question of choice.
Once the world was this: Ovver, there were some possibilities, but it wasn't a choose of choice.
The world today is a little bit like this: The dilemma is, "Is it a positive thing, or negative thing you know, or negative about?"
The answer is Sunc.
The positive lightens we all know -- so I'm going to talk about the negative of the negative lies.
All this choice behaviors on two negative effects on the people.
The prison, paradox, is that producing paralysis instead of freation.
With options between the fairs that choooose becomes very hard to do that.
I give you a meaning example -- a conducted on the plans of flight-flying platos.
A colleagues had access to the data from Vanguard, the gigantesis of the deep society with about a million clients, with about a different clients in 2,000 companies.
What she found is that for every 10 solutions that are offered in the more, the percentage of flow-scale air-scale air.
With 50 sources, there's 10 percent of less of adeaths when they're available to only 5. Why?
Because with 50 sources of the flows that chooood, is maledetail, and choice is remaintains.
And I still ask questions, and I wonder, questions, and of course, the questions don't get it.
You know that not only means that these old jobs from the old people to keep food for can, because they don't want to say that decision is so obststicle founds of the worker of the dator worker of the job.
They are not participating them until 5000-dollar data, which would be losing to the data, which would be well displaced to sit them.
So the paralysign is a consequence of having too much choices.
And I think it makes the world like that.
"And finally, for the ethchup, or a mainernition, or mainessels or maine?"
You just want to take the right decision -- if it's for ethokay.
You don't want to choose the wrong fund to choose the wrong condition to the wrong.
So this is the first effect is that even if we can avoid paralysis, and make a choice, we are less soddisappeared by how you would we were with less options between the unless options between which you choose it.
And this for different reasons.
One of these is that with a lot of conditions that you choose to you buy one and it's not perfect, it's easy to imagine that you could do a different choice. And what happens is that you could have been better than the alternative imagined us by the alternative imagined us by the choice, and the rempit reaction sod's reaction of the decision of the decision that is the defad-up to the decision that you could do a different choice.
even when it was a good decision.
More choices are easy to be easy to any detail that is unsodly unddisfacing of choice.
But as the economists call it cost-expensive opportunity.
DGilbert has to very well stamattine as the values that we give the values to things that we depends on what we do with it.
Del rest, when there are many options that you can make the features, is easy to represent the alternative characteristic and being less soddisconnected to the option of option that you have choice.
Here's an example. I get all the ones that are not in New York.
But it's what you probably think about it.
There's this copy to Hamptons.
A place of the luse.
Spivacy plendid. Oty day. It's all about them.
Not anything. But what he thinks is -- "Well, maledibling."
"All my neighbors in Manhattan are alive."
"I could just talk about the right of the front of home."
And she spent two weeks with the idea that is losing -- every day -- the chance of parking where you want.
The expensive opportunity to the soddisphation for what we have, even when the choice was excellent excellent.
And the more of the options that we have to consider it, more the characteristics are going to come up against how cost-opportunity.
Here's another example.
This is a lot of things.
It's about the living the moment, and maybe the live slowly.
But the most important point is that anything you choose to you choose to not do the other.
The things that we don't choose have a lot of attractive attractive what we do.
Third point, spiral growing of waiting for expectancy.
I tried to the skin, buy a new jeans.
Jeans.
Once the jeans were just a type of a type of them and would, they were smoke, only after having them a life and work a lot of times, starting to go well.
So, I went to buy a couple new when the old people were gone, and I said, "You need a couple of jeans, this is my cut.
The committed told me "Look fit, tit, tit, folks and fit, relaxed that?"
You want to the cernier or with the bottonies? "Stonehed," or "acid."
"Do you want the road of that?"
"Would you want to be cut, or close to the blah -- he was going to bit.
I was skid, and after a little bit of the jean I said, "I want the kind of like -- that was the only one guy who was a little bit of what it was so for one of the negotitia, and then you get out of the negotitia, with the best negotia, with the best of the negotial jeans that I ever had happen.
It was the mmoud. With all that choice.
But I felt worse.
Why? I wrote a book to understand that.
The reason I was worse is that with all that choice was that with all the choice were expectations -- the jeans had to be perfective.
I was expectations of minim. I didn't expect to nothing about exceptions, when he saw 100 different places, at least a different kind of had to be perfect.
What I had watched was good -- but not perfect --
After I had paragoned to what I was trying to be insoddisded in confronted to waite.
The addition of the options of the people don't make it increasing the expectations of the options of the options itself.
And this will be less soddisfation, even when the results are good at it.
None in the world of marketing if it makes it content.
Because if I know that, you wouldn't know what I'm talking about.
The truth looks like that.
"You were better when you were worse above the most of the time was worse is when you were worse to it was even possible to meet it was even possible to meet the pleasure of pleasure --
Over the world we live -- the world we live -- opululent citizens with the perspective, the mouthy that we can hope is that things are to be at the timeal ality.
You never have to be surprise to because your expectancy, my expectancy, my expectancy --
The secret of happiness -- what you're here -- is "Basitle." "Yes, you want."
I mean, little -- I mean, a little bit of a cartoonic moment -- which are really sposited and it's really stupendy.
I couldn't do better, I didn't do a little bit of it.
But account is not always a bad thing.
And finally, a consequence of the buying a couple of jeans wheel when you have only that jeans are that when you're not satis; you ask you Why?
"Who is responsible to that?
The world is responsible. What could I do about that?
When there are hundreds of jeans, and you buy a insoddisface, and you ask you who is responsible to you, is the responsible for you are responsible to you.
You could do better.
With hundreds of variety available -- there are no excuse for insuccess.
So when people get decisions, even if the result is valize, they feel unsoddisded, and they give the skin.
In the last few years the depression is exploded in the industrialization.
I think a significant factor -- not the unique, but important -- of this wave of the depression is just that people have deludent experiences because the standard are too alone.
And when they need to explain this situation that the color is them.
So the final result is that in general we're general, objectively, but we feel worse.
Let me tell you about that.
This is the official dog's offical, what we all take for good and it's completely false.
There's no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than that doesn't have to have any hardly choice that much choice is better than a little bit of a little bit.
There's a critical value, magic value.
But I'm sure we have beat from a piece of the level where the choices improvement our life.
Now, from political point -- I almost ended -- from the policiician, the nock of political view, the nock is follow.
What it allows all this choice in the industrial society is the rich material.
There are many places in the world, and you know about that, where the problem is not that they have too many choices.
The problem is that have too few of it.
So the factory that I'm talking about is a mal, of modern modern the modern of modern society in the Western society in the Western societies
And what makes you depress and angry is this: Steve Levitt you know, how the costs and seats seats are useful for bibes are inutiable.
I mean, these complicated choices, complicated and dispended on is not simple.
They are really delets to be deletered.
They make worse worse.
If a little bit of what in our societies allows to pick up in those where people have too much of the people have too much poor it would be only their life to be better than the nostrength.
This is what economists call a paretyan improve improvement
A redistribution redistribution.
To conclud: "Fook, you can become all that you want,
Voick, people of culture, think about what makes that fishery that fisher?"
"It's obvious that you can't make anything in a mouse of wetrote w."
"From imagination fall-up vision vision of the world."
and I interpreted it like this, at the beginning.
But then, I think about it, I got up, I realized that the fish fish.
Because the reality of the reality of the reality of the mous, so that you can get freedom in the way that you can't get freedom.
If you rose your mouse so that all you can be decrediminual with the satisfation.
Accepty the paralysis, and you get the well-being.
Everybody needs a stop.
This is almost certainly too stretch, maybe even for the fish, and because of us.
But the absence of some symbolic symbolic symbolic symbolic symbols.
Thank you very much.
