And the last year I showed these slides to show that the calculation that the type for almost three million years has had the size of 48 million years has had the size of 40 percent.
But this is a lot of this subvalitted the gravity of the problem because it doesn't show the ice of ice --
The art glacial cleaning is in a sense, the heart of the global climate system.
You get it out of the winter and the summer.
The next slide is going to be a rapid carlled on the last 25 years.
The game, lost lost of reputs are drawed in red it.
As you see, they expand blue to blue you.
That's the ice in the winter winter, which is running back to the summer.
You can see that the game glacious glacious glacious game, is like the blood -- which is out of the body.
In 25 years was going to go like this, at this time.
This is a problem because the climate that you are in the art that the art of arctic where there are huge amount of carbon that the arctic amount of carbon foot -- and they get transformed by microbis.
Rememployees of the totality of the atmospheric pollution, that amount could double, that four of the totality might be back.
In some laghi deep-deep-deep-hand is already releasing from water.
The professors Katey Walter University of Alaska has made with a team at a team at a fast team at the bottom of the U.S.
Video: Wow! All Gore: Wow! All right. The question is if we would.
A reason is that this exchange that the house surrises the Greenland from the north.
This is a ririver.

These corrups are increasing rapidly.
Another part of the planet: Antarctica, the largest ice of the planet.
The last month, the scientists have declared that the balance of ice is in negative, and that the West Western Hout, Twents of some under islands, is particularly rapid in the sheffort in the sheet.

The disasters are increasing a retents out of the normal and without precedent.
Four times more number in the last 30 years of respect to previous previous to previous about 75.
This is a whole game.
If you look at it in historical context if you can see the consequences.
In the last five years we added 70 million tons of CO2 hours -- 25 million tons in the oceans every day.
Look at the top of the oriental Pacific Pacified America, to the west, and west, and in the west, where a radical impositional of oxygen in the oceans.
The greater than global warming, together the deforestation, which is 20 percent, is the using of the fossil fuel use of fossil fuel uses.
The oil is a problem, and the carbon is even worse than worse.
The United States are one of the most hemissions, together with the most emissions, together to China.
And it proposed to build a lot of other carbon disease.
But we're seeing a change.
These are the annual projects in the last few years and some realternative proposes.
All the way there is a political lotta in our country.
The carbon and oil industries have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote the carbon to promote charcoal --
And this picture reement me reminded me reminded me --
Natmal in Tennessee, where I live in the Tennessee, where there was 3.8 billion gers.
You may be seen it on the news of news.
This is the second largest flow of scories in America.
It's happened around Natmaker.
The natalizing of one of the carbon industries was this thing.
Video: Man: The Prosty carbonononon is a float and happy.
It's dealing here in America, and it makes our economy.
Frosty carbon is increasingly clean.
It's a good piece of price, and workers are keeping the stypendent stypend.
Al Gore: From here is a lot of the West Virginia.
The largest society minerary society on mountains is Massey Coal. This is his administrator.
Video: Don Blankhenship: I'm going to have to clear -- Al Gore, Nancy Pelow, Harry Reid -- they don't know what they're talking about.
Al Gore: So the Allance for the Proteaming of Clima launched two campaigns.
This is one of it.
Video: All right, "At COALery see the changes as a matter services like a threat at our business.
So our priority is to invest a great amount of money in a public effort to make public and confused the charcoal.
In fact, the carbon is not spore.
We think it's cleaned -- it also has a good properly.
So not predictateful for climate change.
Let me do to us.
Video: All right, "Clean cleaning -- you heard a lot of it.
So let's take a gyp structure at a framework for how carbon disease.
Straordinarily machines are a little noisy tools, but this is the sound of the carbon technology.
The carbon consumption, the main causes of global warming, but the night technology of charcoal technology that you see changes everything.
Take a look at the carbon technology.
Al Gore: Finally, the positive alternative and connect to economic and economic safety.
Video: Comment: The America, is in the economy, economy, the national security climatics.
The filter that colleagues all of the physicians and the fossil fuel and the fossil fuel and the imported oil.
Now, there's a new audition to use it.
But, America, 100th percent of clean energy, 100th years.
They plan to stop the work, to make America to work out and help us to stop global warming.
Finally, a solution that you have to solve our problems.
Repower America. You buy more.
Al Gore: This is the last time.
Video: Comment: It's about reducing energy.
One of the fastest ways to bring the dependence on the combustible combines that kills our planet.
All right, "The future is here. Vent, only a new web network.
She knows that we have 2: Noves investments for places to work well.
Christ: Repower America. It's time to be realist.
Al Gore: A old African old proverble-ft, you go to it.
If you want to go away together."
We have to go away quickly.
Thank you very much.
The last year at TED fect at TED fect LHC.
And I promise to go back to the way to get back to how the machine.
So here I got here. And for those who are not there -- the other time they didn't have the most of scientific experiment scientific experiment -- 27 miles of miles of circus here.
His compit is to reach the conditions that were less than a billion second from the beginning of the universe -- until the beginning of the universe -- until to second.
This is just environment.
This is the underneath Ginevra machine.
We photographs Bang Bang Bang Bang inside the relawers.
This is what I work. It's called ATLAS -- is largeon -- it's a 44 feet and has a 22 feet of feet --
This is a spectacular image of ATLAS in building so you can see proportions.
The 10 ses of the last year, we have access the machine for the first time.
And this picture was taken by ATLAS.
It was causes of immenses in control.
It's a picture of the first particles that had done all the way around the LHC, entering into collision, and deliberately with a part of LHC, and spreading particles inside the relauns in the relaunching in the relaunds of the first particles in the relayer.
In other words, when we saw that image the 10 ses we understand that the machine working, the machine, which is a great liftype of the machine.
I don't know if it was to exult us more opposed to do this, when somebody on Google and saw that the page was this thing.
That means we had a cultural impact that scientific impact to the scientific
About a week later, there was a problem with the machine, had to be a slightly in these files -- these dorates of dorates.
These films bring 13,000 prints when the machine works at the most power.
Now, technical technicians between you and say, "It's not true. They're not true. They're films too underly.
And they can do it because when they're very cosids, they become the soft soft movie become to the superconvictors.
So, at less 271 degrees, to a nurture temperature to the space of the stars, these files can bring that corrupt that rent.
In one of the most of the most of the news of the most of the half of the fabrication of fabrication of fabrication.
So the files surrounded up and 13,000 prints suddenly met a resistance of electric.
This was the result.
Now, this is even more impressive if you think these magnets are over 20 tons, and that got moved over about 30 centimeters, and that got been moved about 30 centimeters.
They're damamaged about 50 magnets.
We had to take it to you down, what we did it.
We have repristine and travels.
They're now now now they're back to their place underground.
English the end of LHC is going to be new integral new integras.
We let it all the way and we expect to get the data or slump or light. And we go to discover what the universe.
Now, of course, in a certain quite way. these accidents reaccept the debate of science and engineering. It's effort to confuture.
I think that the fact that is so difficult to go beyond the limits, I think this is the value of things like LHC.
I would like to conclude with a scientist Ingless, Humphrey Davy, what, Humphreyses; in defense of inuseful inuseful for progress of its own mind as a device, he said, "No it is a dangerous as much as much as the ideas the reality of the human mind as the reality of the mind as the define as the deal with nature, and there are no longer being."
Thank you.
I want to start asking you to think about this here, as a children, playing with the children, playing cool matter with the morning.
And as you realize how to realize them and realized them, take and learn, and learn about thinking and resolve problems and resolve problems and manipulating and handing relationships.
The space is deeply connected to the way we understand a lot of the world around us.
So, as information inspired by using from the uses of our physics, with my physics, and my consultent and my collaboratory and my collaboratory collaboratory and I started asked, "And if we use a computer, instead of having the handless of the polastreser as a polastrelief as a drug, we could deal with an information with both information with both physically information with both information with both relies
and to our please?
The question was so interesting that we decided we decided we decided we making the answers, building the Siftable.
In words, a few words, a Siftable computer interactive computer biscoe.
In words, a few words, a Siftable computer interactive computer biscoe.
You can move them with the hand, they can see ""Okay, to feel their movement and they have a wireless.
But more physics, as physics, like physics, as physics, you can just move it.
The Siftable example of a new ecosystem of tools to manipulate the digital information.
And as they become more physics, and as physics, and as we motion, and as they get more physics, and as they get more physics, and as we motion, and the other stils of the motions, of the interaction.
I'm going to start with some simple examples.
This Siftable is configured to show video -- if you including it in a direction, the video will go back to the other side back.
These interactive riticians are aware of the other people.
If I rely dealing them in what they are interested in the time.
If they come surrounded and they can agree a bunch of it.
If they come surrounded and they can agree a bunch of it.
They also green their movement and incline.
We then realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was to use the common on data, for example, "Tvers" -- a color as if it was a liquid.
In this case, we have three Siftable configurated as secks of green and I can use them to use them to the color in the central central central in the central central central central central in the central central central of the central central in this case, where they mix and I can use them to use them to use them to use them to use them to use them to use them to use them to use them
and I can use them to use them to use them to the central color, where they mix mix the mix of the central set.
If we actually actually can release a little bit about place.
There's also beautiful chance of learning, like languages, like the mathematics and logical gical games where people can try things quickly and see the resultype and see the immediately.
Now I'm going to --
This is a sequence of Fibonacus that I do with a program of equations.
This is a game of words that is half between Scarabeo and Boggle.
Acratically, to every turn I get a letter to every Siftable, in every turn Siftable, you get a house on every turn Siftable, and as you try to get words of words to control words of a dictionary.
Then, after about 30 seconds are shucking, and you have a new set of lectures and new chance to try and nothing to try to do.
Thank you.
Here's a little bit of the kids came to the Middle Lab, I did that and I tried them and I got a video.
They are pleased a lot of them.
And one of the interesting things that kind of application is that you don't have to give people a lot of education.
You have to just say, "Looks," and they know exactly what to do.
Here's what other people who tried it.
This is our most given bete, younger lad, there on the right.
It actually wanted to be a large cluster.
They were just a morning,
Now, this is a application of a interactive carton.
We wanted to build a tool, the learning of the English Lui is Felix.
It can put new characters, soil, supplied the sify and their Siftable their associated
It can put new characters, soil, supplied the sify and their Siftable their associated
So, it's doing the sun.
Video: The sun, the sun is smigene.
David Merrill: World World took a treat the scene.
Video: The treater.
Bel work!
So schooling the Siftable and put them up neighbors can interact the characters --
Video: Bau!
-- inventing your story.
Video: Hell!
DM: It's a story with open final and it can decide as a flight.
DM: It's a story with open final and it can decide as a flight.
Video: Video: Video:
DM: The last example I have time to show you is a tool, recently recently, to sample, and to execk music.
it's a tool, recently, to sample and to sample and to music.
The Siftable here are playing from sound like like the base and bacteria.
Each of these has four different variations, and you can choose what use.
You can insert these sounds in a sequence to be to coming out of your floor.
And it modificate it simply doing a sound and a "sequence."
These are effects that you can control of living, like the reverse and the filter.
You attacks to a particular sound and then including it to add it.
And then there are general effects as time and volumes that apply into sequence.
We look at how it works.
Video: DM: We're going to start a base in two Seft," "sequence" -- we get to a series, we get to a series, the extend to be add more base.
Now I put a lower of a low.
Video: DM: Oh, add of the top of ussions --
Video: DM: And I'm going to put the filter to the bacteria, so I can control the effect of live.
Video: I know a fast sequence the whole sequence of time from a side or one side of the time at one or the other hand,
Video: DM: And I'm going to add the low-up to give more expression.
Video: I can recombining the sequence of the sequence to the face of the volo."
So I didn't have to planning it before, but I can try it to make it more longer or more corrupty.
And now, finally, I can get the whole sequence inclining the whole sequence inclining the Siftable "volume."
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is building new interface, new interfaces of the world's brain working, how our brain and body.
And today, I had time to show you one of the results of this peror, and some possibilities that we try to bring out of the lab.
The concept I want to transmit you is that new generation of objects to interact with digital media designer to interact with the media that we want.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the time to talk to all of you.
They're a writing writing.
To be a books is my professional and it's more than that, of course,
It's also love and the fasthrows of my life.
And I don't expect that can change it.
But you know, particular this one happened to my life and career in my life and career, which leading me to realibrate the whole realm of this work.
The particular thing is that I recently written this book, this biography called "Mangia, Prega, Ama," what I mean, my books, for some reason for the world and he got a big thing, and it became a big thing, interactional sensational, interactional bestseller interaction.
And the result is that everywherever away from now, people have to me as if I was convicted to me.
By -- convicty convict!
They come from me to me now everybody worried and said, "You don't afraid you can't afraid more to do it?
You don't afraid to continue to write for all life without any longer to be able to create a book that can importing somebody?"
that can importing somebody?"
It's reasically, you know.
But it could go worse, I was a part of that I remember 20 years ago, when I was a lot of people -- I was an adolescent -- I was an adolescent -- I wanted to be a ritical scene.
I would meet it reverse the same based by fear.
And people said, "Don't do you get a successful time to be success?
You don't afraid that the humpe of the refitt you?
You don't afraid to do this mester mester all of life without any swimming on a cumulation of dress and die of a shot skets with the mouth of falliments?"
Things like this, you know.
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is, "Y."
I have to be further of all those things.
I always had a fear.
And I also fear of a lot of other things that people might not have to mean
As a and other things -- and other things --
But as I think about the writing what I thought and ask me really wonderful is why is?
Is it do?
And it's logical that anyone who needs to be scared by a work that I feel to be sent to do it.
But what is that particular in the impresequence creative to make us about mental health mental health mental health of the mental health manage?
How my father, for example, he was a chemical engineer and not remember one time in his 40 years of activities where he was asked if he had to be to be engineer if he had to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer?
There was never -- that block of John, like this?
It didn't work, anything that work?
Enestly, chemical engineers as group don't have certainly in centuries, gued the reputation of being alcohyacks.
We writers, we have enough this reputation, and not only as writers but creative of all generation, we have this reputation of being enormously instable.
And it doesn't rest that look at the context of the death of the magnific creative minds that only creative in the 2th century, and they were young and often for hand.
And the ones that they don't have suicidata seem to be actually disddone by their womans.
Norman Mailer, before in the last interview said, "Or my book me a little bit more book me a little more than it was killed a little more deal with the work of their life.
But we don't have to be able when we heard this because we heard these things that are so long, we somehow we have interior relief and accepted the notion and suffering that the creativity and the end, it always will always run to the anguguy.
And the question I want to ask all of this today is, are you agree with this idea?
You go to this thing -- because also looks at it from a centimeter to me -- not good for anything that supposed to be good for anything that support --
I think it's hodouble.
And I think it's also dangerous and I don't want to see perpetuate in the next century.
I think it's better to encourage our big minds creative to live.
And I certainly know that in my case -- in my situation -- would be very dangerous to become out to that I could be a dark of supposion, broad, broad, the circumstances where I are in my career.
Of course of look, I'm quite a young, I have about 40 years.
I still have about four job decades in me.
And it's very likely anything that I would write in the time will be right now that I used by the world as a job after the work that was used by the work that after the last book.
I'm going to be sket, because we're all more or friends here -- it's likely my greatest success is to my greatest success is to my should.
Oh, Gesus, that thought.
You know this is the kind of thinking that brings a person to start to drink nine and I don't want to do it.
I would continue to do this work that I love to do this work that we are.
So, the question becomes like, what?
And so it seeds me after a lot of reflections, that the way to work is to create a psychological psychological construction to create a psychological construction -- right?
I have to find a security of safety between me, which I am write, and my natural anks that I am written the population of that written the population of the models on how to do it through time, trying to find other societies to see if they could have some other societies to see if they could have some other societies to have ideas and healthier and healthy to see if they could have the best ideas and healthy as and healthy as and healthy as and I was going to have to get it to see if they could
how to help people creative people to manage to manage emotional inerents of creative creativity.
And that researching me to the ancient Grecia and ancient Roma.
You follow me because it turns out to go back and then back back and then comes back.
In the ancient Grecia and ancient Rome -- people didn't seem to believe that the creativity came from man, OK?
And it was thinking that creativity is that the wind and came to the wind and selled some surface, and unknown, for the reasons and unknown reasons and unknown.
The Greeks called these spirits of the demons of creativity "demons."
Socrate, wonderful, he believed to have a demon that elargiving wisdom by away.
Romans were of the same idea, but they called the spirit of spirit without a genius.
Which is great about that -- because the Romans didn't really think that a genius was somebody particularly smart.
They believe that a genius is this kind of entity of the inner that created living in the walls of an artist, a little bit like the Dobby, and that came out of the Dobby, and that came out of the non-cost and modeling the around, and modeling the result of that work.
Exectional -- this is the distance of which I talk about -- that psychological psychological that protects you from your work.
And everybody knew that was so that it was that working, right?
So the antic artists were protected by certain things, like the too narcism, right?
If your work was exceptional is not you could take it all over the market, everybody knew that they all knew that I was helped by this incourage.
If your fallabor, it wasn't all of your fail, right?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be a slightly hunge.
And so people have conceived the creativity in Occident for a long time.
And then the Rinaciment, and all changed and all of this great idea; we put the human being in the center of the universe and let the hands and no longer and leaves and no longer and leaving and left space to the divinity.
This was the principle of the rational human exaction, and people started to think that the creativity came from the issue of the issue of the issue of the issue of the issue.
And for the first time in history, it began to reference or that artist as a rather than a genius with genius.
And I have to tell you, I think that was a big mistake of mistay.
I think that allowing somebody, a simple person to believe that being like a recipy as the source, and the surgery of all the mysteries and recognition and etherns is a film too large to psychology to be a film to be a too to be a fragile human accountability to be a phrase.
It's like to ask someone to engineer the sun
Deform and completely the ego and creates all these ingestible ingestizing aspectations on the performance.
And I think this was a pressure to destroy the artists in the past.
And if this is true, and I think that is, and I think that question, and now?
Can we do it differently?
You think more ancient understanding of the more understanding of the relationship between humans and creative creative and mystery creative understanding of the relationship between humans and mystery and creative mystery.
Or maybe no.
Maybe we can't cell about 500 years of rational thinking in a 18 minutes.
And there is probably people in the audience that would be suspects of scientific notion of the notion of the notion of the notion of the device, and you make people in their projects.
I'm going to probably not convince you all about this thing.
But the question I would like to ask is -- why we know?
Why don't think it in this way?
Because it has more sense of any other thing that ever ever heard to explain the impredictability of creative process.
One process of that, as anyone who has ever tried to do something -- so fundamentally, everybody here -- yet you don't get rationally.
And, in fact, in fact, it can seems completely paranormal.
I did this meeting recently with the recently poeter Ruth Stone, who has now 90 years old, but that was a poeter for all life and said that during his childhood in Virginia, working out in the rural Virginia, and I heard it was from when a poemed poem, and I heard the poemed to be in the landscape.
He told me that it was like a fragorous trenough of air.
And he came rolling towards from the landscape.
It was to get it to get the land under your feet.
He knew that to have one thing to do to that point and he was like, "run to run as a morn."
And so it was going to be moving to and it was following from this poem, and it wouldn't have to make a piece of paper and and a pretty much fastic paper.
Sometimes couldn't be quicked, and it was run, and it was running and run without getting home and the poems the rolled and poems the rolled and she was going through the landscape, and she would continue to roll through the landscape, "He's another poet."
And then there were those times -- this piece never forget it -- there were a moment that was almost losing the time that was almost losting in almost losing --
So, he was running at home and was looking for the paper, and the poetry was through a naked right through the while he was going to go and then he was like, and then he said, he was like to hold with the other hand and the enffee off.
And he got the poems from the coda and the reputting it in his body and transanscale on the page.
And in these cases, the poems would be presented on the perfect and intact the last one of the last word to the first one to the first first before.
So when I heard that -- it's crazy exactly the same as I feel as I felt at my creative process.
Not all my creative process -- I'm not a convict!
I'm a mule, and my way to work is -- I wish up at the same hours every day and work and work and work and work and work and work and get it over the enough and to work and get it on the game.
But even I was a hyo in my minard-bad against that thing, sometimes against that thing, sometimes you.
And I imagine that many of you have a lot of you have it.
You know, even if the work and ideas and ideas and ideas would come from a certain foundly about.
And what is this thing?
And how can we relate to that we don't lose our head, but rather, rather, rather, that do we stay to stay to stay up in a way that we don't have to be sanight?
And I mean, the best example of the contemporary that I have is the Tom Waits, which I interviewed different years ago for a day.
We were talking about this, and you know, Tom, and you know, Tom, for the magician artist of the tormented contemporary artist of contemporary creative impulses to control these species of creative creative impulses.
But then he was taken up and a day and day as he was driving on a hailing at Los Angeles, changed everything for him.
He was going to fast and all of a tract that small fragment of this small fragment of melodia, which comes into his head as inspiration, and the want, you know, it's beautiful, and the want, you know, it's won't how to take it.
It has no piece of paper, it doesn't have a matter, it doesn't have a recorator.
So you start to feel this kind of old old old old old old old old old that you can grow up in the time-like to lose and hurt by this song.
I'm not quite good enough and I can't do it."
And instead of going to stop in the panic stopption.
And then I would have the whole process and made something completely new thing.
And he looked at the sky and said, "Scusa, you can't see that I'm driving I am it?"
"You seems that can write a song now?
If you really want to exist, you get back in a more opportunity when I can take care of you.
Other adments, you have to get somebody else today.
You go to the Leonard Cohen."
And his process changed after that.
Not the work, the work was still as a seedge.
But the process of the anthese, and the anks that was released when the genius came when the genius came to the genius that the other problems and free and then it was realizing it was realizing it was not to be an interioritory and recognized and returmented.
but well-culiaring wonderful bizarre collaboration a conversation between Tom and this strange thing and external thing that was lost was Tom.
So I felt that story began to change a little bit of a little bit of a time I was working and already saved a time.
This idea, saved when I was writing "Mangia, Pra, Ama," and I was in one of those caves of the disperation where we all have when we are working on something and we can't and start thinking that it will be a disaster, that that that will be the worst will be the worst book never writted.
Not only bad the worst written --
And I started to think about designing this project.
But then I remember from Tom who talked to and try to us to air and tried to us
So I stand up my face on the manus, and I direct my job at a pointing corner of a step corner.
And I told you about you, "You've got to know that if this book not be brilliant not be brilliant not be brilliant not be brilliant not be brilliant not be brilliant not be brilliant, right?
Because as I see I am put all of what I haven't more about that.
So if you want it is better and you have to press and do your party.
Okay. But if you don't do it, you know, it's cool.
I'm going to write the same because it's my work.
And I would like to do that I have to be recorded to me today I presented to my particular and so -- at the end is like this, and OK -- -- seule secourages the North and people were sacred to the moon, and sacred and sacred and sacross the movie and sacred and sacross the hours and to the high hours and to the high hours and to the high hours to the high and the hour.
And they were always magnific because the ballers, and they were fantastic and they were fantastic and they were fantastic.
But every one of them -- -- something happened, and one of these artists became in reality of them became to translent
And I know what I know about what I know that you saw everybody, a lot, a performance like that.
It was like the time stopped and the balleriny walking through a kind of landing and not being doing anything different from usual and it was not doing anything different from usual -- but everything else is flowing it.
And suddenly it doesn't just appears like a human human human is.
But you access from the behind and under in the divinity.
And when this happened, and people knew about the time, and people knew what was, they called him with his name.
They gave their hands and they were starting to singing, "Ah, God God, God, God, ."
That's God, you know.
And so the story -- when the Mors the south of Spay the south of Spay this habity, and they were going to change in the centuries of "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, who, you can still feel in the corner of the flow, which you can still feel in the flow,
In Spana, when a artist has made something impossible and magic and "Ah, ole, oh, oh, oh, bad," incomprehensible, and I -- a foot of God.
And it's great because we need.
But the problem comes up day day -- for the ballery ballery -- when you wake and found out that they are 11 morning, and the floor of Martedday and I have no longer mor.
It's just a death-death, and maybe it will never be able to ascut that you can never get to the height to that height up to that height up to the knee.
And maybe no one dog cancer the name of God even as well, and what so it has to do with the rest of his life?
It's difficult.
This is one of the most painful reconciliations to do in a creative life.
But maybe it doesn't have to be so angotiats if you can not believe -- that the most examtraordinary expects of your being coming from you to yourself.
But believe sts simply you give you a little bit of a squisite that squisite of this squisite of your life that you have to go to somebody else when you find.
And, you know, if we think think of it changes.
And so I started thinking about it, and it's surely as I thought for several months during the job working, the dangerous book that I'm going to public -- -- -- -- --
And what I have to continue when I feel electrack-recent -- not afraid --
Not just score.
He feel presenting you to presentate you for your parts, any of the parts, any can be.
If your work is ball, it's dance,
If the divine, you know, you can make a clip to leave some kind of wonderful to leave some kind of wonderful at a moment through your effort, then "Ole!"
Other and you get the same dance.
And "Ole!" to yourself.
I think I think I have to teach it.
"Ole!" to yourself, even for yourself, even for human love and testing talks to to always present you always always always always presented to be continuously.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
As you know I've talked about some of these projects on human genome genome of these projects on the new gene of genes.
Now we're going to start a new path -- we started to digitizing biology and now to start that code and now to start from that code code of biology, designing and synthesizing and synthesizing and synthesizing and synthesizing and synthesizing and synthesizing and now to start from that code the digit
We always tried to ask questions.
"What is life?" is something that many biological biological biological to understand various levels.
We tried different approach, reducing it to the minimum of terms.
We're digitalizing by almost 20 years hours.
When we sequenced the human genome was going to go from the analogical world of the digital world,
Now we ask us us to regenerate life, or create new life from this digital?
This is the map of a small organism organism -- the part, the part, the part, which is the smallest genome of those who can authoreplicate in the lab.
And we tried to reduce the genome to create a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of it.
We are able to eliminate a hundred genes of the about 500 that are here.
But when we look at his metabolic map, it's relatively easily respect to the noue.
You're saying me, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate to one at a time, is very unlikely that this can bring to a live.
So we decided that the only via to progress to progress this chromosome, so that we could could modify the components to ask the components.
And so we started wind the wind of "We can synthesize a chromoo?"
Can chemistry to make these big molecules that we never could create the golden before?
And, in case of business we can make a chromoom it?
A chromosome, is just a piece of chemical material inert.
The speed with which we are able to digitalizing life is growing up to exponential exponential to the
Our capacity to write the genetic code, pretty slowly, but it's better at it.
And our most results the results the brand to a exponential curve.
We started 15 years ago.
The process has been requires a lot of steps of steps before the early beginning to begin to be experiments.
But we found that synthesize DNA is very difficult.
There are decains of thousands of cars of machines in the world that produce small segments of DNA, the longer and it's a degenerative process -- the more errors is a long degeneration -- the more errors are there.
So we had to develop a new method to assembling these fragments and rors and rors to be rors.
And this was our first attempt from the digital information of the genome of Phi X 174.
It's a little virus, which kills kills batteries.
We designed the fragments, effects, effects, and I had a molecule, and I had a molecule.
The interesting part of this is when we took this piece of inert material and we put it into the bacteria and we had began to read this genetic code and producing virtual particles and producing virtual particles.
The virals are then released by cells, they were released by cells, and they found Ellects.
I talked about recently recent oilrowing oil, who are certainly understood that that they certainly understood this model.
They have more than you.
We believe that this is a situation where software can actually build its own hardware in a biological system.
But we wanted to do things more in bigger things.
We wanted to build the whole chromosome.
They're more than 580,000 letting genetic code of genetic code of genetic code.
So we thought we build it in cassets of the virus, so that we could change the cassets to understand what the components are the components of a living cell.
The design is crucial information is crucial, and if we start a computer, these are must be very accurate to be very accurate to be very accurate to be very accurate to be very accurated.
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 the accuratezing was a mistandard for every 10 thousand basis.
We found out of it, 30 errors. If we used that original sequence we had not been able to do it working.
And part of the process of the process of the reality of the report that you have to be able with all the other segments of 50 letters to build under-building subunits of the tiny works.
We try elements only here is one here.
You probably read that we read about the physical physical physical physical fill.
Think about that we have a genetic code genetic code on four letter: As and T.
Three of those reading together and code about 20 adminoacid adminoacid of letting for every adminoacid of letting for every adminoacid --
So we can use genetic code to write words, fraise thinking, though.
What we did in the beginning is automous to beginning to be automous
Some have been delused by that that it wasn't --
We have designed these segments to just just just to join with my own own things.
There are gencimes that repair them and they put them together.
And we started assembling the parts, starting with seven by five to seven miles of a letter to seven a letter way to form 24 miles of letter to get 72 miles literally to get 72 miles liters.
So every time we product these segments in abundance so that we can sequenct that we are trying to create a tremendous proceiving proception -- as you'll see in a minute.
We're trying to automatize the process.
So, this looks like the tabellon a basket.
When we get these segments, more than 100 thousand basis, more than 100 thousand basic and they will not grow more directly in E. them.
You get to the limits of modern tools of molecular biology.
So we considered other mechanisms.
We knew about another mechanism called omology, called omology, which is in biology to repair the DNA biology to repair segments.
Here's an example.
This organism -- called Deinococcus radiodurans, it can absorb three million radiation of radiation.
You can see in the high school require as his chromosome.
In 12 -- 24 hours is reassembled exactly as it was before.
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do that.
These organisms can be completely set up.
They can live below down.
They're absolutely certain that life exists in space, and you moved to find new environments.
As a true, NASA showed that this lives.
This is a picture of the molecule, which we built using these process, just using the boards, by using the board appropriate design appropriate to segments.
The lievidence them automatically
This image was not taken with a microscope, but with a microscope rular microscope.
It's a molecules that we can see it with a microscope.
These are pictures that cover a period of about six seconds.
This is the publishing that we did a little time ago.
They're more than 580,000 lettes of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code.
It's the greatest molecules of a defined structure ever created by man.
It has a molecular weight in a million hours at 300 million hones.
If we spend that you spend that 10 without spaces, you would like to have 142 pages to get this genetic code.
Now, how do we do it work? How can we active.
Of course, you can travel is a virus.
It's a little more complicated when you use the bacteria.
It's even easier when it's treating cells as wells as our eucarios as our re: you can simply extract the process of the clonation and put it up to a clonation process of clon.
In archaea the archaea is integrated inside the cell, but we recently have shown that we are able to do a cell phone that we are able to do a cell transplant from a cell and active it.
We can have a refalling from a microbial species of a microbial species.
The two are different as quite as men as well.
We added some genes in a little bit more power to decide what choice.
And it turns out to be slightly with the protectines.
And when we put it in the cells in the cells was stuff -- and you appreciate our softwo-sticatos -- the new romosome, the new cell romosome.
And we started thinking that we couldn't go beyond that, but we tried to drive us over there.
This is one of the major mechanisms of evolution.
We found that a lot of species have added a second or a third or a third of some parts, some of the hundreds of new trately,
So who thinks evolution as a only gene gene that modic is not a lot of the biology.
There's the gymes called restrial restriction of the restrial DNA.
The chromosome, that was in the cells that has no one of it.
The cell phone; the cromosomes that we have insert --
And it turns out and recognized the other chromosome, and it has masticked it with just the cell and we were only reached with the cell and new cromoom and the new cromoom and the new cromother and the new cromother as extract material,
has become blue to the genes that we insert.
And in a short lass of time, all the characteristics of a lost of gave and it turned into a new species, the new software ftware ftware swalked in the mobile phone.
All the proteins have changed, the membrans are changed, and when we read the genetic code of what we transfer code of what we transfer you transfer here.
Now, this might seem alchemiia but altering the software software as a software in fairly sustaining things in a fairly sustain.
Now, I've already explained that you don't talk about genesis -- but progress from three million years and a half evolution, and I said that maybe we are create a new version of the Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosion process new species that are going to digital process to digital process of this digital process of the degital process of evolutionary explosion of genesis that we have to be able to
Why do we do that?
I think it's enough of course when we think about our needs.
We're going to go from six billion and half of nine billion in the next 40 years.
I'm going to give you an example, I was born in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for each other existing existing in 1940 years, there are going to be four to be four of it.
We're going to have problems now to find food, water and cleaning and bas well, clean-hall.
It's going to be more harder less nine billion.
We can get more than five billion carbon billion carbon billion bards.
That means a million barlers to a day.
When we try to find biological processes or any kind of process to repiace them, it's going to be a huge challenge --
And in the more we have to keep up of CO2 emission of these materials that finishing in the atmosphere.
At day, thanks to scientific discoveries around the world, we have a databases with about 20 million genes and I like to think think that are the design components for the future.
The electronic industry has only only a dozen about components, and think about how many different things came out.
Our limits here are main reality and our imagination.
Now we have technical, because of these synthesization methods that we call what we call the combinatories.
We are able to build a big robot that can produce a million chromosomes to a million chromosomes to a day.
Think about processing these 20 million different genes or trying to get the processes to make the processes or drugs, new vaccines, we can change and craws, and create more biology molecular biology now that in the last 20 years of science.
And it's just a standard seletion selection.
We can choose to survival for possibility of survivors, chemical production, chemical production, chemical production.
This is a few software programmed with some software programmed to be able to seat, and designing species to the computer.
Well, we don't know necessarily as they will be no.
We know exactly what their genetic code.
Now we're focusing on the carbons of four-generation.
You saw you that you can go out of the fat was a bad-found experiment of the same.
We have a second and third generation and third generation that will use enough sugar to carbon disease, as the topator or different types of butanol.
But the only way that biology can have a great impact without more impact with the cost of the food and limited the cost of the food and the conversation would be transform CO2 matter in primas, which we work to design cells that can get the cells that can get the carbonons of four-half months.
The sunlight with the CO2 is a methodom -- but in our discoveries in all over the world, we found different metods.
This is a organism that we described in 1996.
It lives in the deep ocean deep about 2500 feet depth to the water temperature of the water.
It creates mix from CO2 using hydrogen molecular source of energy.
We're trying to understand if we can get CO2, that can easily be transported to be transported through your carbant, to let that CO2 in carbant, to let this process.
So the short we think we could be able to increase what the basic question, "What is life" is Now, truth," is Now, truth. We have the modest oil the whole industriy.
Exactly. If you can't do it from TED, where can you it?
You would become a main source of energy.
Also, we're working on using the same metods to create vaccines to create vaccinations.
You saw this year with influence, we're always back, and we are always back, and a dollar and a dollar in less when it's treatment.
I think that this is changing a result of combinable in ancient vaccinable in ancient time.
That's how the future might begin to seem to change it, the tree of evolution, acceling the evolution, accelerating the evolution, and then indeed, and then the eucariots.
We are so that we are so from the best people.
Our purpose is to live enough long enough to try to do it. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
So all I'm going to show you -- the most quickest possible, a fundamental work that we have taken to Microsoft to Microsoft in following almost a year ago exactly. This is Seadragon.
It's a environment that you can interact is in the local levels that remote with a huge amount of visual data --
So here we're seeing a lot of photo-toytells with a kind of constant photos and continue, to a speed fast bread, which I say the images as we want to images as we want to him.
And it doesn't matter how big the amount of information that we see, how big these data or images.
Most of them are communicates -- but this for example, it's a descansion from Bilibrary of Congress, and it comes into the Congress, and it comes into the range of 300 megapixel.
It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that limits the prastations of a system like this is the number of pixel on your screen at any time. It's also a very flexible architecture.
This is a book book of data not images.
This is the She's Casa desolated Dickens. Every cool represents a capitle.
So to show you that it's a text of text and not images, we can do something like this, to show that it's a real representation of a representation of the text of the text, not a photo.
It could be a little bit artificial way to read a little electronic book of electronic book --
You don't consider.
This is a more realistic. It's a number of The Guardian example of The Guardian examp.
Every image is the beginning of a section.
And it gives you a pleasure and the beautiful experience of a magazine version of a magazine or a newspaper of a newspaper, which is a lot of medrawing type of medrill.
We also did something with the angle of this number of this particular Guardian On.
We created a high-resolution to higher resolution -- much higher than what you use in a normal advertising -- and we put you in the normal content -- and we put you of the content -- and we had insert you have the content of extra.
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile, you can see here.
Or other models, or even the technical specific specific specific and even the technical specific specific and even the technical specific and even the technical specific specifies.
And that really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space to the screen.
We hope that this means to put a little bit of a chery and other class and other classis, not to be more retree to be necessary.
Of course, the maping is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology.
And I don't want to lose time if not to say that we have contributions to be as a camp.
These are all the roads in the U.S. As a high-image image of NASA.
So now we go to something else.
This is actually actually from vive on the web; you can go to see.
It's a project called Photosynth, which combine two different technologies.
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual research, a very interesting research, a student of the University of Washington, with the aid of Steve Steve Steve Steve Seitzeerz of U.S. R. Shi Research. An Research.
And it's from the vive on the web, managed by Seadragonon.
You can see it when we do this kind of screen that kind of screen to the other and have this kind of experience and have this kind of multiple experience.
But the collocation of the images here has actually a meaningful meeting.
The chanacities of visualization of the computer visualization together, so that the images that are the real places that imagine -- all the nearly closed to the Grass on Montags -- have been taken canay. So here are taken canay. So here are comechanay. So here are all colleagues of a slide-fected space.
I don't know if I have time to show you some other environment.
There's some more space than the space of them are more space than the space here.
I want to go directly to one of the original data from Noah-- and this comes from a precedent protype of Photosynthosynthosynthosynth. And this is really really really the key to show you what I think is really really really the key technology, Photosynth. And it's not necessarily as well. And it's not necessarily as well.
We had to worry about legal aspects and saying.
This is a rebuilding of the Cedral rebuilding Dame pictures from Flickr. Basta digitate Notare Dame in Flickr. and you get images of the camp, other of the field of the camp, and so fore you can see that this image is discovering a model.
So they're all pictures from Flickr and have been all connected to space this way.
And it's possible to navigate in this simple.
You know, I would never have thought of finish to work for Microsoft.
It's very free to get this kind of nice to get this kind of nice here.
I think you can see that it's a lot of different types of focamones of focusing SLee the cell phones of the SLR, a significant number of meaning environment, put in this environment.
And if you can try to look for those strange.
Many of them are blocked, etc.
Of here a few part here is a series of photographs -- that's a lot of photographs --
This is a poster of Notre Dame recorded Notre Dame rectly.
We can go from the poster physics of this envision of the envision of this environment.
The essential point is that we can do things with the social environment. This is now taking from everybody -- from the whole memory of viewing the hours, and it all those data together.
All those are connected together, more than the sum of the parts.
You have a model of the land that emerge.
Think about this as a motion of Stephen Lawler work,
It's something that grows in complexity as people using that people us, and the vantages to the use of the people to use it as a use.
Their picture are marked with other people.
If someone comes to contrast all these sang sends the name of these sanitor, my picture of Notre Dame of suddenly Dame of all of those dates, and I can use it as a point of engineering to immerged in the space in that universe, in that universe, in that metaphot in the space of a cross-type experience of a cross-type experience of a little bit of a cross-s-s-s-like s-and red-usbuterly re-ushyping and and and and and cross-ushing social experience of a pheral exty
Of course, a consequence of this are extremely elaboraborated virtual models, not only as much as a viewrace, not only viewing and images and satellitaries, but the memory of collective.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I understood OK? What your software will have to do is that at a certain point, in the next point, in the next few years, all the photographs of anybody in the world will be practically connected tog?
BAA: Yeah. What is doing is basically discovered.
It's creating hyperlink if you want to hyperlink to the images.
And it's doing it in the low-in-flow of images.
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the wealth information that many of these images can have a lot of these images.
As when you make a research, you know, you have a sentence and the head of the web is a lot of information about the pictures of the picture.
Now, what happens if that picture is connected to all your photo?
So the amount of interconnection, and the amount of realm and the amount of recharacter. It's a classic. It's a classic.
CA: Blaise, it's really incredible.
BAA: I thank you very much.
One of the main of the pills when you travel and the research of the ethnographics is the power of the anti-traditions, the ones who you've forgot the pasts in the wind pieces of the plants. He is in the plants.
You know, that sciancient sciancient Jaguar, the Lay Way and the Milky Way Inuit is still drilled me meaningful or that in Himalaya, the buddhood remind the respiration of the Dharma, to remember the central importance of the central anthropologies in sense in sense in sense in sense in sense in the absolute, but it's just a reality, but it's a reality,
the consequence of a particular choices of adaptations that our stirps has done --
And, of course, we all share of essential trately.
We all hidden it. We all procreive.
We are subjected to begin in and beginning.
We have to deal with the inexorability of death, so it doesn't surprising us and balliame, and they don't surprising --
We all have a art of them.
What it hits is the particular range of the song, the rate of the dog, the range of all culture.
Not matter that they don't matter forests of the Borneo, or the Haiti, or the Haiti, or the warriors of the desert Kair in Kenya secent settentence, the Curandlier in the heart of Sahara.
He was my journey in the desert of journey in the desert of yak in the middle of Qomolangma, on Everest, the mother, the mother's detain the world.
All these people teaching that there are other ways to think, there are other ways of thinking, other ways to think, other models of moving in the world.
And, if you reflect a moment, it's a concept that can give you hope.
And so that employriads of cultures of the world create a ragnail and cultural life and cultural to the planet and is important for the benefit as biosphering as biological raising as biosphere.
And you can think of this raising cultural raising ethnos; and you can define the ethnose. And you can define the total of all the concepts of all the concepts of the concept of the consciousness, intuitions to be from the imagination of consciousness,
The etnosfantastic is the fantastic monuraining of humanity.
It's the symbol of what we are and what we are in as species as a kind of inthese.
And because biosphere was free consumed by the equipment is going to be as quicker as faster and purposes --
No biology, for example, it would say that 50, it was about the hours of all the way to the hours of the hypocalitty -- in the most calculation -- in the most biological diversity -- and it doesn't even come near the most of the biological diversity.
The indication of all of this is, of course, the loss of language.
When you were born, there were 6,000 lings on this planet.
And a language is not only just by a vocabulary or a series of rules.
language is the spray-cle spirit of human spirit
It's the middle with which the animation of every culture comes into the material in the material in the material
Every lingly, a forest of mind, a inner ment, a thinking, a thinking, a though, a thought.
And those 6,000 lingues, as we are here in Monterey, at least half the half of the children's hours in the ears of children's ears
They don't get more teached teacher to children, which means, not something that we have died.
What is more sad than being fvolved by silence, to be the last to be the last to be the last to be language of the wisdom of the wish of the advantics or anicipate the promiss?
This is a flooring of somewhere in some part of the world every two weeks: every two weeks: every two weeks of a ancient language.
And I know someone of you will say, "Is it not better than this?
The world would not be a better place if we all let the same language?" Bensimple, then we all talk yorba.
We talk about kogi.
You will be able to be able to talk about your language is not to speak your language.
I would like to do today to do a journey through equipment --
a little journey in ethnose to give you a care of what we're lost of what we're lolost of what we're lolost of what we're lose.
Many of us forget that when I say, "different different ways of existing existing really different ways of exists.
We take for example, this bird Barasan Amazony, in Amazony settles, the population of anony-foot bit-foot of the west sacrise of the patterns of the sacric sacric of sacric sacric of patterns --
It's a popular popular that is not able to distinguish the blue of the green because the time chelests is identified in the forest, where it depends on the forest, which is identified in the forest,
They have a strange language and a marriage rule, called "examia of language, "Lookis: you have to be a different language.
And all of this has radicated in mythological past, all the particularity is that in these families are talking about six or seven languages to because of the mystic marriages because of the mystics of a language.
They listening to listening and then start talking about.
We take one of the most interesting tribes with which I lived with which I lived -- the Woranth, a popular popular popular popular popular popular that had the first contact in 1958.
In 1957, five missionaries have tried a committed contact error.
They made up from the float the top of photographs that were retled that that they were retough to the plug forest that the people of the plual forest, never seen anything bi-dimensional population.
They raised the photos from the ground, they turned to research, and they were not in the figur, they were concluded that it was a diavole, and they killed the five missionaries with the five missionaries with the lances.
But the Waorans didn't kill strangers.
They kill in a little bit of them.
54 percent of mortality was caused by their own themselves.
We are rising at eight generations and we found two of natural and when we insisted for knowledge that one of them was aging that one was aging that one of them was aging that has died by the same. And then they kill it was a knowledge of the forest.
The hunterers were able to recognize the animal from 40 steps and recognized the species.
In the early '80s, I was assigned a very interesting task when my professor of Harvard professor to go to Haititi to intrupholars to the base societies to the base of the power of Duvalier and TontMacoutes, and they can immate from the poish of the poison.
To give a sense to miracle sense of miracle, I should have understand the Vodoun culture and that the Voodoo is not nice magic.
It's a rather than a complex metahysics of the world.
Very interesting.
If I ask you to tell me the big religions, what would you say to me?
Cristianism, Buddhdhyo, Buddhismo, English --
A continent is always left out of it, thinking that sub-Saharan Africa, and he doesn't have no religious religious religious -- and the Voodoo deeply of these religious concepts that are very deeply in the slavism of the slavish of the slavissue.
What makes you interesting the intense is the intense of life and death.
So the live live to live the spirits.
You know, you can be invoccurred by Grande Aqua, they respond to the range of dancing and replaced to the dance of the view of the view that for a short of the following becomes the dio.
So you want to say "You white love to say, "You want to go to talk about God.
We dample, and we become God."
And since you're having to be a moment that you drive yourself, how can you do male?
So you have these amazing events of these incredible events in the state of trance evels that touches ink a rather strong the path of the power of the mind when it is catalyzed in the body of the mind when it's catalyzed in an extreme extreme.
So all the people I lived with the most extraordinary popules are the Kogi of Sierra Mars, in the Nevada Santa Marta, in the Colombia Mars,
The ancient scends of the ancient civilization that once were living on the conquist, the population of the conquist, the population population was going on on the massive vulcanic planury.
In a lectured continent blood -- this popular has never been conquered by the spagnoles.
At the today, they have governed by a classroom but their formation is really extraordinary --
The young people followed by the family three or four to three or four years and live in a good world of good and shadow in a hand-floor of the glaciers for 18 years.
Two nine years of choices to reproduce the nine months that spent the nine months that spent in the mother, now I'm metaphory in the Great Mad.
So this time, they get acculate to values of their society, values that predict their prayers and only their prayers and only their prayers -- or to say the balance.
At the terms of this incredible beginning, they are suddenly taken out and for the first time in life at them, at 18 years, they see a high alba. And in that awareness of the first bad of the first cutter, when the sun backy is confermed in his spring and said, "The pretty wrong and said,
"Really you? Proropress how I said,
It's stuff out. It's just you going to protect it."
They call the brothers and say that we can, brothers and say that we are the minors, we are the households of the world.
This level levels is extremely important.
When we think about the indigenous populations and the environment, we inquite Rousau and the old story of the wild history of the wild historical and maybe we ask Thoreu and saying these populations are closer to Earth of us.
The popules are not sentency are not sentency of nr indebuled by our algies.
There is no space for these things in the palues of Asmat the Ahsmall in the wind of the Tibet, but because of the time and they created a mystical mystical concept of the basis of beings but on a little bit of a little bit of a long time and a little bit of a long time can live because it infuses from human consciously --
What does it mean?
And that means a And, who grows that grows making that mountain is a spirit Apu that is a destiny human beingly different and it is a depth and have a report of different rocket and it will have a lot of different rocket with the mountain a Montana girl, and it will be a caved caved rocaves to be a badlam.
which is a demore or a mineral or a mineral is irrilevant.
What is interesting is that the metaphors that defines the report between individual and natural world.
I grew up in the forests of Columbia creating Britannica creating that the forests served to be cutterly cute.
And what he made me a different human beings from my friends Kway. Kway-maining the forests are the dimora of the dimora beah and the wind of the paradisease, and the history of the world, spirits that live in the beginning of the history of the world's beginning that they are in the beginning of the Hamatsa.
If you start to consider that these cultures can create different reality to understand some of them of some sensations. We take this plant. We take this plant.
I took this picture to open the normal Amazon the West Amazony
Maybe some of you have heard about ayahuadowling of the psychoice, the most powerful psychoic.
What makes away from the fascinating ayaask is not the drugs of the character, but its elaboration. It's compound two elements.
On one side, this lian, that conties that has a series of bet-carbolins, harmines and harmulti-carbon and harmulti-carbon and harmly hallucinogen.
Psychop is a piant blue smoke is a blue smoke that alters a little bit of the house of a house of the family of the fall of the fall of the fall of the fall of the way Psychotria viridis.
This plants conceiving sad powerful triptamine, very similar to servotonina, dimethoxoxoxoylmethodmethodmethodam.
If you ever see Yanomami guy's going to see the nose the hidden that are doing from a different species of set of species, che'd see it in a different species,
To give that a little bit about the nose is a little bit like being sang shot from a smoke and land and landing on a sea of electricity. It creates a distortion. It creates a distortion. It creates the reality. It creates the dissolution of reality.
I was often often in my professor, Richard Evan Shultes, the man who sent was psychedelic, with his psychedelic, with his foundation of hallucinogens in the '30s,
And in my type of my textinct these triptames like hallucinogens because if you can't tell anybody to be hallucinated because if you don't have any one of being hallucinated but they can not be abunted.
It's possible to assumption, only if you assums with other chemical chemical chemical chemical chemical chemical substates.
Now it's the beautiful better-carbins, which is in this lian. The lian. The same kind of needed to potentiate triamptamins. The question is to potentiate triams. The question is in a flofly. And as these popules are doing these popules to find two morphological popules to find two morphologycle -- but if you fight in this way?
We use the great euphemism of the proof of the proof the proof the proof of the proof of herror,
But if we ask Indians, they will tell us "The plants speak about it."
What does it mean?
This tribe, Cofan, has 17 variety of ayaas, which they distinguish in the forest, and that they would come into the forest, and that will come into the same species.
If they ask him how they are they going to tell us how much they will tell us "I thought I understand plant, I realized that plants, you know, I said, "No."
The solution is taking 17 varieties in a night of lense and each night with a different types.
With that you don't have to Harvard, but it's much more interesting than counting the stami.
Now, the problem is that also the problem is that the ones of us who have heart the people who are painting them in the history of the history of the real world -- and it turns out to our real world -- and spends it up.
In fact, the X-century, 300 years, not truth, in fact, in the wars or innovations or innovations and the technological innovations -- but rather like it was where we were stopped and we have been actively accepted to the mass of biological diversity and cultural diversity and cultural diversity and cultural diversity and cultural diversity and cultural diversity and the problem is not change.
All cultures through the centuries have been involved in a dance for new possibility of life.
And the problem is not technology.
The Sioux Indians have not stopped to be Sioux when they put them out and frecket, and they were not stopped to be Americans when they put part of the horses and hot horse."
It's not the change or the technology that threat the integrity of ethnow. It's the power.
The flight lasting of domination.
And if you give you a look at the world, you will discover that these are not shoot cultures to disappears.
They're living and dynamic creatures out of the indicate that is from the existence of the ability to adaptations.
What you can see you fit in the patric of the guys --
a popular now, in Sarawak, in south Asian west popular popular popular that lived in the forest generation and now reduced to the service and the reservice and the reservice of the rivers of the rivers of the rivers that seem to bring the rivers that seem to bring the horizonte, where the navoid the horizonte, where the ship Cavans were the orizonte,
printte to fill the wood below down,
Or in the case of the Yanomami, are the diseases that come with the discovering of the hour.
If we move on the Tibet, where I'm doing a lot of researching the flight of political domination of political domination of political domination
As you know the genocide, the physics of a population, is convicted to universal, but the ewing of the style of the style of the style of a popular popular extinction, but I celebrated in certain environment, because it makes part of developing strategy.
And you can't understand the suffering of Tibet until you go from the beginning.
I have spent the 6,000 miles from China occidental Western China occil through Tibet Tibet with a young young and college, but only came to Lhasa I realized the statistics that we have to hear about it.
6,000 world-sacred monuments in police and energy.
1.2 million people killed by military military in the Cultural Rvolution.
The father's dad of this guy was ascrited to Panchen Lama.
which means that means that was killed to the Chinese invasion.
His further out with Santity in Santity during the diaspora that has led the popular in Nepal.
His mother been imprisoned, and his colp was reted.
It was brought to carck the age of two years old, hidden under his gonna because it could not live without of him.
The smile that same, was done in the field of reeducation.
One day day he's really had, a cool fascia cool fashoot for seven years.
The Tibet of Tibet can be instantly, but the spirit of the population is from tener.
At the end, everything comes to a choice.
We want to live in the monodd world of the monodd the policyromatic world, or we want to get the policy?
The great anthropologistaret Mead, before he died that his greatest country was that, in our world, we don't only see the whole gam's view of the world, we don't just see the whole range of human imagination -- but one day we see a day -- but one day we wake up to a sleep in the sleeping out of a sleeping to be able to live it from a sleep.
And it's ur to remember that we have for 600,000 years.
The Neulth, Neull Rvolution that agriculture, which has done us to the seeds to the seeds of seeding, replacing the poem, creating the gerarchies, creating the gerarchia of the specialization of the specialization of the specialization of the specialization of the specialization, and we have 10,000 years ago.
The modern industrialized world has 300 years.
That is not suggests that I don't suggests that we have answers to all the challenges that we have to face in the thousand years.
When these myriades of cultures of the world is ask what it wants to be human --
And it's in these answers that we all responsible risk of being what we are. And this is a consciously -- that we have to do all the people and all the people and all the gardens can trust. And there are great time of optimism.
I took this picture on the north-houd Inu, when I went to hunt hunters with the Inuit, and this man, Olaya, he told me the wonderful story of his grandfather.
The Canadianadiseased with the Inuit and in the '50s to stabilide our sound to stabilide our sound we have them in colonies.
The grandfather, the grandfather, he refused to go there.
The family time, by his life, he took all the arms, and all his arms, and all of his attrecks.
You have to know that Inuit not the cool, the freeze,

One beautiful examples of how a country, can reconciliate with his people.
And, finally, I think it's quite obvious at least to the people who have been in these remote areas of the planet, realized that they don't have remote that they don't have remote that they don't have remote remote that they don't have remote that they don't have remote that they don't have remote that they don't have remote that they don't have remote remote that they don't have remote that they don't have remote.

Finally, we finally, of National Geographic is convinced that politicians will never get anything.

in which the wisdom of all the people can contribute to our well.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some things I wrote in this book that I hope I call other than I hope and I'm going to try to get some collegments, in case not know.
I want to start with what I call "the official dog.
The official dogm official dog,
The official dog, official societies industrial societies. The dogmam official citizen: "If we want to massive citizen."
The reason that is from one side, in fact, that the freedom is in a value, is precious, usely, essential essential beings.
On the other is that if we are free, each of us can act to do everything that massive to do what massive our well-being, without any one that decide in name our hand.
The way to massive liberty is to massive choice.
More people choices people have the more choices is their liberty, and the freedom is their well.
This one, is so deeply radicated in society that no one would be dreamed to put it into the two-foot as a foot it.
And it's also deeply radicated in our lives.
I'm going to show you some examples of what the progress has made possible.
This is my supermarket. It's not particularly large.
I put a simple named on a simple note on the condition.
In my supermarket are 175 conditions, without contrain to 10 varieties of oil and 12 acets acets and 12 acets acets you can buy a huge number of conditions, and the tremendous number of increasing in the surrounding of your degradiments is of your degradiments.
That's how the supermarket.
And then you go to the electronic store, to buy a stere: cassroom, CD, radio Look, fair, paper.
And in this single negotiate electronic number of components of audio of components.
We can make six and a half million different half of different combination using components that there are in one negotid.
You have to admit that there is a lot of choice.
Other camp: the world of communications.
Once time, when I was a child, you could get all the services desires, to the cat the cat the moment that they were forned by mom Bell.
He read the phone -- you didn't buy it out.
One consequence of that, between the other, was that the phone doesn't break out.
These days are gone to them.
So now we have a variety of phone almost illitated phone the phone the cells.
Here's the cell phones of the future.
My favorite is in middle, letter MP3, cutting the nose, and form in the nose, and form for the now,
If you have not seen it in the store, you have seen under in the store, you're going to be a reverse to pretty much rever.
And what the one happens is that people go into negozos and ask this question. And you know what the answer? The answer is "No."
It's not possible to buy a cellphonee that doesn't make too much and
So, in other aspects of life that are much more important than water than the same explosion of choice.
Assistance is not happening in the United States that you go from doctor and the doctor you have to do.
Instead, you go to the doctor, and the doctor says, "Okay, could we do A, "As these good" and these risk" goods, and these risks. What do you want to do?"
You say, "Dr, what should I do?"
And the doctor says, "As these goods and these risk."
"What do you want to do?"
And you rebat the point if she was to me, what do you do?"
And the doctor: "But I am not her."
The result of malato," we call it the malato," expression that makes it seems a beautiful thing.
But in fact, it's not that one to move the weight and responsibility to make someone else that somebody else that is the doctor, and someone else -- and so it doesn't knows anything else -- and so in the conditional conditional to make the patient equal to decision, to make the patient that patient.
There's a huge marketing of drugs, direct to people like me and you, that if you think of it doesn't make any sense, that we don't have any sense, data that we can't buy them.
But if we can't buy them, why do we public them?
The answer is that they want domor we call the doctor to change the recipe to change the recipe recily.
And so foundation of that fundamental is a choice, as you see in this view of choice, as you see in this view of the children. They'll not want to force their sex moment -- we don't want to get a identity: we have to invent the identity: we have to inve.
And we can reinvention us as a lot of times aggreat.
which means that every morning, you have to decide that every morning, you have to decide that kind of person wants to be.
Rememploying and marriage, a common prospective -- a lot of a where, was that you could get the most pretty much as you could as the most pretty much as possible, and it started the pretty much as possible.
The only real choice was with choice was with choice was -- not just a whatever.
Ogame, it's really play.
I teach them very smart students, and I think about 20 percent less than a time.
And because they're not less because they're not less because they're less diligents.
but why are they impensiers, I met I said, "I should have I I should do it now? I should do it now?"
"I should have I have to think I have to think about before I have I have to think about the children or career?"
They're interrogatives --
And they try to answer these questions, even if this imply not completing compititself and not get a well-beautiful to my exam.
And they really have to do that. They're important.
Now, the work: we're lucky, like Carl under teens because technology allows us to work every day, from every day, from every day, from every day of the planet, trans from Hotel Randolph.
Now parentess, there's a angline, and I'm not going to tell anybody where, where the WiFi Fi works.
I don't say that I don't say that I want to use it.
What does this incredible freedom to choices that we have to work on work? Is that we have to decide -- if we have to work or not.
We can go to the ball, play to play hot with the cell phone in the task, the Blackberry in the other, and the knet of the knee.
And even though they're all frightenes, every minute that we see our son boy to the tity, we are also asking, "I have to answer this called it?"
"I have to answer this email? I have to kis? I have to kill this letter?"
And even when the answer is "no," all this makes the experience of your child very different than what it would be in other conditions.
So, from any part of the look at all, things and big objects and big objects and life, life is a question of choices.
Once the world was this: Of course, there were some possibility, but it was not a choice.
The world today is like this, the dilemma is, "Is it a good thing or negative negative or negative negative now?"
The answer is Should the answer is Shold.
The positive sides of them all of the negative to the negative people.
All this choice two negative effects two negative effects.
The first one, paradoxilizing is that produced paralysis instead of free.
With a lot of options between which choice, it becomes very difficult to do it.
I offer an example of mean -- a study of measurement.
A colleague has access to the Vanchech of Vancheesses with about a million clients with about a million clients of clients in 2,000 different companies.
What she found is that for every 10 solutions that are offered to every 10 solutions that are offered to the percent.
With 50 sources is 10 percent less than the fact that they have been available to when they have available to only 5. Why?
Because with 50 source 50 source that choice, is malezly difficult decision, and choices is sent to questions.
And at questions, and ask questions, questions, and questions, and of course, questions not come from it.
You know, you know that the decision that these workers will be able to the food for cans because they don't have enough money, it means that decision is that decision is that decision is that they lost the founds of work.
Not participand, they're losing up to 5000-dollars for a year from work, which would be a craft-deployed to crafts.
So the paralysis is a consequence of have.
And I think that makes the world like this.
"And finally, for the eternity: ketchup or maione?"
You would just take the right decision if it's eth, it's for eth, right?
You don't want to choose the wrong foundation, and neps the wrong condition.
So this is the first effect. The second is that even if we can avoid the paralysis, and we ended up the paralysis of how we were going to be less options with less options that we were with less options that they choose the screen.
And this for different reasons.
One of these is that with a lot of conditions, which is that you have to be a perfect and it's not perfect, it's easy to imagine that you would have a different choice. And what happens is better than it would be better and and maintains and the report of choice, and the sods, and the repiece of choice, and the soft rerecognized the sofloating sodden the realm of the represent
even when it was a great decision.
More choices us are easier to be sorry, I am pleasure that it's insure that it's insure of the choice.
Also, there's what economists are called cost-opportunity.
Dan Gilbert asks, a lot of bad stamacine as the value that we depends on what we confront with it.
In the rest of that, when there are many options possible options, it's easy to represent the alternative careistic carts, and less less the option that you have choice.
Here's an example. I used with all the ones that are not in New York.
But it's what you probably thinking.
There's this copy to Hamptons.
A place of luxury.
Spid day. It's all a beautiful day. It's all for them.
Not anything. But what he thinks is, "Well, what he thinks is, "Well, Augstop is it."
"Everyone of my neighbors are alized."
"I could talk to the face right in front of it."
And it spends two weeks assilled by the idea that is losing -- every day -- the chance of parking where you want.
The expensive opportunity decrease sure that we have, even when the choice was excellent.
And more are the options that we have to considerate, the more characteristics will be recovering us as a cost-opportunities.
Here's another example.
This view is a lot of things.
We talk about the time time is to live at the moment, and maybe living slowly.
But the most important point is that any thing you choice, you choose you don't do others.
The things that we don't choose have a lot of facactive that we do.
Third point: growing spiral growing of the expectancy.
I tried to my skin, buying a new jeans.
I begin to almost always jeans.
Once jeans were just one type, they were bought and clothed to the bestia, they were dissimis, and they got a life and worked and worked a lot of times, they began to go good.
So, I went to buy a couple of new when the old ones were going, and I said, "I need a couple of jeans, this is my cute."
The committed comfort said, "You want slim fit, rexed phiteasy fitted fit?"
Who wants with the cernight or bottonight? "With Stonebonebonds," or "acidbonds?
"Would you like the ropt you want to roll?"
"Of eight you want to be strety? Build? Buil, he was a little bit of elense
I was a wind of jeans, and after a little bit I said, "I want the only chees," he didn't know what the only guys I was a type I was a type of jeans, I came out of the negotio, and then I was the best jeans, and the best couple of jeans, I had gone to do.
It was the mas. And all that choice had the best I got the best one.
But I felt worse --
Why? I wrote a book about it.
The reason I was worse for that I was worse with all that choice were very high to be perfect altish -- the jeans had to be perfect perfect for the whole bunch of my own mind.
I started minimum at all. I didn't expect anything that I was expected when it was a type, but when you lightly have a perfect.
What I had water was good -- but not perfect.
After I had talked about the choick with what I was trying to insure I was looking at the expectancy.
The add of options in the life of people don't increasing the expectations that these have respectacular options.
And this will make less sodden satisfaction, even when the results are good here.
Nobody in marketing in marketing if you make it matter.
Because if you know what I'm talking about, you won't know what I'm talking about.
The truth is more like this.
"You were better when he was worse when he was worses when he was worse when it was worse when it was worse when it was worse when they were worse was still possible to meet the surprising surprising pleasant to be able to meet pleasant to be as possible as they were worseized.
Today, in the world that we live -- opulgs, industrialized citizens with the expectancy of the perfection -- the massive we can hope is that things are at the high of expectancy.
You never have a surprising pleasant because your own expectancy, my expectancy expectancy.
The secret of happiness -- what you're here -- "Baspectancy waiting for you you to her."
I mean -- small time audience -- which I really have -- which I really am married and is really amazing and is really amazing it.
I couldn't have been doing better -- I didn't have any exacted.
But you count not always have a bad thing.
And finally, a consequence of buy jeans comfortable when there's only that jeans is that when you are not satisfact, and you ask "Why?"
"Who is responsible for her?" And the answers.
The world is responsible. What could I do we do?
When you have hundreds of jeans, and they buy a insure and you buy a responsible insods, and you ask who is responsible to you are you.
You could do it better than that.
With hundreds of varieties available, there are not for insuccess.
So when people make decisions, even if the result is valid, they feel insatisface, and they get the hit and they give them a house.
In the last years the last years the depression is exploded in the industrialized world.
I think a factor -- not the unique, but important -- not the unique, but the important -- of this depression is that people have deludge because the standard standard experiences because the standard standard is too high.
And when they have to explain this situation think that the colp is there.
So the final result is that in general we are better, objectively, but we feel worse.
Let me remember you.
This is the official dog, what we all take for good and it's completely falso. It's not true.
There is no doubt that a little bit of choices is better than I don't have that have no done that that multiple is better than a little bit.
There's a critic, magic value. I don't know what it is.
But I'm sure that we have been sure that we have been sure that the best choices that choices the best choices that choices are sure that we have been sure that we have been sure that we have been sure that we have been sure that we have been sure that we have been sure that we have been quite sure that we have been sure of a piece of the
Now, from the political point -- I have almost finished from the point of view is the following point of view is the following point.
What it allows you to all this choice in society is the material society is the material.
There are many places in the world, and you know about it parts of these places in the world, and you know that they have a lot of choice.
The problem is that they have too much at it.
So the fact that the fact I'm talking about is a malesclusive of modern modern, societies
And what makes and arrabing and arraby is this: Steve Levitt talked about how these costs and spreading and seats are useful.
I mean that these choices, complicated and dispendous, it's not just useful.
They're deleteries.
They make it worse.
If a little bit of what our societies allows is allowing in those where people have too poor chance in those where people have too much chance to be better and better life but also --
This is what economists are called a paretian.
A redistribution, it is not just to the poor -- not just to poor -- not just to poor -- because of this choice that back back to us back at the time.
So you can become to concluding everything you can become everything you want,"
You know, people of culture, you know, what does that weight -- "What does that weight do?"
"It's obvious that you can't make anything in a glass of glass of glass."
"Austrate; a limited view of the world."
and I was interpret like this, at the beginning.
But then, I think that fish is that fish the long fish knows that fish the long time.
Because the fact that is that if you manage in frank the franms, so that "everything is possible" is not good for freedom.
If you break the mouth in a way that you can become a deft.
You can take the paralysis, and you reduce the well-bee.
Everybody needs a sphere.
This is almost certainly too strectly, perhaps even for us.
But the absence of some symbolic symbolic symbolic and time.
Thank you very much.
