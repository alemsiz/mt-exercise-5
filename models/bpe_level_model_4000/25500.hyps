Last year I showed these slides to show that the article to show that the artical calote, which for almost three million years has had had the size of 48 United States continents, is 40-American dimensions of the U.S. continental --
However, this undervalue of the problem because it doesn't show the ice of the issue because it doesn't show the ice of the ice of the ice.
The artic headed bycalculation is in a sense, the heart heart of global climate system.
It comes out and winter and return it into the summer and return it out.
The next slide is going to be a rapid carroll on the last 25 years.
The ice lost ice loads are deliver.
As you see, they expand they expand it up to the blue blue blue blue blue blue blue blue blue blue blue blue blue blue blue
That's the ice in the winter that it reports of the summer in the summer of the summit.
You can see the cosident cosidence ice cosider ice of five years or more, is like the blood here is the body.
In 25 years has been from like this.
This is a problem because the interest is interested in the ground of the grounded around the ocean and where there are huge carbon congelated amount of coal carbon congelated which, they turn into the microbial deep --
It turns out to the total pollution, global warming from global warming, that amount of global warming, that amount could double that will double a bunch of the poll.
In some deep lages in Alaska is already rebolling from water.
The professor's Katey Walter of the University of Alaska was based on a team lower slow.
Video: Wow! Al Gore: She is good. The question is if we will also be us.
One reason is that this termal exchange from the northermal Genlland,
This is a glacial record.
The laughed -- he had never reached levels.
This is the Kangerlussuaq, in the Southern of the Groenland of the Groenland --
If you want to know how the sea level of the sea ice of ice on earth on the ground therrafer, here is where the sea.
These are going to be increasingly.
On the other part of the planet: Antarctican of the planet.
The month of the scientists have dived that the ice of ice is negative, and that Antartide Western artide Western -- which is particularly rapid in the high-tomorrow iss.

But when it decrease it is the same happens to the water water pound.
In California news on Sierra Nevada is 40-percent.

The predictions as you have read, it's grave.
The growing security in the world leads to a sell increase of the prevents.
The environmental disaster disaster is increasing a rhythm and without previous precedently.
Four time is in the last 30 years of respect the last 30 years of previous 75.
This is a whole bunch of all insustainable.
If you look at the history context if you can see it consequences.
In the last five years we've added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons of tons in the oceans every day.
Look at the area of the Pacific, from Americh, and in both the subest, and both the subject parts of the subject continent, where there's an impoor the oxygen.
The greatest causes of global warming, with deforestation, which is 20 percent, is the use of fossil fuels.
OOn oil is a problem, and the carbon is even worse.
The United States are one of the two countries with more emissions, with China.
And he proposing to build a lot of more central central central central of the carbon central central central central of the carbon central different carbon central other carbon central and
But we're looking at a direction.
These are the projects that are the last few years and some evils of alternative evil.
At every way, there's a political lotta in our country.
The coals of coalone and oil industry has spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote carbon and oxymor.
That image I would remember something --
Very Natal, in Tennessee, where I live, there was a 3.8 billion liters of carbon dishes.
Maybe you saw it on the news of news news.
This is the second biggest flow of scale in America.
It's successful around Natal.
The natalization of one of the coal industries was this.
Video: It's about carbon and the carbon is a kind of coaleat and happy.
It's abundant here in America, and it growing our economy.
Frosty the carbon is and more and more and more cleaner and more cleaner.
It's good price, adorable and the work workers are maining it.
Al Gore: From all of the West Virginia.
The biggest larger society about mountains is Massey. This is his friend's Massed. This is his friendly.
Don Blankenship: I'm going to be clear -- I was a little bit of -- Al Gore, Nancy Reid -- they don't know what they're talking about.
Al Gore: So the Alleance for the Clima Project has launched two campaigns.
This is a kind of like that.
Video: Attor: At COALercience we see climate changes like a sery sery threats to our business.
So our priority is to invest a big amount of money in a very high high school in a publicly publicly advertising and truth truth to coal.
In fact, carbon is not sport.
We think it's cleaned -- it has a good profum.
So not predicted about climate change.
Let me do it.
Video: Attor: The Cban pulipped -- I heard a lot of it.
So let's do it a kind of a structure to a framework to be about the clean coalone to the kind of a clean coalone to the kind of a kind of a fair.
Straordinary. The machines are a little rommous, but this is the sound of the fuel of the fuel of the carbon technology --
The carbon consumer is between global warming causes of global warming, but the genetic technology of the cleaning technology that you see it changes everything.
To a look at the occurrent technology.
Al Gore: Infinally, the alternative alternative positive to economic issue and the national security.

Now, yet, there's a new solution for users to circumstances.
Rear America: 100% clean energy in 10 years.
One of them to get the global warming to the work that makes us safe and help the global warming.
Finally, a solution that you basts to solve our problems.
Scover America. Scover more
Al Gore: This is the last one.
Video: It's about retrouble to America.
One of the fastest ways of putting up dependence from fuel to dependence that kills our planet.
Comparsa: The future is here. You know, a new energy network --
It's about 2: 2: Novi investments for very well retribites.
Comment: Rear America. It's time to be realists.
Al Gore: A old proverbial African is like, "If you want to go speeds.
If you want to go far far away together."
We have to go far fast.
Thank you very much.
LHC. Last year at TED I got a LHC.
And I promises to go back to you how the machine works.
So here I have. And for those people who are not there, the LHC is the biggest scientific experiment, the biggest scientific experiment.
Her job is to reach the conditions that were less than a billion second of the beginning of a second from the beginning of the universe -- until 600 million times a second.
That's just the same environment is just the way.
This is the car under Ginevra.
We Fotographic these min-Big Bang in the relevel of the book.
This is what I work. It's called ATLAS -- it's largo 1, 4-meters and has a 2,000-foot diameter diameter of 2meters.
This is a spectacular image of ATLAS in built so you can see the proportions.
We have the last year in the last year we have accession in the first time.
And this picture was taken by ATLAS.
It was because of a bunch in the room in control.
It's a picture of the first piece of particles that had done all the LHC, and in collision, deliberately, with a part of the LHC, and detecting particles into the relevel of the LHC, and detecting particles in the relevel.
In other words, when we saw that image the 10 secember, we understood that the machine works, which is a great living.
I don't know if it was going to do it exhibition to Google and he saw on Google and lives that the page was this.
That means that we had a cultural impact beyond in the scientific impact on the scientific impact impact on the scientific impact impact on the scientific impact of the scientific impact as well.
About a week later, there was a problem with the machine, it had to the movies here -- these dors.
These files bring 13,000 prints when the car works at the massive of the power of power.
Now, the technical between you and they will look at the files and say, "That's not true. It's not true.
And instead can do it because they are very fresh the superconducting film.
So, at least 271 degrees, at least 271 degrees, these films can bring that current to it.
In one of the junctures between the most nine -- there was a fairly fairly factory of factory.
So the files are going to read read lightly, and 13,000 amps suddenly meant a electrical resistence.
This was the result.
Now, this is even more impressive if you think these beautiful fish magnetic fish about 20 tons and that are moving out of about 30 centimeters.
They were damaged about 50 magnets.
We had to take it to take it to the way.
We have repristined and updrugs.
Now they're going to come back to their place underground.
I would take the end of the mark the LHC is going to be new inteam.
And I want to get it and we expect to get some data to fit to be able to get data to discover what the morning, and so our avventure to discover what are the morning.
Now, of course, in a certain quote, these incident debate the value of science and engineering the value of science and engineering the frontier.
I think that the fact that it's so difficult to go beyond the limits, I think this is the value of things like LHC.
I want to end with the words of a scientist scientist Humphrey Davd, the way, in defense of the useless experiments in his pupill, his pupill, his pupill, he was Michael Faraday, said, "No is that it was a lot of the mind of the human mind of the human mind that is not mysteries in nature, that our triumps, that our tries are completely completely completely new confilled to conquoted new mons of conquitted to conquitute with us.
Thank you.
I want to start asking you to think about how a kid, as a kid, you played courage coin.
As you can get them and get them and reach them and to make them and move them, and you learn to think about and solve problems and solve and solve problems and resolve relationships.
The space is deep is deep connected to the way we understand a lot of the world around us.
So, from informaty of our interaction with our physical objects with physics, and I started to my consulator Jevan Kalthi, and my Jevan Kalthi, I started asking asking "And when we use a computer, instead of having the only degree of the mouse as a computer, you can only move on a moves that you a desktop, we could make it because of information with both both mans,
and we get our pleasurageous please?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer, building the answer, building the Siftable.
In a few words, a Siftable is a very big kind of like a biscoop.
In a few words, a Siftable is a very big kind of like a biscoop.
You can move them with the hand, they can see their movement and they have a screen and a wireless radio wireless.
But above all, they're physics, like the morning, you can just move on on on the morning.
The Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem tools to manipulate information about digital information.
And as they become more physics, you know about the motion, and the others, and as they become more physics, and as they become more physics, and as they become more physics, of others, as we diovid, we can explore new and different stiles.
I'm going to start with some simple example.
This Siftable is configured to show video video video -- if you include it into a direction, the video will rooters like this, if you stick from the other side side the back.
These interactive rates are interactive rates of others.
If you stick it to be interested in what they are doing.
If they come circumstances, they can get it a little bit.
If they come circumstances, they can get it a little bit.
They also have their movement and clination.
We then realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was the common to the data, and to say, "a Well a color like a liquid.
In this case, we have three Siftable configured as a bunch and I can use them to look for the color in the middle of the color in that central color in the central that they mik.
and I can use them to look at the color in the central color in the central color to the color in the central color in the central color in the central color in the central color in the central that is missing to the color in the central color in the central color in the central color in the central color in the central color of
We can do it too much of it.
There are also good and the apprint, like languages, the mathematics and logic games where people can try to do things quickly and see the results of the things that and see the results are immediately.
Now I'm --
This is a Fibonacy sequence that I do with a equations.
Here we have a words of words that is half of the Scarabeo and Boggle.
Moricically, at every turns, you get a letter on every Siftable, Pratic -- every turns, you get a letter to go on Siftable, and as you try to make words on a dictionary.
And then after about 30 seconds remisses and you have a new set of reading and new possibility to try it.
Thank you.
Here's what the children came to the Media Lab, I did in the way they tried them and turned a video video.
They are very pleasure.
And one of the interesting things about this kind of application is that you don't have to give people a lot of educational things that are educational to people a education.
You just have to say, "Compons of word," and they know exactly what to do.
Here's what other people who do it.
This is our youngest better, youngest testers there on the road.
It actually wanted to plug it.
They were only morning, for him.
Now, this is an applation of a cardboard interactive.
We wanted to build a tool for learning lings, Lui is Felix.
It can be able to put new characters in the scene, satis;
It can be able to put new characters in the scene, satis;
This is doing the sun.
Video: The sole is surgend.
David Merrill: Now it led a treatment in the scene.
Video: The arancient treat.
Bel job.
So I suspect and put it close up neighbors --
Video: Bau!
-- by inventing their story.
Video: Hello.
DM: It's a story with the open final end and it can decide him how you did.
DM: It's a story with the open final end and it can decide him how you did.
Video: God is the gap.
DM: The last example I have time to show you is a tool -- I did a very recently did for sampling and exeguing music.
It's a very instrument, made recently recently for sampling and executionary and executterly expanded by the music.
The Siftable here act sounds like low-based suits and bacteria --
Every one of these four different variations, and you can choose what you use.
You can put these sounds in a compounds in a compound.
And to show it just by doing a sound," and a "Rededit."
These are actually that you can control from the live, like the reveral and filter.
You attacks to a particular sound and then including it for the star.
And then there are the general effects like time and flouous, that you apply to the whole sequence.
We look at how it works.
Video: We will start by putting a basic basic basic in two Sift," we get into a seriously, we get into a seriously, we add other low.
Now I put a blow.
DM: Now I add d percent of the ussions.
Video: And I'm going to put the filter to the bacteria, so I can control the effect of the live.
Video: DM: I can fit the whole whole sequence by a bunch or from the other.
Video: And I'm going to add the filter to the bottom to give more expression.
Video: DM: I can recombined the sequence "fle."
So I don't have to plan it before, but I can sudden, make it longer or more course.
And now, finally, I can smoke the whole sequence by the Siftling, "volume."
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is to build new interfaces man-seat, more like a function-way way our brain and body.
And today, I had time to show you one of the results of this lost and also some possibility that we try to bring out from the lab --
The concept I want to transmit is that it's coming this new generation of objects designed to interact with digital media media in our world in the way we want.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the time to talk to all of you.
I'm a writer.
And I think of books is my profession is more than that, of course, of course, but it's more than that.
It's also love and the folks and my life.
And I don't expect that can change.
But, I said that something particularly happened in my life and in my career, who took me to get the whole relationship.
The particular thing is that I have recently wrote this biography called "Mangia, Prega, and the quality -- quality -- I mean, I would make the books -- for some reason he used in the world and become a big sake, sensely conditional.
And the result is that everywhere is now the people treat me as if I was convicted with it.
It's true -- convicted -- convicted -- convicted --
They all come from me to do this worried and said, "You don't afraid to do better.
You don't keep writing for the whole life without being able to do it more life without being able to make a book that can importing to someon?"
that can matter somebody?
It's rassicury, you know.
But it could go worse -- I remember that more 20 years ago, when I started to tell people -- I was a adolescent -- I was a training adolescent -- I wanted to be a writing.
I would like to meet the same reaction based on the fear.
And people said, "Don't you have successful to be able to have success?
You don't fear that the humiliation of refusing kill?
You don't fear to do this mestize all life without any life without it is ever outside and die on a heart of dishing with a multi-shock bank with a mouth-shelter of fingingers?"
So I mean, you know.
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is: "Yes."
And I have just one of those things.
I always had fear.
And I also have a lot of other things that people couldn't instruct.
As the algae and other things are spavings.
But, as I was writing what I was thinking, and I asked me to ask me the very very very good is why?
Is it rational?
It's lological that anyone who should be pushed by a job that you feel born to do.
But what is that we have so that in the creative impresuming us about the mental health is about the mental health in a way that other careful people don't do it?
As my father, for example, he was a chemical engineer and I don't remember one time in his 40 years of activity in which he was asked if he was afraid engineer chair, you know, if he was fear to be engineer chapter and engineer to it?
It was never -- that block of engineer engineer how do it happen?
It didn't work like this, you know, right?
Onestly, chemicals like they don't have certainly in the seat, and they gain the reputation of being alcouraged to be alcoil.
We have enough that reputation and not only writers but creative about all of these generes, we have this reputation of being enormously instable to be able, mind.
And it's not going to look at the tristage of the magnifies of the magnifies that creative dies that only in the 2th century, and often often to each other.
And even those who are not suicide seem to be really dispersed by their women.
Norman Mailer, before of die in the last interview said, "On my book has killed a little bit more extraordinary about the work of their own life.
But we don't do the boy when we heard this is because we heard these things so much long, and we have completely interiorized and accepting the notion and suffering the notion are in a kind of wood, and the art, and then you will go to the enjoy and the art, and then will it go to the front of the angotta --
And the question I want to ask all of today, is you know, are you agree?
And it goes to you very good for this thing -- because you look at a hundred distance to me not good for anything about this suppose.
I think it's odied.
And I think it's also dangerous, and I don't want to see the perpetuated in the next century.
I think it's better to encourage our great minds to lives.
And I certainly know that, in my case -- in my situation would be very dangerous to start out to be supposed to be supposed to suppositions, and the drug in my career.
It's really -- I mean, I'm pretty young year-old -- I have about 40 years.
I have about four decades of work in me.
And it's very likely that anything else I write about now is going to be judged by the world as a work that came after the last book.
He just slaves, because we're all more or less friends here -- is likely to my greatest successful here is to my shoulder.
Oh, Gesus down, which I think!
You know, this is the kind of thought that leads a person to start bing gin the morning, and I don't want to do it.
I would just keep doing this work that we do.
So, the question becomes the question of it it be?
And so I think, after many reflection -- that the way to work to continue to write both to write is to create a perted, right?
I have to find a security distance between me, that I'm writing about it, and my natural anxuity to be on what it was written about what it was writing about it as I started looking for all over the time, trying to find other societies to see if they could have the best ideas and more healthy and more health ideas about whether they could have better ideas and more healthier and more health and more health and more health and more healthy
how to help people create creative people gesture inerent rises of creative life emotional rises of creative life emotional responses of creative life emotional rises of creative inherents to make it emotional rises of creative inherents of creative life life emotional rises of creative iners' inerents to help people create emotional rises of creative inerent rises.
And that research me led to the Great and ancient Room.
See the waitems because it gives into the circle and back back.
In the ancient Gree and ancient Rome -- people didn't look like creativity that creativity sevenity was inspiring from men -- OK?
It was thinking that creativity was this spirit watching and seven-in-unknown men from a few distant and unknown away.
The Greeks were called these spirits degrees of creativity "demonior "demonise."
Socry, wonderful, he believed to have a demon wisdom that elargives.
The Romans were the same idea, but they called that kind of spirit without a genius
And that's great, because Romans didn't think that a genius was really smart.
They believed that a genius was this kind of divine entity that created was literally in the study of a artist, a little bit like the elfe Dobby, and who came out to hidden the job of that was borhood and to assisting the job of that work.
Ecceptal -- -- execut, that is the distance of what I talk -- that psychological costructure, which is protected by the results of your work.
And everybody knew that was so that it was so that it worked, right?
So the antic artists were protofs from certain things, like for the too narcisssmism, right?
If your work was exceptional and it was very very well not going to take all of the mer, all knew that he was helped by this incorporeo.
If your failure, it was not all of your job and it was not all of your own bad.
Everybody knew that it was your genius to be a incapable.
And so people han EOcent people creativity in the Ocent for a long time.
And then the Resear, and all of the way, and we can put the whole human being to the center of the universe and the mysteries and mysteries and no longer creatures that write to details from divinity.
This was the principle of the humanth rational human. And people started to think that creativity was completely from the iron.
And for the first time in history, it started to stop this or that artist as a kind of a genius as a kind of a genius to a person with genius.
And I have to tell you, I think it was a big mistake ward.
I think we allow someone, a simple person to believe that being like a recipe of being like a recipe as a source, the essence and the sistance of all the mysteries and unknowable to fragile fragile --
It's like to ask somebody to ingowear the sun.
It deform and the whole ego and creates all these ingestiable expected expectations on the performance.
And I think it's been this pressure that I decrease the artists in the past age age of the past 500 years.
And if this is true, and I think the question is, and I think the question is it?
Can we do it different?
Maybe go back to a more ancient understanding of the relationship between humans and creative mystery
Or maybe not.
Maybe we can't do 500 years of rational thinking in a 18 minutes.
And there are people in the audience that would be relief of scientific suspes on the notion of scientific suspes on the notion of the maker of their projects.
And I probably won't convince you all about this thing.
But the question I would like to ask is -- why now?
Why don't you think about it this way?
Because it has more sense of everything that I've ever heard to explain the asperformance of creative process.
One process that you ever have been trying to do something -- therefore, basically, all here -- yeah, it doesn't really get rationally.
And, in fact, it can look like completely paranormal.
I did this meeting recently with the extraordinary poetry in Ruth Stone that has now 90 years, but that was a poetry for all life and said that in his childhood in the rural, and he was working out in the field, and he was going out in the fields and he was in the country was in the country.
He said it was like a fragorous fragorous fragory.
And he came to roll up to her from the landscape.
He was going to be getting it to get the earth under his feet.
He knew it was going to have one thing to do to do that point and he was like, "currency."
And it was going to go home and he was insane from this poem, and it would not have to make a piece of paper and a matter, fairly freeze, and it would collect it and rate it on the page.
Sometimes he couldn't be fast enough quickly, so it was so fast and correct and running without getting to the poetry and the poetry rolled through and she was lost and she would roll through the landscape, and he would be rolling, as she said, "other than a poet."
And then there were times -- this piece I don't forget it -- there were moments in which it was almost lost moments in which it was almost lost down?
So, he was running at home and he was trying to pay and the poetry was going through the poetry and he was a matched in the way he was passing, and then he was like to put the other hand and the step off.
He was going to go and the poetry from and and it released it into his body and turned it on the page.
And in these cases, the poetry is going to be on the perfect page and intacts but the word, the word, the word to the first word to the first word to the first word to the first word to the first word to the first word to the first word for the first word of the first word to the first word for the first word of the first word of the first word of the first word of the first word of the first word to the first time.
So when you hear it thinks -- it's fear, it's fairly the huge.
Not all of my creative process -- I'm not a conducted.
I'm a mul, and my way to work is about the same time is -- wake me to get and work and go into the same orary day and go over and go over and go over and go over again.
But even I was in my head in my head, I was shirt against that thing, in my head, at times.
And I think that even many of you the han it.
You know, even though the work and ideas came to me from a certain source sources would not be unseen.
And what is this thing?
And how can we relate to it in a way we don't do lose the head, but stucky is that you do it?
And as I think about it, the best example of the contemporary example I have is the musicians that I have is a very different years ago for a newspaper.
We were talking about this, and you know, Tom, for the most life of life was the incarnation of the paper is the incarnation of the paper -- and to do that, dominate species of impulsides, and and you know, and the most interiorate species of impulsides.
But then I went down to the way, and one day while he was driving on a car to Los Angeles, changed all of him.
He was going fast, and all a lot of a melodia, which is a little frame, which comes into its head as it does the inspiration, elusive, and the wish -- you know, it's wonderful, and the wish -- you know, it's wonderful, and the wish -- but not how you get it.
It doesn't have a car, a match of paper, it has no register.
So it starts to feel this kind of old old old anxiety to him, "I'm going to lose and remarrusushed by this lost seseedly people.
I don't have enough and I can't do it."
And instead of going to stopped in the panic stop.
And I'll do the whole mental process and did something completely new.
And I just look at the sky and said, "Hey, I don't see what I'm driving?"
"Do you look like a song nove?
If you really want to exist, you get into a more opporter when I can take care of you.
Other of the triments, you to get something.
You go to disturbing Leonard Coonard Cohen."
And his work process changed after that.
Not the work work was even dark as a seed:
But the process of the weigh an's been released when the genius was released when the genius was caused to the genius that was causing it nothing about the problems and free and fresh it back to where he was happening that was not being a whole thing.
but yet this peculier, wonderful, beautiful bizarre collaboration between Tom and this strange thing and the outside thing that was not Tom.
So as I felt that story started to change a little bit the way I was working and already already save me a time.
This idea, I was saved when I was writing "Mangia, Prega, and falls in one of those disperation where we all all when we are working on and we don't start to think that and we can't start to think that that is going to be a worse book that is going to be the worst book that that is going to be the worst book --
Not only bad at the worst book writing.
And I started thinking about throwing this project.
But then I remember Tom he talked to the air, and I tried to us.
So I went to my face on the handultimate and I would say my comments to a room.
And I said, "You know, what you say, "What is going to be bright now, if this book is not going to be very brilliant not to mind, right?
Because as I see that I'm putting us all of that I haven't have to that.
So if you want to be better and you have to introduce your parts.
Okay, but if you don't do it, you know what it is, I don't make it free.
I'm going to go and write the same because it's my work.
And I would like to favor that was recorded that I was to do my own own particip," because -- the end is like, OK, OK, -- centuries in the desert of North Africa people were dancing for the length of the dance of the dances of the walls to the walk and the heba.
And they were always magnificent because the dances were so professionals, and they were fantastic.
But every single one of these artists would be going to do it and one of these artists became actually translent to it.
And I know what I talk about it, because I know that you have seen all of it, in a certain point, a lost way.
It was like the time you stops, and the ballery walked through a kind of portal and was not a different kind of car, as a 1,000 nigh, but all you stay up.
And suddenly it doesn't just look like a human.
But you accese from divince and under the delight-fellow devices.
And when this next time, this next time, people knew what was was, people knew what was was, they were called him with his name.
They were sitting manues, and they started singing, "Allah.Allah, God God, God, God, God, God, God, Go."
That's God, you know,
I was Curious known -- when the Morderer invaser the Spaper -- they took this abitude and the ready one changed in the century of "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, he was the Spapers.
In Spay, when a paper did something impossible and magic is a magic of God, cool, "At the magnified, except -- a flip foundation -- a flower of God.
And it's great, because we need it.
But, the problem comes the day, for the ballery -- the ballery and discover is the 11 in the morning, and the last last of the Martedin the morning.
It's just a mortal with great male to the knee, and maybe not going to be able to be ever to the altie.
And maybe nobody will channe's name, and what does is it have to do with the rest of his live?
It's difficult to it.
This is one of the most painfulation reciliations.
But maybe it doesn't have to be so angotisy if you can not believe it, you know, all the most extraordinary of your being come from you yourself.
But credit just that you have been on a kind of initiable sources of this team of the foundation of your life that you have to go to somewhere else when you have.
And, you know, if we think that in this way it changes.
And so I started thinking, and it's certainly as I thought for several months during the work of the book that I think for several months in the book that I was very followed following my great.
And what I have to keep telling me when I feel electried to be that is, not fairly fair.
Let me just just your job. It's just your work.
He is going to introduce your parts, any of it.
If your work is dance, you dball.
If the divine, I assume to give you a little decide to let me get some kind of wonder, for a only time through your efs, and then "O!"
Over triments, you do the same dance.
And "Oh, no!" And I think it's the same.
I think I think I should teach it.
Or!" And I just just for the human and the tunes and textagges to delive.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: O!
As you know, I talked about some of these projects on the genome of these projects on the genomes.
We're now beginning a new percorso: We started digitalize biology and now starting from that digital code we are both both to a new biology fashion biology, designing and synthesizing and sympts, and by sweeping life.
We have always tried to ask the questions.
"What is the living?" is something that many biological I think have been trying to figure out out of levels.
We have tried a different approach, reducing the minimes of terms of terms.
We're just just just about 20 years ormas.
When we sequenced the human genome was treated to the analogic world of biology to the digital world.
Now we asked our: Can we can regenerate life from this digital universe from this digital universe?
This is the map of a small organism, the Mycoplasma genitalium, which is the species from genome genome between the things that can authorities.
And we tried to reduce the genome to create one more more smaller.
We can get a hundred to heliminate a hundred genes about 500 of the genes of about 500 that are here.
But when we look at the metabolic map to his metabolic map to the note.
So I think it's simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate it, one to the time, it's very unlikely that this can bring into a living cellure.
So we decided that the only way to progression was synthetic to be able to make the covery very very very much to make the components to bring the founding components to bring the fundamental questions.
And so we started the avventure of "Can we can synthesize a chromoso?"
Can the chemistry to produce these big molecules that we haven't been able to create before I hold it?
And in order to make a good chromoso?
A chance is just a piece of chemistry material chemistry.
The speeds we are able to type life is growing up to exponential rhythmity.
Our ability to write the genetic code -- agee, progression and rather slowly, but it's improving it.
And our latest results the bringing up a exponential curve.
We started more than 15 years ago.
And the process required a lot of past -- starting with a bioetic review before we started the early experiments.
But we found that DNA intetizing DNA is very difficult to it.
There are tens of thousands of cars in the world that are small-segment of DNA, the long long long time is 50 letters and it's a degenerative process -- the more than the segment is longer segment is longer than the segment is longer than the longer is going to be a longer degenerative proces:
So we had to develop a new method to assembling these frames and correct the mistake of the mistake it.
And this was our first attempt to start with Phi information of the genome genome of the genome genome of the genome genome of the genome of the genome genome of the genome genome of the genome of the genome of the genome genome of the Phi Thi 17
It's a small virus that kills bacteria.
We designed the fragments, effectivated the reefs and get a molecules of DNA of about about about 5,000 letter of DNA of about 5,000 letter --
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemical material chemistry material and we put it into bacteria and started to read this genetic code and dealing the particles and produced particles.
The viral particles were then release out of your cells, are going back and they have destroyed E.
I talked about recent recent with members of the petrolife's saying that they have certainly comfortable this model.
They have more than you.
We believe that this is a situation where the software can really build his own own biological same hardware in a biological system.
But we wanted to do things bigger things.
We wanted to build the entire bacteria of the bacteria --
It's more than 580 miles lyer code.
So we thought we could build it into the size of viruses of viruses so that we can can change the skills of a living cellula to understand what the components of a living cell.
The design is crucial and if we start with digital information into a computer, these have to be very accurated.
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995, the standard accuratness of a 10 mile mibasis.
We have discovered resequencing that original sequence -- we used that original sequence we would never be able to do it works.
One part of the process is designing segment segment segment segment that are over, with all the other segments of 50 letters to build underunit smaller than working together.
We try to do one one of them here.
You probably have a bed bed that we put the flight.
So I think this is genetic code on four letters: A, C, G, and T.
Three of those letters together code about 20 adminiotic adminiotic deactors, and there's a specific order to reading for every amminoid to a load ad.
So we can use genetic code to write words, thought.
What we did in the beginning was authography.
Some people were dolphuses from the fact that it was not poem.
We have designed these spots to just unize with a fundamental bit.
There are enzimes that repair and they put them up and put it up.
And we started to get to segment segment with five to seven miles in a thousand literally unition, united a way to former segment sitting to their own 124 miles away.
We have a past of these sandwipes in abundance so that we were trying to create a very robate procedge -- as you will see in a minute.
We're trying to automatize the process.
So this looks like the tabellon a basketon of a basketer play.
When we get to these very long segments -- more than 100 miles, more than they will not grow more directly directly in the E.
You get to the limits of modern biology molecule.
So we looked at other mechannels.
We knew another mechanism called homology, which is a homology recombination that in biology is useful to repair the DNA to unize the DNA to unize the chments.
Here's an example.
This organism, this organism, called Deinococcus radio harvest, it can absorsorb three million rad rad radiation.
You can see in the high squaring like his chromosom.
In 12 -- 24 hours comes up exactly how it was before.
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do it.
These organisms can be able to touch completely.
They can live under a vacuum.
I'm absolutely sure life is in space, and you smooth to find new rich environments of water.
And to say the NASA showed that this happens.
This is a picture of the molecule that we've built by using these processes by just using the light-lay design of the design segment of inseries.
The lightly assembly the automatically.
This is not been taken with a electron microscope with a regular, but with a regular.
It's a molecule -- this is a great that we can see it with a slightly read it.
These are pictures that cover a period of six seconds.
This is the publication that we did a little time ago.
It's more than 58,000 letters of genetic code.
It's the biggest molecule of a definitely structure that ever created by man.
It has a 300 million pounds to 300 million.
If we were going to stamp it with a 10 paper per pushing for a 42 pages only to turn this genetic code.
Now, how do we work work? How can we activate them?
Of course, you get a virus is a game by kids.
It's a little bit more complicated when they use bacteria it.
It's simpler even when it's eucarioes like ourselves, as we can just extract the nucleus and inserirl one else, which is basically the process of cloned clon.
In the bacteria the chromosome, it's integrated in the cell, but we recently showed that we are able to do a complete tray trail.
We can can reficate a kind of a microbial kind of microbial species.
The two are all the way men from topis.
We have added a few genes in a way that we could decide what to choose to this chromosoon.
He then brought it into the enzymes in a way to kill all protection.
And when we put it into the cellula was stupending -- and you open our graphic sophisticy -- the new subject chromosome has gone into the cell.
And we were really thought that we couldn't go to the three, but we still have to do it more in there.
This is one of the greatest mechanisms of evolution.
We found that a lot of species have added a second or a third of a third of a kind of a few parts, adding in a thousand new trates.
So who think about evolution as a only gene to evolution as a gene that it doesn't understand a lot of biology.
There are enzymes called restripes of restriptions, is that address digest.
The cromosomed's not a single one of it.
The cellpha--tail that we have inserito-a-up pha-up --
It turns out the other chromosome, and it recognized the other chromosome, and we were going to be able with only the cellula and the new smoos.
It became blue because of the genes that we've been inserved.
And in a short lasses of time, all the characteristics of a kind of go lost and moved to a new species, based on new software that we inserted in the cell.
All the protects are changed, membranes and when we read the genetic code the genetic code is exactly what we have transfed.
Now, this may look like genetic alchemics, but altering software are DNA to change things in a kind of substantial.
Now, I already explained that this is not about genesis -- but progress from three million and a half million and a half of evolution, and I said that maybe we're maybe to create a new version of Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosion process.
Why do I do that?
I think it's enough of course when we think about our needs.
We're going to go from six and a half billion people in the next 40 years.
Just to give you an example: I was born in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for each one existing in 1946; 40 years, there will be four of them will be four.
We're going to have a lot of time to find food, water and drink and drink for six and a half billion people.
It's going to be even harder to do it for nine billion.
We use more more than five billion carbon co-billion-shoulder than 30 billion barrels.
That means a hundred million barrels a day.
When we try to find biological processes or any kind of process to replace them, they will be a huge challenge challenge to me.
We have to have to have the CO2 emission of these materials that end up in the atmosphere.
Once today, because of the scientific discoveries around the world, we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I like to think that are designed for the future.
The electronic electronic industry is only a dozen about components, and think about how many different things are come out of it.
Our limits here are principly, and our imagination.
We now have techniques to these rapid metoes of sympts, can be able to create what we call combinator.
We can build a big robots that can produce a million robots a million chromosomes a day.
Think of process, these 20 million genes or to try to optimize the processes to produce either or drugs or new vaccines, we can change, so much vaccines, and we can change now now now that in the last 20 years of science.
And it's just a standard selection.
We can choose to survive, chemistry or carbon dishing or carbon vaccines etc.
This is an instantanea of software programmed that we're working to be able to sit and design species to the computer.
Well, we don't know how they would be a year.
We know exactly what their genetic code genetic code.
We're now focusing on fourth generation.
You also saw you that you can get them ethanol from the grass.
We have coal carbon on on on the third generation that will come up enough soon as the upper coal sugar as the either as the either either as a either or different kinds of thrown --
But the only way the biology can have a great impact without increasing impact with increasing food and limiting the cost of food and limiting the degree of food and we can get this purpose -- we are working to design that we can get this purpose and get this out of the fourth generation in about 18 months.
The sunlight combined with CO2 is a method -- but in our discoveries around the world, we found different methods.
This is an organism that we described in 1996.
It lives in the ocean is about 2,500 feet of the water temperature of the water.
It creates from CO2 using hydrogen molecular hydrogen molecular sources.
We are trying to figure out if we can inch CO2, which can easily be transportated by tubes, converting that CO2 in carbon in carbon to drive this process.
So we can think we might be able to increase what the basic question is, "What is the life."
Eastly. If you can't do it from TED, where can you do it?
It would be a main main function source source source source sources.
And we are working on the same method to use the same methods to create vaccines to create the instantanes.
You saw this year with flu flu and we are always back, and with a dollar, at least when it's about to find the right vaccine.
I think that what you can change in combinable vaccines in antical.
And that's how the future could start to be changing, the tree of evolution, accelerating evolution with bacteria and across, and the ended hair.
We are so so much from improving people.
Our purpose is to do a way of living enough to try to do that. Thank you very much.
But first of all I'm going to show you the fastest possible, a little bit of fundamental job that we took the Microsoft in following a year a pretty much a year ago ago this is Seadragon.
It's a local environment that you can interact with a local amount of visual data that I remote with a huge amount of visual data here.
Here we're seeing a lot of gigabyte from a kind of digital pictures with a kind of sustain, and continue, for a speeds, and so that we want to be the images like it.
And it doesn't matter how much the amount of information that we see, how big the amount of data or the images.
Most are all digital photographs, but this is a provenient scanning from the Library of Congress, and reenters in the legal of Congress, and reenters in the 300 megapixel.
It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that the prestations of a system like this is the number of pixel on your screen in any moment. It's also a very flexible architecture in any moment.
This is a whole book of data not images.
This is Dickens. Every Wonny is a chap. Every colonna represents a capitula.
And to show you that it's just about testing and not images, we can do something like this, to do something like this, to actually do something that is a real representation of the head, not a picture.
It could be a little artificial way to read a little electronic book.
Don't make the advice.
This is a more realistic. It's a number of the Guardian number.
Every image is the beginning of a century of a selection.
And it really gives you the pleasure of read the real version version of a magazine or a five-type or a five-type or a lot of kinds of meeting.
We also did something with the corner of this number in particular.
We created a high-resolution advertising advertising -- much more than what you use in a normal commercial published -- and we inserted contain extra.
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobiles, you can see here.
Or other models, or even specific specifics.
And this really shows some of these ideas to heliminate the limits space on the screen.
We hope this lady to put a pop-up to the pop-up pop-up and sexual pop-up to it.
Of course, the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology.
And on this I don't want to lose time, if I don't say that we have contributed to give it in this field.
These are all the streets in the U.S. is a geospatial image of NASA.
So now we're going to go down to something else.
This is now now from the living on the webs; you can go to see it.
This is a project called Photosynth, which fights two different technologies.
One is Seadragon and the other is a very interesting visual computer to very interesting computer very interesting to do a very interesting student of Washington, with the aid of Washington, with the aid of Microsoft and of Rickesearch. A lot of the Microsoft Research. It's a great collaboration.
And it's from the living web, managed to Seadragon.
You can see it when we do this kind of screen that we can go from one and have this kind of a picture of the other kind of solution is the multiply.
But the space collection of the images here has actually a meaning.
The algorithms of the computers have recorded these pictures together, so that they rerespond to the real real places.
I don't know if I have time to show you some other environment.
There are a lot more space.
I want to spend a directly to one of the original data of Noahs -- and this comes from a previous prototynthetic Photosynththosynthosynthosynthosynthe, in fact, the Photosynth. And it's not necessarily so much evident to look at the environments that we have in the environments that we have in the environments that we've put in the website.
We had to worry about legal aspects and so forth.
This is a reconstruction of Notre-Cathedral of Notree Dame in Flickr. Basta Flickr and you get images of make, and you get images of the camps. Every very single wisise. Every one of these arms represents a picture that it has been discovered to this model.
So they're all taken from Flickr and were all related to space this way.
And it's possible to navigate this simple way.
You know, I would never have thought of finish to work for Microsoft.
It's very gratificing this kind of a branches here.
I think you can see that it's a lot of different kinds of fotoitude photos to those professional -- SLR, a a very significant number of meaning, in this environment.
And if I can do that, I try to try to look for those more strangers.
Many are are blocked by factors, etc.
Something is a series of photographs -- there it is a series of photographs.
This is a poster of Notred.
We can go from the physics view of this environment.
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment. This is now taking data from everyday -- from collective inter, from collective interaction of how the earth, from visual point of view -- and connects to all of data together.
All those pictures become connected together, greater than the sum of the sum of the sum of the sum of the sum of the sum of the sum of the sum of the sum of the sum of the sum of the sum of the sum of the sum of the sum of the sum of the sum of the sum of the sum of the sum of the sum of the sum of the sum of the sum
You have a model of the earth of the earth that we have a model of the earth of the earth of the earth of the earth of the earth of the earth of the earth of the earth of the earth of the earth of the earth of the earth that you have a ground.
Think about this as a promote as a promote as a promote to the earlier.
It's something that growth in complexity as people are using it, and the advantage that people are useful for the use.
Their pictures are marked with metadhits from other people.
If you go to the idea of conduct all of these sants says, my names of the Notreal cattattedral. Fame of suddenly resses and all of those data, and I can use as a kind of sending point to the space in that space, and you use the photos of anybody else and get a lot of red red and cross-model cross-mooth and use experience of a kind of red from the cattattedge and and
Of course, a consequence of all of this is very highly elaborate processed by every interesting part of the earth, recovery not only by sees and satellitaries and satellite pictures and satellite picture.
Mill.
Chris Anderson: I understood good? What is your software will will be able to do is that to be a certain point, in the next photographs -- all of the interconnecting to anyone in the world or be practically connected to it?
BAA: Yes.
It's creating hyperlink, if you want to do hyperlink, you know, between images.
And it's doing it in the bottom of the images.
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about wealth of the seeds of the seed-of-information that many images.
As a research of images on the web, you know, a fruit and the text on the page page of photos.
Now, what happens if that picture you connect all your picture?
So the amount of seedity interconnection, and the amount of wealth that is really enormous about it is really enormous effect. It's a classical classical effect.
CA: Blaise, it's really incredible.
BAA: I thank you very much.
One of the pleasure of the pleasues when you travel and one of the ethnographic research is the living between who not forget the antic antic antic antic antic and traditions, in the wind, today, the today, the sleeps in the wind, today, the flowing into the plants that is in the flowers and loving the plants of plants.
You know, the way of the Jaguar travel even beyond the Milky Lattea, or that the elders of old Inuit are still significant meanings, or that in Himalaya, the buddistes still follow the back of the Dhar, and the idea that the world in which we live in absolutely remaintain a sense of reality, but it's just a model reality model reality, but it's just a model reality,
the consequence of a particular adaptative choices that our stirs have done, good or male or male -- a lot of generations ago.
And, of course, we all share tracts.
We all hidden it.
We are subject to remaination.
We have to deal with the inexorability of death and so we don't surprise and balance.
We all have an art.
What it turns out is the particular rhythm of the cang of the dance of every culture.
It doesn't matter that they are the Penan forests of Borneo, or the Haiti, or the Haiti, or the Haiti, or the desert Kaid in Kenya secentries in Sepentries Curander's heart in the heart of the Sahara.
He was my journey company in the desert a month ago, or a month ago, or a yaaaa-hand and the mother of the world.
All of these people are teaching us that are other ways to think about existing ways of thinking, other ways of thinking, other ways of moving in the world.
And if you reflect, it's a concept that can give you hope.
Inside, the cultures of the world creating a spiritual life and cultural life that makes the spiritual and cultural that avavavavailable to the planet and it's important for the well-being like biosphery.
And you can think of this cultural razing as a ethnosphery and you can define the etnosphery of all the concepts, myths, ideas, inspirations, inspirations, inspirations, inspirations, inspirations, brought into the human imagination of the consciousness.
The etnosphere is the amazing pathriage of humanity.
It's the symbol of what we're and what we can be in how much as a kind of quisities.
And because biosphere is quite very quickly consumed as much as it was as a local as a lose as quickly.
No biologist, for example, would say that 50 percent of all the species is about the earlier of the existing of the earlier -- in the pocalitty -- in the field of the biological diversity -- and you don't get to even a little bit of the cultural ipocalitty -- that of cultural diversity.
The indicate of this is, of course, the los;
When you're born 6,000 lings, this planet.
a language is not only only from a vocabulary or a series of gramatical.
One is the price of the spirit.
It's the middle of which the animation of every culture.
Every language is a forest of the mind, a spiritual ecosystem system.
And of those 6,000 languages, as we are sitting in Monterey, at least half of the time is not more sweeping in the ears of the kids.
They don't get more teacher to the kids, which means to less you get anything, which is already dead.
What is a more tristage of being the silence, of being the last to talk to a language, of not to get the saggem of the adhaunting of the addition or of anticipate the promise of the kid?
This is a little bit of somebody in the world every two weeks of the world every two weeks and a laughing dies and brings with the last few weeks of a language --
And I know somebody will say, "Isn't that better than that?
The world would not be a better place if we were all the same language?" Benis: How do we talk all yoruba.
We talk about kogis.
You will will be going to be able to talk about not to talk about their language.
I would like to do a journey through the etnosh --
a little journey in the etnosphery to give you a above what we're lost on.
Many of us forget that when I say, "different ways of existing in existing ways of exists.
We take it for example this Barasana, in Amazon Sepentrial baby that creates to provide from the law rivers of revening from the lay river.
It's a population that is not able to distinguish, the blue color blue because the time is the celests of the forest, which is identified in the forest, which depends the population of the forest, which depends the popul.
They have a strange language and a matriage rule rule, said, "Hoogamics -- you have to marry one person who talks about a different language.
And all of that has rooted in the miteck past the particular is that in these extese families that are about six or seven lings, because of the mysteries in the mysteries of the mysteries in the mysteries of a language.
They are just listen to and then they start to talk about.
We take one of the most interesting tribes with which I lived Waorans of Ecuaors, the Waorans of the nords, a incredible population that had the first contatts in 1958.
In 1957 mission and they had tried a factory facting.
They took down to the high photographs that they were very very much of the phones, dimental load that this population of pluvial forest, dimentioned that this people of pluvial raze.
They collected the pictures from the ground or a shape or a shape or a shape or a figar and they didn't find that they were diavoluum, and they killed five mission with the laws.
But Waorans don't kill the stranies.
They kill in them.
Fifth percent of death was caused by their own themselves.
We have been rising up to eight generations and we found two of natural death and when we insisted it to know that one of them was agreed that one of them was agreed to invecking, and then they killed it itself.
The hunters were able to recognize the urine urine from 40 steps and recognize the species.
In the early 1980s, I was assigned a really interesting job when my professor of Harvard was asked me if I wanted to go to Haiti to be sweeping in the basis of Duves' power of Duves: and Momewer Macoes, and I impossessed to do the shombies.
To make sense of a miracle I would have to understand the Voodoo culture.
It's quite a little bit of a metaphor vision of the world.
Very interesting.
If I asked you to tell you the big religions of the world, what would I say?
Cristian: Islam, Buddismo, Ebraism, Ebringing it.
One continent is always left out of the sub-Saharan Africa has no religious religious Africa has no religious ft. And instead of the Voodoo -- it's not the distilled of these religious religious concepts.
What makes the voice is the intense of the door is the intense relationship between life and death and death you.
So you live the spirits.
Even the spirits can be invocated by the Grande Aqua, and they replace to the dance of the dance and temporary temporary animals in a very short activity that for a brief activity becomes the following is the dead.
So this is the voodooists like "You want to go to close to speak about God.
We give it in the time and become God."
And from the moment, you're a poss; it's the spirit that you guy, you can do it?
So it is to these incredible events -- following your voice door in the state of trancy that touch you emptize tizing a rather demonstration of the mind on the body when you catallow in a state of extreme when they catalized in a state of extremely extreme cities.
And in all the people who who I lived the most extraordinary Kogi Kogi of Sierra Nevada Santa Marckin Santa Cholombia secentries.
It turns out the grain the ancient civilization that once lived on caraibes of Colombia in attempt that the people would reach on the load to the vulcanic mass that would be on the vulcanic floor.
In a blood continent -- this people have never been conquisted by the shagnothing.
Once today, they're governed by a cler but their formation is decided.
The young people following are taken by the family to three or four years, and live secreating in a world of good and homberry secreating in a world of hombergone up to the basic basic basic ice for 18 years.
Two period of nine years choices proposited to reduce the nine months of management that spend in the uteration of the uterically in the uteration of the uteration of the uterads.
For this time, they get accultured to their push and their prayers who who are preserving their prayers and only prayers and their prayer -- or to say the cosmic equilibrium -- or to say the ecological balance.
At the end of this incredible initiation, they suddenly took and for the first time in life in their lives, at age age of 18 years, see a treatment of consciousness of the first belong -- when the sun is the sun and the sun is all of the beautiful fair, all of his own springed in theory is conference.
"Right? I just want you to it.
It's stumbling. It's now to you protect it."
They call that the greatest brothers and say that we we, threats are the destruction of the world.
This level of intuition is extremely important.
When we think of Indian populations and we invote Rousseau and the old story of the noble history of the noble history of the noble now-by-unch in the simple or maybe in the simple or maybe in the Earth is closer to the Earth are closest in us.
The Indian population is not the feeling ners from our own ouralgies.
There is no space for these things in the malaries of the Hibet, or in the gelides of the Tibet, but because of the time and rited, they created a mystic of Earth is not about the concept of being aware of the Earth consciousness -- but on a very well more subtle subtle of human consciousness can only be because it's a human consciousness from human.
What does that mean?
It means that a girl of the And And And who grows up to the mountain is a spirit that is going to be a deep human being being deep and a very different relationship with the mountain or a very different relationship with the mountain or a very different rounded with the mountain and a mountain a mountain a mountain a mountain a shelter that is a shelter of rock that a mountain a sh.
which is the death of a spirit or a mineral core is irrelevant.
What is interesting is the metaphor is that defines the relationship between individual and the natural world.
I grew up in the forests of the Chritain's Columbia credate forest to be cut.
And this is a human being being a different from my friends who believe that the forests are dimora dia death of Hukukuk and the beat the wood, and the beat the beat the wrists and the spirits that live in the world, the beat the north world, spirits that we deal with the Huk's ination.
If you start to look at that these cultures can actually start to understand some sense, you can start to understand some of their sense-discovered discovers.
I took this picture to open the Amazon Amazon Amazon Amazon Western Amazon Amazon --
Maybe some of you have heard of the ayahuas, the most powerful psycoactive respot.
What makes it fascinating the ayahuas's potential is not the potential for the functional of the substance, but its processing. It's composed to two elements.
From a lian lian lian unknocks that is a series of cocarbols, harmine and harms, and hardly launogens.
And by by by by by by by making a bunch that it alters a little bit of consciousness that it is measured by a little bit of coffee family -- vired by a coffee of coffee.
This plant is powerful powerful triptamines, very similar to serotonine, dimethoxyltrypt-5, methoxyltrypt.
If you ever see the Yanomami Yanomami to the hidden birth that they do from a species, anchech of species, anchecoxymethoxyptamines.
Tiring that pole on the hidden is a little bit like being disappeared by a slopines and landing on a sea of electricity. Risat. Risat. It's not a distorsion of reality.
I was often with my professor, Richard Evan Shultes, the man who has taken the psychological fungal fungi in the 1900s in the 1900s in the 190s, in the 190s in Mexico.
And I think my text can not be classified these triamines because if you're done not going to be hallucinated.
It's possible to assume only if you put on other substances with other substances that denized the MAO.
Now it's the beauty beta-carboline that are starting in this book, are inbits of MAO, the same kind of necessary triptamines. The question is going to be able to be able to be two deaths -- how these people are doing that are going to be two deaths -- how these people are going to find a biochemical version that is dangerous sum that is dangers?
We use the great euphemism of proof and the mistake that can reveal infrutted.
But if we ask Indians, they will tell us "Look at the plants talk."
What does that mean?
This tribes -- Cofan, has 17 variety of ayahuase, which distinguished in the forest, and that our eyes would come into the same species.
If we ask him how they were their pocksons, they will tell us how to be able to stay of plants, the rest I don't know everything?" I said, "No."
The solution is, you take 17 variety in a night of the slens and each one will channel.
And with this is not Harvard, but it's much more interesting than contain that you know.
Now, [[applausi] the problem is that the ones that have to the people who are going to be painting them but somehow you reduced them to the margin history of our real real world and goes to the margin history of our real real world and will go to it.
In fact, the XX century, 300 years, not will be reminded to his wars or its technologies or its technologies that but rather like the was where we stopped and actively very much as we were stopped and actively accepted. And now the problem is not change.
All cultures through the centuries have been involved in a dance to new life chance of life.
And the problem is not technology.
Indians have not being Siouxyoux when they put it on the cock and fresh as Americans have not to be Americans when they put away from the horse and calyxies.
It's not the change or technology that threats the integrity of etnosfer. It's the poter.
The last fly of the domination.
And if you give a look at the world, you will find that these are not destined culture.
It's living creatures and dynamics and push dynamics that are beyond their own adaptations.
And I'm disboard, which is disbodishing in the pathric of Penan:
a population of Sarawak, in the sound of the Sarasian who lived in the forest to a generation ago, and now reduced to a generation -- and now reduced to the revenues on the rivers of the rivers of the rivers of the books that seems to be on the Bornem Cinese Meria, where navi bladvertising Meridial's Cinese Merias the Japanese Merizon Cinese Cinese Meria.
You are going to report the stock with the layer to the forest.
Or, in Yanomami, are the diseases that have come to the discovery of the gold.
If we move on the Tibet, and if I'm doing a lot of research, you will see the hard fly flight-political domination.
As you know, the genocide the genocide extinction of a popular popular level, but the destruction of a popular popular style, the destruction of a popular popular popular style, because it does part of developed strategy of development.
And you can't understand the suffering.
I lost the 6,000 miles from Chengdu in China in China in China in South South East Lhasa with a young line, but only came to Lhasa young line, but only came to Lhasa I realized what is behind the statistics that we feel talking about.
6,000 monuments in the policy reduced and energy.
1.2 million people killed by military military in the Cultural.
The father of this guy was ascrited to Panchen Lama.
which means that it was killed at the Chinese invasion of Chinese invasion Chinese invasion of Chinese invasion --

The Tibet of Tibet can be inable, but the spirit the recover.
At the fin the end of the ending choices.
We want to live in the world's world of the monothony or we want to collect the policy world of diversity?
The big ancropologist Margaret Mead, before we die told that his greatest fear was that, in our own friend's greatest fear of the world, not only see the whole legal legal legs of human imagination -- we will get us from a modance of thinking, but a day we can get out of a dimental issue that was going to be able to be able to do that they were all other possibility.
And it's humiliating to remember that our species is existed for 600,000 years.
And Neoliter's rewards us -- which has been detected to detect the culture of the seed-bed culture, re's poetry with the classroom and by the classroom and we talk about 10,000 years ago.
The modern world industrialized has been 300 years.
That sharks a story I don't suggests that we have the answers to all the challenges that we have to deal with in the millennia.
When to these cultures of the world cultures of the world is asked what it means to be human, they respond to 10,000 different voices.
And it's in these answers that we all have risking the chance to be what we are. We are going to make a kind of consciouss, that has to make all the people and the giving the giving out of the giving you a lot of optimism.
I took this picture of the north north of the North island of Baffin, when I went to the Inuit, and this man, Olaya, he told me the wonderful story of his grandmother.
The government canadese was not always gentles, with the people in the 1950s to stabilize our sounds to our sounds in colonies.
The grandfather of this man refused to go up.
The family for his life, he took all of his life, he took all of his carms, and all of its attentials.
You have to know that the Inuit don't temes the free of it.
The slits of the slits were made of fishing paces were made of fish.
The grandfather of this man didn't do it by the art night or night or the basis that are suffering or the basis.
It's suncharioled the pantalons in their hands.
He prayed on the side, of this game of cacces and when I was solid and when I was solid -- he killed a dog.
He sushed the dog and created a brille, with the cassroom and created a slittle, and it has uncompared to another dog and and disappeared on the bank band.
We want to talk about horse? [Risat] [Risat] And that, in different ways, [Applausilience of the Inuit and all the Indian population and all the Indian population of the world.
In the 19191919ed, 1999 government canadese has released to Inuit and the Texas a larger territorial territories and Texas mas I put together.
It's their new pathy. It's called Nunavut.
It's a very independent territory of all the minerary resources.
I mean, I can stay for a nation-state of a nation-state can recognize with his people.
And finally, I think it's quite obvious, who is at least who of us was in these remote areas of the planet, you know, they're not remote remote remote to be very very of.
For somebody is home.
They represented the sections of humans that are rising up to the days, and for all of these kids, like our kids, like our children, they become part of our kids, become part of our children, become part of the hope.
So we end up to the National Geographic we are convincing that politicians will never come to anything.
We believe that polempowered polemy --
[[Applausian is not persuasive, but we believe that stories can change the world, and maybe we may be the best institution's stories of the world. Every month our website.
156 countries transmit our television channel.
Our magazes are reading from millions of people.
Our work is travel to ethnosphere to bring our public in places that are going to be wondered by which are gaps to be able to be able to be a little bit of the central reveals, and then they will go to the central revealing of the different life in a pluralist and multicultural red. And multicultural red.
where the wisdom of all the people can contribute to our collective.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope is to call other than other than you already heard and try to dead some connections in the case not borders.
I want to start with what I call "the dog."
The dog's offic?
The dog's officer of all the West dog's Western officer officer and the real officer officer "The way to be of our citizen." "The way to do it is to be able to detect the individual."
The reason is is a late, in the fact that freedom is in itself a value, is very very valuable for humans.
On the other is the fact that if we are free, each of us can act to do everything that massive to do everything that massive -- without any deciding to the wild in the name of ourselves.
The way to massive way the freedom is to be massive choices.
More people people are more free, and more and greater is their freedom, more hours is their freedom, more hor is their well-being.
This is a remarkable to be a rooted in societi' society that nobody would be dream.
And it's also deeply deeply in our lives.
I'll show you some examples of what progress has recommen.
This is my supermarket. It's not very big.
I lost a simple note on conditions.
In my supermarket is 175 conditions, without contact the 10 variety of olive olive olive and the 12 balloes that you can buy to a lot of constance to the pushing number of constance that nobody of the 175 ready to be a huge amount of constant constant to your degree with a little bit of your degree --
Here's what the supermarket.
And then you go to the electronic store, to buy a stere: CD, radio, reader, plast, reader, plast, legacy.
And in this single store, there's a big audience.
We can do six million and a half of different combinations using the components that there are in a only negoti.
You need to put that there is a lot of choices.
Other fields -- the world of communications.
Once time, when I was a kid, you could get all the phones, pat the phones, that they were fornitrow from mamma Bell.
He was known the phone, you didn't buy it.
One consequence of that, in the way, was that the phone is that the phone is not a make.
These days are gone.
We have a lot of variety of telephone variety of the cellular phone --
Here's the future.
My favorite is that in the middle, reader MP3, cut up of the birth of the bird, and forward crasses me the brule.
If you don't have seen it in the store, you're not seen it in the home, you're pretty well certain that will be going to get it.
And what is the end is that people in the stores and ask this question. And you know what the answer is, "No."
It's not possible to buy a cellphone that doesn't do too many things.
So, in other aspects of life that are much more important than waters of the waters of choices.
Look at health is not going on on the United States that you go from the doctor, and the doctor, what you have to do.
Instead, you go from the doctor, and the doctor, and the doctor, or B" "Hey, you have these benefits and risk "Be has these benefits and risks. What do you want to do with the risks. What do you want to do that?"
And he said, "Dr. Dr. What would I do that?"
And the doctor, "At this doctors and these risks and By bits and Brits has these skills.
"What do you want to do that?"
And you rebit, "Dr. if she was me, what do you do to do that?"
And the doctor, "But I'm not lei."
The result we call the ""malator "malator of malato," it turns it does it look like that.
But it is actually not a smoke and the responsibility of decisions by somebody who knows something, which is doctor, and there's no doctor, and so it is not not -- and so that it is not that in the ideal condition.
There is a huge massive marketing of drugs products, and I would say, if you think about it, you think that if you think of not a sense, because we can't buy it.
But if we don't buy them, why are we buying them with them
The answer is that they want to do that doctor, we call the doctor.
And so fundamental thing as is our orate now is a question of choice, as you see in this way, "We don't want to force the kids. We don't want to be baby. We don't want to be a kid. We don't see more identity."
And we can reinvention us how many times we can get us how many times us will be reinvented us.
That means that every morning, in the risky of person is to decide that kind of person wants to be.
And in the family and matririmonium and matried, a time perspective, and it was that there was a little bit more prestant, and it was going to start up the most preme possible.
The only real choice was with chemicals -- not when I don't know, and I don't even what do to do later.
Once day, it's really really to play with play.
I mean, I can go to a very smart, and I do 20 percent of work than a time.
And because they're not very brilliant because they're less diligents.
but because I'm implemented to ask him, "Where would I have to marries or no?
"Would I have to think before you the kids or care?"
They're interrogatives roring now.
And they try to answer these questions, even if this implemented not completing the companies that assumption, and not get a good vote to my exame.
And they have to do it. It's very important question.
Now, the job: we're lucky, like Carl subtoliner, because technology allows us to work every minute, every day, from every day, from the Hotel Randolin:
And in parents, there's a corner, and I'm not going to tell you anybody what the WiFi works.
I don't say that I want to use it.
What is that incredible freedom of choice that we have about the work of the work? Is that we have to work on the moment, if we have to work or not.
We can go to see our kid play, with the cellular cellular mobile phone in a pocketry and the notebook -- typically, about the knee.
And even though they're all shots, every minute that we see our son, and we also asking, "Do I have to answer this call?"
"I have to answer this email? I have to emboy this literate late this letter?"
And even when the answer is "no," all this makes the experience of the parent of your son, very different than what would be in other conditions.
So, from any part of the look, and big things and all of these things and all of life, life is a question of choices.
Once the world was this: Ovver, there were some possibilities, but it was not a chance of choices.
The world is really like this: The world is the dilemma is, "Is it a good thing, or negative thing, or negative thing, or negative thing, or negative thing, or negative?
The answer is Sunce.
The positive laughing all of the negative lies. So I'm going to talk about the negative ones that are negative lies.
All of this choice behaviors on the same kind of negative effects on people.
The first one, paradoxy, is that it produces instead of freation.
With many options between the payers that you choose it becomes very difficult to do it.
I give you a significant example of the volunte: a study conducted study of volunteer pensions.
And a connect my colleagued data from Vanguard, the giant deep society of depension, with about a million pushing math in 2,000 companies.
What she found is that for every 10 solutions that are offered in more -- the percentage of exhihihibition is scene scene scene scene scene of 24 percent.
With 50 sources are 10 percent in less than deaths when they're available to only have 5. Why?
Because with 50 sources in which the choods, is very difficult to decide and choice comes to the questions.
And I was still questions, and I wonder questions, and of course, questions, and I won't get it.
You know, you know that it means that these old workers are going to be food because they will not have enough money -- they also want to say that decision is so obsticle founds of complementary data.
Not participation, they're losing to 5,000 dollars for year from the dator of the data, which would be good to be deep to severe.
So the paralysis is a consequence of having too much choices.
And I think it makes the world like this.
And finally, for the eternity: keterniter, senapes or maine?"
You would just take the right decision if it's for eternity, right?
You don't want to choose the wrong bottom wrong, and you know,
So this is the first effect. The second is that even if we can avoid paralysi, and we end up to the end of how we were undabove the result of how you would be been to less options between the options that you choose to it.
And this for different reasons.
One of these is that with a lot of conditions, and it's not perfect, it's easy to imagine that you could have a different choices that would be better to imagine that you would have to be better choice. And what happens is that the alternative imagined us by the alternative imagined us and remitting the remise of the decision of the decision of the decision of the decision of the decision that was going to be better than decision,
even when it was a good decision.
More choices are very easy to details that you can any details that is insoundly income.
And then there's what economists call it cost-cost economists call cost-opportunity.
Dan Gilbert has a very good stamattine as the value that we depends on what we depend on the confrontier.
Del rest, when you have a lot of options as we can do is to represent the alternative cars of alternative alternative and less soddiscised of the option that is choices.
Here's an example. I'm going to get all of the people who are not in New York.
But that's what you probably think about it.
There is this Hamptons.
A place of the luse.
Supupons of splendid. It's all for them.
It's not a morning. But what he thinks is this: Well, malediption, it's Agstod."
My neighbors in Manhattan is alive.
"I could just talk about front of home."
And it spends two weeks with the idea that it's losing -- every day -- the chance to park where it wants.
The cost-income cost-chance of the relief, for what we have, even when the choice was excellent --
And the most are options that we have to look at the more the options are going to come back against the opportunity.
Here's another example.
This is a little bit about it a lot of things.
It is about the living moment, and maybe live slowly.
But the most important point is that whatever you choose to not do the others.
The things that we don't choose is a lot of attractive attractive what we do.
Third point: The spiral growing of waits.
I tried it on my skin buying a new jeans.
I just just just go to the jeans.
Once the jeans were just like, buy them and go out and go out and go out and they were swest, only after you took them a life and washed a lot of times, starting to go good.
So I went to buy a couple of new when the old people had gone and said, "I'm going to need a couple of jeans, this is my tam."
The committed me -- "You want slim fit, fit, fit, fashion fit, fit, and fit do?"
You want to do the cernier or with the bottonies? "Hehed." or "acid" or "acidhed."
"Would you like the road?"
"Would you like to the blake or close? Ble --
I was united, and after a little bit of a little bit of -- I could do this kind of -- that was the only one typic." He had no idea what it was like, for a hour jeans, and then I went out from the negoties, with the best story, with the best story, with the best of the negoties, with the best --
It was the male of it. With all that I got the better.
But I felt a worse.
Why? I wrote a book to understand it.
The reason I was worse is that with all that choice was that with all that choices were altis; the jeans had to be perfect.
At the beginning I had expectancy. I didn't expect to anything exceptional when it was just a typical one, at least one guy had to be perfect.
What I had watched was good -- but not perfect.
After I was a chose I was income, I was income, in confronted confront.
The addition of options in the life of the people don't make it increased to the options that these are respected to the options of the options of the options itself.
And this will be less soddisfation, even when the results are good for it.
Nobody in marketing world if it makes it matter.
Because if I knew it is that I am talking about.
The truth looks more like this.
"He's better when he was worse the reason that was better when it was worse when it was worse is that when it was worried about evolutionary advanced evolution.
Once day, in the world we live -- opulent industrialized citizens with the expectation of perspective, the most people who are expectation to be expectation of expectations --
You'll never be surprised because your expectations because your expectations, my expectations, and they are ingigantites.
The secret of happiness -- what you're here -- is "Basashion ways, """Yes, I want to me."
I mean, a little authorographic moment, which are really married and my wife is really stumy.
I couldn't do better, I didn't do better, I didn't have to do better.
But you get it is not always a good thing.
Finally, a consequence of buying a couple of jeans smoods when there is only that jeans is that when you're not satis; and you ask you "Why?
Who is responsible? The answer is clear.
The world is responsible. What could I do about it?
When there are hundreds of jeans, and you buy a insoddisfacent, and you ask you who is responsible for the responsible for you is very clear that the responsible responsible for you are you.
You could do better.
With hundreds of variety available variety of the insuccess.
So when people take decisions, even if the result is valize, they feel uncomfortable and damage it to their own itself.
In the last few years depression is exploded in the industrialized world industrialized the industrialized world.
I think a significant factor -- not the only important -- of this hondrugs of this hondate depression because standards are too much deluent to be too high
And when they need to explain this situation thinks that colpy is them.
So the final result is that in general we're better, but we feel worse.
Let me remember you.
This is the dog, the offical, what we all take for good and it's completely fail.
There is no doubt that a little choice is better than that you don't have to have any long, but from this is better than a little choice is better than a little choice is better than a little choice is better than a little choice is better than a bit.
There's a critical value value val. I don't know what it is.
But I'm sure we have overcome from a piece of the chose choices improving our life.
Now, from the political point -- I have almost finished -- from the policy point of view policy is the follow.
What it allows all this choice in industrial society is the wealth matter.
There are many places in the world, and you know about it, in which the problem is not that they have too much choices.
The problem is that they have too much a little bit of it.
So the factory factory that I'm talking about is a mality of moderns, rich societies.
And what it does is depress and angry is this: Steve Levitt you about how the costs and seats seats seats for bimbes are inusely. It's a lot of money.
I mean, these choices, complicated and dispendious, it's not just inusels.
They're just deleterious to be deleteries.
They make worse.
If a little bit of what in our societies would be reverted in the society was reverted in the people have too much chance to improve it is going to be just their life as well.
This is what economists call a paretyan improvement parety.
a redistribution of redition is good for all -- not only to the poor the poor -- because of this choice in a very except that it would be very good for us.
And I would end up -- "Food, you can become all of what I want, "Food,
Voics, people of culture, thinking, "What makes that fish?"
It's obvious that you can't make anything in a vetrow of vetrow."
"A fallstry imagination of the world's ...
and I anches it for it -- I got it in the beginning.
But then, I think about it, I realized that that fish the long long time.
Because the reality of the fact is that if you send the mouse of the mous, in a way that "everything is possible." You can't get freedom.
If you break the mouse in a way that all you can decrease the relief.
Try the paralysis, and you reduce the benefit to it.
Everybody needs a sphere.
This is almost certainly too stretch to the fish and maybe even fish for us.
But the absence of some symbolic symbolic symbolic symbolic symbolic symbols.
Thank you very much.
