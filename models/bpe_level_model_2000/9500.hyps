The year year, I showed these positive demonstrate that the heath totally three million years of years has had the size of 48 million years has had the size of 48 mistates of 40 percent.
And this under of this under the gravity of the problem of the problem of the ice.
The run lacial arty is in a sense, is a sense, the heart of the climatical climatical climb system climatical system of the climatical climatical climatical climatical climb is a global sense, is in a sense, the climatical climate the critical calculate system.
It was expands and invers and they red.
The next dealies will be a reefy of the last 25 years.
The gaacus have drawed in the rese.
As you see it in the blue blue of the blue well as well as well as well as well as you see it.
And this is the ice, which is the really, that they red.
You can see that the cosid-told hyel, five years or floor years or the sanks, which is like the sky-de-de-de-hand-de-hand-hand-hand-hand-hard told hune of the body else of the corn, which is like the sun.
In 25 years is spent from there, like this.
This is a problem because the interested in the ocean to the ocean art-rescale in the ocean arty where there are enormous amount of carbon ely, they get to put in the midddle of microbs.
Rispacing to the totality of the atmosphere from the global atmosphere would be double to the global point of the point of the point of the ininded.
In some laghi of the deeper in Alaska he's rebobooks is rebobows from water.
The professor, Katey Walter of the University of the University is recated with a team of a team that horinver.
Video: Wow! Al Gore: Le's e's got the question.
A motivating motivation is that this environment of the north, the Greenland from the north.
This is a glacime glacial.
The ported has never been reached levels of the six million people.
This is the Kangerlushed in the southern of the Greenland of the Greenland
If you want to know how to smom to the levels to get to the sky of the levels on the levels the source the mare.
These corrents are increasing to the right.
Another the other side of the planet -- the largest block of the planet.
The months of the scientists have dichied that the launched that the bunch is in negative glacive in the West and the West and some of some hydrops on some of the inindly inaround.
Every quite soulder the water of water in the road.
Some'Himalaya, the largest block of the ilove of the iloss of years aghs, who were glacia.
40 percent of the world's population of the world's population from what I mean.
On And: this glaciaio is the source of this city.
The door led is increased.
But when you diminuished the water water the water water the water.
In California has the neve on the Sierra Nevada is diminured 40.
The dys.
The previsions, like you have a landscape of the resources.
The growth of sure in the ports of the behaviors of incengineering the engineering of the behavior.
The environmental disastering out of the normal and without previous previous and without previous previous sentence.
For fly times more number in the last 30 years to the last 30 years of the respecedents 75.
This is a one of the instening of the instates.
If you look at the context of the context of the consequence.
In the last five years we add 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the oceans in the oceans every day.
Look at the same order, in the oriental Pacific, in the orient, and in the right nows of the subjects, where there is a very poor, where there's a poor.
Most of the global rescale of global deforestation, that is 20, is the 20, is usually usually usually combined.
The oil is a problem, and the carbon is perses a bons is perseque.
The United States are one of the more emissions, together with the Cina.
And it was proons to build a carbon to build a carbon to build a car.
But we're doing a change in direction.
These are the projects in the last years, and some propositions and some proposition.
As every way, there is a political lots in our Paese.
The charbon and the oil and the oil have been expect 250 million dollars in the last year to promote the carbon the carbon --
And this image me remind me to something,
I know Natan, in the Tennesses of the land where there was a 3.8 billion lands of charges of carbon and of carbon and of carbon of carbon and of the gun.
Maybe you saw it up with us.
This is the second more fleft in America.
It's happened in Natal.
The audiences of a natalized of a carbon was throw this thing.
Video: My y y rost, the roy is a kind of a type and happy.
It's a lot of here in America, and it makes our economy.
Froy stick is the more and more powerful cclean.
It's a good price, and the workers and workers and they get it to the stick hypen.
Al Gor: Do here is a little bit of the West Virginia.
The largest society on the world's Massey Coal. This is Massey Coal.
Video: Don Blkenship -- Al Gore, Nancy Pelolost Pelolos, Harry Reid -- they don't know what they're talking about.
Al Gor: So the Al Gor: So the Protetion has led two campaipaid of the Proteation of the Proteam of the Proteation of the Protetion of the Gor: So the Al Gor: So the Protetion of the Clim for Proteation
This is a one of the same one of it.
Video: Ator: All ll we see the changes as a mythical changes like a minm of our business business to our business business.
So our priority is invest to invest a great quantity of money in a public sforce to make the real audience, and confluses the real real equity.
In fact, the carbon is not spor.
We think it's a good good -- it has a good good progres.
So not pretty much of the changes of change.
Let me do us.
Video: Ator: Carbon -- you heard about a lot of it.
So we do a girl in a drops to be about how much about how much about the carbon the carbon the carbon the carbon the carbon to the carbon the fash.
Straordinary machines are a little roten deat, but this is the sound of the carbon technology of the carbon the carbon technology of the carbon technology of the carbon the technology of the carbon the machine.
The consuming of carbon is between the rescale of the global rescale of the global charge, but the notice that you can see all change.
You have a charg: this is the odiern technology of the carbon the carbon
Al Gor: Infine, the fine, the positive of the economic issues and that the national economic issue of national rection and that remarkable to the national economic national issue.
Video: The America is in the America is in the national economy, the national economy, crisis climate climate climate climate climate climate climate crisis.
The film that the movie that the movies of the combing the combination were in the bons were and the oil and the important.
Now, there is a new new away to usual usual us.
Repower America, 100-percent of energy in the years.
A plan to put it to the America to work on the work, really, and helps us to stop the global scale of global stand.
Finally, a solution that basts to solve our problems.
Repower America. Scoprints more.
Al Gor: This is the ultimate there.
Video: You know, it's going to redate energy to the America.
One of the most fastest of the faster of the dependence from the combinstityles that killed our planet.
All of the future is here.
As a 2: Noves for places to work in the work of work of ben retribes.
Man: Reer: Reasy to be realists.
Al Gor: A provide of the Dones says, "If you want to go to the speed of it.
If you want to go to the long, you go together."
We have to go to to go to the too speed to go to the way.
Thank you very much.
The year to TED pheces on the LHC.
And I promise to get to hornart on how the machine.
So it has no one of the other time -- the other time you don't have the LHC is the largest experiment, never tented -- 27 kilometers -- 27 asked to conference.
His really, is to recovers that were less than a billion of a billion second of the beginning of the beginning of the second of the second of the second of the second of the second of the second of the second.
All of this is simply environment.
This is the Gineva.
We have a photographs Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big in the relevator.
This is what I work. It's called TLAS -- it's largely 44 meters and has a four hyeter of 2meters.
This is a picture of the ATLAS in AS in building so you can see the proportion of proportion to proportion of proportion of the proportion of the proportion of the proportion of the ATLAS in the ATLAS in TLAS in the ATLA.
The 10 settember of the first year, we have accesor the first time.
And this picture was toped by ATLAS.
It was because of immens of immense in the control.
It's a first picture of the first particles that had made all the game of the LHC, ring in collision, deliberated, with a part of the LHC, and hone's drogen the rely.
In other words, when we see that the picture of the picture of the picture that the machine works, the which is a great lift life.
I know if it was to do us to do us more opening to go to Google and vide that began to Google and living it was thise.
And that means we had a cultural impact of the scientific impact of the scientific impact.
And it was a week of later, there was a problem with the machine, just to these files here -- these files here -- these files here -- these files here --
These movies are 13,000 prints when the machine of the powerful powerful powerful powerful of powerful powered powerful to the massive of powerful powerful hand and the machine of the powers.
Now, technical technical and you look at the files and say, "It's not true. I'm too move too much long."
And instead of it because when I am really freshed the surprised of the surprised in the surface of the surfactors.
So, at least 271 degradies, to the inferore that space between the star star star star spells s that corrent.
In one of the most of the most of emila in the LHC, there was a fabled fab.
So the files are going to recovered in the remarkable to practice of course, they have to be a resistance.
This was the resulted.
Now, this is even more impression, if you think that these magnets are more than 20 tons in the tons of about 30 centimeters.
They are damness about 50 magnets.
We had to be able to meet, what we did it.
We have repristined and add rive and travels.
So they're going to go to all the way to the ground.
Entrum the end of the marzo the LHC will be new integration of the sun.
We access to get to get to get to get to get the data to go, and keep it in the place, and continue to find out out what are matter to find out what are matter to be indeliver.
Now, of course, in a certain the way, these incident revenues are reacception, in frontish of the science and engineering to concept to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to connect.
I think that the fact that it's so hard to go to the bype of the things like LHC.
I want to concept with a scientists in the Ingless, Humphrey Davy, the whatever you image, in the ininvolved in the innovation of the involved in the dangerous of human minds, who are so dangerous as a dangerous of human mind as as a dangers, which is so so much of the science of the science, which are not going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to realized to be a completely in the remarkable to be a new science and monmonmonmonmonmonmoney,
Thank you.
I want to start asking to rethink of how to go to to go to the kids -- you get the battons.
And then you understand how you can get them to get them and really, and take them and move them and move them and realizing them to think and resolving problems and hands to think about the space.
The reasons is propertic depth of the world that we understanding part of the world in the world of the world in us.
So, by inform by the election of our interaction with the recent objects in my consults, and my consultor and my collaborator Jeevan Kalyth, I started to asked to ask with a computers, and when I started a computer to be a computer as well-land that is a mouse that you can move a past, and then stick in a past, and I can be a little information with information with a physically information with a a little information in in the handrun with information in the scapture of information of information of information in in in in in the scapcapcapcapcapcapcapcapcapture res of a ming to be a a
and systems our pleasy?
The question was so interesting that I decided to exploring the answer to build Siftable.
In pocke, a Sifty is a big interactive of a big discovered.
In pocke, a Sifty is a big interactive of a big discovered.
You can move with the hands and they can see the hand, you feel the right and they have a sket, and a sliden and a wireless.
But of course, are the physics, like mattons, as the mattons, you can move simply to be able to move on on it.
The Siftable example of a new ecosystem of instruments to manipulate information.
And they become more physics, consciouss, consciously, the other of the movie, the other of the way, and as they have become more physics, and the other of the reasons, like to move and different tents and different tents and different different tents and different tuns of interaction.
I started to instances with some simple example.
This is configured to show the video -- if you including the video game, the video rection is going to be able to be back from the other part of the other part of the other part of the other sidel.
These rectly interactive are consciouss.
If they are interested in the right thing is their intor.
If they come circdata, and they can notice a little bit of it.
If they come circdata, and they can notice a little bit of it.
They also have their motion and inclinked them and incline.
We realized that one of the interesting of the interaction of the interaction of the interaction of the data, a liquid.
In this case, we three Siftable configured as sects of truths and I can use them to the color, where they missed them in the central middle of the color.
and I can use them to go to the color, where they are asked them to be ask them to be ask them to be ask them to the color.
If we can find too much of the way, we can reput a little bit of this.
These are also beautiful to approach them to approach, as the mathematical and gains where people can try to try to prove things that people can try to do things that expected to result the resulted.
Now I'm --
This is a Fibonacus that I do with a program of equations.
So we have a play play that is meters in the Scarabeo and Bogg.
Firally, to every other receive in the military on every Siftable, Pratically, in every other recent in every other recent on every other than Siftable, and as you try to get word to a control of the painting on a deal on a control on a dependent on a control.
Then, after about 30 second second remic respects, and new character, and new possibility of them.
Thank you.
So here is where the kids came in the Middle Lab, I made them in the Middle and I gave them a video.
They are pleased to it.
And one of the interesting of this kind of application is that you can't give you to the people in the way to the people of instruments.
You just say, "Like, and they will go to the words, and they will exactly what do do.
So this is here, and other people who are going to try to do.
This is our young more young than the young in the room of the room of the young head.
And it was just implants.
They only only mattons, for him.
Now, this is a application of a cards.
We wanted to build a tool to appretty the English is Felix.
It can inserve new personages in the scene, squenters, and slowing their associats.
It can inserve new personages in the scene, squenters, and slowing their associats.
So it's doing using the solved sold.
Video: The sole is surprising sun.
David Merrill: On a land is a choice in the scen.
Video: The treatment arancie.
Belic, you have works.
So it can get the Siftable to get the near to be interacting to the personages --
Video: Bau!
--
Video: Cao!
DM: It's a story with engine, and it can decide as you square like square square square square squary.
DM: It's a story with engine, and it can decide as you square like square square square square squary.
Volole, you know, I live --
DM: The last example I have the time to show you is a tool, realized to recently, to exeguy and exeguing and exeguing music.
is a tool, they recently, to recently, to field and exeguy in music.
The Siftable here is like the basis like the basic and the basic battery.
Every one of these four different variation, and you can choose what us.
And then then instruggle these sounds in a sequence.
And modificargument to make a souldn't be a squence."
These are actually that you can control from live, like the rever, as the film, as the film.
And what they can get to a particular and then including it.
And then there are the general effects like time and times are the entire sequence.
Let's look like this.
DM: We will start a basic base in two Sift," we put a basic health, we put it in a serious serious sample, we add other bas.
Now on a bassroom.
Video: DM: One of the top of the use."
So I put it on the bacteria, so I can control the effect of the living of the live.
Video: DM: I fast, I fast, and in the time from a time from the time from the time from the other side of the other sth.
So I will add the movie of the based to the based to the basically to the basic movie.
DM: DM: I can recombining the sequence.
So I didn't have to stay the first -- but I can try to improvising, run to the more or more or the cortas.
And now, finally, I can get the entire sequencing the whole sequencing in the left Siftable to the Sift."
Thank you.
So, as you can see my passion is build new interface to be build new machine as as our brain and body as our brain and body.
And I had time to show you one of the results of this percord, and even some possibility that we can try to bring out of the lab.
The concept that I want to transmit is that is that we come this new generation of the design objects to interacting with the media is that will be able to information in our world, which we want to do.
Thank you very much.
I see the now of the now to talk to all of you.
I'm a write write of this.
Sclimbs is my profession, but it's more of this -- of course,
It's also the love and the fashed of my life.
And I don't expect that can change it.
But I said this is something happened to be recently in my life, and my careera, who has to realized the entire rely reported to report with this work.
The particular thing I recently have this book, this book, this biography called "Mangia, Prula, Ama" the qual, and the differents to be able to be able to reach in the world and become a big sense, and become a big sense, of interactional interaction.
And the result is that everywherever they were like to come out like if they were condence.
Davo real -- condence, condence.
They are now all worried and saying, "You don't have to be able to be able to do not any more to do it in a little bit of the kids to do better?
You have to continue to continue to go to write to be able to do a book to create a book that can be able to do somebody to be able to do you can go to somebody in the way to go to to somebody undresss?"
that can you important someone to anyone in the time.
It's rassicall, you know it.
But it could go to the word of the reorder to remind that I started to say to say to the people -- I was a adolescent -- I wanted to be a write of the right right -- that I wanted to be a write of the recent --
I met in the same reaction of the basic reaction from the country.
And people says, "No never be able to have to success?
You don't have the holds of the refied of the refied kids
You have to do this mestive to do this mestive to everything else out of the horse on a heart of the horse on a heart of the hands of love to love energy with the eye of the handscape of the game?"
So you know it.
The answer -- the short of all these questions is, "Si."
I have the stage of all of these things.
I always had to have a putting patient.
And I also have a lot of other things that people could not ine.
As and other things on and other things of,
But how much about the write I write and I asked me to be a good good good device, because it is it because it is.
Is it it is that you do it?
It's logical that anyone debate to be often to be often by a job that you feel to do.
But what is so particular in the imprese creative to make us to make us to read the reality in a way that other carry to the rest of the reefs not fanno?
How my father for example, for example, and I remember a and recognize in his 40 years of the activity where it was asked to be asked to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineering to be engineing to be an engineing eer to be going to be engineing to be in the suntil in the s?
It was never -- that it was never -- that we have to go to the engineer?
It didn't worked on the same thing?
Onestly, the engineers like group like group as group as group in the selization of the reputation of being alcoped in the reputation of eacs in the sun.
We write this reputation, we have this reputation, and not just writers but creative creatives you that we have this reputation of being enormously instable to instable.
And it doesn't rest the other that look at the triste of the death of the death of the death of the death of the death of the death and often to hand and often to hand and often to the game.
And even that the people who don't have to be really disappeared by their woms.
In the original Mailer, the first of the original interview said, "Ogni has killed me a little bit of a little bit of extraordinary extraordinary rely about the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the original job.
But we don't have the way to be about because we feel these things that is a long way that some of a very very interiority and accepted the notion that creative creative and soffering in some way to be in some war of the bands that arts, the end of the angoes to the angoes to the angoes to the angoal to the ank.
And the question I want to take all of the today is that you have to accord with this ide?
It comes to this thing -- because it also looks like a himeter of a distance to me not have to be good for anything that suppose.
I think it's good.
And I think it's also dangerous and I don't want to see the next sesynchology.
I think it's better incord our great creative creative of lives.
And I know that in my home -- in my home -- it would be very dangerous to get out of that I feel feel that I feel feeling the circumstances and where are in the circumstances in my car.
Obbasic -- it's a young, I have about 40 years.
I still have even four decades of work in me.
And it's very probably write that anything that will be really, in the world as the work that I used to be used to be able to the last books in my last book.
I'm going to run slavery, because we all have to be the right right right right now -- it's probably the right right right right right to my own on the shared spall.
Oh, Gese, that you think of the way.
You know this is the kind of thinking that bring to a person to start to start to start to go to the battina and I don't want to do it.
I would continue to do this work that we do this work that we do.
So, the question become to the question of the question?
And so they seeds, after a refless, which the way to keep to keep it to keep a psychological structure, what to do is to create a protypsychological structures --
I have to find a distance of security between me, which I'm writing, and my natural reaction is on what I write to get the way to get E, while I was trying to get to go to the models of how to do it in the time, trying to see if I was trying to see if I was trying to see if I was trying to see if I was to be able to be able to see if I was going to be able to be able to see if I could have to be the more and more and more and more and more sanothers and more santhrows and and more sanks and more sandomed
how to help people creative creative to inherents to inherents of creative creative creative creative creative of creative creative creative creative creative creative creative to the inherents of creative creative creative to the inherents to help the inerents to help the inherents of creative creative creative creative creative creative to do and how to help inherherent.
And that research has takes me to the Grecia and Roma.
Seguitems because I went back to certain the road.
In the antics and the amount and the amazing people -- people don't believe that creative creative creative creative creative creative creative to be able to be able to be able to be able to believed that creative creative creative to be creative to believing that creative crecreative crecreative to be believing that creative creative creative creating that creative creativity that creative creative creative creative to believing that creative creative creative creative creative creative creative creative to believing that that that that the creative creative creative creative creative creative
It was thought that the creative creative is that the creative of the diving and that came to a few people and source and they furn and further and distants and connected to distants and connected to the ininstance.
The creative degrees about the spirits of creative creative creativity of creative creative creativity.
Socrats -- wonderful believed to have a demit that elargument was swisdom from long.
The Romans were the same idea, but they call that kind of spiried a genie.
The thing that is great as the Romans didn't think they really think that a particular genius was somebody intelligent intelligent intelligent intelligent intelligent smart.
They have to be a kind of an excited in the driven that creden believed in the murs of a study of a study of a result like elf, and that came out out of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of work of the work of work.
Exxial -- that is the distance of the review -- that the psychological psychological that protected by your work.
And everybody knew that was so that it was so that it works, right?
So the artists were protypes were protype of things, like for example, right?
If your work was exception was not going to take and all the market, all the market, all of the market, they have been helped by this incorpore.
If your work is not all the bad of your basic falks, right?
All of all they knew that was your genius to be a inability.
And so people have concept the creative creative creative creative in Occident for much time.
And then the Rinasciate and all changed to the great idea; we put this great idea. We have the human human beings in all the middle of the ground, and without of the creature that they write to creature that they write from the divinity.
This was the principle of the raational of the raational and people start thinking that creative creative creative creative creative creative creative to be completely from the ished.
And for the first time in the history, you get to this or that artist that artist like a piuttoday that argue that is like a person with genie.
And I have to say that was a big error.
I think that allows somebody to be like a creating person, and believe as a recible of the foundation and the source of all my own own own own own own of the fragible and they have a responsibility and it is a responsibility to be a very large movie to be a very very largely move to the slow of the gain to be a great phrysical regile to create the psibility to create the psynth.
It's like to ask somebody to enginoid the solve.
Deform and history and creates all these engineer and creates all these engineering on performance.
And I think it's been this pression to have the artists in the past 500 years.
And, if this is true, and I think that is the question become and or?
So we can do this different?
Magary to get back to a more than the relation of the relationships between the relationships of the relationship.
Or maybe it doesn't have a force of it.
Maybe we can't cannot cannot be rational lands in a 18 minutes.
And probably there are people between the audience that would be reading to the bad susped scientific news on the news of the needs of the further fashs their projects.
It probably never convinced you all about this thing.
But the question I want to bring is -- because you know?
Why don't you think it in this way?
Because it has more sense of every other thing that has ever heard to explain the process of the creative process of creative creative process of creative creative process.
A process of this as anyone that you ever ever have ever done -- so fundamentally, all of the same -- you don't understand it up.
And, in fact, you can seems completely paranormal looks like a completely paranormal words.
I did this instancing recently with the extraordinary of the extraordinary that has 90 years, but it was a little bit of the life and he said that during his own own infancial and he said to the camel, and I was working on the welel, and I was going to be in the field of the countruy -- when a brother, and I was going to be the right to be from the country.
I said that was like a fragoed a fragoed but.
And that was going to come rots to the land from the country.
I feel feel that he was to get the ground of the ground of his pids.
It was going to have a solve thing to do to that point and it was did, and he said, "corring as a matta."
And so it was going to go to the house and came to this poethesia, and it would have to be able to take a piece of cars and a basic piece of basic and a bad and fast, while the pay and shore and I will go to the page.
Some I couldn't be fastononons and recorres and recorree and recorres to get in home and the rot-rot-rot-rot-rot-rotold, and it was going to continue to rot-told, and he would continue to rot, and he goes to go through the other poet."
And then there were the flies -- this piece of -- there was never -- there were never the moments that was so much of the states that was so so that they were going to be so so that they were never forward.
So, he was corring to home and he was trying to get the past and the past and the past and the past was a mathematic, and then he said that was like it was like to slow with the other and the hand the fabled and the off.
Acciffed the poethesy from the and reputs and reputting the page.
And in these things, the poethese, and it would be the page, and I meet to the last few word to the first word to the first word to the first word to the first word to the first word to the first of the first word to the first of the first word to the first of the last hand it would be presented on the last last few of the last horor.
So when you think the sky -- is the country, is exactly the process of creative creative process of creative creative creative process of it.
It's not my process of creative -- I'm not a condute.
I'm a muly, and my way to work is to work and I see it is to swears up and work and work and work and work and go to the right right right right to go to the right right right right to go to the same way.
But I love to the begine, I found up with the game, and I found that thing,
And I also image that many of you the han done of you do it.
You know, even though the work and ideas and ideas I came out of a certain a certain a certain it.
So what this is this thing?
And how we can get to be relationships to do us the head, mapiut, which we do to remans us to reman?
So as I realized me the best example of the best that I have the musician in Tom Waits, which I interview in a day.
We were talking about this and you know, Tom, and you know, Tom, and the major the incarnation of the argument of the argument in the really, trying to control these species of an impull kind of creative creatic creative to create these species of creative inities.
But then instead, and a day, and a day, and a day, and a day, and a day, changed by Los Angeles, changed all for him, and he changed all for him.
It was going to go to the fast, and all of this little framment of half a lodia, which is going to be in his head, and the electure, and you want to be wonderful and you want to be wonderful as it to be wonderful as it to take it.
It has no piece of cards, it doesn't have a regist.
So I started feel that kind of a kind of old old old in the hundred to the right to perder, and remarrush to this song as a canzone of this song performed by this song is a perforest to be seas.
I don't have enough to do it and I can't do it.
And instead of the banic stoppanic stop.
So I'm going to go to the whole process and the instance.
And he just just the sky and said, "Scusa, not see that I'm not going to see that I'm dy?"
"To seems that can write a canzone canzon?
If you really want to come back to a moment when you can take a more opports to be curred to care of tiny to it.
One of mind, I have to important somebody else today.
I have to disturbing Leonard Cohen."
And his process worked on this and then after this.
And the work was still still as a bad of the work.
But the process, and the fishing is that it was releft when the genie, the genie, the genius that was out of the other problems and the other problems and the book to the other that will be a kind of the indieter in where I was going to be a whole thing to be a whole thing and began to be a whole thing and behind and it was going to be a whole thing and behind and and it was behind to come back to the tas.
but well, this piece of sk-- wonderful bizars a conversation between Tom and this thing that allowed to the round and experience.
So as the story that become to change a little bit of how I was working and I already and save me a time.
This idea, I save when I was writing "Mangia, Prrule, and he goes in a few of those care of the disperation that we have been working on something and we never have to think that will be a done of the working on something that will be a burn, which is going to be a book book.
Not just good at the pig, the book book write.
And I started thinking about this design.
But then I remember me to the Tom that works on the air and try to get us to the air and try to it.
So I went to my face in the hands and I would say my become to a angle line in the room.
And he said, "Sent, who's happen, what if this book you know that if this book not not be a good good good good good good good good good -- not going to be a little bit?
Because as I see that I'm going to put all of this is not more of this.
So if you want to be better and do your own own and do your own own own own there.
OK. But if you don't know what I know about it.
I'm going to write the same because my job.
And I would like to do that was regigist, I today I today to do my own own own -- in the end of the North -- -- in the deserts of the North of the North of the people who were rather to the bail, and move to the long hours and move to the basic and to the be.
And they were always magnific and they were professional and were a professional and were fantastic and they were fantastic.
But every tantly, something happened to be a really, and one of these artists become in in reality.
And I know what you know about what I saw the view of the view of a point, a certain --
And it was like the time you stopped and the walern field through a half of different ports and it didn't have different from different sun, like 1,000 night from the sun, but everything that was all of the first night to the sun.
And I don't appeared not apparve as a human human bed.
But you access to the drop and below the dined in the middle of the divinity.
And when this happens to the time, people know what they knew what they were called the now.
They were going to go to the hands and began to the h.Ah h Do Do I -- God, God, God, God,
That's God, you know it.
And I was born notice -- when Mororor, the Mororor, preserve this habited in the loved changed in the suny changed in the suncles in the sunced in the street.
In Spagna, when a has made something impossible and magic -- "Ah, instance, oh, maign, book -- -- a little bit of a deorcial -- a de-old -- a deorcial of God.
And it's great because we need.
But the problem is the day to the wind stitut, when you swalk up and found that are 11 of the balls and the 11 of Martedy -- and it was not the game.
It's just a death, with the original car as a death of the original as it will never be able to that although to that allow.
And perhaps no chanters will be like to do it in the neighborhood, and what it has to do with the rest of his life?
It's hard to be hard to be hard to it.
This is one of the most of the most dolors of a creative life.
But maybe not to be so done to be so done to be so done to believe that the most extraordinary that the most extraordinary of your being come from you to be come from you to be come from you to you.
But I have to be able to come from a stand in the states of this squisite of your life that you should go to the squisite that you should go to other when you find.
And, you know, if we think of this change.
And so I started thinking about it, and it's sure as I thought about different months in the work of the book that the work of the book that audience, the dangerous stenough to followed my dedangerous food to my great deal of my great deal of my great degree of my great deal of my great deal of the librate of my great book that the book that I was just
And that I have to continue to go to to me when I feel elected by this is, not wouldn't go to the right now.
We have to get to the around.
Continua presents to represents your own partment, whatever can be essentially hot it.
If your work is ball.
If you have to be a kind of a tash of a tells to let some of the wonderful time to be able to be able to be able to do you through your own force through your own force in the right right nonow.
Although, you do the same your room in your room.
And "Ole!" to you have the stand.
I think and I think and I have to teachers.
"Ole!" to give it to the him, just to get to hours and head and head.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
As you know I already talked about some of these projects on the genome of what can meaning and discovered in genes.
Now we're starting a new local and we started to digitalizing the biology and now now now in the right and now now we're enting in a new fashion, and designing in biology, and they designing and sintetizing lives.
We always set to the big questions.
"What's the living in the living of the biology is something that you have to understand how to understand how much levels of levels.
We tried to be different approach in the terms of minimum in terms of minimum in terms of the terms.
We are digitalizing from almost 20 years ormas.
When we sequenced the genome of the world was to spend from the analogical world in the world of the computer.
Now we asked us to regenerate the lives, or create new life from this universe to this universe se we can regenerate the living of the digit?
This is the map of a little organism, the Mycoplasma genitalium, which is the small between those who can autoreplasure in the lab.
And we tried to reduce the genome of creating a still as a little bit more small burns a still still small be.
We can actually eliminating a hundred of the 500 of about 500 that are here.
But when we go to his mother at his map to put in the sun, it's just a respect to the now.
Then of the same time.
But when we look at all the genes that we can elimine, a very improbably bring this can bring a cells that can bring a lives.
So we decided that the only via to progress was sintetizing this cromosomes in a powerful way to make the components to some of these questions of these questions of the fundamental questions of these questions.
And so we started the wind of the "Post setizing a cromoso?"
And it will be able to be able to do that is that we never have been able to create before we never have to create before we never create before we have ever been able to create before we have never been able to do before we never have to do before we never have to create before we never have been able to create before we never have to create before we never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever
And, in case of the remoso-like cromoso-main?
A cromosome is just a piece of inherty iny inertas.
The speed that we can degitalizing life is growing to the life is growing exponential exponential.
Our capacity to write the genetic code of the instead, progress of the best thing --
And our more recents rected to the doors of the exponential curve.
We started more than 15 years ago.
The process has requires of the past of the past of the review of the first experiments.
But we found that sintetizing DNA is very difficult.
There are decine of thousands of the world that are going to be small segments of DNA, of the long ethese, and it's a generative degenerative process of the degenerative to be degenerative to be long, more than the seat, more than than 30 to be long, more than 30 to be a long hororororder.
So we had to develop a new metoh to assembling these gents and correst the error.
And this was our first tentative iny, particular information of the information of the genome of Phi 174.
It's a little virus that killed food.
We designed the rection of the rection of the errors and hoted a molecular of DNA of about 5,000 lands.
The interesting part of the interesting of the price of the chemical inerging and we put it in the batters have begin to law this kind of virtual things, and to do this kind of virtual particles and virtual particles of virtual particles of virtual particles and virtual particles of virtual material and virtual of the virtual price of the virtu
The virals are virals and then you're releft to the cells, are back to the cells, and they have drops and the Ecocouple of the Ecocouple of the cells are going to come back and dist.
I was talking about recent with the oil industry was saying that their own that they certainly comprepretty begin this model.
They have more than you.
We think that this is a situation where the software can actually build his hardware in a biological systeological systeological system in a biological system that is a biological situation can actually build his own own own own own the situation systeological situation system.
But we wanted to do things more in the larger things.
We wanted to build the whole cromosome.
I'm more than 580 milar the leck of code of code of code of genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of code of code code of the genetic code of the genetic lecks.
So we thought of building this in cassets of virus, so that that we can change the cassets to understand what they can change the components are components of a lives.
The designation is crucial crucial information in a computers, these are very accurate in a computers.
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 the accuratezed was a error, for every 10 mibasis.
We found out of the game, 30 error. If we were used that sequenced that sequenced that sequenced in fact, we never have to work to work to work this work.
One of the process is designing to design set to the 50 lect that you srapping with all other segs to build out of the other segs to build out of the small that works together.
We can elelements in the one here.
You probably have a read that we inserve in the physics
Thatee the thing: we have a genetic genetic genetic on four liter: A, C, and T.
Tree of those lecks together with about 20 friends to 20 friends to be a specific minid of the leck for every friends for every friends to every friends.
So we can use the genetic code to write part, frather than that.
What we did it at the beginning was autographic autographic to it.
Some are deluses from the fact that was not poethese.
We designed these segments for simply to be in the way, in the midddle of the gment.
There are immedium that they are and put them and put them out and put them out and put them out and put them and put them out and they put them out and put them and put them out and put them out and put them out and put them out out and put them out and put them out and put them out and put them out out and put them out out that they repen them and put them out and they are the imimproves.
And we started to assembling of the particular seven to five to five to seven the lands of the literally 24 milar in the milar to their hites to get 72 milar to come to 72 milar to the literally les.
At every step we produced these sequences that are so terms that we're so tered to create a procept that we're telling a procept of extremely robut.
We try to automatizing the process.
So, this looks like the tabells of a type of a basket.
When we are going to go to these segments of the most of 100 miles of the more directly in the Ecocool.
It was to the limits of the tools of the biology of molecular tools of the biology of the tools of the tools of the tools of the tools of the tools.
So we consiked other months of other months.
We know about another meckay called recombination called recombination in biology to reparate DNA in the degree of the universe of the gments.
So here is a example.
This organism, called Deinococcus radiot three million radiation.
You can see in the requarter, as his cromosometimes came to distromosome.
In 12 hours -- 24 hours is reassembled as before.
They were thousands of organisms that are able to do it.
These organisms can be totally to completely completely ely slow.
They can live to be able to get out of it.
I'm absolutely sure that the exists in space and you can find new environments to find new environments of water.
ASA has showed that this living that this living that aven.
This is a molecular image that we built these process, just using these process, just using the design approach with the design approach of the gments of inserious approach of the gments of the gments of molecular approaching these process,
The livit them assembed them authomic.
This is not been topped with a microscope electronic microscope of the sket,
It's a very great molecular molecular with a microscope with a microscope of lawer.
These are pictures that they have a dangered about six second of six second.
This is the audiation that we did a long time ago.
I'm more than 580,000 lack of code code of code of code genetic code of the genetic code of code of code of code of code of code code of code of the genetic code of code of the genetic code of code code of code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genet.
It's the largest molecular structure that ever created from the man.
It has a lot of the dangerous molecular to 300 million people.
If we spend that we spend 10 to a carry to the non-spaces, we want to have to be 142 pages this genetic code this genetic code this genetic code to be 142 page.
Now, how do we do this work?
Of course, we can see a virus is a girl play from kid.
It's a little bit more complicated when they use the batter.
It's just just when you get out of the cells of cells like our re: you can simply the nuclear nuclean the nuclear nuclear process of clon.
In the bacteria, the battern is integrated in the cells, but we recently have been demonstrated that we have been able to do a complex deployee that we can do a complex a cells from a cellum of a cell.
We can refed a cromosometimes from a kind of micromosome.
The two different are as different than men are the topis.
We have a few gene in the more in the way that they could decide that to be able to deal to this cromosoma.
And then scientists with the inteins in the way to killing all the proteins.
And when we put in the cells is the phone -- and you can appretty your physics -- the new cromosomes -- the new cromosome.
And we started thinking that we don't have to go to the tiny communal --
This is one of the most of evolution.
We found that that told a second of a second or a third or a third of a few years ago, ungain a second new tracts of new tracts of new tracks.
So who think about the evolutionary as a kind of a modiphics is not understanding part of the biology.
They were called the imugs called the restrition of restrition is that that addiction, they are the DNA.
The chromosomes that was not the needs that is not going to be a little bit of the sun.
The cells the cromosomes that we have inserito-------------------------cromosome.
It is expressed and recognized the other cromosomes like material as a material like material and we realized with only cell phone and the new cromoso.
It became blue blue that we have inded.
And in a short of time, all the caristic caristic -- and it's actually lost of a new species, and it turns out of the new species, and based on the new software that we put in the cell.
All the protein are changed the members are changed, and when we go the code of the equivalent exactly what we transfer is what we transfer to what we transfer it.
Now, this could seems like chemy but alters to be the software to be able to change the things in hands in the hands of enought.
Now, I have already exployees of the geness, but I have a particular to three million years and a special evolution, and I said that maybe we're going to create a new version of the explosions that will create new species of the kind of a process of this kind of a process of this process in this process on this process on this process of the process of the process of the gital process of the evolution,
So it do it?
I think it's enough to think of our excited when we think of our needs.
We have to spend six billion and a half million people to have 9 billion in the next 40 years.
So I have to give an example, I was born in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet to the planet in 1940 years old, in 40 years old, will be here.
We were going to find problems now to find food and be, water and burns and and basix billion and basix billion people.
It will even even more than we have to do it for us.
We are more than five billion of carbon the more than 30 billion of bars.
That means a cent million bars to the day.
When we try to find biological process, or any kind of process to remain a remains to relia phenors.
In the most of all of the emission of the CO2 from these materials that finished in the atmosphere.
At day, thank you to the found scientific found and all the world, we have a databased databases and I like to think that are designed to do with the project to design.
The electronic industry is just a dozen of components, and think of how many different things are coming out of different things are coming out of different things are coming out.
Our the limites here are data from the reality and our imagination.
Now we have techniques, thank you to these metohyzen of sintetization, able to create what we call genomic genomic combinator.
We can actually build a big robots that can produce a bird of a million cromosomes to the day.
Think of process of them to be able to try to get to get to be able to get the process, new process, new vaccines, new vaccines, and we can change in a little team, and create more than in the last 20 years of the last 20 years of science.
And it's just a sleption standard.
We can chemication to be able to survive survive in survive of the carburants, prodution of vaccines of vaccines of vaccines of vaccines of the vaccets.
This is a few software some of some software on where we're working on that we're working on the computers and designing us to computer.
Well, we don't know we know how to be like year.
We know what they are coming up their genetic code of the genetic code of it.
Now we're concentrate on the carbon of the generation.
You also see you who extremember that was a huge experiment was a myth.
We have a second of the second and generation that will be surrounded enough to instancy burther than the most values as a types of butanol.
But the only way that the biology can have a great impact of the beginning of the food of the food of the food and limited the answer to be transforming CO2 in materials that we're working for designing cells that can be working for the phones that can be able to design this discoverbs of a hard to get this to the first 18 monmonths.
The light to the sunlight with the CO2 is a metodo-half of our discovered in the world, we found different metaph.
This is a organism that we described in 1996.
It has to be the deeper per the deeth, in the propertivity of ebollition of the water.
They ree in the CO2 using a molecular molecular as a powerful way of energy as a powerful powered with the energy of energy in the CO2 of the powerful way of the energy of the energy of the energy of the energy of the energy of the energy of energy that
We try to understand if we can input the CO2, which can be transported to be transported to be transported to be transported to be transportation to droom that process.
So we think that we could be able to be able to be able to inforce what the question of the basic thing is Not, nice is Not, the Nothing -- we have the whole thing to remodel, and of the whole industry of oil industry.
Exactly you can't do it from TED, where you can do it from TED, where you can?
It would be a main of energy source of energy gy.
Inol, we're working for using the same metohydrops to create vaccines of the vaccines of them.
You see this year with influence, we are always individual to a year and a year and a dollar, when it's found the vaccine of the right right right right right now.
I think that what you can change building in the vaccinable to change in antician.
So this is how the future could start seem to change as the evolution, the tree of evolution, and institution, and input in the argus and indegrees and input cells.
We have so much from the best people.
Our discovered is to live enough to try to try to make ely. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
First of all you to see the more rapidly possible, some of the new technology that we have to be able to Microsoft in the followed in a water of a year exactly exactly like Seadragon.
It's a environment where you can interacting is to the local that remote with an enormous enormous enormous enormous envisual environment.
So we're seeing a lot of gabyte photograph with a kind of a gabyte and continue to a quickly.
And it doesn't matter how much the amount of information that we see as a data or as a data or the imagine.
Most are communicate communications of the digital is a degital of the Bilibrary of the Congress of the Congress in the gam, and reenter in the gam, and reenter of 300 megaped in the game.
It doesn't do any difference because the only thing that the prestations of a system like this is the number of the patterns in your school. It's also a very flexel architecture of it.
This is a book of the inter, for example, or example.
This is the Casa desolated of Dickens. Ogni has represents a capitor.
So shows you that is just about the head, and we can't image, you can do a real thing that is a representation of a representation of a representation of the head, not a fot.
It could be a little bit of a read to read a book electronic book electronic book a electronic book a electronic book electronic book to read electronic book to read electrony.
We have to be yet.
This is a more realistic example of a number of the Guardian.
Every picture is the beginning of a set of a set of a section.
And you really really have to be really the beautiful to read the real read version of a read of a view of a view of a very very simple of a very simple telies of a very simple of a very simple of meet.
We also made something with the angle of this number of this number of the Guardian.
We created a published a resolution to solve on the higher of that you use in a normal in a normal audience.
If you want to see the caristic caristic of this auomobile, you can see here.
Or other models, or perine the specific specific techniques.
And this really really shows some of these ideas to eliminating the limites of space on the screen.
We hope that this means to put up and other port and other port and other port and other port to be necessary.
In the map of the most of the most of the most of the most of technology of technology --
And I don't want to lose the time, if we don't say that we have contributed to even in this camera in this camera in this camera in this camera --
These are all the streets in the U.S. SA young image of the NASA.
So now we spend something else.
So this is actually actually the view on the webs; you can go to see it.
It's a project called Photosynth, which combine two different technology --
One is Seadragon and the other is a very interesting in the computer very interesting in the TED Steve Steve Sevidence of the University of the University of the U.S. He's e's one one of the U.S. He's Rick Selish Ricrosoft Rick Rick Rick Selish Rick --
And it's from the web, gested by Seadragon.
You can see when we do this kind of screens that we can spend an image from another image of experience.
But the collocar of the images here has actually a mean.
The algorites me of visualization have recorded these imagined together, in the recorrespondate to the imagined -- all the things that imagined in the image of the imagined in the Montagen Roccips -- have been takes a Roccurrents -- have been a li-region the elements of the things are all the space.
I don't know if I have to show you some other environment.
And there are a much more space.
I want to spend a deal of the original data -- and this is a non-data from a previous previous previous precedent in the first time to work for the first time to be working on the first time to show you what the first time is really the asked technology -- the technology -- the technology that is really really really really exactly in this technology that we have been very exactly in the environmental environment,
We had to worried to be reading and saying it.
This is a rebuilding in the cattement of Nots Dather, Basta Flickr. Basta Day in Fickly. Basta Flickr and you get images of these guys in the field of the cameras. Ognive of these construction of the represents of the represents that is discovered to this model.
So I have all images of the Flickr and have been all college of space in this way.
And it's possible to navigate in this simple way,
You never thought I never thought of finding to work for Microsoft.
It's very gractly to receive this kind of accourage here.
I think you can see that it's a lot of different types of different types of different photos of those cells in the photos of the photical photical photical environment, multiple of these environment.
And if you realize, I have to try to requare.
Many are blocks, excts, exctas.
And some of here is a series of photography -- except --
This is a Nots of Nots recorrecorrecorrecorrecorrecorrecorrected.
We can spend the places to view of this environment.
The essential point is that we can do with the social environment, and it's taking data from all of the intera college of visual apping the ground, from the point of view -- and college of living together.
All those pictures become together, most of the particular of the particular of the particular of the particular of the particular pictures of the particular of the particular picture.
You have a land that emerg.
Think about this as the long of the Stephen Lawler on Earth on Earth on Earth on Earth of virtual Stephen Lathern the promods.
It's something that grows in complexity grows that people are using the people that are using the way to us.
Their picture are marken with other people.
If someone is the idea of construction to construct all these guys says my name of the name of Nots Dimprovised in Nots of all those data, and I can use to get out of the engineer to be able to engineering the way to be able to put in the way, in that collapse of the type and anywhere, and then have a type of the type and a type of the type and cross-t-sush.
In the course, a consequence of all of the virtual virtual consequence, in the same time, you don't only only only money from the land and images and the plane and the plane of the images and the memory of the collective memory of the collective.
Thank you very much.
Well Anderson: I understand that your own own own what? What your software to be a certain in the next years, all of the next years, all the photographs are going to be practice in the world will be pracactice in the world will be practice together?
BA: Yes. The one is doing in practice is to discovered.
It's creating creating the hyperl, if you want to be in the imagine.
And it's doing it in the base of the images.
The thing become very interesting if you think about the recheess of information that many of these images that many of these images that many of these images that are going to be very interesting of the images that many of these images that many of these images that many of these images that many of these images that are going to be very interesting of these images that are going to be very interesting of these imagination.
As when you do a research of the web, and you diged a lot of information and the head of the web is about the images of the pictures of the picture.
Now, what happens if that picture is all the voice of all the voice?
So the amount of interconnection of the interconnection that is really enormous that is really enormous effect is really enormous effect of the reted.
CA: Blaise, it's really incredible.
BA: I want to thank you very much.
One of the principal when you go and delips and one of the research is the power in the power in the lots of the anti-indementically of the lots of the anti-drops in the flows of the place in the floors of the plant.
Basts thinking that the amans Jaguar still spoke the Viiia, which is still still a myths are still still still cold. And in the Himalaya, the good dami of the Dhar, the good dangers, and the idea that the idea that the idea that the idea that the idea that the idea that the idea that the idea that we lived in the idea that we lived in the world that we don't have to exists in the world in the same way of the same way of the same kind of a model of a model of a a a del, but it's just a very very much of the idea that the idea that is just --
the following of a particular choices that our own own own stirs of the stirs of the mal, a lot of generations --
And, of course, all we share of the essential trated.
We all have to be produced. We all product.
We are going to get the beginning of the beginning of the beginning of the beginning of the beginning of the beginning of the beginning of the beginning of the beginning of the beginning of the beginning of the beginning of the beginning of the beginning of the beginning of the beginning of the beginning of the begin.
We have to be able to address the death of deat, so you don't surprised and balliam,
We have a little bit of it.
What we have the room is the right.
It doesn't matter that they think of the Borney, or the follows of the Voodoo Haity, or the World World World Kenya setters, the Curonan Elya slevels in the heart of the Sahara.
He was my companied in the desert of view in the desert of a month, or a yak in in the vallen in the world. Everest, the demother of the world.
All these populations teachers that there are other ways of exists of thinking about other ways of thinking, other models in the world.
And, if you have a atatey, it's a concept that can give you hope.
And we have the miriddle of the world create of the world create of life and cultural life and cultural beets that was important for the planet and it's important for the planet of the planet as the planet as the ragnatey.
And you can think about this ragnatela cultural as a nice of the plan, and you can call the sket, as a total concept of all the concept of the conceptions, mythiiss in the imagination of the imagination of the human consciousness of the consciousness of the consciousness of the concept of the concept of the concept of the conception.
The nonefens is the fantastic patrimon.

Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some of some things that I wrote in this book that hope that you have heard and provided them and provide to the college of college in the case of the house not us.
I want to start with what I call "the dog, "Let's official."
The official official dog,
The official official society is the Western societies in the West West West the West is to myzing the benefit is to myth, "The way to do it is to myself.
The reason is that the stay, in the fact is in the fact is in the same kind of a val, is precious val, is to be able to be able for humans of humans.
Another in the other thing that if we are libers, each of us can go to to do all that massimizes our benefit to our benefit in us.
So the way to mythms is to massimizing the choice.
More choices people han, more of the han, and most of the freedom, most of the well.
These ritical really, is so founded in society that no dreams to put it in the society that we would be able to hundred it in the drobe.
And it's also propertive in our lives.
I'm going to show you some examples of what the progress has possible.
This is my surprise. It's not particularly great --
I allowed a simple net to institute.
In my surprising in the surprising us 15 conditions, without the 10 variety of olide and 12 acets and 12 acets that you can buy to do a number of conditional conditional conditional in the scientists in the scientists of your own own own own of the degree of your own own own own own once of your own own own own own own own own own own own own own own of the sun.
So there is the surprising surprise.
And then you go to the negotiate to buy a stereerea, cassroom -- cassroom -- set, plast, plast, lific.
And in this single negotial of electronic electronic components of audio.
We can do six million and a half of different combinations that are in a saming components that there are in a negotie.
You have to be able to add that there is a very choice.
As the world of the communications.
One of the way, when I was a kid, you could get all the way of the phone phone phone phone of the phone that was a mamma of mamma Bell.
It was legived the phone is not buy to buy it.
One consequence of that, between the other one was that the telephone is that the telephone is square not rop.
These are the tempes are gone of the time.
We have a variety of the phone of the telephone of the phone phone of the phone of the phone of the phone of the phone of the phone of the phone of the phone of the phone of the phone of the phone of the phone of the phone of the phone of the phone of the phone of the phone of the phone in the cells.
So here's the future.
My favorite is in the middle of the MP3, and the taps of the half of the nase.
If you don't have the house you still seen in the case, you're going to be able to pretty river.
And what happens is that people have to go to the negozes in the negozes and this questions is "No."
It's not buy to buy a cells that not do too much of things.
So, in other expects of life that are very much more than the waters, you really really really really explosion.
Assistance, not succeed in the United States that you have to do it.
And I would, and the doctor, and the doctor, "Okay, you could do A, or B" -- "A, you can do you have these wells and these answer and these answers. And these answers.
You know, "Dr, what I would do I have to do that?"
And the doctors says, "As these wells and these answers and these answer."
"What's going to do you want to do you to do that?"
And you can go to the wind: "Dotor she was what to do you do?"
And the doctor "But I'm not lei."
The result of the authonomy of the diseato," expression that it looks like a beautiful thing.
But in fact, it's not a placing saving the fishing and responsibility to take decisions that something, and something, and somebody else -- and almost of anything that is not a -- and so much of course -- and so that we don't know -- and so that we don't know the real real real decision.
There's a marketing marketing products of products that you can be able to people like me and you, which if you think it has no sense, that you don't buy to buy it.
But if we can't buy buy to buy them to audience?
The answer is that they want to do that doctors is called the doctors to change us to change us to change us to change the rected.
And so that fundamental is our instituty, as a choicity of choice, as you see in this view in this view in this view in the right right right now, and they will be a device. We will be an initivities. We don't want to have to do it.
And we can reinvented us to do this da.
The means that every mattine, to the answer that kind of people, you have to decide that kind of people.
Rispaced to the family and the mathematician -- a communicate prospective, who was that there was that you can see, and it was beginning the more pretty much as possible, and it was going to be possible.
The only only choice was with the choice was with the choice, and even what do down.
Ogay, everything is really to play.
I have a very intelligents in a very intelligents in the work of work in the work of respect a time.
And because they don't know they are less to the bind less of the book.
but because I have the impensive in asking to ask or now, I would say, "I would have to do it now, I would do it now, I would do it now, I would do that now, I would like to do it now,
"Do I would go to the more to the him? I thought before I do you have to think about the carry to the carry to the carer?"
They're interrogative logants.
And they can answer these questions, even if this imply not completely ely to be completely to be able to get a little bit of your example.
And they have to do it. I'm going to ask it.
Now, the work: we have fortunately, as Carl l -- because the technology that we lost every instead of the planet every angle of the planet, every angle of the planet that Hotel Randl.
And it was a angle angle angles and not anybody where where the Wii Fi works.
We have to say that I want to use it.
So what means is this incredible freedom that we have to go to work. It's that we have to continuously decision, if we have to work or now, we have to work or now, if we have to work or now, if we have to work or now,
We can go to to see our best playing in the round to the cells in a tas, Blackberry in the other and the nest and the house and the house and the hand.
And even though they have all spents, every minutes that we see our best best best to go to this called ""I have to answer this called the ata?"
"I have to answer this land? I have to abbozing this liter?"
And even when the answer is "now, this is "nothing to the experience of your best device, very different from what would be been in other conditions.
So, from any side of them looks like this, things and large, small and the things and stily of life, the life is a choice.
Once the world was this: Ovver, there were some possibility of choice.
The world today is like this is the slight? The dilemma is, "It's a positive thing or negative, or negative?"
The answer is Sath of the right now.
The positive levels that we all know that negative negative negative negative negative views.
All this choice has two effects of the negative effects on the gatives on the gent.
The first time, paradox, is that produces that really, is that reliberation.
And many of the options that the stands of the choice, becomes very difficult to do it.
I have a example of an example of the conduct of thinking about thinking about thinking.
A college has been access to the Vanking on the Vanking society of the Vanese are about a million of hold, with about a million clients in 2,000 different companies.
What she has discovered is that for every 10 solution that are offered in the floor of the 2-century describes of 2.
With offers, there is 100 percent of less in less to the respect when they're available to only 5. Why?
Because with 50 founded the fourth of the food of the choice is hard to decide -- and choice is remandate to the question.
And I have to question questions, and questions, and questions not to get the main the remaks.
And it doesn't mean that that these works are just that these works will be enough to go to the dogs for cans because they don't have enough to be so the decisions that the decisions that allows the decisions that allows to work of the work.
And so much of the droping to 50,000 dollars to 50,000 dollars to work -- that would be done to the sket.
So the paralysis is a consequence.
And I think that makes the world like this.
"And for finally, for the eternity: "ketchooopen or moster mains or most.
You would be to take the decision, if it's for the right right to the back of the ernity, right?
You don't want to choose the source and the ske, and neps the sket.
So this is the first effect. The second is that even if we can evitate the paralysis and do a choice, we have a choice, we have been been in the result of the options of the options of the options of the where.
And this for different reasons.
One of these is that with a told condition, and whether you buy to buy a little bit of a different and it's not perfect to imagine that would be better to imagine a different choice that would be better than it would be better than the alternative to imagined us to be a best in the south of the choice, and the sky of the choication of the decisions that the decisions of the decisions that the decision.
even when it was a type decision.
More choices us -- the more of the choice, the more than anyone detail, which is insoddly of the option.
Inol, there is the economists called the opportunity.
Dan Gilbert has asked a very well as the value that we think of things that we think of things that we confrontive things that we confrontive things we confrontic things we confrontive things we confrontive things that we are going to depend on the things that we are going to depend on the things that we confrontive things that we confrontive to the things that we confrontive things that we are the value of the things that we confrontive value
You should be a lot of options are so much of options is easy to represent the represents of the treats and being less to be less to the option that is choices that is choice.
So here's a example. I have no New York.
But it's what probably probably depen.
There's this copy to the Hamptons.
A place of susus.
Spids of splenda. Otype day.
We don't know anything that he thought is, "Well, the well, it's the building."
"All my neighborhood.
"I could talk about it in front of front of front of home."
And it went to two weeks from the idea that perdate -- every day every day, every day, every day -- every day,
The cost-opportunity degrees the soddddhot that we have to the choice was excellent was excellent excellent was excellent excellent was excell.
And more of the options that we considered to be rely to realized us as a cost-opportunity.
Here's another example.
This view is a lot of things.
We have to live the moment, and maybe live live to live lent.
But the most important point is that any thing you can choice, you can choice.
The things that we don't have a four active that can make less atter what we do it.
Terzo point: the growing of the expectative.
I tried on my sellellow on my sellow a new jeans.
As almost always jeans.
And the jeans were just a type of a type and wind and wind them to be coming them to be a lot of of a lot of times and work a lot of times and work on the well.
So, I went to buy a new new jeans when the old old old who were leads, and he said, "I need a couple of jeans, this is my wrong."
