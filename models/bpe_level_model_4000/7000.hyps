The last year I showed these deal with these deal deal to show that the scale of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the United States, it's been in the United States, it's been in the 40-year-year-year-old old percent.
But the fact this subject of the problem because it is not a lot of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice.
The glacial is a glacial is in a sense, the heart of the climbs of the climath of the global warming.
It was going to go and reversion and it will be in the summer.
The next 25 years of the last 25 years.
The ice is the lens are dealing in the red reaches in the reach.
As you see it in the blue blue blue blue of the blue blue
That's the ice in the ice in the inver, which is going to be in the summer of the est.
You can see that the cosident of five years or five years or five years or five years or of the sought from the body.
In 25 years is going to go from this way.
This is a problem because the re-scale of the hand the ice of the ocean in the ocean article of carbon on on the ocean of carbon on the bottom of the bottom of the microbic microbic microbies.
And it is the totality of the inquination of the global warming of the global warming could be rained to the super-scale.
In some lagers in Alaska meters in Alaska meters on the water.
The professentiential professentiential of the university of the university of the university of the university of the last last last last last last last last dead.
Video: Wow! Lood: Look is what we are going to be a question of us.
And it's why this is that this scale of the normal reduce of the normal north.
This is a folks of the normal flow.
The ported had never reach to the devices of the side.
This is the Kangerlusssuather in the saving of Groenles.
If you want to know how the level of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice is where the mart.
These are increasing are increasingly.
On the other part of the planet: Anckars, the most block of the planet.
The last month of the scientists have died that the bizars is in a negative, and the Ancticticle of the saves on some isolar araround, which is particularly to the saves.
It was a six feet of the water, like Groenles.
South Himalaya, the third more block of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice were the folks were ice ice and the days.
The 40s of the population of the water of the water from the water from the sexual water from what the money.
SAnde: this ice is the foundation of the water water water water from this city.
The portraised is increased.
And then when I dimine it is going to happen.
In California on the Sierra Nevaa's on the 40-percent of 40-percent.
The idrices are in crisis.
The previsions, like you have a good job.
The growth of the world is a night night in the world of the sincens.
The environmental environmental environmental environmental environmental is increasing a normal and without precedents.
Sometimes I have more numbers in the last 30 years of the precedents.
This is a handing of the insustainable of the insustainable.
If you look at the context of the story, if you can see the constants.
In the last five years we add in the last five million tons.
Look at the area of Pacificer Pacific, from Amer, and on the Amermer, and on the subjects of the subject of the deal in the oceans.
The most of the global warming of global warming, and the deforestation, which is the 20, is the use of commoney.
The oil is a problem, and the carbon is lost decade is lost word.
The United States are one of two countries with more emissions, together with Cina.
And it was propond of the central paralls to coal with the carbon on on the carbon.
But we're assisting a change.
These are the projects of the last years and some of the last years and some of the deal with alternative deal with the deal with the last few of the last years and some of the last and some of the last and some of the last years and of alternative removes of the last and some of the alternative projects of the last years and some of the de
In every most, there's a lotty in our Path.
The industrial industry and oil oil have been exposed to the last year for the last year to promoon the carbon on the carbon on the last year to promoon the last year of the last year to promoon the last year to promoon the last year to promoon the last year to move the carbon on the last year to promoon the last year
And I remember me me me something,
Natal, Nata, in the Tennesthesis, where there was a perforforce of 3.8 billion of militaries.
Maybe you have seen on news on news ars.
This is the second big big flush of the most flying in America.
It's happened around Natal.
The teachers are the satalizing of the industrial industry.
Video: S: Frosty the carbon is a coal kind of coast.
It's about the honto America, and it makes our economy.
Frosty the carbon is always more pull of the cool of it.
It's a good good delights and the work work work --
Gor: The Gor: The coal of the West Virginia.
The most great society is Massey is Massey Coal.
Video: Don Bllennizennight or -- Al German EEEEEast Reid Reid Reid -- not the talk about what they're talking about.
The Gor: So the Alleance for the Clian Clian is a two payet.
This is a kind of essention to the parts.
Video: Again: The EOOOOOOOOOOO.
So our priority is investing a great amount of money in a sforce of money in a sforce to make it public and consumption.
In fact, the carbon is not spore.
We think it's a good -- it has also a good profums.
So not preocubats of change.
Let me do we do it.
EEEEEEEEEEEEven -- you heard of a lot of it.
So we do do this with a structure of the coal structure of the carbon on on the carbon on on the carbon on on the carbon on the carbon on the carbon on the carbon on the carbon on on the carbon on on the carbon on on the carbon on the carbon on the carbon on the carbon on on
Straordinary. The machine are a little bought to the sought of the carbon of the carbon of the carbon of the carbon of the carbon the carbon is a little bit of the carbon of the carbon of the carbon of the carbon of the carbon the carbon the carbon the carbon of the carbon
The mayster is between the most carbon is between the global warming and the nor technology that you can change it all the carbon on the global ward.
Dake a eye of the carbon is the coal technology of the carbon on the carbon on on it.
The Gor: Instead, the alternative deal with the economic deal with the economic res.
Video: S: The mention is in crisi; the economy, the economy, the economy, the crisis, the crisis.
The filter that the whole whole thing is the dependence from the dependence of the coal coal and oil oil oil oil and oil oil oil oil oil oil oil
Now, there's a new new remarkable to use solution for ushs.
The American: 100 percent of the energy of the country in 10 years.
A pieces to report America to work -- to make us more sure and helping us to reference the global warming.
Finally, a solution that basts to solve our problems.
The America. Scooker is more than the more.
Gor: This is the ultim.
Video: S: It's reach to the America.
One of the most of the most of the people who have have to the dependence from the planet.
S: The future is here here here is Vento, a new energy.
Nuzes are 2: Nuoven investment for places to work for work for work for work for retribes.
South America.
The Gor: A old properties said, "If you want to go to speak to the speak to the money --
If you want to go back to the back together."
We need to go back to the tex.
Thank you very much.
The last year in TED I had a introduction on LHC.
And it is going to reach to the machine to work on how to work on how the machine.
So I think it is. And for the other time you don't have no longer -- the most great experiment -- 27 kilometers never receive -- 27 kilometers of the conference.
The compic is to reactive the conditions that were present of a billion we have a billion we have a billion times on the universe -- to 600 million times a second at 600 million times a second at 600 million times a billion times at the beginning of the universe --
All of the environment.
This is the machine in Gineveve.
We take these deal these mini-Big Bang Bang in the reduce of the reducators.
This is what the work work is called ATLAS -- it's been 44 meters and has a diametets.
This is a picture of ATLATLAS in building so you can look at the proportions.
The 10 South Africa we have acceso the first time.
And this picture was taken by ATLAS.
It was because of immen, they have to control in control control of control control of control control
It's a picture of the first flowing particles that had this around the LHC, in the LHC, deliberately, with a part of LHC, and the saving particles in the reduce particles in the reduce of the LHC, and the World C, and the LHCC, and the L
In other parts when we see that the 10 September 10 September -- the machine that is a great liver lives.
I don't know if this was to do it on the other opposites of the opposites and I went on Google and I was this pay was this.
What we have had a scientific impact of the scientific cultural that is the scientific ded.
It was a week week of a week with the machine, I had to have this films here -- these films -- these films -- these films -- these films -- these films of these films -- these films of this films of this films.
These files are 13,000 feet when the machine work work to the massign of the potence.
Now, the technical technical technical and they are going to be a very subject.
And instead they can do it because they get the cosident cosident of the conductors.
So, in 271 grades, to a temperature temperature in the space between the spaces of the spaces can get that right now.
In one of the most of the most of the most of the LHC, there was a difets, there was a fricultural defrication.
So the files are going to take a resister and 13,000 miles have a resister resistence to met a resistence electricic resistence.
This was the result.
Now, this is still more impression if you think that these magnets, and they have more than 20 tons of 20 tons of about 30 centimetris.
It's dought about 50 magnets.
We had to get them to reach them, what we did we have done.
We have repristers and repristers and repristers and repristics.
Now, they're going to be hold all of their place to the right of their place in the tox.
I actually actually have the end of the LHC will be a new intrack.
We accend, and we think about the right right of the right or or or the right or or and continue to find what our own is the morning that are the morning that are the universe.
Now, of course, in some of course, these hospital debate the debate in the values of science and engineering the engineering of the engineering of the science of the science of education.
I think the fact that the fact that it's so difficult to go to the same time on the values of things like LC.
I want to conclude with the parts of a scientist, Humphrey is in the defesths of the insum of his own experiments of his pull, his pull, his pull, his pill, "Niiilove, "Niither the rest of the whole thing to the human res, and the science of the science of the science of the science of the human receiidents that we don't don't have to do the tribe,
Thank you.
I want to start to ask you to think about to receive the morning to the morning to the morning in the morning to the morning in the morning to ask the morning to you to get the board.
And you can see how to reach them and they get them to get them and they get them and they learn them and solve them and solve it to think and solve the space.
The reaction is to reduce to connect the way we understand much part of the world around us.
So, by inforce inforce from the ush of our interaction with the interaction of our interactive consummer, and my collaborative Pacac, and I started to ask Kalaniththania, I started to have the computer, I started to have the score of the psynthesththic deal with the smart of the puseful information to the smart of the same way to the same thing with a little bit with the information with the shape,
and systems to our mind?
The question was so interesting that I decided to exploring the answer, to build the answer, to build the Siftable.
And I talk about this, a Siftable computer is a computer interactive biquote as a biquote biquote as a biquote in the whole whole thing is a biququote as a biquote of the great as a biquote of a biquote as a biquote of the great improvid.
And I talk about this, a Siftable computer is a computer interactive biquote as a biquote biquote as a biquote in the whole whole thing is a biququote as a biquote of the great as a biquote of a biquote as a biquote of the great improvid.
You can move with the hand, they can see it in the hand they can see the movement and a radio wirel, and they have a radio wirelevening and radio wireleves.
But it is the nest objects like the morning as the morning can just get it to the hones.
The Siftable is an example of a new tools to the instrument of the digital information
And then they become more than the most people who are the movement, and they are more than the movement, and they become more than the movements, and they would be able to exploring new mothers, we can exploring new and we can exploration.
I will really, with some example.
This Siftable is configed to show you the vide: if you get it in a direction of the videoes of the bottom of the other side from the other side of the other side of the other side of the bottom of the bottom of the video.
These are the interactive interactive interactive activity of others.
If you are the ithy thing is their own intors.
If they are circummms, they can agitself a few 's.
If they are circummms, they can agitself a few 's.
They also have their movements and remarkable and remarkable and remarkable to the most.
And we realized that one of the interaction was the interaction of the interaction was the deal with the data, to example of the data.
In this case, we have three Siftable as a smart of the vernice and I can use them to the central of the central in the central place, where you get a few militted.
and I can use them to the color of the color where it goes to the central set.
If we are the way, we can reach a little bit of the way.
I'm also very exciting and a chance of the mathematics and games games that are the same way to get things that we can try and see things that quickly things like the results of the results of the results of the results of the article of the does.
Now I'm --
This is a sequence of Fibony that I do with a program program.
So here we have a game of the Scareo and Bogogen and Boggle.
Pratically, to every receive a literal case on every Siftable, Prrrent every turning of every turning in the Siftable, and while he was going to be able to a traditional vers on a framef of the receiight.
And after about 30 seconds of the sets and you have a new set of cars and new possibilities.
Thank you.
Here's the kids came to the Middle of the Middle Lab, I did it and I was made up and I was a video.
They are just a lot of it.
And one of the things of this gence is that you don't have to give you many people many educations.
You just say, "Have the worth of parole," and they know exactly what they do.
Here's another people who are doing it.
This is our skills more young anothers, there is a dealing --
And it actually wanted to just a crace.
They just morning ning to him.
Now, this is an applation of a interactive activity.
We wanted to build a tool-instrument for the linger of the linger is Flix.
It can insert new personal persons in the scene Siftonishing their associated with their associated associated with their associated to the Sififty of their associated to the Sififty of their own associated to the Sifty of their own own own associal.
It can insert new personal persons in the scene Siftonishing their associated with their associated associated with their associated to the Sififty of their associated to the Sififty of their own associated to the Sifty of their own own own associal.
That's what you get the sold sold and the sold sold
Video: The sold and it's surprise.
David Merrill: Now it has been taken a reactive in the scene.
Video: The sategy of the hat.
Bel work work!
So you go to the Sifty and put the interacting can interacting the personal person.
Video: Bau!
and it inventing the story.
Video: I love it.
DM: It's a story with the opening and it can decide it like he wise.
DM: It's a story with the opening and it can decide it like he wise.
Virir: Virirl.
DM: The last example I have time to show you is a tool, I did a tool, to do it for campions.
it's one tool, I did about recently, to the campioning and exede music.
The Sifty here are acting by the bacteria as a mostly and bactery.
Every one of these are four variations, and you can get to the way you use it to use it to use it to use it to use it to use it to use it to use it to use what we use use.
You can insert these sues in a sequence of your mindship from your minds.
And it just doing a toto-player a "sound and a "Res."
These are actually control from live in the live, as the whole fils.
The attack in a sum of the sets and then we reduce to the taps to the stand then they were going to the text of the sought to a sum in the street.
And then there are the general general time and folding to the interest sequence.
We look like this.
Video: DM: The Sife we will put a number in two Siftex, we get in a series, we add in a series, we add in a series, we add other expensive most.
Now I can actually have a bass.
Vide: DM: Now I add the percent --
Video: DM: And I put the bacteria, so I can control the way I can control the effect of the live.
Video: DM: I can speak the entire sequence of the whole time from a ladd of the other.
Video: DM: And I will add the right right to the most expression.
Video: DM: I can reduce the sequence of the sequence of the sequence of the sequence of the sequence of the sequence of the sequence of the sequence of the sequence of the sequence of the sequence of the sequence of the sequence of the sequence of the sequence:
So I don't have a suddenly suddenly suddenly the longer or more than the longer or more cort.
And now, I can swe'd smote the entire sequence of the Siftable Siftable to the Siftable "Fume."
Thank you.
So, you can see my passion is build new interfaces of the most important people like the most important thing to work as it works.
And today, I had time to show you one of the results of this perspective and some possibility that we can get out of the lab of the lawer.
The concept I want to put you is to get this new generation of objects to the digital objects with the digital projects in our world world in our world world in our world world in our world world in our world world that we want to get this new generation in our world that we want to get this new generation of objects in our world in our world in our world in our world in our world in our world in our world in our world in our world
Thank you very much.
I don't see the now of the time to talk about with all of you.
I am a write writer.
I save the books is my professional exsion is more than that, of course,
It's also the friends and the one of my life.
And I don't think it can change it.
And he said that, something like this particular recently happened in my life and I had to have a lot of realizing the entire relationship with this work.
The particular thing I was recently written this biographic called "Mangia, Prule, Prega, Prule, and the quality of my precedent of my precedents and become a great great month, and I went to the world and become a great framework in the world and the whole thing is a great foundation of the interventional world --
And the result is that everyone one people who are the people who were condition as if you were condition as if you were condance.
It is the true -- condition --
They are now now now worried and say, "You don't have a more to do it more to do it more to do it more to do about me?
You don't have to write write to write all life without able to create a book that can be able to create something?"
which can important.
It's real.
But it could go word, I remember what I remember I I remember that more than 20 years ago, when I started to say to people -- I was a writer -- I wanted to be a track.
I was in the same reaction of the reaction of the country.
And people say, "Who are said, "Don't get it?
You don't have a million reduce of the reduces of reduces to switch on the reduce of reduce to reduce the inner of reduce the reduce of the reduce of the reduce of the reduce of the reduce of the reduces of the reduce of the reduce of the reduce of the reduces of the reduce of the reduce
You don't have a paper to do this mestiant life without any life without any life on a heart of the morithths of every infrational skills with the mought of the saming of the dealing of failual failuments,
You know, you know it.
The answer -- the question is the question of all of these questions is """
O.I have been in the things.
I always had a pain.
And I also have been a lot of other things that people can't ind.
As the allow and other things that are respecting.
And then for how about the end I thought I was thinking and I asked me to me, why is is why is why is you do it because it's why is you do that?
It's it's raiz?
It's the only that anyone who deal to be deal to be below by a work that you have been to do it.
But what is that particular that is that in the imprese of the saves of the saves of the saves in a way that other carries in a way that other carries of the hannow?
And the father, for example, he was a engineering and I remember a one time in his 40 years of the only one time in his 40 years of the activity that if it was made to engineer to be engineering engineering to be engineering to the engineering to be engineering to be engineering to be engineering and I didn't remember what if it was a country to be a way to be able to the one one time to its own own to be engineer?
It was never -- that block of engineers who are in the engineer?
It didn't work on this point?
Onest, engineers as a group of depresent with sexual sexual reduction of being reduced to be allized.
We writers, we have this reducation, and not just writers but I think this reduce of every generation, we have this reduction of being expressed to be very representable to be very repressure.
And it's not really, you look at the tristers to deal with the magnitude of the magnitude that creative is in the 1th century, just in the 1th century and often often for them.
And the ones that are not the data that they have been really, to be really, disappeared.
Norman Mailer, before I was the last months in the last one was a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of more extraordinary of the work of the work of the work of the work of life.
But we don't have to say when we heard these things like these things really really really in the way that in some way we have interial represent the notion that creative creative and the notion that creative and the notion that the folding to the hanchchches and the hangiving the honto the sous.
And the question I want to do all of the thing is is the question of this ide?
And it's good to do this thing -- because you know, it is a hundred of distance to be a distance for nothing to do this exposition.
I think it's odied there.
And I think it's also dangerous, I want to see the next century.
I think it's better to incouuraging our great creative creative to live in ver.
And I think I was that in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to the end of the same kind of dealing the same kind of represent constict the circustance.
And I think it -- I look at the time.
I still have about four decade in my work in me.
And it's very likely to the fact that any thing in the world as the world as the world as the work that I used to get it after the last light.
I was slavery because we all have more friend here -- it's likely the most successful thing to my spalls.
Oh, Ges: Ges:
You know this is the gence of thinking that I was to start to start to the notion of the notion of the morning to the notion of the morning to do it.
I would continue to get this work that we do.
So, the question is the question is, what do you do?
And so I was a lot of reflessions, which the way to work to work to work is to write a costructural to create a costructural protent, right?
I have to find a distance of security between me, which I write my mind's written and my course, and my course, as I was going to get it in the last year to get all over the last year models on the time, I started looking at the time, and I started to find a lot of the best ideas and more more than we could have to see the best and more more and more more and more and the best and more more and the best and the best and the best of the best and the best we could get to see what if you could get to
on how to help people believe that the people create the inerate reduces of creative creativity.
And that research has been taken on the Great and antic Roome.
And you know, because it is the giving and then you get back back back to the back back back back back to the back back back back to the back and then it comes back to the back and then it comes back to the back and then you get back to the back back to the back back back to the back.
Nello Good and antically, Roma -- people don't seem to believe that the creative creativity that creative creativity -- right?
It was thinking that the creative that creative, it was a divine and that they were in the manages of men and they have a few of the distant and they know it in the distant and the sute.
The creative of the deal spirits are looking at the creative of creative.
Socrate, wonderful was a demone demone demought that elargives from the mountain of the mountain of the clear.
The Romans were the same ideas, but they call that that the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the wall.
The great diod, because the Romanananans didn't think that a particular genive was a particular intelligence.
They create a genial gency that was this kind of divil that I was living in the muring of the study of a little bit like the end of the study of the Robby, and I came out to the whole thing to the artice of the article of the article of the whole job.
It is the distance -- -- -- -- -- that is the distance of the parts of the parent that costructures and the results of your work.
And all of people who was so that it was so working on the right right now.
So the artists were protons were protons of them, how to example the narcives, noundnarcives, now?
If your work was actually actually actually held you could get to represent and all of the mer, all of the mers that had helping with this geniiid.
If your work fail, it was not all colord, right?
All of all the genive of your genive to be a inable inable to be a inable to be a inable inable inable to be a inable to be a inable inable to be a inable inable to be a inable inable to be a inable inable inable.
And so people han concepts the creative creative,
Then the Rince came up and all the same thing is going to be the great ideas, we put the center of the universe in the universe of the universe and the same stuck of the same creatures and the same creating to the detaught of the details of the universe from the details of the universe of the universe of all the same ideas.
This was the principle of human beings and people began to think that the creative, and the creative people begin to the ide of the ize.
And for the first time in the story, I think it is like this or that arrying this or that arrying with a geniiive person with geniid.
And I have to tell you that was a big thing.
I think I hope to put something, a simple person to believe that it's like a recient recivent as the foundation and the surprising people all the same stuck and the same kind of responsibility to the whole of the great filter of the human being.
It's like to ask someone to the saving of the solar sold.
I deal and the deal and I believe all these ingestives on the performance.
And I think it's this pression to have been been destruct in the past.
And if this is true, and I think that the question is, and it gotten question, and it is.
We can do it difference?
Magers back to a more understanding more antic to the human relationship between human and creative.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we can't get 500 years of thinking about 500 years of thinking about 18 minutes.
And there is people between the audience that would be represented to the notion of the scientific news on notion on notion on the notion of the sweather people sweather in their projects.
I can not tell you you to get all on this thing.
But the question I want to do is -- why you do that?
Why don't think about this way?
Because it has more than every other thing that has ever heard about expresent expersume to experpersues of creative.
A process that you have never recept to do something -- so so much -- so that it is not behavioral behaviors.
And, you can actually be completely parents.
I did this insum with the extraordinary Ruth Stone, which has now 90 years, but it was a few years and I was a few years and I said that in his own own life on his infectual Virginia, and I was going to be in the campaign, and I was a very except on the except of the henemy of the hesththesthththesia and I was a lot of the henemy and I was in the hace.
I said, "if it was like a fragorous flowing it.
And I came to the hold of her hour from her country.
I feel that they would go to the Earth on his hands on his flower on his flow.
You know that you have one thing to do to do that point and it was words like a morn."
And it goes to the home and it was initive to this poeth and it would have to get a piece of cars that you can get a piece of a piece of a flower and the train and the train and the paper the page.
Sometimes it could be enough to be very quickly as it and corporate and correct and correcent to the home and the poyons. And he was going to go through and she would continued to the hold through the hold through the helling through the het."
And then there were the piece of -- this piece of the fact I never will have -- there were the moments that was almost lost lost --
So, he was going to go home and he was trying to the end of the end of the end of the end of the hasn't a math that was when he was when he was the other hallungen with the other hand the other hand the arranging and the other hand the other hand the other hand the other halls on the hand the hallungen was in the waving and the hallungen and the hallungen and and it was was going to go into the wungungungone and and the
It was the code of the code and the code and it it was the western and the translate was the payone.
And in these mays, the poesia would be presented on the pay and I actually actually put on the last word on the last last deal in the first last year.
So when I feel about -- it's just the flower is exactly the represents of my creative process of my creative process of my creative.
Not all my process creative process -- I'm not a conduction of it.
I am a company -- and my way to work is swearing up to the same orders every day and go to the same and go back to the same forward.
But I love, in my head in my head of my head in the head, I was going to be on the way to be in the time.
And I think that also many of you can do it.
You know, even if the work and ideas were redded by a certain certain of the bottom, I could not do it.
And what is this thing, right?
And how can we have to get to the head of not do you get the head, and plute, which we can do it to stay stay on the does?
For how it really, the best example of the most contemporary I have the musican Tom Waits, I interviewed in the time ago for a newspaper.
We were talking about this, and you know, Tom, and the most of life is the article of the article of the article of the argument of the argument of these species impull species of these species of impull and reference to interive these species of these species of the arorizes.
But then you go back and I walk up and a day when he was driving on the mobile Los Angeles, it changed all of him.
It was going to go through the sent of this little framework on the little framework in his head in his head and it is the issues and the issues and the sought and the light, you know, it's really really like to get to should.
It has no piece of car, no longer has a lot of a record record of it.
So I began to feel this kind of old old hang is growing in his hasn't it to lose it to the song of this song of this song of the can.
I didn't do do it and I can't do do it.
And instead of going to go to the panic --
I was going to be the entire process and he was something completely new new way.
I just look at the end and said, "Yes, I said, "Yes, I don't see what I'm going to be driving on the right of you that I'm going to be on the right and said, "
"Who seems to write a song song --
If you really want to be a more opposition.
Some people in the important one one today.
To Cohen."
And his process work work on this.
I don't work was the work was still to the work was still to the job.
But the process, and the fish that the fish was releaving when he pregned when he prevent the geniive gence, and he had to be a dealing on the issues of the issues of the entire thing that had to be a whole thing to be a whole thing to be a whole thing to be a whole thing.
but it was a wonderful delights of a conversation of a conversation between Tom and this strange thing I was not Tom.
So how I feel that story that story is to change a little bit of the way I was working and already reduced a time.
This idea, I was writing when I was writing when I was writing up in a of one of the disperation of the disperation where we are working on something and we all when we are working on something and we can began to think that is going to be thinking that the book is going to be a book that the book is going to be the book that the book is going to be the book that the book is going to be the book that the book is going to be the book on on something that the whole book
not just good good -- I written a book I written a writer.
And I began to think of this project.
But then I remember the Tom I talk to the air.
So I put my faces on the hold of the hold and I would go to a angle of a angle of the stance.
And he said, "What if you know, you know that if this book is not the book that if this book is not internal in the phiilost no?
Because as you see it all I did that ho, I don't have more than this.
So if you want to get your best -- you can do your parts.
Okay, but if you don't know what I don't know about it.
I will be writing the same thing because it's my job.
And I want to say that I was been been been been been to do my parent for my parking -- the end of the North -- the end of the North Africa -- sexual people were going to be in the North of the North and music, and the music and music and music that were going to go to to to the sam.
And they were always magnitude because the ballers were professionals.
But every one of those artists have a next one of these artists become in the artists become in transformform.
And I know what you know is what I know you have a point of all of the point, a way, a performance of it.
It was like if the time you were all the ballery walk through a kind of ports and it was doing nothing to the only one one one one one one one one night of the saves of the saving --
And suddenly not just like a human being.
But it is a deal in and on the hospital of the divinced of the divince.
And when this next to the next pieces people know what they were going to be with his nobody had to his not.
They were the handle and started to clearning and they were going to cant, "Look, Doh, Doh, Doh, Doh, Doh, Doh, Doh, Doh, Doh, Doh, Dah...D.
That's God, you know,
It was a nouncy -- when the Mcccaged the Spay of Spana, they were this abricrices of the saves of the hah, Lah, Lah, Lah, Lah, Lah, Lah, Lah, you can still be in the body.
In Spay is when a article of the article and magic and magic -- and he said, "Lah, magnificent -- one of God.
And it's greatly because we have to have to have it.
Muth is the day later, for the day later, when you go to the hold and it turns out that are the 111.
It's just a deal with a lot of mal deal with the key never could deal with each other.
And maybe nobody cany the name of Dod still as I have to do with the rest of his lives?
It's difficult to it.
This is one of the recognization more pathy to make in a life creative.
But maybe it has no need to be so angoal if you could not believe it -- it is not believe that the most extraordinary, which is you have to be so you can be so much of you have to be so much of you have to be so much as you can be so much as you have to be so much as you can be so much as you have to be so much as you have to be so much
But I just believe that I'm going to be the data in prester that you have a kind of this hospital in your life that you have to get someone in your life when you have to get someone in the other when you have find.
And you know, if we think it change.
And so I started thinking about the time I was sure as I thought I was thinking about different months in the work of the book that I was a lot of the book that I would have been doing the great deal on my greatest dedeal on my big success.
And that I have to continue when I sent me to get to the elrized by this is, I didn't have been there.
I don't have to the artic.
Conducduces to presents your parts, any one can be there.
If your work is bally,
If the divince, I put the parts of leaving the lights of the share some kind of wonderful really, for a moment through the tural scene of the tural res, then "O!"
Some you tried to the same your dance.
And "Oh, you know, it is the house.
I think I think I was to teach it.
"Oh, you know, it is the same, even for the samor and it was a lose and it to get to really, really, to continue really, to continue.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
And you know I have been talking about some of these projects on the genome of human, on the genome of the genome of genes.
Now we're beginning to a new performan: we started digital biologists and now now now now now in a new new flowing in a new flowing of biology, designing and sweetizing life.
We always have tried to the great questions.
"What the lives?" is something that many biology I think they have to understand how many biology in the article of the lives.
We have tried different approach, reduce to the terms of ters.
We're digital digital of almost 20 years old.
When we have sequenced the genomum, they had been to the world from the world of the most biologic world in the digital world of computers.
Now we can regenerate the generate life life life on this universe from this universe from this universe to digital digital digital with this universe of the universe of this universe to the digital digital?
This is the map of a little organisms, Mycoplased with the genitalium, which is the kind of the genome of the little bit of the little bit of the little bit of the bottom of the bottom of the genome of the genome of the genome of the genome of the genome of the genoma more organism of the
And we have tried to reduce the genome of the genome of a little bit more little little bit more little bit of it.
We are able to the liminate center center of the most of the about 500 that are here.
But when we look at the map of his map to its map on is relatively simple to noc.
I think it's simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can limind, one to the time, it's very impossible to get a cellual cells that can get a cellual cells in the whole vision.
So we decided to do this is the only only skills to progree this mountain this mountain to the way of these questions.
And so we started the waving of the "We can sinct a mountain a mountain a mountain the mountain the mountain the mountain the momomostly flew a mountain the mountaining a mountain?"
It can be the impropers to do these great ecooking these great that we never had been able to create before it was going to create before it before it is to create before it was going to create the first order?
And in case it in case we can make a cool mountain a mountast?
A mountain is just a piece of material material to inert.
The speak with we we can get the life is growing the life is growing to the exponential exponential real.
Our ability to write the code code code and it is a lot of swealing and so it's improperly.
And our more recently recently represents on a current exponential current on a current of the most recently represents on a current of the most recently.
We started more than 15 years ago.
The process has asked many pass to the revision with a bioetic revision before we were the first experiments.
But we discovered that sinting the DNA is very difficult of the DNA is very difficult to the DNA
There are decade of thousands of machine that they get little segories of DNA, the long of DNA, the long 30s and it's a degenerative processes is the most game is the most game is the most gone.
So we had to develop a new metothy to the framework and corres.
And this is our first recept to our first digital information from the digital of the genome of P.47.
It's a little virus that kills that kills on the bacteria.
We have designed the framework in the ortural remain and get a lot of DNA of the DNA of about 5,000 literally.
The interesting is when we took this piece of material material and we put it into the bacters, the bacteria and we put it in the bacteria and reduces this code code particles and reduces the particles of the vires.
The particles are the viruses are releave from cells, and they go back and they distruct the Ecode.
I talked about the industrial with membrings of the industry was saying that they have to be able to the model that they have to this model.
They have reduced more than you know.
We think this is a situation where the software can actually build his same hardware a biologist.
But we wanted to do things in the greatest things in the greatest way.
We wanted to build the whole romosome of the bacterial bacteria.
And it's more than 580 miles of code code of code code of the code of code code of the most of code code of code
So we thought to build it in the bottom, the virus, so we can change the same thing to change the casses, so that they are the components of cellual cellure.
The projection is critical remainal information, and if we start with this digital of these have have to be accururt.
When we sequenced this genome in 1995 the first time in 1995 the only only one of a hospital hasn't a little bit of a hospital.
We discovered, 30 hours, 30 hours. If we were going to use that sequence that sequence we had never been able to do it work.
A part of the process is designing 50 bodies that you have a lot of the other people with all the other people who are with all the other people who are going to build on the little bit more little bit more than 50 blood of the working together.
We're going to be able to the same here.
You have a little bit of the flights of the flower.
Thaten the thing we have a genetic code on four literally les: C, CE, C, C, C, C,
And those those of those lens are in 20 friends about 20 friends and there's a specific requires to receive for every friends for every friends.
So we can use the genetic code to write parts -- I think it is.
What we did we have done to the beginning was authographic to be authographic to the beginning of the beginning was authographic to the beginning was authographic to the beginning was authographic to the beginning of the beginning of it.
Some were the fact that they were not a few that was no poets.
We have designed these segments for a few years to be able to be with miles.
There are the imal that reparts and they put them into the syms.
And we started to get up with the seggggggggggggggggges in the way to formate their own honto 24 hours in 24 hours to the literally 72 miles on the literal does.
And every past we have product these segments in the honto the same way that we're trying to create a proceide that we're trying to create a proception -- how you can see in a minute.
We're trying to automatic the process.
So, this seems the tabellow of a flower of the mostly of the most.
When we get these sexual sesexual sesexual deal al in E.
It's going to get the southology of the biology molecules.
So we have to get other months.
We know about another multi-scanning reducation called the reduce of biology is going to reparate the DNA to reparate the DNA to reparts the universe sed.
Here's a example.
This organisms, called Deinocock-ras radioooths, can have three million rad million rad of radiation.
You can see in the ridangerous as his mosometimes his mosome.
In 12 -- 24 hours is reassembled as it was the first of the first was the first of the first was the first of the first -- 24 hours is reduced as it was the first of the first of the first of the first of the first of the first --
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do it.
These organisms can sexual organism to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to red.
They can live on the house.
I'm absolutely sure that life is in space, and you know, and they are all the environments of water.
I say the NASA has showed that this journey.
This is a very picture of the molecules we built these processes these processes with the flower of the design of the design of the remains.
The lights them to the automatically.
This is not been been taken with a microscope with a microscope with a microscope rules.
It's a lot of the great that we can see the great that we can see the microscope with a microscope with a microscope with a microscoscope of a microscoscope with a microscope with a microscoscope with a microscope with a microscope of a microscope.
These are pictures that cover is about six seconds.
This is the adady we have done a few years ago.
And it's more than 58,000 mayster of code code of code code of code code of the most of code code of code code of code code of code code of code
It's the most great of a lot of a structure of a structure of men ever created by men
It has a lot of souse molecules in 300 million people.
If you have the samp with a career of the sphere are going to get 142 pages just to transmimit this code code is a genetic careful code that code is a 42 pages on the same way.
Now, how do we do it work?
Of course, the whole friend of a virus is a girls.
It's a little bit more complicated when they use the bacteria.
It's the most simple cells when it is the phananthroote as the nouncle of the nuclear and inserults of the nuclear process of a other, which is the process of the process of core cracking.
In the bacterial bacterial mosometimes it's actually actually actually actually flowed in the cells, but we have recently to do a trapic mountain to a very mountain to a very mountain to the mountain to the bottom of a mosome.
We have reduced a cool microbial mosome.
The two are different as men from the topi.
We have add some gene of the most of the way to get to this mostly to this mountain to this mostly flow.
The cholise with the insues in the kill all the protection.
And when we put into the cells -- and we put our grain -- and you can get our graphic graphic graphic graphic cells.
And we were thinking that we could go back to the way, but we could go to the community of the most in the less.
This is one of the most skilling of evolution.
We found that very antiy species have added a second or a third one third one third mosometime of a few parts, to a few thousands of new trates.
So who think about evolution as a gene of the time you have to the time you have no good part of the biologist.
They call the insues of the improstation of reductions.
The mother was in the cellual cells of the hell ell of it.
The cells of the hold hand we have inserable to the ha.
It's expresent and recognizes the other covery very mountain as it material as it has a masticklicens with just the cell cells and the new mountain the bottom.
It's become blue because of the genes we have insert.
And in a little bit of time all the caref of a kind of a kind of a special species are going to be transformed on the new species, and the new software we insert in the mobile phone.
All the protection are changed, the membrans, and when we get the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic refer.
Now, this may seem to be genetic with the genetic software we can change the things that in a very replace.
Now, I have explain that you don't talk about the genial of the progress -- but in the middle of evolution, and half years of evolution, and I said that maybe we're going to create a new version of the explosion of the explosion of the explosion of the digital process.
Why do you do that?
I think it's obvious when we're thinking about our need to necessary.
We're now now now now six billion people in the next year in the next 40 years.
Just for a example: I was nate in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for each one in 1946; in 1946; it will be going to be in 1940;
We're now now now now to find out to find a lot of free and binal and binal binal and half billion people.
It's still more difficult to do it for noies.
We are more than five billion barrasses, more than 30 billion bars of barry.
The one is a million barrent of barrasses.
When we try to find the biological process, or any kind of remain to remain to remain of the great challenges of enormous.
We need to represent all the emission of CO2 from these materials that you end up in the atmosphere in the atmosphere in the atmosphere in the atmosphere in the atmosphere.
The day of the scientific today, because we have a data in the world, we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I like to think that are the components to design the future.
The industry is a provide of about about about about about about about the whole thing you think about the things are are going to be in the fuels.
Our arms here are the principles of the biological objects.
Now we have the techniques of these metothization of sinting of the sinter of the folization of the combination of the combination of the microphiize.
We can build a big robots that can provide a million momosomes to the day.
Think of these 20 million genes of genes of different or to try to get the same processes to make it in the last 20 percent of the saving -- we can change in the last 20 years of a little bit more biologic c c c c c c c c c c c c c years of the last 20 years of the last 20 of the last 20 years of the last 20 years of the last 20 years of the month of the last 20 of the month of the last 20 of the month of the past of the past of the last 20 years of the past of the past of the last
And it's just a sexual security --
We can get to survival to survival survival of the carbon of the carbon of the saves of the savetc.
This is a instantanea few software are working on that we're working on to be able to be able to sexual species to computer.
Well, we don't know how to be a year.
We know how the genetic is their genetic code --
We're now focus on the carbon of the generation.
You have seen you who are explain the hetan's grased by the grass.
We have a second and the second generation that ushes are going to be a coal coast of the most deal with the most more valuable to the hot.
But the only way that the biologiologist can have a great impact without increasing in the most of food and the most of the food and the deal is going to transforming the CO2 in the first generate of the first of the first of the first carbon on the first of the most of the first generation of the first of the most of the most of the most of the generation of the last generation of the generation of the same generation of the most of the degrees of the month.
The light framework with the CO2 is a metodom in our discoveres in our discoveries in our discoveres.
This is a organism that we have dest in 1996.
They are the ocean is about 2500 meters of the temperature of the temperature of the water of water.
They create meters from CO2 molecules of energy.
We're trying to understand if we can indog the CO2, which can be transported to be transported to the CO2 in the carbon on on the bottom of the CO2 in the carbon on this process.
So we could be able to get to increase what we could be able to increase what the question of "What the vita" is Not the liver of the deal to remaypray -- we have the whole industry to the whole industry to the whole industry
Esattentirely If you can't do it from TED, where you can do it from TED,
It would be a main the main of energy.
And we are working for the same way to use the same metothoks to create vaccines of the antes.
You saw this year with the influence of the influence of a year and a year and a half a dollar, when it's to find the vaccine in the right now.
I think that it can change in the anticians in the antics.
Here's how the future could start to change change in the treatment of evolution, acception, acceuring evolutions, and I ended up with bacteria.
We're just so much from the people.
Our except to do in the way to live enough to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try and try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to get it to get to do it in the way to live enough to try to do it.
First of all of you can see the most powerful way to the new new new technology that we have to the Microsoft to the Microsoft on a water.
It's about a environmental environment, which you can interact is to the level of the deal with a huge amount of data data data to visual data
And we're seeing a lot of the great great gabyte of the digital photototoes with a little bit of the digital phiiithic images like we want to have the images like this.
And not importantly, how much the amount of information that we see how much we see how much these things are the great images.
Most of the photographs of the digital reports is a scantural re-scene from the Bible of Congress, and reententer in the games of the games of the games of the Bible of the Bible of the Bible re-feet in the Bible space.
It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that the prestations of a system of a lot of a pixel on your screen on your screen in any moment. It's also an architecture.
This is a book of the data of data not images.
This is Casa deal of Dickens. East of Dickens.
And you want to show you that is just to do a point and we can do a thing about general, to do a very representation of the head.
It could be a little bit a little bit of a book for a model electronic book.
Not the save.
This is a more extrack. It's a number of the Lardian.
Every very great is the beginning of a sexual century.
And it will be a very good and the beauty to read the version of a tracea of a quote of a quote of a quote of a very serious theory and kind of methy.
We also did something with the angle of this number in particularly to the Lardian.
We created a resolve resolve to solve the most more more than that you have a normal that you have a normal normal -- and you have insert the context of the context of the context of the content of the context of the context of the context.
If you want to see the cars of this automobile, you can see here.
Or other models, or even the specific species.
And this really is a few of these ideas to the site of the spaces of space.
We hope that this gentlemen, I went to other porches and other porches and other porches are not necessarily to be around.
Nulally, the map is one of the most of the most of technology.
And on this not want to even to say that we have contributes to get to the camp of this campe.
These are all the street in the U.S.
So now we're going to be something.
This is actually actually from the webs; you can go to the webs; you can go to the right right now.
It's a Photosny, which is called Photosny, which is two different technologies.
One is a lot of the other is a visual research project that is a very interesting thing to not a Noah Snaves of the University of Washington, with the Rick Snaves of the US Snees of Microsoon Resear.
And it's from the website, and the websites from Seadministration
You can see it when we do this kind of screens, where we can go from a picture of the other images and have this kind of experience.
But the collection of space, the images here has actually a meaningful meaning.
The algorititself to the computers have been on the computer have been on the computer images together, and so that the way that you can see the way -- all the way you can see the tagrices of the Montages of Montages -- all of the bottom of the tagages of the deal with the deal and the deal with the whole of these things that you can see the whole of these things that are the spaces of the space.
I don't know if I have time to show you some other environment.
There are a lot more space.
I want to go to one of the same data data to the Noahhot, and this protototo-precedent protom of Phototonthynthokny -- to show you what the first time -- to show you what the technology is really really really good to show you what the technology is the technology is not necessarily the environment.
We had to remain the legal and I say it is.
This is a rebuild in the Noth Dame Dame Dame Dame Dame Basta digital pictures.
So I all images that Flickr and there are all connected to space.
And it's possible to navigate in this simple way to the simply
You know, I would never have thought to work to work to work for Microws.
It's very gratificfiction to the kind of activity here.
I think you can see that is a lot of different kinds of different kinds of photoes of those photocks of those photoccurrent photoccurrent in this environment.
And if you can get the most stranother.
Many are block of the doctor, etc.
And there is a few part of photographs --
This is a place of Noth Dame Dame Dame Dame
We can go from the point of the physics of this environment.
The point is that we can do things with the environmental things with the environment. This is now now now is now to the whole whole of the interest of the whole whole thing to the point of the visual data -- and all of those data together.
All those pictures become connected together, more than the things of the things of the parts.
You have a model of the interest that emerge.
Think of this as the promote of Stephen Lawler Lawler on Earth virtual virtual of the virtual of the virtual work of the virtual of the virtual of the virtual of the most of the community.
It's something that growing and the people who are using it as they are going to use it and the uses that are going to get with the useful reduce with the useful and the use.
Their pictures are smart with metaphors from other people.
If you have the idea of the idea of the sets all of these skills of my photilos of Nototh DDesrral deal with all those dates, and I can use how to do you use this point in space, in the space, in the space, in the space, in the universe, and you have a little bit of the universe, and you have a little bit of the sam.
No course, a consequence of all of the virtual except of every part of every part of every interesting of the terms of the terms of the terms and some of the satellites and a million receiiidental memory and a million respective conversation.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I realized what your software you going to get to do is that your software are going to do is that in the next time, all the pictures of the world in the world or in the world or in the world or in the world or in the world or in the world or in the world or the world in the world or of the world in the next time.
BA: S: Yeah. What is doing is actually discovered.
It's creating the hyperlines if you want to do it with you.
And it's doing it in the content content contains of images.
The thing is really interesting if you think about the reduction of the information that many of these images of these images of these images of these images of these images that are a lot of these images that are a lot of of these images that many of these images of these images that many of these images of these images that is a lot of these images of these images of these images that we can res.
As when you do a research of the websites on the websites and the heads on the pain in in the pay of the picture.
Now, what happens if you have to all the voster of your fall?
So the amount of interconnects to interactive and the amount of remostly remostly is really enormous real. It's really really really really a very exciting effect.
CA: Blaise, it's really incredible.
BA: I will you very much.
One of the main the main when you live and a delife-and delilife-graphic dedeal with the antic antic antic antic antic antic antic antic reduction in the past, the told, in the today, the slew of the saves of the glass.
Basts thinking that the money, Jaguum are still on the Vy Lattea, or the Vy Lattea, or which is still colors, or that in Himalaya, the good distincinct of the Dharhardly red, to remember the most important of the Dhardnest of the world and the idea that we are just the world that we are the world and the world that we are just a sense of the world
the consequence of a particular choice to adapplative that our stirs has done it for a generation of generations ago.
And of course, we all share the track.
All right. We all remains.
We're going to get the beginning of the beginning of the beginning of the beginning of the starts to be the beginning to the starting.
We need to deal the inesorance of death the death and whales --
We all have a art.
What you know, the range is the rangle of the canzone, the ritual of every culture.
Not important, which are the last and the Borne, or the follow of the Voom of the Vood's desert Kaid's desert Kenya Kenya Kenya Curanang Cura, a Curganang of the desert of the desert of the desert of the desert in the desert of the desert of the desert of the desert of the
He was my company in the desert in the desert in the desert of the yet of the Western in the West Mex, on the world.
All of these populations are the other ways of the other ways of thinking about other ways of the world of the world in the world.
And if you reflech a time, it's a concept that can give you a few hope.
Insiass, the mirring of the world creating world creating a bunch of life and cultural and cultural is to the planet and culture is important to be as the planet as the planet as the planet as the planet as the planet as the planet and culture of the biological world as a biologist.
And you can think about this raild of this raild as a mountain and it can definitely represent the netnocle of all the conceptuits, really, reportions, and ideideiss, reported to imagination from human consumptions.
The Eetnossfast of human human human being.
It's the symbolols of what we can be in how we can be in how we can be in how much as it as a kind of inquise.

The reason is a land, by a laughting is in the fact that the same one value, it's prepreventing is preventional value.

The way to be freezing the choice.
The choice people are free, and more free, and more and more than their freedom is their own own deals.
This is so deeeded in the society that nobody had to put it in a little bit of it would be able to put it in a little bit of it.
And it's also reduced in our lives.
I'm going to show you some examples of what the progress has to reach it.
This is my supermarket. It's not particularly a great way.
I lost a simple nounce,
In my supermarket in my supermarket in my supermarket -- without contains of the preventing of the preventing and 12 acets, and the 12 acets, you can buy a huge number of conditional consumptions of constance that no one of the deal consumption.

Some of the world of communications.
And one time, when I was a child, they could all the services of the phone to remote that they were force by mostly mom by mountail.
It was the phone phone one is not buy it.
One consequence of that, between the other, and it was that the telephone is not a romous.
These are going to go into the time.
We have a various variety of the phone of telephone of telephone cells.
Here's the cells of the future.
My favorite is in a mechnology, MP3, and the nother of the nowwwing in the cryst.

Assister of the United States that you have more in the United States and the doctors and the doctors and the doctors that you do.

"What does you want to do that?"
And you rebacking "Dott" was what if she was what I do that?"
And the doctor: "But I don't have lei."
The result of the malony of malia of malony that it makes it a beautiful thing that it makes a beautiful thing.
But it is not that one smoves and the fish and responsibility to take the decisions of somebody who knows something, and you have no longer -- and so it's not a lot of the other other than not in the ideal ideal remotion to make the patient.
There's a huge remarkable of products of products like people like me and you know, if you think about it, and you think that if you think it's not a send that we can't buy it.
But if we can't buy it, because they can buy them, why they are they going to do it?
The answer is that they want to the doctors to ask the doctors to ask the receive to change the receive to the recepty.
So what we have to have our identity is our identity is a question of choices as you see it in this vision of the kids are the kids to get their own children. Sceery to the right right right now.
And we can reinventing us to the deal with a lot of grade.

On day, all of the player.
Insegone in students very intelligence, and they have 20-percent of a time.
And because they don't have a brilliant, because they don't have a diligents.
but why are are implants, I would ask you to ask you to get it right now, I would have to do it right now,
"Who I would have to think about the latest I had to think before I I had to think about the carririer?"
I'm interrogatives you there.
And they try to say these questions, even though this implic implic requires that requires that you don't get a bel of my esame.
And they have to really, we do it.
Now, the work work -- we are lucky, like Carl l l l technology to work every day day day day day day day day day every day day day of the planet, from the planet, the Eastal Randph.
I would go to parents, there is a angolind, and I don't want to have any one quality for the Withths.
I don't want to use it.
What does this incredible incredible freedom to work on work on work on work on work on the job, and we need to work or it.
We can go to see our board, with the cells of the cells in a pocket in a hallel in the other, and the noise in the key eyeyes.
And even though I have all the minute that we see our board, we are also asking the parent of the book, "I said, "I have to say to this called "Westerday I call it to this called ""Western to this called """What we see our boar?"
"I want to get this email? I have to do this literally l?"
And even when the answer is "no," all this makes the parent of your mind's minds of your mind's mind.
So, by any part of any things that we are little bit of the things and stils of life, life is a question of choices.
Of the world was this: Ovver, there were some one one of choices, but it was a choicy.
The world of the world today is this question: The dilemma is a positive thing is a positive thing --
The answer is Sw.
The position of the things we know that we are going to talk about the ones of the ones are the negatives.
And all this choice is two actually a few actually are two of the gents.
The artice, paradom is that produces are worris.
With many options are the options that you get to do it.
I can give you an example of a very conducted on the planets of thinking of the planets.
A removes of my data in the Vany data is the gigants, with a society of thinking of a million clients in the 2,000 companies in 2,000 companies.
What she discovered it is that for every 10 solution of the most offer's more, the percentage of deadesion of the deal adesion of 25.
With 50 percent of offers, there's 10-percent of deal in the deal when they are available to 5.
Because with 50 foundation that we hold up to the detail, and the choice is really, hard to really, it to the question.
And I still ask questions, and I think, questions, and of course, the questions, and of course, it doesn't get a mains.
You can only mean that these work work from the old old old hands for food for the sons because they don't have enough money money to say that the decision is so that they have to be so exciting the foundation of the data.
Not deded, they're lost to 5000s for the dator of the dator of working on the dator of work in the worth of work in the way to be bed.
So the paralizes is a consequence of the choice.
And I think it makes the world like this.
"And for the nititites: Wetchcher, seniiise and maining or maining and mainches or mainchicic?"
You want to take the decision is the right decision is for the nity of the nity of the nity of the nity --
You don't want to get the wrong wrong wrong, and neph the wrong wrong.
So this is the first effect. The second is that even though we could avavaving the paralizing and make a choice, we were at least at the result of how we could have with less options that we were in the hone.
And this for different reasons.
One of these is that with many condidies that you can get a different choices and you buy one and you have a different choices that you could have a different choice difference that would be better than the alternative of the alternative of the alternative to image and the delights of choice, and the reduce of the choice, and repression to the delilight.
And when it was a good decision.
The choice choices are going to be able to be able to be a details that is income.
And the one that economists call it expensive productive productive productive of opportunity.
Dan Gilbert has a lot of good stamine as the values we do the things that we do things that we do things with what we do we do we do to get the way we get to the things that we do to get to the things that we do to get to the things that we do to get to the things that we do things that we can get to the things that we do things that we do things to do in the same way.
First, when there are very many options that is a lot of represents to represents the phone of the alternative and be able to be able to be able to be choice.
Here's a example. I use with all the ones that are not New York.
But it's probably think that probably depend.
There's this piece of Hamxxxype.
A place place of the luse.
Spion splendid. Otty is all of them.
Not the nest thing that he thinks about the "Well, it's Ago."
"All my wife in Manhattan are in Manhattan are in Manhattan are living.
"You can talk about the cash of case."
And I went to two weeks on the idea that is lost -- every day -- every day -- every day -- the ability to be a way to be a way to be a fold.
The expensive opportunity to the sounds for that we have -- even when we have when the choice is actually been been been excited.
And the most are the options that we have to think more the careful cars are going to be able to be able to be as constant.
Here's another example.
This is a lot of things.
It talks about the moment, and maybe the live lently.
But the most important is that any thing you have to do not do the other.
The things that we don't have a lot of these are very attactivity that can make less attempt that we do.
The third point, spiral remarkable to the growth of the expectes.
I tried on my prain my pray a new jeans.
And she still still still still still jeans.
And once the jeans were a few later, they buy them and vestyers from the best, and they were sweet and they were going to go to a lot of time, they started going to go back to it.
So, I went to buy a couple of jewing when the old old of jeans, and he said, "I'm going to have a couple of jeans, this is my own own own cut."
The cover said, "Ls wants to the slide phasass, and I fing?"
Look with the night with the bottonishing botttonishshopping or ""Cace," "Why?
"Let it want?"
"Yet it wants to the blake or the blake of the blake was to adaddress.
I was a little bit later, and after a little bit of the guy -- I want the kind of -- he had the only one one guy who was the only one of what I was a way to do I have all the 'chans, and then the best of the negogotten and the best of the jeaneans, with the best of the jeaneans never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever I had been been doing the hemjeeeeeeeeeeeewy."
It was the massive choice that I had the meet I had the meet.
But I feel worst I was worst there.
Why? I wrote a book I realized to understand it.
The reason I was worst I was worst that with all that choice were the choice were swearing --
I was expectative minimes. I didn't expect when I was no existed -- when it was just a few of a lot of different different places, at 100 different kind of a different kind of had to be perfectly to be perfectly to be perfectly to be perfectly to be perfectly to be perfectly to be perfectly in the mind.
What I had watched was good -- but not perfectly
I was a little bit of what I was trying to do with what I was trying to do it in confrontal confrontal wait to the wait to the wait to the wait to the wait to the wait to the wait to the wait to the wait to the expectes.
The add adadd of the people don't make the way that these are respective cells to the cells of the options of the options are in the options that these are respecting.
And this provide will be a good dynamed when the results are good ones.
No one in the world of the marketing of the world's world
Because if you know what you don't know what I'm talking about.
The version is more than this.
"You know, it was worst when it was worst when it was worst when it was worst when it was worst or was still able to meet the previous premimimission to deal if you evolve the premimise of the premic preprize that when it was worst when it was worst when it was worst when it was worst or when
On the world where we live -- opulatory -- opuly the city, the representation of the perforforce -- the massive represent is that we can hope is that we can hope is the right of the expecting.
You don't have to be surprise because you have evolved because you know, my waiting itself and my waites.
The secret of happiness -- what you're here is -- "Basasn't it it go."
I mean, I mean a little moment I was resmote -- I was really, really, it was really really really really really really really studies.
I couldn't do meet meet myself I don't have a contented.
But it is not always a good thing.
I finally have to buy a couple of jeans scome, in when there is just that kind of jeans is that when you're not so much as you know, you know, "Why do you do that?"
"Who is responsi?" "Why," the answer is clear.
The world is the responsible questions I could do it?
When there are hundred hundred of jeans, and buy one insudden, and you ask you to ask you who is the responsible responsible or responsible or responsible or responsible to you are you going to be your responsible or responsible to you to be your responsible to you to be your responsible to the responsible that you are
You could have have to do meet it in the set.
With hundreds of variety of variety in the incenter for the inexpensive for the inexpensive for the incenter of variety
So when people really, people are decisions, even though the result is valizing and they were going to be able to their own hand they are the flower of their own hitself.
In the last years ago is explosion is exployees in the industrialized.
I think a fact that a meaning -- not the universe -- but important -- this is that the people have experiences that people have experiences because the standard are too alone.
And when they have to explain this situation that the colping is them.
So the result result is that in general general objectively, but we think about it.
Let me just remember it.
This is the dogen offical, what all we all get for good and it's not true.
There is no longer than a little bit of choice is better than you have to do not have to do that it's not going to be better than a few choice is better than a few one.
There's a critical value, a critical value.
But I'm enough sure we have super-piece piece of the level of the choice that choices our life.
Now, from the political point -- I have almost find, the one of the policy is the nocle is the follow.
What you can all this choice in the society is the remarkable material.
There are many places in the world, and you know you know about the problem is not that the problem is that they have a choice choices.
The problem is that they have too much of it.
So the factors that I'm talking about is a malespecial malessis of moderns, requires.
And that makes you depresent and array is this: Steve Levitt Levitt you about how those consticks of those consticks and swearing is a lot of money to the month.
I mean, these choices, you know, and you know, it's not just just ineating it.
I'm adadultures.
They do it worst is going to be worse.
If a little bit of what in our society has been reversed in those choices in those life has too much that they have to get their life to make it better than their life to improve the nouncle.
This is what the economists, they call a better better paretian improve dealing to the set.
A distributtion of reduction of the reddought to all -- because of this choice in the poor of this choices in except that we get us to represent us to the poor of this choice in the poor of the reduce --
To conclude said, "First, you can become all what you want to be the way --
Voes, people of culture, thought, "But what the fish is the fish of the fish of the fish of the fish of culture,
"It's obvious that you can't get anything in a bock of vetrow."
"First imagination of the month of the month of the month of the month --
and I interpretated I interpretated to the begin.
But I think we think about it, I I realized that the fish that fish the long long as a long ga.
Because the fact that if you get up to the frantural bocks in the way that "all the same way. It's not a good good good freedoes.
If you are the bock in the way that all become possible deminds the smodsssleft.
You get the paralizing and reduce the benef.
They need to have a sfer.
This is almost a lot of too much much as a fish for the fish for the fish for us.
But the framework is a few symbolic remain is a remain for infelicity and the rovine of the falls.
Thank you very much.
