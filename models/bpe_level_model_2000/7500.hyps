The year I showed these delilive to show that the calculate that the calculates of the glacial sizy size that the size of 40 percent, is reached the size of 40 percent.
Everything about this is the gravity of the problem of the problem of the ighborh.
The calculate glacial arty is in a sense, the heart of the climate system of global climate system climate the global climate climb of the climath climath of the climate climate climate the climath climath of the climate system.
It is expands and wind and it recent and they red.
The next deasic will be a rapid of the last 25 years.
The games are recogned in the reached in the reals.
And you see it in the blue blue to the blue blue in the blue blue to the blue blue blue in the blue blue of the blue blue of the blue blue to the blue blue blue the blue blue blue to the blue blue ble.
This is the game, which is the wind in the wind in the exted.
You can see that the coded of the game, five years or five years or five years or five years or excited by the points of the time.
In 25 years is spent 25 years is there.
This is a problem because the lacive tor of the lacied in the ocean armed to the ocean arms of carbon the ocean to the floors of the brobi.
Rished to the totality of the inquination of the inquantity of global inquantity could be a lot of the global point of not ritor.
In some of some of the sources of Alaska hand the he's already rebodies from water.
The professored Katey Walter Walter of the University is recated with a team is recent a team of the U.S.
Video: Wow! Al Gor: Yeah, it's going to be now. The question is if you will be now.
A motively motively resurrational land of the Groenlands from the north.
This is a glacial recording to the glacial glacial.
The brated was not reached to the six billion
This is the physics Kangerlussix in the sounds of Groenland.
If you want to know how to do you know how the level of the iact of the iacross us to get the source the smare.
These are involved indamentally inspirations.
In the other part of the planet: the largest block of the planet.
The month of the scientists have dichied that the lands of the game, and that the Antars of the Earth. And that the Antards, which is particular the sources of the same.
Evven in the water of water, as in Groenlevel of the water, as in Groenlevel.
Some Himalaya, the largest block of the ighborhimalaya, who were the laghs, who were the laghoes.
The 40 percent of the world's recognize of the water of the water of the water of the world's population of the world's population of the world's population of the world's population of the world's population of the world's population of the world's population of the world's population of the world's population of the world's population
South Ande: this is the same. It's the source of the water of this city.
The brath is hope is the author.
But when you diminuished the same across the same across the water of the water poundly.
In California on the Sierra on the Nevada is diminutes of 40 percent.
The dines are in crisis.
The previsions, like you've got a lot of them.
The creating of sumer in the world to a nice in the world of the instance.
The disaster realing a recognized by the normal and without of the normal sources.
Four times more number of the last 30 years to the last 30 years to precedents 75.
This is a source of all insteny.
If you look at the context of the story can see the consequence.
In the last five years we add 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 million tons in the oceans in the oceans in the oceans every day.
Look at the right area of Pacific area of America, data from America -- in the U.S. and on the continent in the continent of the subject of the ocean.
Most of the global warming global deforestation, that is the usual deforestation, is using the us.
The oil is a problem, and the charge is perse.
The United States are one of the most emissions, together with the Cina.
And you have to build a lot of other centrate of the bons.
But we're doing a changing changing of the exciting of direction.
These are the projects of the last years, and some of the last few of the last few of alternative and of the rest of the real rest of the last years.
At every time there is a lot of politics in our Paese.
The industries of the oil and the oil have been expect 250 million dollars in the last year to promove the carbon the last year to promote the carbon the last year.
That image I image me to something,
I know Nath in the Tennesses, where I live, where I live, there was a million litererers.
Maybe you have seen the news.
This is the second largest of the largest in in America.
It's happened to Nath Natal.
The public public of a clustery of a charge of the nath of the natals.
Video: Oh, now, but I know the carbon is a kind of slips.
It's a lot of here in America, and it's going to grow our economy.
Frosty the carbon is always more point.
It's a good price, and the workers and the workers and the workers are the game.
Al Gor: Do here is the bone of the West Virginia.
The largest society is Massey of the world's Massey Coal. This is his friends.
Video: Don Blkenship -- Al Gore, Al Gore, Nancy Pelolog, Harry Rid -- not know what they're talking about.
Al Gor: So the Eastisis: So the Proteation of Clim is a two camp.
This is a part of excited a party.
Video: All ll right. As we see the climath of the climate changes like a minm of our business.
So this is our priority is invest a great amount of money to a great degree of money and confuses and confuses the true.
In fact, the carbon is not spore.
We think it's a good -- it has a good properse.
So so that we don't precupated.
Let me do to do now.
Video: Ack: Carbone can talk about a little bit about a lot of a lot of it.
So we do a game in a focused in a focused to be as about how to do it about the carbon the carbon the carbon the carbon the carbon the arter.
Straordinary machines are a little bit of the characters of technology of technology of the technology of technology of the technology of the technology of the carbon the carbon the carbon the carbon the carbon the machines.
The consuming of the major of the main the rescale of the global technology of the bones of the carbon that you see the rest of the carbon all of the artical around.
Do a choice, this is the odiern technology of the carbon the carbon
Al Gor: The fine, the fine, the fine, the finding of the economic issues and the economic issusue of the national national economic national source.
Video: The America is in the America is in the economy, the economy, the economy, the national economy.
The film that college of all the the-foot from the combined by the combons were and the oil and the oil and the oil and oil il il and the oil is the important.
Now, there is a new audience for usual usual instance.
Repty America, 100-percent of energy energy --
A piece of the America of the work in America to work out of the work, and help us to help the global data to global the global data to the global reals.
Finally, a solution that you have to solve our problems.
Reads of America. Scoy of it.
Al Gor: This is the ultim.
Video: Soman: It's about redangered energy to the America.
One of the more than the fastest of the dependence from the combbbuckles that are our planet.
I says, the future, you know, a new reseque, a new energy recyce.
Anything about 2: Novoves to the investments for places for places for the places of the behaviors.
But I mean, Reash is a time of being realists.
Al Gor: A old old old old me to say, "If you want to go to the him.
If you want to go to the top together."
We have to go to the top fast.
Thank you very much.
The year to TED fect TED photograph on the LHC.
And they promise to get to add you to get to the hours of how works.
So I got the other time that the other time that the other time there is the most time there is the largest experiment of the most experiment of conference.
His to recognize the conditions that were less than a billion of a billion second of a second of the universe -- in 600 million times to 600 million times to the second.
All of the simply of it.
This is the Ginevated.
We photographh these mini-Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Big Bang Big Big Bang Big Bang Bang Big Bang Bang Big Big Big in the relevators.
This is what I work on the ATA, is a ATAS -- it's 444 meters and has a diamet.
This is a picture of ATLAS in AS in building so you can see the proportion of the proportions.
The 10 settember of the scored of the first time for the first time.
And this picture was a picture of ATLAS.
It was to immense of immense in the heads in the heavy of control in the heavy of control.
It's a picture of the first of particles of particles that had all done of the LHC, and deployed in collision, with a little bit of the LHC, and hard ard particles and the relevator.
In other words, when we see that image the 10 10 settember 10 settember that is a great life.
I don't know if it was to do more opening to us more opening to do that, when someone on Google and vidence that the page.
What we had a cultures that we had a cultural impact.
As a week down, there was a problem with the machine, it had to these files here -- these files here -- these files.
These files are 13,000 ample when the buts works about the myself of the powerful potentially of powerful powerful as the machine.
Now, the technical technical movies and the files and dirance and the dirt."
And instead of because when they are very quickly become the cody of the surgers.
So, in less 271 deed, in a temperature of the inference, these files can bring that the movies can bring that corrup.
In one of the most emila of the most emila in the LHC, there was a found of folding found out of folding found out of the most emiployed of the most emiploy-f.
So the files of the realong to read read read and the 13,000 ample of the sky resistance of electric.
This was the result.
Now, this is more impressions if you think that these magnets are about 20 tons of 20 tons and there are about 30 centimeters.
There's damn about 50 magnet.
We had to be able to listens, what we have done of it.
We have realized and the right right and the right right right here.
So now they're going to go to all their place to the ground.
Entrue the end of the marzo the LHC will be new integry.
We can accepty to keep the way of data to keep the data or or or glue, and continue to find out of our wavaily to find that are the universe.
Now, of course, in a certain a certain the time, these imagined involved the disease of the science and the engineering to the future. It's easy to connection.
I think that the fact that it's so difficult to go to the limits, I think it's the values of the things like LHC.
I want to tell you with the words of one scientists of a scientist, Humph, which is a lot of the inusually inuse of the inusing inusing experiments of his poll, the one of his hopen was a lot of the humans of human minds of human minds of human minds that are not a humans of the humans of the sources that are of the windities that are not seques that our minds of our minds of our minds of course --
Thank you.
I want to start ask you to rethink about how to do you can go to the kids -- you know, you have a little battacks.
And to understand how to realize them and they found them and flies, and we can make them and move to think about and resolving and resolving and resolving and hands and and hands and the policy of space.
The reasons is propertive connected to the way that we understand that we understand that we can understand.
So, by the inform of the elech of our interaction with the elects of our interaction of my consult and my consult of the Earth, and I started asked to assumer the information of the sources that are a computer in the source that we have the sources that are of the sources that are in a sources that makes a little bit of the information of the information of the information of the sources of the information of the sententence,
and systems our place of our plement it?
The question was so interesting that I decided to explore the answer to the Siftable.
In fact, a Sifty, a Siftable computer is a big interactive as a big big birds.
In fact, a Sifty, a Siftable computer is a big interactive as a big big birds.
You can move with the hands of it, can see the lor, in the hor, and they have a screen and they have a radio wireless.
But the fast, are objects as the mattones, as the mattones, you can move simply to simply it.
The Siftable example of a new ecool of a new information of the information of the information of the information of the information of the information of a gital information of a new information of a new information of a new ecool of a new ecool of a new ecool ecool of a new ecool of the information.
And the matter become more physics, consciouss, of the other people, of the others, and the other people, and they become more of the reasons of the other people, as we can see the other people, as we can see it, we can exploring new and fun and fun and fun and fun the tor of the interaction.
I'm going to go with some simple example.
This is configured to show the video to show the video video gured video game, the video game.
These are the reactive interactive of the others.
If you do them in the face thing about what their intor.
If they came up to the data, and can recognized a little bit of them.
If they came up to the data, and can recognized a little bit of them.
They also also have their motion and cline.
We can realized that one of the interaction of the interaction of the interaction of the interaction of the data, as a clip of a clip as if it was a liquirement.
In this case, we have three Siftable configured as a cyces of the colors of the colors in the centry, where you can use to be clear.
and I can use them to be able to the color, where you are ask themselves in the centry.
If we can do that, we can reput a little bit of a little bit of it.
There's also beautiful and you can take instance, as the language and the mathematics and gy-gics and gype to try to try to make things that you can see the results.
Now I'm --
This is a sequency of Fibonact that I do with a equations.
So we have a players that is in the Scarabeo and Boggle.
Pratically, to every crazy a land in every Siftable, Procrate, in every Siftable, Protable, and as a land in the Siftable, and as you can understand a side of the control of a dience.
So after about 30 second of the resimilar of a new set of lack and new characters of them.
Thank you.
Here is the kids came in the Middy Lab, I did it in the Middy and I did a video.
They have a lot of it.
And one of the interesting of this gence is that we don't want to tell you about people to give you a lot of people to give you a lot of people to give you a lot of the things of the things of apply.
I have to say, "Well, the words, and they have to do that, and they are exactly what do do.
Here is what they tried to the people who are going to be there.
This is our best head of course the most object to described there.
In fact, it was just imple.
They just have a Chinese are just flums.
Now, this is a characters of a interactive interactive interactive interactive of a car.
We wanted to build a tool for the lings of the lings of the Lui is Felix.
It can inserve new choices in the scene, solling the Siftable to their associates.
It can inserve new choices in the scene, solling the Siftable to their associates.
So it's doing using the solving money.
Video: The sole is source.
David Merrill: One is a choice in the scen.
Video: The ish is arancie.
Bel work! Sh!
So I can get the Siftable and we put up up with the sames can interact to the people.
Video: Bau!
--
Video: Cia!
DM: It's a story with the final history and can decide as you can decide as you square as you square as a fast.
DM: It's a story with the final history and can decide as you can decide as you square as you square as a fast.
Video: Vide:
DM: The last example, I have to show you is a time of recently, to be recently, to field and exesive music.
It's a tool, realized of recently, to field and exeply music.
The Siftable here is a basis like the basically basis and the battery of the battery.
Ognize of these four different variations, and you can get to use what us.
You can get these inserve inserve in a sequence, in a sequence.
And it is the simply simply to a choice and a sequence."
These are effects that you can control from the live and the film and the film and the film and the filter.
And I have to a particular and then including and then including to add it.
And then there are the effects as time and time, and you want to be in the sequence.
We look at how it works.
Video: D: Well, we incertain two Siftland in two Siftland and we can see in a serious serious system, we add in a serious sily.
Now I put a bassy line.
Video: D: On the only of the top of the useful --
Video: I'm going to put the film to the movie the filter of the level.
Video: D: I fasty the entire sequence, in the other side of a time from a time from the other.
Video: I'm going to get the movie of the movie of the based to drive more expression.
Video: D: I can rerefours the sequence.
So I don't have to stopped the first time, but I can try to make a more or more or more or more or or more or more or more than the corty.
And finally, I could be sfuming the entire sequence, in the squence, in the Sifttable to the Sift."
Thank you.
So, as you can see my passion is building new interface in the other machines as we can see our brain and the body.
And I had time to show you a time of the results of this percords of this percords to bring out of the laboratory that we can bring out of the laboratory.
The concept that I want to get this new generation of objects of objects of objects to interact with the media digital technology that we want to do in our world that we want to do.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the one of you talk about all of you.
I'm a writice.
Scrisis of the books is my profession, but it's more of this --
It's also the friends and the fasash.
And I don't expect that can change it.
But I mean, something happened to be happened in my life and in my life and in my life, that I had to recently recently to recently the entire of the entire recently
The thing that I recently have to recently this book, this book, this biography called "Mana, Ama" the whate, the quality of my precedents to be a big cedention, for some reason to a big ceducational interational interational interational international interational interational ational recently cutional books,
And the result is that everybody else to them, people are like if they were condence.
Davo -- condence, condence, connected --
They are now now to me all worried and I said, "You don't have to be able to do it to do more than to do it?
You don't have to keep writing to writing the life without of life without of a book that can be able to create a book that can important somebody to somebody to somebody to somebody to do you can get somebody to be able to write to go to to to be able to writing a book that to be able to writing a book that can be able to keep a book that can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to create a book
that can be to do that somebody else to somebody else to somebody else that can we have to do anybody?"
It's rasically.
But it could go to the game, in the most 20 years ago, when I was begin to say about the people -- I wanted a adolescent -- I wanted to be a writice.
I memet to the same reaction from the country.
And people say, "I don't have to have happened to have happened to have happen?
You don't have to be the billion of the refourth of the refourth of the refour?
You have to do this mester to do this mests all the life without of the life that nothing out of the mests of the mests of the frandom of the frandom with the broken of the energy of locing energy to the energy of the sources of the sources of the sources of the skills of the sources of the sunches of the spread of the sources of the spread
So you know about it.
The answer -- the short of all these questions is all these questions is "Si."
I have to be in all of of all the things.
I always had to have a putting the time.
And I also have a lot of other things that people don't have to ine.
And as the games and other spentered and other spent.
But what I was about the writing that I thought and I was asked me and I asked me because it is.
It's rational it?
It's a logical who are expect to be often to be often by a work that you spread for it.
But what is so particular in the imprese of creative creative to be able to save us to the saving of the instead of the reality that other carried in a way that other carried to be able to be able to the rest of the realtities that are going to be able to recording to the source that are that other carried to the source of the saving of the skid?
How do my father, for example, for example, and I don't remember a time in the 40 years of the time in the 40 years of the activity that was asked to be asked to be assumpter?
Do was never -- that block of the engineering John, as well as well as well as well --
It wasn't work?
Onestly, the engineering as group like group as wing in the sources of the reputation of the reputation of the reputation of the pressure.
We have a written this reputation, and we don't only have this reputations, but creatic creatic reputation of being reputation of being reputation of being inmentals.
And not rest that look at the triste of the death of the death of the magnified that only in the windn-sources and often to the hours of men and hour.
And that is that there are not recognized to be really, they were actually made by their woms.
In the last Mailer, before in the last 10-point in the last interview of my book me a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the work of the work of the work of the work of their life.
But we don't have to feel that when we heard these things things that we heard these things things that we have been interiors in some way we have a lot of the nance and the nice of the square in some way that art of the arts, and the arts, and the foot that art is going to be a scientist.
And the question I want to bring all of the today is that you are going to do with this ide?
It is the bad thing -- because it also look at a centimeter of a himeter of a himeter of the point.
I think it's a deep hold.
And I think it's also dangerous and I want to see the perpetually in the next sesynthy.
I think it's better incording to our big minds of creative creative creative our big creative creative creative our big minds of the big minds of course to the big mind.
And I know that in my case -- in my house -- in my house -- it would be a lot of deeat that time, they heard that they heard the circumstances that are in my carera.
Of -- inquite a young young young young years.
I have about four decar decar in me.
And it's very probable, that that anything that I will be in the world as writing from the world as the world as the world as a job that using the next thing about my book.
I'm going to be a little bit of the most of the right right here -- it's probable, that my greatest is the middle of the midddle of the midddle is the midddle of the right right right --
Oh, Gesh is that I think about it.
You know this is the gence of thinking about a person who bring a person, and I want to do to the nine and I don't want to do it.
I would continue to continue to do this work that we have to do this work that we do.
So, the question becomes to the question?
And so I can see a lot of refless, that the way of work to continue to continue is to create a copsychological copsychological copsychological cook?
I had to find a distance of sure of sure that I'm writing to me, and my natural food is about what I was going to get E, as I was trying to get E, as I was trying to do it to look at the time to look at the time, trying to look at the time to look at the time to look at the time to see if you can have more and more than they could have a more and more than the santh.
as we can help people creative to creative the inerents of creativity.
And that research me to the amount of Greciate and Roma.
Seguitems because I went to go back and then it back to the hand.
In the antics of Grecia and Rome -- people don't believe that creativity that creative creativity to the managed of humans, OK?
It was thinking that creative that is the spirit of the divine and that was seen to a few people who came out of a little bit of a foot and foot and foot and connected to the reach.
The greats were called these dives of creativity of creativity of creativity of the creativity of the creativity of the creativity of the creative creativity.
Socrate, wonderful of course, created to have a demer that was character.
The Romans were the same idea, but it was called that species in a genie.
The big thing is that the Romans were not thinking that a genies that a genie.
They have to have a genies of the entity of the entity of the vines that you credevine in the murs of a little bit like the elfour-like the elfour-foot of the work of the around, and the idea of the around, and the work of the argue of that work.
Existry -- that is the distance of which is the distance of that -- that copsychological that protects of the crunning of your work.
And everybody said that was so that it was so that it working, right?
So the artists were protype of certain the example, as for example, right?
If your work was exceptional work was that we could take and all the markets that were help by this genies that was help by this genium.
If your work was not all the cool work was not all the colps of your right right right right right no?
All of all of the guy that was your genies to be a incapace.
And so people have concept the creative creativity in Occident for a long time.
And then the Rinstates and all of the changes of the big idea; we put this great idea; we have the human human human beyond to all the hands of the grounds of the grounds of the creatures that they writing from the divinity.
This was the principle, the main the human eximent and people start thinking about thinking that creative creativity from the ished.
And for the first time in story, you know, you get to this or that is like a genie of the arguy as a genie.
And I have to tell you, I think was a big same.
I think I think about something, a simple person to create a charge of creatic belief as the foot and the source and the people of all the mistern and inconnected and the source and the reality of the square too much of the square that human.
It's like to ask someone of engineing the solve.
Deform and distores and creates all these expect and creates on the performance.
And I think this was this pression to the artists in the past of the the around.
Well, if this is true, and I think that is, and I think that is a question becomes and or?
So we can do it different?
Mactors to a more antics of the relationship of humans and my creatic relationship.
Or maybe it down.
Maybe we can't cancer, 500 years of thinking about 18 minutes in a 18 minutes.
And that is probably have a public that would have a characity, that would be a scientific neighborhoods, which is that they following the fourth of their projects.
I'm not going to tell you all about all of this thing.
But the question I want to bring is -- because we can do it?
Why don't think about this in this way?
Because it has more sense of every other thing that has ever heard for explaining exexperting except of the creative process.
A process that is that as anything that you have ever ever to do something -- so much -- so much -- so much -- everybody here --
En, it can seems to be completely paranormal paranorm.
I did this instates with the extraordinary with the extraordinary poety -- that has 90 years, but that was a poet, but that was a little bit of the influence of the influence in the walked in the field of the walke, and I had a little bit of the countraveling the countrace.
I said that was like a frage of the arian of the aria.
And that was recognize the lands of the country.
I feel to get to the land because he was going to get the land his piece of the building.
It was a way to have a money thing to do that point and he was death to say, "Why do you can do as a matta."
And so it was to the house and and it was inking this poesia, and it should be able to make a piece of cars and a piece of cars and a broad and a cool and the past, and the past, and he was the past.
On three times could be enough to be enough to be enough and recorree and recorrecorres and the poets and the poets and the poesid and the perhaps and it was going to get the country, trying to get the country, like the country, as a little bit of the other poet."
Then there were those times -- this piece of -- this piece of -- there were that -- there were a moments that the states that was almost perdrive to it.
So, he was recovered and he was trying to get the charge and the poess, and the past of the past and he was a math in the walgased in the wind and then he was like with the other hands and the hand.
He was the polled poesy from the cool and the reality and the realm and the top.
And in these things, the poess, the pollage of the perfect and intact of the last last last last last the last last last last last the first time to the last last last last last last last last cool the last last cool of the last last last last last last cooks.
So when I think the thinking, it's a country, exactly way.
I have no matter to -- I'm not a condutting --
I'm a mule, and my way of work is to work with them, and I see it in the same order every day, and to go and go to the up.
But I love to my head of my head or the game, I was a time.
And I also image of you that many of you have a done of you can see the han han han han han han han han han han han han han han han han han
You know, if the work and ideas and ideas and ideas and the ideas I could not extremely hundred it.
And what this thing?
And how we can can relate to be in the way to do not do the head of it, which we do us to remany, that we do it in the sanie?
So I can look at the best example, or example, I have is the musics to Tom Waits, which I interview for a day.
We were talking about that, and you know, Tom, and you know, Tom, for the major major main the argument of the arguy of control of control of control of these species of these species of creatized creatized creatized to creatized these species of the information of the care of the incarnation of the artical arter.
But then you invent it to the walked up and a day as he was drive on the hydrow from Los Angeles, and changed all for it.
It was just quite quite quite a little bit of a little bit of a little broad, that we realized in his head as the sky of the sky and you want to take it to the ske, and you know, it's wonderful as you wouldn't understand it.
It doesn't have a piece of cards, not a mathematic, it has a recorner.
So I started to feel this kind of vecky is growing in the time, "I'm going to lose to perder and remarried by this cancer.
I don't have enough to do it and I can't do it.
And instead of the banic in the banic stop here.
I'm going to go to the entire process and it was something completely new thing.
I can go out to simply the sket, and he said, "Scush h that I'm not dy?"
"To seems to writing a canzone down.
If you really want to be back in a moment when I can take a more opports when I can take a totot.
One of the important to be a important thing else to someone else today.
I have to disturbing Leonard Cohen."
And his process to work with this was a changed after this.
I don't have the work, the work was still as a seem.
But the process, and the fish is that we have been release when the genie, the genie, the genie, the genie, that he was seen out of the problems and the other that I had to be a realized by where I had a whole thing that had to be a whole thing thing that was a whole thing that was a whole thing that was a winstated.
but it was this piece of the wonderful crashed a conversation of Tom and this strange and this strange and that he was not Tom.
So I feel that story to change a little bit of the way I was working and I was working and I was already a tremendous times.
This idea, I was writing when I was writing "Mangia, Ama, and Amaky in a of those care of the disperation of the disperation of the disperation of the people that will be a saying that is going to think that is going to think that is going to be a disaster to think that is that the game.
not just bring the pigggamor book --
And I started thinking about this project to think about this project.
But then I recognized me to talk about the arrooms and tried to us to the air and try to get us to the Enm that I have to talk about the Tom that I talk about the arms.
So I have my face in my face and I would say, and I would say, and you have to a angle of the stands of the room.
And he said, "Sent, "Sent, what we know about that, what we know if this book that if this book not not be a little bond?
Because as I see that I'm going to put all that he's not more about this.
So if you want to tell you to tell you and you to tell you and you to do your own own you.
OK. But if you don't know that, you know, I know about me, I don't know about it.
I'm going to writing the same because of my work.
And I want to do to favor that I was recording today I today I was a little bit of the North -- -- the end of the North of Africa in the North of Africa in the North of the North of the half of the sacks, and they were going to go to the bad and and the sacks and at the hours and the walk.
And they were always magnific because the ballers were professionists and were fantastic.
But every tant, something happened to -- and one of these argus become in in fact, and one of these around.
And I know what you know about that, because I know that you have a certain a certain a certain a performance there.
It was as if the time you stopped the walery and the ballery of a kind of bring a kind of set of the solid of the solit, as 1,000 sources of the suntil of the sun.
And in the suddenly as human.
But you get to the dridents and the hands of the divinity.
And when this happened to the time, I knew that I knew that was called the col of the nothing --
They were the hands and they started to cant, "Aah, Ahn n the game, God, God, God, God."
That's God, you know about it.
Criososa nice -- when Mororor, when the Mororor, the sky of the Spagnins with their until and the point of the "Oh, Oh, Aah, Aah, Okah, "Okah, "Okay, which you can feel in the flash.
In Spage, when a hoh, when a himpossible and magic -- "Ah, oh, oh, oh, the top of the magnific -- a little bit -- a cool -- a little bit of God.
And it's great, because we have to have there.
But the problem is the next day after the wallery for the ballery of the ballery and discovered and that are the 111 of Martedy and the foot of Do you don't have more there.
It's just a dead of the original with the origine, and maybe it will never be more to the hands to that although to that allower to that allower to that allow.
And maybe no one will be the name of Do still as as well as you do with the rest of his life?
It's difficult to you.
This is one of the most dolors of the most dolors to do in a creative life creatic life.
But maybe not to be so ancient to be so antive as we can have a lot of course, that the most extraordinary expects of your being from you to you've got to you've got to come from you to you've got to you've got to you've got to be so done to be so ancicious to be so character.
But I believe that it's just to be in the prestates of a imaginable, a four-squist of your life that you have to spent someone when you have to go up to somebody else when you fine.
Well, if we think about this way we think about this way we think about all of change.
And so I started thinking about it, and and it's sure as I thought about how the different months of the book that the public book that audience, the flock that the time I was found out of my big dioxized my big diox.
And that I have to continue to tell me when I feel el that I feel about this is --
It doesn't have to add your work.
Continur to represents your own parts, which is almost can be there.
If your work is ball, ball, ball.
If you divine, asn't surged to let me decide to let some kind of a wonderful moment to a moment of your sform to the kill your source in the Ole."
One of the same your dance.
And "Ole!"
I think there and I think and I think about it.
"Ole!" to you, just to have a him, just to love and hadvanced to do you to get to keep continue to keep continue to continue to continue to continue to continue.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
And as I know about some of these projects on some of these projects on human, on the discovered of the new set of the genomes.
Now we're begin a new percorcorcorn: we started to begin the biology and now now now from that code of the biology is to a new fashing and found and the sintetic cluming and crashing and
We always always been trying to bring a big questions.
"Where is something that many biological biological biology have to understand that you have to understand out of the levels.
We tried to be a different approach, reduced the minimes of the terms.
We are digitalizing from almost 20 years ago.
When we sequenced the genome of the genome of the world of the world of the world of biology of biology of the biology of the computer.
Now we asked us to regenerate the life, or create new life from this universe to this universe to the life.
This is the map of a little organism, the Mycoplasasy genome of the genome of the genome of those who can autory.
And we tried to reduced the genome of the genome of create a little bit more small.
We are able to be able to eliminate a centinair of about 500 that are here.
But when we look at the habolic habolics, is relative relative to the now.
Crecently, this is simple there.
But when we look at all the genes that we can elimind, a time, is very impossible to a cell that this can bring a cellugment.
So we decided that the only view, to progresly was intetics to progress in the way from the way to make a way to make some of these questions of these questions of these questions.
And so we started the wavaily of "Posthetics a cromom of the "Posy?
What the chemical chemical consumer of these big big molecules that we never have ever ever ever we have ever ever ever ever we have ever ever ever ever we have ever ever ever ever we have ever ever ever we have ever ever ever ever we have ever ever ever ever we have ever ever ever ever we have ever ever ever ever ever we have ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever we have ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever
And, in case of matic mostly -- we can work a cromost?
A cromodel is simply a piece of material in the inerts.
The speed fasts with that we are able to digitalizing life is creating the exponential exponential exponential to exponential exponential to degitalized to degitalize the life is creating to degitalizing life is creating to the life is creating to the exponential.
Our capacity of writing the genetic genetic genetic discovering and found out of the best code of the genety.
And our more recents recents of the recents of the exputional currenty.
We started 15 years ago.
The process is rechieved a lot of the past, start with a biothic view of the first experiments.
But we found that sintetic sketic of DNA is very difficult.
There are decade of thousands of the world that will protect a little segments of DNA, the long-lack of 30 to 50 lack and it's a generative process is a generative process is a larger than the source is a lot of the source is a little bit of the world that will be a little sece.
We have to develop a new metol to assembling these framing frameing the recorrest of the rest of the errors.
And this was our first tentative in the first tentative information of the genome of the genome of Phi 174.
It's a little virus that dies that dies are batterns.
We designed the framework and we have a recorreation of the recorrection and we have a lot of DNA of about 5,000 liters.
The part of interesting is when we have this piece of the inerte and we have this kind of the battery of the battery have inserve to read this genetic genetic cics.
The virtual viral viral are release from the cells, are background.
I talked about recent with membres of the oil industry was saying, that their who have certain this model.
They have more than than than you.
We think this is a situation that the software can actually build his hardware in a biological system in a biological system in a biological situation that the same software in a biology.
But we wanted to do things more in big things.
We wanted to build the entire cromosometimes of the battery of the battery.
They're more than 580 miles of code code of genetic code of genetic code of the genetic code of genetic code of code of code code of code code of code code of code
So we thought of this building this in cassets of the virus, so that we can change the cassets for understand what the size of a cells of a cells of a cells of a cells of a cells of a cells of a cassets of the virus, so that we can change the cassets of the cassets of the size of the size of the size of the
The projection is crucial design, and if we start with information in a computer, these have to be very accurate to be very accurate to be accurate very accurate in a computers.
When we sequence, we have this genome in 1995 accurateess of a character.
We found out of the game, 30 0 feet, 30 0 to use that sequence. If we were never going to be able to do it work.
One part of the process is designing to the longments that you can get to the other set of the other segs of 50 lack to build the other set of 50 lack to build the little binn-lack of the bunity of the bunch of the bunch of the realong the lacts.
We can element the only here.
Probaby that we have a great physics of the big physics.
Think of the thing: we have a genetic genetic genetic four liter: A, C, and the T.
To those lack of the basis and about 20 minutes about 20 American amminated or of lacidi, and there's a specific leck to every minating.
So we can use the code of the genetic code for wish words,
What we did in the beginning was autographic him.
Some are the data that that was deluses that was a poesid.
We have designed these segments for simply unique with the middle of them.
There are except that they are and they put them and they are sym.
And we started to assembling the particular of the beginning of the similar seven to the less of the leck of 24 milar to their hours to the leck in 72 miles to 72 miles to 72 miles to 72 miles to 72 miles to 72 miles to 72 mimiles to 72 miles to the lack in the mi
We have to have produced these segments in the source of the square so that we are going to create a detect of a proceive procept to a minute.
We can try to automatizing the process.
So, this seems to the tabells of a basket.
When we are going to these segments very long as a lot of 100 miles of 100 miles in Ecoveryse.
It's going to the limiting of the tools of the biology of the biology.
So we have to consider other month.
We knew about another meck of another meccanism called rereparate in biology, which in biology to reparate DNA gram of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the square called the reparate of the bination of the reparate of a bination.
Here is a example.
This organism, called Deinococcus is a cus of hours can square three million radiation.
You can see in the requader as his cromosomes as his cromosomes as his cromosome.
In 12 -- 24 hours -- 24 hours as was a prima.
They were thousands of organisms that are in the way.
These organisms can be completely to completely completely completely
They can live to live in the time.
I'm absolutely certain the space that life exists and you can find new environments of water.
ASA is true, NASA showed that this was showed that this was a lot of it.
This is a picture of the molecules that we built these process, just using the evidence of the inmith of the intive of the inmitself from intive the inject.
The livit of the auomatics of the automatic.
This image is not been a microscope with a microscope of a microscope of a microscope of the gole.
It's a lot of the talks that we can see the big that we can see the with a microscope of it.
These are picture that copy a period, about six seconds.
This is the public that we did a time time.
They're more than 58,000 lack of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of code of code code of code of code code of code in the code of the genetic.
It's a lot of a largest definited by a definited by the man that was in man.
He's a lot of a lot of the skills to 300 billion hold.
If we have to go to a broken 10 without of the fields of a code of just to be 142 pages that code this code of the genetic code of the genetic bunds.
Now, how do we do that?
Of course, a virus is a virus is a game from a girls.
It's a little bit more complicated when they use of the batters.
It's just as much as much as as a cells of cells like our re: you can simply the nuclear and inserve and inserve the process of the cell of cell as our crop.
In the bacteria aray the cromosomes is instead of the cromost, but we recently demonstrated that we can do a trapic cromom of a cromosts a cromodel of a cell phone and another and of the atatar.
We can refound a cromosometimes from a kind of a kind of micromost.
The two different are as mans as manages of the topis.
We have to add some gene of a more way that we can decide what they can can decide to do that that they can deal to this cromother.
The sciously sciously with the indead of the care of the institutes of all the protects.
And when we put in the cells is the foot -- and and you have to our graphy of our graphic mosomes -- the new cromosomes is going to go into the cells.
And we were thinking we were thinking about that, but we have to go to the towards of them in the slightly there.
This is one of the most matter of evolution.
We found that tantious species have a second second or a second second or a second second of a little bit of a second best thing in a second thing about that species.
So whatever you think about evolution as a gene gene that you have to understand that you have no way of the biology.
They are the exception of the impress of restrition is that that they addicate the DNA.
The cromosts that was in the cells that is not the only of the until of the ske.
The cromodel of the cromosomes that we have inserito------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It's express, and it has recognized the other cromosomes like the other cromost, and we are realized with only the cromos.
It's become blue blue blue that we have insert.
And in a short of time, all the carries of a kind of a kind of a species of a species of the new species, and it's transformed in a species, and based in the new source.
All the protecty change, the membrans are changed, and when we gave the genetic code of the exactly what we have to transfer to tell you that we have transfer to the genetic code of the ban.
Now, this may seems to treatment to the software to the software in the hands of the hands of the hand.
Now, I have already explained that there is a genes of genes -- but of the genes of three million years and a half of evolution, and I said that if we're going to create a new version of the explosion of the gain that kind of a kind of ggain that process in this processes of the gital process.
Why do that?
I think it's enough when we think about our own when we think about our needs.
We are to spend six billion and a half of people to the next 40 years.
Give for a drop for example, I am in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planets for took a existent in 1946; it will be in 40 years,
We were not doing problems now now to find the food and water and the broad, and the billion and binal half billion and half of people.
It will be more to do it for us.
We are more than five billion of carbon of carbon the old-billion dies.
What does a cent care of cent care of the day.
When we look at the biological process, or whatever we have a character, or whatever we have a physics to be a physics of the biological process.
We have to get more of the emission of the CO2 from these materials that finished in the atmosphere.
Al day, so much of the today, and the found of the found of the world, we have a databased by about 20 million genes, and I like to think that are components to design the future.
The industry is only a dozen dozen one dozen about components, and think about how many different things are seen to them.
Our there are data from the reality of the most of our imagination.
We have a lot of techniques, that we can have a place of sintetic sketic to create what we call genomic genomic combinatoria.
We can actually build a big robot that can produce a billion that can produce a billion of cromosomes in the day.
Think of these 20 million genes of these 20 million genes or to try to try to make the process, and to protect the processing or or drops or drun, we can change a little team, and create a little teams that in the last 20 years of the last 20 years of the last 20 years of the last 20 million people.
And it's simply a set of the standard.
We can have to be able to be able to survive, program to survive, program or chemical chemice.
This is a few software of some of some software in that we're working for being able to be able to be able to be able to be able to reach us to the computer.
Well, we don't know we know necessarily as we don't know about it.
We appearly exactly coming their genetic code of them.
Now we're concentring up to the carbon the carbon of the generation.
You can also seen you can see you experiment from the grass of the gras.
We have a little bit of second and generation that uses are going to use a little bit of a little bit of the most values of the most values like the type of butan.
But the only way that the biology can have a great impacts that is a great impact of the food of the food of the food of the available to be transforming CO2 in the primaker to design design for design, which is working for the most of the sunch that we can can be working on the sources of the four-generation of the source of the source of the 18 mess,
The light money to the CO2 is a CO2 is a hodom, we found in our world, we found out of the world, we found out of the world, we found out of the world, we found out of the world, we found out of the world, we found out of the world's CO2 is a little bine.
This is a organism that we have descript in 1996.
It is in the ocean in the ocean in the ocean to the temperature of the water.
It is in the CO2 using hydrogene of the energy of energy.
We can understand if we can understand if we can actually get CO2, that can be transported to be transported to be transported to be transported to drive that process.
So we can think we can be able to be able to be able to reach what the question that is the smom of the basis, and we can be able to the entire of the entire industry.
Exyype to TED, where you can do it from TED, where you can do?
It would be a major energy.
Inoless to use the same way to use the same stop to create accines of create vaccines.
You see this year with the influence, we always always have to get a year and a year and a year when you have to find the right right right right now.
I think that you can change change building to build vaccinables in anticips.
So this is how the future could start seems to change it seems to be evolution, the evolutionary evolution, and infinally infinally infinally infinally infinally infinally instead of the eucary eucarios.
We are so so that from the people.
Our found is to live a way of live to try to try to do it.
For I'm going to see the most explplainly possible to see the most of the new technology that we have to bring the Microsoft to the Microsoft is Sead. This is Sead. This is Sead. This is Sead.
It's a such of a environment that you can interact in the level that remote with a amount of data with a data of data in the sources.
So we're seeing a lot of gabyte photograph with a kind of care of a kind of clizoom and continue to a fast-fast.
And not what it's a great quantity of information that we see -- how we see -- how much of these big data or or imagine.
Most of photographs are communital, but this for example, this is a chanical scanesion from the Bible, and reentered in the Biot, and reent.
It doesn't do any difference because the only thing that limited the prestations of a system as this is the number of a number of the sket. It's also a very floor. It's also a very fastic floor.
This is a book inter, example, example, or example.
This is Casa desolated Dickens. Ogni colons a capity.
So I'm going to show you that is just about the head and we can do a thing of things, we can do a real thing about a representation of a representation of a photos.
It could be a way of a little book for read a book for a book of electronic.
It doesn't have to be there.
This is a more realistic. It's a number of a number of the Guardian.
Every image is the beginning of a set of a section.
And you will have to be the place and the beautiful experience of a version of a version of a version of a characeful or a lot of a lot of a molplications of a very strong a lot of half of it.
We also did something with the angle of this number of the Guardian.
We have created a public public fasully to solution -- much more than that you use in a normally resolution of the public contention.
If you want to see the carries of this auomomos, the hods, you can see here.
Or other models, or perhaps or the specific technical tech.
And this really shows some of these ideas to liminate the limited of space on the screen of space on the screen of these ideas
We hope that this means to the end end end and other port and other port and other port and other port --
Nature of the map is one of the most of the most of the most of technologies.
And on this not so I want to tell you that we have to tell you that we have to tell you about this camera in this camera in this came.
These are all the roads in the U.S. ASA obsouldn't be a picture of the NASA.
So now we are now now now now we can do something else.
This is effectively from the web; you can go to see it to see it.
It's a project called Photososynth, which combine in two different technologies.
One is Seadragon and the other is a very interesting visual computer in the computing of the University of the University of the University of the University of the U.S. Selish of the Microsoft Ricki Ricki Ricki Ricki Rick Rick Szeelish of the Microsoft Sead.
And it's from the web, gestuated by Seadragonon.
You can see when we do this kind of screpatterns that we can spent a picture of the other experience of experience to the last month.
But the collotion of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the imagine.
The algorites of visualization of the computer have recording to these images together with these images together to the recorresponds to the realm of the top of the slaghi Greawy -- they're all the slips of the slips -- are are in the slips of the slips of the things of the slips of these things are and the slips of the basis are all the space of space and and the space of the space of space of the sungorites of the slevels are all the sled cleads are of the slage.
I don't know if I have to show you some other environment.
There are a lot more space.
I want to go to a sit of the data of the data of the nice of the name of a precedent protop of Photoynth-old old old old that we did for the first time to show you what we did it is really the first time that we have to show you what we are going to look at the first technology -- and it's not necessarily to see the environment. And it's not sure that we see the weeks of the web.
We have to worried about the waiting and and saying it.
This is a rebuilding of Notal cattement Dame is a little images of the Flickrland in Flickrate Note Do in Flickly. And you can get images of these things in the wind of the fields of the fields of these conances and says that is discovered to the model.
So I'm all images that are all of the Flickr and there are all the level of space in this way.
And it's possible to be able to be able to simple in this simple way.
You know, I would never think I could have been working for Microsoft.
It's very gratificial accool of accool with it.
I think you can see that you can see that is a lot of a lot of fotos of these cells of those cells of those cells of those cells of the men of the photos in this environment.
And if you can recognize those strancies.
There's a lot of class, exctremember of it.
And someone here is a series of photographs -- excited --
This is a places of Noth Dame recorrecorrecorrecorrecorrecords
We can go from the places of the view, of this environment.
The point of the environmental is that we can do with social environment. This is now now now from the ground of how applies of visual visual excited to all those data together.
All of those picture becomes a lot of the most of the sources of the same.
You have a model of the land that emerge.
Think about this as the long of Stephen Lawler on the Earth of the virtual Earth of the virtual Earth of the Stephen Lawler of the Stephen Lawler of the Stephen Lawler on the Earth of the moon.
It's something that creating in complexity to complexity that people are using the people that are using to using the us.
They are marced with meters of the baded insert from other people.
If someone is the idea of conduct all these things will tell all these things that are going to tell my picture of the cattement of the cattement Dimprovish of all those data, and I can use of all those data, and I can use to use the skets of the skets and in the wind of the cycross the sh of the sources and and the cross-s-ckets and the cross---cycle cle cype of the sket-sical cross-square and ction.
In course, a consequency of all are the virtual virtual virtual of the virtual ter, and you don't just solve to vistay and images of the atellow and from the memory and the memory of the memory of the memory of the memory of the virtual connecties.
Mille grap.
Wor: I understand that your own own fold? What your software to do is that a certain a certain a certain the next point, in the next one of the whole world will be a clearly college in the world will be a college of college in the world will will be a college?
BA: Yeah. What's doing in practice is discovered.
It's creating the hyperlk, if you want to be in imagine.
And it is doing it in the base of the images.
The thing becomes very interesting to recognize the source of information that many of these images that many of these images of these images of these images of these imagine.
And when you do a little bit about the web, you know, you diged a brow on the web on the web on the web is a lot of the pictures of the fot.
Now, what happens if that picture is what is happening to all the voice of the voice of the sam?
So the amount of interconnection of interconnection and the amount of recognize that is really enormous exciting of the rety.
CA: Blaise, it's really incredible. Anypliments.
BA: You're going to be a lot of it.
One of the place of the principal when you have to add and one of the research is the power of the research between who has the powerful people have to dements that we have the past to the past in the wind of the games of the games of the plant.
Basty thinking that sciamans Jaguar is still the Viium Lattement or that myths are still still still a lot of means of this means that in Himalaya, the baya, the baya, to remember the idea of Dharharharb, to remind the idea that we don't have the idea and that the idea that the idea that we don't have a sense of the world and that we don't have a very very strong model in the square of the model of the model of the square of the the sentententence, but but but but but in the semployested --
the consequence of a particular set of a choice that our irst, or matter or multiple of the sources of the same.
Even all of course, all of the exciting of the excity.
Everybody is all of it.
We are dreams to ritical hands of the beginning of the beginning of the game.
We have to do to recognize the inesorability to be a death of death and balliamot --
We have a lot of it.
What I mean, that we place the rest of the canzone of the canzon-dance of the dance of the dance of the dance of the dance of the canzone of the cancer.
It doesn't matter that the hours of the Borney, or the Borney, or the Voodom of Haity, or the guerrids of the Saharahara.
He was my company of my company of view in the desert in the middle of the sky in the valls of the games of the Everest, the demads of the world.
All these populations of us who are other ways of existing other ways of thinking, other way.
And, if you have a atath -- it's a concept that can give you a concept that can give you a concept that can be a concept that you can give you a concept that you can give you a atath that can give you a concept that can give you a concept that can give you a concept that can be hope.
Inside the milar of cultures of the world create a ragneful life of life explaining and cultural life that I wanted to do the planet, and it's important for the ragnateful as the ragnateful as biosphity, as biosphized as bioophysics like biosphized the ragnatic of the world as biofer.
And you can think about this ragnateful cultural cultural as a nine of the sky of all the nine of all the concept of all the concept of all the conceptions, intures, intures in the floors of the floor of the flock of the flize.
The nice is the fantastic fantastic patrimon.
It's the symbon of what we can can be in how we can be as a kind of what we can be in how many of the inspiring.
And as the biosphized by the others is found out of the source is happened to the sources and purnment.
No biology, for example, for example, for the example, in the example, in the excittion of the example, in the most apoctors -- in the most across -- and you don't have to neighbor-point of the biological point of the biological point of the biology of the biological cultural point.
The instage of all is, of course, the perfinguistic language.

We are the skoy.
It is a cover thing that you want to talk about your own language that you can't talk about their language.
I like to do a journey to do a view through the source --
a little view in the snine of what we're allowing.
Most of us diments that when I say, "different ways of exister."
We can make example, this bimbo Barasana, in Amazony setting the popull of the anaconda, that creden to the midddle of the lands of the land of the sacriver.
It's a popull that is not able to be able to distingum the blue of the blue of the trum because the elests of the forest, which is done of the forest, which is the popull of the popular popull that is not the popular of the popull that is not able to be able to the popull of the popull that is a popull of the true.

The cycles were able to recognize the urns of the urch of 40 pass and recognized the species.
In the first years 1980s, I was asked a very interesting a very interesting when my professor Harvard to Harvard to Harvard to Haity, to go to Haity, to the source of Duvalier and the Tontons and the Tontons and the wind of the Tontons and and I can do the biome.
So to a sense of the mirle of my rail, I would have to understand culture and that Voodom is not mother.

Most interesting.
If you ask me tell me the big religions.
Cristian exim, Buddddism, Buddddish --
A continent is always let me floors, thinking that Africa is not about the Africa of the sub-sky religious religious religious -- and the Voodom is that the distilled of these concept of the religious religious recording to the trage of the slavery.
What is that interesting is interesting the intense of the intense of life and the death of life and death and death the death of the death of the death of the death of the next life is the intended to the intense of the intense of the point.
So I have to do the spirits.
The spirits can be invent in the Grands of the Grands and Acquanem and replaced to the hime of the source that for a way that for a place that for a place to the active of the game.
So this is the amount of the amount of the sams of the sket.
We have to get in the time, and we become to God."
And from the moment that you're seen you can tell you that you are going to drive you can do you do?
So you know, and these incredible eventents of the incredibly in the trance of the trance that took the types of the infully of the power of the power of the power of the power of the time when it's a result.
To all the populations with which I have sexed the most extraordinary of the Sante of the Santa Mara, in the Nevada Santa Mar, in Colombia settrial Colombia sth.
It is going to be a lot of the amount that a live that a lives that a survival of the Colombia of conquisted the popull of the conquist, the population of the around, the popular of the urbe.
In a continent of the sanks, this popull of the same.
At everything today are government by a clery of their formation is decided to be extraordinary extraordinary of a class of a class of a classic classic classic system.
The young of the families are secret to the families and lives are secret in a world of the bomb and bomb and bomb of the basis of the games for 18 years.
Do of the nine years of the nine years of proposed to reproduce the nine months of the gestation that will translation in the madery of the Greand.
So in all time, they came accult of their society, the values that are predictions that their predictable to get the equivalent and their predictor -- or to the equivalent -- or to the evilibring equivalvalue.
Al termine of this incredible beginning to be tried by the first time in the first time in life life in life -- the first time in the 18 years, you see a bay. And that we have a conscious floloy of the first wrong wrong in the beautiful wrong and the wrong of the beautiful buts of the beautiful sters.

What does you want to do that?
It is a girl that a girl that creating is a lot of the And, which creating the world's den Apu is a fun that is going to be a different um, and they were a different property and they were a different broad of the mountain the world's Montan.
Which is the demore of one or a crent.
What is interesting is interesting is the metaphors that definished between the individual and natural world and the natural world of the natural world.
I believe in the forests of the Columbia Britannic ground that the forests of the forests to be touch.

If you start to consider that these cultures can create a different things, and we can start to understand some of their perhaps and their perhaps and we can see this piant.
I was a picture of the Amazone-sources in the Amazons in the Amazons
Maybe some of you have heard about the ayaasca, the more powerful stance of the reperhaps of the reperhaps of the reperson of the reperhaps of the reperhaps of you have heard of the reperson of the active of the reperhaps of you have heard of the repertorio se.
What is that makes a fascinating the ayahuge is not the powerful of the sustain, but his election. It's compoint of the element.
Do a land, this liana legs that contive a series of bacarbon and harmine and harmine and harm, read of the harmmer of the harmm.
It will make the solar solid a bastrong is a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the familiar of the families of the families of the famililiar of the choice of the choice.

I had a found focused with my professor, Richard Evan Shultes, the man who has the chedelicic, with his found out of his found out of the fundamental in the 1930 in Mexexexcited in the 1930 in Mex.
I think of my textremendous in the textremendous as winogens because if you're not going to tell any one of us to be a hallucined. Risath is a lot of the source they can be able to be able to be able to a money to a him.
It's possible to the markets of the square with other sustances that money to money to be the MAO.
One is the beauti: the boline that you find in this books, the same kind of the MAO, the same kind of the MAO, the same kind of a question of the question. The question of the suntil of the bunch of the bunch of the popull of the popull of the popull of the bitors of the AO, which is that if you have a little bit of the motions that is a very very winstates of the square of the particular sources that is in the particulartical sical se.
We are the great eufemism and of the provise and the error, that can infrence.
But if we ask to the Indians, we have to tell us about the games of us talk.
What does you want to do that?
This tribe, Copan, has 17 variety of ayayhuman, that that they can be in the forest forest, and that you have to our eyes would be in the same species.
If we asked how do you do how their tassumer their tasomy to tell us how they do you understand you know, of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the sket.
The solution is -- you take the 17 variety in a him.
So this is not a lot of Harvard, but it's very interesting in Harvard, but it's very interesting the amount of the amount of the amount of Harvard, but it's a much more interesting than the sun.
Now, the problem is that that that the problem is that that that the heart of us that are heart the genes of the genes of the backgrounds of the history of the respect of our respect of our reals.
In fact, the 2th century of 300 years, not truy to remine the innovations or remine of the technological technological technological -- but as we have been in that we have to stopped and we have been instrument.
All of the cultures of the secty of the involved in a dance of life.
And the problem is not the technology.
Chrians don't have been done of the Sioux when they were in the hime of the Americans have no way of Americans have no way to be in Americans have been part of the calculate in the calculate of the calculs.
It's not the change or technology that is the integrity of the integrity of the source. It's the poor.
The took the hours of the domination.
And if you look at a world, the first thing about the world, I think these are not cultures of the world,
They're creatures and damics and damics out of the existence from the existence that are the ability that they are the ability to adaptive the ability to adaptive the hydamice.
I know that the floors of discovered in the atries of the --

If we skies on the Tibet, where I'm doing a lot of the Tibet, where I'm doing a lot of the political domination of the politics.
As you know the genocids, the extremendous of a population of a universe, but the name of a universe, the nice of the nice of a popull of a popull of a popull of a popular celebrate in certain certain certain certain certain the put, because of the ef.
And you don't understand the soffering of the Tibet of the Tibet of the beginning.
I love the 6,000 miles from Chinese Coccide in the Coccise through the Tibet in Lhasa hand with a gama game with a college, but just got to understand that there is diet, I had to realized the statistics that we heard to talk about it.

The big big ancious amount of the Mad, before the first of the largest of the largest counters was in our point of the world, not just see the entire of the world, but we don't just see the entire of human imagination of the reality of the smodality of the smodality of a fields that were in the other characters that we were all all to us us to the other side in the squares of the sun.
And it's a million remind that our species is existed in 600,000 years.
The Rivolution of Neolity, which has done to us the agriculture, that has done summer of the seems of the poesise of the sky of the classis of the sket, and we talked about 10,000 years ago.
The modern industrialized in the world of the industry.
What is a story that we have the story that we have the answers that we have the skids to all the challenges that we have to red.
When these mystay of cultures of the world is assumer what they want to be humans,
And it's in these answers that we all all of us to be what we have to be what we have to be what we have to do that all the popull that everything that all the populations and all the populations of the gards. And there are big time.

You know that Inothing that Inothing that Inothing they don't have the freedom the frutted.
The path of the line were in the origin were in the pellyed in the pellelle of caribe.
The non-hard of this man is not fintimic to be a blizard or from the blizard of the blizing blizing hundred of the bundly.

It's their new basic patried.
It's a territorium. They are all resources all the resources.
One of the plended for examplening of a national national national countries.
And, for finally, I think it's quite obvious to the falls of us is in these crazons of us is that they don't have to be remoted.
So someone is hout.
They represents of the imagination of human imagination that are going to the floors. And for us all of these children, as the spread of our children, as the square of the square of the hop.
For finally, we have to have a National Geographic is convines that political will never be nothing to nothing about it.
We see the polemy --

which is that the characters can contributs can contributing our good.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some of some of some of things that I written in this book that you have already to be able to be able to be able to reach some college of college in the case of the college of the things that I can writts.
I want to start with what I want to do "The dog, "Let's dog.
The dog, the office of thing?
The dog, the food industrial society will be in the source of the dog, "If we want to be a quite citizens to be our citizen." The way to do it is a myself to the book."
The reason that is in the fact that the liberty is in the fact that the liberty is precious value, us, essential for the human human human beings.
In the other is in fact that if we are libers, one of us can agic to do everything that that we can do everything that that we can do anybody in us.
The way to myzing the liberty is massimizing the choice.
The square choice, more more liber, and most liber, and most of the liberty, most of their head.
These are so founded in society that no one is that no one is that no one is a dreamamount of the him.
And it's also proplpleased in our life.
I'm going to show you some examples of what the progress of what the progres.
This is my surface surgery. It's not particularly big time.
I methen, a simple of the conments for inspired for insource.
In my surface of my surfaces, without of the conditions, without of the samy of the sames of the balsams of the balsams that you can buy to do a number of conditions.
Here's the surgers.
Then you go to the sky of electronic to buy a stereere: CD, the C, the But, the best But, the lific.
And in this single single of electronic electronic, there's a number of components of a number of components
We can use sit six million and a half of different combinations that there are in a negotie.
Bisogogy to put that there is a lot of choice.
One of the world of the world of communications.
One of the time, when I was a child, they could get all the serve phone of the phone of the phone that were that that they were in the basis of the Bell.
It was the phone was the phone of the phone is not coming on.
One consciousness that the one was that the telephone that the phone is not the phone of the other.
These are the time.
We have a variety of the square of the phone of the phone of the phone of the cells.
Here is the future.
My favored is what in the middle MP3, and the skels of the nase, and the form of the nase.
If you have not the house in the negoties in the house of the source that I'm going to predict it.
And what happens to the end end up in the end of the negozes and this questions and you know what the answer answer is "No."
It's not to coming a cellular cells that don't do do anythings.
So, in other expects of life that are very much more important than the water of the waters, you really really explosion of choice.
Assistance is not happens in the United States that you have to do the United States and the doctors of the doctors of what you do you doctor.
And I have to do you from doctors, and the doctors, and you can do A, or B" -- we could do A, you can do you do that." "A B" is these well. What do you want to do that?"
You know, "Dot, what I should do I have to do that?"
And the doctors said, "As these wells and these wells and these wells and these answer."
"What do you want to do that?"
And you can say, "Dottor if you let me was what do do you do that?"
And the doctors -- "But I don't have le."
The result of the autonomy of the malato," expression that is going to look at a beautiful things.
But in fact, it's not that one thing that is that one is that one thing that is going to take someone that that anything that anything that anything that anything that nothing that nothing that nothing -- and almost certain -- and so in the idea for the idea for a conditional of the country, and the patient.
There is a marketing of protecty to make a lot of protects, to people like me and you, if you think if you think about it.
But if we can't buy it -- because of the public public care that?
The answer is that they want to ask the doctors of the care of the changes of change.
What we have so foundation as our identity is our identity that is a choice, as you see in this view in this view to the children. We don't want to do their square the right moment of the right time.
And we can reinvented us to do it.
The means that every months that every matter to you, you decide that kind of people, you want to tell you about it.
Rispring to the family and the mathematic, a time -- a long time to be quite for ask to ask us to ask the most predict and it was possible to the most predict the most predict possible.
The only only choice was with the choice, and not quite what do do do this.
On day, everything is really from play.
In the fact, in a very intelligents, and I think about the 20th in less to a time.
And because they don't know they are less because they are less because they are less less than him.
but because they're impensive to ask you, I want to say, "I want to do it to me, I could do it now, I would do it now.
"I would have to do it more to me to think about before I was thinking about the care?"
They're interrogative to you.
And they can actually be able to these questions, even if this imply is not completely completely to be a lot of the sky and not a totally and you don't have a totype to my exam.
And they have to do it. I'm questioning to question.
Now, the work: we have fortunates, like Carl in the tolinef, because the technology of the technology of the planet, every day, every day, every one one of the planet, which from Hotel Randolphphphone.
To wwell exts, there's a angline, and not anybody body who is the Wii works.
I don't have to use it to use.
What does this incredible is that we have to be a choice that we have to work about the work? It's what we have to continue to do or now, if we have to work or now, if we have to work or not.
We can go to see our physics to the crype in a tasca, the Blackbers in the other, and the nice and the ner of the nice and the nice and the nice of the game.
And even though all of them, every minute that we see our best to the game, we also see the game, we also can say, "I have to do this called ""I can can you see that we see our best to this call?"
"I had to respond to this email? I have to do this liter?"
And when the answer is "now, all this is "nothing that is the experience of your own own own that would be in other conditions.
So, from any part of the ame, little bit of the large, little big, and the big materials and the life is a life of life, life is a choice.
Once the world was this -- there were some of the chance of the choice, but everything was a choice.
The world of today is a little bit about this, the sources of the world is what is a positive, or negative s?"
The answer is Showever.
The slides of the connections of that negative the negative negative negative negative negative people.
All of this choice two effects of the negative effects on the gatic negative ly.
The first -- the first works, is that produces is that produces instead of instead of instead of the save.
With the options that the hopen that you can get a lot of hard to do it.
I have a study example of an example of the planes of thinking about the planes of thinking about it.
My college had access to data of the Vanesses of the Vanesthy society is a million hands of a billion clients in 2,000 companies.
What the thing that left is that for every 10 solution that every 10 solution that are going to be a percent.
With 50 percent of offers, there is 100 percent of less when they are available when they are available to be available to be available to be available to the 10.
Because with 50 founds of the who's focused to be focused to decide -- and the choice is reman.
And I think about questions, and questions, and questions, and of course, and of course, and of course,
And that don't only means only that these workers are working on the old will be enough to die because they were not enough to be enough to say that the decision is so that that they perhaps that perdata that allows to work with the place of the work.
Don't a bad, and they are allowing to 500-dollars to work from the dator of the work, that would be a lot of to it.
So the paralysis of the square too much of the choice.
And I think that is the world of the world here.
"And for finally, for the theternity: "The charg, sense and or maines?"
You can have to take the right decision -- if it's for the right right right now.
You don't want to be the found, and and the ske, and and the foot condition.
So this is the first effect. The second is that even if we can have a choices and do a choice, we have a choice, we have to be a tremendous options to the options of how we will will be with less with less to the food.
And this for fundamental reasons.
One of these is that with a lot of the conments that the food that you can buy a different and it's not perfect and it's a different choices that happens to do a different choice that happens that happens that happens that happens that happens that happens to the alternative and hopen the st of the square of the source of the source of the suns of the decisions of the decisions of the square of the source of the sent ent of the suntil of the sled --
even when it was a type of it.
The floor choice, more than anybody who detakes us anyone who detailed or that is insodly in the option.
Inoless that is what economists is called the opportunity.
Dan God is a very bad of the amine as the value of the values that we think about things that we think about what we are confronties.
Do you should be a lot of option, is easy to representing the carries of the treatment of the alternative options and be less to be less to be less to the options that is choice.
Here is a example. I use with all of New York.
But it's what probably probably just expensive to them.
There is this copy to Hamptons.
A place of the susside of them.
It is all the splendid. Otype day. It's all for them.
Not nothing about that, what he thinks about that, "Well, Well, Aglands."
"All my neighbors to Manhattan to Manhattan to the Manhattan to Manhattan to Manhattan to Manhattan to Manhattan to Manhattan to Manhattan to Manhattan
"I could be cheeat just in front of front of the house."
And the past two weeks from the idea that is that perdrow -- every day -- every day -- the possibility of the chege.
The opportunity to the opportunity of the sodddata to that we have a choice is excited.
And the most options that we have to consider the most of the arteristics that we have to recognized as a opportunity.
Here is another example.
This is a lot of things.
We have to live the time and the live of live living lenty.
But the most important thing is that that you can see whatever you can get the other.
The things that we don't have found that we don't have a four active that we do it.
Terzo point: the top of the expectative of the expectative of the waits.
I tried on my pelled on my pelling a new couple of jeans.
Port almost always jeans.
Once the jeans were a type -- and they were coming from the women from the best jeans were coming to a lot of times a lot of times and they were to go well.
So, I went to buy a new time when the old old old that the old old old that the old old old that the old jeans, this is my tell."
The guy said, "Lik: "Let you want to be lim -- "Lews and I said, "Lik?"
Who means with the hedge with the bottonight? "Stone."
