The last year, I showed these slide to show that the climbing glacial glacial glacial sizes of 48 million years had the sizes of 40 million years has been restretched by 40 percent of the United States of the 40 percent.
But this is the gravity of the problem because it doesn't show it of, it doesn't show the ice of ice or ice the ice of ice or ice the ice of ice --
The artyal climb is, in a sense, the climate heart of the climate system climate system climate system.
You expand it back in the wversummmer and walks.
The next slide will be a quick slide on the last 25 years.
The games are signed in red red it.
You see it expanding until the blue scream.
That's the ice in the winter winter in the winter wildlife of summes.
You can see that the ice called glacior glacior of five years or the further is like the blood of the body.
In 25 years it's spent over like this.
This is a problem because the interesting warming the artor of the artypical artic terrain where there are huge quantities of carbon dibon-congelated meat, they get into the microbies.
Rispaces the totality of the atmospheric warming, that amount of global warming, super-scale amount of the weight of the until we we.

Video: Wow! Al Gore: She's good. The question is if we are going to be even not.
A reason this is that this exchange in the Greenland is warming the Greenland from the northern Greenland from the norther.
This is a fium in the glacial regims.
The brought it never reached levels like similar level.
This is the Kangererlussuaw-up, in the south of the Greenland
If you want to know how the skalail level of the level, you know, the gather, here is where the sea of the sea
These corrups are increasing rapidly.
At the other side of the planet: Antarctic, the largest block of the planet.
The last month last month of the scientists have declared that the balance of the ice is in the negative and that the Antarctures in the sland in the slands of the island is particularly rapid in the shot shot of the shot of the glacium.
Equiven to six feet level, like Greenlands.
Himalaya, the third biggest block of ice block of ice block in the middle of the glacium --
40 percent of the world's population was going to get half the poctable of the shot pollage.
On Ande: this glacier is the source of the water of this city.
The brought is increased.
But when he diminuish, the same acks in the water potable.
In California the snow on the Sierra Nevada is deminuite demination of 40 percent.
The drive ydried.
The predictions, like you have gone to them.
The scent growing world door in the world at a remarkable increasingly autiful increases.
The environmental disasters are increasing a returning out of the normal, and without precedent.
Four times more numbers in the last 30 years of the last 30 years achievements of 75.
This is a whole thing of insustainable going.
If you look at the context if you can see the consequence.
In the last five years we added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the oceans every day.
Look at the oriental area of the oriental oriental area from America and both the west, and both the parts of the subsians of the continent in the oceans.
The major of the global warming, together to the deforestation, which is 20 percent, is the use of fuel.
The oil is a problem, and the carbon is even worse or the carbon is even worse
The United States are one of the two countries with the most emissions, together in the China.
And they were poned to build a lot of other carbon dioxies.
But we're looking at a way of direction.
These are the annulled in the last few years and some alternative proposites.
All the way, there's a political lotate political in our country.
The carbon industries and oil industries have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote the carbon dibon dibon dibon dioxyside.
The image I remind me of something --
Natal, in the Tennessee, where I live it, there was a 3.8 billion gers.
Maybe you saw it on the news of it.
This is the second largest scories in America.
It's happened around Natal.
The natalize of one of the carbon industry was this one.
Video: Moh: Frosty carbonaio is a like and happy.
It's abundant here in America, and it makes our economy.
Frosty carbonaio is increasingly clear carbononish.
It's about buon the price, and workers keep and work workers keep the stypending.
Al Gore: From here is a lot of the West Virginia.
The biggest society on the mountains is Massey Coal. This is his administrator.
Video: Don Blankhenship: I'm going to be clearly clear. Al Gore, Nancy Peloes, Harry Reid -- they don't know what they're talking about.
Al Gore: So the Alleance for the Clim of Clima has launched two napsing countrys.
This is one of it.
Video: Attor: All right. Let's see the climate changes as a threat at at the time.
So our priority is invest a great amount of money in a public effort to make public and confusing and confusing the truth,
In fact, the carbon is not spore.
We think it is a good profumpyed -- it also has a good profum.
So not preocupately.
Let me do you have to lead us.
Video: Attor: Carbon -- you heard about a lot of it.
So let's take a game structure at a structure at the clear fet.
Straordinarily -- machines are a little noise, but this is the sound of the clean technology.
The carbon is between the main the main causal warming causes of global warming, but the notice technology of the carbon that you see changes everything.
You look at a look at the hodd technology.
Al Gore: And finally, the positive alternative positive is connected to the economic security.
Video: M: The America, is in the crisi; the economy, the national security climate crisis.
The film that colleagues everybody's dependence from the rest of the fuels and the weak carbon and the imported.
Now, there's a new audition to come circumstomer to us.
Repower America: 1000 percent of clean energy in dieck energy,
They have a plan to put America in work, make it safer safer than global warming.
Finally, one solution, one solution, that we have to solve our problems.
Repower America. It bought more.
Al Gore: This is the ultimate one.
Video: He's got to redate energy.
One of the fastest ways to bring up the dependence from the combusticles that kills that kills killing our planet.
And, but the future is here. I just just a new energy network, a new energy.
Sox 2: Noves investment in places for places of work well-retribut.
M: Repower America. It's time to be realist.
Al Gore: A old African proverbio African proverby says, "If you want to go fast, you go to the money.
If you want to go away away, you go away together."
We have to go away, quick.
Thank you very much.
The last year at TED fect at TED fect introduction on LHC.
And I promise to turn to back on how the machine.
So here I got it. And for those who the other time the other time they weren't there was no biggest scientific experimented -- 27 kilometers of circus of circumstance.
His comfortable to reach the conditions that were present less than a billion until the beginning of the universe -- until 600 million times a second.
All of this is just the environment.
This is the under Gineva.
We picture these mini-Big Bang Big in the relievators.
This is what I work. It's called ATLAS -- it's 44 feet and has a 22 feet of feet.
This is a spectacular image of ATLAS in building so you can see the proportions.
The 10 seeptember last year, we have accese, we have accese,
And this picture was taken by ATLAS.
It was causing in the control, festimmenses in control.
It's a picture of the first physics of particles that had done around the LHC, entering in LHC, and spread particles in the LHC, and spread particles inside the reevator.
In other words, when we see that image 10 settember the 10 settember the machines worked on the machines worked out that machine.
I don't know if it was to do it more or this when somebody went on Google and saw that the beginning was this.
That means we have had a cultural impact of the scientific impact on the scientific impact.
About a week later, it was a problem with the machine, had to these files -- these sleeps -- these sleeps -- these sleeping files.
These files are 13,000 printing when the machines works at the power.
Now, technical technicians in you will look at files and say, "It's not true. I'm too under ty."
And they can do it because when they are very cold, they become the cosidies of the superconvictions.
So, at less 271 degree, to a inferior in the space between the stars, these files can bring that corrupting.
In one of the most of the most of the magnets in the LHC, there was a defectly defected.
So the files are surprising and they read and the 13,000 ample printing improvisly met a resistance.
This was the resulted.
Now, this is even more impressive if you think that these magnets are about 20 tons than 20 tons -- and that they were moved about 30 imeters.
They are damage about 50 magnets.
We had to take them to the point, what we did it.
We have reclustine and add it.
They're now now now they're going back to the ground.
Entruth, the end of LHC will be again.
We can accept it, and we expect to get the right data or slump or jug, and keep and keep the wind to discover what the universe.
Now, of course, in a certain four-way accidents return the debate on the value of science and engineering. It's easy to confuture.
I think the fact that it's so difficult to go beyond the limits, I think this is the value of things like LHC.
I want to end with the words of a scientist Inglese, Humphrey Davy, whether I image, in defense of inuseful inuseful experiments of his pupll, his clear clear or the deployees of the human mind of the human mind of the human mind as the degress of the human mind of the mind that our mindsees are completely under to the world."
Thank you.
I want to start asking you to think about here, as children, as a children, played with the kids.
While you can understand them and reach them and do them and reach them, and learn them moving in fact, learning in fact, and you know, and solve problems and solve relationships.
The space reason is it deeply connected to the way we understand a lot of the world around us.
So, as an information informed by usulity of our interaction with physics, together to my consultent and my collaboratory collaboratory and my collaboratory and I started asked myself as we use the computer, instead of the mouse of the mouse of the mouse of the mouse digital hands, we can have a deal with an information with both information with both chot with both of our hands,
and we can do it in our please?
The question was so interesting that we decided we decided we demimit the answer -- building the Siftable.
In a few words -- a Siftable computer is a great discovered computer interactive as a birth.
In a few words -- a Siftable computer is a great discovered computer interactive as a birth.
You can move them with the hand, they can see it "They're going to see their movement and have a screen and have a wireless.
But absolutely I have physics, like mattones, like mattons, you can just move to be simply to be able to realize it.
The Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem of tools to manipulate the digital information.
And as they get more physics, and the physics, and the others of the motion, and as they get more physics, and as they get more physics, and the others of the motion, of the others of the explore and interactions of the interaction.
I'm going to start with some simple example.
This Siftable is configured to show the video -- if you including it in a direction, the video it will including the other side back.
These interactive interactive of others.
If they are in the way they are interested in what they are around it.
If they come circumstic, they can get a little bit.
If they come circumstic, they can get a little bit.
They also have their movement and incline.
And then we realized that one of the interaction was the power to use gestures on the data, to the data as if it was a liquid.
In this case, we have three Siftable configurated like a seck of the color, and I can use them to the color in the middle of the color in the middle of the color in the mix of the color.
and I can use them to use them to the color in the middle of the central same.
If we can get it too much at the time, we can put a little bit at it.
They're also beautiful chance of learning, as the languages, the mathematics and games of logical things to try and see the immediately.
I'm going to be --
This is a Fibonacus that I do with a program of equations.
Here we have a game of words that is half between Scarabeum and Bogggle.
Pratically, at every turn of the house of the house of the Siftable, Pratically, to every turn Siftable, and as a certain composition.
Then, after about 30 seconds remix and you have a new set of letting and new possibility to try to get a new possibility to try to do.
Thank you.
Here's the children came to the Media Lab, I did it so that they tried them and I turned a video.
They are pleased.
And one of the interesting things about this kind of application is that you don't have to give a lot of education of the instructions.
You just have to say, "The Compones of words, and they know what to do.
Here's some people who tried it.
This is our own beta more jump, there on the right.
It actually wanted to be the large piges.
They were just burn in the morning, for him.
Now, this is an application of a interactive cardboard.
We wanted to build a tool of the apprenticement of the languages is Felix.
It can put new characters in the scene, and the scene, and the same.
It can put new characters in the scene, and the scene, and the same.
So it's doing the sun out of the sun
Video: The only is the sun.
David Merrill: She's led a treat in the scene.
Video: The arancient treat.
By work!
So school by using Siftable and put them closing neighbors can interact the characters --
Video: Bau!
and inventing their story.
Video: Cyao!
DM: It's a story with the open-open-up, and it can decide him.
DM: It's a story with the open-open-up, and it can decide him.
Video: Vole,
DM: The last example I have time to show you is a tool, realized recently, to be a recent and to execk and to be music.
it's a recently, in recent recently, to change and exech and music.
The Siftable here are all going on like base and battery.
Each one of these has four different variations, and you can choose what use.
You can put these sound sound in a sequence to your floor of your floor.
And it just just by doing it just touching a "sound sound and a "sequence."
These are effects that you can control from living, like the filterm and filter.
And the attacks to a particular particular and then including it.
And then there are the general effects like time and volumes, which is apply in the sequence.
Let's look at how it works.
Video: DM: We're going to start with a base in two Siftable sequence, we are the system, we put in a series, we put it in a series, and we add other base.
Now I put a basic line.
Video: DM: Oh adding --
Video: DM: And I'm going to put the filter to the bacteria, so I can control effect from living.
Video: DM: I can fast the entire sequencing the entire sequence.
Video: DM: And I'm going to add the base at the base to give more expression.
Video: DM: I can recombining the sequence "vol."
So I don't have to plan before, but I can improvise, but I can improvise, make it more or more cortas.
And now, finally, I can get the entire sequencing the entire sequence, inclining the Siftable "volume."
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is build new interface interface new manufacturing manufacturing our brain and the body.
And I have time to show you one of the results of this pattern and also some possible possibilities that we try to bring out of the lab in the lab or a few househing out of the lab in the lab of the lab --
The concept I want to turn you is that is coming this new generation of objects to interact with digital media that will bringing information in our world that we want.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the time to talk to you about all of you.
I'm a write write of it.
And I write books is my profession, but it's more than that, of course,
It's also the love and the phascine of my life.
And I don't expect that can change it.
But I said, something particular happened in my life and my career, and my career, which has led me to get the entire recalibrate with this work.
The particular thing is that I recently written this book, this biography called "Mangia, Ama" -- the different parts of my previous libris, for some reason the world and became a big sensational.
And the result is that everywhere you go now, people are treating me as if I were convicted.
By -- convicty, convict!
They come from me and they said, "You don't have purpose and they said, "You don't have purposes to do better?
You don't afraid to keep writing all life without could be able to create a book that can be able to create a book that can be able to someon?"
that can be able to someon?"
It's rangely, you know.
But it could go worse on the worse than 20 years ago, I remember 20 years ago, when I started to say people -- I was a writritician -- I wanted to be a write write -- I want to be a write write.
I met in the same reaction by the fear.
And people said, "Don't be able to have successful to be success?
You don't afraid that the ur hot, you know,
You don't afraid to do this mestick of life without any snothing that was never going to die on a cumulation of the shot to die of the shot to falt the bad of the shot to falliment?"
You know, you know.
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is, "Sy."
I fear of all those things.
I always had to fear of it.
And I also fear of many other things that people might not have to ine.
Like algae and other things spraft.
But as I think I was writing the writing what I thought and I wonderful is why is?
Is it ration?
It's logical logic that anybody would be expected by a work that you feel feel that you feel feel that you feel walking to do.
But what is that particular in the impresely creative to make us live to the mental health mind other career in a way that other career doesn't do?
How do I mean, for example, he was a chemical engineer and not rememical for a time in his 40 years of activity where he was wondered if he was to war if he was to wrap to be engineer if he was to be engineer to be able to engineer the way that was a chemistry in his 40 years of activity in which he was a chemical engineer in which he was a few years of
There was never -- that block of John, like that?
Don't worker like this,
Oestly, the engineers like group wing group not have certainly in the centuries of being alcocolized alcohyaces.
We writers, we have enough this reputation, and not only writers but creative of every general instable of every general instable to be enormous instable to instable in the stable stable of mind.
And it's not rest that look at the contact of the diaths of the magnific deaths of the magnificent of the century, they dies and often for them.
And the ones that they don't have suicide be really disdata from their womens.
Norman Mailer, before I die, in the last interview said, "Ogns my book killed a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than the work of their lives.
But we don't have the way we heard about because we heard these things so long that in some way we have these things that are kind of interiorness and accepted the notion that creativity and the suffering and the arts, the wind, and it will always conduct the wind angood, and it will always get to the angoodh.
And the question I want to ask all of the today is: Are you agree with this idea?
It goes away that -- because it looks like a centimeter of myth, I don't well to anything this suppose.
I think it's hodious.
And I think it's dangangerous and I don't want to see the next century.
I think it's better to encourage our great minds creative to the creative lives.
And I sure in my case -- in my case -- in my case -- it would be very dangerous to the heart of the heart of the circumstances that are in my career.
And it's just a little bit of a great young, I have about 40 years.
I have about four decades of work in me.
And it's very likely any thing that anything I write now going to be right from the world as the work that I used to cuse it on the spring of my last book.
I'm going to be unsky, because we are all more or friends here -- it's likely the most success is that my biggest success is to my shoulds.
Oh, Gesus, that is think!
You know this is the kind of thinking that brings a person to start to begin to the nine morning and I don't want to do it.
I would keep it to do this work that we do.
So, the question becomes like,
And so I seem to go after a lot of reflections, which the way to keep up to keep up to create a psychological construction psychological copsychological construction -- OK?
I have to find a distance of security between me, that I'm writing to me, that I am write and the anxiety that poor write the poor of the way to get the time, trying to find the models on how to do it in the time, trying to find other societies to see if they could have the best ideas and to see if they could have the better ideas and healthy sane healthy and healthier than I could have the most and healthy and healthy in the time to see if they could have the blood idealalalalallow
how to help people creative people to keep in emotional inherents of creativity.
And that research on the ancient Greea and ancient Roma.
And you can see it because I turn it back and then back back in the circle and then back back back and then behind back.
In the ancient Greea and ancient Rome -- people didn't seem to believe that creativity from humans, OK?
And it was thought that creativity was this spirit of the divine and that came to men from a few surface, and unknowing that the shapes to the shot and unknowledge.
The grees called these divines are the spirits of creativity "demoni."
Socrratic sage, he believed to have a demon that elargive saggeity from away.
Romans were in the same idea, but they called the kind of spirit without body a genius.
And that's great, because Romans didn't think that a kind of a genius was somebody particularly smart.
They believed that a geniius was this kind of a divine that it was living in the walls of the study of a artist, a little bit like the elf, and that was the work of the artist, and the outside the result of the artist and modeling the result of that work.
Excectional -- that's the distance of what I talk -- that is the distance of the psychological psychological psychological psychological construction that you have to do it.
And everybody knew that was so that he was so that he worked, right?
So the antic artists were protected to certain things, like the too narcism, right?
If your work was exceptional work was able to take all the market, everybody knew that I had been helped by this incorpore."
If your work failures, it wasn't all of your job, right?
Everybody knew that was your geniius to be a inable to be a inable skill.
And so people have conceived the creativity in the Occident for a long time.
Then the Rinaximment came and changed it all changed, and we have this great idea; we put the human being; we can be in the mistakes, and no longer and no longer and no longer and no longer and no longer and no longer and the mities that write devinity.
This was the principle of the rational of humanity, and people started thinking that creativity from the ipush ished.
And for the first time in history, he started to refer this or the artist as a kind of genius as a kind of genius.
And I have to tell you, I think it was a big herror.
I think that allower someone just a simple person to believe that it's like a recipient like the source, and the surgery and the surgery of all the winds, creatible and ethernal and ethernal and ethernal and ethese, to be a fragile of human beings.
It's like to ask somebody to engineer the sun the sun
Deform, and the completely ego and creates all these ingestible ingestible ingestible expectations on the performance.
And I think this pression to have destroyed artists in the pasts in the past.
And if this is true, and I think the question becomes and now?
Can we do it different?
Maybe I can go back to a more ancient understanding of human relationship between human and mystery creative to be creative to be creative.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we can't cell 500 years of ractional thinking in a 18 minutes.
And probably there is people in the audience that would be ready to woose scientific suspaces on the notion dies, you know, you follow the people who are going to do their projects.
I'm probably not going to convince you all about this thing.
But the question I want to ask is -- why is it?
Why don't don't think it in this way?
Because it has more sense than any other thing that I've ever heard to explain the exasperant process.
A process that you ever have tried to do something -- so basically -- therefore is not combined with it.
And, in fact, it can seemems completely paranormal paranormal paranormal paranormal paranormal paranormal seems.
I did this meet recently with the recently recently Ruth Stone, which has now 90 years, but that was a poeter for the whole life and he said that during his childhood, and he said that in the survey in the rural Virginia, and I heard the wind of the lands came from the landscape.
He said that it was like a reach-air tracks.
And that was going to rolling to the landscape.
And he heard it came to get there, because he had to get the land under the feet.
It knew that we have one thing to do to that point and it was gone to the point and he said, "Look like a morn."
And so it was going to home and it was followed by this poetye, and it wouldn't have to be a piece of paper and a quickly house in fast, and the walking, and the past, and it would be and dealing it on the page.
On one times he could be enough fast, so it was running and running and the rolled and the rolled rolled the rolled rolled the rolled rolled and she would kept stand and he would kept going through the landscape, and he said, "another poet."
Then there were no time -- this piece of the piece of the time I never forget the time that the almost lostated it almost lost, right?
So, he was running home and he was looking for the card and the poetry walked through and they were going to go through the wild and he said, he was going to go ahead and then he said, that was like it was like if you get to the other hand and the off.
And the code from the coda and he put it in his body and put it in his body and critical and the turns on the page.
And in these cases, the poetry would be presented on the perfect and intact the last word on the first one to the first one at the first word to the first one.
So when I felt -- it's crazy exactly the same as I think of my creative process.
I don't all my creative process -- I'm not a convict!
I'm a mule, and my way to work with it is to work on the same horest every day and soulder, and and work and work and work and work on the good.
But even in my mind, in my head -- I was sliped against that thing,
And I imagine a lot of you have the han did.
You know, even if the work and ideas and ideas and ideas I could not have to know.
And what is this thing?
And how can we relate to it in it it until us don't lose your head, rather than to stop it?
And I mean, the best example of me about the best example I have is Tom Waits, which I interviewed different years ago for a day.
We were talking about that, and you know, Tom, and you know, Tom, for the major of life has been the incarnation of contemporary artist, trying to control, dominate these species of the impulses of creative clear clear clear clear creative of the innation of the life has been the incarried in the incarnation of the time to control of the incarnation of the life has been the incarried in the incarnation of the contemporary artist,
But then he was totally hot and a day while he was driving on the highway in Los Angeles, changed everything for him.
He was going to fast and all of a lot of a tiny lodia, which comes in his head as the inspiration, elusive and elusive and and the vacant, and the want, you know, it's wonderful and you know, it's won't how to take it.
It doesn't have a piece of paper -- it doesn't have a matter, it doesn't have a matter.
So it starts to feel this kind of old old old old old old old a little bit of the guy to lose and I'll get obsessionate with this song song as well.
I'm not good enough and I can't do it."
And instead of go into the panic panic stoppanic stoppanic stop.
And I'll put the entire process and they did something completely new thing.
And he just looked at the sky and said, "Scuse, you can't see that I'm driving that I'm driving in the sky shot and he said, "Scuse, you know, I'm driving in the sky and said, "Scuse, you know, I'm driving the sky sky and he said, "Scuse, you know, I'm driving the sky guy.
"To you seem that can write a song song?
If you really want to exist, you know, it goes into a more opportunity when I can take care of you.
Or you have to get somebody else today.
You go to disturbing Leonard Cohen."
And his process worked after that.
Not the work, the work was still dark as you ever ever ever ever ever you know.
But the process, and the fishing anks that was released when the genius, the genius, the genius, the geniusing other than problems and libered it realized back where it was a whole thing and they had to be an interiormed and returned out that he had no interiored.
but well-cliar bizarre collaboration a conversation between Tom and this strange thing that was not Tom and that was not Tom and external and that was not Tom.
So I felt that story began to change a little bit of the way I worked and already saved me a touch.
This idea, saved when I was writing "Mangia, Ama, and Prega, Ama, and droping in one of those climbing in the disperation where we are working on something and we can't think it be a disaster books that will be the worst write, which is going to be the worst write write write written written to me.
Not only bad written just written the worst written written just written the worst written just written the worst written just written just written it.
And I started to think about design.
But then I remembered Tom who talked to the air and tribe.
So I got my face on the handwritten and I would say my comments to a basic angle of the room and I would have a room in the room of the room and I would get my face on the room.
And I said high, "You're both in both of them that if this book doesn't be brilliant not going to be brilliant not going to be the books, right?
Because as you see I can just put all of what I haven't got anymore.
So if you want it to be better and do your party. And you have to do your party.
Okay. But if you don't know what you does, I don't know about it.
I'm going to write the same because it's my work.
And I want to favor that I was recorded to me today I presented to me to do my part, because of the end is there, in the deserts of the North th Africa in the deserts of the North Africa and the sacred of the mossacred and sacking the hours and the hours and until hours and the hours and the hours and until hours and the hours and the hours until the hourd to the hours of the hours of the sacross and the s
And they were always magnificent because the bans were professional and they were fantastic.
But every one of the top, and one of these artists became across reality in translent.
And I know what I know about what I know is, because I know that you have all of the point, a lot.
It was like the time stop, and the walking and the walking ballery walking through a kind of level, and it was not doing nothing different from the usual sun, but everything happened.
And in suddenly not just as a human human human human one.
But you acceses' below up and under in the divinity.
And when this happened, the time they knew what was, they knew what was, they were called his name.
They were junglaps, and they started to singing, "Ah, God God, God, God."
That's God, you know.
And he note the story -- when the Morioric south Sppack the south of the south of the skets and pronounced in the century of "Allah, Allah, Allah, whether you can still feel in the books.
In Spain, when an artist did something impossible and the magic opens, "Ah, oh, oh, but I did, by, but, buttle, except -- one shot of God.
And it's great because we need.
But the problem comes the next day for the ballerine, when you wake up and discovers and discovers that are the 111 morning, and the Dddrinkingday and the Dddyn’t more.
It's just a death-bad death, and maybe it doesn't ever be able to get to that is never going to get that height in that height and maybe it doesn't get a basic death.
And maybe no one dogs will be the named God even while and what it has to do with the rest of his live?
It's hard to hard it.
This is one of the most painful reconciliations.
But maybe it doesn't have to be so angood, if you can not believe, in your needles, that the most expects of your being coming out of you are coming from you you there.
But believed that you just have been in the purposes of this squisite of your life that you have to go to somebody else when you finished it.
And, you know, if we think in this whole whole change.
And so I started thinking about it, and it's surely as I thought for several months in the working book that I'm going to public book I public book -- I was followed by my great success.
And what I have to keep on the time when I feel electric electricrized by this is, not aver wer.
Don't fit at the top. It's just your work.
It contincures to you get you to you, whatever can be.
If your work is ball, they ball, ball, dance.
If the divine, I measure to get some kind of a beautiful kind of a wonderful time through your effort, for just a moment through your effort, then "Ole!"
Or you do the same tumor do the dance.
And "Ole!" to yourself.
I think it out, and I think it would be teaching it.
"Ole!" to yourself, even for the human head, and head to love and textboards to keep in the way.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
As you know I've talked about some of these projects on human genome genome of what can meaning and discovering new set of genes.
We're starting a new percorporate -- we started to digitalize biology and now started from that code code and now from that code code of biology we're entering in a new sunology, designing and synthesizing lives.
We always tried to ask questions.
"What is the life?" is something that many biological biological biological biological biological biological biological biological biological biological biological biological biological biological biological biological biologists I think that many biological biological biological biological biological biological biological biological biological biological biological biological bi
We tried different approach, reducing it to minimmes.
We're digitalizing almost 20 years hours.
When we sequenced the human genome of the human genome of the digital world of the digital world.
Now we asked us to regenerate our lives, or create new life from this digital?
This is the map of a small organism, the Mycoplasma genitalium, which is the smallest genitalium, which is the smallest genome of those who can autoreplicate in the lab of the lab.
And we tried to reduce the genome to create the genome to create a smaller ones.
We are able to eliminate a hundred genes of the about 500 who are here.
But when we look at the metabolic map metabolic map of metabolic respect to the now.
That, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminat, one at the time, it's very unlikely that this can bring to a live.
So we decided the only way the only way to progress to be synthesize this chromosomes in a way that we could modify components to bring some of these questions.
And so we started the wind of the "We can synthesize a chromoom that we can synthesize a chromom of the "We can synthesizing a chromoom of "We can synthesizing a chromom of "We can synthesizing a chromom of "We can synthesizing a chro
Can chemistry to make these great molecules that we never have been able to create before we never have been able to create before?
And, in case of hermative, can we work a chromohers?
A chromosome, it's just a piece of chemical material material inert.
The speed with which we can digitalize life is growing up in exponential rescue is growing to exponent.
Our ability to write the genetic code -- instead, progress rather slow.
And our more recent results the results the door of the curve.
We started 15 years ago.
The process has been required, began with a biothic reviethical reviewing the first experiments.
But we found that synthesize DNA is very difficult.
There are decines of thousands of machines in the world that small segments of DNA, the length of 30 to 50 llegs, and it's a degenerative process.
So we had to develop a new methom to assemble these fragments and rect the herrors.
And this was our first tent, to start from digital information of the digital genome of Phi X 174.
It's a little virus that bacterial batter.
We designed the herrors of herrors and got a molecule and got a molecule of DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters.
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemical material and we put it in the bacterial bacteria and we put it in the bacteria started to reading this genetic code particles in virals.
The virals are then released by cells, they were releleased by the cells, they have been framework and they destroyed E.
I talked about recently with members of the oil industry says that they certainly understood members that they certainly understood this model.
They have more than you have.
We believe that this is a situation where the software can really build his same hardware in a biological system.
But we wanted to do things more in bigger.
We wanted to build the entire chromosome.
They're more than 580 lettes of genetic code of genetic code.
So we thought we could built it in the size of virus, so that we could change the cassets to change the cassets to understand what the components of a living cell.
The design is crucial information and if we start with digital information in a computer, these must be very accurate to be very accurate to be very accurate to be very accurate to be very accurate digital information in a computer, these must be very accurate.
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 the accuratezing standards was a mibasis.
We found out of course, 30 herrors. If we were used that original sequence, we were never able to be able to do it work.
One side of the process is to design segments that are overlapping with all the other segments of 50 letting to build underneath to build smaller tiny tiny tiny tiny working together.
We roject elements here.
You probably read you read that we read the boat.
Think about the thing we do is, we have a based genetic code genetic code genetic code genetic code.
Three of those labor put together in the codifying about 20 lominoacid and there's a specific order to every lominoid of the level.
So we can use genetic code to write word and words, fraise thinking.
What we did we have done in the beginning was self-supply it.
Some of the fact that it was not poet.
We designed these segments to just just just just to just just just just just to just just just just to connect with the same things.
There are enzymes that repair and put them together.
And we started assembling the particular seed by seasing several seats from five to seven miles of 24 miles of letter to the segments of the letter to come to 72 militerally to sell to get 72 milliterally to set the liters.
We have produced these segments in abundance to be able to sequence them so that we can sequence, we are trying to create a tremely robuster -- how you will see in a minute.
We're trying to automatize the process.
So, this seems the table, it seems to be a basic plays.
When we get to these very longments very longments, more than 100 miles -- they don't grow more directly in E.
You get to the limb tools of the modern biology biology biology.
So we have to consider other mechanisms.
We knew about another mechanism called recombination of omology that in biology to repursue the DNA degrees in the degree of the segments.
Here's an example.
This organism, called Deinococcus radio in three million radiodurans, can absorbing three million radiation.
You can see in the high school in the high school is destructed.
In 12 -- 24 hours is just like it was just like it was before.
They have thousands of organisms that are able to do it.
These organisms can be completely sitting in the time.
They can live under a vote.
I'm absolutely sure that life exists in space, and you move to find new environments.
In fact, NASA showed that this view of this availing.
This is a picture of the molecule that we built using these process, just using the lievidence with the design appropriate segments.
The lievidence of the automatically assembly in the realmically.
This picture was taken with an electronic microscopie, but with a microscope microscope of rule.
It's a great molecule that we can see it with a microscopie.
These are pictures that covered a period of about six seconds.
This is the publishing that we did a little time ago.
They're more than 580,000 lettes of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code.
It's the biggest molecule of a defined structure that ever created by man.
It has a weight molecular high school at 300 million people.
If we were going to passive it with a ten 10 packless pages to just crith this genetic code.
Now, how do we work it work? How can we activate it?
Of course, you can track is a game of kids.
It's a little bit more complicated when they use batters.
It's more simpler than the eucar cells as our res: you can just extract the nucleus and put another one one another, which is basically the process.
In the bacterium archaea cell of the cell phone is integrated in the cellule, but we recently demonstrated that we are able to do a cell of a cell cell of a cell cell phone and activate to another and active it.
We cut a crump of a microbial species from a microbial species.
The two are different than the tough men are from the touch.
We added some genes in a way that we could decide what choosing for this chromosom for this chromosom
And it was slight-gaping with the proteins in a way to killer all the proteins.
And when we put it in the cellum is stuff -- and you just appreciate our chromosome, the new chromosome, the new cell cell phone.
And we started thinking we couldn't go beyond that, but we tried to get over there.
This is one of the biggest mechanisms of evolution.
We found that a lot of species have added a second or a third or a third of a few hundreds of new thousands of new tracts to the species.
So who thought about evolution as just a gene gene that we don't understand a lot of the biology is not a lot of biology.
They have the inner of the restriction, is that we have DNA.
The chromosomes that was in cellum cellum is not a one.
The cell phon-crum, which we put it on the ha.
And it turns out to recognized the other hand, and we have the other half as an extrankly, and we found only with the cells and the new cell and the new cell and the new chromoom and the new chromodem and the new chromohersososoun.
it became blue, because of the genes we have inserved.
And in a short of time, all the characteristics of a species are gone in a species and it turns into a new species, the new species, on the new species, which we put in the cells.
All the proteins are changed, and when we read the genetic code of the genetic code genetic code of what we have transfer to what we have transfer with it.
Now, this could be genetic alchemy genetics, but altering the software DNA we can change the things in enough household.
Now, I explained that you don't talk about genesis -- but to progress from three million years of evolution, and I said that maybe we are already to create a new version of the Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosion of this digital process.
Why do that?
I think it's enough obvious enough when we think about our needs.
We're going to go from six billion and a half billion in the next 40 years.
Just to give an example: I was born in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for each one in 1946, in 1946, in 40 years, they will be four.
We're going to have to find food, cool clean and clean and clean and gas, gas, gas, and gases of people.
It's going to be harder for nine billion.
We clizing more than five billion carbon dibonds, more than 30 billion bars.
That means a hundred million books.
When we look at a biological processes or any kind of process to replace them, it will be a huge challenge them, it will be a huge challenge of the biological processes.
We have to keep the whole emission of CO2 emission of CO2 emission of these materials that ended up in the atmosphere.
At the day, thank you to the scientific discoveries around the world, we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I like to think that the skill components designed for the future.
The electronic industry has only one dozen about the electronic, and think about how many different things came out.
Our limits here are principlely by biological reality and our imagination.
Now we have techniques, thanks to these qupieces of synthesization, in creating what we call genomics.
We are able to build a big robot that can produce a million chromosomes a million hundred chromosomes a day.
Think about processing these 20 million different genes or to try to get the process to get the processes to make a drugs, new vaccines, we can change and make biology a little team, and create biology in the last 20 years of science.
And it's just a standard.
We can chemical chemistry of survival, chemistry or carbonons, chemistry of chemical vaccines.
This is an instantanee of some software programmed to be able to sitting ourselves and designing species in the computer.
Well, we don't know necessarily as they wouldn't
We know exactly what their genetic code.
Now we're concentrying on the carbonons of fourth generation.
You also seen you see the etanol from the grand ethanol experiment of the bad.
We have a second floors of second and generation that will come up pretty soon as the sugar carbor whatever, as the types of the butans.
But the only way biology can have a big impact without more impact without more constantly the cost of the food and limited the diom of the warming CO2 in the material we are working in the ways, and we can reach this discovering that can reach this discover, and we think we could reach this discovered in about 18 months.
The solar light with CO2 is a methodo: but in our discoveries all over the world, we found different methods.
This is a organism we described in 1996.
It lives in the deep ocean deep about 2,500 feet of the water of the water boildition of water.
It creates the CO2 using hydrogen.
We're trying to understand if we can put CO2, which can be simply to be transported to be transported by the CO2 in carbant, to drive that CO2 in the carbant, to drive this process.
So we can increase the oil we could be able to increase what the basic questions about the basic questions is Not, versus -- we have the goal of the oil billion the oil of the oil industry.
Exactly. If you can't do it from TED, where you can do that?
It would become a major of energy.
And then we're working for using the same stantaneous methods to create vaccines.
You saw this year with influence and we are always background a year and a dollar, and a dollar, in less when you treat the right vaccine.
I think that what you can change build vaccinable changes in ancient vaccinable in ancient anticipat.
That's how the future could start to change seem to change it, now, the evolution, the evolution, accelerating the evolution with synthetic bacteria and indeed, and they cells.
We're at so much the best people.
Our purpose is to make a long way of live to try to do it. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
First of everything I will see the most quickly possible, a few work fundamental work that we have taken to Microsoft in the followed to a water age. This is Seadragon.
It's about a environment where you can interact is a local level, which remote with a huge amount of visual data --
And here we're seeing a lot of gabytes of digital photos with a kind of zoom and continuous fast-up, availing images as we want.
And it doesn't matter how big amount of information that we see it, how big we see that we see, or images.
Most of them are communicated digital, but this for example is a scansion from the Bilibrary of Congresss, and he came in the Congresssel.
It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that the prestations of a system as this is the number of place in your pattern in the moment. It's also an architecture. It's also an architecture.
This is an internal book, example of data not images.
This is the Sun-desolated Dickens. Each the cooman represents a capitom
To demonstrate that is just about textbook, and we can do something like that, to see really what generates is a real representation of the head, not a real representation of the head, not a real-fight.
It could be a little artificial way to read an electronic book electronic book
You don't think it goes to be it.
This is an example of the Guardian example of the Guardian.
Each image is the beginning of a section.
And it gives you the pleasure and the beautiful experience of a cartaceous version of a jump or a quotidd of a type of a half a lot of half half a lot of half a lot of half a lot of half a lot of half a very lot.
We also did something with the angle of this number of the Guardian.
We created a high-resolution advertising -- much more than what you use in a normal publish. And we had insert in the normal publish.
If you want to see the characteristics of this self-up, you can see here.
Or other models, or even the specific specific specific specific specific specific specific and even specific specific specific and techniques.
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on the screen.
We hope that this means to put pop-up and other similar and other similes, not have to be needed to be needed to be needed to be needed to be needed to be needed to be needed to be needed to be needed to put a lot of other similes.
Natually, the maping is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology.
And I don't want to lose time, if not to say that we have contributed to give in this field.
These are all the way in the U.S. obotpatial image of NASA.
So now we go to something else.
This is actually from the webskin the web; you can see it.
It's a project called Photosynth, which combines two different technology.
One is Seadragon and the other is a very interesting research, a very interesting computer that Noah Snavely, a student of Washington, with the aid of Steve Seitz of the Washington, with the U.S. and Resear. Some Resch. Sezeo-U.K. Resch. United ed the U.K. S. Seadragon and the other Microsoft Reschrosoft Rescho-Sezeeum in the other research
And it's from the web, gestished by Seadragonon.
You can see it when we do this kind of screen that we can go from one image of the other and have this kind of multiple, and have this kind of multiply resolution to multiple.
But the space of the images here actually actually has a meaning.
The computer algorithms of visualization have recorded these images together in the realm that you can run the reals in the real-up and the Grass -- all the near sleeping Grashes -- have been taken on the Montages -- have been taken or images of a slide-show showed the space.
I don't know if I have time to show you some other environment.
There's a few more spacal space.
I want to go directly to one of the original data set of Noah-- and this is from a previous degree of Photosynth that we have done to work for the first time the first time you have done for the first time -- to show you what I think is really the key is really not necessarily to the environments that we put in the website.
We had to worry about legal aspects and saying.
This is a rebuilding in the CArral Dame images that were taking images from Flickr. Basta digitating Notare Dame in Flickr. And you get images of the types in the shirt of the types of the field and view of the represents an appearing this model.
So they are all pictures from Flickr and they were all colleged in space this way.
And it's possible to navigate in this simple.
You know, I never thought I was going to work for Microsoft.
It's very gratify to get this kind of connection.
I think you can see that it's a lot of different types of different types of the phones of the cellular phones in the those of the SLR, a meaningful number of meaningful types in this environment.
And if you can try to look at those strange strange.
Many of them are blocked, etc.
It has a few holds of photographs -- etch of photographs -- etcol.
This is a Notre poster Dame recortly.
We can go from the poster to physics of this environment.
The essential point, is that we can do things with social environment. This is now taking from everything -- from the entire memory of how we appearing the land of view -- and it all those data together.
All of those pictures become lined with the most of the species.
You've got a model of the entire that emerge.
Think about this as the motion of Stephen Lawler work on Earth virtual Earth.
It's something that is grows in complexity as people using the people usual usual and the vantages for the people who use it with use.
Their pictures are brand in the middle of other people.
If you get some idea of contransacting all these seaway all these sanits, my picture of Notre Dame suddenly Dame suddenly Dame suddenly of all those data and I can use the data in the data of the skin that universe, in that universe, in that universe, in that universe, in that universe, and have an experience of the kind of a little social experience of the guys, and I can use the boths and the red of the sk-user.
Natually, a consequence of all of this is extremely elaborated virtual virtual models, not just as much as a view airplanes and similar images and similar, but the memories of the collective views and similes.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I understood well? What your software will be concut us to do is that at some point, in the next years, all the photographs shared everyone in the world will be practically colleague,
BA: Yeah. What is doing is actually discover.
He's creating hyperlin, if you want to hyperline, between images.
And it's doing it base at the content of images.
The thing becomes very interesting if you think the wealthy wealthy of information that many of these images possibly have to be a lot of these images possibly have to be a lot of these images that many of these images that many of these images that many of these images that many of these images possibly the wealthy of these images.
And as you do a research of images on the web, and the head on the web has a lot of information about the pictures of the pictures of the pictures.
Now, what happens if that picture is the photos of all your photos do you
So the amount of interconnection, and the amount of wealthy wealthy that is really huge of the network. It's a classic effect.
CA: Blaise, it's really amazing.
BA: Thank you very much.
One of the main pleasures when you travel and one of the ethodd research of the ethos that we don't forgot to the anti-traditions, between the wind of the place in the wind of the place in the wind of plants.
Basti thinking that slips Jaguar is still beyond the Mily Way or the myths of the ancient antians are still in Himalaya, or the himalaya, to remind the respire remind of the anthropoloy of the anthropoloy and the idea that we live not exists in the sense of the reality, but it's just a model of reality, but it's just a model of reality,
the consequence of a particular set of adaptations that our stirps that our stirps of the bad, many generations.
And, of course, we all share of essential tracts.
We all all the way we produce.
We're subjected to the initiation.
We have to deal the inexorse death, so we don't surprising and we don't surprising and whales --
all of we have an art.
What it is the broader of the realm of the dance of the dance of every culture.
It doesn't matter that they are the Borneo, or the Borneo, or the following Haiti, or the Carands of the Kaissut in Kaisut in Kaissut in Kaissut in Kenya section, or a camelithere, or a camelium.
He was my journey in the desert of journey in the desert of yak in the valley in the games of Qomolangma, on the Everest, the deain the world.
All of these populations teaching us that there are other ways of thinking, other ways of thinking, other ways of thinking, other ways of thinking, other ways of thinking, other ways of thinking, other ways of thinking, other ways of thinking, other ways of thinking, other ways of thinking, other ways to think about other ways to think about it is to be able to think about other ways of thinking, other ways to think about other ways of thinking, other ways of thinking, other ways of thinking, other ways of thinking, other ways of thinking, other ways of thinking, other ways of
And you can get a moment, it's a concept that can give you hope.
And so I ember, the miridge of cultures of the world create a raise and cultural and cultural to the planet and it's important for the well-become rather than the planet, as the raise of the planet so as biosphere.
And you can think of this ragnailable cultural as an etnosing ethnose. And you can call the ethom the total of all the concepts of all the concepts of all the concept of the consciousness of the consciousness of consciousness from the human consciousness of consciousness of the conscious consciousness of the consciousness of all the consciousness of all the conscious conceptive of the eth.
The ethnos: The fantastic remonuy.
It's the symbol of what we can be in as a species of what we can be in the inquisite than we can be in the inquist of what we can be in the inquist of what we can be in the inquist of what we can be in the inquisvarious species.
And because the biosphere was gravy consumed as well as it was a lot more rapidly.
No biology, for example, it would say 50 percent of all the species has been or on the horest extinction because it's false -- in the most hypocality, or the most hot hypot of biological diversity -- and not near the most of the biological diversity -- that of the biological diversity -- that of the cultural diversity -- that of the diversity -- that is the most of the hypothese,
The indication of all of this is, of course, the language.
When you were born there were 6,000 languages on this planet.
One language is not only a vocabulary or from a series of rules grammatical.
One language is the shot of human spirit spirit of human spirit spirit of the human spirit spirit of the human spirit of the human spirit spirit of the human spirit of the human spirit of the human spirit of the human spirit spirit of the human spirit spirit of the human spiri.
It's the mean that the animal of every culture comes in material.
Each language is a forest of the mind, a wink, a thinking, a thinking, an ecosystem of spiritual possibilities.
And those 6,000 languages, while we are here in Monterey, at least half the half is not suspect in the ears of children.
They don't get more teached to children, and the children, unless you know, not walready knowledge.
What is more than the tristick of being volved by the silence, the last talking about a language of the advancy of being able to transmit the wisdom of the children's kid?
This is doing this is the state of somebody in some part of the world every two weeks a few weeks a few weeks a woman and door with the last sillabe of a anguy sillabes of a anguy.
And I know that somebody will tell "Isn't it better like?
The world would not be a better place if we all talk the same language?" Bensyno, then we talk all around yuba. We talk yoruba.
We talk to the kogi.
You will not be about a tract thing that you don't have to talk about their language.
I would like to do you have to do a journey through ethnoser --
a little journey in the ethnosing ethoxage of what we're lost.
Many of us forgot that when I say "different ways of existing existing existing really different ways of exists.
We take for example this bimbo Barasan Amazony Barasazon the weden, the population of the anaconds, which creates in the military of the west skest sacric of the west skest sacris.
It's a popular population that is not able to distinguishing the blue color, because the celests is identified in the forest, which is identified in the forest, which is identify in the forest, which is identify in the forest, which is identified the blue.
They have a strange language and a mathematrimonial regular language, "English language, you have to get a different language.
Everything has been in the past, the mythological mythology is that in these exterms are talking about six or seven language in the mistay marriages because of the mysts of a language.
They listen to listening and then they start talking about.
We take one of the most interesting tribes that I lived in the Waorans of Ecuador in the Waorld Waorld Waorld tribal population that the first contact in 1958.
In 1957 mission mission of mission of a committed contact mission --
They made it from the house of photographs that were retouched that he had friendly wildly wilding, that this population of the pluasure forest, never seen anything where.
They got a shot photograph of the land, they turned out to a form or a figura -- they don't find nothing, they have concluded that was the divol, and they killed the dirty with the simission with the level.
But the Waorananans don't just kill the straniers.
They kill the way in them.
Five percent of the mortality was caused by their own stand.
We are risalitites at eight generations, and we found two natural deaths of the people who were insisted that one of them was aging that one of them was aging that they died in the mind of the same. And then they killed him all the time, they had a knowledge of the forest.
The cactors were able to recognize the animal from 40 steps and recognized the species.
In the early '80s, it was a very interesting comfortable tassigned when my Harvard professor of Haiti to get Haiti to intrupholating societies to the base societies to the base societies and Tonton the basis and TontMacoutes, and imposed me to do the zombies.
To give a sense to miracle miracle Vodouble, I should understand the Vodddn culture.
It's pretty much of a metaphaphysics of the world.
Very interesting.
If I ask to tell me the big religions, what would direct?
Cristianesime, Buddhym, Buddhymo, Exibrush, Exibrush.
A continent is always left out of the sub-Saharan Africa-Saharan Africa, and the Voodoo doo is not that the distilled of these religious concepts of these religious concepts in the tragics of the slavery of the slavery of the slavery of the slavery of the slavery of the slavery of the slavery of the slavery is not that the slaverish of the slavery of the slavery of these religious sslaveharian islave concep
What makes you interesting the voodoo is the intense of life and death.
So you can live the spirits.
And you can be invocated by the Great Aqua, respond to the dance of the dance and they replace in the dance and they replace to the view in a short way that for a short of the following becomes the dio.
So you have to say "You white say, "You white white people go to talk about God.
We go in the temple, and we become God."
And from the moment you are going to be driven you drive, how can you drive you drive, how can you do it as a mal?
So you see these incredible amazing events. I follow the touching chodor in the path of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the body when they catalyzed in a state of excited extremely excited in a state of exciting exciting in a state of exciting exciting events.
And all the popular popular popular popular popular people's the most amazing Kogi Sierra de Santa Mar, in the Colombia in the Colombia settly.
They're going to slide ancient civilizations, which once they lived on the books of Colombia in the conquer of the conquer -- the population was going on vulcanic massive dic middle of charair who were going on on the carasic miles.
In a blood blood blood that this popular popular has never been conquered by the spagnow.
At the today are governed by a classic but their formation formation is a very extraordinary extraordinary --
The young people are taken from the family to three or four years, and they live in a housecret of four and shoes in the half of the glacior in the lacior for 18 years.

So the one time, they are acculated to the values of their society, values that are predicting their prayers and only their prayers and only their prayers and only the balance -- or to say the balance -- or to say the equilibrium -- or to say the balance of their society,
And in terms of this amazing beginning, they are improven out and for the first time in the age of 18 years, they see a albathy of the first time in the purpose of the first wrong bad, when the sun the sun of the beautiful lands of the beautiful less, everything that they learned in the theory is conferred and saying, "The pretty much fe is going back and saying,
"Do you do? Proprise how I said,
It's stuff up. It's going to protect it."
They call the bigger brothers and say that we have, brothers are the minors, we are the pieces of the world.
This level of intuition is extremely important.
When we think about the indigenous populations and the environment in the environment story of the noble history of the noble history or maybe Thororeasier or maybe Thoreasier or maybe we think that these populations are closer to the Earths are closer to the Earth.
The indigenes are not feeling in the nor popular popular popular popular popular popular popular popular popular popular popular popular popular popular popular popules are not feelings.
There's no space for these things in the Ahsmall of the Ahsmall wind gelies in the time and the them, but because of the time and they created a mystical concept of the Earth of the based in the concept of the Earth, but in a well-being: the concept that the Earth: the concept that the Earth, but the consciousness of human human beings.
What does it mean it?
And when you go down to the And, who grows that grows that the mountain is a Apu that will be a deep Apu that will be a deployed to be a deployear and it will have a very different deeply of the mountain a different Montana girls or that grows is a mountain of Montana is a drug of rockets is a masses of rock to be scaved.
which is the dimora minal mineral or a mineral mineral is irrievant.
What is interesting is the interesting metaphor that defines the report between individual and the natural world.
I grew up in the forests of Columbia Britannical forests of the Columbia in cut to be cuttered.
That has gone to me be different from my friends Kwakiutl who believe that the forests are the dimora dimora Hukukukuk and the well-wing cannibal history and the cannibal history of the world, spirits that are facing the Hamatsa.
If you start to consider these cultures can create different reality can start understand some sensations. We take a plant. We take this plant. We take this plant.
I took this picture took the normazony in the normazony normal Amazonidental Amazonies.
Maybe some of you have heard about ayahuask -- the most powerful psychoactive of the sciamanic repertorium of the sciamanic repertorie.
What makes fascinating ayaxis not the potential is not the potential of the chologic of the choice, but his elaboration. It's composed to two elements.
On one side, this lian lian wood conties that conties a series of beta-carboline, harmly hallucinogen.
Prending the only plant is a piece of the coffee that alters a little bit of the coffee -- but it's micro-like households of the coffee of the coffee of the coffee of the coffee of the coffee of the coffee of the coffee of the coffee of the coffee of the coffee the coffee of the coffee of the coffee of the coffee the coffee of the coff.
This is a plant, very similar triptamine, very similar servotonine, dimethoxoydimethoxoydimethoxoydimethoxoydimethoxoydimetho.
If you ever see Yanomami of Yanomi to the nose the sustance of the sustance of the site of species, which is that they do in methoxoydimethoxoydimethoymm.
To get that police on the nose is a little bit like being shot from a type of barocks, and lapping on a sea of electricity.
I was often with my professor, Richard Evan Shultes, the man who scates the shot was psychedelic, with his discovered hallucinogens in the 1930s in the 1930s in Mexico.
And I think my type you can classifix triptamines like hallucinogens because if you don't have to be able to tell anybody of being hallucined.
It's possible to assumption, only if I assummic with other chemical chemical chemical chemical reckets that are the MAO.
Now it's the beauti: the beta-carbinin-carbon is the MAO, the same kind of needs to potentiate trip. The same kind of needs to potentiate trip. The smidle of plants, like these popules are going to find two death, but if you combined in this way. But if you combined in this way?
We use the great euphemism of the proof the mistake and herror, that can be infrupted.
But if we ask Indians, they will tell us "The plants speak to us."
What does it mean it?
This tribe, Cofan, 17 varieties of ayax, which they didnettely distincluding in the forest, and that the eyes would come in the same species.
If you ask him how stabilish their tassonomy are going to tell us a plant, I thought, the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest ong?"
The solution is: you take 17 variety in a night of laptop, and each dog with a different tun.
With you don't have Harvard, but it's much more interesting than you count the esterams.
Now, the applausible is that the ones of us who have to heart the people who have to heart the indigenous popules of the history of the respect to our real world and it can go away to our real world.
In fact, the 20th century, between 300 years, not be remember for his wars or the wars or the wars or the wars of technological innovations, but rather like it was where we stopped and we have habbrushed in the destruction of biological diversity and the problem is not change. On the problem is not change. On the problem is not change.
All cultures have been involved in a dance to new dance of life.
And the problem is not technology.
The Indians Sioux doesn't stopped to be Sioux when they put from the side and freck and how Americans don't have stopped to be Americans when they put in the hororse and calmess.
It's not the change or the technology that they threat the integrity of ethnos: power.
The during the domination.
And if you give you a look at the world, you discover that these are not destined cultures in disappearing.
They're living and dynamics and dynamics out of identify forces that are going to beyond their ability to adaptations.
And that is that you can be able to disbooking in the patric patric of the guy --

And it's upon to remember that our species is existed for 600,000 years.
The Revolution in Neolity, which gave us agriculture, which has done us to the seeds of the seeds, by supplying the slide with the slide of the clerd, creating the gerarchy of the specialization, and we talk about 10,000 years ago.
The modern industrialized world has 300 years.
That sharks a story doesn't suggests that we have the answers to all the challenges that we have to face in the millennia to come in.
When these myridge of cultures of the world is asked what it means to be humans, respond to 10,000 different voices.
And it's in these answers that we all all responsible response to be what we are. And we are a conscious species that we are all the popules and all the gardens and all the gardens and all the gardens of optimism.
I took this picture on the north of Build island of Baffin, when I went to the whales I went to the whales of the Inuit -- and this man tells me the wonderful story of his grandfather.
The canades government is not always always running with Inuit and in the '50s, to stabilide our sound to stabilide in colonies.
The grandfather, he refused to go on it.
The family, templing for his life, and he took all the arms and all of his arms.
You have to know that Inuit not the cold cold, the freeze, they don't cut the cold,

And finally, I think it's pretty obvious at least to the people of us who have been in these remoty zones of the planet, I realized that they don't have remote.

And they represent sections of the human imagination that they risk at the high of us all these children, like the needs of our kids, like the needs of our kids, become part of the geography.
Finally, National Geographic is we convinced politicians that politicians will never come anything.

in which the wisdom of all the popular popular population can contributing our well-being collective well-being that is a well-being packing.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some things I wrote in this book that I hope I hope I hope I hope and I will not have heard and I will not have notaste.
I want to start with what I call "the offical."
The official dogm dog, what?
The official dog, the official societies industrial societies in the Western societies, "If we want to massimize the well-being, "The way to be is to massive libert."
The reason that is from a side of the liberty is in the fact that the liberty is precious, essential essential to human beings.
As the other is that if we are liber, each of us can act to do what massisimizes to do everything that we do our well-being, without no one that decide in our well-being, without no one that decide in our well-being, without any one that they decide in our well-being, in the other male of us can act to do everything that we are liber,
The way to massive liberty is to massimize freedom is to be the choice.
More people choices people are liber, more liber, and more the liberty, more than the liberty, more than they well.
These are the retextremely radicated in society that nobody would have dream of himself in the twice.
And it's also deeply radicated in our lives.
I'm going to show you some examples of what the progress can possible.
This is my supermarket. It's not particularly large.
I allow it to just just a simple named on the conditions.
In my supermarket there are 175 conditions, without contact 10 varieties of oil and 12 acets and 12 acets acets you can buy a number of holies that you can buy in a cycle of the inner inskills in the circumstances in your degree and the 175 already already is your degree of your degree degree and the 12 acets already to buy to buy a huge number of halready and in the
Here's the supermarket.
Then you go to buy the electronic stere: CD, casslector CD, Blector CD, Blififish.
And in this single negotiat, there's a big number of audio of audio components.
We can do six million different and a half million different combinations using components that there are in one negotie.
You have to admit that there's a lot of choice.
Other the world of the communications.
Once, when I was a child, you could get all the cell phone to the phone of the cell phone to woman who were going to be myth.
He woolled the phone didn't buy it.
One consequence of that, in the other one was that the phone doesn't break up in the phone of it.
These are gone.
We have a variety of phones almost illititated phones between cellphones.
Here's the phones of the future.
My favorite is the middle, the basic basis of the nose and the form in the middle of the crashes.
If you don't have seen in the house store in the house, you're well well certain you have been well certain you still seen in the house stop.
And what happens is that people entering in the snow and this question. And you know what the answer is the answer?
It's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn't do too many things.
So, in other aspects of life that are much more important than the water of the explosion of choices.
Assistance, is not going on in the United States that you go from doctor and the doctor of what you have to do.
Instead, I go from doctor, and the doctor says, "Okay, we could do A, or B" "A, you could do it and these risk" well-well-well-well-well-well. What do you want to do?"
You said, "Dr, what should I do?"
And the doctor says, "As these well-these risks, and BBs have these risk."
"What do you want to do?"
And you rebat the beat "Dror if she was doing?"
And the doctor: "But I don't am I not her."
The result we call it the "autonomy of the malato," expression that it seems a beautiful thing.
But in fact, it's not that one shift and responsibility of the decisions that you know somebody knows what you know is the doctor, and somebody else -- and almost certainly is not in the conditional conditional decisions to take the patient.
There is a huge marketing products drugs, direct to people like me and you, if you think of it doesn't have any sense, that we don't have any sense, that we can buy it.
But if we can't buy them, why do you publish?
The answer is that they want dom, we call the doctor to ask them,
Something of so fundamental is our identity of the horest is a choice, as you see in this view in this viewing children. They will not want to force. We have to investmention. We have to invent the right moment. We have to invent the right not.
And we can reinvented us as many times we aggrate it.
That means that every morning in the morning to the risk up to decide that kind of person wants.
Rispace to the family and the marriage of the common time perspective of the pointer as a pointer as it was that you could get the pretty much as possible, and it started to get the most preon possible.
The only real choice was with choice was with choice -- and not even what to do later.
Ogy, everything is really to play.
I teach students very smart, and I think about 20 percent less than a time.
And because they don't are less brilliant, because they are less diligent.
but because I am impensiers, I meant to ask I said, "I should get it or I can do it now?"
"I should be married? I have thought before I do it before I do it or the career?"
They're interrogatives of logoriant interrogatives
And they try to answer these questions, even if this implements don't completely to be the compites and not get a well.
And they have to do it. They're important.
Now, the work: we are lucky, like Carl Worteave, because technology allows us to work every day, from every day, from every day, from the Hotel Randolph.
Twentess, there's a corn, and I'm not going to tell anybody whom the WiFi works.
I don't say that, because I want to use it.
What does this mean, this amazing liberty liberty that we have to keep the work? What we have to keep in every moment, if we have to work or not.
We can go to see our broad has, with the cell phone in the tas, Blackberry in the other, and the kneeds in the typical and the knee.
And even though they're all pushing every minutes we see our child we see the game, we are also asking the game, we are also asking this call?"
"I have to answer this email? I got to hable?
And even when the answer is "no," all this makes the experience of your child very different than what would be in other conditions.
So, from any part we look at it, small things and big materials and big materials and big, life is a question of choices.
And one time the world was this: Ove, there were a few possibilities, but it wasn't all a question of choice.
The world today is like this. The dilemma is, "Ilemma is a positive thing to the negative or negative negative now.
The answer is Shim.
The positive side of the negative we all talked about the negative ones.
All this choice two negative effects two negative effects on people.
The first one, paradoxy, is that produces instead of liberation.
Won many options of options that choose, it becomes very hard to do it.
I give you an example meaningful example of mean to conduct plans of thinking about voluntary plans.
A minute of my colleagues in the Vansed, the giant society of the deployees of thinking with about a million clients in 2,000 different companies.
What she found is that for every 10 solutions that are all 10 solutions that are offered more and offered adesion.
With 50 sources there is 10 percent less of the less of adesions when they have available only 5. Why?
Because with 50 foundations of the books, is detailly hard to decide and choice is remained to the indemath and the choice is remained to question.
And asked question, and asked question, question, and of course, questions and of course, questions not made.
You know, it doesn't just mean that these workers are going to be able to deal with cans because they don't have enough money, they don't have money, you want to say that the decision is so open the foundation of the data work.
Don't participatand they're losing until the way from the working data from the work, which would be well well to the cut them.
So the paralysis is a consequence of having choices.
And I think it is the world like that.
"And finally, for ethen, for ethis: "ethish or or majiones?"
You would like to take the right decision if it's about ethise, right?
You don't want to choose the wrong wrong and nep, and the wrong condition
So this is the first effect. The second is that even though we can avoid paralysis and do a choice, we are less loud of the result as we were in less with less options in the way we were with less options in the way we were going to be with less options in the sand.
And this for different reasons.
One of these is that with a lot of conditions that you could have choose, and you buy one and it doesn't perfect and it's not perfect to be able to do a different choices that would be better at the time that the alternative alternative imagined in the choice, and the remains of choice, and the remaining the choices of the press,
even when it was a great decision.
More choices usually hasle anything detailing than whatever detailing of the choice.
And yet the opportunities.
Dan Gilbert ckar very well stamacine as the value that we are the value that we depends on what we confronts.
And in the stay of the options, it's easy to represent the alternative characteristics of the options of the option that you have choice.
Here's an example. I just use all the ones that are not New York.
But it's what you probably think you probably do.
There's this couply to Hamptons.
A place of luximuries.
It became bedrop. Otype newspaper. It's all for them.
Nothing that he thinks is what he thinks is, "Well, the diom thinking, is Augosto."
"Everyone of Manhattan are alized."
I could talk about the house in front of home."
And it turns two weeks assilled by the idea that is losing -- every day -- the chance of parking parking where you want.
The expensive opportunity demines the demines of what we have, even when the choice has been excellent.
And the more opportunities we have to consider the more characteristics are going to come back to the way against as expensive opportunity.
Here's another example.
This view tells us a lot of things.
We talks about the time and maybe live at the time and maybe live slowly.
But the most important point is that any thing you choice, you choices you choice is not to do anything else.
The things that we don't choose have a lot of four active that can make less attraent what we do.
Tero: I mean, the spiral growing expectations.
I tried on my skin, I tried on my skin,
I began an an jeans.
Once jeans were just a type, they buy and westive them and clothed by bestive them a lot of times, only after they brought a life and the basic and they were getting well.
So, I went to buy a couple new time when the old ones were gone, and I said, "I need a couple of jeans, this is my cuteans, this is my cute."
The committed said, "You want you to slim fit, and ashim and phittered folk?"
You want to do you to the cernight or the bottons or the bottons or "Stoneby?
"Liking?"
"Sotbasis or stretty? Bla -- the blakblay?
I was hear in the wind, and after a little bit I could say, "I want the only kind of cheans, which was the only typical guy, so I could all the way I tried all the way I was going to all of the disease in the best couple of jeans, and the best couple of jeans that I had had been able to say.
It was the massium -- all that choice had the best basis.
But I felt I got worse it.
Why? I wrote a book about it.
The reason I was worse with the whole whole thing is that I was with the whole whole myself was altish altish jeans had to be perfect for perfect there.
I started expectational minimes. I didn't expected anything when I expected it only was a guy that was a type, at least kind of a types, at least a kind of being perfect.
What I had water was good -- but not perfect it.
After I was talking about what I was going to try to get what I was trying to get in confront to the expectations.
The add of options in the life of the people don't have expectations that these have respectations of options.
And this will make less sodden less sodden when the results are good.
None in the world of the marketing world in the world of it.
Because if you know that, you would not know what I'm talking about.
The truth is more like this.
"You were better when he was worse when he was wors." The reason he was better when it was worse when it was worse when he was going to be able to meet the surprised of the surprised pleasures.
Ogday in the world we live -- opulent, industrialized citizens with expectancy -- the massix-six-size that we can hope is that things are the things in the height of expectations.
You never have you have never surprised because your expectations, the myes, the mies expectations, you have injuries.
The secret of happiness -- what you're here -- is like, "Bassectact."
I mean, small moment, I mean, I really got married and my wife is really amazing and my wife is really amazing
I could not have to do better, I don't have to be contented.
But you can not always account is a bad thing.
And finally, a consequence of buy jeans comfortable jeans of the jeans is that when you don't know whether you're not satisfact, and you ask yourself, and you ask yourself, "Why?"
Who is responsible.
The world is responsible. What could I do about that?
When there are hundreds of jeans, and you buy a jeans, and you ask you to the responsible is responsible, and you ask you the responsible you to the responsible you to the responsible you to the slide of you are there.
You could do it better.
Won hundreds of varieties, there are no windness for the insuccess.
So when people take decisions, even if the result is valike, you feel insods, they feel insods, and they don't have them themselves.
In the last years the depression is exploded in the industrialized world industrialized
I think that a meaning that a meaning -- not the unique, but the important -- but this is the ondata that people have experiences in deludge deludge of deludging because the standards.
And when they have to explain this situation think the cope is they think it is them.
So the final result is that we are better better than we are better, objectively, but we feel worse.
Let me tell you you that.
This is the offical, the offical, what we all take for good and it's completely false. It's not true.
There is no doubt that a little bit of choices that don't have to have no matter that you don't have a lot better than a lot better than a little bit.
There's a critical, magic value. I don't know what it is.
But I'm sure we have been found that we have been overlevel, where the miles the best choices are our lives.
Now, from the political point of view -- I almost finished the follow.
What it allows you all this choice in industrial society is the material society.
There are a lot of places in the world, and you know what the problem isn't that they have a choice.
The problem is that they have too poem at that.
So the fact that I am talking about is a malesclusive modern of modern modern society.
And what it is to depressing and arrabing is this: Steve Levitt talked about yesterday about yesterday and the seats are involved in the basic fibes are us.
I mean, that these choices, complicated and dispending, it's not just that they are just inuseful.
They're addance.
They make it worse worse
If a little bit of what in our societies allows a lot of what people have too much choice was reversed in those where people have too chance, but even now.
This is what economists are called a better paretian.
A red-red-red-red-a-do-not just the poor poor -- not just the poor poor -- because of this choice in the except of it.
And to conclude says, "You can become everything you want, "You can become everything that you want,
You know, people beard, you know, "What does that fishh is what the fishot weight
"It's obvious that you can't get anything in a vetroom in a vetroom of the vety."
"Auth, a cool viewed viewed view."
and I anked it to the pointed like this, at the beginning.
But then, I think that, I realized that that fish, I realized that fish.
Because the reality of the fact is that if you keep in franks, so that "everything is possible" is possible" -- you get the freedom.
If you break the mouse of the mouse that you can become deminue.
You hehear the paralysis, and you reduce the well-being.
Everybody needs a sphere.
This is almost certainly too strected, maybe even for us.
But the absence of some symbolic symbolic symbolic and temple, for the wine.
Thank you very much.
