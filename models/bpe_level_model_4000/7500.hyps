And I went back to the right right now now to show that the calote of the hotter glacial in a few million years of the size of the 48 S. and the size of the 48 percent, which is rerot-year-percent.
But all the subsisizing the gravity of the problem because it is not the right right right now.
The calculation glacial artable is a certain sense, the heart of the climath of the climatical system.
You go and sandp and you get the extent of the estimate of the est.
The next next devices is going to be a very quickly as the last 25 years.
The ice ice ice are dealing in the red remarkable to red.
As you see, you see it down to the blue blue blue blue blue blue
That's the ice ice in the inver, which you get the exestimate of the estimate of the exest.
You can see that the cosident in the hospital or five years or more and it is like the corner of the corner of the corner of the body.
In 25 years is going to go from so so I was going to be like this.
This is a problem because the re-scale problem in the ocean an an an ice ice ice in the ocean an of carbon on of carbon on on the ocean -- they get them into the mixed by the microbe.
And I think of the totality of the inquining atmosphere, which is the global, which is the most of the inqueness of the inqueness of not red.
In some laghi deep in Alaska metal methanboard is already reboaring from water.
The professored Katey Walter of Alaska was with a recrecent with a team of the last last last last last last last last last last last last last last inver.
Vide: Wow! At Gor: Life is going to be well. The question is if we will be well.
A reason is that this scale environmental scale by the Groenllying from the normal north.
This is a folume glacial phry.
And the ported never reached to reach in the six.
This is the Kangerlussua's Kangerlussua's souththend,
If you want to know how to get the level of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the hospital and where the mart.
These are increasinging up very quickly.
And in the other part of the planet: Antars, the most block of the planet.
The next next year, the scientists have clearning that bizarm is in negative ative ice is in den, and the Antartical article of the isold and the only only death and the same same same thing.
And it turns out to six feet of the water, like in Gerenles.
Himalaya, the third more than the third more block of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the milaghing and the most most of the colors.
The 40 percent of the world's population of the water water water water water water water water from what to the money.
South Ande: This ice is the founder of the water water water water water water water towards of this city.
The ported is increased.
But when I diminuish, the same happens, the water water water water water water water water water water water water water water water water water water water water water water water water water water water water water water water water water water water water water water water water water water water water water water water water water water water water water water water water water water water water water water water water water water water water water water water water water water water water water
In California never, Nevada is diminute of 40-percent.
The setrices are in crisis.
The previsions, like you know, they're very gravity.
The growing growing world in the world doctors a night of indictions.
The environmental environmental environmental environmental environmental environmental and unprecedents.
And so I have more numbered in the last 30 years of the precedents.
This is a sand--and--and---and--and---and--and---and--and---and--and-and-and--and-and--and--and--and--and--and--and-and--and--and-and--and---and-
If you look at the context of the context that they can see the constants.
In the last five years we added 70 million tons of CO2 -- 25 million tons -- 25 million tons in the oceans every day.
Look at the area of Pacifical Pacifical Amer, from Amer, and on the subjects of the subcontinent parts of the subjectory of the subjectory of the oceans.
The greater is the global warming, with global warming, and the deforestation, which is the use of commondity of comfortable of commoney.
The oil is a problem, and the carbon is lost love,
The United States are one of the most emissions, with the Cina.
And they propondded to build a lot of the carbon on on the carbons.
But we're going to get a change.
These are the projects in the last last last few years and some proposes.
In each way, there is a lott-political lott-
The carbon and the carbon and the oil has been a 250 million dollars in the last year for the last year for the last year for the mixx.
And so I remember me me me something,
Verya, in the Tennesthesped, there was a performance of 3.8 billion feet and carbons.
Maybe you saw the news on the news of the news of the news of the news of the news of the news of the news ars.
This is the second big fluses of scale and in America.
It's happened around Natal.
The teachers a sweaking of a carbon is this:
Vide: Look is a cool of the carbonical is a kind of coals.
It's got to the hond in America, and it turns out our economy.
Frosty the carbonaim is always more pull than that.
It's good to preze, adorable and the work and the work work are going to get the depend.
At Gor: The model of the West Virginia.
The most big society is Mashian is Massey Coal. This is his friendly with friendly mothers. This is his friendly
Vide: Don Bllenship: Sarm -- Al Gore -- Al Gore Reid Reid Reid Reid -- not not talk about what they're talking about.
At Gor: So the Alleance for the Clim of Clim Clian has two page.
This is a kind of essentially a party.
Vide: Aror COOALergic will see the translate changes like a very few depending in our business.
So our priority is to investment a big amount of money in a sforce of money in a sforce to make it it and conconstruction on the carbonon.
In fact, the carbon is not spore.
We think it's a good -- it also has a good buon profume.
So not preocumulated.
Let me do it.
Vide: Attan: Carbone -- you heard of a lot of it.
So we love a structure structure in a structure of the carbon on on the carbon on on the carbon on it.
Straordinary machines are a little brug and this is the sum of the carbon of the carbon of the carbon of the carbon of the carbon the mountaines.
The carbon is between carbon is between the global warming the global warming, but the night, but the night of the carbon is going to see that it is going to see that change.
Dake a eye eye is the odierent of the carbon is the carbon of the carbon on it.
At Gor: Infine, the alternative is connetwork and the economic deal and the economic insudden.
Vide: The ment: The economy, the economy, the economy, the economy, the economy, the economy, the economic crisis.
The movie that the connection of the dependence from the comfortable of the comfortable of the coal and oil oil oil oil oil oil oil oil oil oil oil oil oil oil oil oil oil oil
Now, we lost a new solution, and audace for ushing it.
Think of energy energy in the energy of energy in the 10 years.
A pipieces to get the work to work and make us more physically physically really, and helping the global warming.
Finally, a solution that basts our problems.
You know, America. Scooker is going to get more than it.
At Gor: This is the ultimate ultim.
Vide: He is the ment: It's about reeating energy in America.
One of the most more than the most fastest to the end of the commoney.
Comparsa: The future is here.
He knows you know 2: Nuoves for places for places for a lot of work for a retribites.
He said, "You're going to be realistic reception.
At Gor: A old properties or they said, "If you want to go back to the sleep, you get to solve it.
If you want to go back and go back together.
We have to go back to the very quickly fast ast and fast ast ast we have to go back to the very quickly.
Thank you very much.
The last year at TED I had a introduction on the LHC.
And they promit of reaching you to get to to you like it to how it works.
So I mean, the other time for the other time you don't have no longer -- the most most most experimental experiment, the most most experimental of the conference of the conference.
He's reaction is of reaction that were expresent that were expresent of a billion of a second from the beginning of the beginning of the beginning of the second at the beginning of the second of the second of the second of the universe in the beginning of a second of a second of reaccounting.
All of it is just the environmental environment.
This is the machine ine machine ine ine machine ine ine ine machine is the machines.
We use these minmin-Big Bang in the rise in the rise of the rise of the rise of the rise of the minmin-Big Bang Bang Bang Bang in the rise of the mind.
This is what I work working. It's called AS -- is cut, 44 feet and has a diameteter than 222-feet.
This is a picture of ATLAS in PLAS in building so you can see the proportions.
The 10 of the last last year we have acceso acceso for the first time.
And this picture was taken from ATLAD.
It was because of immen, they were festing in the site of control.
It's an image of the first fasking particles that had done all the around the LHC, in the HC, and it turns out of the HC, and it turns out out out of the LHC, and it in the re---hold on the round in the rise of the LHC, and it has done all the
In other part, when you see the 10 sector, we understand that the machine that the machine is a great live, which is a great lived vity vity in the great lives.
I don't know if it was going to make us more oppose, when somebody went on Google and I lived it was this:
What we had a impact impact on the scientific impact of what scientific scientific --
And it is a week week later, it was a problem with the machines, you know, this movie here -- these films here -- these films are a little bit of the carding.
These movies are 13,000 feet when the machine is going to be the massive of the potential with the potential of the potential we could get 13,000 3,000 feet of the potential to the massive mountail of the pot.
Now, the technical technical of you look at the movies and they are the filming.
And instead they can do it because they get the cosident cosident to the super-conductors.
So, at least 271 grade temperature to a temperature in the space, these films can bring that in the spaces can bring that that chood.
In one of the most of the most of the most of the Mr. there was a difinger in the HC, there was a fabrication.
So the movies you can read it it up a few 3,000 miles les of the suddenly resistence to meet a resistence electrical resistence electrical ical resistence electrical ical resistence and 13,000 feet to get a resistence of the ground und.
This was the result.
Now, this is still more impressive impressive if you think that these magnetic grounds more than 20 tons of about 30 centimetries.
They are danneled about 50 magnets.
We had to get them up, what we did we do it.
We have repristiced and fings.
Now, they're going to get all the right right to their place in the street
And the end of the marage LHC will be a new inte.
We accend, and we think of the data to get the data to get the right or him, and continue so we get the universe.
Now, of course, in a certain point in the mother, these argument reaches the debate of the science and engineering the engineering of science and engineering from constant. It's easy to confute.
I think the fact that the fact that it is so difficult to go and the value, I think this is the value, I think it's the value,
I want to conclude with the parts of a scientist of a scientist Humphre's parts of the inuseful of the inuseful experiments of his pull, his pulliant and the pulliant of the same phres, which is the very dangerous of human replace, which is the very very much as the science of the ideas that doesn't not be the science of the remarkable of our ideas that people who are not not not not not not not not not that that that we don't have to be the defffffffasasking the same same ideas that the same ideas that that the dededeffflights of the rely rely as the exexexexexexexexexexexexexist of the same rely as a a a a a a a a a a a a
Thank you.
I want to start asking to rethink about how to get to me to get the morning.
And then you understand how to reach them and it turns out and they learn them and they learn and get them and solved them and solved and solved and so they solve the relationship.
The reason is to prove is to connect to connect the way we understand great part of the world around us.
So, by inforce inforce from useful of our interaction with the interaction of the interaction of my conversation with my collaborative Pac, and my collaborative construction of our interaction of the souse of the smark of the smark of the smark of the instrument of the smark that you can be a little bit of the remarkable information with a little bit of the information with the sand-h-h---scutututututututut,
and systems our addating system?
The question was so interesting that I decided to explore the answer, building the answer, building the answer, building Siftable.
In fact, a lot of the Siftable is a computer interategy as a biquote as a biquote biquote as a biquote computer.
In fact, a lot of the Siftable is a computer interategy as a biquote as a biquote biquote as a biquote computer.
You can move with the hand the hand they can see it in the hand they feel the movement and a radio and a radio wireless and a radio wireless and a radio wireless and a radio wireless and a radio wireless and they can move with the hand they can move with the hand they can move with the hand a radio wireless to the hand a radio wirelevant and a radio wireless.
But the most course are objects like the morning, as the morning, you can move to just just just flowing it as well.
Siftable is an example of a new tools to make the information for a digital tools to the information information information
And then they become more physics, they were going to be the moved of the move, and they are more physically worried more physics, and they were more physically really, of the movements of other, as they can exploring new and different and different and functions.
I'm going to start with some simple example.
This Siftable is configured to show of the vide: if you get it in a direction, the video video video video video video video video video video video video video from the other part of the other part of the other part of the other part of the other huse.
These are concern interactive activity are conscience.
If they are interested in the course of them are interested in what is their own intenterd.
If they get it and they can save it and they can agree a little bit of it.
If they get it and they can save it and they can agree a little bit of it.
They also have their movement.
And then we realized that one of the interaction of the interaction was the interaction of the interaction of the interaction of the interaction of how it was a fliquid.
In this case, we have three Siftable as they wrote as a smart and I can use them to be able to the middle of the color in the middle, where they missing them.
and I can use them to be able to the color where they put them up.
If we are so going to get a little bit like this.
I'm also very good and possibilities, as the languages, as the languages and games of the local of the local things like the results of the things that are going to look at the results of the results of the same thing that they can try and see it as the immediately and see it as the lights of the local of the logical aping and see the things that they can
Now I'm --
This is a sequence of Fibonaces that I do with a program,
So we have a game of Scarabeo and Bogge.
Pratically, in every turning of the Siftable, Prate, Prate, Prate, Prate, Prate, Prate, Prate, Prate, and as a literal factors of comporate in a place on a facturing of the compounds of the compounds of the Siftable, Pratrate.
And then after about 30 seconds of you remix, and you have a new new kind of trying to try and new possibilities.
Thank you.
Here's what they came up in the game in the Middle Lab, I did it and I made it and I took a video.
They like a lot of it.
And one of the interesting things of this gene is that you don't have to give people many instruments.
You just just say, "Compypes of paraa," and they know exactly what do they do.
Here's another other people who try it.
This is our kills younger young people in the dealing up in the degree.
And it was just just going to be a cut.
They just get only morning.
Now, this is an appreciation of a careful activity.
We wanted to build a tool--instrument tools is Flix. He is Flix.
It can be able to make new personal personal in the right right right now.
It can be able to make new personal personal in the right right right now.
And that's doing it out the money out.
Vide: The sole is sorsorts of it.
David Merrill: Now it has taken a treatment in the scale.
Video: The treatment is going to be arrying it.
Bel work no! Y! Y!
So Sife Siftable and you put it and you can interact the personal can interact the personal persons
Vide: Bau!
And it inventing their story.
Vide: Ho!
DM: It's a story with final final insection and it can decide he wanted to be like you --
DM: It's a story with final final insection and it can decide he wanted to be like you --
Volololol: The viging.
DM: The last example I have the time to show you is a tool, I did a recent of recently, to be a music and exeguing music.
It's a ment, I realized of recently, to the music and exeguing and exeguing and exeguing music.
Siftable here are acting by sum like the bacteria.
Every one of these has four different different variations, and you can save you to use it.
You can insert these sues in a sequence of comporate with your lifeed to your life.
And it just just just making a round like a sound "You know, and a "Rus."
These are actually you can control from the live, like the reveral and the film.
You attachaches to a particularly and then then you can get it.
And then there are the general as long and like time and you want to be able to the interest sequence.
Let's look like this.
Vide: The Sife we will put a finger in two Sife and main--sequences, we add in a series, we add other based on the other general expensive other based on the other general constant.
Now I now now have a bass.
Vide: I'm adadd to add the other percent --
Vide: And now I'll put the bacterial filtrum to the bacteria, so I can control the effect of the living in the living here.
Vide: I can speak to the whole sequence of the entire sequence of the time from a hand the other other hand the other other hand from the other hand the same way from the other side of the same time from a stream.
Vide: And now I add it to add the right right to give the most expression.
Vide: I can reduce the sequence of the sequence of the sequence of the sequence of the sequence of the sequence of the sequence of the sequence of the sequence of the sequence of the sequence of "W:
So I don't have a folded planning the first longer or more or more or more or more correct or more correct or more coral.
And so, I can sfuel the entire sequence of the making Sifty is the Sift."
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is build new new interfactory is building new new interfaces as a workers and correcent the brain and corner and correcting.
And today, I had time to show you one of the results of this lost and some possibility that I try out of the lab of the lab of the lab of the lab of the lab of the lab of this lost of the results that I can get out of the lights of this lost one of the results of this lost of this local lab.
The concept I want to put is that this new generation of objects of objects to design with the digital projects with the digital development of the development in our world that we want to do.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the now of talk to all of you.
I'm a written a written to me.
And I want to take books is my professional exsion of course,
It's also the amor and the one of my life.
And I don't expect that it can change.
And he said that, something particularly happened in my life and my life and my career and I got me to realibrate the whole whole relationships with this work.
The particular thing is I was recently written this biography called "Mangia, Prega, Prega, Prega, Prege, Ama" -- and I was a big money.
And the result is that everyone that you go out of the treatment of the treatment of the treated.
But the real -- condition -- condanning h!
They get all the right now I get all worried and say, "You don't have a more to do it not going to do it more to do it?
You don't have a paper of continue to write to write a book that can be able to create a book that can you have to make a book that can you have to write any?"
What can you do to someone in anybody?"
It's rassical, you know it.
But it could go worst in the worst of the most of 20 years ago, when I started to say to say to people -- I wanted to be a true written to be a true written a tricky tricky -- I wanted to be a true of what I wanted to be a true of 20 years ago, when I was going to be a true of the most of the most of the people -- I was a true of 20 years ago,
I went to the same reaction from the country.
And people say, "Who would not have to be success?
You don't have a million refinging of reduction of the refing?
You don't have a paper of the whole life without all life without any life without any life that they never come out and it out of a heart of any infrank with the bock of the band you get the band s?"
You know, you know it.
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is ""Yes."
And I have pay of all of the things.
I always had paper.
And I also have a lot of other things that people can't have to inate.
As the treat and other things like this.
But what I was going to write what I was going to write me and I asked me to me me me so much be?
Is it it it rais?
It's the local that anybody to wait to be sheded by a work that you can get to do.
But what there is so particularly in the improve to make it to get to the site of the site that other carried in a way that other carries to not fing?
And as my father, for example, he was a engineering and I don't remember a only only only only in the 40 years of activity where they asked if they asked if they asked them if they asked the engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineering to be engineering to be engineer to be engineering as if they asked it it was a propertiate to be engineering as as they asked if they asked it if they asked the paper?
It was never -- that block of engineers like that?
It wasn't working.
Onestly, the engineers like group like group like group group like a group of several sed, address of being treated the reputting reputation of being treatment to be treating.
We written enough to this reducation, and not only a writers but I think of any general, we have this reputation of being enormously reputting them of being enormously representation of being enormous reputting them as a huge reputting reputting of all of any generation, and not only a very very much of all generation.
And it is not going to look at the trister of the magnificent of the magnificent of the magnificent -- only in the 1th century, and often often for their own and often often for their own and often for their own and often for their own and often often to get the other death of the magnetic dedeath of the magnitude of the magnificent tristics.
And the ones that you are not suician data like to be really, they were actually discover their women.
And Norman Mailer, before I was going to be in the last view of my book said, "I was a very little bit more extraordinary of the work of the work of the work of their lives of their lives of their lives of their lives in the last grab of their own life.
But we don't get the hand when we heard these things like this so much long-time that in some way we have completely interiated the notion that creative is the notion that creative creative and the notion of the things that you can get to the argument of the right right now.
And the question I want to all of what I want to all this ide?
And it is good to look at the word from a centimer from a centimer to me not good for anything that we can be not be good for this constitution.
I think it's odiose.
And I think it's also dangerous, I want to see the next century.
I think it's better to incouraging our great minds and I think it's going to be true.
And they said, in my case in my case -- in my case -- it would be very dangerous to start out of that I was going to be danging the constitute, and then I have my careful red.
Of -- I look at it, I am pretty young another, I have about 40 years.
I still have about four decade of work in me.
And it's very likely to write that everything I write it will be right right now now now now now now after the the work of my last book.
I'm going to be slavery, because we all have -- it's likely the most successful thing that my greatest happened to my spall.
Oh, Ges: What would would think it is.
You know this is the gene of thinking that he has a person to start to start to starting to start to the nose and I don't want to do it.
I would continue to continue this work we do.
So, the question is what does it happen?
And so I would sever, after a lot of reflects to work for continue to write it is to write a costructure of a costructure of protent, right?
I wanted to find a distance of physically security between me, which I'm writing and my mind, and my mind, and my mind, and I wrote a little bit of the last year models and then I was looking through the time, and I started looking through the time, and I want to find a lot of the monkey and more and more more than the most people and more and more healthy and more healthy and more than the better and and and the most people and and close and I was written out of what reaccount
and how to help people believe that they create the inerate reefs of creative creative action of creative creative lives.
And that research has been taken to the antic and antom Rom and antic.
And then you get because it in the circle and then it goes back back back again.
Nellellow Greee and antic Roma -- people didn't look at that the creative creative creative that creative creative to the manughts in the human initizens and the creative Greews and the creative and and antic.
It was thought that the creative that creative was this spirit and they come to the manuupon man's manages from a few people and know for reasons, for reasons, for reasons, for reasoning and the unknown as as as as as as as as as as as as as a correlative to the grounds and they know that they are the because, and they know that they are the flower and unknown of the distinguished and they are the bed,
The grew of these divent dives, the creative of creative creative creative creative of creative creative and "demoney.
Socrate, wonderful that he was a demone that you had a demelelargic sages from the mountail.
The Romans were the same idea, but they were called the the wrote of the spirit of the same ideas.
The big thing is great, because the Romans didn't think that a kind of like a particular kind of unusual gene --
They believed that a gene of this species of entity in the wine that they were literally in the last study of the study of a little bit like the else, a little like the wish and the work of the arm of the article of the article and modeling the results of that work of the article of that work work of the article of the argument of the enjob of the arm of the arm of the enbe, and a little bit like the whole
And I just sat -- -- that is the distance of which is the distance of what the costruction that costructure and results of your work.
And all of them were so that it was so that it work?
So the artists were protting, as a certain thing, like for the drug too narcives, right?
If your work was exceptional work and all the mer, all of the mer, all of the mer, all of the geniiid.
If your work fail, it wasn't all colord, right?
Everybody knew that it was your genive to be a inable inable inable to be a inable inable to be a inable inable to be a inable inable to be a inable inable to be a inable inable to be a inable inable to be a inable inable to be a gene to be a inable inable gene to be a inable to be a inable inable to it.
And so people han concept, the creative creative in Occident for a long time.
And then the Rince came and all of it, and it turns out this great ideas. We can be the big ideas.
This was the principle of human beings, and people start thinking that creative creative creative to think that the creative creative of the hydrodrops.
And for the first time in history, you know, I think about this or that arts or that arts of a kind of like a genie.
And I have to tell you that was a big thing.
I think I lose to someone -- a simple person to make it as a recient recient as the foundly of all the same parts of all the same kind of death and unknown is a responsibility to the fragile of the big huses that human.
It's like to ask someone to do the money to do the solar sold.
I was completely the whole eep and I think of all these ingestiable to be able to expect on the loperformance.
And I think it was this pression to get the artists in the past-old artists in the past.
And if this is true, and I think I do it -- and I think it is and that?
We can do it different place?
And then you go back to a more antic understanding of the relationship between humans and I was creative and creative to it.
Or maybe they are not.
Maybe we can't get 500 years of thinking about 500 years of thinking about 12 minutes.
And there is people between the audience that sound would be legitical requires on the scientific of the scientific needed to the next of the people who following the next of the next to their project.
I'm going to not going to be going to be all on this thing.
But the question I would like to do is -- why do you do it because you would like this?
Why don't think about it in this way?
Because it has more than any other thing that has ever heard about experperforming the experperforming of the process of creative process.
So a process that as anybody who never tried to do something -- so much fundamentally all of here, you don't behavioral behavior.
And they can be completely paranorormal.
I did this insum with the extraordinary Ruth Stone, which has now been a few years but it was a few years and he said, but it was a little bit of the life and he said, it was working in the range of the hand it it out of the hand it was a little bit of the husbed by the hed by the hand it was a little bit of the hand the land.
He said, "He was like a fragorous fragory of the air.
And he was so rotating to her from from from the country.
And he felt it comes to the earth under the Earth--up on the Earth's hand it it goes down the Earth---raise to it up the planet under the earth-hold hand it it it turns out the earth of the Earth--raise to it.
You know, it was one thing to do to do that point and it was words like a morning, "You know, a morning, "You know, in a morning.
And so it goes to the house and it was going to get it from this little bit of a piece of car, and it would not have to take a piece of careful and a fold, founded the train and the training of the paint.
Sometimes it wasn't going to be enough to be enough to be and correct and correct it without going to get into the house and the rotoled and she would continued to the rotoled and she would continued to the through the country, and he would continue to come through the country, and she said, "other poet."
And then there were the time -- this piece of not going to be -- there were the time in which was almost even even even though it was almost lost lost of the time that was almost lost the time that was almost lost of the time that was almost lost of the time that was almost lost of the time.
So, he was going to go and he was trying to the car, and he was going to go through the hand it was just just just in the while he was going to go and then he said, "He was like if it was like if it was like to the other hand the off.
And he was office the code from and the code and it it was going to put it on the page.
And in these hand the poeth would be presented on the perfect and I attempting, but to the last word to the first word the word of the first word at the first word of the first word of the first word of the first word of the first word of the first word of the first word of the folks of the first word of the first word the last word of the first word of the first word to the last little bit of the first word
So when you feel the thought -- is the pathese, is exactly the process of creative process to my process of creative process.
Not all my process -- they're not a constructure.
I'm a folder and my way to work is -- I svehhing up to the same time and you get to work and get to work and get to work and get to the street every day and get to work and get to work and get to work and get it on the same huse.
But even I walk in my head, I got to the model of the things like this, and I wanted to be in the fold.
And I imagine that many of you the han han it.
You know, even if the work and ideas came to a kind of like a kind of like a kind of like I could not get it.
And what is this thing.
And how can we relationships to get it to it in a way to do it it -- what do you do to stay to stay stay to stay to stay sanie?
So as I got to look at the best example that I have is the music I have to the musical musical Tom Waits, the music in a day.
We were talking about this, and you know, and you know, and the most of life was the incarnation of the article of the article of the argument of the argument of the impull of the impull of impull of impull and then I was really interished.
But then you get it up, and you get it on the unding on the uncle of the authode Angeles, changed all for him.
He was going to go and all of a track, this little framat, which is the little framat, which is the inspiring, and it is the issue, and it is the framat, and it is not like to be like to be like to get it.
It doesn't have a piece of car, no long, it has no record.
So I start to hear this species of old old anchance is growing in he he said, "I'm going to lose it for lose that song by this song of the lost of this song lost be.
I didn't have enough and I can't do it and I can't do celel."
And instead of going to go into the pania, you know,
And I went to the whole process and he made something completely new thing.
And he just said, "You know, and he said, "You know, not see what I'm going to come on on your doct?"
"You know, it seems to write a dog or or or or or or or I would write a dog --
If you really want to you, you get a more opported when I can take me when I can take me to me a lot of you.
And I triments, you go to the importance of another today,
And I went to the Leonard Cohen."
And his process of working on the process of doing this.
I don't work was going to be still like it was still going to be right.
But the process, and the fish that was releaving was releaved when he prese the genie, the genide that he was going to be able to be releaving the same problems and I would have to be a whole thing.
but it swed this peculie, wonderful as a conversation of a conversation of Tom and this strange thing to lost that I will not be Tom.
So how I was the story that the story that you can actually change a little way I was working and I was going to be a time.
This idea, I was writing when I was writing when I was writing and the Amama," and the scade of those cave of the disperation that we are working on something and we all see and we can start thinking that is going to think of a disaste, which is going to be a worst worth worth of the worth of the wild --
not only good good at the worst worth book I written before.
And I started to think of this project.
But then I remember the Tom I talk to the airplane and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and
So I put my face, and I would say, I get my factory and I would say, my comfortable to a angle of the room.
And he said, "You know, you know, "You know that if we know that if this book is not going to be brilliant not going to be unlike.
Because as I see it is to put all of what hand, I don't have more than that.
So if you want to get it is better to presenting your parts.
Okay. But if you don't know what I know is not the free of free.
I'm going to write it because it's my work.
And I'd like to be recorded to me that I was going to do my part, because I was presented to the end of the North Africa -- the end of Africa -- sees in the North Africa in the North Africa and music for the long of the long and music, and music and music that they were going to go to the treatment and the treatment that they were going to the tree.
And they were always folerated because the ballers were professional professional and really really really big and fantastic were great.
But every one of these guys, and you know, something happens, and one of these artists became actually actually actually translate in transform.
And I know what you know about it, because I know you have seen seen a point of it, a lost point of it, a lost point of it.
It was like if the time you stopped up through a kind of car, and it was not doing anything of different species of portal mother, as the only one of the solar of the only one of the money --
And in sudden, it doesn't want to be like a human being.
But you accinese from the death and under the outside of dives.
And when this next next to the time and you know, people know what they were going to call it with his nobody was called the not.
They were the honed and start starting to cant, "Allah, DDDD: The Look, D: God."
That's what I'm going to do.
And it was the untable of the Spage, when the Mororest Spage, they were the sand-raining and the gotal in the several ses of the Spaper, and he said, "Lah in the coral correct in the corner or in the coral coral coral coral coral coral coramend, they were the wall the coramend,
In Spay, when a article has done something impossible and magic and magic -- "Allah, magnetic article -- a magnificent of God.
And it's greatly because we have to have to have to be done.
But the problem comes the day later, for the baller's waller's wrote and he saw it and he turns out that they are the 11-in the Marted's wer's nothing.
It's just a dead with a big deal with a big deal with a big deal to the most people never could get the most to the treat.
And maybe nobody can, the name of Dod still and what do is to do with the rest of his live?
It's difficult to it.
This is one of the most ssent of the most paper in a life creative life in a life creative life in a creative lives.
But maybe it has to be so angoal if you can be so unbelieved and not credance, which the most extraordinary of your own extraordinary to be so much of your own own own own it.
But I think I'm going to get out of the data from a inherable ininherable to this team of your life that they have to get a little bit when you have to finish you when you have finally finally finding you have to get it in the rest of the life of your life that they have to get into the life of your life that they have to get into the life of your life that they are in
And you know, if we think in this way to change it.
And so I started thinking about it, and it's sure as I said, "Those I thought for different months in the work of the book that was the audience, the period that was a very successful little bit of my greatest fairly fairly folded of my greatest fold.
And what I have to continue me when I sent me when I sent me to this is, I don't have pay.
I don't have to just your work.
You can get to presenting it for your parts, any one can be it.
If your work is ball, balls --
If the divest, I could put the gene of the assigned and left, for a few kind of wonderful like this, for a very time through the ture, then "Oh, then yeah, y!"
And I triments, I got the same your dance.
And "Oh, y!"
I think I think I think I don't think I want to teach it.
"Oh, yeah, even only for the hand it just had a friend and heads the talks to get to dealing it to really, really, really, just to continually continuously to get it to continue to get it to continue it up to get it to get it to get it to get it to get it up to the hand they get it up to get it up up up to the re
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
And as you know I had talked about some of these projects on the genome of humans and discovered on the genome of new genes.
Now we're starting a new performan: We started digital biologist and now now now to the biologists and now we're going to come into a new fasking and ssinting and sinting and sthizing life.
We always have to get great questions.
"What's the lives of biological biological sues I think that many biological biological lives.
We have trying different approach, reducing process.
We're digitalizing by almost 20 years oritizing for almost 20 years old.
When we have sequence the genome of the world from the world of the biological world of the biologist world of the computer.
Now we can regenerate it up the life of this digital life from this universe to this digital universe
This is the map of a little organisms, the Mycoasm Mycoasm of the genome species of the genome of the little organisms that can be able to the lab in the lab of the genome of the genome of a little organisms, which is the kind of the genome of the genome of the genome of a little organism
And we try to try to reduce the genome of a little bit of a little bit more smaller than that.
We are able to liminate a hundreds of genes of the genes of about 500 of the kind of of of the genes of the genes of the genes of the genes of the genes of the genes of the genes of the genes of the genes of the genes of the genes of genes of the genes of the genes of the genes of the genes of the
But when we look at his map map to his map is relative to the noise of the noce.
I think it's simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can be a very impossible to the time, is very impossible to get a cellurage that can bring a cellual celluual celluraging the limind, a whole genes that we can get a fly as a genes that we can get to the genes of the genes that we can get a cell gen
So we decided that the only only only to progression to progree this chromosomes to get this romosomes to the components to get the functional questions for some of these questions to some of these questions to get the functional questions.
And so we started the leaving of the "Can we can setizing a chair?"
And he can you get the chimical of these great molecular molecular that we do never do the first of the or?
And in case of it, we can do a cook?
A covery is just a piece of material material to the ineral ineral.
The speed that we are able to digital digital life is growing the increasing of the exponential life is growing to the exponential life is growing the very very much growing life and we can be able to the very much growing life to the very very much growing life and we can be able to digital the life of the use.
Our ability to write the code of genetic and degrees like this.
And our most recently recently results of a curve current remarkable to exponential current a current removed to the most recently results of the most recently results of the most recently results to a curve current real.
We started more than 15 years ago.
The process has asked a lot of the passion and start with a bioetic revision before we start the first experiments.
But we found that sintetizing the DNA is very difficult to be very difficult to be very difficult to be very difficult to be very difficult to be very difficult to be very difficult to be very difficult to be very difficult to be very difficult to be very difficult to be very difficult to be very difficult to be very difficil.
There are decade of thousands of machines in the world that produces of DNA, the long of the long long as a deservices of 350 boundly is the long gain, more likely ely to be the long go, more or the sege, more than 30 of the sege, the most undable of the machines of the segment that
So we had to develop a new metal new metal and corner of these framates and correct the errors.
And this was our first trying to our first trying to the digital of Phi 174.
It's a little virus that kills kills
We have designed the correction of the revoltion of the revoltion of the errors and get a lot of about 5,000 literally.
The interesting is when we took this piece of material material to the bacterial and we put it in the bacterium and then they started to read this genetic code and to prove this genetic photes.
The particles were then releaved by the phone, you get back from the cells, and they distruct the Ecoure.
I talked about the recent with membrings of the industry was saying to their model that they have certainly concerned this model.
They have more than you.
We think this is a situation where the software really can build the same way to build the same system.
But we wanted to do the most in greatest big.
We wanted to build the whole romosome.
They're more than 580 miles of code code of code code of code
So we have thought of build it in the cassasses, so we can change the kind of virus, so it can change the casses, so the components of a cellual cells of a vivision.
The projection is crucial real, and if we start with information in a computer, these have to be very accurate accurate it.
When we sequence this genome for the first time in 1995 the accurator accurator for every 10 miles.
We discovered, 30-consequence sequence -- when we were used that we were going to be not able to do not be able to do it work.
A part of the process of designers that we were able to get the 50 boundness, they all have the other segment of 50 boundance of 50 laby that they work together.
We are the elements of the unexact here.
You probably have a laughting that we insert the fol.
Think of this thing, we have a genetic based on four literally on four literally make, G.
And they wish the lended together to the 20 friends about 20 friends, and there's a specific refice of the walls for every friends.
So we can use the genetic to write the genetic to write words, I think of the same thoughts of it.
What we did we do to the beginning was authographic to do it.
Some were very delususes from the fact that it was not poeting.
We have designed these segment for a few minutes of the segment with miles.
They are income and they reparents. They put them and put them and they put them and they put them and they put them and they put them and they put them and they put them and they reparents.
And we started to start to start with the segment with five to mile with five to mile the literally reaches in order to form the slead to the labs of 24 mile and they get to 72 to the literally the literally reach 72 mile and they get to 72 to refftle, and they start with the segment of 24
And we have produced these segment in the street so they are trying to try to try to create a proception of a proception -- as you see a very good -- as you see in a minute.
We're trying to automatic the process.
So, it seems the tabellow of a hush of a flower of a scale of a scale of a habellow of a habellow of a habellow of a habellow of a habellow of a fabellow habellow of a habellow hhabellow a cabellow of a habell
When we get to these segment segment in the most of 100 miles, more directly in E.
You get to the limb of modern the modern tools of biology molecular molecular molecular molecular tools.
So we have a other multimatter.
We know one of another mang called recombination reducation called reducation reducation to reparate the DNA to reparate the DNA in the same DNA in the segments.
Here's a example.
This organisms, called Deinococcus radiation.
You can see in the ridanger as his tails swim to come up up the instrument.
In 12 -- 24 hours is reassembled exactly as it was the first first was the first of the first of it.
They are able thousands of organisms that are able to do it.
These organisms can sell it fairly beat.
They can live under the light.
They're absolutely so much that life in space, and you know, and you can find new environmental environments to find new environmental environmental environments.
And I mean, the NASA has shown this that he was showed that this live.
This is a molecules of the molecular approaching these process.
The liver, you get them out of it.
This picture was not been taken with a microscope with a microscope with a microscope with a microscope rule.
It's a molecules that we can see the great that we can see it with a microscope with a microscope law.
These are a picture that they cooking a time of about six seconds.
This is the advertities we have done a little time ago.
They're more than 58,000 lyellow of code code of code
It's the most big of a lot of a structure of a construcstructure of man.
He's a lot of sangerous souse 300 million res.
If we stamp it with a career or a careful of the only 10 pages of the only one 42 pages of the genetic pay of the genetic cars.
Now, how do we do it work? How can we activity this?
Of course, tramed a virus is a little bit of girls.
It's a little bit more complicated when they use the bacteria.
It's more simple when it is a very simple celleucariote as the nostre: you can just just be a nuclear nuclear and inserirs a nice of the clearly of the clear.
In the bacterial bacterial romosomed in the cell phone, but we have recently folded to do a trailing of a trailing romosome, and a mountain another and activity to the other and activity of activity and activity to the romosome.
We have a tailing romosomes to a microbic species of a microbic species of microbic species of a microbic found.
The two different things like the manuface.
We added a few gene and more in the more way to get to this choose to the romound.
And then it has the check with the inchance to get all the protection.
And when we put into the cellual celluraged -- and we can appreciate our graphic graphic phone.
And we were thinking that we were not going to go back and we try to try and we try to try and it more than it is.
This is one of the most multimately evolution.
We found that very much species have added a second or a third romosome, a third romosome, I added up a new new trategy of new trategy of that species.
So who think about evolution as a only gene and when you have no way to understand the big biologists of biologist.
They are the insues of the insues of reductions, which addictional reference is that reduce the DNA.
The romosomes that was in the celluual cells of it.
The pha-the tail bounds we have inserable to the ha.
It's expresent and it has recognized the other cool as as as it as it looks like the romosome, and we are going to be able with only the romobile and the new mountain and the new mountaste.
It's become blue blue because of the genes we have insert.
And in a short lead of time, all the careful of a species of a species are going to go and it turns out of the new software in a new species, and we put it in the phone.
All the protection are changed, membraning is changed, and when we get the genetic code of what we have transferred to what we have transferred to what we have transformed it.
Now, this could look at the genetic software are going to be able to make the software in so so much replace.
Now, I have already explain that you don't talk about the parts of three million years and a new new species of evolution, and a new version of evolution, and I told that maybe we're going to create a new species of the explosion of the explosion of the explosion of this digital process of the digital process.
Why do you do that?
I think it's obvious enough when we think about our need to need to our need to necessary.
We're going to go from six billion and a half a billion people in the next 40 billion the next 40 years.
Just for a example: I got in 194. I went in 194.
Now there are three people on the planet for each one -- in 194, they are going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be there.
We're going to come now now to find out of the free and bins, medicine for six billion people.
It's still more than the most spend a billion billion billion billion billion billion people.
We use more than five billion carbon on of the carbon of the boils of the olid.
That means millions of barils to the day.
When I call it out of biological process, or any kind of process of reflects of the enormous challenging of enormous process.
In the most we have to keep the whole of the all of the CO2 from these materials that you get into the atmosphere.
At the day, because of the scientific World World War we have a data with about 20 million genes, and I like to think of the new parts of designed designed for the future.
The electronic industry is just a dozen of the components, and think of different things are come out of different things are come out of the things are come out of the things are come out of different things are going to be a dozens of the things are going to be a dozens of compony, and they are the fuel of the freedozing.
Our arm here are data from the reality of the reality and our imagination.
We have the technique, because of these metal metothization, in the sinting of what we call genomical genomic genomic combined.
We can make a big robots that can make a million bunch a million mosomes to the day.
Think of these 20 million genes of genes or of different or to try to try to try to try to make it out of the drug or drug -- new vaccines, new team, and create more biologist of the last 20 years of the last 20 years of science, and they can actually make it in the last 20 of the time to make a little bit of the fun of the genes of the genes of these 20 years of the falls of the genes or or or or or or or or or or a little bit of the process.
And it's just a searching searching searching in standard.
We can swim to the possibilities, a production or carbon of carbon and producing production of vaccines --
This is an instantanea few software programmed that we're working on to be able to be able to be able to be able to computer.
Well, we don't know how to be going to be year.
We know exactly what their code code genetic code here.
Now we're going to focus on the carbon of fourth of the fourth of the carbon of the carbon on on the carbon on on the carbon on the carbon on the carbon on the carbon on on the carbon on on the carbon on on the carbon on the carbon on the carbon on on the carbon on carbon on on on carbon on on on the carbon on on on carbon.
You also saw you see that you can see it was a grassical experiment,
We have a second and the second generation that use of the most predent enough to the coal of the most valuable of the most valuable of the most valuable of the most valuable of the fanolded of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most asking and the most fanolder of the most valuable of the most valuable to get a lot of the most valuable to the most valuable of the most valuable to the more than the more than the more than the than the dead of the dead of the dead and the dead of the fff
But the only way that the biologist can have a big impact without increasing more than the food and unusual deal with the most of food and unusual is going to be transforming the first of the first carbon on on the same material that can get this to design this prove for the first carbon on the first carbon on on the same generation of the first generation of the same generation of the generation of the same generation of the millles.
The light light folded with CO2 is a metodom -- but in our discovered in our discovered in the world, we found different metos.
This is a organism that we have debed in 1996.
They live in the ocean to about 2,500 feet of proption to the temperature of the water.
They create from CO2 from CO2 molecular as a molecular of energy.
We're trying to figure out if we can ing the CO2, which can be transported to be transported by the CO2 in carbon -- and conversation in the carbon --
So what we could be able to get to increase what we could be able to increasing: "What is the vita" is Noes,
And if you can't do it from TED, where you can do it from TED, where you can do that?
It would be a main-source of energy.
And we're working on the same way to use the same metal methods to create accines of the ants.
You saw this year with the influence, we are always going back to a year and a year and a year when it is to find the right accine in the right right now.
I think what you can build in accines in anticians.
Here's how the future could start to look at the tree of evolution, the tree of evolution, acceless with bacterial bacterial evolution with bacterial and inally, the end of the euceucariots.
We are so so from the better to get people.
Our final is to do it in order to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try and get a lot of it.
But I will see that you see the most quickly possible, some fundamental fundamental technology that we have to the Microsoft in a watery that is a almost a year of almost a year of a very much of the most functional defflighting to the Microsoft of the functional phone.
It's a very environmental environmental environmental environmental level that remotion with a huge amount of data from data to the visual data from data to data here.
So we're seeing a lot of the great photos with a digital photos with a kind of digital and continue, for a very quickly folder and it turns out how we want to do it.
And not what big is the big amount of information that we see how much of information or things or the great things or the imagines.
Most of the Most and digital for this example is a scansion of the Bible ble ble I, and reenter in the Bible of Congress, and then 300 miles of 300 miles of 300 miles in the game.
You don't have a difference because the only thing that are the prestation of a system of a system of a system of platel on your screening in any moment. It's also an architecture, very flically.
This is a book of data not image, as I don't imagine it.
This is Casa desolated of Dickens. Every very colonna representing a capital capital.
For you show you that this is just to show you a very well as a thing of the general thing of the general representation of the head, not a fot.
It could be a little artificial way to read a little bit like a book electrical book.
You don't have to get it.
This is a more realistic example of a number of of a number of of ULook at at the most realistic.
Every big is the beginning of a several sed.
And it will be the finging and the beautiful experience of read the version of the version of a review of a quote of a quote of a molecules of a molecules of a lot of of a lot of of it.
We also have done something with the angle of this number in particularly in particularly at the angle of this number of this number of this number of this number of this number of this number of this number in particularly in particularly in particular.
We have a publicity to get a higher resolution -- much more than that you use in a normal respect -- and you have insered the context of the context context -- and you have insered the context of the context -- much more than the context of the context reresolution of the context -- and you have to be a normal rererevegetity to be able to the contexity
If you want to see the careful of this automobile, you can see here.
Or other models, or even the specific activity that specific needed the specific of it.
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space,
We lost that glass to put it and then then I get to the other porcheries and a million being necessarily to be able to be able to be able to be able to be argue to be argument to be able to be able to be able to be argue to get it and other porchants.
Of course, the map is one of the most of technologies.
And I don't want to go time, if we don't want to say that we have the contributed to give it it it in this field.
These are all the streets in the United States in the United States a picture of the NASA.
So now we're going to go out something.
This now is actually actually from the webs; you can go it up to see it.
This is a project called Photonth, which is two different technologies.
One is Seadragon and the other is a very interesting visual computal computer to be a very interesting object, a student of Washington, with the CCity of Steve City and Rick Shelilian Shelizing Shelizes of Microsoft Resear.
And it's from the website on the website,
You can see it when we do this kind of screens, where we can go from a picture of the other and have this kind of experienced to solve the last deal with the last flights of experiences.
But the collection of spacection of the images here has actually a meaningful meanings.
The algoritorits, the computer have recorded these images together, so that you can see the places that you can be the road -- all the road of the taghi Grash and the Bash Roccurrasking -- you see the Roccurring of the deal deal with a de-re-re-re-re-re-re-re-re-re-re-re-re-re-scale of the things are going to be a fly and the spacececececk and the spaceck of the spaceck of the spaceck of the scale of the the the scale of the scale of the facacacacacacacac
I don't know if I have time to show you some other environment.
And I'm some more space.
I want to go to the right one of the original data from Noahhand, this prototypes of Photonthynthic that we did it for the first time you can work for the first time you have done -- to show you what the time is really really the time that we really don't don't need to be the technology. And it doesn't really really really really really really really really really really, the environmental technology.
We had to get worry about the legal and I say that you are going to be able to get out.
This is a rebuild the cattaching of the Dame Dame Dame Dame images from Flicky Dame Basta digital type of the Dame of Dame and you get images of these argument of these concers and say, other of these arms of these concers that represents a picture that you see this model.
So they're all images by Flickr and they were all linked to this in this way.
And it's possible to get into this simple way to this simple way to do it.
You know, I would never have thought of what I would never get to work for Microwt.
It's very gratifiction of accompanies here.
I think you can see that it is a lot of different types of falls of those professional phone of the phone of the professional phone of the same with this environment.
And if you can come out out of the most stranother.
Many are block from doctor, etc.

The dogal offical offical offical offical dog?
The dogal offical offical society and the dogal dogal offical official and really, we want to be a similar of our city, and the way to do it is like to do the freedog."
The reason to the right right right now, in fact that the freedom is in the same one value, is preprepretable to human beings.
And in the other is in fact that if we are free, each one of us can active for all of what is a similar of our benefit to name in nobody who decide in nobody who decide in our own own own own it.
The way to mass like to freedom is mass like this.
The more choices people are free, and more free, and the greatest is their freedom, more or is their freedom is their free.
This ritue, is so so to get it in the society that nobody would have to put it in doubbe.
And it's also also reached in our lives.
I'm going to show you some examples of what the progress that the progress that the progress possible.
This is my supermarket. It's not particularly great.
I lost a simple note on the conditional conditional conditional conditional conditional conditional conditional conditional conditional res.
In my supermarket have 175 conditions, without contact the 10 various various of the extrtracets, and the 12 acets, and the 12 acets, you can buy a huge number of constantly constant in the grounded of your degrees of your degrade of your degrade of your dedement.
That's the supermarket.
And then you go to the nor of electronic to buy a stereas a stereas CD, radio -- radiast, radio -- radiast, radiast, radiast, radiast, radiastast, radio --
And in this single single site of electronic electronic components of components of the audience.
We can make six million a different combination of different combinations that there are in a negoties.
You can get that there is a lot of choices but it was a choices.
Some cam: The world of communications.
And again, when I was a kid, they could get all the services, they could get all the services, to be able to the mom of mostly mom Bell.
He was the phone one phone.
One of the final of that, it was that the telephone that the telephone they don't get it to be a cooe.
These are going to go out.
We have a various various various various phone of telephone of the phone of the cells.
Here's the phone of the future.
My favorite is what in a methe, yet MP3, and foreign the nose of the drum is a blue fule.
If you don't even see in the negogod, you're going to be able to get out of the prevent that I'm going to get out.
And what the end is that people enter in the negoties and it does this question you know what the answer? The answer answer is "No."
It's not possible to buy a phone that you can't do it and do it and things like that.
So, in other aspects of life that are very importantly more important, you know, it is the same explosion of choices of choices.
Assistence is not going to be more in the United States that you go from the doctors and the doctors what you get to do.
And I went from the doctor, and the doctor, you could do -- you could do -- you can do it and say, "A has these check and these riskings, "Get you want to do that?"
Tu says, "Dott?"
And the doctor, "A has these benefits and these risches, and they said, these guys and they said, "Well these risk."
"What you want to do you do that?"
And you rebacking "Dotor if she was me, what would do to do that?"
And the doctor: "But I don't have lei."
The result we call it "authonomy of malato," expression that it looks like a beautiful thing.
But it doesn't have a sent that you can get the fish and responsibility of the decisions from somebody who knows something, what you know is the doctor, and almost not know -- and almost almost almost more than the patient of the way to get the patient.
There's a huge markable of products of products to products like me and you know, if you think of it is not a sense, that if you think of not a sense, we can't buy it.
But if we can't buy it, because we can buy it, because they do that?
