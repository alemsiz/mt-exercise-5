I showed these slide of the slide to show that the slide to show that the calculator, which for almost three million years of the artical, which is reverse of 408 United States of 40-percent.
But this subvalue is the gravity of the problem because it doesn't show the ice of the ice problem of the ice problem
The artable calculation is -- in a way, the heart of the global climate system.
You expanding and you get into the summer and you get into the summer of the summ.
The next next few slides will be a quick carrelled sounds of the last 25 years.
The ice lost ice loves are signed in red.
As you see, they get to the blue blue blue box.
That's the ice in inversus in the inversus of the summer.
You can see the ice as you can see the ice as a blood more, is like blood that it was the blood of the body.
In 25 years of that was a past of that way.
This is a problem because the re-scale problem of the ice of the ice of the arttic that are enormous amount of carbon congeled that that money.
I think about the totalality of the atmosphere from global warming, that quantities might double, super-scale.
In some deep lagens in Alaska metane is already rebolling from water.
The professored Katey Walter of the University of Alaska was rected with a team team of the last last last last last last last deal.
Video: Wow! Gor: She is good. The question is if we will be going to be in us.
A reason is that this is that this expactors the Groenland from the north.
This is a glacial pharance.
The laughed that never had reached side.
This is the Kangerlussuaq, in the sounds of the Groenland of Groenland
If you want to know how the spots to the sell of the sea ice of the grounds of the sea.
These are going to be increasingly.
Another part of the planet: Antarctic, the biggest ice of the planet.
The month of the scientists have deployed that the ice of ice is in negative, and that Antartide Western that the Western of some issues on some of the underwater on some of the underwater on the money.
It was six meters of water, like in Groenland as in Groenland
Sull'Himalaya, the third largest block of ice -- they see new laghs, which few years ago, who were ice in the time.
400 percent of the world's population was going to be a little bit of the monkey.
Sulle Ande: This ice is the bottom of the water water of this city.
The laughtered is increased.
But when he diminupon the water water water water water water water water water water water water water water water water water water water water water water water water water water water water water water water water water water water water water water pounds.
In California neve on the Sierra Nevada is 40-percent.
The hydrogen are in crisis.
The previsions, like you read, they are grave.
The growing growing in the world door a nice remarkable growth.
The environmental disastring is going to get a remarkable out of normal and without precedents.
Thaten times more numbers in the last 30 years of the previous ping for 75.
This is a gone of all insustainable.
If you look at the historical context if you can see the consequences.
In the last five years we added 70 million tons.
You look at the areas as the areas of the Pacification from Americh, and the west, and both both both of the subject of the continent of the continent oxygen in the oceans.
The greatest because of global warming, and the global warming, which is the 20, is the use of the fuel of the fuel of the world
The oil is a problem, and the carbon is even worse.
The United States are one of the most hemissions, with the most emissions,
And it was proponent to build a lot of other central carbon.
But we're going to be able to a change of direction.
These are the annulled in the last few years and some alternative proposes.
On every way, there's a political lottta in our country.
The carbon industry and oil have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promoting carbon on on the last year to promote carbon on the last year of the carbon on on the last year of the last year to promote and oil are going to be a bunch of the carbon and oil industry in the last year to promote
That image images me to something,
Vererery in Tennessee, where I lived -- there was a perdity of 3.8 billion pounds of carbon dies.
Maybe you saw it on the news of the news
This is the second largest flower of scrators.
It's happened around Nat.
The advertities of one of the industries was this:
Video: Lrosty the carbon is a kind of hallegrand happy.
It's abundant here in America, and it makes our economy.
Frosty the carbon is always more cleaner is always more cleaner.
It's a good price, adorable and the jobs are going to be the smart of the bad.
Al Gore: Firgain.
The biggest largest society on the mountain is Massey Coal. This is his friend's friend.
Video: Don Bllland, Harry Res: Sarrate -- Al Gore, Nancy Reid -- not know what they're talking about.
Al Gore: So the Alleance for the Clima has launched two campaign.
This is a bunch of bad.
Video: Attor: Attor: ALergives we see the climate changes like a server.
So our priority is to invest a great amount of money in a sforce to make public and consumption.
In fact, carbon is not spore.
We think it's a good thing -- it has a good profumy.
So not pray of climate change here.
Let me do that.
Video: Attor: Carbone pulls -- you heard a lot of it.
So we do this to do a structure of the structure of the sea structure of the carbon be.
Straordinary machines are a little roads of the power of the carbon technology of the power of the power of the carbon technology of carbon --
The carbon is between the main the global warming, but the noevil is the noevil of the carbon --
To a eye -- this is the odiern technology.
Al Gore: Infind, the positive alternative alternative and the most of the national.
Video: He's in America is in the national crisi; the national economy, the national economy, the national crisis.
The filter that the whole whole thing is our dependence from the fuel fuel fuels and oil oil and oil oil and oil oil is important.
Now, there's a new new solutions to use solution for user.
Real America: 1005 percent of clean energy in 10 years.
A plan to report America to work, and make it sure sure to work and help us to stand the global warming.
Finally, a solution that basts to solve our problems.
Real America. Scover more.
Al Gore: This is the last one.
Video: He's reease to America.
One of the fastest ways of going to end, the dependence from the combusters that kills our planet.
Comparsa: The future is here.
They are two two: Noves investment for jobs to work ben retribes.
Comment: Reer America. It's time of being realists.
Al Gore: A old proverbio African old hair, you want to go fast, you go out of the money
If you want to go back to the hand, you go together.
We have to go back to the speak of it.
Thank you very much.
Last year at TED I got a introduction on the LHC.
And I promise to you can get to the way to get you about how the machine.
So I got here. And for the other time I don't have to have any time -- the LHC is the biggest science experiment, the most scientific experiment.
His the way of reacting the conditions that were less than a billion years of the beginning of the beginning of the beginning of the universe -- until 600 million times a second.
All of that is just just the hair.
This is the machine ine ine machine ine ine machine.
We do these min-Big in the relevel.
This is what I work. It's called ATLAS -- is a 44444 meters and has a 222222222.
This is a picture of ATLATLAS in building so you can notice the proportion of the proportions.
The 10 sect secember last year we have accesor the car for the first time.
And this picture was taken by ATLAS.
It was because of immense to the healthy of control.
It's a picture of the first phases that had done all the around the LHC, entering collision, deliberately, with a part of the LHC, and deliberately particles inside the remarkable in the detect detect in the remarkable level.
In other words, when we sell the image the 10 sect sect -- we knew that the machine is a great living.
I don't know if it was to do more than anymore, or if somebody went on Google and saw that the beginning beginning was this:
What it means we had a culture of the cultural impact on the scientific impact of the scientific impact of the cultural impact of the cultural impact on the scientific impact of the cultural impact of the cultural impact of the cultural impact of the scientific impact.
And it takes a week later, there was a problem with the machine, we had to have this philone of these files -- these files dors.
These files are 13,000 prints when the machine is the mouths of the powerful powerful power.
Now, the technical technical technical and they say, "It's not true. I'm filters too underly."
And instead they can do it because when they're very freedom grounds the superconductors.
So, at least 271 degrees to a inference temperature in the stars, these filters can bring that current to the current of the room between the stars, these files can bring that current in the stellow temperature in the stars, and they can bring that current in the stars, these files can take that current in the stelles, these files can bring that current that current in the stells, these filters, these are going to be in the stellow temperature between the stelles,
In one of the boundaries in the LHC, there was a dift of the LHC, there was a dift of the ground.
So the files will be able to read it, and the 13,000 print of suddenly meeting a electricity.
This was the result.
Now, this is even more impressive if you think these magnets, more than 20 tons of 20 tons of 20 tons of 20 tons of 30thries.
They have damamaged about 50 magnets.
We had to take them to the thing that we did it.
We have repristined and the cousted.
Now they're going to go back to their place in the subject place.
English the end of the LHC will be new inteam.
And we expect to the whole thing to get the right data to just, and we can keep the right or him, and we keep the morning that are the morning of the morning that are the universe.
Now, of course, in a certain way, these are reacting the debate on the values of science and engineering the values of science and engineering the values of science and engineer to confuting.
I think the fact that it's so hard to go beyond the fact of the things like LHC.
I want to end with the words of a scientist scientist, Humphrey Davy, the quality, the quality, and the quality, and the main of the inutilize, his pupill, his pupill, "No is the Michael Faraday, "No is a dangerous for the human mind of human mind as the ideas of human mind in nature, which is not mysterias mysteries in nature, and not as myself in nature of new money.
Thank you.
I want to start asking you to rethink about how you get the kids, you play the morning.
While you can reach them how to reach them and make them them and they can actually think about and solve the fact and solve problems and make it resolve problems and make it fairs.
The space is deep is deep to connect to the way we understand the world around us.
So, by informating the inspired of our interaction of our interaction with the physical objects with my Pac, and my collaborator. And I started to say, "And when we use the Jeevanthi, I started to ask him, "And when we use the mouse of the mouse as a digital polymouse as a digital polymmouse to a redrug with the information with both of the redramework with the relliant of the main the main the mainformance of the main with the Pacuriric object of our own physical inery of the inerhood of the ining.
and we get it to our pleasure to our pleasure to our please.
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer, building the answers, building the Siftable.
In a few words, a Siftable computation is a whole whole thing.
In a few words, a Siftable computation is a whole whole thing.
You can move with the hand the hand, they can see the man, they feel the movement and they have a screen and a radio wireless and a radio wireless radio wireless and a radio wireless radio wireless.
But most of course, they're physics, like the morning morning, you can just move on the morning of the morning.
Siftable is the example of a new ecosystems to manipulate the digital information information information technology.
And as they become more physics, they get more physics than others, the others, and others, and they become more physics, and they become more physics, and they get more physics than others, as they are going to explor, we can explorate new and different stiles.
I'm going to start with some simple example.
This Siftable is confifiguring video to show the video of the video direction, if you include it in a direction, the video ruoters out of the other hand,
These interactive ritritual reports are consciously.
If you say that, you are interested in what they do is they are going to be done.
If they get circums, they notice and they can get a little bit of it.
If they get circums, they notice and they can get a little bit of it.
They also have their movements and incluline.
We then realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was the community to be able to use the community of the things like a color like a color like a color, like a color.
In this case, we have three Siftable confifigured as a several several bams and the color in the central color where they missing the color of the color of the color of the color of the color of the color of the color in the middle of the smiles.
and I can use them to switch in the central color where they missed them.
If we are too too many of the we can reach a little bit of it.
I'm also nice to get the possibility of learning, like languages, the mathematics and the logical thing to do things quickly and see the things fast, and see the results of the immediately.
Now I'm going to --
This is a Fibonacy of Fibonaces that I do with a program of equations.
This is a game of words that is half a Scarabeo and Boggle.
On the receive to any saves on every Siftable, Prically, to every turning of the saves of the saving in every Siftable, and while you try to get words about a dictionary.
Then, after about 30 seconds of the remiss and have a new set of letters and new possibility to try and new possibility to try it.
Thank you.
This is what the children came in the Media Lab, I made it in the Media Lab, and I went to a video of it.
They have a lot of it.
And one of the interesting things about this kind of applation is that you don't have to give people many educations.
You just say, "Compons of word," and they know exactly what to do.
Here's how other people that try it.
This is our head young heads young people in there.
It actually wanted to be just to get them.
They were only morning, for him.
Now, this is a whole active carton.
We wanted to build a tool, to the apprint of the lings. It's Felix.
It can be able to save new characters in the scene, sweeping their associated with their associal.
It can be able to save new characters in the scene, sweeping their associated with their associal.
So it's doing the sun.
Video: The only is surging.
David Merrill: Now he took a treator in the scene.
Video: The treat.
Bel work!
So schooling the Siftable and you put the neighbors can interact the characters --
Video: Bau!
and it invention
Video: Ho!
DM: It's a story with the open final of open final final.
DM: It's a story with the open final of open final final.
Video: Golden lives.
DM: The last example I have time to show you is a tool, I realized by recently doing this recently and exeguing music.
It's a tool, I realized recently, to switch and exeguing music.
Siftable here are acting as a low-based sounds and bacteria it.
Every one of these has four different variations, and you can choose what we use to use it.
You can get these sounds in a sequence of comporate sequence.
And it just show it just you touch a sounds "sound."
These are actually that you can control from the reverse and the filter and the filter and the filter.
You attack it to a suit to a suit and then includes to the stand to stay it.
And then there are the general effects like time and volumes, that they can apply the interview.
Let's look at how it works.
Video: DM: We will try to put a basic in two Siftable Siftable sequences, we add in a seriously, we add in a seriously.
Now I put a bunch line.
Video: DM: Now I add percent use --
Video: DM: And I'm going to put the filter to the bacteria, so I can control the effect of the living way.
Video: DM: I can speak the whole sequence on the time from a bunch or from the other.
Video: DM: And I'm going to add the bottom to give more expression.
Video: DM: I can recombined the Reses: DM: DM: DMoes: DM: DM: I can recombined the Res: DM: DMM: DMo: DMM: DM: DM: DM: DM: DMM: DM: DM: DM: DM: DM: I can recombined the Res: DM: DM:
So I didn't have to planned before, but I can suddenly make it longer or more corn.
And now, finally, I can sfue the whole sequence on the left the Siftable to the Siftable "me."
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is to build new interfaces of man-machine is always more like our brains and the body.
And today, I had time to show you one of the results of this lost results.
The concept I want to transmit you have this new generation of objects designed to interact with digital media media media in our world in the way we want.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the time I see with all of you.
I'm a writing writing
I want to be books my profession, but it's more than that, obviously.
It's also love and the phone of my life.
And I don't expect that can change.
But I said to this, something about happened recently in my life and in my life and in my life and in my career and replicate with this work.
The particular thing is that I recently recently wrote this book, this biography called Mangia, Prega, Prega, and the quality, and I was a big big blood of my books, and he became a big big -- and he became a big sailerfe of interaction.
And the result is that everywhere you get people like they were condaming.
It is true -- condanned -- condanned it.
They are they going to be doing all worried and they say, "You don't have to do better than to do better.
You don't get to continue to write for all life without being able to make a book that can importing a book that can importing someone?"
that can matter to somebody hone?"
It's rasking him.
But it could go worse -- I remember that I remember that I was about 20 years ago, when I started to say people -- I was a writing adolescent -- I wanted to be a writing writing a writer.
I would go into the same reaction of the same reaction of the land.
And people say, "Don't you know, I couldn't have success?
You don't have a fear that the refairly killed you kill?
You don't have to do this mestiate for all life without any life that you ever get out and die of a mestimate of snranm to a cumulation of saming the mestimate of the haming of the failure.
Cose of course, you know.
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is: "Yes."
I have a paper.
I always had a land.
And I also have a lot of other things that people might not have to be to be in it.
As the allow and other things she's sending things.
But for what I thought about it and I thought I was and I asked me to ask me to me, is why is it?
Is it rational?
It's logical that anyone who should be spend to be pushed by a work that you feel nice to do.
But what is there is so particularly in the imprese creative to make it nervous to be about the health?
As my father, for example, he was a chemistry, and I don't remember one time in his 40 years of activity where he was asked if he was asked if he was asked if he had been asked if he had been asked to engineer capit?
It was never -- that block of engineer John, how do you wish the engineer
It wasn't going to work.
Onestly, the chemistry engineers like they don't have certainly in the several seasassume of being alcouraged to be alcouraged to depressive depressive depressent you.
We writers, we have enough this reputation and not only writers but creatives of every general generations, we have this reputation of being enormously abless.
And it's not going to look at the southern of the magnificent death of the magnificent century, only in the twentientiention of the century, and often for them.
And the ones that you don't have to be really, they look like to be really, they have to be really, they have to do it.
Norman Mailer, before I die in the last interview said, "On my book has killed me a little bit more. A great business of the work of its lifetime.
But we don't drink when we feel like to say because we have these things so we have these things so we have completely interiored and accepting the notion that creativity and the notion are somehow you wood, and the art, and the hand, and the hangoting.
And the question I want to bring to all of today is you agree with this ideas?
And it's good to do this -- because you can get a centimeter of distance, I don't have to do this supposition.
I think it's odied.
And I think it's also dangerous and I don't want to see the perpetued in the next century.
I think it's better to encourage our great minds creative to live in the big minds.
And because I know that in my case -- in my case -- in my case -- it would be very dangerous to that feeling the same thing that feeling the chicken of the inner inner in my career.
Ovely -- you know, I'm pretty young another, I have about 40 years.
I have about four decades of work in me.
And it's very likely to be able to write that you will be right from the world as the world as the work that he had after the last book.
I'm going to slave, because we are all more or less friends here -- is likely to my greatest successful thing to my switch and my switch.
Oh, Gesood, which think!
You know this is the kind of thinking that brings that door to start to get a ball of the morning and I don't want to do it.
I would just keep doing this work we do.
So, the question is becoming for?
And so I got to seeds, after many reflection that the way to continue to write and write what to create a psychological costructure --
I have a few way to find a distance of safety of safe that I wrote the ansia of which reaction is going to get there, and I was trying to get out of how to do it starts how you begin to look at the time, and I would be looking at the time, and I have more healthy and more healthcare and more healthy and more healthcare and more healthy and more healthcare and more healthy and more and more healthy and I was going to get a lot
about how to help people create the people creative response to the risk of creative creativity.
And that research me led me to the Greek and the ancient Room.
You can see because it's going to be in the circle and then you get back.
In the ancient Greek and Rome -- people didn't seem to be creativity that creativity became in?
And it was thinking that creativity was this spirit of the sea and that they come from a few surprising and smiles, and unknown and unknown to the distant distant and unknown as as well.
The green would call these damages of the creativity of creativity of creativity
Socry, wonderful that he believed to have a demone that electric eld to be smoted.
The Romans were the same idea, but they call that the kind of spirit without a genius.
The thing is great, because the Romans didn't think a genius was a particularly smart genius particularly smart.
They believed that a genius was this sort of a kind of entity that was actually in the study of a artist, a little bit like the arm of a artist, and that he came out of the articket to be hidden of the artical job and the result of that job.
Heptional -- -- -- this is the distance of what I talk about that parts -- that costruct cost that protects you protect the results of your work.
And everyone knew that was so that it works, right?
So the antic artists were proud of circumside, like the too narcis; you know?
If your work was really excited you couldn't take it all the deep you could get all the demer, all knew that he was helped by this genius to help.
If your work fail, it wasn't all cold, it was not all of your work --
Everybody knew that was your genius to be a inable incapable
And so the people han creativity in Occident for a long time.
Then the Resear, and then it change, and it's all about this great idea; we put the human beings in the center of the universe and the mysteries and the mysteries that write the detail of the device.
This was the principle of human twentiential and people started thinking that creativity to think that creativity was completely from the idivide of the slap.
And for the first time in history, you know, you start to reference this artist or that arst genius like a genius rather than a person with a genius.
And I have to tell you, I think it was a big mistake wrong.
I think that allowed to somebody one -- a simple person to believe that a recipe as a recipe as the source and the surprising mysteries and the mysterious mysteries is a very big responsibility to make a very big detech to make a very big detech to make a human responsibility.
It's like to ask somebody to to ingoare to to sun
It degrees all these ingestors, and they create all these ingestiable ingestestors.
And I think it was this pressure to have been destructed the artists in the past.
And, if this is true, and I think the question is it becoming on?
Can we do do it different?
So you get back to a more antic understanding of the relationship between human and and mystery creative mystery.
Or maybe no.
Maybe we can't get 500 years of thinking about the rational thinking about 18 minutes.
And there is people probably in the audience that would be bond suspects about the notion of the notion of the notion of the notion of the nice of the things that they following the next fair.
I probably don't convince you don't know that about this thing.
But the question I want to ask is -- why you know?
Why don't think about it in this way?
Because it has more sense of every other thing that I've ever heard to explaining the exhibition of the process of creative process.
And a process that you ever tried to do something -- so, so, all of this -- so, all here -- you don't behavior.
And, in fact, you can look completely paranormal.
I did this recently recently with the Ruth poeth Ruth Stone, who has now 90 years, but it was a poetrange for all life and said, if he was in his rural, and he was working out in the Virginia, and he was going out in the wide, and he was the landscape.
He said that it was like a fragorous fragorous fragorous phragorous phragorous.
And he was that he was going to stay from the land.
And he was going to get it, because he was going to take the earth under its feet.
He knew we have one thing to do to do that point and it was like, "Which is a morn."
And so it goes to the house and she was going to be followed by this poetry, and he wouldn't have to take another piece of paper and a mand a pretty quickly fair, and then the translate and the roll on the page.
Sometimes you can't be quite fast and it was so fast and correct and correcent and the poem of the poetry rotoling the rotolating through and she was going to stay through the landscape, and he would be able to roll out of the landscape, "Hey, a little bit more more more."
Then there were the time -- this piece of not dimented -- there were times when the time was almost loss that was almost los?
So, she was going to go home and was trying to card and the poem was going to go through the way through the time and he was going to be in the way he was going to be like to ballunged with the other hand the off.
And he was offered the poem of the coda and the remain its body and the translate would be on the page.
And in these cases, the poetry was going to be perfectly on the perfect page, and the other word at the last word at the first word of the last word at the first word at the time.
So when I feel thinking about -- it's a pathese, is exactly the hand, is exactly the fashion the process of creative process.
Not all the creative process -- they're not a conducture!
I'm a mule, and my way of work is going to be able to be on the same orararrary every day and get it over the hair.
But even I did, in my heading heads, I striked up with that cosa, and I was going to you.
And I guess that also many of you have a face.
You know, if I work and the ideas came out of a certain source of them would not be able to be able to be able to be able to do it.
And what is this thing is this thing about what is this thing?
And how can we relate to it in a way to do not lose the head, but plutty, what do we do to do it?
And as I reveally look at the best example I have is the best thing that I have is the musicianeum of the Tom Waits, which I interview.
We were talking about this, and you know, Tom, for the most of life was the incarnation of the article of the argument of the argument of the argue of the impulses creatives of impulses creatives of impulses creatives of the impulses creatives of the around.
But then I invest that, and a day when she was driving on a day when she was driving on a Los Angeles, he changed all for him.
She was going to be going to be going to be a little bit of this little little framtion of melodia, which comes into its head, and it gets into its head, and the wish -- and the wish is wonderful, and the wish, but it doesn't know how to take it.
It doesn't have a piece of care, it doesn't have a matter, it doesn't have a record record
So I started to feel this sort of old anxious anis growing in him and say, "I'm going to lose it, and remarrying the lost of this lost lops.
I don't have enough and I can't do it."
And instead of going to go into the panic stop.
I'm going to do the whole process and he did something completely new.
I'll just look at the sky and said, "You wouldn't see that I'm driving you know?
"Do you look like it can write a song hanson?
If you really want to exist, you get into a more opport, when I can take care of you.
Over the triment, you get somebody else today.
You go to the Leonard Cohen."
And his process worked changed after that.
I don't work was the job, the work was still dark as you get it.
But the process, and the fish of the weight was released when the genius, the genius, genius that was going to get the other problems and the right, and he was going to be a whole thing behind, and he was going to be a whole thing and the skin.
but he knew this peculiar, wonderful bizarre a conversation between Tom and this strange thing and this strange and the outside that was not Tom.
So how the story is what I was going to change a little bit of the way I was working and I got to save me a time.
This idea, I save me when I was writing "Mangia, Prega, and Ama," and and in a one of those disperation where we fall when we all when we all all when we all get to think that it's going to be a desaster, and we can think that a worse book never writed.
Not just good at the worst book book writing.
And I started thinking about the object of the design of this.
But then I remember the Tom I talk about the airly and try it.
So I got my face in the hands from the hands and I would say, and I would say, and I would say a mouththie.
And I said, "You know, what you know if you know if this book is not going to be brilliant not be brilliant to myself?
Because as I see I am going to be able to put all that I don't have that.
So if you want to get a better hour, you have to get you and do your parts.
OK. But if you don't do it, you know, you don't know what it doesn't do about it.
I'm going to go to write the same because it's my work.
And I want to favor that was recorded that I got to do my parte," because -- the end is the end of the North Africa in the desert of Africa in the desert of the Africa of the North people were doubling or long, and and the music and the music and the music that they were going on on and the hand to the hand to the hand and the hebbe.
And they were always magnificent because the ballers were professionals, and they were fantastic.
But every textent, something happened, and one of these artists became actually translate in actually translate in translation.
And I know what I talk about what I talk about it, because I know you have, a lost point, a lost way,
It was like the time you stops and the ballery walk through a kind of doal portal and was not funny of the sun of the sun.
And suddenly not just like a human human way.
But you acceptions from the divince of divinity.
And when this next time this happens, you know, the people knew what he was that he was going to be with his name.
They were the hands and they started to meeting to meeting, "Allah, God Dio, Dio, Dio, Dio, Dio, Dio, Dio, Dio, Dio, Dio, Dio, Dio, Dio,
That's God, you know.
Curious nice -- when the Morders invaser the sodon of the Spapapaper and the footprints with their and ready to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the sous, "wave, you can hear in the flamens.
In Spay -- when a artist has done something impossible and magic -- "Allah, magnificent -- a fleavoes," he meant -- a last of God.
And it's great.
But the problem comes the next day later, for the ballery -- when you sweat and found that are the 11 in the morning of Martednest Martedons.
It's just a great deal with a big male with male to the knee, and maybe maybe not can be able to make it more to each other.
And maybe nobody will give the name of God still as the game of the name of the lives?
It's hard to be difficult.
This is one of the most painful recognizing to make creative life creative remainly remarkable reception.
But maybe it doesn't have to be so angoting, if you can not be to believe, of the most extraordinary of your being being from you to yourself.
But I just believed you have to get the data from a inimaginable of this team of the founds of your life that you have to get somebody else when you have.
And, you know, if we think about this whole way change.
And so I started thinking about it, and it's sure as I thought, and it's sure as I thought, for several months in the design of the book that was going to be the dangerous success.
And what I have to continue to tell me when I feel element from this is, you don't have fabulous to be bad.
You don't get to the job. It's just your job.
It will be presenting for your parts, any of your parts, any can be.
If your work is ball, bally.
If the divin, I assurging genius decide to leave some kind of wonderful -- to just some kind of wonderful to a moment through your sforeign your sforward, then "O!" !"
Over the same thing you get your dance.
And "Oh, you know, you know.
I think I think I have to teach it.
"O!" "You know, even for the human beings, even for human and testing and testardages to be going to be going to define it is going to be going to be continuously to define it is going to be going to be going to be on the samorder.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: O!
As you know I've been talking about some of these projects on the genome of the genome of the new genome of genes.
Now we're starting a new percorso: we started to digitalize biology and now we started to start to the biology of biology, we're going to be in a new fasththizing and the sintetizing life.
We always tried to make great questions.
"What is the life?" is something that many biological I think we have to try to understand a levels.
We tried different approach, reducing the minimmers to the minimmers.
We are digitalizing for almost 20 years ormas.
When we sequenced the human genome was treated to the world from the biology world of biology in the digital world of the computer.
Now we ask ourselves to the life or to create a new life to digital with this digital universe?
This is the map of a small organism, the Mycoplasma genitalium, which is the genome of the most small organisms, which can carry in the lab.
And we tried to reduce the genome to create a little bit more smaller.
We can get a hundred of genes of genes of about 500 genes of about 500 that are here.
But when we get a chair, you get a metabolic map to the nostrength.
I think this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes we can get to the time, one to the time, is very impossible to take a cellula to the wind cells
So we decided that the only only way to progression was to synthesize this chromosome, we would make the mountain a way to make the fundamental components to make some of these questions.
And so we started the way the "Can we can synthesize a chromoso?"
Can the chemistry to produce these great molecules that we never can make the first we never can make before we do with the first of the earli?
And, in case of the business, we can make a chromoso?
A chromosomes is just a piece of chemical material.
The speedness we can digitalize the life is growing we can exponential exponential.
Our ability to write the genetic code, invaths, progressive to be better.
And our most recently results the leading curve on a curve curve of exponential.
We started more than 15 years ago.
The process has required a lot of the past, starting with a biothetic review.
But we found that synthesize DNA is very difficult.
There are tens of thousands of cars in the world that make little segment little segment of DNA, the longer of 30 to 50 letters and it's a degenerative process is longer long, more mistake than the chest segment is longer than the segment of DNA,
So we had to develop a new method to assembling these frames and correct the mistake the mistake the mistake the mistake the mistake the mistake of these frames.
And this was our first attemempt to start with the digital information of the genome of the Phi 174.
It's a little virus that kills kills bacteria.
We designed the framments, effectivate the correction of the mistake of DNA of about 5,000 letter letter of about 5,000 letter letter
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemical material and we put it into the bacteria have been going to read this genetic code and then they started reading this genetic code and to prove the virals.
The particles have been released by cells, they have come back and they have to release the Ecol.
I talked about recent with members of the petrozes say that they have certainly comfortable this model.
They have a more than you.
We believe that this is a situation where the software can actually build its own hardware in a biologists in a biological system.
But we wanted to do the biggest things in larger
We wanted to build the entire chromosome.
It's more than 580 miles the letters of genetic code.
So we thought we would build it in the cassets of virus, so that we can change the cassets to understand what the components of a cellula in the viventure of the viventure of the virus,
The design is crucial and if we start with digital information in a computer, these have to be very accurate about.
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995, the standard accurateless of a Tururaten for every 10 mibasis.
We have discovered resequence of the resequence of that original sequence that we would never be able to do it.
A part of the process is designing segment segment that they grow up with all the other other segate segment of 50 letters below 50 letters of the small small jobs to make the smaller work together.
We try to address.
You probably have a little bit that we can have a flight.
Think of it is: We have a bas-letter code code on four letter: A, CG and T.
To of those reading bond with about 20 adminimal adminious adminiodifies of reading for every love to each love with a local adminimal administration of being.
So we can use genetic code to write words, you can do with it.
What we did we have done at the beginning was thography.
Some they have been dolphins from the fact that it was not a poetry.
We designed these segment to just just make them a lot of miles.
There are both both employ and they put them and they put them on it.
And we started to get the parts, starting with five to seven miles to seven miles, to seven miles in a miles, to put a thousand miles, to their letter to 724 miletter to 724 miletter
Anpast we have produced these sitting in the abundance so that we are trying to try to create a very robaby proceing proception -- as you will see in a minute.
We are trying to automatization.
So, this seems like the tabellon a basket.
When we get these very long segments, more than 100 miles, more than 100 miles, they don't grow more directly in the E.
You get to the limits of the molecule.
So we looked at other mechanism.
We knew about another mechanism called recombination recombination called the Hology recombination of the DNA to repair the DNA to repair the DNA to repair the way to repair the segments.
Here's a example.
This organisms, called Deinothesis radioulans, can make three million rad radiation.
You can see in the square square like his chromosome.
In 12 -- 24 hours is reassembled exactly how it was before.
There are thousands of organisms that have been able to do that.
These organisms can check completely.
They can live under a vacues.
I'm absolutely sure that life exists in space, and you can get new rich environments to find new rich environments of water.
I mean, the NASA showed that this avene.
This is a picture of the molecule that we built using these processes -- just using the program of the design of the sat with the design of the meant of the meant chance.
The light-hold them to the car car car car car car car care.
This image is not been taken with a electronic microscope but with a regulate microscope of regulating microscope to rule.
It's a molecule that we can see it with a microscope with a microscope read.
These are pictures that they cover a period of about six seconds.
This is the publishing we did a little time ago.
It's more than 580,000 letters of genetic code.
It's the largest molecule of a definitely remarkable structure ever created by men --
He has a lot of the sought a lot of 300 million ones.
If we were going to stamp with a 10 without spaces, we would like 142 pages only to get this genetic code.
Now, how do we do it work? How can we activity it?
Obviously, you get a virus is a game of girls.
It's a little bit more complicated when they use bacteria
It's simpler even when it's about the eucariote like our ourselves to the nuclear and inserird cells and inserved, which is basically the process of cloning.
In the bacteria the chromosome, it's integrated inside the cells in the cell, but we have recently demonstrate that we can make a complete trail.
We purified a chromosomes from a microbial sort of microbial microbial sort of microbial chromosome.
The two are different as men from topis.
We added some gene in more way to decide what to choose to choose what to choose to this chromoon.
And it has the cholden with the hasn't been killing all the proteins.
And when we put it in the cells was stupend -- and you open our degree our degraphic dephic -- the new chromosome.
And we were really thinking we couldn't get the way to get lab, but we tried to do it more in there.
This is one of the greatest mecdochanisms of evolution.
We found that tanti-species, we added a second or third one third or a third of a third of a second thousands of new trates.
So who think about evolution as a gene to evolution as a gene to the time that you have no lot of the biologist.
There are the employees called "restricenterprisons of reactive reaction.
The chromosomes that was in the cells of it.
The cells that we have inserited that we inserited the ha.
And it turns out that expressed, and it recognizes how the expressed as the expressed, and we got to be return with only the cellula and the new cell cell and the new chromother.
It's became blue because of genes we have inserved.
And in a short lasses of time, all the characteristics of a sort of a sort of have lost kind of a new special software that we insert in a new software we insert in the cell.
All the proteins are changed, the members are changed, and when we read the genetic code the genetic code of what we have transfed.
Now, this might look like genetic alchemical alchemy -- but we can change things in a pretty substantial.
Now, I already explained that there is no talks about genesis -- but of the proprogress of evolution, and I said that maybe we're going to create a new version of Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosion of this digital process.
Why do I do that?
I think it's obvious when we think of our needs.
We are to spend six billion and a half billion people in the next 40 years.
Right to give you an example: I was born in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for each other people on the 1946; in 40 years, there will be four years, there will be a quick of the planet to be there.
We are now doing the problems now to find food, water and clean medicine, and a benzites for six billion and a half billion people.
It's going to be more hard to do for a billion billion billion billion billion
We use more than five billion carbon dion, more than 30 billion boildy.
That means a million barrels to the day.
When we try to find biological processes or whatever the kind of process to repeace them, will be a huge challenge challenge to report them.
We need to the more we have to get all the emission of CO2 materials that end up in the atmosphere.
On day, because of the science discoveries in the science of the world, we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I like to think that are the components for the future.
The electronic industry is a dozen of the components, and you think about how many different things are come out of the things are coming out of the things are coming out of them.
Our limits here are the principle, and our imagination.
Now we have a technical metods of these rapidly quotes that we call a combinatory of creating what we call a combinator.
We can build a big robots that can produce a million chromosomes a million chromosomes a day.
Think of process, these 20 million genes or to try to get the processes to make the processes to make either drugs, new vaccines, we can change a little theam, and we can change a lot more molecular biology now now that in the last 20 years of science.
And it's just a standard selection.
We can choose to a chance to survive a chicken-carbon or carbon vaccepts.
This is a instant instantant of some software programmed that we're working to be able to be able to sat and design species species to the computer.
Well, we don't need to be like this.
We know exactly what their genetic code.
Now we're going to focus of fourth generation.
You also saw you have seen that you get it from the grased was a mmous.
We have carbon on on the third generation that will use enough to be prazucchery of the highest carbon die as the either either or different thropes.
But the only way the biology can have a great impact without increasing more than increasing foods and limited the cost of food and limiting the die would be transforming the cells that we are working on the primary cells that can reach this purpose to this purpose and we can get this purpose to about 18 months.
The only one of the combined with the CO2 is a metodo's discovered in all the world, we found different methods.
This is a organism that we described in 1996.
It's living in the deep ocean -- about 2,500 meters of the ground temperature of the water.
They create metane metane from CO2 using hydrogeno molecular as the source of energy.
We are trying to figure out if we can get the CO2, which can easily be transported to be transported to the CO2 in the carbon urant, to drive this process.
So we think about a short we could be able to increase what the question is, "What is the life." And the question that is the Noi, versus -- we have the modest goal of repricing the whole industry.
Yeahh! If you can't do it from TED, where you can?
It would be a main of energy.
And we are working on the same metodies to make the same metods to create vaccines.
You saw this year with influence, we are always behind a year and a dollar in less when it's about to find the right vaccine.
I think what you can change in the antician ans.
This is how the future might be beginning to look like this, now, the tree of evolution, accerate evolution with bacteria -- accelerate the evolution with the ground.
We are so so much from improving people.
Our purpose is to do it in a way of living enough to try to try to do it. Thank you very much.
First of all of you will have to see the fastest thing we have to be a fundamental queenable to the Microsoft in following a year ago is Seadragon.
It's a environmental environment, where you can interact with a local amount of visual data that remote with a huge amount of data data here.
We're seeing a lot of giant images of digital images of digital images with a kind of swoom and continuous fast panoramic fast breakes.
And it doesn't matter how big the amount of information that we seen, how big these things are the big thing or images.
Most of them are all digital photographers, but this is a provide proventing from the Library of Congress, and reenter in the legal legacy of 300 megapixel.
It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that limits the prestations of a system like this is the number of plxel on your screen in any time.
This is a book book of data.
This is the Casa desolated of Dickens. Each colonna represents a capitule.
To show you that it's about testing and not imagines, we can do something like this, to do something like this, to do that is a representation of the head, not of a picture.
It could be a little artificial way to read a electronic book to read a electronic book to read a electronic book to read a little artificial book to read a little artificial book to read.
You don't reach it.
This is a more realistic example. It's a number of the Guardian.
Every big image is the beginning of a sea.
And it really gives you the pleasure of the experience of reading the version of a review of a review or a review of a review or a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a little bit of a meeting.
We also did something with the corner of this number in particularly of this number in the Guardian.
We created a fashion fasulla to solve solve -- much more than you use in a normal normal advertis; and we ended in the extraordinary content -- and we inserved.
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile, you can see here.
Or other models, or even the specific specific specific --
And this really shows some of these ideas to get the limits space on the screen.
We hope that this guys put a little bit to put a few of them to the pop-up to the pop-up to be necessary.
Of course, the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology.
And I don't want to lose time, if we don't want to say that we have contributing to give them a came.
These are all the streets in the U.S. sovels in the U.S.
So now we go to a little bit of something else.
This is actually from the webs; you can go to the webs; you can see it.
It's a project called Photosynth, which fights two different technologies.
A is Seadragon and the other is a visual research to be very interesting visual computer provide in the University of Washington, with the help of the Rick Szelii of the UWashington, with the Rick Szelii Microsoft Research Research of Microsoft Research Research of Microsoft Research Research of Microsoft Snaviger is a very interesting
And it's from the web, managed to Seadragon.
You can see it when we do this kind of pattern that we can go from one and have this kind of experience to resolve solution to resolve the multiple experience.
But the space collection of the images here has actually a meaning.
The soritches of computers have recorded these images together, in the computer have been recorded these images together, so that you can see the reals that you can see the remarkable told. And they have been taken on the Monaga. So you see the dogs -- they have been saved. So you see the elements of a de-stable de-stable things are all space.
I don't know if I have time to show you some other environment.
There are a lot more spacecrafer space.
I want to go directly to one of the original data data -- and this is from a previous prototype of Photosynthosynthosynthths that we did work for the first time -- to show you what I think is the very clothespecially the surprising this technology, and it's not necessarily as much as much as well. And it's not necessarily so much evident to the environments that we put in the web.
We had to worry about the legal and I say it.
This is a reconstruction of the cattedral of Notree Dame images previse Flickr. Basta Flickr and you get images of the campus and get images of the campus and the represents and the represents a picture of these around.
So they're all images from Flickr and they were all connected to the space in this way.
And it's possible to navigate in this simple way.
You know, I never thought I would never think of finish to work for Microsoon on
It's very gratification to get this kind of collection here.
I think you can see that it's a lot of different types of different fotos, from those of the phones to the SLR, a number significant ant phone number of meaning, it together in this environment.
And if I can try to try and find those more strange.
Many are block of them are blocks, etc.
Some of here is a number of photographs -- it is a series of photographers.
This is a poster of Notre Dame record.
We can go from the physics of this environment.
The essential point is that we can do with the social environment. This is now taking the data from all of the things of how to collective as the world's therefore of visual visual data -- and connecting all these data data together.
All those pictures become connected together, larger than the non-non-non-parts.
You have a model of the interaction of the interact.
Think about this as a promote of Stephen Lawler on the Earth virtual Too Lawler on Earth virtual Tururgy.
It's something that grows in complexity as the people are using it, and the people are using them to make it with useful use.
Their pictures are smark with other people.
If somebody is the idea of contrast all these things say say the names of the nest images of Notre's cattedral of all those data, and I can use it as a recipe of these data data and I can use the promers to immergery in the space, in that metaphors to get a social experience.
Of course, a consequence of all of this are actually models virtual models of every part of the earth, they don't only only as a kind of sex and airplanes from the fairplanes and a million and several memory of the mothers.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I realized what your software going to be able to do is to make is that to make is that in the next years, all photographs of the world or will be basically connected to everyone in the world or will be connected together?
BAA: Yeah. What is doing is actually discovered.
It's a lot of the hyperlink, if you want to get the images.
And it's doing it in the base of images.
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the rich information that many of these images of these images can be several images of these images can sell it.
As you get a research of images on the web, you know, a sentence and the test of the web, is a lot of information about the images of the images of the picture.
Now, what if that picture is to all your picture?
So the amount of interconnections and the amount of seeds and the amount of rich that will have to be enormous classic. It's a classical classic.
CA: Blaise, it's really amazing
BAA: Thank you very much.
One of the main of the main when you travel and one of the delilight-to-to-graphic research is the way to live in the wind of the ancient of the past, in the wind wind in the wind wind today, the swing slessons in the sleeps of the plants.
You think that the monkeys are Jaguar travel even beyond the Milky that the mythy of the older of the older of the people who are in Himalaya, the good distinct of the Dharm of the British of the British of the British Basuar of the CEEE: the idea that the world in absolute that there is absolute in absolute reality, but it's just a model of reality,
the consequence of a particular set of choices that our stirts that our stirts has done -- a lot of generations ago.
And, of course, we all share are the essential tracts.
All we procreate.
We are the represents to start staration.
We need to deal with the death of more, so we don't surprising and whales --
We all have a art.
What it is the particular one is the particular, the range of every culture.
Not important that are the forests of Borneo, or the following of the Borneo, or the Haiti, or the Haiti, or the Curandal Curanderriesths, Curandal Curander's Curandero of Ans, or a camels in the heart heart of the Saharan War.
He was my companies of journey in the desert a month ago, or a ball of the West -- and a walls of the Qoman's desert in the world.
All these populations teachers teachers are other ways of thinking about existing other ways of thinking about how to move in the world.
And, if you reflect a time, is a concept that can give you hope.
Insides, the culture of the cultures, the world creates creating a spiritual of the world and cultural cultural life and is important for the benefits the planet like the planet as the biosphones.
And you can think about this raild cultural as a hetnosfast and you can call the ethnosfast of all the concepts of all the concepts of all the concept, and ideas, inspirations, intuitions in being from the imagination of the tree of the conflics.
The etnosfast is the fantastic potential of human human human human manity.
It's the symbol of what we can be in how we can be in how much as a sort of inquisities.
And because the whosphery was really consumed as it was so much as it was so much faster and uncertainly faster.
No biology, for example, would say that 50 percent of all the species was or is about the earth of the summer -- in the summer of the most apocalitable -- in the most apocalittics -- and you don't have to have a little bit of the cultural ipotentiential -- that of the cultural diversity -- that diversity of all the culture.
The indicate of all of course, is obviously, the whole language
When you're bored 6,000 lings.
A language is not a composal language or from a series of the graphical.
A language is the price of human spirit of human spirit is the price of human spirit is the price of the spirit.
It's the half of the animation of every culture,
Each language is a forest, a forest, a skill, a thinking of a spiritual ecosystem.
And of those 6,000 languages, as we are sitting in Monterey, at least half of the hair, less half is sussurrated in oreckings.
They don't get more teaching to children, the means that they don't get something that they diddn't.
What is there is more than being the silence of silence, of being the last to talk about a language of the world to talk about a language of the hasn't that make the southern of the daugh?
This orrying was a few of the world every two weeks every two weeks a few weeks a little bit of a few weeks are going to be a little bit of a big language of a big language.
And I know somebody to tell you "Don't be better like this?
The world would not be a better place if we were all the same language to all the same language of the world we talk all yoruba.
We talk about kogi.
You will be going to be able to be able to talk about not to talk about their language.
I would like to do a journey through the etnos' etnostopped --
a little journey in the etnos; you can give you a suit of what we're lost we are lost loss.
Many of us say that when I say "different ways of existing in the different ways of existing existing different ways of existing existing different ways of existing
Let's take for example, this mable Barasana, in Amazony Sevevening the population of anacony that creates the mit of the llasts of the lasts of the slasts in the slasts of serpacries.
It's a population that is not able popular to distinguish the blue blue because the celests is identified in the forest, which dipends dipends the population.
They have a strange language and a matrimonial, they said, "Hoy" "exogamica's language talks about a different language of language --
All of that has roots in the pastorder, the particularity is that in these extreme in these extreme in six or seven seven tlings.
They are limited to listen and then they start talking about.
Let's take one of the more interesting tribes with the which I lived -- the Waorani of the Ecuador nordororange of the nordoral population that has had the first contact in 19588.
In 1957 five mission of the 1957 mission of a face.
They made it out of the photographs that they would reach them in a few that they were going to evolve them that this population of the forest, they didn't see any bi-dimensional pluvial of the size of the dimensional dimensional.
They collected the pictures of the ground, they have a form or a phone of the shape, they didn't find that they had treated that they had treated that they had been killed and they killed the diavolies.
But the Waorans didn't have to kill the straniers.
They killed between them.
545 percent of the death was caused to their own stessi.
We are saved to eight generations and we found two natural death death and when we insisted for saper, they have admit that one of them was invest that it was invected to be aged to be able to be able to be inject.
The cutters were able to recognize the animal from 40 steps and recognizing the species.
In the early '80s, I was assigned a really interesting compleased when my leman of Harvard South if I wanted to go to Haiti to the basic companies in the basic society of Duvalizes and Tonton Macoutes, and imposing the velened to make the weleness of the velened to do the hombie.
To make a sense of miracracule, I had to have to understand the Voodoo and that Voodoo is not a black had.
It's pretty much of a metapaphor of the world.
Very interesting.
If you ask you to tell me the great religions of the world, what would I say?
Cristian: Hough -- Buddho, Ebrism, Ebrism, etc.
A continent is always left out of the sub-Saharan Africa has no religious ffairly and the Voodoo is not the other religious guys in the Voodoo is not the other religious religious of the slavery in the slavism of the slavia.
What is interesting to make your voodoo is the intense of life and more.
So the viral vives you the spirit.
The spirits can be invocated by Grande Acqua, they say the dance of dances and they replace the dance of the vivision of the vivision that for a short way to a short way it comes the following becomes the following becomes the following becomes the die.
So this voodoodooist to say, "You can go to a lot of people go to speak about God.
We give you in the temple and we become God."
And from the moment that you have a posseduced you that you drive you guess to you have you have to be.
So you get these incredible events in the state of tracks that touch in the state of trances that touch touch the uncles in the power of the power of the power of the mind of the power of the mind of the mind of the power of the mind of the very excited.
You all the people with the most extraordinary of the most extraordinary Kogi of the Sierra Nevada in the Colombia secentrional secentrional.
The civilization of the ancient civilization that once they lived on the careers of Colombia in the attempt in the wild of the vulcanic mass that would be on the vulcanic mass that you get on the floor.
In a continent continent of blood of blood of blood that people never been conquick.
On all the today, they have a click but their formation is actually extraordinary device.

What does it mean you would say,
This tribe, the Cofan, has 17 variety of ayahuas, which distinguished in the forest, and that our eyes would be in the same species.
If we ask how they are going to tell us how they stabit to tell us how they were going to be able to byon? I said, "No."
The solution is they take 17 variety in a night of a bunch of a bunch and each one will be a different tune.

Now the problem is not change.
All the culture through the cents have been involved in a dance to new possibility of life.
And the problem is not the technology.
The Indian Sioux have no being Sioux when they put them on the arrange and free free and free so as Americans have no exist to be Americans when they put them on the hot.

Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some things I wrote in this book that I hope you have heard and try to prove some of the connection that you have heard of the connections that you have heard of the things that I hope you don't notice them.
I want to start with what I call "the offic."
The dog's office of what the dog?
The office office of all the industrial society society society y society y society is going to be a recity.
The reason why is that the freedom is in the fact that the freedom is in the same value, is pretable value, is pretable for human beings.
On the other is in the fact that if we are free, each of us can account to do everything that mous, without any decide to do anything that mouse in the name of our.
The way to mass the freedom is to be a choice.
The more choice people are going to be free, and more and more and more and it's their freedom, more hours is their freedom.
This is that reprice, it's so deep in society that no one would have dreamed it in twice.
And it's also deep into our lives.
I'm going to show you some examples of what progress is that the progress of what progress is possible.
This is my supermarket. It's not particularly great.
I lost a simple note on the condiments for insane to insales.
In my supermarket is 175 conditions, without contextract the 10 variety variety of extracets, and 12 acets, you can buy a huge number of bunch of the constantly of the incost of the most constent of the 175 ready is of your degradiment.
This is what the supermarket.
Then you go to the sought of electronic electronic: cassassasses, reading CD, radio plast, the press of the hons.
And in this single single uncle of electronic electronic components are audience.
We can make six million different combinations using the components that there are in a snegoties.
You need to admit that there is a lot of choice.
Some camp: the world of communications.
One time, when I was a child, they could get all the phone to the phone to the phone that were forced by mama Bell.
He was the phone the phone hand, you don't get it.
A consequence of that, in the other, it was that the telephone is that the telephone is made.
These temples are gone.
We have a nearly illimitated variety of telephone cells.
Here's the cells of the future.
My favorite is what in better, reading MP3, cuttapels of the nose and foreign for the Blap.
If you don't have seen in the south, you have no way you get in the wild of you will prevent it.
And what is the end thing is that people go into the southern and it makes this question and it makes this question and it says, "No."
You can't buy a cellphone that doesn't do too many things.
So, in other aspects of life that are much more important than the water, it is the same explosion of choice.
Assistance. It's not going to happen in the United States that you will go from the doctor and the doctor of the dramework you have to do.
I went from the doctor, and I said, "Okay, you could do that, or B" "You can do -- "B" "B" "B" "B" "B" "Betee?"
You say, "Dr. r. what would I have to do that?"
And the doctor says, "A has these benefits and these rises, and Bha has these benefits and these risk."
"What do you want to do that?"
And you rebate "Dr. if she was me, what do I do?"
And the doctor. "But I don't have leies."
The result of the malato," we call the malato," expression that it seems to be a beautiful thing.
But it is actually not that one to move the fish and the responsibility of the decisions that you know something, you know, it's not -- and almost almost certainly uncertainly is not not -- and almost certainly it is not in the ideal condition.
There is a huge marketing marketing products of drugs to people like me and you know, if you think you don't have any sensen senior sense, that we can't buy them.
But if we can't buy them because they can you buy them all the audience
The answer is that they want to do we call the doctor to ask the doctor to change the reception.
What about so fundamental as it is our identity is a question of choice, like you see in this vign, "We don't want to get the children. We don't want to be able to be a bit more identity." We don't want to invent the right house. We need a longer issue.
And we can reinvention us how many times we can reinvent.
The means that every morning is the risk of your people want to be able to you want to have to be able to be.
I think about the family and the matrimoney, a time time the perspective perspective of the community, they had to be able to anyway, and it was going to be able to do the most premingly possible.
The only versus was with you chemistry, and not even what do we do later.
On day, all of it is really to play it.
I mean, I think about very smart students and they are 20 percent in less than a time.
And because they don't have to be blead because they don't have to diligents.
but why are they implemented to ask you or say, "I should I have to do it now? I should do it now?
"Would I sposite I would think before you get the kids or to the career or to the care?"
I'm interranging of logive.
And they try to answer these questions, even if this implements don't have to be the companies that you don't get a good good vote to my exame.
And they have to do that. I'm going to do that.
Now, the job: We are lucky as Carl underlyms, because the technology allows us to work every single single single angle of the planet, except that from the Hotel Randolph.
Turders, there is a corner and I won't say anybody to do anybody and where the WiFi works.
I don't say that, because I want to use it.
What meaning, this amazing is the freedom of choice that we have about working on work? It's that we have to go to the job.
We can go to see our son players to calculate with the cellphone in a pocknew, and the narrows, and the nice night in the knee.
And even if I have all the minute we see our boundary boundary the head, we are also asking this call?"
"I have to answer this email? I have to email?
And even when the answer is "no," all this makes the experience of your son son son of your son son son son son is in other conditions.
So, from any part of we look like small and big things and the materials and stils of life, life is a question of choice.
One time the world was this: Ovo, there were some possibilities, but it was not a question of choice.
The world today is like this: The world is this: The dilemma is what is a positive thing or negative?
The answer is the reason about that.
The position of the good question.
All this choice is two behaviors in two effects of the gain.
The primary, parados; it's that produces instead of freshing.
With many options between the options that are going to be very hard to do it.
I offer an example of a significant example of a study conducted on the planets of flike---of-ter-of-plan for a flight-ter-bad.
A colleagued to the data of Vancer, the giant of the Vancer, the giant companies of depension, with about a million clients.
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are going to be offered in more, the percentage of the adedesion of the 24 percent.
With 50 sources of offeres, there is 10percent in less than when they are available to when they are available to 5. Why do they they are available to 5. Why do that?
Because with 50 sources that you choose to the choose of the way to decide and choice is remains.
And I wonder and I still ask question, and of course questions, and of course the questions don't get it.
You can open that means not just that these old work from the old hands because they don't have enough money, because they don't want to say that the decision is so obstacking the fundamental fundamental of the dator job.
Not speaking are losing to 5,000 dollars for a year from the dator of the job, which would be ben disract.
So the paralysis is a consequence of having too many choices.
And I think that makes the world like this.
"And for fine, for the ethchup, "ketchup, or maining or main?"
You want to take the right decision of the right decision if it's for the eternity, right?
You don't want to choose the wrong, and they don't want to choose the wrong.
So this is the first effect is that we can avoid the paralyside, and we end, and we ended up to the end of how we would be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to avoid that you choose to the walk of the way that you can avoid the paralyside.
And this for different reasons.
One of these is that with many conditions between the bodies that you choose and it's not perfect, is easy to imagine that you could have a different choice that would be better than it would be better than the alternative imagined us to be better than the alternative imagined us to the choice, and the remaining of choice, and remaining the remaining of the decision --
even when it was a good decision.
More choices us are easy to be able to make any detail of any details that is insoddisying the choice.
And the one is that economists call the expensive opportunities.
DGilbert has a very well stamattina how we get to the things that we get to the things that we depends on the way we confrontied.
Del rest, when there are many options possible, is easy to represent, is easy to be able to be less soddisablesses of the option that you have choice.
Here's an example. I scuse with all the ones that are not in New York.
But it's probably what you probably think about it.
There is this copy to Hamptons.
A place of the luse.
Spion splendid. It's all about them.
Not manufactly. But what he thinks is: "Well, you know, it's Agsto."
"All my neighbors to Manhattan are living.
"I could park right to the front of hous."
And he spent two weeks that is allowing the idea that is lost -- every day -- the possibility of parking where you want.
The cost opportunities to dimine the soddisfation for what we have, even when the choice was exciting --
And the most are the options we have to consider the most of the expensive active carrying with opportunities.
Here's another example.
This vivision tells us a lot of things.
And it talks about living the moment, and maybe live in the time.
But the most important point is that you can choose you get to not to do the other.
The things that we don't choose have a lot of attractive acties that can make less what we do.
Third point, spiral growing of ways.
I tried to my skins buy a new jeans.
And it's almost always jeans.
One time the jeans were a lot of a lot of people and they were going to be bought in the besty, they were sweeping them and work and they were a lot of times, they started going to get well.
So I went to buy a couple of new when the old old people were ged, and I said, "I'm going to have a couple of jeans, this is my cutt."
The common to me, "Li wants slim fit, fit, relaxed and fit?"
Do you want to do it with the bottonies? "Stonehed" or "Could you like that?
"What do you want?"
"Would you want to get the band stret? Bll." He was the blake to elend,
I was sleep, and after a little bit of I could say, "I want the kind of -- that was the only guy -- that was the only one of the hour of the hour of the hair, and then I tried to all the 'these, and then out of the negotiti, with the best jeans that I had ever had ever had been had.
It was the massive mous. With all that choice I had the better.
But I felt a worse.
Why? I wrote a book to understand it.
The reason I was worse to is that I was that with all that choice the choice were expected to be perfected.
I was expected to minim. I didn't expect to be a lot of exceptional when he was living 100 different places, they were 100 different places, at least a bunch of a different time.
What I had watched was good -- but not perfect.
And after I had paragoned to what I was trying to try to get insoddisted to the waiting for expectancy.
The addition of options in the life of the people don't make the expect that these have respect to the options of the options in the options of the options in the life of the options in the life of the options in the life of the options in the life of the options of the options in the life of the options in the life of the options in the life of the options that these are respect of the options in the options
And this will provide less soddisfation, even when the results are good and they are good for them.
None in the world of marketing if they make it.
Because if you know what I'm talking about.
The truth truths looks like.
"You know, it was better when he was worse when he was worse when he was worse when he was worse when he was worse to it was still able to meet the premise of evolved.
On day, in the world we live -- opulationalized industrialized citizens with the perfeeding of perfeation -- the massive that we can hope is that the things are going to be the along.
You never have a surprise pleasures you to get expectations because your waiting for themselves and they are ingiant it.
The secret of happiness -- what you're here -- "Basasas." "Yes, you want to me." "Yes, you want."
I want to say -- small moment -- that are actually smiles, and my wife is really amazing and my wife is really stupending.
I couldn't do better, I didn't have a meet of them are accounted in it.
But they don't always get a good thing is not always a good thing.
And finally, a consequence of the jeans smooths when there is only that kind of jeans is that when you don't get soddisappearing, and you ask you "Why do that?"
"Who is responsibling? The answer is clear.
The world is the responsible. What I could do about it?
When there are hundreds of jeans, and you get a insoddisking -- and you ask you who is the responsible responsible is the very clearly as you have to you.
You could do better.
With hundreds of different variety of the available variety of the success.
So when people take decisions, they also feel if the result is valized, they feel insodynamed and damage to their own itself.
In the last last years the depression is exploded in the industrialized world.
I think a significant factor -- not the unique thing -- not the unique -- of this hondipression is that people have deludent because the standards are too alone.
And when they have to explain this situation thinking,
So the final result is that in general is that we are better, but we feel worse.
Let me tell you about it.
This is the official offical, what we all take for good and it's completely failed.
There is no doubt that a little choice is better than having a little bit better than that we don't have any choice that a little bit better than a pounds a little bit better than a pop pound.
There's a critical value, magic value. I don't know what you are.
But I'm sure we have been super-level that we have super-level to make our life.
Now, from political point of political view, I have almost finished -- from policy point of policy is the following.
What it allows all this choice in the industry is the ricultural riculture.
There are many places in the world, and you know what the problem is not that they have too too many choices.
The problem is they have too much a few of them.
So the thing I'm talking about about is a mality of modern -- it's a mality of modern society that society societies.
And what it makes you depress and array is this: Steve Levitt talks about how the cost of the cost and swing seats are ineful.
I want these choices, complicated and you dependioss, it's not just to be ineat.
I'm detherious to the deleteries.
They make worse.
If a little bit of what in our societies allows to be reversed in the way people have too much possibilities, it would not be just the possibility to be going to be better.
This is what economists call a better better better better.
A redistributed revenation is good to all -- not just the poor of this choice in the except of this choice in the except that I get us to us.
To we, you can get all that you want, you can become what you want,
Yes, people of culture, you know, what it makes that fish makes that fish wei?"
"It's obvious that you can't make anything in a vetron of vetrow."
"A imagination imagination of the world."
and I got the whole thing I got it interpreted it out.
But then, I think, I realized, I realized that the fish knows the long time.
Because the reality of the fact is that if you managed the mouths the boccurs the boccurs of the freedom.
If you roll the mouse in a way that everything you can diminual soddisfation.
You get the paralysis, and you reduce the benefits
Everybody needs a stop.
This is almost certainly too much too streted, maybe even for the fish and safe for us.
But the assume of some symboolic symbolic for infelicity and temo, temo, for the rovina.
Thank you very much.
