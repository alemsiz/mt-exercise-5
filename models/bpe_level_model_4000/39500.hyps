Last year, I showed these slide to demonstrate that the artical calotta have been the artical heat at at the size of 48 United States of the U.S. continental continental continental is 40-percent.
However, this undervalue of the problem because it doesn't show the pace of the ice problem because it doesn't show the ice of the ice.
The artical heat becomes in a way, the clear heart of the global climate system
It expand it reverse and return it back into the summer.
The next slide is going to be a quick fast on the last 25 years.
The sea ice local severed in red red
As you see, you get to the blue Europe of blue --
That's the ice in the winter that reports of summer.
You can see that the so-called five cosident or more, is like the blood here is like blood here from the body.
In 25 years old, it was like this.
This is a problem because the rescale of the kind of ice around the artc of the artic ocean around the artc of the artc coal that you will shake from the microbes.
I rejoined to the total pollution, global warming, that amount of warming, that amount of it may doubled this point of unless returning this point of unreturning around.
In some deep Lahi, the deeping is already rebolling from the water.
The Katey Walter Katey Walter of the University of Alaska was brought with a team bunch lake in the last night.
Video: Wow! Al Gore: She is good. The question is if we are going to be us.
A reason is that this train termic surrounding, the Groenland, the Northern from the north.
This is a glacial record river.
The brought never reached the levels.
This is the Kanlussian River, in the egger of the Groenllland,
If you want to know how the sea level of the sea ice of ice on the ground, here is where the sea.
These currently currently are increasing rapidly.
Another on the other part of the planet. Again, the greatest blocks on the planet.
The last month of the scientists have declaim that the ice is in negative, and that Antarctartide Western that pink on some submarine islands on the underwater on some submarines on the underwater and the sheet shake of the ice is in the negative leaviver.
Equival in a six-feet of water, like in Groenllland,
Himalaya, the third largest block of ice, you see new laghi, you see new laghi, who were glaciers.
40 percent of the world's population remote half of the poundly water from the monkey to the monkey
Sulle Ande: This ice is the source of the water source of this city.
The brought is increased.
But when it diminuisces, the same happening at the water.
In California snow in California 40-percent.
The hydrogen kiss are in crisis.
The predictions, as you have, are grave.
The sexity growing up in the world leads to a remarkable increase of the fires.
The environmental disasters are increasing a rhythm and unprecedented.
Four times the most numbers of the last 30 years than the previous 75.
This is a whole whole thing.
If you look in the history of the history of the same as you can see the consequences.
We have 70 million tons of CO2 of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons of the oceans every day.
Look at the oriental area of the Pacific, from Amer, in the west, and in both the parts of the subcontinent in the Indian in-continent oxygen in the ocean ocean is impose in the ocean ocean area.
The biggest cause of global warming, together by deforestation, which is 20, it's the use of fossil fuels.
The oil is a problem, and the fuel is even worse.
The United States are one of the two countries with the most emissions, with the China.
And it was proposing a lot of other carbon central plants.
But we're looking at a direction of a direction.
These are the projects in the last few years and some of the alternative proposites.
Anyway, there's a political lotta in our country.
The carbon industry and have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promoting carbon clean carbon oxymore.
That image I would reminded me something:
Very Natalalalso, in Tennessee, where there was a 3.8 billion gallons of carbon dioxial dies.
Maybe you saw it on the news
This is the second largest flow of scories in America.
It happened around Natal.
The natalization of one of the carbon industry was this.
Video: The coal coal is a frostage is a kind of allies.
It's abundant here in America, and it makes our economy.
Frosty the carbon is increasingly more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more cleer.
It's a good price, adorable, and the work workers keep the sticking.
Al Gore: From here is a great part of the West Virginia.
The biggest minerary company, on the mountains Massey Coal. This is his friendly.
Don Bland, Don Blland, and I'm going to be clear -- Al Gore, Nancy Reid -- they don't know what they're talking about.
Al Gore: So the Alleance for the Clima Proteon has been launched two campaigns.
This is one of them is a side.
Video: ALer: We see COALergives we see the climate changes like a night in our business.
So that we priority is to invest a great amount of money in a smart sending public and confused to make it public and confused to the carbon truth and confused to carbon truth and consuming carbon truth and consuming the carbon truth and consuming the carbon is on to invent a great amount
In fact, carbon is not spore.
We think it's cleaned -- it has a good profume.
So not push about climate change.
Let me do it.
Video: A: Colian clean -- you heard a lot of it -- you heard a lot of it.
So let's do a whole thing in a framework for the very foldly about the coal coal coal coal coal coal coal.
Straordinary! The cars are a little romany, but this is the sound of the technology of the clean technology of the clean technology
The carbon consuming is between the main causing global warming, but the remarkable technology in the same way.
To look at this is the odierna technology of the fuel of the carbon technology
Al Gore: Infinally, the alternative alternative is connected to the economic issues and national security.
Go come to the crisi; America is in crisi; the national security crisis.
The file that lines all that lines all that we have fossil fuels and the oil oil oil and the oil oil oil matter.
Now, there's a new new classroom for the circles.
America; 100 percent of clean energy, in 10 years.
A plan to re-and-a-a-and-a-and-a-hold and help the global warming.
Finally, one of the solution, that basts to solve our problems.
No America. You're going to be more --
Al Gore: This is the last one.
Go require energy in America.
One of the fastest ways of end end end up the dependence that they kill our planet.
Comparsa: The future is here. Vently, sun: a new network of energy.
Comparently number 2: Novi investment for jobs to work well well retribe.
Comptud: Reach. It's time to be realist.
Al Gore: A proverbial African proverbial says, "If you want to go fast, go from itself.
If you want to go away from them, you go together."
We have to go far fast.
Thank you very much.
Last year at TED I did an introduction on the LHC.
And I promises to go back to the way you can update on how the machine.
So here I am there -- and for those that the other time there are no her, the LHC is is the biggest scientific experiment that you have been tempted -- 27 miles of circumstances.
His joy compit is to reach the conditions that were fewer than a billion of the universe -- until 600 million times a second.
This is just the environment.
This is the car under Gineven.
We do these min-Big Bang in the relevel.
This is what I work. It's called ATLAS -- it's tours to 44 meters and has a diameteter.
This is an ATLAS image of ATLAS in building so you can see the proportion of the proportion of ATLAS in building so you can see the proportion of ATLAS in building so you can see the proporations.
The 10 section of the last year we have accept the car for the first time.
And this picture was taken by ATLAS.
It was because of immense immense in the control room in control.
It's a picture of the first phasocies that had done all the around of the LHC, entertaining into the collision, with a part of the LHC, and spreading particles inside the reach.
In other words, when we saw that picture the 10 secember, we knew that the car working, which is a great living.
I don't know if this was going to exult than that, when somebody went on Google and saw on Google and saw that the page was this.
That means that we had a cultural impact beyond scientific impact over the scientific impact
About a week later, there was a problem with the machine, had to these gaps here -- these dorates.
These files bring 13,000 amps when the car works at the massive of the power of power.
Now, the technicians in some of you will look at the files and say, "It's not true. It's not true. It's too badly under."
And they can do it because when they're very co-called superconducting files.
So, at least 271 degrees, at least 271 degree temperature to the stellar of the stellells, these files can bring that current.
In one of the junctures between the LHC, there was a defect of factory factory.
So the films have a read read read read about and 13,000 amps improvised a electrical resistance.
This was the result.
Now, this is even more impressive, if you think these magnety fish over 20 tons and that have moved about 30 incentimeters.
They were damaged about 50 magnets.
We had to take them off, what we did to do with it.
We repristined them and upside.
Now they're now coming back all of their place on the ground.
By the end of the march LHC will be new integrated again.
And we would like it, and we expect to get the right data to just, and we continue that our adventure to find out what are the morning that are the morning that are the universe.
Now, of course, in a way, these accidents reaching the debate on the value of science and engineering and science engineering and science engineering and science engineering and science engineering.
I think that the fact that it's so difficult, the fact that I think is the value of things like LHC.
I want to end with words of a Inglese scientist in the English scientist in the defense of his pupill, the defense of his pupill, his pupill, his pupill, Michael Faray, he said, "No is so dangerous for progress of the human mind of the human mind of the human mind is that there are no mysteries in nature, that there are no new money, that there are new monies of conquison for progress.
Thank you.
I want to start asking you to rethink how a kid to be a kid in the morning.
While you understand how to reach them and grab them, take them and move them and move them and move and get them to solve them and solve it and solve relationships.
The space reasoning is deeply connected to the way we understand most of the world around us.
So, from the uses of inspired by our interaction with ention-in-objects, with my Pacial objects, and my collaboratatator Jevator Jevan Kalanithi, I started asking it, "And when we use a computer, instead of having the only cursor of the digital cursles, we could only get on a digital deal with entertain of your hands, we could make a information with entering your hands,
and we set up our pleasurage about our pleasure.
The question was so interesting that was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer, building Siftable.
In a words, a Siftable is a great interactive computer.
In a words, a Siftable is a great interactive computer.
You can move them with your hand, they can see them in their hands, they can see their movement and they have a wireless radio and a wireless radio radio wireless radio --
But most of course, they're physical, they're physical, as the morning, they can move just afferting.
The Siftable is an example of a new ecosystem for a new ecosystem to manipulate information digital information.
And as they become more physicist, you realize the movement, of others, and as they become more physical, others, and as they become more physical, and others, as we die, of others, how we die, we can explore new and funny style interaction.
I'm going to start with some simple examples.
This Siftable is configurated to show vide: if you include it in a direction, the video will rotate the video will row like this, if you include from the other side back.
These interactive rush rushed other of the others.
If you aff, you care about what they are going to be on it.
If they come circumstances, they can get it a little bit.
If they come circumstances, they can get it a little bit.
They also have their movement and clining.
We then realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was the way that we can use the common with the data, as a liquid that like a liquid was a liquid of the interaction of the interaction of the interaction of the interaction was the way that you can use the common to the data, as a liquid that one of the interesting implications
In this case, we have three Siftable configured as byyph and I can use them to be on the color in that central and that they are mix.
and I can use them to be able to be able to be mixed.
We can be too too much to get to a little bit of the place.
There are also nice to learning, like languages, the mathematics and games where people can try to try and quickly see the things and see the results of the things and see the results of the immediately.
Now I'm --
This is a Fibonacy sequence that I do with a equations.
Here we have a game of words that is in half of the Scarabeo and Boggle.
On every turnally, at every turns, you get a letter to every Siftable, Pratically, every turns, you get a letter to any turn Siftable, and while you try to compose words he control a dictionary to be a dictionary to be a dictionary.
Then, after about 30 seconds of them remissed up, and you have a new set of letters and new possibility.
Thank you.
This is what children came to the Media Lab, I made them and I went to the way that they tried them and I turned a video video
They are very pleasure.
And one of the interesting things about this kind of application is that you don't have to give you many people a educational educational people.
You've just got to say, "Compundaries," and they know exactly what to do.
Here's what they try it.
This is our younger head there, there on the right.
It actually wanted to be willing to be in them.
They were only in the morning.
Now, this is an application of a interactive cardon --
We wanted to build a tool for learning in the learning of the learning of the English is Felix.
It can put new characters in the scene, lifting Siftable their associated associated.
It can put new characters in the scene, lifting Siftable their associated associated.
So, it's doing it out of the sun.
Video: The Sun.
David Merrill: Now he brought a treatment in the scene.
Video: The argument.
Bl: Yes!
So we are Siftable and put them close up can make the characters --
Video: Bau!
--
Video: How!
DM: This is an open story with open and it can decide him how you did.
DM: This is an open story with open and it can decide him how you did.
Video: Gold, cat.
DM: The last example I have time to show you is a tool, made of recently, to sample and executing music.
is a tool, I realized that recently, we have recently done for sampion;
The Sifty here are acting from sounds like base, low-bacteria and bacteria
Each one of these has four different variations, and you can choose what to use.
You can put these sounds in a sequence that you can get to your pleasure.
And you just modify it by just making a sound and a "sequence."
These are actually actually you can control from the alive, like reverberation and the filter.
You attack it to a particular sound and then including it up.
And then there are the general as time and volume, that you apply to the whole sequence.
We look at how it works.
DM: DM: We will start putting one base in two Siftable "sequencing," we stand in a seriously, we extend to the other bas.
I'm just going to put a line of bunch line.
DM: DM: Now I add percent of the ...
DM: And now I'll put the filter to the bacteria, so I can control the living living here.
DM: I can fast the whole sequence with the time from one or the other.
DM: And now I'm add the filter to the lower at the lower to expression.
DM: I can recombinate the sequence "voles."
So I don't have to plan it before, but I can improvise, making longer longer or longer corn.
And now, finally, I can turn the whole whole thing by the left the Siftable to the Siftable "volume."
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is to build new interfaces new man-machine interfaces more like how our brain and the body and body.
And today, I had time to show you one of the results of this lose and some possibilities that we try to bring out from the laboratory.
The concept I want to transmitate is that it's coming this new generation of objects designed to interact with digital media in our world in the way we want.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the time to talk to all of you.
I'm a writer.
From books is my profession but it's more than that, of course,
It's also love and the fold's of my life.
And I don't expect that it can change.
But I said that, something particularly happened in my life and my career, who brought me up to the whole relationship with this work.
The particular thing is I recently recently wrote this book, this biography called "Mangia, Prega, Prega, Amax, the while, diversely from my precedent books, for some reason that it used in the world and became a great conversational.
And the result is that everywhere in the time is that they are being convicted as if I was conviction.
It's true -- convicted convicata!
They come from me to all over and they say, "You can't afraid to do it for a better than doing it?
You don't keep keep writing for all the life without having more to be able to create a book that can care anymore?"
that can care of someone one?"
It's rassicuring it, you know.
But it could go worse -- part of that I remember that over 20 years ago, when I started to say people -- I was a adolescent -- I wanted to be a writing.
I wish I met at the same based on the fear.
And people were saying to me, "You can't have successful?
You don't fear that hummmmultiple refute kill?
You don't afraid to do this mestock for all life without anything that is ever out and die of a bank bank with your mestone bank with your mouth bank to love with failing cenergy.
So, you know that.
The answer -- the short response to all these questions is, "I."
I afraid of all those things.
I always had fear.
And I have fear of many other things that people can't guess it.
As you get up and other things share up with that.
But as it was about the writing what I thought and I was asking for the because, right?
Is it rational?
It's logical that anyone who should be waiting for being frightened by a job that you feel born to do it.
But what is there so particular creative in the creative imprese creative to make us nervous health.
As my father, for example, he was a chemistry and I don't remember one time in his 40 years of activity where he was asked if he was afraid to be engineer to be engineer to be?
It was never -- that block of engineer John, how is it does?
It wasn't working, you know, it wasn't going to work.
Onestly, chemistry engineers like group didn't have to be alcoholed in the sites, gen reputation of being alcolized.
We writers -- we have enough this reputation, and not only writers but creatives of any generally, we have this reputation of being enormously instable,
And it is not going to look at the content of the magnifies of the magnificent minds of the magnificent minds of the magnificent century, they die younger and often their own people.
And even those who are not suicide seem to be actually disded by their womens.
Norman Mailer, before I die in the last interview said, "Of my book has been killed a little bit of a little bit more." It's about the work of their life.
But we don't dry bate when we hear it because we heard about why we have these things that so long that we completely interiorized and accepted the notion of creativity and suffering, and the art, at the end, at the end, at the end, will be a few years of the bones.
And the question I want to leave all about today is you know, are you going to this ideas?
You can get this thing -- because you look at a distance of distance at all.
I think it's odious.
And I think it's also dangerous and I don't want to see the perpetuate in the next century.
I think it's better to encourage our great minds to live.
And I know that in my case -- in my situation in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to start out to be support to the constantly supply the circumstances that I'm in my career.
Of course -- I'm pretty young, I am a pretty young, I have about 40 years.
I still have about four decades of work in me.
And it's very likely to do now in the world as the world as the world as the work that came out of the world as the work that came after the last book.
I'm going to be slavery, because we're all more or less friends here -- it's likely to my shoulder.
Oh, Gesus who think!
You know, this is the kind of thought that leads a person to start bing in the morning and I don't want to do it.
I would keep doing this work that we do.
So, the question becomes like, right?
And so I always always reflective that the way to work and write that the way to work on the way to create a performance that I think of a performance, right?
I have to somehow to find a security of safety between me, that I'm writing and my natural ethic will be able models on what it will be able models on how to do I start looking through time, trying to find other societies to see if they could have the best ideas that you could have the best ideas and healthy healthy ideas and healthy healthy ideas more healthy ideas and healthy healthy healthy ideas
how to help people create creative people to run the inerent emotional risks of the creativity.
And that research led me to ancient Greee and ancient Rome.
See it because it goes back in circle and then back in.
In ancient Grece and ancient Rome -- people didn't seem to believe that creativity -- people didn't seem to be that creativity -- OK?
It was thought that creativity was this spirit and he came up and that came to the men from a few disorder, and unknown and unknown and unknown and unknown to it.
The Greeks called these spirits dynamed "demony."
Socrat, wonderful, he believed to have a demon that hearded elder,
The Romans were the same idea, but they called that kind of spirit without a genius of spirit a genius
Which is great, because Romans didn't think that a genius was really really a genius was a particular smart.
They believed that a genius was this kind of divine that was actually living in the walls of an artist, a little like the Dobby, and who came out of the artical article of an artist, a little bit like the elfo of the artick, and then the outcome of that work.
There is an acaded, there is the distance of what I talk -- that psychological costruck that protects you from the results of your work.
And everybody knew that it was so that it was so that it worked, right?
So the ancient artists were protts from certain things, like for example too narcisssysm, right?
If your work was an exception you couldn't take all the things all of the deep that they were helped by this genius.
If your work fail, it wasn't all of your work -- right?
Everybody knew that it was your genius to be a incapable of it.
And so people have been designed the creativity in the Octudent for a long time.
Then the Rinaiss; then the reader this great idea; we put the human being at the center of the universe over all the and mysteries without more to leave space to creatures that write details in divinity.
This was the principle of the humanitional rational and people started to think that creativity from the idivid;
And for the first time in history, it started to referred to this or the artist like a rather than a person with a rather than a person with a genius.
And I have to tell you, I think it was a big error.
I think that allow someone to believe somebody a simple person to believe being like a recipient as the source and the source of all the mysteries of all the mysteries and eths is a responsibility for a responsibility to the human fragile that human.
It's like to ask someone to to ingoider the sun.
It deform distores completely the ego and create all these ingestiable ingestible expectations on performance.
And I think it was this pressure that I destroy the artists in the past 500 years.
And if this is true, and I think it is, the question becomes up, and it becomes it?
Can we do it different?
Maybe you go back to a much more ancient understanding of the relationship between humans and mystery mystery of the relationship.
Or maybe no.
We may not be able to cut 500 years of thinking about rational thinking in a 18 minutes.
And probably in the audience that you probably have people in the audience that it would be suspicties on the notion of the notion of the notion of the undary people are going to move on their projects.
I probably won't be all on this thing.
But the question I want to ask is -- why I would it?
Why don't you think about this way?
Because it has more sense of anything that I've ever heard to explain the exasperants of the creative process.
A process that as anyone who has ever been trying to do something -- therefore, basically, all here -- yeah, it doesn't really fit rationally.
And in fact, it can sometimes be completely paranormal.
I did this recent recently with the remarkable poetc. Ruth Stone that has now 90 years, but that was a poet-all life and said in his childhood, in in the rural Virginia, he was working out in the fields, and he felt it in the fields, and he felt it in the fields, when a poem came out of landscape.
He said it was like a fragorous training trended.
And it was rolling up to stand back to her own landscape.
He felt it was going to get it to get the land under his feet.
He knew it was to have one thing to do to that point and it was to be able to run out of the morn."
And so it was going to house and it was going to be injury from this poem, and he didn't have to take a piece of paper and a match pretty quickly as the traffee and grab it on the page.
Sometimes he couldn't be fast enough, so correct and runs without getting and running out and the poem without getting to the house and the poem was going to continue to roll through the landscape and she would continue to roll through the landscape, as he said, "another poet."
Then there were the time -- this piece I never will not forget -- there were moments where the was almost lost of moments where the was almost lost or right?
So, he was running at home and was trying to card and the poem was going to go across and grabbed a match right in the while she was passing, and then he was like to get up with the other hand, and the steel and the steel off.
He was offered the poem from the tail and retained it in his body and turned it on the page.
And in these cases, the poem would be on the perfect page, and intact on the last word at the last word at the last word at the last word at the first word at the first word at the first word at the first word at the last word of the first word at the last word of the first word at the first word at the first word at the first word at the first word at the first word to the first one of the last word at the first time.
So when I felt it -- it's crazy, it's exactly the same as the creative process.
Not all my creative process -- I'm not a conduct!
I'm a mulum, and my way to work is, I am a bone-day and stand up and go and work and go over and go over the drops.
But even in my own id, I stood on my head, I strowed against that thing, at a time.
And I guess that many of you have the han it.
You know, even though work and ideas came from a certain source of a certain source I couldn't honestly knowing it.
And what is this thing?
And how can we relate to us to not lose your head -- but pluttoster, stay it?
For me, the best example of me -- the best contemporary example that I have is the musician musician in different years ago for a day.
We were talking about this, and you know, Tom, for the most of life was the incarnation of the artist in the article in contemporary art, trying to control these species of creatives of totally interiorate these totally interiorated species,
But then I got up there, and a day while she was driving on on one day in Los Angeles, changed all of him.
He was going fast, and all of a very little baby of this melodia, that comes in his head as it does the inspiration, elusive, and allies, you know, it is wonderful, and the wish -- you know, it's wonderful, and the wish -- but not as you take it.
It has no card piece of card, it has no mark, it has a recorder.
So it starts to hear this sort of old anxiety to him up, "I'm going to lose and remark with this song lost area, and I'm going to remark with this song lost area.
I don't have enough and I can't do it."
And instead of going to the pania, he stop.
I'll do the whole process and did something completely new about it.
He just looked at the sky and said, "Hey, don't see what I'm driving here?"
"Do you seem to write a song now?
If you really want to exist, it comes back in a more opposing when I can take care of you.
Otherment, you go to to to care anyone else today.
You go to disturbing Leonard Cohen."
And his work process changed after that.
Not the work, the work even as well as we always as a seed:
But the process, and the fish that was released when the genius was released when the genius, the genius that it was causing nentertaining it back where it was coming from, and it was going to be in the way that it was not to be an interior in the torent and torent on the torent of the torent and torent of torent that was caught and torent it as it was going to be released and torent it
But yet this peculiar bizarre column a conversation between Tom and this strange thing that was not Tom.
So how much I felt that story started to change a little bit the way I work and already rescued me and already save me a time.
This idea, I save me when I was writing "Mangia, Prega, Amaa," and you fall in one of the disperation where we all all when we're working on something and we don't start to think that it's going to be a disaster, that what will be the worst book never never written it.
Not just bad at the worst book written --
And I started thinking about throwing this project.
But then I reminded Tom who was talking to the air and trial.
So I stood up my face on the handy and I'd say my comments at a vacuum, and I would like a room
And I said, "Look, "Look, what we have to be brilliant will not be brilliant to mind, right?
Because how you see that I'm putting all of what I have, I don't have any more than that.
So if you want to be better, you have to introduce and do your part.
OK, but if you don't do you do know it, I don't do anything.
I'm going to go to write the same because it's my work.
And I would like to do this was recorded that I was now in my own own particularly -- because it turns out to do my own particularly -- centuries in North Africa of the North Africa in the North Africa in the North Africa who were dances at the walk and dances that were to hour and the walk up to the walk and hours to the walk up to the walk and the alk.
And they were always magnificent because the dancers were professionals, and they were fantastic.
But every single rary, rarally, something happened and one of these artists became actually translending.
And I know what I talk about what I talk, because I know that you have a certain point, a performance like this.
It was like the time stops and the dance walk through a kind of portal and wouldn't be doing nothing differently from the sun, like 1,000 nights before, but everything comes up.
And suddenly it didn't just look like a human being.
But it turned into the divince and detail in in the fire of divinity.
And when this happens, the time this was the people knew what he was, they were -- they called it with his name.
They used to go and start singing up, "Allah, Allah, Allah, God God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God."
That's God, you know.
Curious known -- when the More invasis on the Spainting of the Spain, they took this habits with their and ready to changed in the centuries from "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah,"
In Spain, when a artist has made something impossible and magic "Allah, Look, Allah, magnifia, you know, this is a lovely -- a lovely die of God.
And it's great because we need.
But the problem comes the next day later, for the ballerin the morning when you wake up and find that are the 11 o'clock of Martedn and the last of God is not more.
It's just a dead with great death, and perhaps it will never be able to be more to that alteach at that height.
And maybe nobody will be going to be the name of God still while yet, and so does have to do with the rest of his life?
It's difficult.
This is one of the most painful reconciliations.
But perhaps not have to be so angoating, if you can not believe that, in fact, the most extraordinary aspects of your being being being being being from yourself.
But it just believes that there are data in the pristely from a imaginable imaginable of this squisite part of your life that you have to go to someone else when you go.
And you know, if we think in this whole way.
And so I started thinking about it, and it's certainly as I thought about it for different months during the work of the book that I will be in the audience that I will presterate the following of my great success.
And what I have to keep telling me when I feel electrized from this is, not fear.
Let me just go to your work.
He keeps presenting for your side, whatever it can be.
If your work is dance, bally.
If the divine, I assigned you assigned you decided to leave it on leaves of leaves of a wonderful time through your efs, then "Oh her!"
Otherment, you do the same dance.
And "He!" to yourself.
I think I think I should teach it.
"He!" to yourself, even for having had human and tests and tests and tests aggen talks to give you continue to introduce all the time.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: O!
As you know I've been talking about some of these projects on the genome on the human genome of genes.
Now we're starting a new percorso: we started to type with biology and now starting from that digital code and now from that digital code and synthesizing life.
We always tried to ask for the big questions.
"What is the life?" is something that many biologists I think we have trying to figure out out how many levels.
We tried different approaches, reducing it to minimes to minimes
We're typically 20 years ormay.
When we sequenced the human genome was treated to go from the world of biology in the digital world.
Now we ask our: can we regenerate life, or create new life from this universe from this digital universe on this digital universe as this universe digital universe from this universe to the digital universe from this universe digital universe from this universe to the digital universe from this universe to the digital life.
This is the map of a small organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, which is the species from the genome between what they can self-horsplicate in the laboratory.
And we tried to reduce the genome to create one even smaller.
We can get a hundred genes of the genes of about 500 genes of about 500 that are here.
But when we look at the metabolic map is relatively simple than the note.
Believe credit this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can remove -- one at the time, is very unlikely to a living cell.
So we decided that the only way to make it synthesize this chroundary so that we could get the covery that we could modify the component to bring some of these fundamental questions.
And so we started the adventure of the "Can we can synthesize a chromosound?"
Can chemistry to make these great molecules that we never did it make them before there?
And in a deal case, can we make a chromosound?
A chromosome, is just a piece of chemistry of chemistry in it.
The speed that we can type the life is growing up growing up to exponential ry.
Our ability to write the genetic code, aging the genetic code, aging progression to be a rather slowly slowly, but it's getting better.
And our most recent results are exponential curve.
We started over 15 years ago.
The process has required a lot of the past of the process before we started the first experiments.
But we found that synthesize DNA is very difficult.
There are tens of thousands of cars in the world that produce little segments of DNA, the long 30 to 50 bear and it's a degenerative proced: the most segment is longer, more segment is longer, more selected to the world that are there.
So we had to develop a new method, and we had to develop these fragments and correct the mistake the errors.
And this was our first attempt to start with Phi from Phi 174.
It's a little virus that kills bacteria kills.
We designed the fragments, effective the report of errors and got a molecules of DNA of about 5,000 letter --
The interesting part of it is when we took this piece of chemistry and we put it in the bacteria started reading this genetic code and we put it on the bacteria particles and producing the virals.
The virals have been released by cells, they went back and they distruck the Es.
I talked about recent with the petrole-match of the petrole-who certainly understood that they certainly understood this model.
They have more than you.
We believe that this is a situation where the software can actually build his hardware in a biological system.
But we wanted to do things bigger things.
We wanted to build the entire chromosome.
It's about 580 miles lyer of genetic code --
So we thought we build it in the size of the viruses of the size of viruses, so that we can change the blood of a living cell.
The design is crucial and if we start with digital information in a computer, these must be very accurated.
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995, the standard accurate was a mistake for every 10 mile measures
We found out, 30 mistake it up, 30 mistake it out, 30 mistake it would not be able to do it.
A part of the process is designing long segments that are length with all the other segments to build smaller segments that are smaller than they can build smaller underunits that work together.
We try to join one here.
You probably have a little bit of the we put up in the end of the grain.
Think of this is we have a genetic code based on four letters: A, C, Gs and T.
Three of those letters together about 20 lovely loving about 20 acacids, and there's one specific orss of reading for every amminods.
So we can use the genetic code to write words, you think, fraish, thought.
What we did at the beginning was self-self-interesting.
Some of them have been dolphins from the fact that it wasn't poem.
We designed these sat these slands to joined with encies.
There are enzymes that are and put them and put them ahead and put them away.
And we started assembling of stars, starting with segments from five to seven miles letter to a 24 letter to a 24 miles llletter ones, they were to get to 72 letter up.
We spend all pass have produced these chunks in the abundance that we are trying to create a very robate proception -- as you will see in a minute.
We're trying to automatize the process.
So, this seems like the tabellon a basketer of a job player
When we get these very long, much longer cheap segments are going to be directly in E.
You get to the limits of the modern tools of molecular biology.
So we looked at other mechanisms.
We knew one more mechanism called recombination recombination of homology, which in biology is useful to repair the DNA to unimagazines the DNA to joined the channel.
Here's an example.
This organism called Deinococcus radioduce radiation. It can absorbed three million rads of radiation.
You can see in the upper square like his chromosome, you can be destroyed by the soul of the upper square in the upper square of the upper square in the upper square you to see in the upper square you to see in the upper square in the upper squared of the upper squeeeeeal
In 12 -- 24 hours comes assembled exactly how it was before.
There are thousands of organisms that have been able to do it.
These organisms can be completely.
They can live under empty.
I'm absolutely absolutely sure life exists in space, and you move to find new rich environments.
NASA showed that this happened.
This is an image of the molecules that we built using these processip-just using procession of the design of the sat at inserious design of chunk sites.
The lights carachievement.
This image wasn't taken with an electron microscope with an electron microscope -- but with a regular microscope --
It's a molecule so that we can see with a slightly slightly microscope of slightly slightly microscope
These are pictures that cover a period of about six seconds.
This is the publishing we did a little time ago.
It's about 580,000 letters of genetic code.
It's the biggest molecule of a defined structure that ever created by the man.
It's got a molecular weight to 300 million people.
If we spent it with a 10-unlike paper for no spaces, it would take 142 pages to turn this genetic code to turn this genetic code.
Now, how do we work work? How can we activate it?
Of course, you get a virus is a game by a guy play.
It's a little bit more complicated when they use bacteria as they use bacteria
It's simpler even when it's eukaryotic cells like our -- you can just extracted nuclear and put another one that is basically the clonelong, which is basically the clonelongy.
In the bacteria archaea is integrated inside the cell and we recently demonstrated that we can do a complete train of a chroplant from a cell to another and to another and to a different activity of activity.
We purified a party chrounk from a microbial special species.
The two are the two different as men from the tpis.
We added some kind of more in a way that we can decide what to choose,
The then brought with enzymes so that you have to kill all the proteins.
And when we put it in the cell was stupending -- and you will open our graph the new sophisticato's mobile -- the new chromosome, he went inside the cell.
And we were starting that we couldn't go to that three, but we tried it more to get us more in there.
This is one of the greatest mechanism of evolution.
We found that a very large species have added a second or a third chromosome, I add in a second thousands of new tracks to that species.
So who think about evolution like a gene only gene at the time you have no great part of the biology.
There are enzymes called "restrictions of restriction that even digesting DNA.
The chromosomes that it was in the cell of it has no one.
The cella-the chrosome that we have inserito--tail ha.
It was expressed, and he recognized the other chromosome, and we found it and the new rauned, and we were found with just the cell and the new chromo.
It became blue because of the genes that we have insert.
And in a short of time, all the characteristics of one species have been lost lost and moved around a new species, based on the new software that we put in the cell.
All the proteins have changed, membranes have changed, and when we read the genetic code is the same as we moved to you.
Now, this may seem to genetic alchemics, but we can change the things in a pretty substantial fly chemicals.
Now, I explained that there is not about genesis -- but about three million and a half of evolution, and I said that we maybe to create a new version of Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosion process.
Why do I do that?
I think it's obvious, I think of our needs.
We're going to spend six and a half billion people in the next 40 years.
Just to give an example: I was born in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for each existing in 1946; 40 years, there will be four years, there will be four years, there will be four years, there will be four years of it.
We're going to find food, fresh and cleaning and clean medicinal and drugs for six and a half billion people.
It's going to be even harder to do it for nine billion.
We use more five billion of carbon than 30 billion of oil barrels.
That means a hundred million barrels a day.
When we try to find biological processes or any kind of process to replace them to replace them up, it's a huge challenge to it.
We have to hold all the time of the CO2 from these materials that end up in the atmosphere.
On today today because of the scientific discoveries around the world around the world, we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I like to think that they are designed for the future.
The electronic industry has only one dozen about component -- and think about how many different things have come out of it.
Our limits here are principles of biological reality, and our imagination.
Now we have some techniques to these synthesization, can create what we call combinatory genomics combinatory that we call combinatory genomics.
We can build a big robot, robots that can produce a million chromosomes a day.
Think of procedure these 20 million genes of different genes of trying to optimize the processes to produce either either vaccines, we can change through a little team, and create more molecular biology that now over the last 20 years of science.
And it's just a standard selection selection.
We can choose for chance to survive, production of chemistry or carbon vaccines.
This is an instant of some software programs that we're working on for being able to sit and design species at the computer.
Well, we don't need to be like this.
We know exactly what their genetic code --
Now we're focusing on the fourth of the fourth generation.
You've seen ethanol-to-free was an experiment was a badly experiment finally experiment.
We have charcoal carbon on on on the third generation that will be going to be higher than the higher than the optan or different kinds of throw or different kinds of throwing the butternal kinds of throwing --
But the only way biology can have a great impact without increasing increasing the impact of the food and limiting the conversation of the divil aving the deal. And we are working on for designing cells that we work for designing cells that we can reach this purpose, and we can get this purpose, and we think we can get the first carbon on on on on about 18 months.
The sunlight combined with CO2 is a methodo, but in our discoveries around the world, we found different methods.
This is an organism that we described in 1996.
It lives in the deep, about 2,500 feet of deep water.
It creates from CO2 using hydrogen molecular hydrogen molecular hydrogen energy.
We're trying to figure out if we can meet CO2, which can easily be transported by tubes, converting that CO2 in order to drive this process.
So short we think we can be able to increase what the basic question of what the basic question is, what the basic question is, that is Noi, replacing -- we have the goal of replacing the whole industry.
Exactly. If you can't do it from TED, where you can it?
It would become a main source of energy.
And so we're working on to use the same methods to create the instantaneous bodies to create the instantant vaccines.
You've seen this year with the influence, we're always behind a year and a dollar in less when it comes to find the right vaccine.
I think that what you can change by building combinable vaccines in anticipate in anticipate.
This is how the future could start to look like changing, now, the tree of evolution, accelerating evolution, with bacteria and archaeukarian cells, archaeucariots.
We're so much from the way to improve people.
Our purpose is to make a long time to try and make a long time to try to do it a very much.
First of all I'm going to see the most rapidly possible, some fundamental work, the new technology that we brought Microsoft in a nearly year awarening. This is Seadragon.
It's an environmental environment, which you can interact with both local levels of visual data in a huge amount of visual data
Here we're seeing a lot of gigabytes, gigabytes, with a kind of a kind of a short zoom and continue, for a speed speeds like we want.
And it doesn't matter how big the amount of information that we see, how big the amount of information that we see, how big these data or images.
Most of them are digital photographs, but this is a scannor from the Biot, from the Biogic of Congress, and it rewalk into the legal of 300 megapixels.
It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that the predicts the prestations of a system like this is the number of pixels on your screen in any time. It's also very flexible architecture in any time. It's also very flexible architecture.
This is a whole book -- example of data doesn't imagines.
This is Dickens. Every coonal Casa chap.
And to show you that this is just about test, and not imagines, we can do something like this, to see really that it's a representation of the head, not a picture.
It could be a little artificial way to read an electronic book.
I don't adcommend it.
This is an example of the Guardian example of the Guardian.
Every great image is the beginning of a selection.
And it really gives you the pleasure of law the experience of reading the cardboard of a magazine or a fix, which is nature a lot of a half.
We also did something with the cornly of this number in the Guardian.
We created a high-resolution advertising -- much more than what you use in a normal normal publishing -- and we put you in a normal content content of extrade.
If you want to see the characteristic of this automobile, you can see here.
Or other models, or even specific specific techniques.
And this really shows some of these ideas to get the limits of space on the screen.
We hope that this lady putting to the pop-up to the pop-up and some other similar, not to be necessary.
Of course, the map is one of the obvious applications for this kind of technology.
And I don't want to lose time, if I don't want to lose time, if I don't say that we have contributed to the field of this field.
These are all the roads in the U.S. in the U.S. image of the NASA geospace of NASA
So now we're going to go to something else.
This is actually actually actually from the living on the web; you can go and see it.
This is a project called Photosynth, that fighting two different technologies.
A is Seadragon and the other is a very interesting visual computer at Noah Snavely, a student from Washington, with Steve Seitz of Washington, with Steve Seitz of the UW and Research Szski of Microsoft Research. A very good collaboration.
And it's living on the web, I was running from Seadragon.
You can see it when we do this kind of screening, where we can move from one on one and having this kind of experience of the other kind of experience to multiply.
But the space collocal of images here actually has a meaning.
The visualization algorithms of computer have recorded these pictures together, so that they correspond to the real places, so that you can imagine that you can store the lakes -- all the close to the laagain Grassi on Montagne Rockssi -- you can see the elements of a stable slide-stable slide-stable slide-stable things are all connected to space.
I don't know if I have time to show you some other environment.
There are some of them much more space.
I want to spend a remarkable data from the Noah's original data, this is from a previous prototype of Photosynth that we did for the first time last summer, just to show what I think is really the key thing I think is really the key to the environment, Photosynth of the environment, Photosynth of the environments that we put in the web.
We had to worry about legal aspects and so forth.
This is a reconstruction of Notre Dame images Flickr. Basta digital reconstruction from Flickr. Basta digital makern in makets, other of the campyckets, and you get pictures of these arances around. Every single imagined that it has been discovered to this model.
So they're all plug pictures was all taken from Flickr and were all linked to this way.
And you can get to navigate in this simple way,
You know, I never would end working for Microsoft.
It's very free to get this kind of acvalizing here.
I think you can see that it's a lot of different types of fotocococcurs in those Mcell in the SLR, a number of meaningful number, it would put together in this environment.
And if I can do that, I try to look for those older --
Many are block; so it was stuck with it.
Something here is a series of photographs -- there it is there there -- there it is.
This is a poster Notreal, Dame First Freef Freef of the Notred.
We can spend from physics to physics of this environment.
The essential point is that we can do things with the social environment. This is now taking data from everyone from the whole collective of how to appear the Earth, from the perspective.
All of those pictures become related together, greater than the parts.
You've got a model of the entire emerge.
Think about this as a promoging Stephen Lawler on Earth virtual Earth.
It's something that grows in complexity as people are using it, and the advantages for those who uses the use.
Their pictures are marked with metadhitting by other people.
If you get the idea of deliver tells all these things that are telling the name, my photographer of Notther Dame suddenly cut up all those dates, and I can use it as a dot point of all those dates, and I can use as a picture of not, and you can get a few of them, and having a social experience of the type of red types of the type of red model from the cross-mode and cross-wim experience of cross-mode of the kind of cutter-cuttate experience.
Of course, a consequence of all these are models of all interesting models of every interesting part of the earth of the earth, crops of the earth, collective only views, and satellite images and satellite images.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I understand good? What your software will have to do is that at a certain point, in the next years, all of the photographs of the pictures of everyone in the world will be practically connected together?
AA: Yeah. What is doing is doing basically it turns out,
It's creating hyperlink, if you want to be a pictures.
And it's doing it in the bottom of the images.
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about wealthy of the many of these pictures are that many of these pictures are going to be seen.
As you do a research of pictures on the Web and the text on the page of the web has a lot of information about pictures of the picture.
Now, what happens if that picture you connect to all your picture?
So the amount of semant interconnection and the amount of wealth that comes to is really enormous of it. It's a classical classical effect. It's a classical classical effect of the network.
CA: Blaise, it's really incredible.
AA: Thank you very much.
One of the pleasant pleasure when you travel and one of the innographic research is the way that has not forgotten the antic of the traditions, between who are in the wind, the passed in the wind, the stone of the today, the guns in the waves of plants.
You know, you know, the Homay, we still travel the Way, or that the myths of the elder, or that the myths of meaning, or that in Himalayaya, the budges are still going to the breathing about the Dharm of the Dharm of Dharm of the Dharm of the Dharm of the Dharm of the Dharm of the Dharm -- are not in a sense of reality,
the following of a particular set of adaptative choices that our stype has done, many generations ago.
And of course, we all share of the essential tracts.
We all hidden it.
We are subject to get initiation.
We have to deal with the inesority of death, so we don't surprise and drugs --
We all have an art.
What it hits is particularly the canzon, the dance of every culture.
It doesn't matter that they are the Penan forests or the Borneo, or the follows of Haiti, or Haiti, or the Kaid Wood's desert in Kenya secentries of the Curander's German or a Haitem in the heart of the Saa.
He was my journey of travel in the desert a month ago, or a tallevator of yaaths in the Qolanomolange, the desert in the world.
All of these people teach us that there are other ways of thinking about existing other ways of you can move in the world.
And if you reflect a minute, it's a concept that can give you.
Inside, the cultures of the world are creating a spiritual of life and the cultural life that will have a spiritual and cultural that will be the planet as the well-be-like biosphizing biological biosphiron.
And you can think about this ran as a cultural eat, as an ethnoxfhere and you can define the naky of all the concepts, dreams, ideas, inspirations, ideas, inspirations, ideas, ideas, inspirations, ideas, inspirationally from the awareness.
Ethnosthnox, the great potrimony of humanity.
It's the symbol of what we're and what we can be in as as a kind of quisition.
And because biosphere has been quite consumed as much as it was so much as it was in the ethnos;
No biologist, for example, it would say that 50 percent of all the species was or on the eastern eat, because it's just a failed, or -- in the ipots of biological diversity, and it doesn't get closesen as a pocalittic diversity -- that the cultural diversity of cultural diversity.
The indicates of this is, of course, loss language.
When you were born 6,000 languages on this planet.
A language is not only compost from a vocabulary or from a series of gramermers grammarly a series of grammarly program.
A language is the price of the human spirit --
It's the way that animation of every culture.
Every language is a forest of mind, a soul of the mind, a ecosystem opportunity to be a spiritual chance of spiritual possibility.
And of those 6,000 languages, while we're sitting in Monterey, at least half of the time is not more ssurrying in the children.
They don't get to be teacher, which means to say, unless you get to a be, unless you get to do something, which is already died.
What is more sad of the most sad to be available to be the last talk a language, of not having a way to transmit the wisdom of address or to anticipate the promise of children?
This horrying in a few part of the world every two weeks of the world every two weeks a lense and leads with the bottoms and the last few weeks of an ancient language.
And I know somebody to say "Isn't that better like this is?
The world would not be a better place if we were all yoruba. We talk all yoruba. We all yoruba. We talk about a lovely wone.
Let's talk about kogis.
You'll find a tract thing that means that we can't talk about their language.
I would like to do a journey through the ethnosfera;
a little journey in the ethnosphere that we are lost for.
Many of us forget that when I say, "different ways of existere" I mean very different ways.
We take for example this Barasana, in Sepentriony, in Sepentriony, the population of anaconda, that creates the people of anaconda, credate from the sidead rivers in snake, sacridding sacries.
It's a popular that it's not able to distinguishing the blue color, because the celests is identified in the forest, which depends the population.
They have a strange language and a marriage rule and a married, "exogamicistic ruths and a different language.
And all of this has roots in the mitological past, yet is that in these extremely extent families where they talk about six or seven languages of no one basically matrimonstring is that in these familiar nobody language.
They are just just listen to and then start talking about.
We take one of the most interesting tribes with the most interesting tribe, Waorans of the Ecuador nordal, an incredible popular that had the first contact in 1958.
In 1957 mission had tried a contact with a facty mistakes.
They have made them out of the photographs that they would think of a lovely who thought of friendly that this population forest, forgoats that this rainforest, had never seen anything about biz-dimensional bi-dimensional rains.
They have been picked up the planet, they were looking at the research of a form or a shape or a shape, not find nowhere, they were killed that he was diavola, and they killed the fives.
But the Waorans didn't kill to be just the foreign --
They kill them in the way.
54 percent of the deaths was caused by their own themselves.
We are in eight generations and we found two of natural deaths and when we fed it to know -- they have a very aged knowledge that one of them was so aging that he died in aging -- and then they killed it himself.
The hunters were able to recognize the animal urine from 40 steps and recognize the species.
In the early '80s, I was assigned a really interesting task when my Harvard professor of Harvard was asked if I wanted to Haiti to go to Haiti to intrufolks and Tonton Macout, and Tonton Macoutes, and Tonton Macohites, and impose the Tonton Macout, and impoisons.
To make sense of my miracle I had to understand Voodoo culture and that the Voodoo isn't nera.
It's pretty much a metaphor complex.
Very interesting.
If I ask you to tell me the great religions of the world of the world that would I would say it?
Christian: Islam, Ebraism, Ebraism, etc.
A continent is always left out, thinking that sub-Saharan Africa has no religion has faiths. And instead of yes and the Voodoo is not that the distilled of these very profoundations of nated during the tragic dish.
What makes you interesting is that the voodor is the intense of life and death.
So you have the spirits.
The spirits can be invocated by the Grande Aqua, they respond to the dance of dance and they replace the way that for a short deal.
So this voodooisters like "You go to a white to talk about God.
We give it in the temple and we become God."
And from the moment that you are possing, is the spirit that drives you, how can you do that?
So you look at these incredible events. I follow voodoo in the truck of the trance that touch are uncomfortable uncomfortable of the mind of the mind of the mind when it was catalyzed in a state of extremely extreme to be remained in a state of extremely extreme as a remarkable event in the extreme of the extreme that you get in an extreme of extreme that are in an extreatment of the extreme that you
And in all the populations that I lived the most extraordinary of the Sierra Nevada Santa Marck's Mogi Santa Marckles.
The size of the ancient civilization that once once they were living on the careers that once they were living on the careers of the Colombia in the conquist, population would be retreated on the charbe.
In a drug continent of blood -- this popular has never been conquered by the spagnowling.
And at the today, they are governed by a cline but their formation is definitely extraordinary.
The young people follow from the family, three or four years, and they live in a secret in a world of good and shadow in the world of good and shake in the basis of the ice for 18 years.
Two period of nine years of proposited to reproduce the nine months of managation that spend in the uteration of the mother, are now metaphorically in the uteration of Madre.
For this time, they are acculturated to the values of their company, values that they predate and only their prayers and only their praying manage -- or for the cosmic balance, or for the ecologic balance.
The end of this incredible initiation, they suddenly brought out and for the first time in the age of 18 years, they see an alba. And in that active of the first bold bages, when the sunsters the sun valles of the beautiful landscape is conference -- all that they learned in theory comes conference in all his own splender. The prey is a past behind the prey of the speeches. The prey past of this is a past of the paper,
"Right? I mean how I have detail.
It's amazing. Now it's going to protect it."
You call the greatest brothers and say that we, brother brother of the world in the world.
This level of intuition is extremely important.
When we think of India's populations and we invote Rousseau and the old story of the noble of the wildly noble history of the noble history or maybe we can invoe Thork's -- and we say these people are closer on Earth of us.
The Indian populations are not feeling or unsentimental sentences.
There is no space for these things in the malaric stage of the Asmat wins of Tibet, but because of the time and rits, they created a mystic of the Earth not about the concept of being consciously, but on an unction of the Earth doesn't have a very well more subtuned intuition of human consciousness,
What does that mean?
That means that a boy of the Ande of the Ande that grows is a spirit of a spirit that will be a foundly different and will be a very different way and will have a very different relationship and will have a drink with the mountain or that place on a young girl in Montana growing mountain is growing that grow is a loved.
which is the dimoral of a spirit or a little bit, is irrelevant to it.
What is interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between the individual world.
I grew up in the Columbia Britannica believing that the rainforests had to be cut.
That was a different human being being different from my friends Kwakiutl who believe that the forests are the Hukukukukuk and the beat the dunk of the paradic and the rugs spirits that live in the world north the world becomes north world, spirits that they face in the Hamatsa.
If you start to consider that these cultures can actually create different reality, you can start to understand some sense; you can start to understand some sense.
I took this picture to open this picture to open the nordocky.
Maybe some of you have heard about the ayahuase, the most powerful repertancy of the repertorio of the repertorio of the repertoria.
What makes a fascinating ayahuas's not the potential of the support of the support of the supply of the supply of the basements.
From a light, this lexian lea-carboline and harmine molinogeny and many, and hardly harmine and molinogeny.
And then you take the only plant one of the coffee that alters a little bit of the consciousness, but it's measured with the leaves of a coffee family, "The Photridis.
This plants plants trip to night very much like the serotonin, methoxyptamine-5, methoxyptamine-methoxyptamines.
If you ever see the Yanomami in the bird of the support that are a different set of species, I would also have met meet with species, I would anchoxydimethoxyptaminas.
Tirdating that polyer is a little bit like being disappeared by a fire of painting of board, boockles and land on a electricity. It doesn't create a distortion of the reality.
I was often with my professor, Richard Evan Shultes, the man who took the psychchoptical was a psychchopen, with his discovery, halling halls in the '30s in Mexico.
And so so I don't can be classify these triamine-to-to-wer because if you can't tell anyone to be hallucinated. But you can't be hallucinated.

Now it's the beauty: the coal beta-carbolin-carbolinband of the same kind of requires that are the same kind of need to potentiate triptamines. The question is spontane: in an 80,000 species of plants, how do these people find them two deadadadadult: not but if you combine in this way, they think about a biochemistrat, but if you combine in this way, they are they at the perior at at the perior at the superior at the sum of the superior at at at the sum of the sum of the part?
We use the great euphemism of proof of the proof error, that can revealing infrutty.
But if we ask Indians, they will tell us "Plants talks about it.
What does that mean?
This tribe, Cofan Cofan has 17 variety of ayahuas's distinguish, and that our eyes would come into the same species.
If you ask how they stabilize their pockets will tell us how to tell us how to be plants, of the rest I don't know everything?" I said, "No."
The solution is, you take the 17 variety in a night of the planet, and each one will be with a different tone.
With this not laurea at Harvard, but it's much more interesting than counting the stams.
Now, [As] the problem is that even those of us who have to heart the people who have to get them pay up with the margins of the history of our real world of history than our real world and pass it respect to the marges of our real world and passing it for it.
In fact, the X-century, 300 years, it will not be reminded for his wars or its technology, but rather like the age that we were stopped and we embracing the destruction of the planet and we have embracing the destruction of the planet. Now the problem is not change.
All cultures through the centuries have been involved in a dance for new life.
And the problem is not technology.
Indians have no way to be Sioux when they put from the ark and free free and free free as Americans don't have to be Americans when they put from the horse and heat.
It's not the change or technology that threatening the integrity of the ethnosfera. It's the power.

If we move on on the Tibet, where I'm doing many research, you will see the harvest of the political domination.
As you know the genocide -- the physical extinction of a popular popular -- but the device, the destruction of a population, not only conviction of a popular popular population, not only it's not convicted -- but celebrated in certain environments, because it makes part of the development.
And you can't understand the Tibet until you start to the beginning.
I spent the 6,000 miles from Chengdu in China in China in China in China in Lhasa young colleagues, but only arrived Lhasa young colleagues, but only arrived Lhasa young colleaguate in Lhasa that we hear about about it.
6,000 sacres are sacred in the pole and cenergy.

The great antiropologist Margaret Mead, before we die said his greatest fear of the world was that in our way to this lovel vision love -- not only we'll see the whole legal of the human imagination of the human imagination of the thinking, but a day we will wake from a dimental dimention of mindnarrying up until there there were other possibilities.

The modern industrialized world has 300 years.
That shark is not suggests that we have the answers to all the challenges that we should deal with the millennia.
When the culture of the world is asked what it means to be human, they respond to be human, they respond with 10,000 voices.
And it's in these answers that we all recommen: we all recommen: a kind of aware of that, a species, that must have to make all the people and all the gardens can true the gardens can true the whole of optimistic moments.
I took this picture of the north island from Baff, when I went to the Baff, when I went to the whale of the Inuit, and this man, Olayer was telling the wonderful story of his grandfathers.
The canadec government was not always gentlate with the Inuit and in the '50s to our premaintain colons.
The grandfather of this man refused to go out.
The family, temping for his life, brought all of his arms, and all of his attention to it.
You have to know that Inuit don't know the cool -- they exploited.
The slittles were made of the origin were made of the weight in the caribs.
The grandfather's grandfather had no intimit or the bylizartical or bylights that was suffering or byond or bylights that was not intiles.

where the wisdom of all the populations can contribute to our collective well-being
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book I hope to call other than other than you already heard and I'll try to turn some colleagues, in case not we notice them.
I want to start with what I call "the official dog."
The office?
The official dog's offices of all the Western industrial society is "If we want to be wealthy of our citizen."
The reason is is -- from a side, in the fact that freedom is in itself a value, is useful, useful, essential for human beings.
On the other one is that if we are free, each of us can act to do everything that male similarity to do everything that multimately as we can benefit with nobody knows that we know in the name of our.
The way to massize, the freedom is to be massized.
The more choices people are free, and the more than the freedom, more than they are freedom, more bad.
This is, I think it's so deeply rooted in the society that nobody would have dream to put it in the doubt.
And it's also deeply deeply deeply in our lives.
I'm going to show you some examples of what progress has made it possible.
This is my supermarket is not particularly great.
I lost a simple note on condition for insalate conditions.
In my supermarket are 175 conditions, without contting the 10 variety of the extrack of oil and the 12 balsames that you can buy you for a huge amount of condition of condition that nobody has been 75 ready to be an enormous numbers of concern is of your gradient ps.
This is what the supermarket is.
Then you go to the electric store to buy a stere: CD, radio, radio, plast, radio, plast, amplificator.
And in this single store, there's a great audio.
We can do six and a half million combination using the components that there are in one negotis of the negoti.
You have to admit that there is a lot of choice.
Other field: the world of communications.
One, when I was a child, they could get all the wished phones, to the pat that they were forming from mamma Bell.
He was known the phone doesn't buy it.
A consequence of that, in the way, it was that the phone is that the phone is not stolen.
These days, I'm going to be there.
We have a remarkable variety of telephones, especially between cellular cellular cellular phones.
Here's the cellular cellular cellular phones.
My favorite is that in the middle of the birth, MP3, cuts of the birth, and strines for the brule.
If you don't have seen it yet, you have still seen in the house, you're pretty well certain that will be going to get it.
And what the end is that people enter in the negows and ask this question. And you know what the answer is the answer is "No."
It's not possible to buy a cellular cellular phones.
So, in other aspects of life that are much more important than the water, you know, it means the same explosion of choices.
There is no healthcare -- no thing is going on in the United States that you go from the doctor and the doctor what you have to do.
Instead, you go to the doctor, and the doctor says, "OK, we could do A, or B, you know, you go to the benefits and these risk." "Be benefits and these risk."
You say, "Dr. Dr. What should I do to do about you?"
And the doctor says, "A wishes and these risks: "Buts and these risk."
"What do you want to do about that?"
And you can rebat if she was me, what do you do?"
And the doctor: "But I'm not leed."
The result of the malato," expressure that it makes it a beautiful thing.
But it actually isn't that a fish and the responsibility for some of the decision-making decisions from someone who knows something, which is not knowing nothing -- and almost certainly it's sick; and so it doesn't know about that that is not in the ideal condition, to make the actual decision-the patient decision-making.
There is an enormous marketing of drugs, direct people like me and you, if you think of it doesn't have any sense, you can't buy them.
But if we can't buy them, why are they public?
The answer is that they want to doctor called the doctor to ask for us to change the receive to change the received.
So what we have to be so fundamental is our identity is a question of choice, as you see in this vigyp; we don't want to force. We don't want to be babies. We don't want to be a identity."
And we can reinventing how many times we can reinvent.
That means that every morning at the risky, you have to decide that kind of person wants to be.
I receive to the family, a time the perspective of the community of the local perspective, almost for anyone to anybody, and it was going to start the most presterated.
The only real choice was with while, not when I don't even fit to do later.
Over the day, all is really to play it.
I think I smart at very smart and I do their 20 percent of work than a time.
And not because they're brilliant because they're less dilessing.
But why I'm implemented to ask you, "should I get marries or no? I should be able to do this now?"
"Would I be able to think before I got to think before the career or career?"
They're all sorts of logy.
And they try to answer these questions, even if this implementementing not completing the company, and not to get a good vote to my exame.
And they have to really ask it. It's important.
Now, the job: we're lucky, like Carl subolineavy, because technology allows us to work every single single day, from the planet, except from the planet, except from Hotel Randol.
And in the parents, there's a corner, and I don't tell anyone where where the WiFi works.
I don't say that because I want to use it.
What does this incredible freedom of choice that we have about work? It's that we have to continually decide -- and that we need to work or no.
We can go to the kid play, with the cell phone in one pocket in one pockets, and the notebook, typically, on the knee.
And even though they're all spells that we see our son to rovince the game, we're asking the doing, "Does I also say, "Does you call, "Whe?"
"Do I have to answer this email? I have to email?
And even when the answer is "no," all this makes the experience of your son was very different than your son was in other conditions.
So, from any part of the way, things and big things and style and big things and stiles of life, life is a choices.
On the world was this: Obo, there were some possibilities, but it was not a chance of choice.
The world today is the world today looks like this. The dilemma is, "Is it a positive, or negative thing?"
The answer is Supupsis.
The positive lights we all know -- so I'm going to talk about the negative sides.
And this is all this choice behaviors on the people.
The first paradoxically, is that producing paralysis, rather than free.
With many options between the options that it becomes very hard to do it.
I give you an significant example of the volunteer: a conducted depensionate of volunteer:
A colleague had access to the data from Vanguard, the gigantesacts of pension, with about a million clients of pleuged in 2,000 different companies.
What she found is that for every 10 solutions that are offered for every 10 solutions that are offered in the percentage of air.
With 50 sources of offeres, there's 10 percent in less than the deployment when they are available only 5. Why?
Because with 50 sources of what chooses, is very hard to decide and choice is to decide and the choice is remainly given to the questions.
And I still ask question, and I still ask question, and of course, the questions don't get it.
You know, not just that means not just that these old workers are going to be food because they won't have enough money, they don't want to say that decision is so obsticle funds of the complementary sources of the dator of the workers of the dator of the workers of the dator of the complementary data.
Not participating, they're losing to 5,000 dollars per year from the the dator of the workers of the workers of the workers that would be well willing to verse.
So the paralysis is a consequence of having too many choices.
And I think that makes the world like this.
"And finally, for the ethanketchup, senapes or mainion?"
You'd like to make the right decision, if it's for the eternity, right?
You don't want to choose the wrong and you don't want the wrong condition to the wrong condition
So this is the first effect. The second is that even if we can avoid paralysi, and we have a choice, at the end of how we would be staded with less options between less options between less options between which you choose to choose.
And this for several reasons.
One of these is that with a lot of conditions, you know, you can be able to imagine that if you buy one and it's not perfect -- it's easy to imagine that you could have been better choice that would be better than the alternative imagined us with the choice, and the remise of the choice, and the rempiant decreation decreation of the decision of the decision of the decision that decision is that you would be better than the decided.
even when it was a good decision.
More choices are easier to be easy so that you can detail than any detail, that is insoddisfacting.
Also, there is what economists call cost-opportunity.
DGG: Wake a very well stake stamtin as the value that we give things to the things that we confront them.
Del rest, when there are many options possible, is easy to represent the alternative characteristic of the alternative commodities that are choice.
Here's an example. I get with all the people that are not in New York.
But that's what you would probably think about it.
There's this copy to Hamptons.
A place of lusside.
Spill. Ottima day. It's all for them.
Not sent anything. But what he thinks is, "Well, maledibling is Agoing."
"All my nearly in Manhattan are alive.
"I could park right at home."
And he spends two weeks that idea that it's losing -- every day -- the chance of parking where you want.
The cost-opportunity to defenal soddisphation for what we have, even when the choice was excellent choice was excellent.
And the most of them are the options that we have to be considered, more the characteristic active are going to come back against opportunity.
Here's another example.
This is a lot of things that you can do that.
It talks about living the moment, and maybe of the living right now.
But the most important thing is that anything you choice, you know, you can be able to do not do the others.
The things that we don't choose to attract what we do.
Third point: the spiral growing of waiting.
I tried to buy a new jeans.
Since almost always jeans.
The jeans were of one typical type, you buy them and dress were besty, they were southeary, only after you took them a life and work a lot of times, they were doing good.
So, I went to buy a couple of new when the old people went and I said, "I need a couple of jeans, this is my tap.
The committed to me, "You want slim fit, folks relaxed up, relaxed fit, relaxed it?"
You want to look for a while, or with the bottonies?
"Who's you want?"
"Coto it wants or stretch or stretch -- you know, you walk like the blap --
I was stunked, and after a little bit I could say, "I want the guy -- that was the only one typical stage -- he didn't have what I was like to try to all the maleates, and then I went out from the snegotis to the negoti, with the best two of jeans I had ever had.
It was the male of it. With all that choice I had the bad.
But I felt the worse
Why? I wrote a book to understand it.
The reason I was I was worse is that with all that choice was all that choice was altising, the jeans had to be perfect.
I was expectations at least I didn't expect anything that was when there only one of the guy had to be perfect when there was one of 100 different different guessed had to be perfect.
What I had the purchase, but not perfect it.
After I had paragoned that I was inherently insoddisded in confronted.
The add of options in life of people don't make it increase the expectations that these have respect to the options of options itself.
And this will produce less soddisfation, even when the results are good.
No one in the world of marketing if it makes it.
Because if I know it, you wouldn't know what I'm talking about.
The truth looks more like this.
"It was better when it was worse when it was better when it was better when it was worse when it was worse that when it was worse that it was even able to meet some of the sources.
Over the world we live -- opulent intual initial inherent industrialized of the perfeation of the perfeation -- the most of the things are at the height of waiting.
You'll never have been surprised because because your expectations, my expectations, they were ingiant to be ungantites.
The secret of happiness -- what you're here -- is "Baseded" "Yes, you want it to you."
I mean, small moment -- small moment -- that I'm really married and my wife is really amazing.
I couldn't do better, I don't have a bunch of it.
But you get no always is a bad thing.
Finally, a consequence of buying a couple of jeans when there's only that jeans are that when you don't have satisfacts, and you ask you why. Why?
"Who is responsibling?" The answer is clear to that.
The world is responsible. What could I do about it?
When there are hundreds of jeans, and you buy one insoddisfacting, and you ask you who is responsible responsible responsible for you to be you.
You could have better be.
With hundreds of variety available -- there are no excuse for the insuccess.
So when people make decisions, even if the result is valid, they feel insoddisded, and they give the bad to their own itself.
In the last depression is exploded in the industrialized world.
I think a meaning -- not the only one -- but important -- of this depression of this depression is that people have deludent experiences because standards are too high.
And when they have to explain this situation they think that the guilty is them.
So the final result is that we're generally in general, we're all better, but we feel the worse of it.
Let me tell you about it.
This is the official dog; what we all take for good and it's completely failed.
There is no doubt that a little choice is better than a little choice is better than a little choice is better than a little choice is better than a little bit.
There's a critical value of critical. I don't know what it is.
But I'm sure we overcome from a piece of the piece of the way the choices improving our life.
Now, from political view, I almost ended -- I have almost finished -- from the political point of view, the nox, the noce, the nocle is the following.
What it allows all this choice in industrial society is the material.
There are many places in the world, and you know about the world is that they have too much choices.
The problem is they have too little bit.
So the way the factors I'm talking about is a mal-exclusive, being exclusive, rich society in the Western society.
And what he does to depress and angry is this: Steve Levitt told you about the constantly the constantly and seats seats are useless. It's a waste of money.
I mean, these choices, complicated and dispendioss, it's not just that they are inuseless.
I'm even deleteria.
They are worse in the worse of that.
If some of what in our society is allowing to a lot of choice was reverted in those where people have too much chance, it would not just be the way to improve improving but the noteens.
This is what economists call a paretyan improvement improvement.
A redistributation of the income is good for everyone -- not only to the poor -- because of this choice in excess that it would be torments.
Well conclud: "Freo, you can become all that you want,
You know, people of culture, they think about the fish, "What do that fish do?"
"It's obvious that you can't make anything in a vetrow."
"A imagination castred a limitation of the world."
and I was also interpreted that like this, at the beginning.
But then, I realized, I realized that that that fish the long way of it.
Because the reality of the fact is that if you sent the mouth, so that "everything is possible," you can't get freedom.
If you rop the meluged in a way that all the you can decrease the relief.
You get the paralysi, and you reduce the wealth.
Everybody needs a sphere.
This is almost certainly too closely too closed, perhaps even fish for us.
But the absence of some symbolic symbolic symbolicity -- I am of infelically, for the ruin and ruin the ruin --
Thank you for heart.
