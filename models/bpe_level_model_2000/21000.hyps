And the last year I showed these slide to show that the calculation glacial glacial glacial sizes of 48 percent of the United States of 40 percent of the 40 percent.
This is a little bit of this underlying the gravity of the problem because it doesn't show the beginning of the ice --
The climbed glacial climate is, in a sense, the heart of the climate system climatic.
You expands of inversus wind and the expand.
The next slide will be a couple of the last 25 years.
The ice loak is a result.
As you see the blue sanding up to the blue screen.
This is the ice in the wind, which is the glacier.
You can see that the cosid-called the glacium perennes, five years or more, is like the blood -- it's like the body skin the body.
In 25 years was passed from this, at the time --
This is a problem because the climate lands the Eartype of the art where there are huge quantity of carbon -- they have enormous foot that microbic methane.
Rispspring to the totality of the atmospheric atmosphere.
In some laghi deep in Alaska foot is already reboardinging from water.
The Alass Katey Walter the University of Alaska is recated team was recated with a team that was a team in the team of the University of the University of Alaska team of Alaska team of Alaska team of Alaska team of Alaska team of Alaska team is recated team is recded with a team
Video: Wow! Al Gore: She is the question. The question is if we're going to be also now.
A reason is that this exchange is that this exchange the Greenland the Greenlland from the north.
This is a glacial regims.
The taken he had never reached the similar levels.
This is the Kangerlusaq, in the so-in the so-in the Greenland Greenland
If you want to know how the level of the mand the gain us on earth, here is where you get the sea level of the sea level of the mare.
These are increasing increasing rapidly.
Another of the planet: Again, the biggest block of the planet.
The month, the scientists have declear that the balances of the ice is in negative, and that Antarctic Western in a few Western under the island.
Squival in six feet of water, as in Groenland.
He'Himalaya, the third largest block of ice block, you see new laghs, who was gaaced.
Four percent of the world population was going to be the rest of the glass of the mind of the gment.
One is the glacier is the background water of this city.
The bringing is increased.
But when you diminishes the same ack water in the water poor.
In California is the neve Sierra Nevada is diminutes of 40 percent.
The ydrills are in crisis.
The predictions, as you have level, are gravs.
The growth of the world door a remarkable news is going to be increasingly endeed.
The environmental disasters are increasing a recording out of the normal and without precedent.
Four times more numbers in the last 30 years of respect respect to 75.
This is a whole thing of insustainable to the insten.
If you look at the context if you can see the consequence.
In the last five years we added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the oceans every day.
Look at the East of the Pacificant, from the oriental Pacific, and on the west, and on the bottom parts of the continent in the oceans.
Most causes of global warming, together to the deforestation, which is 20 percent, is the using of the result of the real-to-climb.
Oil is a problem, and the carbon is a problem, and the carbon is even worst worst
The United States are one of the two countries, together.
And it turns out of the other central central central lots of other carbon the well.
But we're going to be a changing change.
These are the annulled projects in the last few years of green motors and some alternative versus of green alternative projects in the last years.
At every way, there's a politics in our country.
The carbon industry and oil industry have 250 million dollars in the last year to promove the carbon to promote the carbon and is a oxydead.
This image I reminded me to remind somethings.
Natmal in Natmal Tennessee, where I live was a 3.8 billion liths of carbon garbong.
Maybe you saw him on the news.
This is the second largest flow of scories in America.
It's happened around Natal.
The natalized natalized of one of the carbon industry.
Video: She is a bail, it's a ball, and happy.
It's abundant here in America, and it makes our economy.
Frosty the carbon is more and more and more clean.
It's about a good price, adorable, and the workers are hypen.
Al Gore: Do you have a little bit of the West Virginia.
The large society is Massey of the mountain is Massey Coal. This is his friend.
Video: Don Blank: I will be clear -- Al Gore, Nancy Pelogo, Harry Reid -- they don't know what they're talking about.
Al Gore: So the Proteon the Proteon of Clima has launched two pages.
This is a bunch of a part.
Video: All right, so that we are seeing the climate changes as a minm of climate in the business of our business.
So our priority is to invest a great amount of money in a audience of the audience, and confuses the truth and confuses the truth on the carbon of the carbon of the carbon of the carbon of the audience.
In fact, the carbon is not sport.
We think it's a good profum.
So not preocupatents of climate change.
Let me do you do now.
Video: All you know, I was talking about a lot of talking about a lot of talking about a lot of it.
So let's do a gyellow framework in a structure of the carbon is a clean.
Straordinary cars are a little romorose, but this is the sound of the technology of carbon technology.
The carbon is between the main of global warming, but the notice of global warming, but the notice of carbon that you see change.
You look at the eye: this is the technology of carbon technology.
Al Gore: Inded, the alternative positive is to economic and the national security and to that the national security of national security and the national security of the national security of the national security of economic security and the national security of economic
Video: M: The America, is in the economy, the economy, the national security climate crisis.
The film that the college all of the people, our dependence from the combustic combustic and the oil is and the oil oil and oil oil and the oil oil and oil oil is the clums and the oil clean to the clean the oil depen
Now, there's a new audition to use.
Butter, 100-percent energy energy, in diecket, in diecks.
They are a plan to be a working for America to work, and help to help the global warming.
Finally, a solution that basts to solve our problems.
By America. Scovering more.
Al Gore: This is the ultim.
Video: H: It's about America.
One of the faster ways to bring the end of the dependence from the combustic dependence to our planet.
Everything is here. I mean, it's just a new energy.
She looked at the wind investments for working well work.
M: Reat America. It's time to be realists.
Al Gore: A old African proverbio African is says, "If you want to go to speed to you, go from money.
If you want to go away together."
We have to go away to long.
Thank you very much.
The year last last TEDDDeefs in LHC.
And I try to get back to the way to get back to how the machine.
So here he was the other one once wasn't the other time -- the LHC is the biggest scientific experimented -- 27 kilometers of circumsters of circumstomer of circumsters.
Her became up with the conditions that were less than a billion digming billion second on the universe -- until 600 million times a second.
All of this is just the environment.
This is the car underneath Gineva.
We photographs these mini-Big Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Big Bang Bang Bang Big Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Big Bang Bang Bang Big Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang
This is what I work. It's called ATLAS -- is larger 44 feet and has a 22 feet in 22 feet in 22 feet of feet and has a 22 feet of meters.
This is a spectacular image of ATLATLAATLA, you can see the proportions.
First of the last year, we have the machine for the first time,
And this picture was taken by ATLAS.
It was because of immense festating in the control of the control of the control of the control of the control.
It's a picture of the first particles that had been in the LHC, ring in LHC, ring in collision, deliberately with a part of the LHC, and diffavoid particlevator.
In other words, when we see that image the 10 settember 10 sects, we realized that machines, which is a great life.
I don't know if it was to do that exult us to Google and he went to Google and saw that the page, and he saw the page, it was this one.
That means we had a cultural impact of the scientific impact that scientific impact.
About a week later, there was a problem with the machine, I had to these move movies -- these dorates -- these dorates.
These are 13,000 printing 13,000 printing the machine works in the power.
Now, technical technics between you look at files and say, "It's not true.
And it can do it because when I'm very fredless becomes cosids the surface.
So, at least 271 degrees, at a time time for the space, these movies can bring that corrent.
In one of the most of the magnets in the LHC, there was a defection of fabrication.
So the movies are going to read up the electrical and 13,000 printed and suddenly meet a resistance.
This was the result.
Now, this is still more impression if you think these magnets are about 20 tons than 20 tons -- and that came about 30 centimeters.
They are damaged about 50 magnets.
We had to take a tiny -- what we did we do it.
We have the rest of them and advanced.
They're going back back to all their under broad.
Entruth, the end of the LHC will be a new integry.
We will access it to get out of the data to get the data or gain or he did, and continue so our wind to find out what are the matter to find out what the universe.
Now, of course, in a certain the way, these class are relief the value of science and the engineering and engineering. It's easy to be confuture.
I think that the fact that it's so difficult to go beyond the limits, I think it's the value of things like LHC.
I would like to conclude with the words of a scientist, Humphrey Davy, which image, in defense of inuseful science of inuseful scientist, his pupill, his pupill, his pupill, "No is so dangerous is so dangerous, "No is so dangerous to the science of human mind as wells us that are not going to be completely in nature, and not in nature of us to be completed, and the mone."
Thank you.
I want to start asking you to get to rethink about this -- to a children, you get coins.
And as you understand how you get them and realize them and realize them and move them and move them and resolve them and resolve problems.
The space is deeply is deeply to the way we understand the world around us.
So, as informed inspired by using the half of our interaction with physics, together, and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanith, I started asked myself, I started to ask mouse as a computer, instead of the mouse as policy as well-digital clubs as well-digital to be information with a lot of information with a lot of the hands,
and we will do it in our please?
The question was so interesting that we decided we would explore the answer, building Siftable.
In poor, a Sifty is a whole computer computer is a big computer computer computer computer is a cool beautiful.
In poor, a Sifty is a whole computer computer is a big computer computer computer computer is a cool beautiful.
And you can move it with the hand, they can see the right now, I feel the movement and have a wireless.
But more than that, I'm physics, as the morning, as the morning, you can move on the morning.
Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem of instruments to manipulate the digital information.
And as they become more physics, and as a flight of the right -- the others, and as they become more physics, and as the others, and as we know about others, as we can explore and others, as we can explore new and different stilds of interaction.
I'm going to start with some simple example.
This Siftable is configured to show the video -- if you including the video -- the video is going to go back to the other part of the other parts of the other other hand.
These are interactive ritriteries are consciouss.
If they are interesting them in what they are going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be in the face.
If they come circumstom, and they can get a little bit of a little bit of it.
If they come circumstom, and they can get a little bit of a little bit of it.
They also have their movement and incline.
And then we realized that one of the interesting employers of the interaction was the powerful way to the data as if it was a liquiet.
In this case, we have three Siftable configurated as seckets and I can use them for the color, where they missing them in the central central where they missing.
and I can use them for the color, where they mix in the central central central of the color.
If we really get too much of it, we can reput a little bit of place.
I'm also a great possibility of learning as a language, as the language, mathematics and games where people can try the things to try to try the things quickly, and see the results of immediately.
Now I'm --
This is a Fibonaction that I do with a program of equation.
Here we have a game of words that is in the Scarabeous Boggle.
Firstly, in all the turns out a letter in all Siftable, Pratically, in all the turns to every turn in every Siftable, and while you can get words out of the words of a ditionary.
And then after about 30 seconds remissing, and you have a new set and new chance and new possibility to try to try to try to try to be able to try to try to be able to try to get a new chance and new possibility of the rest set of the remissing set and new possibility of the sit and new possibility of the sit and new possibility set of the site charge and
Thank you.
Here's the children came to the Media Lab, I did it in the Media Lab, and I gave a video.
They are please.
And one of the interesting things about this kind of application is that you don't have to give people many instructions.
You just said, "Look, "Liks, and they will spreadly what to do.
That's what people are trying to do it.
This is our most of the most jump, there in the right.
It actually wanted to be a large impigs.
They just were just bad for him.
Now, this is a kind of an interactive carton is a interactive carton.
We wanted to build a tool for the English Lui is Felix.
It can inserve new characters in the scene, to be slieving their associats.
It can inserve new characters in the scene, to be slieving their associats.
And it's doing it out of the sun.
Video: The sole is sun.
David Merrill: Now he brought a treat in the scene.
Video: The treat the arancient.
Bel work!
So school ses and put the neighbors can interact the characters --
Video: Bau!
-- as inventing your story.
Video: Ciao!
DM: It's a final story with open-open-in-shot story.
DM: It's a final story with open-open-in-shot story.
Video: Vole,
DM: The last example I showed you is a tool, I realized to be a tool, to execk and exeguy and exective music.
it's a tool, realized to the recently, to exect and exequally to execk music.
Siftable here is the basis of the basis and batteria.
Each one of these has four different variations, and you can choose what use.
You can get these sound sound these sounds in a sequence of the coming sequence or please;
And modificate it just making a "sound to touch a "sequence."
These are actually that you can control in the live, as the movie.
And you attack a particular and then including the skin the sky.
And then there are the general effects as time and volume, which is apply to the sequence.
Let's look like works.
Video: DM: We're going to start a base in two Sift," "sequencadi," we system, we system, the system, we add it in a series, we add other basis.
Now I put a basis.
Video: DM: Oh, I add the percent ussion.
Video: DM: And I'm going to put the bacteria, so I can control the effect of live.
Video: DM: I know how to fast the whole sequence is going to link on the other.
Video: DM: And I'm going to add the movie to the based to give more expression.
Video: DM: I can recombine the sequence of the volo."
So I didn't have to planning it before, but I can try and make it more sending it to make longer a little more corty.
And now, finally, I can get the whole sequence in the left sequence including the Siftable to the Siftable "volume."
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is build new interfaces and more more and more more more and more more and more more and more more and more more and cord.
And today, I had time to show you one of the results of this percording to some possibility that we try to get out of the lab.
The concept I want to transmmeters is that is coming this new generation of objects to interact with digital media with digital media in our world that we want.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the now to talk to all of you.
I'm a writing writing in the writing.
Scare about books is my professional is that of course of course of course of course.
It's also the love and the fascination of my life.
And I didn't expect that can change it.
But I said that, something particular is happened in my life and in my careera, who let me recently that he took me to realibrate the entire reported with this work.
The particular thing is I recently written this book, this biography called Mangia, Prula, Ama." And I was a very good sensition for some reason for a few reason that I became a great sensational.
And the result is that everywhere from now, people are hunger to me as if I was convicted to me.
For -- convict: convict!
They are all worried and said, "You don't have to be able to wouldn't you fear more to do it?
You don't have to be able to continue to write all life without any more power to create a book that can be able to create a book that can be able to somebody who can you have somebody who can you can care anybody?"
that can be able to somebody eleven?"
It's a very insure that you know.
But it could go worse on the worst of 20 years ago, when I started to say that I started to say to people -- I was a adolescent -- I wanted to be a writic.
I meet it against the same reaction of the country.
And people said, "I don't want to have a time I can't have successful to have success?
Don't you fear that the upon refit out of the killers killed you know?
You don't have to do this mester for all life without any of life without any of the swimming on a cumulation of the heart of the clear skets with the mests of lock and care clumps of flight?
So you know, you know.
The short answer -- the short answer to all of these questions is, "Sy."
I fear of all those things.
I always had a pain.
And I also have a lot of other things that people might not have to meeting.
As the algae and other things --
But as I think about it is what I thought I was thinking and ask about the last few of course.
Is it it do?
It's logic, who anybody to expect to be expected by a work that you feel out of a job that was born to do.
But what is so particular in the imprese creative to make us realize about the mind of the minal health in a way that other carrier doesn't do?
As my father, for example, he was a engineer and I don't rememistry in his 40 years of the activity where he was asked if he was asked to be engineer if he was going to be engineer if he was going to be engineer to be engineer capit?
She never was -- that block of the engineer John, how do you w?
It didn't work, you know?
Enestly, the engineers don't have certainly in the secouple of course in the secool reputation of being alcolized to be alcolized in depressure.
We have enough of the writers -- not only about the writers but creative writers but creative reputation of all generes, we have this reputation of being huge instable.
And it's not going to look at the tristakes of the magnific deaths of magnific minds that only in the 2th century, they did, they often yputting them up.
And the ones that are not suicidata seems to be really disagreed by their women.
Norman Mailer, before I did, in the last interview said, "Ogny my book has killed me a little bit of a little bit of a little more extraordinary remarkable to work of the work.
But we don't have the other when we heard this because we heard these things very long as we can completely interior somehow we completely interior and accepted the notion and the ness and the ness and the suffering that art and the art will always be in a woodse.
And the question I want to ask all the today is what is is, you agree with this ideas?
It goes to be this -- because it also looks at a centimeter of the distance of myself well as well as this suppose.
I think it's odiod.
And I think it's also dangerous and I don't want to see it in the next secolog.
I think it's better encourage our great minds creative minds creative minds in lives.
And I know that in my case -- in my case, in my case, it would be very dangerous, I would have a lot of supposed to that I was in my careers.
Of course, I mean look at that, I'm pretty young, I have about 40 years.
I still have about four decades in me.
And it's very likely to be likely to be going to write from the world as the work that I used to be right from the world as the work that I was going to be successful in my last book.
I'll be slaved to skky, because we're all more or less friends here -- it's likely to my greatest success is to my shoulder my shouldn't be in the shoulder my shouldn't be a skick in my shouldn't be a skke.
Oh, Gesus, that I think.
You know this is the kind of thinking about the person to start to start to start to start to start to go to the nine morning.
I would continue to do this work that we do.
So, the question becomes do?
And so I seed it after a lot of reflections, that the way to work to continue to get a psychological cool, OK?
I have to find a distance of the security of me, I am writing in me, and my natural ang on what reaction reaction is going to get E, while I was trying to get out of the time to look through the time, trying to look through the time, trying to find other societies to look at other societies to see if I could have the best ideas and sane if I had the best ideas and sane slooks.
how to help people creative to help people are going to do the emotion.
And that searching me to the ancient Greea and Roma.
Seguitems because I gave it back to certain the back.
In the ancient Grecia and Rome -- people didn't look like creativity -- people didn't look at the creativity came from humans, OK?
And it was thought that creativity was this spirit is about the wine and sevener to men from a few surgery and unknown as wind and souldn't be awful and unknown and unknown as wind and unknown out.
They were called the "demoney, the people are looking at the people of the creativity "demoni."
Socrates, wonderful of course, he believed to have a demon the long-away wisdom of long.
The Romans were the same idea, but they called the kind of spirit without a genius.
The big is because Romans didn't think that a genius.
They believed that a genius, a kind of divine that he was going to live in the walls of the study of an artist, a little bit like the elf, Dobby, and that was selling nassister of the work.
Exional thing -- that's the distance of the park -- that the psychological struction that psychological struction that you protect you from your work.
And everybody knew that was so that it working, right?
So the antiancient artists were protected by certain things, like the too narcism, right?
If your work was exceptional powerful you could not take all the market, everybody knew that I was helped by this genius.
If your work works, it wasn't all of your job, right?
They all knew that was your genius.
And so people do concept the creativity in Occident for a long time.
And then the Rinascient Rinascient and all the change, and we actually put this big idea; we put the human beings and no longer and no longer and no longer and no longer and no longer several to the divinity.
This was the principle of human eximution and people start thinking that creativity came to think that creativity came completely from isharing from ishing.
And for the first time in history, you start to refer this or that artist as a rather than a geniusing genius.
And I have to tell you, I think was a big error source.
I think that allow somebody to believe somebody who believing to believe as a recipient as the founds, the essence and the surprising all of the mysteries and ethern is a film or a film or too big drop to the fragile fragile to the fragile fract of human beings.
It's like to ask somebody who can engine.
Feform and creates completely the ego and creates all these extremely expectancy on the performance.
And I think it's been this pressure to have the artists in the past.
And if this is true, and I think that is the question, the question, and now?
We can do it different?
Maybe I was going to go back to a more ancient understanding of human relationship.
Or maybe no.
Maybe we can't cancelling 500 years of rational thinking in a 18 minutes.
And it's probably people in the audience that would be suspended on the notion of scientific susped scientific notions that following the people who following their projects.
I will probably not convinced you all about this thing.
But the question I would like to ask is -- why do you know?
Why do you don't think it in this way?
Because it has more sense of every other thing that I ever heard to explain the exxiety exxiety of creative process of creative process of the creative process of creative process.
A process that as anyone that I ever tented to do something -- so much of this -- yet, you don't get behavior not behavior not behavior behavior not behavior.
And in fact, it can seems completely paranormal seems completely paranorm.
I did this meeting with the extraordinary poeter Ruth Stone who now now 90 years, but it was a poetered for all of life and said that during his influence in the wall, and I was working out in the field, and I felt it was working out out in the field, and I was going to be in the walking.
He said that it was like a tremendous tren.
And that was going to get rotating towards back from the landscape.
He heard it goes to get the earth of the earth under the earth under his feet.
Sapeful to have a one thing to do to that point and it was says, "Grland and he said, "corrup."
And so it goes to the home and he was followed by this poem from this poem to take a piece of card and a nice math, and a faster in the past, while the past, and it will be the page.
Sometimes couldn't be quickly, so he was going to get up and correct and the recorded and the recorded and the poetry the roten round and she would have the roten and she would continue to roll through the landscape, and he would go through the landscape, "another poeta."
And then there were those times -- this piece doesn't forget it -- there was no minded time that was the moments that was almost allowing up, OK?
So, he was doing it in the home and was trying to charter and the poem was going through the walked through the right and he was going to be a mathemburning in the other hand then he was a walked with the other hand and the off.
And he was a poem from the cod-and the reputting the codle and the pink was the page.
And in these cases, the poem would be presented on the perfect and intact meeting -- from the last word to the first one word to the first before.
So when I felt the thought, it's exactly equal to my creative process to my creative process to my creative process.
I don't all my creative process -- I'm not a convict!
I'm a mule, and my way to work is to be sleeping it to the same orary every day and work and work and work and work and work on and work on the goes and go up and go up and go up and go up and go up and go up and go up and go up and go up and go up and work on and work on the right now.
But even in my head, I was in my head, I was done against that thing,
And I imagine that also many of you have the han fact.
You know, if the work and ideas and ideas and ideas I would have come from a certain foundly source.
And what is this thing?
And how can we do relate to the head of the head, but it doesn't have to lose your head, you know, it makes us sanies?
For as I rethink the best example of the contemporary I have the musician Tom Waits, which I interview in a day.
We were talking about this, and you know, Tom, Tom, for the magmagazinefed in the arter of the artist of the artist of the emporary around, to seek, dominate these species of impulses to creative these species of impulses.
But then he was driving -- and a day he was driving on the under cartoons Angeles, he changed all for him.
He was going to be quickly and all of a track tracking, which is a little fragment, which is the inspiration, elusive and extremely and the want, you know, it's wonderful, and the desig, you know, it's wonderful, but not how to take there.
It has no cards, it doesn't have a mathematic, it doesn't have a registrator.
So it begin to feel this kind of old old old old old that I said, "I'm going to lose you, and I will remarring out of this song is allowed by this song is going to be seed by this song of the song of this song of the song of the type to loy this kind of old old the type of the old guys.
I'm not enough I can't do it -- I can't do it."
And instead of going to stop in the panic stop.
And I'll go to the whole process and he did something completely new process and he did something completely new one.
And he looked at the sky and said, "Scusa, not see that I'm driving I driven do?"
"To you seems to be a song hor?
If you really want to exister, you know, it was going to get care when I can take care care about you.
One guys, you go to the other other today.
You go to disturbing Leonard Cohen."
And his process working changed after this.
Not work, the work was still as you know.
But the process, and the fish ane that was released when the genius, the genius, the genius, the geniusing thing else and libered it was going to come back from where I came out of the coming where I was coming out that he had to be a whole thing and he was going to be a whole thing and he came back and back back and begin and back back back and behind and the wind and the genius.
but it's a little bit of a conversation that workers in a conversation between Tom and this strange and external thing that he was not Tom.
So as I felt as a little bit of a little bit the way I was working and already saved my and saved to a time.
This idea, he saved me when I was writing "Mangia, Prula, Ama," and I fall of those class in the disperation in the disperation where we all have when we all work on something and we could start thinking that it will be a disaster, that that that that the worst will be the worst written written written written written to be the worst written in the clevered that I was written in the deal with with something that
Not just good worst the worst book.
And I started thinking about designing this project.
But then I remember Tom who talked about air and trilled.
So I went to my face in the handscape and I would say my bements to a angle of the room.
And I said to other, "Yes, I entertained what is is, I mean, we know that if this book doesn't be brilliant not going to be brilliant not going to be brilliant not going to be brilliant not going to be brilliant.
Because as I see I am going to put all that I haven't more about that.
So if you want to be better and do you have to show you you and do your party.
Okay. But if you don't do do it not quite a couple of everything.
I'm going to writing the same because I will write the same because my work.
And I would like to favor that I today today, I today today, I got to do my parthe." Because the end is that, so that it is that, OK, it is in the North people were dancing in the dances and the sacred and musicic, and musicic, and the sacred and sacker and the sack-hourselves.
And they were always magnific because the ballers were professionists and they were fantastic.
But every tankly, something happened, and one of these artists was actually transendently.
And I know what I know about what I know about it, because I know that you know, a certain point, a performance that is a lost of it.
It was as if you stop the time -- and the baller walker through a kind of last, and he was not doing anything from the solith, as the 1,000 night before, but everything you had a lot of the solid --
And suddenly not appears as a human human being.
But you access to the behind and under the didness of divinity.
And when this happen, the people were knew what was, the people know what was, they were called her named him her name.
They had the hands and started to cant, "Ah, Allah, Dod God."
This is God, you know.
And I was in historical note -- when the Moror's Spack the Spack Spack -- and the pronounce, and the pronounced sections from "Allah, Allah, Allah, Ah." "Oole, you can still feel in the corride or in the float.
In Spana, when a artist has done something impossible and magic -- "Ah, oh, magnific -- -- -- -- I mean, you know, a little bit of a deal -- a deal -- a deal of God.
And it's great.
But, the problem comes the day down, the baller's baller's seeing and discovers that are the 11-a-aunder the morning, and I sware doing.
It's just a death, with the glands to the kney, and maybe it never will be more to asclean to that alteet.
And maybe no one will be the name of God still as well, what you have to do with the rest of his life?
It's difficult to be very difficult.
This is one of the most dolors to do in a creative life.
But maybe it doesn't have to be so angood, so much as well, as you can't believe it doesn't believe, which expects of your being come from you from you have been coming from you have.
But I just stay that is just that they come from a inimaginable, the squisite squisite part of your life that you have to go to somebody else when you fine.
And you know, if we think about this whole whole change.
And so I started thinking about it, and it's sure as I thought about the different months during the workers that I'm going to public book that I'm going to prest, the dangerous, and exisside of my great degree success.
And what I have to continue when I feel electric I feel electric I wouldn't be paying.
Don't be aragain your work.
It doesn't be a presenting for your parts, whatever you can be there.
If your work is ball, ball.
If you wind, you know, as a clear to let me decide to leave some kind of wonderful time through your sforms, then for a moment through your shapes, then "Ole!"
Something is to do you dance.
And "Ole!" to yourself the same.
I think I think I think I think I have to teach it.
"Ole!" to you, only had to be a human mind and heads and heads to be able to representing you to continue to continue to continue to continue to continue to continuously.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
As you know about some of these projects on the human genome genome genome of what can meaning and discovered new set of genes.
Now we're starting a new fashion a new biology and now we started to degitalize biology and now now now from that code that we are entering in a new fashion, designing and synthetic.
We always seeing to take big questions.
"What is life, you know, it's a lot of biology biology became to figure out the levels.
We tried different approach, reduced it to the minimum minimum in the terms.
We're digitalizing from nearm.
When we sequenced the genome was going to go from the analogical world of biology in the digital world of the digital world.
Now we ask us -- we can regenerate the life, or create new life from this digital universe we git?
This is the map of a little organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, which is the little bit of the genome of the genome of those who can authorful genome in the lab in the lab of the map of the genome that can authorews in the lab of the genome of the genitalium, which is the kind of the genome of the gen
And we tried to reduce the genome to create a little bit more smaller than that.
We're able to eliminate a hundred genes of the 500 that are here.
But when we look at his map map of metabolic map of the myself to the now.
I think this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes we can elimine, one at the time, it's very imlikely to be able that this can bring it to a live.
So we decided that the only way to progression to progression to progreger this cromosome, so that we could modified components to the components to some of these founding.
And so we started the wind of the "Possetish we can synthetice?"
It can be the chemistry of producing these big molecules that we never got to create before?
And in fact, we can make a crumother?
A cruming is just a piece of chemistry material.
The speed with which we are able to digitalize the life is growing up to exponential exponential exponential exponential is growing up to exponential exponential is going to be able to exponential exponential to exponential life is growing up to exponential exponential exponential to
Our capacity of writing the genetic code of genetic code of rather slowly, but it's better than that.
And our most recents results the door is a exponential curve.
We started more than 15 years ago.
The process has required a lot of past games, starting with a biothic reviewed before I started the first experiments.
But we found that DNA is very difficult to be very difficult.
There are thousands of thousands of cars of machines in the world segments of DNA longer than 30 to 50 lectures and it's a process is a degenerative process is a degreater process is a long degree process is a long dead.
So we had to develop a new metom to assembling these framments and recort the herrors.
And this was our first tentative, in the digital information of the genome of Phi X 174.
It's a little virus that killed food.
We designed the fragments, effect the correction of the herrors and kept a molecular molecules about 5,000 letters.
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemistry and we put it in the bacteria have started to read this code and then we started to read this genetic code of virtual particles the virtual particles virtual particles the virtual particles in virtual particles in the bacterial particles and it inherent.
The viral particles are then you relet from cells, they're back back and have been back back and have the destroyed Earcoly.
I talked about recently with the oil industry was sadings that they trially understanding this model.
They have more than you.
We believe that this is a situation where the software can actually build his hundred system in a biological system in a biological system that is a biological system that is a system that is a system to be build his hardware in a biological system that software can actually build the same hardware in a bi
But we wanted to do things more in greater things in great.
We wanted to build the whole cruming of the bacteria.
I'm more than 580 miles les are codes of genetic code.
So we thought about built it in the cassetets of viruses, so that we could change the cassets to understand what the component is components of a living cell.
The design is crucial information is crucial information in a computer, these must be very accurated.
When we seeing this genome for the first time in 1995 accuratem was a standard for every 10 mibe.
We found out of this original squence, 30 error sequence. If we had ever been able to do it work.
One of the process is to designer segments that are going to be obvious to all other segments of 50 lectures of the other segments of the tiny works.
We do it elements here are until elements here.
You probably have to read that we read the phylight --
Think about this thing: we have a genetic code genetic code genetic code and T.
Three of those lects codified about 20 friend's minoacidis -- and there's a specific order to each other.
So we can use the genetic code for words, fraise --
What we did in the beginning was autiful to the beginning was augment.
Some were delauses from the fact that it wasn't going to be a poeke.
We designed these segments for just to unique them with a huge with my half with a hummous.
There are immes that repaid them and put them and put them together.
And we started to assembling the particular segments from five to seven miles les a seven milectly segments to get 72 miles to their letter to get 72 miles to get 72 miles to 72 miles to get 72 miles a letter to seven my letter to seven my letter to segments in a mile lk.
And every step we produced these segments in abundance so that we can sequence, so that we're trying to create a excediment in a minute.
We're trying to cars to self-to-process.
So, this seems the tableon a basis of basis of basket.
When we get to these very longments, more than 100 miles -- more than 100 miles are going to be directly in E.
You get to the limited tools of molecular biology.
So we have seen other mechanisms.
We knew about another mechanism called recombination called recombination of omologists to repaid the DNA to repaid the DNA degrees of the seat.
Here's an example.
This organism, called Deinococcus radioduring three million radiodness three million rad rad rad of radiation.
You can see in the requader as his cromosome.
In 12 -- 24 hours is reassembled exactly as it was before.
They are thousands of thousands of organisms that are able to do it.
These organisms can be completely seeing completely
They can live below the sea ske.
I'm absolutely sure life existed in space, and you get to find new environments of water.
As the NASA showed that this aven.
This is a picture of the molecules that we built using these process, just using the process, just using the design appropriate segments from inserious segments of segments of the molecule.
The livivisit them to assemble self.
This image was not taken with a electronic microscopic microscopy rule.
It's a molecular molecules that we can see it with a microscopic microscopic molecule.
These are pictures that covered a period of about six seconds.
This is the audience, we did a little time ago.
I'm more than 580,000 letting code code code.
It's the most largest molecules ever created by the man.
It has a fish molecular weight in 300 million hons.
If we spent it with a 10 careages, there would be 142 pages, would like to get this genetic.
Now, how do we work? How can we activate it?
Of course, we track is a game.
It's a little bit more complicated when they use bacteria.
It's just as much as much as it is a cell as our eucariot as our eucariot as our nucleum and enserve a other, which is practically the process of clonation.
In the bacteria archaea is instead is instead of the cell phone is integrated in the cell phone that we are able to do a complex trapier trapiece of a cromosome.
We can have a cromosome, in a kind of a microbial species
The two are different as men as men as men as men as a men are different than men of topis.
We have added some gene gene in a way that I could decide what choot to chromother.
And it turns out to kill all the proteins.
And when we put it in the cells was stuff -- and you open our softwo, the new softwo-softw-cromosome, the new cell is gone in the cell.
And we started thinking that we couldn't go to the point -- but we tried it all over there.
This is one of the most exectural mechanisms.
We found that many species have added a second or a third or a third cromosomes from a few thousands of new tracks in a second thousands of new tracks in that species.
So who thinks about evolution as a gene time you modific is not understood that most biology.
There is a restrial called "inemployment is that degerish digerish DNA.
The cromosome, that was in the cell doesn't have a little bit of it.
The cell phone -- the cromosometimes that we insert ha.
And you know, it has recognized the other crum, as a extrank mmyself as a extrankly, and we found out with only the crumodel.
it became blue because of the genes that we insert.
And in a short of time, all the cartotoons of a kind of games are gone in a new species, and it turned out of the new species, which we put in the new software in the cell.
All the protein are changed, membranes are changed, and when we read the genetic code genetic code genetic code of what we have transfer to what we have transfer with it.
Now, this could seem the genetic, but altering the software DNA we can change the things in a good enough sustain.
Now, I explained that this is not about genesis -- but I was going to go from three million years from three million years olds, and I said that maybe we're going to create a new version of the explosion of Cambrian explosion of this digital process of degree in degree process of degital process of degital.
Why do that?
I think it's enough when we think about our needs we think about our needs.
We're going to go from six billion people in the next 40 billion people in the next 40 years.
I was born to give an example: I was born in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for each one of the planet for this was 40 years, there will be four years, there will be four years.
We're going to find a lot of things now to find food, water and clean and clean inner and banth, and banks for six billion people.
It will be more hard-hard for nine billion.
We are more than five billion carbon of olide -- more than 30 billion bars.
That means a million books.
When we try to find biological processes or any kind of processes to repirate them, it will be a huge challenge to be a huge challenge to be a challenge.
In the most of the CO2 emission of the CO2 emission of these materials that finishes in the atmosphere.
At today, thanks today, thanks to the scientific discovered with about 20 million genes, and I like to think that are the designed components to be the designed components for the future.
The electronics only a dozen dozen of components, and think about how many different things are coming out.
Our limited here are main reality and our imagination.
Now we have a techniques, thanks to these synthetic methesization, to create what we call genomics synthetic.
We're able to build a big robots that can produce a million chromosomes in a million cromosomes.
Think of processing these 20 million genes or tries or trying to get the processes to produce the processes to produce or drugs, we can change it, we can change it, thank you very much, and create more biology, and create more biology, and create more biology.
And it's just a standard section of standard.
We can chemistry for possibilities of survive or carbon or carbon or carbon or carbon getc.
This is a few software some software programmed to be able to be able to seeing species to seeing species to set up the computer.
Well, we don't know necessarily as it will be not.
We know exactly what the genetic code.
Now we're concentrying on the rest of the generation.
You also saw you can see the ethanol from grand was a was a mal.
We have a second degrees and third generation that will be enough pretty much more pretty soon as the waller as the either types of butanol.
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without a big impact without a lot of the food and limited the disease. And the conversation is to transform the CO2 in primal materials that we are working for cells that can reach this discovering that they can get the discovered that we could get the first carburant to 18 month.
The sunlight with CO2 is a methodom -- but in our discovered in our discovered all the world, we found different metodis.
This is a organism we described in 1996.
She lives in the ocean deep in the ocean for the temperature of the water perature of the water.
It is put out of the CO2 using hydrogen molecular energy.
We're trying to figure if we can instead of CO2, which can be transported tramite tramite tubs, to convertising that CO2 in carbon this process.
So short we think we could be able to increase what the question of the question, "What is the asking, "What is the Not -- we have the extremely goal to repirate the whole industry.
Exactly. If you can't do it from TED, where you can't do it anyway?
It would become a main of energy.
Inoltor we're working for the same methods to create vaccininistant vaccines.
You saw this year with the influence, we're always background a year and with a dollar and a dollar, when it's about found the right --
I think that this is a whole vaccinable to change combinable in anticipath in a huge vaccinable.
That's how the future would start seem to change it, it looks changing, now, the tree of evolution with synthetics, and ended the evolution with synthetics, and infinally cells and infinally cellum and indeed,
We're so much as much as better to be able to be able to be able to be able to be so better than people.
Our purpose is to make a long enough to try to do it very much for it. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
First of all I will see the most quickly possible, some work work that we took the new technology that we took Microsoft in the Microsoft in a nearly year ago.
It's a environment, you can interact is to the local level that remote with a huge amount of visual data --
So we're seeing a lot of gabyte photographs with a kind of digital zoom and continue for a quick of gaby's digital fast.
And it doesn't matters as much as a lot of information that we see, as big as we see as big these data or the data or images.
Most is a digital pictures -- but this for example is a scansion of the Bilibrary of the Congress and reenter in the gamma of 300 megam.
It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that the praying the number of system as this is the number of place in your screen in any time.
This is a book inter, example of data doesn't images.
This is the Casa desolated Dickens. Every cool represents a capitly.
To show you that it's just about text and not images, we can do a thing about general representation of the representation of a representation of the textremely representation of the textremely in a picture.
It could be a little artificial way.
It doesn't be considering.
This is a more realistic example of the Guardian.
Each image is the beginning of a section.
And it gives you really the pleasure and beautiful experience of a version of a view or a net of a newspaper of a quotid-like a lot of meet.
We also did something with the angle of this number of this number of Guardian.
We created a high advertising out of the other, much more than that you used in a normal audience.
If you want to see the characteristics of this authomobile, you can see here.
Or other models, or even the specific specific specific things.
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space.
We hope that this means to put pop on and other hundred of other porks, not to be necessarily as you have to be necessarily as you can have to be necessarily as well.
Of course, map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology.
And I don't want to lose the time, if not to say that we don't say that we have contributes in this field.
These are all the way in the U.S. sovered image in the NASA.
So now we go to something else.
This is actually actually in the webs; you can go to the Web; you can go to see.
It's a project called Photosynth, which is a combine two different technology.
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual research of Noah Snavely, a student of the University of Washington with the See Sevidence See See Seviski Rick Sebooki Rick Sebooki Ricrosoft Research.
And it's from the web, I gestring from Seadragon.
You can see that when we do this kind of screen -- we can go from a picture of the other and have this kind of experience to the other multiple solution to multiple solution of the multiple resolution.
But the collocaon the images here has actually a meaning.
The gorithms of visualization of the computer have regists together, so that they correspond to the realize that imagined -- all the neighborhood in the Grashi Grashi Grashi -- were all the cleaning dogs. Some of the element.
I don't know if I have time to show you some other environment.
There are a lot more space.
I want to go directly to one of the original data set of Noahang -- and this is from a precedent protype of Photosynthesiron. And I want to show you what I think is really the clear technology, Photosynth. And it's not necessarily to this technology, technology, Photosynth. And it's not necessarily to set in the web.
We had to worry about legal waste and say.
This is a rebuilding in Notare the Notare Dame images -- he took from Flickr. Basta digitary to the Notre and you get images of the types of the field of the field of these fields in the field of these constants and he saw a picture that is to display this model.
So I'm all images that Flickr and I was all college in this way.
And it's possible to navigate in this simple.
You know, I would never have thought of finished to work for Microsoft.
It's very gratification to get this kind of accool.
I think you can see that it's a lot of different types of different kinds of focuses of the cell phone of the cell phone significant, a number significant, must have significant, must have a significant number of this environment.
And if I think about the most strange to try to look at the strange.
Many are tough to block, etc.
Something is a series of photographs -- here is a series of photographs --
This is a Notare Notare Damamam's poster registrated.
We can go from the places to the physical view.
The essential point is that we can do things with the social environment. This is now taking from all the way -- from the entire memory of view -- and the visive view -- and college all those data together.
All of those pictures become together, most of the slights.
You have a model of the land that emerge.
Think about this as a long long as the Stephen Lawler on Earth virtual Earth
It's something that is grows in complexity as people use, and the people who use, and the vantages for those who uses use.
Their photographs are marcare meted with other people.
If somebody is the idea of consciousness is all these sexiety saying, my picture of Notare of Notre Dame suddenly Dame suddenly recognize all the data, and I can use the point of all those dates, in the metail, in that universe, in that universe, using the photographs of the kind of a little social experience of a little social experience of a little bit of a little social experience of a kind of a kind of a little bit of a little social experience of the kind of skingertial experience of a social experience of a little bit of the social experience of a little bit of the cross
Of course, a consequence of all the way of the virtual virtual virtual virtual of the Earth, not only only by view and sex-airplane and sex-similar and similar memorie.
Thank you very much.
CA: I understood that is that what your software to be going to be taking to do is that in the next few years to do is that in the next few years ago all the photographs that are going to be ready to be ready connected?
BA: Yeah. That's what is doing in practice.
It's creating hyperlin, if you want to be in images.
And it's doing it in the bottom of the images.
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the information of the seeds that many of these images that many of these images can be a lot of these images that many of these images that many of these images that many of these images that many of these images that many of these images that many of these images images that many of these images that many of these images images that are the seeds of these images.
As when you do a search of images on the web -- you digites a fracing and the page, has many information about the images of the photos.
Now, what happens if that picture is a picture of all your photos down?
So the amount of interconnection and the amount of seeds and the amount of reckness that is really huge effect of the net.
CA: Blaise, it's really incredible.
BA: You say you very much.
One of the main principal when you travels you travels of the ethnographics is the power in who has no anti-mind-to-mind-led delivered the past, you touch it in the wind of the ploddge, it is in the short of the plants.
Basti thinking that sciams Jaguar Jaguar is still the Lattea -- the My Mithans are still cools of significant in Himalaya, the buddms are still the breath, to remember, to remember, to remember, to remember the importance of the anthropologia, and that idea that we live not existed in a sense of reality, but it's just a model of reality, but it's just a model of the model of reality, but it's just a model of model of the idea of the idea of a model,
the consequence of a particular choices of adaptative choices that our stirst, many generations ago.
And of course, all of the essential tratels.
We all come in. We all procreive.
We are subjects in the initiation.
We have to deal the inexorse of death, so it doesn't surprising us and ballos --
all of us to art.
What the range is the particular song, the range, the rhythming of every culture.
It doesn't matters that are the Eartype of the Borneo, or the Haiti, or the Haiti, or the Haiti, or the Saharan Sepenter's Candsetters, Curglevel, or a cameleras the Sahara.
He was my company of my journey in the desert of the month in the desert in the walls of the Qomolangma, the Everest, the demother of the world.
All these populations teachers are other ways of thinking, other ways of thinking, other ways of thinking, other ways of thinking, other ways of move in the world.
And if you reflect a moment, it's a concept that can give you hope.
And so the myridging of cultures of life is a rather and cultural life and cultural beats that you wanted the planet and it's important for the planet and it's important for the planet as the ragnatebiological raise.
And you can think about this very cultural raising cultural ethnos: you can call the ethnos: the ethnos: the total ethoal ethnics, myth, inspirations, inspirations, inspirations, inspirations, inspiration, intuitions from the consciouse.
The eetns: the fantastic remoney.
It's the symbol of what we can be in how inquist species --
And as the biosphere was free that was gravely consumed as the ethnoise.
No biology, for example, it would say 50-percent of all the species was or the extinction of the extinction of the extinction -- in the most apopocket, in the most addition -- and not near the biological diversity -- and not near a little bit of the cultural diversity.
The indict of all of this is course, the language.
When you were born there were 6,000 languages on this planet.
One language is not just by a vocabolary or from a glack or from a series of rules of the gramics.
One language is the short of human spirit spirit.
It's the meeting with the animation of every culture is going to be in the world
English is a forest of mind, a wind, a thinking, a system of spiritual system of spiritual system of spiritual system of spiritual.
And of those 6,000 language, as we sat Monterey, at least half the half is not sussurrounded in the ears of children.
They are not more teacher to the children, which means not walking to be walready walready knowledge -- that are already dead.
What is more tristers than being fly in the silence, to be the last to talk about a language of a language to be the wisdom of the wisdom of the children?
This is a hot of somebody in some part of the world every two weeks every two weeks of a few weeks a well-waver and with sesillabe lingua.
And I know somebody will say "I’m not be better like?
The world would not be a better place, if we talk about the same language?" Benism?" Benism, then we talk all yoruba. We talk all all around the same sides.
We talk about kogis.
Scover a track thing wants to say not to talk about your language language.
And I would like to do a journey through the ethnoise.
a little journey in the ethnose.
Most of us forget that when I say "different different ways of existers" inting really different ways of exist.
We take for example this bimbo Barasana, in Amazonia in the Sepenteronial well-provided the middle of the basis of the best sacrivers of the sacright.
It's a popull that is not able to distinguisn't in the blue color, because the celests is identify in the forest, from the wind of the popular forest, which is done in the popular forest,
They have a different strange and a mathemthematrimonial regle ruly, "English loglinguistica," you can get a person, which is a different language.
All it has been in the past mythological putcholarity is that in these family extensive six or seven language in the seven language of mathematics no one language.
They listen to listen and then start talking about.
We take one of the most interesting tribes that I lived with the Waorans of Ecuador Ecuador in 1958.
In 1957 mission missionary mission of a coming hourselves a fact that
They made it from the high photographs that they returned them in a few people who returned them in a few hundred forest, that this population wouldn't seen anything that was never seen anything in the size.
They have a little bit of the photographs of a form or a form or a shape or a burn or a five form or a five missionate that he was divole, they killed five missionaries with the lance.
But Waorans don't just killed the strangers.
They knew in the hor.
Five percent of the death was caused by their stying.
We are risalitites to eight generations and we found two households, and when we insisted that one of them was a mind of them was a mind that he died that it was dead, and then they killed it was killed hurt.
The cactors were able to recognize the animal from 40 and recognize the animal species.
In the first years early '80s, I was assigned a very interesting when my professor Harvard to ask me if I wanted to go to Harvard to Harvard the power of Duvalier societies and Tonton Macoutes, and Tonton Macoutes, and Tonton Macoutes, and impossessed to do the else of the power and I was used for the gund-usual g.
For a sense of my miracle -- I should have the Vodouble culture Voodow and that Voodoo is nergly.
It's a very rather than a complex vision of the world.
Most interesting.
If you ask you to tell the big religion the world, what I saw me say?
Cristianesim: Islam, Budddhism, Ebraism, excetc.
A continent is always let me out of the sub-Saharan Africa-Saharan Africa, and he didn't have folks and Voodoo is not the other one that the distilled of these concepts very deep concepts in the trageasing the trageasing of the slavery.
What makes you interesting the voodoo is the intense of life and death.
So you have to do the spirits.
The spirits can be invocated by the Grand Acca, they answer the dance of dance and sustaining temporary the animation of the dance of view in a very short that a short that a short the dio.
For this voodoodooists love to ask "You go to talk about God.
We damage in the temple.
And from the moment you are going to be doing the beginning that you drive, how can you do you driver you?
So you know, you have these incredible events of these incredible events of trance events that touch iny infuocated in the middle of the power of the power of the power of the mind when it was catalyzed in a state of exciting extremely extremrement eventually in a state state of the mind.
And all the people who lived on the most extraordinary of the most extraordinary Kogi Sierra Nevada Santa Mara, in the Colbia Mar, in Colbia Santa Martyset.
Sombic foot in the ancient that I lived on the planet that they lived on the array of the Colbia in the conquery, the population of the conquering on the massive classic plan.
In a continent of blood sece, this popular popular continent has never been conquered by the spagnos.
At all the today is governed by a classroom, but their formation is a very extraordinary --
The young people are taken from the family to three or years and they live in a world world secregated in a world of good and they live in a world of glaciers in the icro-year-old glaciers for 18 years.
Two nine years ago of nine years to produce the nine months to reproduce the nine months that they spent in the user of the Grande Mad.
For all the time, they are acculated to the values of their societies, values that their predict and only their prejack and their pregain the cosmic balance, to say the equilibrium.
At the terms of this incredible started, they are suddenly carried out and for the first time in life in the age of 18 years, they see a albath. And in that active wrong, when the sun the wrong, the sun walks out of the beautiful countrue. The pretty beautiful ling and say:
"Do you say how I said I told you that.
It's stuff out. Oh, it's going to protect it."
They call the most brothers and say that we have these minors, are the minors, we're the pieces of the world.
This level is extremely important.
When we think about the indigene and the environment, we environment, and the old story of the nowish story of the nowish and the old historical concept in its simplicity or maybe we say these popules are closer to Earth us.
The indigenes are not none of our algic peoples are not under by our algia.
There is no space, for these things in the Abombs of the Tibet, but because it's infusing on the Tibet, but because of time and they created a mystick of the Earth is not about the concept of the Earth is not a lot of a closer under and a lot of the Earth can live because it's infusing only the human consciously below the Earth of human being.
What do you want to say that?
I mean, that a guy that a guy grows grows that the mountain is a spirit of Apu is a destine being a destore of a very different and will be a very different reportable and it will have a different respect with the mountain a lot of a bunch of Montana girl, and a girl of the Montana mm.
which is the dimore, a mineral was a mineral mineral is irrist.
What is interesting is interesting is the metaphor, which defines the report of the individual world and the natural world of natural world,
I grew up in the forests of the Columbia Britannica creating the forests of being cut to be cut up.
That has got me a different human beings from my friends who believe the Her credia Kway's dia to the Hukukuk and the well-well-wells and the wells of the paradisease, and the write of the world, the Hamatsa.
If you start consider these cultures can create different reality of different reality to start understand their discoveries of their discoveries sensation. We take this plant.
I took this picture to approach, in the norm.
Maybe some of you have heard about the ayayaxis -- the most powerful dest of the repertorious sciamanic repertor of the sciamanic repertor of the sciamanic repertor of the sciamanic repertor of the sciamanic repertor of the gamanic repertor of you have heard of the gamanic repertor of you have heard of the gamanic repertor of you have heard about the gamanic repertorial sciamanic gam.
What makes it fascinating the ayayaxis not the potential to the macological potential of sustance, but his elaboration. It's compoint of two elements.
On one side, this liana line that contion a series of betacarbon and harmine and harmor and harmly hallucinogen.
I make the only folding the sunt is a bluear that alter, and it is a little bit of consciously, but it's myself with the carbon of a great family of the coffee of the coffee Psychotic.
This plant is a deployed triptamine, very similar services -- demethoonina, methoxydimethoxydimethoxydimeet.
If you ever see the Yanomami to the nose of the sustance that they do from a different set of species, which is a different species, anched meetings of species,
To be a little bit like being sparated to the nose is a little bit like being sparated by a fuclums and late on a matter and to get a mand lactering a distory of reality; it creates the dissolution of reality.
I was often with my professor, Richard Evan Shultes, the man who has shot the psychedelic, with his discovered fungallucinogens in the '30s, in Mexico.
Second my texs can classify these triptams as wouldn't tell anybody that if you're done no one to tell anybody to be able to tell anybody to be about.
It's possible to assummers just if they assums with other sustances that money money with other chemics that money with other sustances that money with other sustances that are the MAO.
Now is the beautiful -- the beta-carbon is in this lian is inbitors of MAO, of the same kind of necessary to the trip of the source of the source of these people, as they do this popular popular popular popular popules -- like they do these people, but if you start to fight out two deads of this way?
We use the great euphemism of proof and the herror, that can be reveal to be reveal to be realize it.
But if we ask the Indians, they will tell us "The plants will tell us "The plants of us."
What do you want to say that?
This tribes, Cofan, has 17 variety of ayayax, which they distingures in the forest forest, and that the eyes would be in the same species.
If we ask the how they stabilish their tassonomy will tell us "I thought I was not knowing how to do I understand of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of them will say, "I thought I was not know?
The solution is, you take 17 variety in a nice night in a nice and each other.
With this is not going to Harvard, but it's much more interesting than count the startly.
Now, the problem is that the problem is that the problem of us that are the people who are the popular wind people are ptorness to the margins of the story of the world real-real-short world and real-to-real-to-dropping in the world of our real world is that the real world
In fact, the XX century, in 300 years, not going to be remember or the innovations or the technological innovation and innovations that we were stopped and we have been habbracing the distruction of biological diversity and we have the distructural distructural dies of biological diversity and cultural issue.
All cultures through the secolums are involved in a dance for new possibility of life.
And the problem is not technology.
The Indians are not stopped to be Sioux when they put out of the arch and freck and freck as Americans don't have been hunt of Americans have no mess.
It's not the change or technology that integrity of the ethnoise.
The fact of the domination.
And if you look at the world, you will discover these are not destink of these are not destiny cultures are destiny to disappear.
They're living and dynamics out of the inner existence forces from the inner forces that are beyond their ability to adaptable.
I think it's a lot of disbodies in the patria of the guy --
a popull of Sarawak, in Sarawak, in the so-a-asic popular population that has lived in the forest forest, and now reduced to the server and produced to the service and the river, where you can see the rivers, where you can see the river, the boundrove Borneo Mar Cinese Maracter Cinese Mar Cinese ManCinese ManCinese illuminate the Mrdions --
pronive stick of the inner stiving the outside.
Or in the case of Yanomams, are the diseases that are coming with the discovered of the or.
If we move on the Tibet, where I'm doing a lot of search where I'm doing a lot of search -- you will see the during the political domination.
As the genocide of the genocide of a popular popul, it's convicted to universal level -- but the ethnowed the car of the popular style of a popular popular environments, but addid, it does part of the developed in the environments, because it makes part of the development.
And you can't understand the suffering of Tibet until you get out of the beginning.
I got the 6,000 miles from Chinoccidental in the Western Cina in the Western Cina in Lhasa young college, but only came to Lhasa young college, but only came to Lhasa I realized the statistics that we heard about it.
6,000 world, sacred monuments in policy and care wind and care wind and cry-crows in the policy.
1.2 million people killed by the military Rivolution in the Cultural.
The father of this guy was ascriting in the Panchen Lama.
The thing that means that was killed to the Chinese invasion
Her is coming with Santity in Santity in Santity during the people in Nepal.
Her mother was imprisoned and his colpa was to be recover.
It was taken to hidden the age of two years from the age two years aascondente the gonna gonna get out of his gonna live without of him.
The sister, who did the sample, it was put in the field of reeducation.
A day he involved a calculated fascia raffuring Mao Mao or and that was the major seven years.
The Tibet of Tibet can be insurrounded it to the population of the population is from hunger to the popular --
And it all reduces up all the way up to a choice.
We want to live in the world of the monod's monod's monopen the policromatical world policromatical policy?
The big anthropologists Mead, before it was that his greatest land. It was that the most of our vision was that in our world, not only will see the whole gamma of human imagination of the human imagination of the human imagination of the human imagine, but a day, but a day, a day we will have a day.
And it's a lot of remind that our species is existed for 600,000 years.
The Rivolution in Neolitical Rivolution that has done the seeds to us the seeds of seeds to the cult of the seeds of the class of the clerarchia with the gerarchia gerarchia of specialization, and we talk about 10,000 years ago.
The modern world industrialized has 300 years.
That slide story not suggests that we have the answers to all the challenges that we have to be going to be going to be going to be going to be there.
When these myriades of cultures of the world is asked what it means to be humans, they respond with 10,000 voices different voices.
And it's in these answers that all the answer we all response to be what we are like, a consciousnes: a kind of consciousness and all the people and all the people and all the gards can be a great moments of optimism.
I took this picture on the northm of Britisland when I went to cack in the Inudd-with Inum and this man, Olaya, he told me the wonderful story of his grandfaon.
The canaden government is not always been a gentled and in the '50s, and in the '50s, we have them in the sound of the hundred them in colonies.
The grandfather of this man refused man.
The family, I was in his life, he took all the arms and all of his arms and all of his attention to his life.
You have to know that Inuit doesn't climber, they don't care the freezed the freeze.
The packs of the sline in the origin shared skin the skin the skin the skin the skin the skin the hell.
The grandfather of this man doesn't make a non-non-non-blizes or from the lizartics that suffer that suffering.
It's skin a skin the skin the skin the skin the skin and defect in your hand. When you do the focus.
It has been salived on the sharing of this coltail of caccess and when I save it a dog.
It has got a bunch and created a brief broken a bunch of the sline has created a slitta, he has impect another dog, and it's a sunger in the banks, cool in the rest in the reef.
We want to talk about caving it with nothing to nothing to nothing about the world. And then, in different ways, [Applausi] is the symbol of the resilience of the world and all the people.
In the 1999 the government canadese was in the Inuit the control of the total control of a total land's largest California and Texmed Texmythese.
It's their new patria. It's called Nunavoid Nunavut.
It's a territorium. They are all the resources.
One of a national example of how a nation-state country with his popular popular him.
And finally, I think it's pretty obvious to the people who are in these zone of us was in these remote areas, remote that doesn't be remoted.
For somebody is home.
They represented the human imagination that humans are section. And for us all these children, as the sections of our children, as the skin the geography of the hope.
Finally, we National Geographic is we convinced that political will never get to anything to nothing to nothing anything.
We believe the polemy --
[Applausive is not persuasive, but we think the stories can change the world, and maybe we are the best institution, and maybe we are the best institutions.
156 countries are transmitted our television is a television
Our reviews are lets from millions of people.
Our work is traveling in the ethnos: to be able to bring our public in places that are going to be a cluster than they saw up, hope, they hope, they hope, they hope, they hope, and we have to find the middle election in different places, and we have to find a style in the world of life, and we have to find a plug in the world in a pluralist,
where the wisdom of all the popules can contributing to our well-being a collective wisdom.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some things I wrote in this book that I hope to recall other than you know, I hope to go to the other college in the case I wrote them in the case doesn't now.
I want to start with what I call the offical."
The offical officer of thing?
The offical officer of all societies in the Western industrial societies -- "If we want to massimize the well-being of our citizens" is to male the freedoms "The way to be a freedom.
The reason for the liberty is in the fact that liberty is in the same a value, it precious, it is preciout, essential for human beings.
Another is in the fact that if we are free, each of us can act all of us to do everything that massive our benefit to us all our well.
The way to massive liberty is to male is to myself the choice.
More choice people are liberty, more are libereks, and most of the freedom, and it's their freedom, it's their freedom.
This is so deeply is so deeply in society that no one was going to put it in the two-hunger society.
And it's also deeply in our lives.
I'll show you some examples of what the progress has made possible.
This is my supermarket. It's not particularly great.
I allowed me to be a simple named on inheavy half instance.
In my surmarket are 175 conditions, without containing the 10 varieties of olivariets and the 12 acets that you can buy a number of holishing number of minutes in the care of the engineer in the circumstance of your own own degradiments.
That's the supermarket.
And then you go to the electronic stere: casses, casses, slector CD, slight? CD, radio, the surprise.
And in this single snegotial of electronic components is a big number of components.
We can make six million different different combine combination of different combinations using the components that there are in a negotid.
You have to admit that there's very much choice.
Other field -- the world of communications.
One time, when I was a child, I could get all the cell phone of the cell phone -- wish the phone that they were fornitited by mam.
She was reading the phone didn't buy it.
One consequence of that, in the other, was that the telephone doesn't rope --
These are gone there,
Now we have a variety of phone almost engineering phone of the phone -- especially between cells.
Here's the future.
My favorite is what the MP3, the MP3, cutter, and the force in the hundred of the hidden in the cranks.
If you don't have seen in the negotic negotid, you're beginning to be able to prejumping it will be going to revery.
And what happens is that people are going to happen, and it does this question. And you know what the answer is "No."
It's not possibly possibly to buy a cell that not do too many things.
So, in other aspects of life that are much more importantly, it's the same explosion of choice.
Assistance, not happening in the United States that you go from doctor and the doctor and the doctor and the doctor and the doctor of the United States you have to do.
And then you go from doctor, and the doctor, "OK, we could do A, or B" "A, we could do A, B" "A, you can do it?" "Bs have these wells and these risks.
You say, "Dotor, what I should do?"
And the doctor says, "She has these wells and these risks, and the answer and these risk."
"What do you want to do that?"
And you rebasi: "Dottor if she was me, she was going to do it?"
And the doctor: "But I am not le."
The result is called the "malato," expression that it seems to be a good thing.
But it doesn't really be a slide and responsibility to take the decisions of taking decisions somebody knows what somebody knows anything else -- and so it doesn't know anything -- and so not in the ideal conditional to take the signal to take the patient.
There is a huge marketing products of drugs -- I would say people like me and you, if you think it doesn't have any sense, it has no sense, it has no sense, it doesn't have any sense.
But if we can't buy them -- why do you public them be?
The answer is that they want to do the doctor of the recipe to change the recipe of changing the recipe.
Something that is so foundation is our identity issue is a choice, as you see in this jobs in this jobs -- we don't want to force their sex sex to the right moment is a more identity: we have to do not have a more identity:
And we can reinventing us how many times we can reinvent.
The means that every morning, you have to decide that I want to be a kind of person, you want to be like.
And I read to the family and mathematrimonished -- a common time, and spread for anywhere, was that he was that you could get the most pretty much as possible, and it was starting the most pretty possible,
The only true was choice was with choice -- not so that I don't even know what to do later.
Ogo, everything is really to play.
And I set to students at a lot of smart to be less than working about a time.
And because they're not less because they're less diligent.
But I am impensiers, I mean to ask you, I would say I wish I would this? I would this?"
"I would be a little more tardi? I thought before I do you get the children or career?"
I'm interrogative interrogative interrogative --
And they are trying to answer these questions, even if this imply doesn't completely completely the compites that are not going to get a vote to my exam.
And they have to really do it. They're important.
Now, the work: we are lucky, as Carl technology was in the technology that allows us to work every day, every day, every day, every day, every day, from every day, tranne that from Hotel Randolphe.
It was parents, there's a angline, and I'm not going to tell anybody where, where WiFi works.
I don't say that I want to use it.
What does this mean this incredible liberty liberty of choice that we have to continuously decided we have to decide anyway, if we have to work or not.
We can go to see our child play hot with the cell phone in a tasca, Blackberry in the other, and the net tebook, typically on the eye.
And even though they're all spent, every minutes that we see our child is also going to be asked to say, "I have to answer this called ""I have to answer this called ""I have to answer this called "I have to be like, "I have to be able to get the parent, all of the parents, all of the parents, and I also ask the parents, all of the parents, and so
"I have to get to him? I have to abboxed this letter?"
And even when the answer is "no," all this makes the experience of your child or a very different than what would be in other conditions.
So, from any part of any part of it, little things and large stuff, and great, objects and stily is a question of choice.
Once the world was this: Of course, there was some possibilities, but it wasn't all of choice.
The world today is like this, the world is like, "Ilemma is a positive thing -- "Is it a positive thing --
The answer is She's Sh.
The positive side of the negative we know about the negative negative negative --
All this choice is two negative effects on the people.
The first one is that parales are working on the first paralysis instead of free.
And so many options that I would chood, it becomes very difficult to do it.
I offer an example significant -- a study conduct on the plans of the volunteers.
A college of my colleagues in the Vanker company of the gants of though, with about a million clients of a million clients in 2,000 different companies.
What she found is that for every 10 times as every 10 times the solutions that are offered in the further adesion.
With 50 founds, there's 10th less than the 10th of adesions are available only 5. Why?
Because with 50 sources that choices -- it's maledetail, and the choice is to decide and choice comes out to the indemate in the inomors.
And at the questions, and the questions, questions, and of course isn't going to be coming out of it.
You know, it doesn't just mean that these workers are going to eat the gars will be able to dog, because they don't have enough money, you want to say that the decision is so ostic that decision is so ostic that is so hostic foundation of work.
Not talk, they're losing until 5'000s per year from the data of work, which would be beyond to the true them.
So the parality is a consequence of having choice.
And I think that is the world like this.
"And finally, for ethis: ketchup, sense or major major majory?"
You would have to take the right decision if it's for ethnity, right?
You don't want to choose the wrong source, and neps the wrong condition.
So this is the first effect. The second is that even if we could avoid parals, and I do a choice, we actually get out of how we would have been able to be less with less options that we were going to be less with less option.
And this for different reasons.
One of these is that with a lot of people who are going to chood, if you buy a and it's not perfect and it's not perfect to be a different choice, and that what happens would be better than it would be better than the alternative imagined us induce and the choice, and the choice, and the reduce soddd-hold, and the sodddden the decision that is the present to the decision of the present present ent --
even when it was a very good decision.
More choice is more easy to be easy to be insodddispiece that it's insodddispiece of choice.
Inol, there's what economists call the opportunity.
Dan Gilbert asked a very well stamack of the things we are going to depends on what we confrontive to what we confrontive with it.
From is, when there are many options of options, it's easy to representing the alternative carefully attention to the options that are less than the option.
Here's an example. I switch with all those who are not in New York.
But it's what probably probably thinking.
There's this copy of Hamptons.
A place of sush.
Spiece of splendid. Ottim day.
Not anything. But what he thought is what he thought is is, "Well, the Agostod."
"All my neighbors in Manhattan are vie."
"I could talk about my front in front of the front of this."
And it spent two weeks from the idea that it's going to lost -- every day, -- every day, the possibility of parking where it wants to talk to you.
The cost opportunity to opportunity to what we have, even when the choice we have, even when the choice was excellent excell.
And more the options we have to consider them, the most carefully carefully attention to be cooopportunity.
Here's another example.
This view is a lot of things.
It speak of living the moment, and maybe of the living slowly.
But the most important point is that any of you choice, you choices you choices not do others.
The things that we don't choose have a lot of four that we do do less attement what we do.
Tero point, you expectative.
I tried on my pelle a new jeans.
Again, almost always jeans.
Once the jeans were just a type, and they were bought to be bestia, they were dissimis, only after they bring them a lot of a lot of times began to go well.
So, I went to buy a new couple when the old people were go, and I said, "I told me a couple of jeans, this is my cuteans, this is my cuteans, this is my cuteans, this is my cuteans, this is my cute."
And the bunch of the slim -- easy slim -- easy fit?"
She wants with the cerness or with the bottons "Stoneers?
"You want to roads?"
"Sotto the black or strettctis? Bla blay -- he was the bladed.
I was sleep, and after a little bit I was able to say, "I want the only guy -- that was the only guy -- that he was the only guy -- I didn't have any idea that I was so I was all of the jeans, and then I got the best jeans, and then I was the best jeans, with the best jeans, and I had ever had.
It was the mas. It was the choice had a bunch had the best one.
But I felt worst I worst worse.
Why? I wrote a book for the whole book for it.
The reason I was worst worst is that I was that with all the choice was that choice were altised altish altish had to be perfects.
And I started expectations minime. I didn't expected anything exceptional when he except only one guy, but when I saw a type of the type of it was perfect.
What I had water was good -- but not perfect.
And after I talked about what I was talking about what I was trying to insoon as I was going to confront to expectative.
The add of options in life of the people don't have to increase the expectations that these have respectives in the options.
And this will produce less sodddisftion, even when the results are good ones.
Nobody in the world of marketing if you make it content.
Because if you know that I don't know what I'm talking about.
The truth is more like this.
"You was better when he was worst when he was wors." The reason he was worst when he was worst when he was worst when he was worse that when he was worse was still possible to meet the surprised of the surprised sources.
Ogather, in the world we live -- opulent, industrialized citizens with expectancy -- the male we can hope is that things are at at the theize.
You have never surprised because you have never surprising your expectative, my waiting expectative.
The secret of happiness -- what you're here -- is what you're here -- "Baspectacancy -- "Yes, you want to do it it -- "Yes, you want to do it -- "Yes, "Yes,
I want to say -- little time audience -- I really am I I really want to be a spoke and my wife is really stuff --
I could not have a better I didn't get a better I didn't get it.
But I don't always do is a bad thing.
And finally, a consequence of the couple of jeans when there is only that jeans is that when you don't have to be the kind of despite in fact, and you ask you, "Why?"
"Who's responsible is cle?" "Who's responsid.
The world is responsible. What would I do do that?
When there are hundreds of jeans, and you buy a insodddhink a satisswim -- and you ask you who is responsible as you are responsible for yourself.
You might have a better better do better.
With hundreds of varieties are not going to success.
So when people are taking decisions, even if the result is a valized and damages they feel it and damages to their own own own their own own beings.
In the last years the depression is exploded in the industrialized world industrialized in the industrialized world in the industrialized the last few years of the industrialized in the last few years the depression is exploded in the last few years of the industrialized the industrialized in the last few years the
I think a meaningful factor -- not the unique, but important -- not the unique, but important -- of this depression is too much that people have experiences because the standard standard is too als.
And when they have to explain this situation thinking that the colp is there.
So the final result is that in general we're going to be better, but we feel worse about it.
Let me remind.
This is the offical dog, what we all take for good and it's completely false.
There is no doubt that a little bit of choice is better that I don't have that I don't have a lot of choice is better than a lot better than a little bit of a little bit better than a little bit of a little bit better than a little bit of a little bit of a little bit better than a lot of choice that I don't have a lot of choice.
There's a critic, magic value. I don't know what it is.
But I'm enough to be a piece that we have super-piece of the level that the best choices our lives.
Now, from the political point of view -- I almost until the police, the crumle is the following is the following point is the following point of the political point of the political point of view.
What allows you to all this choice in the industrial societies is the material is the material.
There are many places in the world, and you know that the problem isn't that they have too many places choice.
The problem is that they too much fall.
So the factors that I'm talking about is a malesclusive to the modern, societies are company is in the Western society.
And what makes you depressing and arrable is this: Steve Levitt talked about iers and seats seats and discomfortable seats are useful to be useful seat.
I want to say that these choices, complicated and dispendouble.
I'm a deleted deletes.
They make a worse.
If a little bit of what in our societies allows a lot of choice was reversed in those where people have too point, it would not only be their lives to be the news.
This is what economists call a better pareties are working a better pareties.
A redistributon is a red-red--- not only to poor poor -- not only to poor this choice in exctremely that it comes back to us.
And he said, "You can get all of the thing you want to get all of the thing that wants --
You know, people are culture, you think, "What do you do that fish the fish sky?
"It's obvious that you can't get anything in a glass of glass wall."
"A: One imagination, a light vision of the world."
and I was a little bit of the time in the beginning.
But then I think about that, instead, I realized that that the fish knows that the long.
Because the reality of facts is that if you eat the franks, so that "everything is possible." You can't get the freedom. You can't get the paraly.
If you rop the mouth that everything becomes possible to be possible the sodddisfation.
You get the parals: you get the parals; you reduce the well.
They all need a spring of a sphere.
This is almost certainly too stretch, perhaps even for us.
But the absence of some symbolic symbolic symbolic election for the inflicity -- for room indeed.
Thank you very much cure.
