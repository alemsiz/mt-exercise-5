And last year I showed these slide to show that the calotic to show that the calotic calculator, which for almost three million years had the size of 48 U.S. continents, is really, it's been rowed by 40-percent.
But that's the gravity of the gravity of the problem because it doesn't exhibition of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice problem.
The calculation is a very much of the climate system is a certain sense, the heart of climate system
You go and panding and reresit in the extremely
The next devices is going to be a fast folded the last 25 years.
The ice are lost of them are remarkable in red in red in red out.
As you see it, you expanding the blue blue both.
That's the ice in invernn't, which is rereturn into the extremely
You can see that the ice ice ice of five years or five years or more than five years or -- which here is like the bottom.
In 25 years of this is spent from this way.
This is a problem because the re-scale problem of the ground ground around the ocean to the ocean in the ocean artical of carbon on the microbian extra meters are transformed by microbian microbian microbian microbies.
And I think of the totality of the inquining atmosphere is a global warming of global warming, superthat is not going to reach it.
In some deep deep in Alaska meter in Alaska meter is already reflected by water.
The professorse Katey Walter of Alaska was was a very very small press of a very very last last last last inver.
Video: Wow! Al Gor: Look is if we are also going to be the us.
One reason is that this scale is that this scale scale by the Groenland, from the north.
This is a fluid records of the narrom of the country.
The laughed was never to reach levels of the side.
This is the Kangerlussua's in the South of the Groenlussudy.
If you want to know how to smoke, the sex of the ice of the ice of the ice here is where the mart.
These are increasing are increasingly.
And in the other part of the planet: Anttictic, the most big block of the planet.
The last month scientists have dibled that the bizarm is in negative negative, and the Antartide Western Western Western cut, which is particularly the slower in the sweet of the slower.
Equid six feet of the water, like in Groenles.
On Himalaya, the third biggest block of ice ice ice ice -- you see new laghand, who were ice ice --
The 40-percent of the world's population of the water water water from what it is the leaving of the money.
Other Ande: This ice is the bottom.
The ports is increased.
And so when I dimine it was going to be the water water water water water water water water
In California needed on the Sierra Nevada is diminute of 40.
The hydrogen are in crisis.
The previsions, as you read, are grave.
The growing growing in the world door to a narroad of inceneded by the mains.
The environment is increasing in the normal reaching out of the normal and without precedents.
Four sometimes more numbers in the last 30 years of precedented 75.
This is a slower of all insustainable of the whole insustainable of all insustainable of all insustain.
If you look at the context of the story, if you can see the consequences.
In the last five years we added 70 million tons of CO2 hours -- 25 million tons in the oceans every day.
Look at the Pacific, the Amermer, from the Amermer, and on the Amermer, and on the parts of the subcontinent -- where there is a roots of the ocean in the ocean in the ocean in the ocean in the ocean ans.
The more because of the global warming of global warming, and the deforestation, which is the use of the deforestation, is the use of the deforestation,
The oil, is a problem, and the carbon is even worse.
The United States are one of the two countries are a more emissions, together to China.
And it was propond of building many other cents of the carbon on the carbon.
But we're doing a change of direction.
These are the projects of the last years and some proposites of alternative proposes.
Anyway, there's a lott-political lotttremendous lot.
The carbon industries of the carbon and the last year 2250 million dollars in the last year to promote the carbon the last year to promote the water of the last year of the last year to promote the last year to promote of the last year to promoon the last year to promote the last year to promote the carbon on on
And this image I remember something.
Very Natal, in Tennespecially has been a lose of 3.8 billion glass of carbon dix.
Maybe you have seen on news of the news of the news of the news of the news ars.
This is the biggest fluses in America.
It's happened around Natal.
The published published of one of the industries was this thing.
Video: Frosty the carbon is a kind of coal is a kind of folded.
It's abundant here in America, and it makes our economy.
Frosty the carbon is more clear is more cleaner than the carbon on on the coast.
It's good preze, adorable, adorables and work on the hands.
Al Gore: From here is a big part of the West Virginia.
The most big society about the mountain in the mountay Coal. This is his friendly the friendly coal.
Video: Von Blland, Nancy Blland, NGo Gore Reid Reid -- not know what they're talking about.
Al Gore: So the Alleance for the Clima has a launched two campaign.
This is a fair, a part.
Video: Attor: The COALergives you the climate changes like a very very high to our business.
And this is to invest in the priority of money.
In fact, the carbon is not spore.
We think it's a good profume.
So not previous prehate change climate change here.
Let me do it.
Video: Attor: Carbone can be a lot of it.
So I do you take a whole structure in a structure of the carbon as the carbon on the carbon on the carbon a bunch of the carbon a whole structure.
Straordinary cars are a little roundate of the carbon technology of the carbon technology of the carbon the carbon the carbon of the carbon the carbon the carbon is a little bit of the carbon is a little bit of the carbon is the sound.
The main consummers is between the main the main of global warming technology of the carbon the carbon the carbon is all the way.
To an eyee is the odiern technology.
Al Gore: Infind, the alternative is the positive alternative to the economic and the national.
Video: The American is in the crisi; the economy, the economy, the physics crisi; the National crisis.
The movie of all the connection of our dipendence from the buster and the coal coal and oil is the matters of the oil.
Now, there's a new new one, you have a new solution,
Really 100 percent of the energy energy energy in 10 years.
A plan to report America to work -- to be more physics and help us to stop the reference of global warming.
Finally, a solution that basts to solve our problems.
Their America. Soocil more.
Al Gore: This is the ultimate one.
Video: He's reeating energy to America.
One of the fastest ways of porate to dependence the dependence of the dependence that are killed our planet.
Comparsa: The future is here. Vento, a new network.
Hewer: Novi investment for places of work for jobs for places of work for jobs.
And then they say, it's time to be realistists.
Al Gore: A old proverbio African old African African old hous: you want to go to the sun.
If you want to go back to the hell together."
We need to go back to the very quickly.
Thank you very much.
The last year at TED 10 to TED fit on LHC.
And it turns out to the paper to the paper on how it works the machine.
So I think it is. And for the other time you don't have no longer -- there is no biggest experiment, is the most scientific experiment, 17 miles of circcle.
His is to reate the reaction that were present in less than a billion plan universe -- until 600 million times a second.
All of this is just the environment.
This is the machine in Ginev.
We do these minminds of these minminminds in the rise of the river.
This is what I work. It's called AS -- is a 44 meters -- it's 44 meters and has a 22 meters of 22222-meters of 22 meters of 22 meters diamets.
This is a picture of ATLAS in building so you can see the proportion so you can see the proportion of the proportion of ATLAS in building so you can see the proportions.
The 10 sect of the last year we have accesse the machine for the first time.
And this picture was taken by ATLAS.
It was because of immense in the healthy of control.
It's a picture of the first fashion that had done all the around the LHC, in collision, deliberately, with a part of the LHC, and spreading particles.
In other words, when we see that the 10 sect of the 10 sect sector, we understand that the machine is a great living.
I don't know if it was this to make us more opposed to do it when someone went to Google and lives that the pages that the page.
What it means we had a culture impact on the scientific impact of what scientific is.
And it was a week later, there was a problem with the machine, I had to these movies here -- these movies here -- these movies are there.
These films are 13,000 feet when the machine is the massive six-food.
Now, the technical technical of you look at the movies and dirand, "It's not true. It's too underly."
And instead can do it because when they are very fredate cosident to the superconductors.
So, at least 271 grade, a nurture temperature in the room between the stars of the spaces can bring that the range can bring that cell of the room.
In one of the most of the most population of the most population in LHC, there was a difetrication.
So the movies are going to give you a little bit of suddenly meet a suddenly met a very unclear.
This was the result.
Now, this is still more impressive if you think these magnets, and that these magnets, and that are slows of about 30 centimetries.
It's damamaged about 50 magnets.
We had to take them to the way, what we did is done.
We have repristined and folded up and fold.
Now, they're going to be slowing all of their underground.
Entrue the end of the mart LHC will will be new inteer.
And we just look at it, and we expect to get the right or light-fall of the morning, and continue so our avventure to find what are the morning, which is the universe.
Now, of course, in a way, these fairs reaches the debate on the value, the debate of science and engineering of the engineering and engineering of the engineering of confident science and engineer to confut.
I think the fact that it's so difficult to go beyond the same limits, I think this is the value,
I want to conclude with the words of a scientist in the English Humphy Davy, the quality, image, image, image, image, the defesths of his pull, his pull, his pull, his pull, his pull, and he said, "No is so dangerous about the ideas of the human mind of the human mind and the ideas of the minds; that are not the same as a couple of the words of the ded, and our tries to be a trip of the defffed by the make, which is is is that our our own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own phonononononononous phonous phispspspspsprrrringinginginginginginging
Thank you.
I want to start asking you to start to rethink about how to do you get the couraged couraged cooking cooking cooking up to the morning.
As you get them to reach them as to the reach them, and they can get them and solve them to think and solve solve problems and solving the relationships.
The reason is to be foundly connected to the way we understand the world around us.
So, by informath informath of our interaction with objects of our interaction with the physics, and my collaborator Jevan Kalanithi, I started asking here: I started asking her: And then we are a computer, but when we are a computer, but when we are a computer of the digital dealing with a digital of the digital hour of the sand-like the smans, you could just have a little be,
and we system?
The question was so interesting that I decided we deal with the answer, building the Siftable.
And in a few words, a Siftable computer is a very big computer as a big.
And in a few words, a Siftable computer is a very big computer as a big.
You can move with the hand, they can see it with the hand, they feel the right movement and a radio wireless and a radio wireless and a radio wireless and a radio wireless to it.
But most of course, are objects like the morning, as the morning, you can just just make a little bit of the same mistake as well.
The Siftable is the example of a new ecost for a new ecost information digital information digital information.
And as they become more physics, consciously, consciously, the others, and they are the most physics, and they become more physics, and they are more physics, as well movement, as well as well as well as a function-functions.
I'm going to try to some simple example.
This is the Siftable is configured to show of the video -- if you wrote the video rooes of the other side side the other side side the other side side the other side side the other side side side the other side side the other side side the other side side of the video too.
These ritrates are interactive interactive interactive of others.
If they are really interested in the same thing is their intors.
If they get the circle and they can be a little bit of it.
If they get the circle and they can be a little bit of it.
They also have their movement and sinction.
We then realized that one of the interesting interesting implications of the interaction was the common on the data, as a disappearing, a color like if it was a color like it was a cold.
In this case, we have three Sift-configured as a saving and I can use them to the color in the middle of the color in the middle of the color in the middle of the color in the middle and I can use them to be a little bit of the color and I can use them to be a little bit of the color of the color of the color
and I can use them to slow them to the color in the central of the cut.
If we are too slowly, we can reach a little bit of it.
I'm also beautiful and possibility of apply to take the whole whole of the logical and games of logic and the whole thing to be trying to try and see the results of the things that are the results of the immediately things that are going to be the immediately.
Now I'm going to be --
This is a Fibonaces that I do with a company that I do with a company of equations.
We have a game game of the words of Scarabeum and Boggle.
And of course, in every turnner, in case on every Siftable, Pratically, in every Siftable, Pratically, every Siftable, and if you try to a dictionaries on a dictionary.
And then, after about 30 seconds of remiss and a new new slecting and new chance to try to try to try to try and new chance to try to prove and new chance to try to provide and new possibility of reading and new possibilities.
Thank you.
Here's what the kids were in the Media Lab, I did it in the Media Lab, I did them out of the video
They are very pleasure a lot of thing.
And one of the interesting things of this kind of interesting is that you don't have to give people many education.
You just say, "He's going to be the word," and their own own own exactly what to do.
That's what other people who try it.
This is our betters more young people to go to the dealth.
And it was just just a cutting them.
They just were going to be morning, for him.
Now, this is an applied apply a cartone interactive carting.
We wanted to build a tool, for the ling's apapply of the ling's Felix.
It can be able to new characters in the scene, solliant to the Siftable to their own own associated with their own associated with their own own associated with the Siftable to new characters in the scene.
It can be able to new characters in the scene, solliant to the Siftable to their own own associated with their own associated with their own own associated with the Siftable to new characters in the scene.
And that's what it turns out the sold.
Video: The sole is surging.
David Merrill: Now he brought a treatment in the scene.
Video: Video: The treatment of it.
Bel work!
So schools are Siftable and put the neighbors can interact the characters --
Video: Bau!
And in the story.
Video: Ho!
DM: It's a story with final final final one.
DM: It's a story with final final final one.
Vololer: Vola --
DM: The last example I have time to show you is a tool, I did a tool, to be a recent music.
It's a tool, I did recently fair, to be a lot of slowing music.
The Siftable here is the sounds as a base, based and the bacteria as the bacteria as the bacteria as the bacteria as a suck.
Every one of these has four different variations, and you can chook what use to use it.
You can insert these sounds in a consequence of comporate to your pleasure as well.
And it just just to take a sounds a sounds a "Rededed."
These are actually actually control from live in the live in the living and the movie.
They attacks to a particular suit to a particular and then sincls to the folks to the same way.
And then there are the general effects like time and fly a long time.
We look like this.
Video: DM: We will try to put a couple in two Siftable in two Siftable "Rededed," we add the other bases.
Now I just put a blow.
Video: DM: Now I add percent of ussionate --
Video: And now I'll put the movie to the bacteria, so I can control the whole thing from the live in the live of the live in the living here.
Video: DM: I can speak the whole time by a late or time by a late or from the other.
Video: And now I add the movie of the bottom of expression.
Video: DM: I can recombined the sequence "fly the next thing to the vole."
So I don't have to planned the first one of the first longer than the longer or more correct than the longer longer or more cord.
And now, finally, I can sfue the whole sequence in the left Sifty "Filate "volume."
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is to build new interfaces more likely to be more likely to be a lot of how to work.
And today, I had time to show you one of the results of this lost is some possibility that we try to bring out from the lab lab of the lab of the lab of the lab of this lost results of this lost one of the way we try to show you one of the way we can try to be a way of the lab of this lost of time.
The concept I want to transmimit is that it's coming this new generation of objects to interact with digital digital media media media media in our world.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the now I'm not talking about all of you.
I'm a writer.
And I want to be books is my professional extract is more than that, obviously.
It's also the love and the whole whole whole of my life.
And I don't expect that it can change here.
But I said that, something particularly happened to my life and my career and in my career and I took me to rericalibrate the whole whole whole relationship with this work.
The particular thing is I recently wrote this book, this biography called "Mangia, Pregion, "Mangia, Pregion, different from my precedents, so I was a big big big reason to be a big big big big things that was going to be a big big big -- and he became a big big big explanation.
And the result is that everyone vaded, people who were condent as if they were condent as if they were condent as if they were condent as if they were condent as if they were condent as if they were condent as if they were condent as if they were condent me as if they were condent as if they were condent as if they were as if they were condcerned as if they were condous.
I mean, it's a real -- condent --
They are they going to be all worried and say, "You don't have to do it not be able to do bet?
You don't have to keep writing to write all of life without being able to create a book that can be able to create a book that can you have to something?"
which can important somebody?"
It's rangering, you know it.
But it could go worst in the worst thing about 20 years ago, when I started to say people -- I was a writing -- I wanted to be a writer.
I went to the same reaction of the same reaction from the land.
And people say, "Don't you know, "Don't do it?
You don't have a folding that the million?
You don't have to do this mestiate for all the whole life without the whole life without any life without any slows on a heart of every infranck with the hairs of failure?"
And so, you know it.
The question is, "To answer to all these questions is ""Hi."
And I have to all of those things.
I had always been a land.
And I also have a lot of other things that people can't be not ind.
As the tree and other things that are slow.
But as it is about about what I was writing and I asked me to me, and I asked me to me, why is it be?
Is it ration?
It's logical that anyone who knows what it is.
But what is that particularly in the impresecreative to make us about the healthy of the healthy in a way that other career doesn't fit to not phananno?
As my father, for example, he was a chimming and not remember one time in his 40 years of his own activity where he was asked if he had been a engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be a channel,
And there was never -- what block about engineer than the engineer it?
And it wasn't what does it happen?
Of course, the engineers are chemical engineers as they don't have certain couraged the reputation of being being alcouraged the depressizes of being treated.
We weren't just this reputation and not only writers but creatives to all generate, we have this reputation of being enormously as a huge stopped as as a huge reputting of every general reputation of every generally, we have this reputting reputation of every generation,
And it's not the other thing to look at the triste of the magnificent death of the magnificent century, only in the 1th century, they often often often hold them.
And also the ones that are not suicide that are really disappeared by their women.
Norman Mailer, before I did, in the last whole view said, "I was a little bit more than my bookey has killed a little bit more extraordinary about the work of life.
But we don't get the top of the first of them when we heard these things like you know, so we heard these things have completely interiorized and accepty the notion that creativity is some kind of hand, and that the ard, and that the ard, and it will be on the hang of the goat.
And the question I want to do all of the thing is, are you agree with this ide?
You know, you have to do it because you look at a centimeter distance to me not good.
I think it's odiose.
And I think it's also dangerous and I don't want to see the next century.
I think it's better to encourage our great creative mind.
And I know that in my case -- in my case -- in my case -- it would be very dangerous as well as to the same suppositions, more expensive the circumstances in the career.
Of course, -- insome, I'm rather young people, I have about 40 years.
I still have about four decade of work in me.
And it's very likely to do anything that would write it will be right now in the world as the work that used after the work that used after the last book.
And he was slavery, because we are all the more or here -- it's likely my greatest successful is to my greatest successful shedoes.
Oh, Ges: Oh, Ges!
You know this is the kind of thinking that leads a person to start to be, to be bing in the morning of the morning and I don't want to do it.
I would continue to do this work we do.
So, the question become the question of be?
And so so I was a lot of reflected, which the way to continue to write is to write a psychological costructure, right?
I had somehow to find a distance of physics between me, which I'm writing the whole thing to see if I wrote the rest of what reaction is about what he was trying to look at the time, as I started to look at the time, trying to find other things to see if they could have to be able to see if they could have more and more and more healthth-blood ideas and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and
to help people believe the people creative to create the risks of the creative creativity.
And that research has brought me to the old old and ancient me for Roomom.
And I want to be in the circle and then you go back back back.
Nellellow Great and ancient Roma -- people don't look at the creativity that creativity came to the men are in the men are inhere?
And it was thought that creativity was this spirit and that came out of the men who came from a few of men from a few of people distant and unknown as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as as well as as well as well as a few delights, and they are in the knowledge and unknown as as as they are in the knowledge.
The grew of the spirits would be the spirits of creativity "demony."
And I think, wonderful wonderful as a demone that elargives a smoke.
The Romans were the same idea, but they call that the spirit of the spirit without a gene.
The big is that it's great, because the Romans didn't think a gene gene was a particular arror gue was somebody in the same intelligen.
They believe that a gene of this was this kind of entity in the wrote that I was literally in the last last months of a artist, a little like the elf of a little bit like the elf of the argument and modeling of the article and modeling the result of that work.
Each -- -- -- -- -- -- -- this is the distance of what word, the cool of the psychological that cool protects of your work.
And all of them knew that was so that it works -- right?
So the artists were protons were protons of certain things, like for the too narcisided, right?
If your work was exceptional doesn't take it to the mer, all of the mer, all knew that they were helped by this genininincorpored.
If your work fail, it wasn't all colord, right?
Everybody knew that was your gene to be a unable inable inability to be a unable inable inable inability to be a unable inable inable inable inability to be a unable inable inability to be a unable inable inable inability to be a unable inable inable inable inable.
And so people han concepts the creativity in Occident for a long time.
And then the Rususes came and all of the whole idea; we put the great idea; we put the center of the universe in the middle of the universe and no more release that writes the details that write devices.
This was the most of the human rational and people begin to think that creativity was completely the ished by the whole slide.
And for the first time in history, you know, I started to reference this or a gene of a rather than a person who is a rather than a person with the genius.
And I have to tell you, I think was a big mistake
I think I lost someone, a simple person to believe of being as a recicient as the found, the same mysteries of all the mysteries of all the mysteries is a responsibility to the fragile is a very big deality to the fragile that human.
It's like to ask someone to ingoid the soles.
I degree and I believe all these ingestiable ingestiable to all these ingestiable ingestiable to lose the lost and the local of the load of the local and creates all of these ingestiable ingestiable ingestiable to all of these ingestiable ingestiable ingestiable ingestiable to all of these ingestiable ingestiable ingestimate in the land.
And I think was this pressure to have been been in the past.
And if this is true, and I think the question is the question becoming there, and you?
We can do it different things.
And as you go back to a more antic understanding of the relationship between humans and creative creativity.
Or perhaps not.
Maybe we can't be able to 500 years of thinking about 500 years of thinking about a 18 minutes.
And there are people in the audience that sollend, it would be legitties on the notion of the notion of the notion of the same things that following people are going to be the next project.
And I will probably not be going to be all about this thing.
But the question I would like to do is -- why is it -- why is you know?
Why don't I think about this way?
Because it has more more than every other thing that never heard to explore the explans of creativity of creative process of creativity.
One process that I ever ever did I have ever done to do something -- so fundamentally, all here -- yet, you don't think of it doesn't been.
And in fact, you know, sometimes it seems to be completely woranthy.
I did this indicated with the extraordinary poetry, which has now 90 years, but that has been a poet-year-old life and I said, if you were in his infected in the range of the Virginia, and I felt in the cam, and I felt in the field.
And I said that was like a fragorous fragorous fragorous fragorous phrry.
And that was coming to the rotolding to her from from the land.
And I felt that it was going to be requite.
You know, you have one thing to do to do that point and was words like a morn."
And so it goes to the house and was initive from this poetc, and he didn't have to take a piece of cars and a pieces of cars and a math hold and the tradition, the training of the page.
And three times not that was very quickly and correct reach and correct reach to the house and the rounded in the house and the rounced her and she was going to stay through the landscape and she was going to stay through the landscape, as if she said, "another poet."
And then there were the time, this piece of paper, I'm going to be -- there were the time -- there were almost loper, right?
So, he was going to go home and he was trying to the car, and he was going to go through the tears in the time when he was was as if you were in the other hand, and the other hand, and the other hand, and the other hand, and the around.
And it was the office of the courage and the reduced in his body.
And in these hously, the poesthy would be presented on the pages and four, from the last word at the last word at the first word at the first word at the first word at the first word of the last word at the first word of the last word of the last word at the first of the last word at the first word of the last word at the first thing to the last word of the first thing to the first time.
So when I feel about it, it's pathesis, it's exactly the fair, is exactly the creative process of my creative process of creative process --
I don't all my creative process -- they're not a conduction of it.
I'm a mult, and my way of work is a lot of work is going to be the same orary every day and go to the slow and go to the walk on the hold and go to the hold and go to the same time.
But I even even even my headline, I was a fixed against the things --
And I imagine that many of you have a lot of of you have a lot of you know.
You know, even if the work and ideas came to me and ideas were going to be a kind of a very untremely saye.
And what is this thing?
And how can we relate to the way to not give us the head, pluttoster, which you make it stain?
And so I really, the best example of the contemporary that I have is the musician Tom Waits, which I interviewed a day.
We were talking about this, and you know, Tom, for the most life was the most life was the incarnation of the argument is going to control these species, to control these species of impull impulses of impulses of impulses of embeyond.
But then it was a day and a day was driving day when she was driving on the way was driving to the Los Angeles, changed all for him.
And it was going to be in the sent of a sent track, which is the southdia, which comes into his heads as it does the inspiration, and the enthusize, and the wish is the wish, and the wish and the wide, but it doesn't know how to take it is.
It doesn't have a car, it doesn't have a matite, it doesn't have a record.
So I started to hear this kind of old antum growing in him in him and he said, "I'm going to lose it, and remarred by this song glass from this song song of this song gasassumed by this song ge.
I don't am enough to do not quite good and I can't do it.
And instead of go into the panic hair.
And he was going to be completely new process and he did something completely new process of a completely new thing.
And he just said, "Hey, don't see it is, I don't see what I'm driving you do?"
"Do you know, does it write a song song --
If you really want to be a more opported time a more opporting when I can take care of you.
And I triments, you go to the one today.
I wanted to the Leonard Cohen."
And his process working working on the whole work.
I don't work was even even even even even how it was even even even even even even how it was the work.
But the process and the fishing of the heaving was releaved when the previous genius, the genius, the genius, he was going to be a load behind the back back from where it was going to be a whole thing that he had to be a whole thing.
but it switched, wonderful becauses a collaboration of a conversation between Tom and this strange and this strange is that he didn't lost that was Tom.
So how to do the story of what is to change a little bit of the way I was working and already been save me a time.
This idea, I was writing when I was writing "Mangia, Prega, and the Amama," and the fall of the disperation that we are working on something and we don't have to think that will be a disaster, which is going to think that will be the worst worst book that will be the worst one is going to be the worth ever writing.
Not just good at the worst book book --
And I started to think of to the project.
But then I remember Tom I talk about Tom I talk about it.
So I szed my face, in the hands of my own own comments to a corner of the room.
And he said, "You know, you know, you know, if this book is not going to be brilliant not will be a brilliant hous?
Because as I see what hand, I don't have more than I haven't more than that.
So if you want to be better -- you have to talk about your parts.
Okay. But if you don't know what I don't know about it.
I'm going to write my own work because it's my work.
And I would like to favor that was recorded to do my word," because -- -- the end of the North is the end of the North Africa is -- seats people in the North Africa are the desert of the North of the North -- and the clear, and music, and the sacred to the treatment of the tree.
And they were always magnificent, because the ballers were professional professions and were fantastic.
But every tant, I think, something happened, and one of these artists became in translate in the reality was actually translate in translate it.
And I know what I know about what I know is that you have seen the point of a point, a lost point, a lost point.
And it was like the time you stop the time in the walk through a lecture of baller-hold hold hand, as the 1,000 night halls -- but all of the slow halls up.
And suddenly not just like a human being.
But you have accepty in the dead in the death of the divvessels of divves.
And when this happened, you know, the time people knew what it was -- they call it with his name.
They were the handle and they started to canted, "Allah, Doh, Dod Goe, Doh, God God, God."
That's what it is.
And the most historical -- when Mr. Mororder, they were the Spage of Spaa, they were the douths of their own calculation in the seats of "Allah, I mean, I think, "Oh, yet, "Yes, which you can still hear in the corries or in the corride or in the body.
In Spay is that when a artist has done something impossible and magic -- "Thah, magnificent -- one -- one -- one -- one of the last last last last last last last last last last last last last last last last last last last last last last last last last last last last last last of God.
And it's a big thing because we have to have it.
But the problem comes comes the day later, for the ballery itself, when you sweep, and he found it are the 11 of Marteded in the morning, and last last last year.
It's just a mortal demal with a big demal with a male deal with that ality.
And perhaps nobody will be the name of God as it is.
It's hard to it.
This is one of the most pathose,
But perhaps it has to be so angotising, if you could not believe it, you don't believe that the most extraordinary of your being being from you are from you to be so much of you are from you stession to you.
But I believe that are the data in prester from a foundation of this team of your life that is the part of your life that you have to have a little bit when you find.
And you know, if we think of this is in this way to change here.
And so I started thinking about it, and it's sure as I think about a different months during the work of the book that audience was the very very good for the book that was going to be a big chair, pusushing of my greatest --
And what I have to keep to tell me when I feel that I feel that it doesn't have a hair.
I don't have to do it just just your work.
And I think you can be to presenting you for your parts, any can be there.
If your work is ball-bally.
If the divin, I assumpting the delight-sheded decide of this wonderful time, for a very wonderful time through your own own tubes, then "Oh, then "Oh, then yeah, then "Oh, then "Oh, yeah.
And I triments, I got the same thing to you.
And "Oh, yeah.
I think I don't think I have to teach it.
"Oh, yeah, even for the human beings, and heads of the tunes of talks to do you just want to be presenting to continue.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
And as you know I've been talking about some of these projects on the genome of the human genomes of new genes.
Now we're starting a new lose new los: we started digitalize the biologist and now to the digital modrug of the biologist, we are in a new fasthetizing and sintetizing life.
We always try to do big questions.
"What is the lives?" is something that many biologists I think they have to understand the varargues of lives.
We tried different approach, reducing the minimes of ters.
We're digitalize by almost 20 years ormas.
When we sequenced the genome of the world is going to go from the world from the the digital world of the digital world of the computer.
Now we can regenerate the life, or create new life of this universe is to digital digit?
This is the map of a little organisms, the Mycoplasma gene of the genome of the genome of those that can authoring in the lab of the lab of the lab of a little bit more small organisms.
And we tried to reduce the genome of creating a little bit more smaller than one still smaller than that.
We are able to eliminate a hundred of the genes of about 500 of the 500 of the 500 of the 500 of the 500 of the 500 of the same thing that are here.
But when we take a metabolic map metabolic metholic respect to the noundly respect to the nound.
I think that's simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate a time, is very unlikely to be able to bring a cellure.
So we decided that the only demonstring that the only sintetize this cromosomed a way that we deal with some of these questions to make some of these questions to some of these questions of these questions
And so we started the windweddly we can sintetize a sky?"
Can you feel that you feel to produce these great molecular moleces that are never able to create before you do it before you do the earth?
And in case of it, we can make a take?
A mountain is just a chair.
The speed that we are able to digitalize life is growing the life is growing to be a very very exponential exponential life is growing to be able to digitalize the very very quickly growing to be a very quickly growing to the very quickly growing in the digitalize life is growing to be able to digitalize the growing
Our ability to write the genetic code code of the genetic code of course, it's better than it is better than it is.
And our most recent results the ports of a curve current exponential curve current of the most recent results of the most recent results of the most recent results of the most recent results of the most recent results of the most recent results of the most recent results of a curve.
We started 15 years ago.
The process has required a lot of step with a bioetic revision before we started with a bioetic experiments.
But we found that I think we can see the DNA is very difficult to the DNA is very difficult to be very difficult to be very difficult to be very difficult to be very difficult to be very difficult to be very difficult to be very difficult to be very difficult to be very difficult to be very difficult to be very difficult to be very difficult to be very
There are decade of thousands of cars in the world that produces of DNA, the longer of the longer of 30 to 50 beyond and is a degenerative process is the most errorder, more mistakers are there.
So we had to develop a new metothod, and correct reaching the mistake of the mistake of the mistake of the mistake of the mistake of the mistake of the mistake of the mistake of the mistake of the mistake and correct of the mistic and reaching the mistake
And this was our first point of our first point of the digital genome of Phi 174.
It's a little virus that kills kills that bacters.
We designed the framments, effectively the revolution and get a molecules and a molecules of about 5,000 literally.
The interesting part of is when we took this pieces and we insert it in the bacteria and we insert it into the bacteria and deal with this genetic and proprices of the particles and proprices of virals.
The particles are actually release are release from cells, and they go back and they distruct the Ecover Ecover and they distruct the Ecover of them.
I talked about recent with members of the industries of the industries that their own own own pattern.
They have more than you.
We believe that this is a situation where the software can actually build his own hardware in a biological system.
But we wanted to do the biggest things in the big things in the big thing.
We wanted to build the entire cromosome of the bacteria
I'm more than 580 mile of code code code of code code code genetic code of the code code of the code code of the code code code of the code code genetic code of the code code code code of the code code code of genetic code code code code
So we thought we have to build it in the virus, so that we can change the virus, so that they can change the cell of a cellula in a cellula live in the vivent.
The projection is crucial project, and if we start with the digital computer, these have to be very accururate to be very accurururate to be very accurururate with the digital computer, these are very accurururation.
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 the leness of a mistake of a mistake for every 10 miles.
We found that is, 30 mistake it was going to use that the original sequence was not going to be able to do it work.
One part of the process is designing segments that are 50 characters of 50 characs of 50 lecting 50 ls of 50 characters of 50 lecting over 50 lectures to be a little bit of small that work together.
We try to be a lot of the same thing.
You probably have a lesson that we desert us of the big.
Think of it, we have a genetic code on four literally, C, C, C, G, G: G: G: G: G: G.
Those of those reading were blood with about 20 friends about 20 friends of reading for every friends for every friends for every friends.
So we can use the genetic to write words, frains, thought, you know, thinking.
What we did we have been authographic was self-to do that.
Some were deluses were the fact that it was not a poet.
We designed these segments for a few terms of them just just to be unique.
There are employes that reparents and put them on it.
And we started to resembling with the parts, starting with five to seven miles, the literally, unends in a way to form their lyming segments to 72 millyming the literal literally.
And every step we have been produced these segments in the abundance so that we're trying to create a proception of create a proception -- as you see in a minute.
We are trying to automatic the process.
So, this seems the tabellow a fall of a basket.
When we get to these segments in these segments are more than 100 mile is going to be in the Eastern East.
You get the modern of modern tools of modern biology molecular biology of the biology of the biology of the modern tools.
So we have been considered to other mechanisms.
We know about another multimatity called recombination called recombination of the biology is going to be able to reach the DNA to reform the DNA in the segments.
Here's a example.
This organisms, called Deinocock radio eight million rad of radiation.
You can see in the rise of the danger as his own own own mosome.
In 12 -- 24 hours is resembled exactly how it was the first time.
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do it.
These organisms can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to touch it.
They can live under a fair.
I'm absolutely sure that life is in space, and smokers to find new environments of water.
And I mean the NASA has showed that this avenes.
This is a molecular image of the molecular procession of the molecule of the segments with the design of the segments from inserious segments from inserious inher.
The lights them assemble automatically.
This picture was not been taken with a microscope, but with a microscope, but with a microscope.
It's a molecular molecular so we can see the with a microscope.
These are pictures that cover a lot of six seconds of about six second.
This is the publishing that we did a little bit of time ago.
It's more than 580,000 reads of code code code code here.
It's the most big thing of a definitely construcstructed by the man ever created by the man ever created by the man ever created by the man ever created by the man ever a lot of the most big structure of the most big structure.
It has a lot of ecolate sanger to 300 million people.
If you stamp it with a career despite in the 10 without spaces, there would be a 42 pages just to transcent this code code this genetic code is genetic to be a genetic career to the genetic paints, you know, a 42 pages just to be a 42 pages of the genetic paper.
Now, how do we work? How can we do it work?
Of course, tramite a virus is a game from the girls.
It's a little more complicated when they use of the bacteria
It's simplest when it's about cells as our eucarioes like our re: you can just except the nuclear and inserved, which is basically the process of clone.
In the bacteria is the mosome, it's integrated into the cell, but we recently showed that we are able to do a trapic trapic cell of a mosome cell and a mountain to another and activity to the other and activity to the whole thing of activity is to the mosome.
We have a microbic mountasting from a microbial microbial species of a microbial microbial microbial mosome.
The two are different of the topies.
We have added some more in a way that we can decide what you can choose to the romound.
And then it has the seximes to kill all the protects of the proteins.
And when we put in the cellula was stupend -- and we appreciate our graphy graphy of the graphy is going to go into the cell.
And we were really thinking that we can't go to the text of the desping us in the laughter in the lous.
This is one of the most execection of evolution.
We found that very much species have added a second or a third a third a third a few parts, adding a few parts, I added up in a second thousands of new tracks in a second species.
So what you think about evolution as a gene gene to the time you have a gene of the biologia.
They are of the improof of the re-re-re-re-re-in-re-in-re-in-construction is that the DNA.
The mosomsome that was in the cellula doesn't have a one.
The cells of the cell pha-to-tails that we have inserved.
It's expressesed, and it has recognized the other hand, has the except as it was a mostly had, and we were return with the cell and the new cell cell the new cell and the new mountast.
It's become blue because of the genes that we have inserved.
And in a short lash of time, all the characteristics of a kind of a kind of a new species, and it's transformed in a new species, based on the new software that we insert in the cell.
All the protects are changed, members are changed, and when we read the genetic cost of the equivalent of what we have transference.
Now, this might be genetic alchemical alchemical software are we going to change things in a pretty substantial.
Now, I already explaned that you don't talk about genesis -- but of the three million years and a half million years and a half of evolution, and I said that maybe we're going to create a new version of the explosion of Cambrian explosion of this digital process of new species on this digital process of this digital process of the digital process of this digital process of digital explosion of this digital process of the digital
Why do you do that?
I think it's obvious enough when we think of our necessity.
We are to go from six billion people in the next 40 years.
Just to give you a example: I was born in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for each one has been in 1946; 40 years, you are going to be there.
We are now now to find the top of the water and blood water and bines and bins and bines and a half billion people.
It's still more difficult to do it for nove a billion years.
We use more than five billion bunch of carbon of the oots of the olid.
That means millions of barrent bars at the day.
When I try to find biological process, or whatever the biologists of the biologists of me.
And we have to have to deal of all the whole CO2 from these materials that it fits into the atmosphere.
At the day of the scientific discoveres in all the world, we have a data with about 20 million genes, and I like to think of the design components for the future.
The electronic industry has just a dozen of components, and think about things are selling out of different things are come out.
Our limits of the biological data is the biologists and our imagination.
Now we have the techniques of fast fast of the fast sintetization, we can create what we call a genomic combination of combination.
We are able to build a big robots that can produce a million cromosomes a day.
Think of this 20 million genes of different or of trying to try to try to try to try to try to make either drug or drug -- we can change a little theam, we can change a little bit more biologiology that in the last 20 years of science.
And it's just a lesson a standard.
We can take to chance to survive, production or of carbon dixide or of the coast vaccines of vaccines --
This is an instantanea of some software are we working on the computers that we're working to be able to be able to be able to the computer.
Well, we don't know what it is.
We know exactly what their genetic code code code code code of the genetic code code code of the genetic code code code code code code code code of the genetic code code of the genetic code.
Now we're going to be on the fourth generation.
You also see you also you have to be a fall from the grassassroom.
We have carbon on more and third generation that will use enough to use enough to be the carbon on the highest level of the highest value of the highest fair.
But the only way the biologists can have a big impact without increasing the cost of food and limited the cost of food and limited the whole thing is going to be transforming the CO2 in material we are working for designing cells that can be able to take this purpose of quarter generation in about 18 months.
The only combined with CO2 is a metodow, in our discoveries in our discoveries in the world, we found different metoes.
This is a organism that we debed in 1996.
And in the ocean of the deep ocean temperature of the temperature of the water temperature of water.
They believe it from CO2 using hydrogenen molecular as a molecular amount of energy.
We are trying to understand if we can inch the CO2, which can easily be transported by the CO2 in the carbon and the carbon the carbon the bottom of the ocean in the carbon is the process of the CO2 in the carbon the bottom of the CO2 in the carbon and the CO2 in the carbon and the CO2 in the carbon and the carbon on and gone in the carbon on on the carbon on on the CO222,
So we think about a short we might be able to increase what the question of "What is the most of the basic is Noes, the Noe, true of repeated, we have the whole industry to repeate the whole industry to repeate the whole industry.
And yeah. If you don't do it from TED, where you can do it
It would be a main the bottom.
And we are working for the same metoes of methods to create vaccines of plants.
You saw this year with influence, we are always back to a year and a year in less when it is to find the vaccine in the right thing.
I think what you can change in a combinable combinable of the anticips.
And this is how the future could start changing now, the tree of evolution, acceless evolution, accelerate evolution with bacteria and inally, cells and inally, cells cells can be
We are so so that we have to make people.
Our purpose is to do enough to live enough to try to try to try to try to try to try to do it.
And I first will give you a lot of the fastest technology, some fundamental work of the new technology that we've brought to a very water, a very water, it's a year of a year is Seadragon.
It's a local of a local level that you can interact with a local amount of data data in the same thing.
We're seeing a lot of a lot of a lot of digital photos with a digital kind of zoom and continue, for a speaking and continue, in the whole speakers as we want to do.
And not important as big as much of information that we see is the big amount of data or things that we see is the big thing or images.
most of the most of the digital photographs, but this is a provided by the Bible prosperent from the Bible of Congress, and reenter in the legs of 300 miles in the legs of the Congress,
It's not a very different because the only thing that are the prestations of a system of plants like this is the number of pixel on the screen. It's also a very flexible architecture in any time.
This is a book of data not images.
This is the Casa desolated of Dickens. Every colonna represents a capital.
And so I just show you that is just to show you that is not image, we can do something about the generally, that is a representation of the head, not of a photoes.
It could be a little artificial way a law a book for a very slide.
I don't have the folk.
This is a more realistic example of the number of of the Guardian.
Every big image is the beginning of a severtion.
And it really really really like you and the beauty experience of a folding a version of a quote of a quote of a quote of a quote of a molecules of a lot of kind of meeting.
We also have done something with the number of this particular number of this particular particular Guardian.
We have a fashired by the others of solved -- more than the fact that you use in a normal normal published -- and we insert in the content -- and we insert in the content of the content -- and we insert in a normal fair.
If you want to see the characters of this automobile, you can see here.
Or other models, or even the specific phrry,
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on the screen.
We hope that this lemifies to put a little bit of the pop-dollar pop-in-dollar as a remarkable to be necessary.
Of course, the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology.
And on this doesn't want to lose time, if we don't mean that we have contributed to the came.
These are all the streets in the United States in the U.N.
So now we're going to be a bit more than that.
This is now from the journey of the webs; you can go to see it.
It's a project called Photosynth, which fight two different technology.
One is Seadragon and the other is a very interesting visual computer research by Noah Snavign University of Washington, with the help of the University of Washington, with the Resears of Microsoft and Microsoft Microsoft Research of Microsoft Resear.
And it's from the journey managed by Seadragon.
You can see it when we do this kind of pattern that we can go from a picture of the other and have this kind of experienced experience.
But the space, the space, the space, has actually a meaningful meaning.
The lags of visualization of computers have recorded these images together, so that they have been doing the places that are removed to the laghi Grases -- all of the Montags of the Montags of the Moundly -- are a slide-stable image of a slide-stable image of a slide-with the idea of a slide of space.
I don't know if I don't know if I have time to show you some other environment.
There are some more space.
I want to go directly to one of the original data from Noahand, this is from a precedent of Photoynthetic Photoynthrying for the first time -- to show you what is really the last time -- to show you what is the next thing behind this technology, Phosyn’t going to be the right right right now.
We had to worry about the legal aspects and reach them.
This is a reconstruction of Notos Dececk images by Flicken images from Flicken Nots Dame in Flickr and you get images of the camps, and you get images of these things that is a picture of these concerned -- and I say that it is a picture that it is discovered to the image.
So I'm all sorts of Flickr and have been all of space,
And it's possible to navigate in this simple way.
You know, I never thought I would never think of finish to work for Microsoft.
It's very frefe to received this kind of more account here.
I think you can see that it's a lot of different types of different types of photoes of the phones to those professional phones in this environment.
And if you can try and try to try and try to those more stranges.
Most are block by factor, etc.
And then a few part of here is a series of photographs -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
This is a poster of Notber Dame recorded in the U.S.
We can go from the poster of this environment.
The essential point is that we can do the social environment. This is now is actually actually actually remarkable data from everywhere.
All those pictures become connected together, more than the parts.
You have a model of the earth of the emerge.
Think about this as a long promote of Stephen Lawler on Earth virtual virtual virtual
It's something that growing in complexity as people as well as people are using the uses that are uses to be increasinges with the use.
Their pictures are brought by other people.
If anybody is the idea of conventing all of these sants say the not, my picture of Noth Most Decrent DDecrent Dech of all those dates, and I can use how to use the point of the re-hush for the same way of everyone else in that universe, and in that one of the other other other side of the red red red and the red of everyone -- and the red of the red s-use of the red re-mote and the red of the re-modrum-modrug-mote image, and to the scale of the s-use of the s-use of the red re-hing of these these
Of course, a consequence of all of the most of all of the most interesting of the term, of every interesting part of the term, and the slower and from images and from the satellitaries and a million six, but by the memory of the remarkable of the groups of all of the most interesting is the sense of all of the most interesting of the most of the extreme of all of the most interesting is of the most interesting than the most interesting of the extract of the most of the extretreme of the most interesting interesting interesting interesting interesting is is is is is is is is of the most of the most most most most of the most of the most of the most of the
Mille thank you.
Chris Anderson: I realized what? What your software you to do is that in the next few years, all the next years, in the next years, all the pictures of the next time, all the pictures of everyone in the world or will be connect?
Bood. What is doing is doing it is actually discover it.
It's a creating of the hyperlink, if you want to be with images.
And it's doing it in the content content of the content of images.
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the rich of information is very much of these images of these images of these images of these images of these images of these images of these images of these images of these images of these images that many of these images of these images of these images of these images of these images.
As you have a research of images on the web, you know, a fit on the pages of the page of the pictures of the pictures of the pictures of the pictures of the pictures of the pictures of the pictures of the picture.
Now, what happens if that pictures you connect to all your eye?
So the amount of interconnection of the whole connection and the amount of resemant, is really enormous classical is really a classical classical classical effect.
CA: Blaise, it's really incredible.
Book, I'll you thank you very much.

The consequence of a particular kind of choice to adapt that our stirs has done a lot of generations ago.
And of course, we all share we all share the essential track.
All we are. All right.
We are the subjects of the beginning.
We have to deathorability of more, so we don't take it if we go and whale and whales --
We all have a art.
What it is the particular range is the particular of the can, the range of every culture.
Not important that are the last pencivil of Bornew, or the Voodoor of Haiti, or the Voodoor in Kenya secentrion Kenya secentrional camps, or a camel.
He was my company in the desert in the desert a month ago, or a lastern in the valls of the Mests of the world.
All of these populations teachers are other ways of thinking about there are other ways of thinking about it, other ways of things that are in the world.
And if you reflected a time, it's a concept that can give you hope.
Insides, the mirration of cultures of the world creating a spiritual spiritual and cultural cultural and culturning the planet and culturning is the raildy of the planet as the rail.
And you can think about this raildy as a hetnos; it can be in the same as a very very well as a total as a total phone of all the conceptures of all the conceptures of the human conscience, intuition from the imagination of the tree.
The great pathetnow's great.

Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some things I wrote in this book that I hope you have heard and I'm going to be and proverse them to the other lines, in the case not noctast.
I want to start with what I call "the dogma official."
The official official official of thing?
The official official of all the industrial society y is the official official official benefit is a very mass of our city, "If we want to be a massive program to be the freedog."
The reason is a late, in the fact that the liberty is in the same site is the same one value, is prepreted, it's prepreted, essential for humans.
And in the other is in the fact that if we are free, each of us can act to do all of us to do all of the benefit without any one one who are in nobody who are in nobody in nobody knows in nobody who are freedoing.
The way to mass the freedom is mass like to choice.
The more chooses people are free, and more free is their freedom is their freedom is their benefit is their benefit to be more free.
This is, I think it's so deeply in the society that nobody would have to be a two-sudden.
And it's also deep in our lives.
I'm going to show you some examples of what the progress has repossible.
This is my supermarket. It's not particularly great.
I lost a simple note on the conditional conditions.
In my supermarket is 175 conditions, without contained 10 variety of the extrtracets, and 12 acets. And the 12 12 acets. You can buy a number of degrees in the increases of the most constantly constent in the sciency of your gradidiment.
That's what the supermarket.
And then you go to the snice of electronice: casses, casses, casses, bleft, radio, radio, radio, radio plast, radio plast, radio plast, radio plast, radio plast, the CD, radio wood.
And in this single nice negod, there's a big number of components.

You have to put that is a lot of choice.
Some of the world of communications.

My favorite is what in a meeting, "HP3, cut, and forms of the nose of the nose of the drug for the cruly.

And what happened is the end of the people in the negogoal and does this question and it knows what is the answer? The answer is "No."
It's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn't do too much things.
So, in other aspects of life that are much more important than the water, is the same explosion of choices.
Assistence doesn't happen in the United States that you go from the United States that you go from the doctor and the doctor is what you do.
I said, "You know, you know, you know, you know, you could do it, "You know, do you know, "B" "B" said, "B" has these benefits and these risking." What do you want to do that?"
Those said, "Dr. r. what would I have to do that?"
And the doctor said, "You have these benefits and Brits and Bs these riss, and these risk."
"What do you want to do that?"
And you rebate "Dr. if she was me, what do I do to do that?"
And the doce: "But I'm not lei."
The result of the malato," expression that makes it a beautiful thing.
But in fact, it's not that one slower and the responsibility of understanding of someone who knows what knows knows is the doctor is the doctor, and almost certainly in the same ideal is maled in the same ideal conditional for decisions to take the patient.
There's a huge marketing markets, direct products of products like me and you, you know, if you think about it, and you don't have any sense.
But if we can't buy it, because you don't have to buy them, why do they do that?
The answer is that they want to doing, we call the doctor to ask the rich of changing the rich of change.
And what is that fundamental is our identity is a choice, as you see in this journey of the way you see the children. We don't want to be a little bit of the right right now.
And we can reinvent, you can reinvent,
The means that every morning, you have to do you want to decide that kind of person wants to be about.
And I think about the family and matries a time time time the properspective of the most previous despite was that there was a lot of the most previous warming the most previous prevalent the most previous prevalue as possible.
The only real choice was with check with check -- and not even what do you do to do I do.
On day, it's really really to play it.
Insegone to students very smart and their 20percent in less than a time.
And because they don't do it it doesn't do because they are not doughs.
But why are I implant to ask you to ask you to say, "Do I should I be going to do this right right now.
"Do I have to smilk me me before I do you do before you do it at the care?"
I'm interrogatic gives you.
And they try to answer these questions, even if this implant doesn't really really need to be the company that you are the bel of your exame.
And they have to really do that. I'm very important to that.
Now, the job: We are lucky, like Carl of the East ast technology allows us to work every single single day in the planet -- in the Hotel Randph.
And in the worth of the gangle, and I'm not going to tell anybody where the WiFi WiFoes works work.
I don't want to use it.
What does it meaning, this incredible freedom that we have about the working working on the job? Is it all we need to work in every moment, if we need to work or not.
We can go to see our son to play a cell with the cell cell in a pockets, and the notebook, and the notebook, and the nice nights.
And even if I am all of the switches that we see our son stand the word, we are also asking to this called "Well I said, "Do you know, what is called "Well I said, "Do you know, what is called "Well I said, "What would you have to say, "What is also asking the worth?"
"I have to answer this email? I had to say, I would be a liter?"
And even when the answer is "no," all this makes the whole whole whole of your kid a very different conditions.
So, from any part of it, little bit of the big materials and stilks of life, life is a choices of life, is a choice.
One time the world was this: Ovo, there were some possibilities, but it wasn't a choices.
The world of today is this is this: The dilemma is what is the positive thing is, "Is it a positive thing --
The answer is the reason is there.
The position of the positive of the negative of the negative negative of the negative of the negative things that are going to talk about the negative of the negative of the negative things that are the negative of the negative of the negative of the negative things that are the negative of the negative things that are all of the negative of the negative of
All this choice is two effects of two effects of the gain.
The present is, worth is that produces rather than fresh free.
With many options of the options of which is very difficult to do it.
I have a meaning example of a study of a study of pensionation of pensionation depensionation of pensionation of depensioning it.
A connected to the data has been access to the data of Vanantespecially with about a million clients of clients, with about a million clients of clients.
What she found is that for every 10 solutions that are offering, the percentage of adedesion of adedesion of the 28.
With 50 percent of offers, there's 10-percent of adesions when they are available to be in 5. Because they are available to 5. Why do that?
Because with 50 founded than 50 of the foundly to be very difficult to decidedetains.
And I wonder questions, and I think, of course, questions, and of course, the questions, and of course, the questions don't get it.
And that doesn't only mean that these work from the old of old mandent because they don't have enough money to say that the decision is so slows is so obstates that even the most complex of the complementary of the dator of the work of the dator of work.
I don't talk about 5,000-dollar to 5,000-dollar dator of work -- which would be ben disappears.
So the worth is a consequence of having too much choices.
And I think it looks like this.
"And for finally, for the eternity; "Well or maines or main?
You would have to take the right decision of the right decision of the right heternity, right?
You don't want to be the wrong to the wrong the wrong conditions.
So this is the first effect is that even if we can avoid to avoid the worth of the end of the end of the end of the remarkable we were at least with the options of which are checks with less than the options of which you have been with less than the options of the way we can avoid the worth of what we can be avail.
And this for different reasons.
One of these is that with many conditions of conditions, which is not perfect, and it's not perfect, it's easy to imagine that you could do a different choice that would be better choice that alternative to the alternative of the alternative choices and the reduce of the choice, and the reduce of the choice, and the required by the demine of the surprising of the survival is that you can have to do a different choice from the deffair.
even when it was a good decision.
The more choice is that more is easy to be a good detail of any detail is insoddisfacing of option.
And as it is what economist is what economist is the cost of opportunity.
Dan Gilbert has a very well stamt as the values that we go to the things that we go to the things that we know what we know we know we know it.
And then, when there are many options of options as possible, is easy to be a fairly represents of the alternative alternative of the option that is choice.
Here's a example. I have a whole thing that are not New York.
But it's probably what you probably think about it.
There's this copy from Hamptons.
A place of the luse.
Spidy. It's all for them.
I don't get anything. But what he thinking, "Well, maled."
"All my neighbors in Manhatt."
"I could talk about your case."
And then spent two weeks from the idea that is lost -- every day -- every day -- every day -- the possibility where you want to want to be a lot of worthen.
The expensive opportunity to the soddisfation for that we have, even when the choice is been very excited when the choice was very excited.
And more are the options that we have to be more than we have to be the most of the attentents,
Here's another example.
This journey tells us a lot of things.
We talk about the moment, and perhaps of live in the moment,
But the most important point is that anything you can choice, you have to do not make the other.
And the things that don't have a lot of attractive active activity that can make less attactive what we do.
Third points it growing of the expectation of expectation.
I tried to my pall of the bought a new couple of jeans.
And so I got to almost jeans.
One time the jeans were of a lot of time, they bought them and vests were sweeping them a lot of time, after they were slowed a lot of times, they were going to go good, and they were going to go good.
So, I went to buy a new when the old old of when the old old were go, and said, "I'm a couple of jeans, this is my cut."
The common said, "Li wants to do it slim fit, fit, relaxed fit, relay?"
You want to the cernic with the bottonies? "Stone," or "Stone," "Do you know, "that?
"Do you want to be the stream?"
""Well it wants or the bladoing." And I love the blake --
I was a little bit after a little bit of a little bit of -- I want to say, "I want to the only one guy who was the only one of what I was going to do in the Bmals of my hans, then I got out of the negoties, and then the next couple of jeans that ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever had been hononing.
And it was the mous.
But I feel worst about it.
Why? I wrote a book for understanding it.
The reason I was worst worst is that with all the choice of the whole choice were the treatment of my waiting were very perfect.
And I was expected to be a minim. I didn't expect to be a lot of exceptions, when you live a lot of different places, in the least least one was a perfect of a very perfect had to be perfect.
What I had watched was good at was good at the good --
After I was worded to what I was trying to do with what I was trying to do in confront,
The way of options in the life of the people don't make the waiting to the treatment of the options of the options of the options are in the options of the options are in the options of the options of the options of the options of options in the options of options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options.
And this is going to be less sodynamed when the results are good for them.
No one in the world of marketing if you make it content.
Because if you know what I'm going to talk about it.
The real real real real real as a more than this.
"It was better when it was worst the worst of the time was better when it was worst as it was worst as it was still possible to met of the preprise --
On the world that we live -- opulationalized the industrialized industrialized citizens with the lost of performation -- the massive things are at the treatment of the expectations are the treatment of the expectation of the expectations of the expectacactivity.
You never have to be surprise to evolutionary because your waite, my waite, you know, my waite, you know, my waite.
The secret of happiness -- what you're here is -- "Basas," "Yeah, you want to be it."
I mean a little time -- which are really smart -- which are really smixed and it's really stupendy.
I don't have to do a meeting, I don't have to make me.
But it doesn't always make it is a good thing.
And finally, a consequence of buy a couple of jeans scomoes when you are just the kind of jeans is that when you're not sodymed you say, "Why do you don't do why do you do why you don't you why you do that?"
"Who is responsible responsiously, the answer is clear.
The world is the responsible responsible. What would I do about that?
When there are hundreds of kinds of jeans, and buy a insudden, and you ask you you who is the responsible to the responsible is the very clear.
You could do better.
With hundreds of variety of variety and we don't have a successful.
So when people are the decisions, even if the result is valive, you feel incomfortable and date the same as they are the colate of their own own itself.
In the last years the depression is explosion in the industrialized industrialized the industrialized.
I think a meaning -- not the universe -- not the universe -- of this ondie is just that people have experiences because the standards are too alone.
And when they need to explain this situation is they think that colpes are them.
So the final result is that in general general generally, but we feel about it, and we feel worse.
Let me remember you remember you.
This is the official official official official and is completely fail.
There's no double that a little choice that is better than you don't have to be better than that is not going to be a little choice that is better than a pocke.
There's a critical value critical value.
But I'm sure we have superby a piece of a piece of the level that choices our life.
Now, from the political point -- I have almost finally fined -- from the policy is the following is the following is the follow.
What allows this whole choice in the society is the rich material
There are many places in the world, and you know what the problem is not that the problem is that they don't have too much choice.
The problem is that they too much.
So the thing that I'm talking about is a mality of modern modern is a mality of modern modern society that society society.
And what it makes you and array is this: Steve Levitt you talk about how those constent expensive is the same as the consticks and scomods are inuseful, it's a lot of money.
I mean these choices, complicated and dispended depending and it is not just inuseful.
I'm really really deleteries.
We make worst worse.
If a little bit of what in our society has to choice was reversed in those where people have too much much more than they have too much more to better but also the nounced the nouncing nounced with the nounced in the same way.
This is what economists call a better better better than the implant improvement.
One redistributed the redition is good for all -- not just the poor -- because of this choice in a very except that it is.
And to conclude is, you can be all that you can be all that you want to be --
Voooes, people of culture, think what makes that fish?"
"It's obvious that you can't make anything in a vetrow of the vet."
"One imagination is a fairly of the world."
and I interpretated this thing in the begin.
But then, I think of it, I realized that that fishes the fish.
Because the reality of the fact is that if you hold the boccurs the black hand, in a way that "all of the freedom is not the freedoes.
If you go into the bock in a way that all become possible to dimine the soddisappearation.
You get the worths of the worthy and reduce the benefit is.
Everybody need a sfer.
This is almost too much too much too much too much too much for the fish, and physics for us.
But the exploites of some symbolic symbolic recipes for the infelicity --
Thank you very much.
