<unk> years ago, here at TED, <unk> <unk> <unk> a challenge of <unk> called the <unk> challenge.
And the idea is very simple.
<unk> of four people have to build the <unk> <unk> possible that <unk> up alone, <unk> 20 <unk>, a <unk> <unk>, a <unk> of <unk> <unk>, a <unk> of <unk> and a <unk>.
The <unk> has to be <unk> at the top of the <unk>.
And, even though it looks very simple, in fact, it's pretty difficult, because people <unk> very quickly.
So I thought it was an interesting idea, and I <unk> it into a <unk> lab.
And it was a huge success.
And since then, I <unk> about 70 <unk> <unk> of <unk> of this kind around the world with students, designers and <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> of research and <unk> companies of 50.
There's something in this <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> on the nature of <unk>, and I'd like to share with some of these <unk> with you.
<unk>, most people start with the <unk> to the task.
They're talking about it, they're going to <unk> for the power, and then <unk> time, <unk>.
<unk> of <unk> and <unk> the <unk>.
<unk> most of the time at the <unk> <unk> in <unk> structures and, at the end, right, when the time is to <unk>, somebody <unk> out the <unk>, and they <unk> it on top, they do a step back and <unk> it at the top, they do a step back and <unk>.
<unk> the job.
But what happens, actually, most of the time, is that the "<unk>" is <unk> in a <unk>, because the weight of the <unk> is <unk> and <unk> the whole structure.
There's a number of people who have a lot more <unk> moments of others, and between the <unk> are <unk> business <unk>.
<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and they create absolutely <unk>.
And there are <unk> groups that have much more <unk> structures, and, among the best, there are <unk> schools.
And it's amazing.
As <unk> says, not only create the <unk> structures, but they're also the most interesting structures.
And your question is, how is it possible? Why do you? What they have about?
And I would like to say, "<unk> of the <unk> <unk>."
Don't spend time <unk> for the power.
But there is another reason.
And the reason is that the students of economics are <unk> to find the best project.
And then <unk>.
And after, what happens is that when you <unk> the <unk> at the top, they have no time, and what happens?
<unk>.
<unk> <unk>? Right.
What the children do is <unk>, is that they <unk> by <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, one after the other, <unk>, <unk> at the top of the <unk>, so many possibilities of <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> designers that this kind of <unk> is the <unk> of <unk> process.
And with every version, the kids have a <unk> <unk> about what works and what it works.
So the ability to work on <unk> is <unk>, but we see different groups.
The media for most of the people is about 50 <unk>, for the students of economics, about half, <unk>, a little bit better, but not very, children better than adults.
Who makes all better than everybody?
<unk> and engineers, <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> is the <unk> structure I've ever seen.
And why? Because I <unk> that <unk> and <unk> <unk> models are the key to build <unk> structures.
Then we have the <unk> <unk>, a little better than the average.
But here's where it becomes interesting.
If you <unk> a <unk> <unk>, the group can do much better.
It's amazing. You're going to be <unk>. "<unk> that group." You can understand that group. "You can understand in <unk>. And why?
Because they have <unk> ability to <unk> work.
<unk> the process, <unk>.
And all the groups that <unk> and <unk> attention to work <unk> the result of the team.
<unk> <unk> and <unk> of <unk>, and their <unk> <unk> to a success.
If you've got 10 groups that usually work well, maybe you're going to be <unk> <unk>.
And I <unk> an interesting experiment.
I thought, <unk> the <unk> for once.
I put on the <unk> <unk> dollars in software to <unk> team.
What do you think it's happened to design students?
What was the result?
That's what happened.
No team created a <unk> structure.
If one of them had built a <unk> <unk> <unk>, he would bring home.
It's not interesting that a high impact?
We <unk> again the <unk> with the same students.
What do you think it's happened?
Now they had <unk> value.
The same team, from <unk> has become the best.
They created the <unk> structure in <unk> time.
So, this is a important <unk> about the nature of the <unk> and success.
The reason is this: help to create <unk> and <unk> to help groups build cars, <unk> and <unk>.
And what it does a <unk> challenge is to help <unk> <unk>.
Because, <unk>, every project has his <unk>, isn't it?
The challenge <unk> an <unk> experience, a common language, a common position to build a <unk>.
And so, this is the value of the experience, of this simple <unk>.
And those of you who are interested, can go to <unk>
It's a <unk> where you can take a look at how to build <unk>.
There are <unk> step.
There are <unk> examples from around the world about how people <unk> and <unk> the system.
There's also the world's <unk>.
And the most important lesson, I think, is that design is really a <unk> of contact.
<unk> the <unk> of all the <unk>, and the <unk> of the most <unk> <unk>, the <unk> and the <unk> to <unk> the challenge that you have in your hand.
And sometimes, a little <unk> of this experience is all you need to <unk> a <unk> moment.
And that can really make the difference.
Thank you very much.
<unk> <unk> I have here a <unk>, great, beautiful, in <unk> TED, is a time machine.
Everybody in this room must <unk>.
You can go back, you can go back; you can't go back; you can't see where you are.
And I would <unk> to know what I'm going to talk about, because I asked my friends in the last time, and everybody wants to come back.
I don't know. Let's go back before there were or <unk>, or "<unk> <unk>."
I don't know.
They're <unk> that there is a kind of <unk> to the <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
<unk> it.
But I don't do part of that group, I have to <unk> it.
I don't want to go back, and not why I'm <unk>, it's because the chance on this planet doesn't <unk> back, go on.
So I want to go into the machine, and I want to go on.
This is the best time there was on this planet in every field that we can measure, health, <unk>, <unk>, opportunities, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> of disease.
There's never been a time like this.
My <unk> <unk>, everyone, before the age of 60.
My <unk> <unk> that number to 70.
My parents are for <unk> 80.
So it's better that there's a <unk> at the beginning of my <unk>.
But it's not just people like us, it's a much bigger thing about this.
A child born in New <unk> today can <unk> of living as the <unk> man in the world of 100 years ago.
<unk>. It's an incredible fact.
How do it?
<unk>. <unk> has <unk> billion people on this planet.
It changed the <unk> of <unk> as no war.
If <unk> has gone. <unk>.
We <unk> it. <unk>.
In the <unk> world, diseases that <unk> million people only a generation does no longer exist.
<unk>, <unk>, <unk> --
Does anyone know what are they?
<unk>, modern medicine, our ability to <unk> billion people, these are <unk> of the scientific <unk>.
And to me, the scientific <unk>, to <unk> things, see if they work, is one of the great <unk> of humanity.
These were good news.
<unk>, they were the good news <unk> because there are other problems, and they've been <unk> many times, for example of one of them is that, although all we've <unk>, a billion people go to bed <unk> on this planet, every day.
This number is <unk>, with incredible <unk>, and it's <unk>.
And not only, we used our creativity to <unk> the planet.
<unk> <unk>, land <unk>, <unk> <unk>, oil, natural gas. They're <unk>, and they're <unk> quickly, and if we don't <unk> our <unk> to <unk> out of this <unk>, <unk> we'll also.
So the question is, can we do that? I think that.
I think it's clear that you can produce food for <unk> billion people without <unk> the land that they live on.
I think you can <unk> this world of energy without this <unk>.
I really believe it, and no, it's not a <unk> <unk>.
But here's the thing that <unk> me <unk> at night -- one of the things that <unk> me <unk> me at night.
We've never had that <unk> <unk> <unk> as we have now, never, and we have never been in the position of <unk> to the best of how we could be today.
We are at a incredible step from incredible events, in many <unk>.
But yet, I think we should go <unk>, 300 years, before the <unk>, to find a period where we have <unk> the <unk>, a period where we have <unk> more <unk>, and more <unk>, than we do now.
People <unk> in what they believe, and they do it with <unk> force.
<unk> the truth can <unk>.
<unk>, everybody has <unk> right to your own <unk>; they also have their own <unk> in progress, but you know what's not?
You don't have right to your <unk>. You can't.
I put this in <unk>.
A <unk> years ago I wrote a story about <unk> for "The New <unk>," a short article.
And I was <unk> that somebody <unk>, who was <unk> to what is, after all, the public health measure of all human history.
I didn't know what to do, so I did as <unk>, I wrote the story, and I went to else.
Not much later, I wrote a story about <unk> <unk> food.
<unk>, just bigger.
People were <unk>.
So I wrote a story about that, and I'm not going to understand why people <unk> <unk> as "food," <unk> "," because I thought the molecules in a <unk> way, which is <unk> the molecules in <unk> <unk>.
But, as always, I do my job. I wrote the story, and I went on.
I mean, I'm a <unk>: <unk>, <unk>, let's go back there.
But these stories <unk> me and I couldn't understand why, but I finally did it.
The problem was that those <unk> who were <unk> me wasn't <unk> at all <unk>.
They were people in <unk>, <unk>, people for good.
They were exactly like people in this room.
And the thing really <unk> me --
But then I thought, you know, you've got to be <unk>; we're at a point on this planet, where we have no relationship to progress with progress.
We're talking about this <unk>.
We're talking in terms of <unk> using <unk>: "<unk>." It's OK, there are reasons to do it, and I think we know what they are.
We have lost trust institutions in <unk>, and sometimes in science itself, and sometimes in science itself, and it's <unk> that it's happened.
Let me just do some <unk> and people <unk>.
<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>.
I mean, everybody has his list.
We have questions and problems with people who have always been right.
So <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, <unk> answers, <unk> <unk>.
I didn't know anything about <unk>.
But here's the fundamental point: when the evidence comes to <unk>, and we're not very <unk> in this.
And I think the reason is that there is a <unk> of fear that I've never seen and hope that I've never seen.
12 years ago, he came up with a story, a <unk> story, who thought there was a <unk> between an <unk> of <unk> and <unk> against <unk>, <unk> and <unk>.
Very <unk>.
<unk> studies were <unk> to see if it was true.
And you've got to do hundreds of studies; it's an important issue.
At the end, they <unk> the data.
<unk> from the United States, from <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and everybody was <unk>, no <unk>, no <unk>, no <unk>, no <unk>.
He didn't make a difference. He didn't believe it because we believe what we see -- to what we think we can see, to what we think about seeing.
We don't believe a <unk> of <unk> <unk> of the government <unk> that show us numbers, and I think it all.
But you know what?
<unk> have been <unk> --
It's because that's a fact: the United States is a few countries in the world where the number of <unk> against the <unk> is <unk>.
It's <unk>, and we should <unk> ourselves.
It's terrible.
What happened that has <unk> us to do something like that?
Now, I'm going to <unk> it.
<unk>, anybody here has <unk>?
<unk> in the audience has ever seen a person die of <unk>?
It's not a lot.
In this country doesn't happen, but it's happened in this country last year.
I'm a nice <unk> to <unk>, 20 every time.
But because it didn't happen here, we can <unk> from his head, and people like <unk> <unk> can go around <unk> <unk> of fear and <unk> as a <unk> or <unk> <unk>.
And they can do it because they don't <unk> the difference between <unk> and <unk>.
I don't believe that these two things seem <unk>, but they're not almost ever.
But it's something that we need to learn, and we have to <unk> very quickly.
This man was a <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
It <unk> humanity from one of his <unk> <unk>.
<unk> fear, no <unk> -- <unk> -- <unk>.
The man at the center, not <unk>.
It's called Paul <unk>.
It's just created a <unk> against <unk> with other people.
It <unk> the life of 400, 500 children every year in the developing world.
<unk>, right?
It's <unk>, if it's not that Paul goes around talking about the <unk>, it says how <unk> they are and that people should just <unk> <unk>.
And he says in these terms.
So, Paul is a <unk>.
When Paul talks in a public <unk> can't <unk> without a <unk> <unk>.
They call it at home because of some like <unk> that know where his children her children go to school.
Why? Because Paul created a <unk>.
I wouldn't need <unk>, but <unk> are <unk>.
If you try to <unk>, <unk> disease, <unk> disease, and is going on.
We have again the <unk> in this country.
And it's going to be worse, and it's not a lot of children who are going to die again because it's just a question of numbers.
And it's not just <unk>.
<unk>? <unk> that. Why not?
A <unk> of my <unk> <unk> wrote a couple of weeks ago, and he told me that <unk> me a little <unk>.
<unk> told me before.
She wouldn't have her son against the <unk>.
<unk> <unk>.
OK.
Why? Because there is no <unk>. But you know what?
We had no <unk> in the United States.
I don't know today -- I don't know, you know, you know, you know, you know, now it's <unk>.
<unk> <unk> in a couple of hours, <unk> a machine, <unk> here to <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> to one of these <unk> <unk> <unk> from TED.
He doesn't know it's been <unk> by a <unk> disease, and we don't even know, because that's how the world works.
This is the planet in which we live. We don't do that.
We <unk> <unk> <unk>. We need to do that.
<unk> <unk>?
<unk>, a little <unk> to start the day.
I know you've done it because the half of the Americans do this every day.
<unk> that stuff, as you <unk> to <unk> medicine, and it doesn't matter how often they're <unk>.
<unk> always <unk> it.
<unk> the <unk> <unk>. <unk> than that they do, almost never.
But it's OK, you want to <unk> <unk> billion dollars for <unk> <unk>, are with you.
<unk> <unk>. <unk>.
Why do we do that? Why?
I think of understand, <unk> the great <unk> <unk>.
<unk> the big machine. It doesn't <unk> us.
And we do well. Our <unk> system does <unk>.
It's <unk> to millions of people.
It's absolutely, incredibly cold and <unk> for those of us who can <unk>.
So let me go away, and from who <unk> us?
<unk> of the great <unk> <unk>.
It's great. We <unk> the great <unk>.
You know, it's a serious problem because this stuff is a <unk>, and you <unk> billion dollars.
I have a whole series of examples here.
<unk> of these -- <unk> -- a <unk>, <unk> -- a <unk>, <unk> -- I don't know what it's but it's going to take billions of dollars, and it's a <unk>.
You know what? When I say these things, people <unk> me against, and they say, "But what are you interested in <unk> that people want.
It's good. "
<unk> a little? You have <unk>.
Because I don't care if it's the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> to say, "<unk>, I don't <unk> to hear the evidence of the <unk> on the <unk>," or if it says some <unk> of cancer.
When you <unk> the road <unk> to <unk> science and evidence with <unk> and <unk>, <unk> in a place where you don't want to be.
<unk> like <unk> <unk> in South Africa.
It has <unk> 400 <unk> of his <unk> <unk> to say that <unk>, <unk> and <unk> of <unk> <unk> that we can <unk> the <unk> of AIDS.
<unk> of thousands of <unk> <unk> in a country that has been <unk> more than any other disease.
Please don't <unk> that there are no <unk> for these <unk>.
There are. There's always.
Now, the most <unk> <unk> that we're in the middle right now is the <unk> war between the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> of <unk> food.
It's a <unk> <unk>.
It's a <unk> about words, on <unk>.
It's <unk>, it's not science.
Every single thing that <unk>, every <unk> of <unk>, every <unk> of <unk>, every <unk> of <unk> has been <unk> by man.
You see, there was no <unk> in the <unk> of <unk>.
There were no <unk>.
There were no <unk> trees. We had them <unk>.
We've done that over the last <unk> years.
<unk> <unk> and something else doesn't.
And we <unk> what we didn't know.
We can do it more <unk>.
And there are <unk>, of course, there are.
But we can <unk> things like <unk>. A in <unk>, and that <unk> million people, <unk> their life.
And we don't want to do that?
I have to tell you, I don't know.
We're <unk> to <unk>.
Why?
The things that I hear is: <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
We don't want the <unk> companies on life.
We don't want the companies to be <unk> <unk>.
<unk> is my answer to this?
It's yes. You're right. You're right.
It's true, we have a huge food problem, but it's not science.
It's got nothing to do with science.
It's law, <unk>, <unk> lines on the <unk>.
You know, the science is not a <unk>.
It's not a country.
It's not an idea; it's a process.
It's a process, sometimes gives a <unk> <unk> to times not, but the idea that we shouldn't <unk> science to do his work just because we have fear is actually very <unk>, very <unk>, and it's <unk> to millions of people in <unk>.
You know, in the next 50 years we could produce 70 percent of food in more than what we <unk> now, 70 percent.
These are the <unk> in Africa of the last 30 years.
<unk>. <unk>.
They need to do that and we don't <unk> it.
Why? <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We don't want to <unk> people to eat <unk> like <unk>.
<unk> billion people <unk>.
<unk> a little bit of a <unk>.
But it just <unk>. <unk> <unk>.
It didn't have <unk> <unk>, but scientists are <unk> the way to <unk> right now.
So many people could eat and <unk> less the risk of getting <unk>.
<unk>'t <unk>, and you know what?
It would be good. It wouldn't be a <unk> <unk>, but it would be very good.
<unk> <unk> just: Why are we against?
I mean, <unk>: why are we <unk> this?
Just why don't we want to <unk> the genes over there?
It's about <unk> genes. It's not <unk> <unk>.
It's not our <unk> <unk> for <unk>, or our <unk> to be bigger food, better, better, <unk>.
There's no <unk> <unk>.
It's about <unk> people's life, and it would be now like to understand what it means.
Why -- you want to <unk>? -- if you don't <unk> it, and you start to <unk> how we're going to do something that I don't think <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
There is no other way to <unk> what's going on.
It's <unk>, it's <unk>. It's in front of us, and we have to <unk> it.
So, after this <unk> talk, you could still go into this <unk> machine of time and go to the future?
Of course, I want.
It's based on now, but we have an incredible opportunity.
We can <unk> the machine of time as we want.
We have a chance to <unk> where we want, and we're going to do it where we really want.
We have to do these <unk>, and we have to think about it, but when we go into the car of the time, and we're going to <unk> it.
I know that we can and, as far as I think, that the world needs to immediately.
Thank you.
Thank you.
One day, the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> Times <unk> <unk> was <unk> on the streets of the center of <unk> <unk> when he <unk> a beautiful music.
<unk> <unk> by a man, a fascinating man, fascinating man, with the <unk> <unk>, who had a <unk> who had just two <unk>.
I'm <unk> a story that many of you <unk>, because the <unk> of <unk> <unk> for a book, who, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, came to the great screen, with <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> the part of <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> in the part of the <unk> <unk> <unk>, the <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> was <unk>.
<unk> <unk> the <unk>, he <unk> a terrible <unk> <unk>, and 30 years later, <unk> as a <unk> to the streets of <unk> <unk> in the center of <unk> <unk>.
I <unk> all of you to read the book of <unk>, or look at the film to understand not just the <unk> <unk> that <unk> between these two men,
My name is <unk> <unk>. I'm an <unk> of <unk>.
<unk> online for 10 years, and my <unk> for the next 10 years is to try to make it easy to save the world in real life as it is in the world games.
To do that I have a plan, and I'm going to go to the more <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> three billion hours a week <unk> online.
Some of you may think, "<unk> a little bit of time to play."
perhaps too long, <unk> how many <unk> we have to solve in the real world.
In fact, in my research, I <unk> the <unk> for <unk>, is actually true.
<unk> billion hours a week is not <unk> <unk> to solve the <unk> problems in the world.
In fact, I think if we want to survive the next century on this planet, we have to <unk> that <unk>.
I <unk> that the total of which we need is about <unk> billion hours of play every week.
It's probably an idea an <unk> <unk>, so the <unk>, to <unk> the concept.
If we want to solve problems which <unk>, poverty, the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>, I think we have to have the <unk> to play online, for at least <unk> billion hours to the <unk>, for the end of the next <unk>. No, they are <unk>, they really.
That's why. This <unk> image because I think it's so important for the <unk> of the human species. <unk>.
This is a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk>, wanted to <unk> the game.
So he's got <unk> as <unk>.
And this is a <unk> <unk> of play.
If you're not <unk> <unk>, you can't <unk> some of the <unk> of this picture.
You can probably notice the sense of <unk>, some fear, but also a <unk> <unk>, a very <unk> attention, a very <unk> attention to a very difficult problem.
If you're <unk> <unk>, you <unk> some <unk>, the <unk> around the eyes, and around the mouth are a <unk> of <unk>.
And the <unk> <unk> <unk> show.
This is a <unk> <unk> to a step from something called a <unk> <unk>.
<unk>, it's a term that you've already heard. OK.
So we have <unk> <unk> between us.
A <unk> <unk> is such a <unk> <unk> that doesn't seem like you can't do it.
It's almost beyond the <unk> of the imagination, and when we <unk> is a <unk> to find what you're really capable. This is a <unk> <unk>.
This <unk> is at a <unk> <unk>.
And this is the <unk> that we need to see on the <unk> of millions of <unk> of problems in the world as we <unk> the next hundred years. The <unk> of somebody who, against all <unk>, is at a step from a <unk> <unk>.
So, this is the <unk> that we see in the life of every day while we're going to deal with <unk> problems.
This is the <unk> I call it. "I'm not <unk> <unk>." And I'm in <unk>. "You see that? Yes. Okay.
I am with the <unk>. "I'm not <unk> <unk>."
This is a <unk> in my old neighborhood in <unk>, California, where I did the <unk> on because we're more <unk> in real life.
And this is a lot of many <unk> <unk>: <unk> that we're not <unk> as well as in games.
And I don't mean "<unk>" just as "<unk>," even though the success is part of it: <unk> more results in online <unk>.
But I also mean, "<unk> in the sense of <unk> to do something important, <unk> to <unk> and <unk>.
And when we're in a online world, I believe that many of us become the best <unk> of ourselves, the most capable of help with no <unk>, more capable of <unk> on a problem for all time, to <unk> after a <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
And in real life, when you <unk> a <unk>, when you <unk> a <unk>, often, we don't have that <unk> us, maybe <unk>, <unk> or <unk>.
I would never <unk> these <unk> as they <unk>, they just don't have in a game.
So this is what I wanted to study university.
What is that in a game <unk> us to feel that we can't get any result?
How can we <unk> those <unk> from games and <unk> to the real world?
So, I studied <unk> games like <unk> of <unk>, which is really the <unk> environment to solve problems.
And I started to notice some things that make <unk> <unk> <unk> so possible in <unk> <unk>.
The first is that, when I <unk> in one of these online games, especially in the <unk> of <unk>, there are <unk> characters <unk> of a mission to save the world.
But it's not a mission any perfectly <unk> <unk> to your current level in your game. Right?
So you can <unk> it.
They never give you an impossible challenge.
But it's at your <unk>. So you have to <unk> <unk>.
But there is no <unk> in <unk> of <unk>, you don't have the time to <unk> the <unk>, there's always something <unk> and important to do.
And there are also <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, hundreds of thousands of people, <unk> to <unk> your <unk> mission.
It's not such a common thing in real life, this feeling that we have <unk> <unk>.
And there's also this <unk> <unk>, this <unk> that <unk>, on why we're there, and what we're doing.
And then I <unk> this <unk> --
You've heard about <unk> <unk> and <unk> one in intelligence.
Don't make that kind of <unk> <unk> in real life.
When you <unk> this stage, you don't have to talk in front of an audience, and <unk> <unk> in <unk> ideas.
Don't make that kind of <unk> in real life.
Now, the problem of <unk> online as the <unk> of <unk> is that gives so <unk> to be at one step from a <unk> <unk> all of our time, which is going to <unk> all of our time in these play.
<unk> is better than reality.
That's why, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> all the <unk> of <unk> have spent <unk> million years to solve the <unk> problems.
This is not a <unk> thing.
But <unk> in perspective: <unk> million years ago was the time when one of our <unk> <unk> up.
That was the first <unk> to walk <unk>.
Okay, so when we're talking about how long we're going to play, the only <unk> <unk>, is to talk about <unk> times <unk> to the human evolution, which is an extraordinary thing, but also, because we discovered that we've discovered that <unk> all this time to play, we're <unk> what we're going to be human, we're starting to <unk> more heart.
This is true, I believe.
So let's <unk> this interesting <unk>.
It was <unk> <unk> by a <unk> at <unk> University.
The young <unk> <unk> today in a country with a strong country of <unk> <unk>, will have spent <unk> hours <unk> online, at the age of <unk>.
<unk> hours is a very interesting number for two reasons.
First of all, for the children in the United States in the <unk> hours is the <unk> number of hours of <unk> to <unk> if you're present all day.
So we've got a whole <unk> of education <unk> in which young <unk> as being <unk> <unk> <unk> at school at the time in which we <unk> everything else.
And some of you have probably read the new book in <unk> <unk>, "<unk>."
If you've done it, you've read about this theory of success, <unk> theory for success.
It's based on a <unk> research in the field of <unk>, which <unk> that if you <unk> hours of <unk> <unk> to any thing at the age of <unk> <unk> in that field.
<unk> <unk> in that something as much as people in the world.
So, what we have now is a whole generation of young people's <unk> genes.
So, the question is, "<unk>, what do these <unk>?"
because if we wanted to figure out what it's going to be a amount of human resources without <unk>.
This is the number of people in the world that <unk> at least an hour a day to play online.
These are our <unk> of the game.
500 million people who are <unk> <unk> -- in something.
And in the next <unk> we will have another billion <unk> <unk> that are <unk> <unk> in that something.
If you don't understand that, that's what's going to tell us: the <unk> industry is <unk> <unk> that <unk> energy and work with the cell phone, instead of the Internet to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> all over the world, in particular, in India, China, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> online.
<unk> is a billion <unk> in the next <unk>.
This <unk> us to <unk> billion <unk>.
So I started thinking about what these games are <unk> us in genes.
These are four <unk> that I <unk>. The first is a <unk> <unk>.
Okay. <unk> like a <unk> form of <unk>.
A <unk> <unk> is the <unk> of <unk> immediately to deal with a <unk>, with the <unk> of success.
The <unk> <unk> always believe that a <unk> <unk> is possible, and that <unk> all the time.
<unk> <unk> are not with your hands.
<unk> <unk> are <unk> in <unk> a social <unk>.
There's a lot of interesting research shows that we better with other people after having <unk> with them, even though they have <unk> <unk>.
And the reason is that it takes a lot of trust to play with someone. We have trust <unk> their time with us, who are <unk> with the same rules and <unk>, and that <unk> to the play of the game.
So, playing with the <unk> of <unk> and <unk>.
It turns out that we have more <unk> social relationships.
<unk> <unk>. <unk>.
You know, there's a reason that the <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> hours a week, almost <unk> work.
It's because we know, as we're <unk>, that we're actually <unk> to <unk>, rather than <unk> or <unk> time.
We know that we're human being, to work <unk> to something that has meaning.
And the <unk> <unk> are used to work <unk> <unk>, if you're <unk> a <unk> task.
<unk>, <unk> meaning.
The <unk> <unk> to be <unk> <unk>, to human stories on <unk> scale.
For example, a small information small information to create a context.
They all <unk>, the biggest <unk> in the world.
The second <unk> <unk> in the world, with almost <unk> <unk> is the <unk> of <unk> million people do it every month.
They have <unk> more information on <unk> of <unk> in the Internet, which on any other <unk> in the world.
We were building a <unk> <unk>.
We were building a <unk> <unk> information <unk> <unk> of <unk>.
Okay, these are four <unk> that together one thing.
<unk> <unk> are individuals of great <unk> <unk> of <unk>.
These are people who believe in being able to change the world.
The only problem is that they believe that they are capable of changing <unk>, but not that real.
This is the problem I'm trying to solve.
There's a <unk> called <unk> <unk>.
<unk> studies are <unk>. It's <unk> why people <unk> so much time, energy and money, in <unk> online.
He said, "We're <unk> what we're going to do less than a mass <unk> towards the <unk> <unk> and <unk> online."
And it's a <unk>, so it's <unk>, and it's -- not like me, I'm a <unk> <unk> --
But he <unk> -- he <unk> that this is a perfectly <unk> thing, because the <unk> <unk> can get more in the online online <unk> than in real life.
You have to have more <unk> social <unk> in a game that isn't in real life.
<unk> a better <unk> and you get more <unk> <unk> in a game that isn't in real life.
So, <unk>, for now, it's perfectly <unk> for <unk> <unk>, spend more time in the <unk> <unk> that in the real world. I agree that this is <unk>, for now, but it's not, in the way, a <unk> situation, a <unk> situation. We have to start making the real game.
This is <unk> from something that <unk> <unk> years ago.
These are <unk> <unk>, made of <unk> <unk> <unk>. <unk> we had <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. And these <unk>, the first <unk> tools.
If you look at the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk>, perhaps <unk> already.
It's the story of who <unk> games and why.
<unk> <unk> that games, in particular, the <unk> games, were <unk> in the <unk> of <unk>, during a period of <unk>.
I thought the <unk> was so <unk>, that the <unk> of <unk> <unk> to do something <unk>.
People <unk>, the population was in <unk>, it was a <unk> situation, they needed a <unk> solution.
So, <unk>, <unk> the games of <unk> and <unk> a <unk> law for all the <unk>.
One day, everybody would <unk>.
The next day, everybody would <unk>.
And it's <unk> so <unk> in <unk> games, since you play is so <unk>, and we <unk> it in a state of <unk> <unk>, which <unk> the fact that you have nothing to eat.
And so one day <unk>, and a <unk> day.
And <unk> <unk>, <unk>, 18 years, <unk> to the <unk> <unk> one day and <unk> that <unk>.
I think that's exactly the way we use games today.
<unk> the games for <unk> to the <unk> of the real world.
<unk> the games for <unk> from everything that we don't work in our real environment, by everything that we don't think about real life, and <unk> what we need.
But we don't have to be <unk> here.
This is interesting <unk>: <unk> <unk>, after 18 years, the <unk> didn't <unk> <unk>, so the <unk> <unk> that would <unk> one last <unk> to <unk>.
<unk> the entire <unk> <unk>, <unk> a <unk> <unk>, and the <unk> of that <unk> <unk> to a <unk> <unk>.
<unk> the <unk> and <unk> to try to find a new land where to live, <unk> behind the right number of people to survive with the resources, with the <unk> of people to survive with the resources, with the hope of it, where it could <unk>.
It's a little <unk>, right?
But <unk>, <unk> studies have <unk> that <unk> that they were going to take the <unk> <unk>, <unk> the same DNA of <unk> <unk>.
So, you know, scientists have <unk> that the story from <unk> is a real story.
And <unk> have found <unk> of a global <unk> that <unk> almost 20 years, and that could explain the <unk>.
So this amazing story could be true: they could actually have <unk> their <unk> culture, <unk> in the games for 18 years, and then being so <unk>, and know so good as <unk> in the game to save the whole civilization.
Okay, we can do it.
We started <unk> from <unk>.
It was the first game in real time of the <unk> series of <unk>. This was 16 years ago.
They started <unk> for 18 years, we have <unk> <unk> for 16 years.
I say, we're <unk> for our <unk> game.
They <unk> half the population on a trip to find a new world.
It's from here that <unk> the idea of <unk> billion hours of play a week.
It turns out that half of us <unk> to move an hour a day to play, until we <unk> the world's problems.
What you're going to ask, "How do we do to solve the world's problems in a game?" Well, this is what I <unk> my work in the <unk> years, <unk> <unk> for <unk>.
In our <unk> <unk> <unk>, we have this <unk> that <unk> our idea of how we should help us with the future.
We don't want to <unk> the future.
What we want to do is to <unk> the future.
You can imagine the <unk> from the best, and then we want to give the opportunity to people to <unk> reality.
You can imagine <unk> <unk> <unk> and then giving people the tools to <unk>.
I'm going to show you three games that I did, and that I'm a <unk> to give people the tools to create <unk> in their future.
This is "<unk> <unk> <unk>."
We did this game in <unk>.
It's an online online online for you to survive a <unk> of oil.
The <unk> is not real, but we have <unk> <unk> material to make it be, and to make life life life real as if you can <unk> it. So, when you go into the game, you know, you're going to take a <unk> in real time, you get there in real time, data that's <unk>, things that are not available, the things that are not available on the distribution of food,
the impact on the <unk>, if the schools are <unk>, if there are <unk>, and you have to think about how you <unk> your life if all that is real. You've got to have a <unk> on, about <unk> <unk>, of <unk> photos --
We <unk> this game with <unk> <unk> in <unk>, and we <unk> them since then for the three years <unk>, and what I can tell you is that it's an experience.
<unk> wants to change the way they live only because it's a good thing for the world or because it's a good thing for the world.
But if you put them in a <unk> <unk> and <unk>, "We don't have oil.
This is an amazing story. It's an amazing story. It's a <unk>.
<unk> yourself as a <unk>. "
Most of our <unk> has then <unk> the <unk> that has learned in the game.
So, for the next game <unk> <unk> the world, we decided to <unk> <unk>, to a bigger problem of oil <unk>.
We did a game called <unk>, at the <unk> for the <unk>, and the <unk> was, a <unk> <unk> that humanity has only other <unk> years on this planet.
The <unk> is called "<unk> of <unk> <unk>." <unk>. "
We asked people of <unk> online <unk> almost like a <unk> <unk> film.
They <unk> them the movie of <unk> <unk>, <unk> a dream team: there is the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>, and they all have something to do to save the world, but in our game, instead of having only five people in the dream team, all of the team, are <unk> part of the team. And that is the future of the energy, the <unk> of the future, the <unk> of the future.
<unk> people have <unk> for eight weeks, they <unk> 500 <unk> solutions that you can find if you go online and <unk> on Google "<unk>."
And finally, the last game, <unk> <unk>. This is a game that's a <unk> game with the <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
If you look at the <unk> game is <unk> by the <unk> of <unk> <unk>, like <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
<unk> with <unk> <unk> for <unk> Africa, we're <unk> them to learn about social innovation.
There's a story of <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>
<unk> <unk> all of you to share this game with young people, anywhere in the world, in particular areas in the developing world, which may be <unk> by <unk> to begin to imagine in their social <unk> to save the world.
It's time to <unk>.
I want to ask a question.
What do you think that <unk>?
We have all these incredible <unk>, we have these games that are <unk> projects of what we might do, but no one of these has still <unk> the real world.
Well, I hope you can agree with me that the <unk> <unk> are a human <unk> that we can use to do for work in the real world, that the games are a powerful <unk> for change, that we have these incredible <unk>, a social <unk>, this <unk> <unk>, the ability of <unk> a social <unk>, this <unk> <unk>, and the <unk> of a <unk> meaning.
I really hope that we can <unk> <unk> to play on the games that are <unk>, to survive on this planet for another century, and my hope is that I'm going to give you to me in making and games like this.
When we go on to the next <unk>, two things are <unk>: that we can make any future of <unk>, and that we can play any game we want.
So, I say, let's start the games that <unk> the world.
Thank you.
For some time, I'm interested in the <unk> effect, it can look like a <unk> thing that a <unk> <unk>, unless I <unk> it from my point of view, which is, "something <unk> is real." In other words, the <unk> of <unk> have a <unk> effect in some <unk>. "In other words, the <unk> of <unk>, because the person thinks
which is <unk> to a <unk> or something like this --
The <unk> of pain, for example, if they believe they have a <unk> effect in the body called <unk>.
<unk> of <unk> becomes something true for the <unk> that if it has.
I want to show you a <unk> <unk> <unk>, very simple.
And I'm going to show you how it works. This is a <unk> that's in all the books for children years from the <unk> years.
I learned it only <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk>.
I'm going to <unk> it for you.
And so I'll tell you why I <unk> it.
That's what happens.
The <unk>, you can <unk>; my hand, you can <unk> it.
I just <unk> my <unk>, like this.
<unk> on the <unk>.
To be sure that nothing <unk> or <unk> from my <unk>.
I'm going to <unk> my <unk> like this.
so you can see that that something can go. We'll be <unk>. We'll have nothing to go.
And the purpose of this is simple.
I started to <unk> my hand, and if everything went well, my <unk> <unk> <unk>.
In fact, it <unk> so <unk> to his place that I can <unk>, and the <unk> doesn't <unk>.
<unk> <unk> or down from my <unk>.
no <unk>. You can <unk> anything.
<unk>!
This is a <unk> that often <unk> to children.
which is <unk> to <unk>, because you can learn a lot about the <unk> <unk>, even if <unk> is very simple.
Many of you in this room <unk> this <unk>.
This is what happens to <unk> the <unk> in my hand.
Let me <unk> my <unk>.
to <unk> that nothing <unk> or <unk> from my <unk>, this is a <unk>.
The reason I'm <unk> the <unk> is because this is the <unk> of <unk>.
In the moment, my hand is moving <unk> from you, this finger here, my <unk>, was <unk> by <unk>, in a position that <unk> out in the so <unk>!
There is somebody who didn't have an <unk> here.
It's so, from here, right here.
And when I also <unk> the finger <unk>.
We can talk about why it is <unk>, because we don't know that there are only three <unk> <unk> because the mind, and the way we <unk> information, not <unk>, one, two, three. <unk> <unk>.
But that's not the point. Right? And when I <unk> my hand, obviously it's not through the animal <unk>, but through the <unk>, I <unk> my <unk> here.
And when I <unk> my finger, same thing, when I go back, this movement <unk> his finger.
<unk> your hand. <unk> comes away.
It's a <unk> that you can do with your friends and <unk>. Thank you.
Now, what does this with <unk> effect?
I read a study, a year ago that <unk> me.
I'm not a doctor or a <unk>, so it was an amazing thing.
that if you look at a <unk> in the form of a <unk> <unk>, it's made like a <unk>, just a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
But if you look at the shape and <unk> the <unk>, under the form of a smaller <unk>, and of color, and you get a letter is <unk> <unk>.
Even though no <unk> -- they're <unk> <unk>.
But a <unk> <unk> is not <unk> as a blue <unk>.
What? It really <unk> me.
But anyway, it's not here that I'm <unk>.
<unk> are <unk> than the <unk> of any form.
A <unk> <unk>, which is <unk> from one side and <unk> on the other is better than a <unk> <unk>.
<unk> has a role.
A <unk> twice a day is not as <unk> as three <unk> -- I don't remember <unk>. <unk>.
But the point is --
that these <unk> have a role.
And the shape has a role.
And if you want the <unk> <unk>, you have to use a <unk>.
Right? A <unk> with something -- a couple of <unk> of something <unk>.
I <unk> it in a patient --
This is a very strong picture in their mind, much <unk> than the <unk> <unk>.
It's real, this <unk> -- I'm going to show you one more time when we get <unk>.
The point is that the <unk> <unk> is not as <unk> as the blue one that is not as a <unk>, which is not as a <unk>.
And nobody of these have a <unk> quality.
It's just your believe that makes them <unk> in your <unk> and <unk> the effect.
I wanted to see if I could take this idea and <unk> to a <unk> <unk>.
And to do something that is a <unk> <unk> and make it real.
And we know from that study that when you want a effect you have to use <unk>.
This is a <unk> of <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
<unk> it a little bit.
This is my meat. This is not special <unk> <unk>.
This is my skin. This is not a <unk> <unk>.
I'm going to <unk> my skin and get this <unk> to the <unk> part.
If you <unk> <unk> -- if you were easily -- I did it for some friends in the <unk> <unk>, the other night, and for some of you who don't know, and a woman is almost <unk>.
So if you could <unk> easily, you'll see that I'm not going to be the next <unk>, you know, I'm going to do the first part of this behind.
You're going to see, you can look from another side.
This is what happens, right here, the beginning of my <unk> to <unk> part of my <unk> arm, I just <unk> a little hole.
<unk>. <unk> you?
And now a little bit through my skin, and out of the other hand, like that.
Now, we're in the same position that we were with the <unk> <unk>.
More or not but you can't <unk> my <unk> now, right?
So I'm going to show you. Here, two, three, four, five, yeah.
I know what people think about when he see it.
He said, "<unk> is not going to be <unk> by <unk> just for a few minutes."
So, let me give you a <unk>.
How do you? It looks like <unk>.
Yeah, I know, I can't see that behind <unk>. "OK, I haven't seen it."
People in the <unk> <unk> are <unk>.
We want to show that.
This is really my skin. It's not a special effect of <unk>.
This is my meat, and I can <unk> around.
<unk>, if you're wrong, if you're <unk>, you don't look.
People at the bottom or <unk> in a few years, the video <unk>, "<unk>, it's clear that some effect, but if it was true.
You can see there's a hole here and a hole here, if it was true. "
Well, now I make a little <unk> for you.
Here is.
Let's <unk> the <unk>.
<unk> my arm, and I'm going to show you that there are no <unk>.
But I think in this context and with the idea of taking something <unk> and <unk> in something true, the <unk> <unk> is, and I <unk> away from the stage.
It's going to take several times in the next few days, I hope you don't know. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
So, in my life I met a lot of fish.
I've only <unk> two.
The first one, <unk> more than another story.
It was a <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> one of the <unk> on the <unk>.
<unk>.
What even better, was being a <unk> <unk> of the most <unk> <unk> <unk>.
So, you're going to place with the <unk> in <unk>.
I've been <unk> in a relationship with this beauty for several months.
One day, the head of the company <unk>, and I <unk> to talk to a <unk> event.
"<unk>" I said.
This was a company that <unk> to solve what's <unk> a <unk> problem for our <unk>.
How do we continue to have the fish in our <unk>?
In the last 50 years we have <unk> in the <unk> in the same way that we <unk> on the ground.
<unk> was <unk>.
<unk> percent of the big fish, the ones that <unk> us so much the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>, <unk>,
There was almost nothing left.
So, we <unk> or not the <unk>, the <unk> of fish, <unk> part of our future.
There's a lot of <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> fish, for the <unk> <unk>, the <unk> of them, and they are <unk>. They <unk> for example.
A great problem is that there is a <unk> of 15 to one.
This means that it takes us 15 <unk> of fish to get a <unk> of <unk>.
It's not very sustainable.
And the <unk> is not a big deal.
So here is, finally, finally, there was a company that <unk> to do it the right way.
I wanted to <unk>.
The first day of the event I <unk> at the <unk> of the company <unk>.
<unk> <unk>.
"<unk>," so I said, "I said," so you're ready to do it so far, in the open sea, which doesn't <unk>. "
"<unk>," <unk>, "he said," We're so <unk> from the <unk> that our <unk> are <unk>, not <unk>. "
And then he said, "We're basically a world."
"The <unk> rate? <unk> to one said.
"The best in the sector."
<unk> to one, great.
"<unk> one thing? What do you want to eat? What do you want to eat?"
"<unk> <unk>," he said.
"<unk>," I said. And I <unk> the <unk>.
That night, I was in bed, <unk>: but what's a sustainable <unk>?
So the next day, little before the event, I still <unk>.
I said, "<unk>, make me some example of <unk> <unk>?"
He said that he didn't, and he would ask me.
Well, let's start with a little bit of people in the company and no one <unk> response.
They finally <unk> with the <unk> <unk>.
He also <unk> him.
"<unk>," I said, "Would you give me some example of <unk> <unk>?"
Well, he <unk> a few <unk> some <unk> <unk> of fish and then said, "<unk> of <unk>."
I said, "<unk> of <unk>?"
He said, "Yes, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> and <unk>."
I said, "<unk> <unk> your <unk> is made of <unk>?"
<unk>, say, two percent.
"Well, that's about 30 percent" said.
And I said, "<unk>, what's sustainable about giving the fish fish to eat <unk>?"
There was a long <unk> on the phone, and then said, "There are so <unk> <unk> in the world."
I <unk> this fish.
No, not because I'm one of those <unk> <unk> of good food and traditional <unk>.
Well, the truth are.
No, in fact, I <unk> about this fish, because I'll tell you after that conversation, the fish knew about <unk>.
The second fish is a different history of love.
It's a <unk> story that's a <unk> story that <unk> the fish and the <unk> <unk>.
I <unk> it for the first time in a <unk> in the <unk> of <unk>.
My <unk> had talked about this fish.
<unk> had done us <unk>.
<unk> on the table had a <unk> white color, almost <unk>.
The <unk> had too <unk>.
We had the <unk> of what it had to be.
<unk>, it was <unk> <unk>.
Who is able to make a good fish after <unk> <unk>?
I don't, but this guy is.
<unk> <unk>.
This is actually called <unk>.
No, he didn't <unk> the fish, and it's not a <unk>.
For the least, not in the sense that they <unk>.
It's a <unk> <unk>. The <unk>, which is a <unk> of fish in the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> to the '<unk> was <unk> by <unk>.
<unk> <unk> on what was essentially a <unk> area.
<unk> <unk> the earth by building a series of <unk> <unk>, so the water in the river.
Well, we couldn't do the thing work from a economic point of view.
And, from the <unk> point of view, it was a <unk>.
He had <unk> something like 90 percent of the birds and, <unk> the place, it's a lot of birds.
So, in <unk> a <unk> company with a <unk> <unk> <unk> the ground.
What <unk>?
<unk> the flow of <unk>.
<unk>, <unk> <unk>.
Instead of <unk> water away from the ground <unk> <unk> to <unk>.
<unk> all the <unk>.
We had a <unk> of fish from <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> and in this process, <unk> and this company completely <unk> the <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> is incredible.
I mean, you've never seen something like this.
<unk> the <unk> that seems to be a million miles away and everything that you see are <unk> <unk> and this <unk>, <unk> land.
I've been there a little time ago with <unk>.
It's an amazing <unk> <unk> <unk> and a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Okay? <unk> <unk> in the middle of this <unk> and I <unk>, <unk>, I had the <unk> to the <unk> and <unk>, <unk> his biology of biology.
First, I <unk> a white <unk>.
And then he <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>. And then he <unk> a kind of <unk> fish that <unk> the <unk> of the <unk>.
<unk> out that <unk> has <unk> a lot of his career at the <unk> <unk> in Africa.
I asked him how he became such a <unk> of fish.
I said, "<unk>? I don't know anything fish.
I'm a <unk> <unk>. "
And immediately, after you're still <unk> on <unk> birds, <unk> and <unk> plants.
Not <unk>, all of this was very fascinating, which is one thing like the <unk> community.
Yeah, but I was <unk>.
And my head <unk> in <unk> to that <unk> fish that I had <unk> at the <unk> <unk>.
So I <unk> him and I said, "<unk>, what makes your fish?"
He <unk> the <unk>.
"I know, I know, <unk>, <unk>, relationships, relationships, yes, is incredible.
But your fish, what do you want?
What is your food <unk>?
Well, I'm going to talk about how their <unk> is a system so <unk> that the fish are <unk> what it's going to happen in an <unk> environment.
The <unk> of plants, the <unk>, the <unk>, is all that <unk> the fish.
The system is so <unk> that <unk> completely.
There are no <unk>.
Do you've ever heard about a <unk> that doesn't give up to her animals?
<unk> later, I was <unk> around the ground with <unk>, and I said, "In a place like this, which seems so different from any <unk> I've ever seen, how do you do to measure the success?"
In that <unk> moment, it was as if the <unk> of a film <unk>.
<unk> the corner and <unk> a scene between the <unk> of the most incredible thousands and thousands of <unk> <unk> a real <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
"That's success," he said.
"<unk> their <unk>, they're <unk>.
<unk> <unk>. "
<unk>? I was completely <unk>.
I said, "<unk>, but they're not <unk> with your fish?"
"Yes," he said.
"<unk> about 20 percent of the fish and the <unk> <unk> for the birds.
<unk> year on this property was <unk> birds more than <unk> species.
It has become the largest one of the most important <unk> <unk> for the birds in Europe. "
He said, "<unk>, but a <unk> population of birds is not the last thing that <unk> in a fish <unk>?"
<unk> your head, no.
<unk>, "We <unk> <unk> <unk> not <unk>.
This is a <unk> network.
<unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> the <unk>.
So, the more the <unk> of the best <unk> is the system. "
OK, then <unk>: A <unk> that doesn't <unk> to eat his own animals, and that measure its <unk> in the health of his <unk>.
A <unk> of fish, but a <unk> for birds.
<unk>, by the way, the <unk> should not even be there.
<unk> <unk> <unk>.
Every morning, <unk> for <unk> miles and come to the <unk> and every night, they do other <unk> miles per <unk>.
They do it because they're able to follow the <unk> line of <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>.
I <unk> something like the <unk> <unk> so <unk> <unk>.
And I said, "<unk>, <unk>, <unk> for <unk> miles into the <unk>, and then <unk> <unk> miles of the night to come back?
Do they do it for their <unk>? "
<unk> me as if I just <unk> a song of <unk> <unk>.
He said, "No, they do it because the food is better."
I didn't tell you about the skin of my <unk> fish that was <unk>, and I usually don't like the <unk> of the fish.
I don't like <unk>, I don't like <unk>.
It's that <unk> <unk>, like <unk>.
<unk> <unk>.
<unk>, when I <unk> it in that <unk> of the <unk> <unk> didn't know about fish <unk>.
He had a <unk> <unk> and <unk> was like giving a <unk> to the ocean.
He <unk> this to <unk>, and he <unk>.
He said, "<unk> is like a <unk>.
It's the last <unk> before anything <unk> in the body of the fish.
It's <unk> for <unk> <unk>. "
And then he said, "But our water didn't <unk>."
Okay. A <unk> that doesn't <unk> his fish.
A <unk> that measure its success on the base of his <unk>.
And then I realized that when he says the <unk> didn't have <unk> <unk> about the thing because the water that <unk> in that <unk> comes from the <unk> river, which is a river that leads to all the things that the <unk> <unk> to bring <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And when it <unk> the system, it's more <unk> than when it's <unk>.
The system is so healthy, that <unk> water.
So, not just a <unk> that doesn't <unk> the animals not just a <unk> that measure its success on the <unk> of his <unk>, but a <unk> that is literally a <unk> of <unk> water and not just for the fish, but also for me and for you.
Because when the water <unk>, you go to the <unk>.
It's a <unk> in the ocean, I know, but I <unk> the <unk>, and so I'm also <unk> to do you because that <unk> is also <unk>.
You could say that it's a <unk> for the future of good food is that it <unk> fish.
What we need now is a <unk> new <unk> of agriculture in which food is really good <unk>.
But for many people, this is a little too <unk>.
We are not <unk>, we <unk> food.
We are <unk>.
<unk> the <unk> of little <unk>.
<unk> the little <unk> <unk>.
<unk> of the local food <unk>.
<unk> <unk>.
And when you believe that these are the things that <unk> the future of good food, somebody somewhere <unk> and says, "<unk> you, you know, even me <unk> <unk>, but how do you think we can <unk> the whole world?
How do you think you can <unk> the world? "
Can I be <unk>?
It's a question that I don't like.
No, not because there's no, not because it's already more than <unk> to be able to <unk> the world.
One billion people <unk> <unk> today.
A billion -- more than there are ever -- because of the huge <unk> in the distribution of <unk>.
You see, I don't like this question because it has <unk> the <unk> of our food system over the last 50 years.
<unk> <unk> to the <unk> <unk> to the <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> to the fish and in all this time, the <unk> industry simply asked, "If we can <unk> more <unk>, what's wrong in what we do?"
This was <unk>.
It was <unk>.
It was the business plan of <unk> agriculture.
<unk> <unk> for what it is, a industry in <unk> a industry that is quickly <unk> the capital that makes it possible.
This is not an industry, and it's not agriculture.
Our <unk> today is <unk> not because of the <unk> in <unk>, but for the <unk> resources in <unk>, but for the <unk> land, not for <unk>, but for the <unk> land, not for <unk>, but for the fish in <unk>.
<unk> <unk> the world?
<unk> <unk>: How are we going to <unk> ourselves?
Or better, how can we create the conditions that <unk> to every local <unk> of <unk> if the same?
To do that, we don't look at the model of the future industry.
It's an old and <unk>.
<unk> everything on capital, chemistry and <unk>, and never really never produced anything good to eat.
Instead, we look at the <unk> model.
It's what I'm going to do on two billion years of experience on work.
<unk> in <unk>, to <unk> like <unk> <unk> and <unk> that are not <unk> <unk> <unk> in itself, which <unk> instead of <unk> <unk> <unk> that are not just <unk> but <unk>, in relationships, because they are the ones that are also <unk> in the <unk>.
If I have to be really <unk>, they're better <unk> than I've ever <unk> to be.
You know, to me, because if that's going to be the future of good food, it will be <unk>.
Thank you.
I grew up with a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk>, an hour back and forth every day.
And I was always <unk> in a book, a book of <unk>, who <unk> my mind in other <unk>, and <unk>, in <unk> form, that <unk> sense of <unk> that I had.
And that <unk> was also in the fact that every time I wasn't in school, I was out in the <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> them to the <unk>.
I was a real <unk> of science.
But it always <unk> to try to understand the world, understanding the <unk> of the possible.
And my love for <unk>, in fact, it seemed to <unk> the world around me, because what was going on, in the late '<unk>, we were going on on the moon, <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> in our <unk> with his <unk> <unk> that <unk> us <unk> animals and a wonderful world that before we couldn't imagine.
So, everything seemed to <unk> my passion for <unk>.
And I was an artist.
We want to draw. <unk> <unk>.
And <unk>, there were no <unk> this <unk> of <unk> film on the computer, not all of these images in the media, I had to create these pictures in my head.
<unk>, when I <unk> a book, everybody <unk>, through the <unk> of <unk>, put something on the screen of our <unk>.
And so, my answer was <unk>, draw <unk> creatures, <unk> creatures, <unk> <unk>, <unk>, all this stuff.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
That's because creativity had to find a <unk> way.
And it's kind of an interesting thing: the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> me a lot for the fact that there was a <unk> world right here on the earth.
<unk> I would never go to a <unk> world on a <unk> <unk>.
<unk> very <unk>.
But that was a world where I could go for really, right here on the earth, the more <unk> and <unk> of what I could ever imagine these books.
So, I decided I would become a <unk> at the age of 15.
And the only problem was that <unk> in a small country of <unk>, <unk> miles from the ocean.
But I didn't left <unk>.
I <unk> my father until she found a <unk> school in <unk>, New York, just spent the <unk> where he was <unk>.
And so I've been able to take the <unk> in a <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk>, New York.
And I couldn't see the ocean, the real ocean, for another two years, until we <unk> in California.
<unk> then, over the last 40 years, I <unk> about <unk> hours <unk> water, and 500 of these hours in <unk>.
And I learned that the <unk> of the ocean, even the <unk> <unk>, are <unk> of life that actually goes beyond our imagination.
The imagination of nature is without <unk> respect to our human imagination.
Again, I'm <unk> from what I see when I do <unk>.
And my story of love with the ocean, the <unk> of how it never was.
But when I <unk> a career, from <unk>, I <unk> to make films.
It has to be the best way to <unk> this <unk> to tell stories with the <unk> of creating images.
And, as a kid, <unk> <unk> <unk> and so on.
So to make films was the only way to put images together and stories.
All <unk>.
And of course, the stories that I <unk> was stories of <unk>: "<unk>," <unk>, "and" The <unk>. "
And with "The <unk>," I <unk> my love for <unk> and <unk> with the <unk> of a film.
So, I <unk> the two <unk>.
from "The <unk>" <unk> "came out something interesting that was <unk> a <unk> problem in that film, which is to create the kind of water <unk>, we <unk> the <unk> with the computer.
And so it was born the first character in the <unk> surface and <unk> to the computer that was ever seen in a film.
And even though the film didn't make a lot of money, you know, I've been <unk> of something extraordinary, all the public was <unk> by this <unk> <unk>.
You know, it's the <unk>'s <unk>'s <unk>'s <unk>'s <unk> by <unk>.
You're seeing something <unk>.
And that <unk> me a lot.
And I thought, "<unk>, this is something that needs to be <unk> in the <unk> art."
So, with "<unk> 2," my next film, we went far beyond.
<unk> with the <unk> <unk> and <unk>, we created the guy from <unk> <unk> in that film. The success <unk> as he would <unk> that effect.
And it has <unk>. And we have again created a <unk>.
And we <unk> the same result with an audience.
But we have <unk> a little bit more with that film.
So, a <unk> between these two <unk> of experience, I came to the <unk> that this would be a new world, was a whole new world, was a whole new world of creativity, for <unk> artists.
<unk>, I <unk> a society with <unk> <unk>, my friend <unk> <unk> <unk>, who was the main <unk> and designers of creatures in that time, and we call it <unk>.
And the principle of society was <unk> to <unk> the past, the <unk> <unk> <unk> and so on, and go directly to the digital production.
And so we did, and he gave us an <unk> <unk> for a while.
But we went back to the <unk> '<unk> in the <unk> part of creatures and characters, which is what we had to <unk> society.
So, I wrote this text <unk> "<unk>" with the <unk> of <unk> <unk> on the <unk> effects, <unk> to the computer, with human characters and all the major computer <unk>, and all of the major <unk> in the computer and the whole world <unk> to the computer.
And it was <unk> to <unk>.
<unk> of society have told me that you couldn't do that for a while.
So, I <unk> it, and I did this film of a <unk> <unk>.
I <unk> it there as a "<unk> and <unk> on a <unk>."
It would be a story of <unk> love, a <unk> film.
<unk>, what I wanted to do was <unk> to see the <unk> <unk>.
That's why I did that film.
And that's true. <unk> didn't know.
But I <unk> them. I said, "We're going to <unk>. I said," We're going to go to the <unk>.
I <unk> it for the beginning of the film.
It's very important. It <unk> a great <unk> <unk>. "
And I <unk> them to <unk> a <unk>.
It looks <unk>. But that <unk> us back to the imagination that creates the reality.
Because we have really created a reality and six months later I <unk> on a <unk> <unk> <unk>, to look at the <unk> <unk> of the North <unk>, to look at the real <unk> from a <unk>, not in a film, not in a film, not in a film, but really.
I was <unk> <unk>.
And there's a lot of <unk>, we had to build <unk> and <unk> and lots of other things.
But I was <unk> by those <unk> <unk> <unk>, was like a <unk> mission.
Where everything was <unk> <unk> and <unk> enormous <unk>.
I'm going to go to this <unk>, you go down to this <unk> environment, where there are no <unk> of being <unk>, which you can't go back to your own.
And I thought, "<unk>. It's like living in a <unk> movie.
It's really great. "
And so, I've been <unk> by the <unk> of the deep ocean.
Of course, <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
It was all. It was <unk>.
It was <unk>. It was imagination.
And it was an experience that <unk> couldn't <unk> me.
Of course, I could imagine a <unk> and make a <unk> effect. But I couldn't imagine what I <unk> out of the <unk>.
In our <unk> <unk>, I saw creatures with <unk> <unk> and, sometimes, things that I had never seen before, things that I had never seen before, that they weren't even <unk> by science at the time we <unk> it and imagine.
So I was all of this and I had to do more.
So I made a <unk> decision.
After the success of <unk>, I said, "OK, I said," OK, come from my <unk> job of <unk> <unk>, and I do the <unk> <unk> for a while. "
So, we started <unk> these <unk>.
We <unk> to go to the <unk> and <unk> with <unk> <unk>.
We're <unk> at the <unk> <unk>.
We took little robots little robots that we had created with <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And the idea was to go into and do a <unk> <unk>, which was never done.
<unk> had ever <unk> within the <unk>. They didn't have <unk> to do it, so we created the technology to do it.
So here we go to the <unk> of the <unk>, <unk> in a <unk>, <unk> the <unk> that <unk> just like this, where I knew they had <unk> <unk>.
And I'm <unk> a little <unk> <unk> <unk> through the <unk> of <unk>.
When I say that, I'm <unk> it, but my mind is in <unk>.
I felt like being <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>.
And it was the most <unk> <unk> experience that ever lived, because I'd ever lived, because I knew what it was behind, before the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, because I had <unk> the <unk> <unk>, because I had a <unk> <unk> for the movie.
And the <unk> was based on a <unk> <unk> of the model of <unk>.
So it was an absolutely extraordinary experience.
And it really <unk> me to make that in the experience of the <unk> that you can <unk> through these <unk> robot, the mind is <unk> in the <unk>, in this other form of existence.
It was very deep.
And it could be a little <unk> of what could happen between some <unk> when you're <unk> to have <unk> for <unk> or other reasons, in some kind of future <unk> that I can imagine, from the <unk> of which I am.
So, we did these <unk>, and we really started to <unk> what was out there, like the <unk> of the ocean where these animals were <unk>.
<unk>, I'm <unk> right here on the Earth.
We live in an <unk> environment.
We don't live in a <unk> system of the sun as we do.
So, you see animals that live close to <unk> of water at 500 degrees <unk>.
<unk> even impossible.
At the same time, I was <unk> a lot of <unk> science, once again, it's the influence of <unk>, as a boy.
And I ended up in the <unk> environment, really <unk> with NASA <unk>, <unk> in the NASA <unk> of <unk>, to go to <unk>, to <unk>, to go to <unk>, to go to <unk> <unk> <unk>, and all of these things, to fly to the <unk> <unk> <unk> with our <unk>.
It was fascinating.
But what I finished to do is to take the <unk> scientists with us in <unk>.
And you can get <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, scientists, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> them down and <unk> them to see, take <unk>, <unk> and so on.
So, we were <unk> <unk>, but we actually <unk> science, <unk> science.
I had <unk> the <unk> between the being <unk>, as a boy, to do those things.
And you know, in this <unk> of discovery, I learned a lot.
I learned a lot of science. But I also learned a lot about <unk>.
Everybody thinks a <unk> <unk> to be a leader, the <unk> of <unk>, or something like that.
I didn't know about <unk> before I do all those <unk>.
Because at some point I had to say, "What am I doing here?"
Why am I doing this? What do I mean? "
It doesn't <unk> anything to do these <unk>.
We go to <unk>. There's no <unk>.
People think it's gone between "<unk>" and "<unk>" and "<unk>," that I <unk> the <unk> <unk> on some <unk>.
I did all these films, all these <unk> for a public <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, no <unk>, no money. What am I doing?
I'm doing this for the <unk>, for the challenge -- and the ocean is the largest challenge that we <unk>, for the <unk> of discovery, and for the strange <unk> that you get when a little group of people in a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Because I <unk> everything with <unk> people, working together for years.
Sometimes in <unk> for <unk> months of <unk>.
And in that <unk>, you realize that the important thing is about respect you have for them and who have for you, when you've <unk> a job that you can't explain to any other.
When you go to the ground and you say, "We have to do this, and the <unk> <unk>, and that, and that, and the <unk>, and the <unk>, the <unk> of human <unk> when you're working on the <unk> <unk>, you can't explain it. It's the thing that you may only have the <unk> or the soldiers that you can never <unk>.
<unk> a <unk>, create a <unk> respect.
When I came up to do my <unk> film, which is "<unk>" I've tried to <unk> the same principle of <unk> <unk> <unk> team and <unk> their respect.
It's really <unk> <unk>.
And so I'm going to do once again with a little group, in <unk> <unk> to do "<unk> with new technologies that will not <unk> before.
<unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>.
And we're <unk> a family, in the <unk> of four and a half years.
And it changed completely my way of making films.
People have <unk> saying that I took the organisms from the ocean and I <unk> them on the planet.
For me, it was the <unk> of how to do business, the process itself, which changed.
What can we <unk>?
What are the <unk> that we've learned?
I think the first is <unk>.
It's the most powerful thing that we <unk>.
The imagination is a force that can actually <unk> a reality.
And the group is more important than all of the <unk> of the world.
<unk> <unk> are from me and they say, "<unk> a few <unk> to do this."
And I said, "Don't <unk> <unk>.
<unk> people <unk> it for you, they don't <unk> on yourself, don't <unk> against yourself.
And <unk> <unk>. "
NASA is always saying this <unk>: "The <unk> is not <unk>."
But the <unk> has to be a <unk> in art and <unk>, because it's like a <unk> in <unk>.
And no important <unk> that has <unk> innovation was done without <unk>.
They should be <unk> to <unk> these <unk>.
This is the thought I want to <unk>, which I want to <unk>, which is a <unk>, but the fear doesn't. Thank you.
If you want to understand a single idea that would be that the <unk> of the data that <unk> is bigger than the <unk> of its parts, and what, instead of thinking about the <unk> information, I'd like to think about how to use information to <unk> new relationships, so that you can think about how to use information to make new <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
And here you can see some <unk> <unk> <unk> for age.
This tool that use is a little experiment.
It's called <unk>, and with <unk> I can choose one cause of death, let's say <unk>.
And then we see <unk> new relationships.
The reason is that here in the central part, people are <unk>; and here instead are more <unk>.
We can take a step back and <unk> data for death, let's see that <unk> disease and cancer are the biggest <unk>, but not for all.
If we go and <unk> for age, let's say 40, we see that <unk> are the cause of death.
It's <unk> closer, it's <unk> for men.
So you can understand that information and data that's a little bit like <unk> in a <unk> <unk> information.
And if we can do it with <unk> data, why don't we do it with <unk>?
For example, we have the <unk> of every <unk> <unk> ever <unk>.
That's all over here.
You can <unk> it in your <unk>, and even you.
You can look at a <unk>.
Or a <unk> year.
You can <unk> a <unk> number.
For example, let's take <unk> in this number, their <unk>.
I'm a <unk> <unk> <unk>, so I'm going to go here and I see all the numbers of <unk> <unk>.
Now, if I want to take a look, I could think, "Why don't I look at all the <unk>?"
We had a step back and <unk> the <unk>.
And now I see <unk> <unk>.
You have to know, you know, when I'm going to talk about the <unk> in this information, not just a research, it's not just a research, it's not the usually <unk>.
But you do something different.
It's a way of a second that we <unk> to use information.
I still think this idea that may seem a little <unk>.
We've taken every single page of <unk>, and we <unk> it to a little <unk> that <unk> in a little <unk>, and a <unk> that will <unk> the <unk> area.
I'm just going to show you the first 500 of the <unk> <unk>.
Even in this <unk> <unk>, we can do a lot.
They <unk> right now which <unk> are the <unk> <unk> on <unk>.
At this point they <unk> <unk>.
In this <unk>, we see that the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This is <unk> because it's <unk> something that in the pages of <unk>.
And you can see it only <unk> by <unk>.
If you take one of these <unk>, I can then <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
and <unk> everybody.
At this point, I see most <unk> <unk> from <unk> some of the world of science. A <unk> number from the world of business.
Here's my <unk>.
One is from music.
And, rather interesting, <unk> has also won a TED <unk>.
So I started to see all the <unk> of the TED <unk>.
For the first time we're really <unk> on the net as if it was a network, not from page to page, but at a <unk> level.
I want to show you another thing that could <unk> you.
This is the New York Times site.
<unk>, this <unk> -- I don't call it <unk>, because it's not a <unk>, but it's going to be able to still see pages -- and we'll <unk> this technology to every page, like this.
I can do a step back and immediately go back to a <unk> <unk>. This is important because the only of seeing the web pages to me, so you can see my whole <unk> in the Internet.
I can <unk> on what I did in <unk> moments.
In fact, you can see the state of <unk> that I just <unk>.
I can <unk> some other things that I've seen in the day.
If I want to take a step back and see everything I can do to <unk> my <unk> or the <unk> of my research.
So, here we <unk> the <unk> engine, <unk> the <unk> engine, here for <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And I can <unk> on my page here, I can just <unk> up here.
A <unk> <unk> a lot of times, and in any case, the result is greater than the <unk> of the parts, of <unk> data.
<unk>, in the world, the data is <unk> as a kind of <unk>.
It's about <unk> of information.
It's about <unk> in data.
And if we were all <unk> if we <unk> the web <unk> instead of going from one thing to another, it will allow us to move from many things to many other things to be able to see the structures that <unk> <unk>?
And then instead of <unk> <unk> in the data we can actually <unk> that information.
Instead of <unk> only information, we can <unk> out of knowledge.
And by knowledge, you know, maybe it comes to the <unk>.
And with that <unk> you.
They all talk about happiness.
I asked to <unk> the number of books, the word "happiness" in <unk> and <unk> over the last five years, have <unk> of <unk> after <unk> 40, and there were many more.
There's a huge <unk> of interest on happiness, <unk>.
There's very <unk> of happiness.
Everybody <unk> to make people <unk>.
But <unk> all this <unk> of work, there are a series of <unk> <unk> that somehow make <unk> impossible ideas on happiness.
My talk today is <unk> these "<unk> <unk>."
And it's <unk> people who think about their happiness, and it's about <unk> that <unk> happiness, because it turns out we are <unk> like all others.
The first of these <unk> is the <unk> to <unk> complexity.
In fact, that the word happiness is no longer a word as a <unk> <unk>.
I believe that you can <unk> to a particular meaning, but in the <unk> line, <unk> <unk> of this <unk> and <unk> <unk> the <unk> view of what the <unk> is what the <unk> is.
The second <unk> is the <unk> of experience and memory: it's basically what it is about to be happy with being in life and happy about your life.
And these are two different <unk> of them, both part of the concept of happiness.
And the third is the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> that we can't think of any <unk> that <unk> on the <unk> without <unk> the <unk>.
I mean, it's a real <unk> <unk>.
and there is no way to do the right thing.
I'd like to start with an example of a person who, after a <unk> of questions and answers, after my lesson, <unk> a story.
[<unk>] <unk>] that while you <unk> a <unk> of <unk> music, right at the end of the <unk>, <unk> a <unk> sound.
And then <unk>, very <unk> <unk>, who had <unk> the whole experience.
But it wasn't true.
What was <unk> was the <unk> of the experience.
He had the experience.
And she had <unk> for 20 minutes of wonderful music.
but it didn't work for anything because he <unk> with a certain <unk>; I remember, and the <unk> was all the <unk>.
What this <unk> tells us, at the bottom, is that we can think about ourselves and other people in terms of two <unk>.
There's a <unk> that lives of the experiences, which lives in the present and <unk> the present, and it's capable of <unk> the past, but it just <unk> the present.
It's the <unk> that lives of the experiences and which the <unk> <unk> -- you know when the <unk>, "<unk> <unk> you now?"
And then there is the "itself that <unk>," is the "<unk>" that <unk> "that <unk> the <unk>, and it <unk> of the history of our life, and that is the" <unk> "to which the <unk> <unk> <unk>," How are you heard in the last days? "
or "<unk> is <unk> your journey?" or something similar. "
<unk> are two different <unk>, the same as a experience, and what if the <unk>, and <unk> between the two is part of the <unk> on the <unk> of happiness.
The <unk> that is a <unk>.
And this process process starts with a fundamental answer of our <unk> -- it immediately.
We don't tell stories just when we try to <unk>.
Our memory tells stories, <unk>, what <unk> us is a story.
Let me start with an example.
It's an old study.
<unk> the experiences of two patients in a <unk> <unk>.
It's not even <unk> me in <unk>. It's not even even <unk> a day of today, but it was <unk> when this study was <unk> in the '<unk>.
It <unk> to patients their pain every 60 seconds.
And here are the results for two patients.
<unk> are their <unk>.
If you ask, "What about the two <unk>?"
It's a very simple question.
<unk>, the <unk> <unk> more.
His <unk> <unk> <unk> more and for every minute of <unk> <unk> from the patient. At the <unk> patient has <unk> at least as a <unk>.
But now there's another question: "How much these patients think they have <unk>?"
and here's the <unk>: <unk> <unk>. A had a <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
The stories of the <unk> were different given that one particularly part of the <unk> is the way that we <unk> -- none of these stories is particularly <unk> -- but one of the two is particularly <unk>.
And the <unk> is that where the pain was <unk> in the final moment.
It's a <unk> story.
How do I <unk>?
Because we asked these people after the <unk>, and even a distance of time, "How much was the experience, all <unk>?"
and <unk> <unk> <unk>.
So this is a <unk> <unk> between the <unk> that lives the experiences and the <unk> that <unk>.
In the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> has <unk> <unk>.
So, what you could do for the patient, and we have <unk> experiments, and we have <unk> experiments, and it really works, you could <unk> the <unk> <unk>. At the <unk> without <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This <unk> a little bit of pain in the patient, but only a bit, and much less than before.
And doing this for a couple of minutes, the <unk> that lives the experience of the <unk>. At worse, and the <unk> that <unk> the experiences of <unk>. In fact,, the <unk> of <unk>.
How do you tell a story?
And that's true for the stories that come from the <unk> of the stories that are from the <unk> that are the changes the <unk> moments and <unk>.
<unk> are very, very important and, in this case, the final has <unk>.
So, the <unk> that lives the experience of her life <unk>.
It has times where you live experiences. And you know, what happens to these moments?
And the answer is simple.
They're <unk> to say that most of the moments of our life -- as I <unk> them -- I mean, the present <unk> is <unk> about three seconds, which means that in a life, you know about <unk> million. In a month, you know, there's about <unk> million. In a month, you know, there's about <unk> million <unk>.
Most of them are completely <unk> by the <unk>.
And yet, in some way you have the feeling that they should <unk>, what happens in these moments of experience is our life.
It's the <unk> resources that we are <unk> as we are in this world.
And as a <unk>, <unk> <unk>, but it's not the story that the <unk> <unk> for us.
So, we have a <unk> that <unk> and a <unk> that lives are different experiences.
The biggest difference between the two is like <unk> time.
In the point of view of the <unk> that lives the experiences, if you go to <unk>, and the second week is as the first one, then the <unk> of two weeks better than a week.
But that's not the way the <unk> works that <unk>.
For the <unk> that <unk>, a <unk> of two weeks is <unk> better than a week of <unk> because there are no new <unk> in <unk>.
You haven't changed the story.
And in this way, time is the <unk> <unk> that <unk> the <unk> that <unk> from the <unk> that lives of the experiences.
<unk> has a <unk> impact on this story.
<unk>, the <unk> that <unk> <unk> experiences more than <unk> and tell stories.
It's actually the <unk> that makes decisions, because if you take a patient who had, for example, two <unk> with two different <unk>, and it's going to <unk> what he's going to be the doctor that he <unk> is what he's going to happen.
The <unk> that live the experiences has no voice in these choices.
In fact, we don't <unk> between, but between the <unk> of those experiences.
And even when we think about our future, we don't think about our future as experiences.
<unk> to our future as <unk> <unk>.
So, basically you can <unk> this situation, like a <unk> of the <unk> that <unk>, and you can think of the <unk> that <unk> as if you <unk> the <unk> that lives in the experiences, not need.
I have the feeling that when we go to <unk>, we often <unk> the case that, <unk> in <unk> in good part of the service of our <unk> <unk>.
And this is a little difficult to <unk>.
<unk>, how much <unk> our <unk>?
This is one of the <unk> that is <unk> for the <unk> <unk>.
When I think about that, I think of a <unk> in the <unk> of a few years ago, which is one of the best <unk> of my life, and that I think <unk> often, respect to the other <unk>.
And probably I've been thinking about the <unk> of that journey three weeks, to say, 25 minutes in the last four years.
If I've ever opened the <unk> with the <unk> photographs of the journey, I would <unk> another time. This is about three weeks of journey that <unk> in <unk> an hour and <unk>. It looks like that there is a <unk>.
<unk>, I could be a little <unk>, in my <unk> <unk> <unk>, but even though you <unk> more of this, a <unk> question is <unk>.
Why do we make a lot of the memory respect to the weight that we take a experiences?
I want you to think of an experiment with thinking.
Imagine that during the <unk> <unk> <unk> that at the end of the <unk> <unk>, and that I <unk> a <unk> for the <unk> <unk>. It doesn't <unk> anything.
<unk> the same <unk>? And if you want to choose a different <unk>, you create a <unk> between the two <unk> and you have to think about how to solve that <unk> and <unk>, it's not as <unk>, because, if you think in terms of time, you have an answer.
And if you think in terms of <unk>, you can get another answer.
because we <unk> the <unk> that we do, is a problem that <unk> us with two <unk>.
The two <unk> <unk> of <unk>.
In fact, two <unk> of <unk> that we can use, one for any <unk>.
So you can ask: How <unk> is happy that makes the experience?
And then you can ask: How much happy is the moments in the <unk> life that lives?
And it's about <unk> happiness for moments. It's a <unk> process.
What are the emotions that we can measure?
And, anyway, now we're able to make a good idea of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> that lives in time.
If you talk about <unk> happiness, it's a completely different thing.
It's not how much a <unk> person.
It's about how <unk> or <unk> is the person in his life.
It's a very different idea.
They're not going to be able to <unk> these two <unk>, they're not going to be able to do in the studies of happiness, and I <unk> to a group of students, who have <unk> studies of happiness for a long time in this way.
The difference between happiness, the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> has been <unk> in the last few years, and there are now <unk> for measure the two <unk>, the <unk> <unk> has a <unk> level of the world where more than a half a million people have been <unk> to a <unk> on what they think about their life and their own experiences.
And there were other studies in this direction.
So in the last few years, we started <unk> on happiness of the two <unk>.
And the biggest lesson that we've learned, is that they are very different.
You want to know how much a person is <unk> with your life, and yet that doesn't tell you much about how much <unk> <unk> <unk> your life.
To give you an idea of <unk>, <unk> is about <unk>.
What does it mean if you take somebody, and you say, "<unk>, his father is <unk>," How much <unk> of his <unk>? "
Well, <unk> something about his <unk>, but with a lot of <unk>.
You always have a little bit of <unk>.
If I tell you that somebody thinks his life is at eight, in a very <unk> <unk> <unk> on how happy they are with their <unk> who live with their <unk> that lives the experiences.
So <unk> is low.
We have a certain knowledge of what <unk> the <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
We know the money is very important, <unk> are very important.
We know that being happy to be <unk> with the people who <unk> us, <unk> of time with people <unk>.
There are other <unk> <unk>, but these are the main ones.
So if you want to <unk> happiness of the two <unk>, you're doing very different things.
The <unk> of what I said is that we shouldn't think about happiness as a <unk> of <unk>.
It's two completely different ideas.
<unk>, very quickly, another reason that we can't think of <unk> <unk> to happiness is that we don't <unk> attention to happiness is that we don't <unk> attention to the same things when we think about life.
<unk>, if you do the simple question about how happy the <unk> is in California, you can't get the <unk> response.
When you ask this question, you think you're <unk> to be <unk> in California, that in <unk>.
What happens is, when you think about life in California, you're thinking about the <unk> between California and other places, and for example is climate.
<unk>, let's say that climate is not so important for the <unk> that lives of the experiences and not very important for the <unk> that <unk> that is what's going to tell the people.
But you <unk> the <unk> that <unk> is in <unk>, you could end -- some people, at the end, <unk> to California.
And it's interesting to what's going to happen to people who are <unk> in California to be <unk>.
<unk>, the <unk> that lives are not going to be happy.
We know that.
But it was a <unk> thing. It was <unk> to be <unk>, because when you think about it, you know how bad time was in <unk>.
And I thought I made the right decision.
It's very hard to think about <unk>, and I think I'm going to <unk> this idea of how difficult it is.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: Thank you. I have a question for you.
Thank you very much.
When we were on the phone a couple of weeks ago, I <unk> that an interesting result that is <unk> from the <unk> of <unk>.
Is it something you think we can share with that we still have a few minutes?
<unk> <unk>: Yeah.
I think the most interesting <unk> that we found in the <unk> <unk> is a number, that we don't have to do that.
We found that, with <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> that lives the experiences.
When we <unk> as we have <unk> with <unk> income, we found that, under a <unk> income per year, for Americans, on a study <unk> <unk> on a very <unk> <unk> of about <unk> Americans, on a very <unk> <unk> of about <unk> American, it's a <unk> <unk>, under a very <unk> <unk> of about <unk> dollars a <unk> a year --
CA: <unk> <unk> <unk>: <unk> <unk> dollars a year, people are <unk>, and they become more <unk> <unk> as they become more <unk>, Al <unk>.
I want to say, I've seen <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk>, what happens is that the money doesn't <unk> happiness, but the <unk> of money, but the <unk> of money, and we can measure measure that <unk> that <unk>.
In terms of the other <unk>, the <unk> that <unk>, is all another story.
More money, the more <unk> six.
This talk't about emotions on emotions.
CA: But <unk>, all the <unk> of <unk> <unk> life, the freedom, the <unk> of happiness.
If people <unk> <unk> this discovery, basically <unk> all of the thing we have <unk>, for example, politics on <unk> and so on.
<unk> the chance that <unk>, and the country in general, can take a <unk> of discovery like that <unk> and take a public policy policy policy on it?
<unk>: I think that <unk> the role of happiness in public politics.
The <unk> <unk> is going to be <unk> in the United States is not <unk>, but in the <unk> <unk>, it's becoming, and in <unk> <unk>.
People are starting to recognize that they should think about happiness when they think about the public politics.
You <unk> a little bit and people <unk> to <unk> if you want to study the experience of happiness or if you want to study the life of which we need to start this <unk> to the <unk> <unk>.
As a <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> different <unk> on how you think, and what you think about the <unk> or the <unk> that <unk> or the <unk> that makes the experiences.
This is all about politics, I think, in the '<unk>.
In the United States, they're doing <unk> to measure the experience of the population.
And that, I think, <unk> to be part of the next <unk>, maybe two, of the <unk> <unk>.
CA: <unk>, <unk>, it seems to me that <unk> is going to be, the most interesting politics to follow in the next few years.
Thank you very much for invented the economy.
Thank you very much <unk>.
I'm going to talk about energy and climate.
It may be strange, because in my work at <unk> <unk>, <unk> me of <unk> and <unk>, things that <unk> and give the world to help the two billion people live.
But climate and energy, in fact, are extremely important for these people, <unk>, are more important for them than anyone else in the world.
A climate means, for many years, <unk> of <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk>, or too <unk>.
<unk> things in ways that their environment simply can't support.
which leads to <unk>. <unk> <unk>. <unk> <unk>.
So the <unk> <unk> are going to be for them.
Even the cost of the energy is, for them, important.
In fact, if you were to <unk> the price of one thing, to <unk> poverty, <unk> of great energy.
The price of energy is <unk> over time.
And a <unk> civilization through progress in <unk>.
The <unk> revolution <unk> that industrial.
And in the <unk> century, we have <unk> to an <unk> in the price of electricity, which <unk> why we have <unk>, <unk>, we can create <unk> materials and do that so many things.
In the <unk> world, so we're about electricity in a <unk> situation.
But as the price <unk>, for instance, we have to <unk> a new <unk>, the <unk> of CO2 emissions.
<unk> is <unk> the planet, and its <unk> is very simple.
<unk> CO2 <unk> causes a temperature <unk>, which is very <unk> effects.
<unk> to climate and, perhaps even worse, <unk>, <unk>, in the sense that natural <unk> can't <unk> these <unk> changes and so <unk>.
The <unk> of how they <unk> the temperature because of a <unk> <unk> <unk>, and how they <unk> the other things, is <unk>, but not very much.
And there's certainly <unk> about how much <unk> are going to be <unk>, but certainly will be extremely <unk>.
At this, I have often asked the best scientists, do we have to <unk> emissions?
Can't just <unk> to half or <unk>?
And the answer is that, as long as not <unk> to zero, <unk> temperature.
It's a big challenge, so.
It's not like, "We want to take a high <unk> <unk> <unk>."
It's not a <unk>.
It's about <unk> <unk>.
Now, we <unk> a lot of CO2 every year, over <unk> billion <unk>.
<unk> 20 <unk> for every American.
For the poor countries, it's less than a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The world media is about five <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And in some way, we have to do <unk> that <unk> that <unk> to zero.
<unk> are <unk> <unk>.
Just some <unk> changes this <unk> changed this <unk>, so we have to go from <unk> <unk> to zero.
This <unk> has four <unk>.
It's a series of <unk>.
We have the <unk> on the left, the CO2, which <unk> to be <unk>, and the <unk> on the right is the <unk> population, the services that in any person uses, the average energy <unk> for <unk> of energy.
<unk> <unk> <unk>, and we see how we can <unk>.
<unk>, one of these numbers must be <unk> at almost zero.
It's <unk> <unk>.
We see a little bit.
The first <unk> is population.
The world has <unk> billion <unk> today.
We <unk> to the <unk> billion.
If we do a good job with the new <unk>, the health, the health, we can <unk> maybe about 10, 15 percent, but here we're going to be an increase about 30 percent.
The second <unk> is the services we use.
which <unk> everything, the food that <unk>, the <unk>, the TV.
They're <unk> things, and <unk> of poverty is to <unk> these services for almost everyone in the world.
And it's a <unk> thing that this <unk> number.
In the <unk> world, in the <unk> billion, probably we can <unk> and use less, but on average, every year, this <unk> number.
And so, <unk>, the amount of services <unk> <unk> is going to be more than <unk>.
This is a very simple example of service.
You have the <unk> in your house, to do the <unk>, but these guys don't, so <unk> and <unk> their <unk> under the <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> -- and, energy for <unk> <unk> -- and here's good news.
This <unk> is not <unk>.
Thank you very much <unk>, new ways of <unk>, <unk> made <unk>, <unk> <unk>, for many services, you can <unk> energy.
In some services, you can reduce 90 percent.
There are other services, like <unk>, or the <unk> plane, where the <unk> <unk> are very, very <unk>.
So, <unk>, in the best cases, energy <unk> <unk> <unk> from three to perhaps six times.
But these first three <unk> <unk> emissions from <unk> to, in the best cases, maybe <unk> billion <unk>.
It's not enough.
<unk> <unk>, the key <unk>, the key, the <unk> of CO2 <unk> for <unk> of energy.
The question is, can we <unk> to zero?
If you <unk>, no.
If you make natural gas, no.
We <unk> all ways to produce today electricity, part of the <unk> and nuclear, <unk> CO2.
So what you want to do on a global scale, is to create a new system.
And we need <unk>.
<unk>, "<unk>," I don't mean something impossible.
<unk> is a <unk>. The computer is a <unk>.
The Internet, and its services, I'm a <unk>.
People today have <unk> to the creation of many <unk>.
We usually don't have a <unk>, a <unk> that we <unk> the <unk>.
<unk>, it's in the <unk>, and something else doesn't.
In this case we have to drive at all, and make a <unk> in a very <unk> time.
I <unk>: How do you do this concept?
Is there some <unk> example, some <unk> that <unk> people's imagination?
I <unk> a year ago, when I <unk> <unk>, and people <unk> <unk>.
We <unk> them in the world, there are people who are <unk> with <unk>.
This is my idea for energy.
I decided that to fly <unk> would be this year my <unk> to the environment.
Here are <unk>.
I say that they don't <unk>, <unk> may not get out of the <unk>.
Now, we can <unk> <unk> like this, but they're not going to be help.
We need solutions, one or many that are, that <unk> on a lot of <unk> and very <unk>, and <unk> is <unk> in many <unk>, I think only about five <unk> <unk> effects.
I <unk> the <unk>, <unk>, nuclear <unk>, <unk>.
I also want to give some <unk>, and if they can do more than I <unk>, so much better, but here I'm interested in the <unk> that we're going to work on <unk> of these five, and they don't work on <unk> <unk> of them.
<unk> for the first <unk> of <unk> <unk>, <unk> or natural gas that is.
This is our task seems simple, but it's not, and it's <unk> CO2, after <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
Now, there are <unk> technologies that <unk> 60 -- 80 percent of CO2, but get to 100 percent is going to be very hard, and it's going to be able to agree on where all of that CO2 <unk>.
The <unk> question is about the time.
Who <unk>?
Who do something that is literally billions of times more <unk> than any other kind of <unk> <unk>, like nuclear, or whatever nuclear?
It's a huge <unk>.
So it's a difficult problem.
Another source would be nuclear.
But also, nuclear <unk> three big problems.
The cost, especially in the very <unk> countries, is high.
The issue of security, the <unk> <unk> that nothing can go <unk>, <unk> the <unk> is <unk> by human <unk>, and that the <unk> is not <unk> to <unk>.
And how do you <unk> <unk>?
<unk> the <unk>, the <unk> are many.
People need to be <unk>.
So we have a lot of problems, which you might solve, and what you should work.
<unk> three of the five <unk> I <unk> them.
These are the people often called "<unk>."
And to say the true, <unk> the great <unk> of <unk>, <unk> some <unk>.
The first is that the energy <unk> <unk> with these technologies is <unk> <unk> to that one central power.
It's about <unk> energy, and so many miles <unk>, of a lot of <unk> miles of a normal <unk>.
<unk> these <unk> are <unk>.
The sun doesn't <unk> all day, not <unk> all the time.
<unk>, if you <unk> from these <unk>, you have to find a way of <unk> power even when the source doesn't make it.
<unk> challenges us on the front of the cost.
And the distribution of the distribution.
For example, let's say that this <unk> is at <unk>.
So you don't just need the technology, but you also have to do the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And finally, the problem of <unk>.
To <unk> the size of the problem, I <unk> all kinds of <unk> <unk> today, for cars, <unk>, any kind, I've <unk> it with the amount of electric energy <unk> in the world, and discovered that all the <unk> now in the world, and discovered that all the <unk> now in production may be <unk> less than 10 minutes of all of that energy.
So we really need a big step forward, a <unk> of 100 times than <unk> <unk>.
which is not impossible, but it's not very simple.
This problem <unk> already when the <unk> "<unk>" <unk> "more than the <unk>, say, 20 or 30 percent of the <unk> energy.
If you take those <unk> for 100 percent, you need a <unk> <unk>.
But how do you <unk> on this street? What's the right approach?
Is it a <unk> <unk>? What could solve the problem?
A lot of companies, hundreds, they have to <unk> work.
We need at least a hundred people in each of these five <unk>.
Many of them, <unk>, <unk> <unk> them. That's good.
And I think here in the TED group, a lot of <unk> people already working in these <unk>.
Bill <unk> has different companies, between which a call that <unk> great technologies in the solar <unk>.
<unk> <unk> is <unk> in <unk> <unk> that are doing big things and have interesting, and I'm <unk> my <unk> to all this.
<unk> <unk> and I are <unk> a company that, <unk> you, <unk> the nuclear way.
There were some <unk> in <unk>, nuclear <unk>, nuclear <unk>.
But it's a nice bit of time, the sector is <unk>, that there are some good ideas around is not so amazing.
The idea of <unk> is that, instead of <unk> only part of the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>, we decided to <unk> the <unk>, and we decided to <unk> the <unk>, <unk> percent of the <unk> available, in a certain sense.
For the truth of the truth of a long time, but it's never been <unk> if it would <unk> or not, just because of the <unk> of the <unk> today you can do a <unk> and see that yes, with <unk> materials, it looks like <unk>.
And <unk> <unk> <unk> percent of the <unk>, the structure of the <unk> costs.
You <unk> <unk>, and you use it as well as <unk> <unk> <unk>.
They <unk> the <unk> <unk>. It's a kind of <unk>.
It's like a <unk> <unk> <unk>. <unk> is called <unk> <unk>.
In the point of view, the problem is <unk>.
Here's a picture of a place in <unk>.
This is the <unk>, <unk> percent of the <unk>, which was <unk> the part of the time <unk> like <unk>, and so called <unk> <unk>.
These <unk> <unk> power to the United States for <unk>.
And we <unk> the water, with an economic process, there would be enough to the rest of the life of this planet.
So, a lot of challenges, but this is an example of the hundreds of ideas that we need to <unk>.
How should we measure our progress?
What should <unk> <unk>?
<unk> the goal, and then <unk> the <unk> <unk>.
You've heard a lot of people talking about a <unk> of 80 percent for <unk>, it's very important to <unk>.
20 percent will be produced by <unk> countries, and from a while agriculture.
At that point, we'll have <unk> the <unk> and the production of the <unk>.
To get to 80 percent, so, <unk> countries like China, <unk> countries like China, should have been completely <unk> their own <unk>.
The other question is, are we <unk> this technology emissions?
Do we <unk> it in <unk> countries?
<unk> we're <unk> <unk>?
It's a <unk> <unk>.
It's a key <unk> of <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, what should it be the <unk> of <unk>?
It should also have the same two <unk>.
We had <unk> <unk> <unk> to start <unk> to get <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, <unk> will be the amount of CO2, and so the temperature.
But the <unk> in this matter, doing things that don't <unk> great <unk>, has a <unk> weight, or <unk> <unk> <unk>, to the other, which is the speed of innovation new <unk>.
We have to <unk> these <unk> <unk>, and we can measure the speed from companies, <unk>, <unk> of <unk>.
A lot of <unk> books have been <unk> about it.
The book from Al <unk>, "<unk>," <unk>, "<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>."
These books <unk> the problem and they create a context in which they <unk> the <unk> because these things <unk> of a <unk> <unk>.
A lot of things have to <unk> <unk>.
So I have a wish.
A very <unk> for <unk> technology.
If you want to choose one wish for the next 50 years, between: we can choose the <unk> of the country, the <unk> of the country, the <unk> of a lot, or doing this thing that's <unk> costs and not <unk> CO2, <unk> this last.
It would be the biggest impact.
If this <unk> is not <unk>, the <unk> between the people who think in a short term, between the United States and China, between <unk> and China, between <unk> and <unk>, it will be <unk>, and especially, life of those two billion people will be <unk>.
So what do we have to do?
What am I going to do I'm going to take the <unk> and <unk>?
It's necessary for a larger <unk>.
When countries are <unk> in places like <unk>, they don't have to talk about CO2.
You can also <unk> the program, and I'm going to tell you about how it's <unk> <unk> in these <unk> <unk>.
We need <unk>, <unk> on CO2, <unk> and <unk>, <unk>, tools that <unk> the cost of <unk>.
We have to <unk> the message.
We have to make this <unk> and <unk>, and it has to <unk> the choices of the government.
It's a <unk> wish, but I think <unk>.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: Thank you. Thank you.
Thanks.
first of all, can you <unk> an idea of the size of the <unk>?
Bill <unk>: <unk> the software, <unk> the <unk>, <unk> all of the big scientists, which we already have done, only <unk> of millions, and even when we have <unk> the materials in a <unk> <unk>, to be <unk> that we can <unk>, <unk> only hundreds of millions.
The difficult thing is to build the <unk> <unk>, to <unk> billion, the <unk> <unk>, the place that we built the first <unk>.
Once built the first one, if it works like <unk>, it will be the <unk> of <unk>, because the cost, the <unk> of energy <unk>, are completely different from nuclear nuclear nuclear <unk> that we know today.
CA: So, if you do well, this <unk> the building, <unk> <unk>, of a <unk> <unk> full of nuclear <unk>, of this kind of <unk> <unk>.
Then the process starts from the top and <unk> up?
<unk>: Right. <unk>, are <unk> <unk>, a lot of people who can't work, <unk> <unk>, things that <unk> and <unk> --
It's not good.
If the <unk> is very cheap, and you can <unk> it for 60 years, put it in and <unk> all of those complexity.
<unk> there, <unk> for <unk> years, and then <unk>.
CA: A nuclear nuclear nuclear <unk> that <unk>.
<unk>: Yes. Well, the <unk> can leave there, and then you can take it, <unk> in another <unk> and <unk>.
And <unk> with the <unk> already <unk>, now <unk> <unk> in <unk> or <unk> near the <unk>.
<unk> our first <unk>.
So what was a problem of the <unk> <unk> is going to be the <unk> of our <unk>, and the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> in a <unk> way, not just this process is going to be.
CA: But when I <unk> around the world of potential of this technology, where most interest in his <unk>?
<unk>: Well, there is no place in particular, and there are all these interesting rules of <unk> on everything that is nuclear nuclear <unk>, so we're going to get a lot of interest.
Our <unk> was in <unk>, India, China.
I just met the <unk> for <unk>.
We've been talking about how this idea is the current program.
They're <unk>. <unk> and <unk> did work in this field.
It's a <unk> on something that's already done.
It's a quick <unk>, but it's a quick kind of <unk>, which many countries have built, so anyone who's already built a quick <unk> is a good <unk> to <unk> our.
CA: In your <unk>, what are the <unk> and the <unk> of something like that <unk>?
<unk>: Well, for one of these projects at a whole thing, which <unk> energy, which is not so much, we talk about 20 years for 20 years and for 20 to <unk>.
This is the <unk> that the <unk> that the <unk> <unk> to be <unk>.
<unk>, if all <unk> well, that's not <unk> <unk>, it may be easily <unk> this goal.
And there are, <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And it's better if a lot of solutions are going to be successful, because at that point of <unk> solutions.
It's necessary that at least one successful success.
CA: <unk> of <unk> important, <unk>, this is the biggest you <unk>?
<unk>: A <unk> revolution is the most important thing.
And that would be <unk> without the <unk> <unk>, but the <unk> <unk> make it much more important.
In the nuclear <unk>, there are other <unk>.
We don't know their work as well like this, but one is a nuclear approach.
There's a <unk> <unk>. It seems to me difficult to do, but perhaps they tell them the same thing.
So there are different, but the nice is that a <unk> of <unk> <unk> a million times more energy than a <unk> of a <unk>, say, <unk>, <unk>, so if you can <unk> <unk> the <unk>, the potential in terms of the effects of the environment and something else, does almost <unk>.
CA: What if we don't work, what do we do?
<unk>'t we have to <unk> <unk> <unk> to try to keep the <unk> temperature?
<unk>: If you <unk> in that situation, it's a little bit like when you're too <unk>, and you're going to have a <unk> attack.
Where do we need a <unk> or something like that.
There's a whole line on <unk> <unk>, which are different <unk> that are various <unk> that <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's like a <unk> <unk>.
<unk> we don't need.
Some people say you shouldn't even work on the <unk> because you may be <unk>, you can continue to eat you.
I don't think it's an <unk> choice, view of the problem, but now in the <unk> of the <unk>, you say, if you could keep <unk> solutions in the case that <unk> events, or the <unk> <unk> <unk> later.
CA: If I had a <unk> or two to them, like <unk> <unk> who <unk>?
<unk>: Well, <unk> there are different kinds of <unk> and the ones that <unk> <unk> are very few.
Some people say there is a <unk> <unk> because of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>.
They're very, very few things that you can just say that there's a <unk> on a million <unk>. Here the main problem <unk> to AIDS.
We have a <unk> now, and I <unk> the <unk> just a lot later.
And so, when you're <unk> from a thousand <unk>, the idea to make sure that the results just after --
<unk> for <unk> not <unk> <unk>.
In fact, the relationship of <unk> <unk> <unk>; there are people in the <unk> world that looks at the <unk> and says, OK, that's not so bad.
The fact is that that <unk> should be <unk> to action.
But my dream is that if we can <unk> <unk>, and to <unk> the <unk> of CO2, then <unk> <unk>. <unk>: OK, I don't care if I don't <unk> CO2, almost <unk> that are <unk> of <unk> technologies.
CA: That would be your answer to the <unk> <unk> <unk>, that if you <unk> all your <unk> trying to solve the CO2 problem, your other <unk>, your other <unk>, will be <unk>, and that <unk> of money, when there are better things to do, it means <unk> <unk> resources.
<unk>: Well, the <unk> <unk> in <unk> and development --
We say that <unk> should <unk> 10 billion more <unk> than now is not so <unk>.
It shouldn't be <unk> resources to other <unk>.
The things that <unk> a lot of money, and there are also <unk>, are <unk> to <unk> solutions.
For me, it's <unk>.
<unk> that you're not <unk> the <unk> of <unk>, <unk> to the point where you're very <unk>, I think <unk> <unk> <unk> in technologies that have the potential to <unk> the cost.
If the <unk> was, "<unk> the <unk> energy, so that only <unk> can <unk>," all of the people can pay for the energy five times without changing life.
The <unk> would be for those two billion.
And <unk> <unk> his <unk>.
The argument now is, "Why isn't it <unk> more than <unk> and <unk>?"
For his <unk> still <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk>, but he realized that it's a <unk> group, and so it's <unk> the question of <unk> and <unk>.
And it's a question that I think is <unk> <unk>.
It's amazing how little it <unk> in <unk> and development.
CA: Well, I think, just talk about the <unk> <unk> of the public <unk> and saying that I hope to see your <unk>. Thank you.
<unk>: Thank you.
I want to share with you a discovery that I did a few months ago when I was <unk> an article for the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
I've always <unk> my <unk> <unk> <unk> at any time I had something, but I'd already finished <unk> my life, and I realized that I've never been in my life, I've been looking for the word "<unk>" <unk> "to see what I would find.
Let me show you the result.
"<unk>," <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> out of <unk>, <unk> and <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>, <unk>.
I had to <unk> this list of high voice to a friend and at the beginning, he was so <unk>, but I just <unk> the word <unk> my voice was <unk>, and I had <unk> for <unk> from the <unk> and the impact that the <unk> of these words <unk> me.
You know, we're talking about the old <unk> of <unk>.
I'm thinking, will be an old <unk>, right.
But, in fact, the <unk> of <unk> was the early '<unk>.
when I was <unk> the <unk> schools, and I was <unk> and <unk> what I was coming out of my family and things <unk> to other children and the world around me.
and, <unk> <unk>, because of God I wasn't using the <unk> of <unk> at that time.
I mean, from this <unk>, it seems to be <unk> in a world that you can see somebody like me as one who has nothing <unk> in a way for them, when, today, today, are <unk> for the opportunity and the <unk> that my life has <unk>.
So, I immediately went to see the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>, <unk> to find a <unk> without value.
This is the <unk> version of <unk>.
<unk>, it's not much better.
I find <unk> two words under "<unk>" <unk> "particularly <unk>," and "<unk>." So, it's not just <unk> the words.
that's what we believe about people when we <unk> them with these words.
It's about the values behind these words, and how we <unk> them.
Our <unk> influence our <unk> to think and our view of the world and how we see other people.
In fact, a lot of <unk> civilization, <unk> that <unk> and that <unk> <unk> was more powerful, because to say things at high voice.
So, what do we want to bring to <unk>, one person who is <unk>, or a greater person with greater?
So, we were doing something simple as <unk> a person, a child, we could <unk> some <unk> and <unk> of the <unk> of their <unk>.
<unk>'t <unk> instead of <unk> for them?
One person, who opened me, was the <unk>, was the <unk> of <unk>, I was the <unk> girl in <unk>, <unk>.
His name is <unk> <unk>.
<unk>, whose name, <unk>, was too hard to <unk> for most Americans, so it became <unk>.
And the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and he had a <unk> <unk> to work with children.
<unk> anything about the time I've spent in the hospital, with the <unk> of <unk>.
I had to do what I was <unk> to <unk> with these <unk> <unk> <unk>, in different colors, you know, in different colors, you know, to try to build the legs.
And I <unk> these <unk> more than anything.
I <unk> them, I <unk> them, really <unk>.
And, you know, I knew already <unk>, like a five years, with the <unk> <unk> to try to <unk> from these <unk>, <unk>.
And, one day, he came to one of my <unk> <unk> and <unk>, these <unk>.
And he said to me, "<unk>, <unk>, you're a <unk> child, I think you can <unk> one of those <unk>.
"When the <unk>, you <unk> 100 dollars."
Now, of course, it was just a little <unk> of the <unk> <unk> that I didn't want to do in front of the perspective of being the second plan, but, what he did, was to give a different <unk>.
and <unk> in an interesting experience for me.
And I <unk> today, the <unk> of her vision, and his <unk> about me as a young girl, has <unk> my view of myself in a <unk>, <unk> and <unk> person to the future.
This is an example of how adults with <unk> of power can <unk> the <unk> of a child.
But, in the example, with those <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, our language, we don't from <unk> to <unk> to the reality that everybody <unk>, the possibility of a <unk> to see itself as a <unk>.
Our language is not <unk> to the changes of our society, many of which have been <unk> by <unk>.
<unk>, of course, from a <unk> perspective, my <unk> to <unk> <unk>, <unk> of <unk> and also <unk> to <unk> <unk> that are <unk> people to <unk> with their <unk>, and also <unk> to <unk> <unk> that nature has <unk>, without <unk> the <unk> of the <unk>, <unk> to the people of <unk>, <unk> their own <unk> of <unk>, <unk> to people, <unk> their own <unk>, <unk> to <unk> their own <unk>,
So, perhaps the <unk> <unk> technology now more <unk> what's always been a truth, that everybody has something <unk> and <unk> to our society, and the human ability to <unk> is our greatest quality.
The human ability to <unk>, is something interesting, because people always wanted to <unk> <unk> and I have to tell you that.
I've never been good, and I've been <unk> in <unk> to answer people to this, and I think I'm starting to understand why.
it's <unk> in this <unk>, <unk> <unk>, is the idea that success, or happiness, is <unk> on the other side of a challenge without <unk> or <unk> of this experience, if my success in life, if my success in life has come from an <unk>, or what people <unk> like my <unk>.
But, in fact, we're <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, by a challenge, <unk> or <unk> or <unk> or both.
And I <unk> <unk> that is a good thing.
The <unk> is not a <unk> that we have to <unk> our life.
It's part of our life.
And I think that's like my <unk>.
Sometimes it <unk> a lot, and the sometimes almost nothing, but it's always with me.
And, of course, we don't <unk> to <unk> the impact, the weight of the <unk> of a person.
There are the <unk> and the challenges in life, and it's all true and <unk> to every single person, but the question is not if you're <unk> <unk> or not, but as the <unk> to <unk>.
So, our responsibility is not simply <unk> people to us from <unk>, but <unk> to <unk> the right way.
And we do a damage to our children when we make them feel that they're not ready to <unk>.
There's an important difference and <unk> between the medical <unk> of being a <unk> person and the <unk> of the society that <unk> me or not.
And, actually, the only <unk> <unk> that I had to face is if the world has ever thought I could be <unk> by those words.
In our <unk> <unk> to <unk> those who <unk> a <unk>, <unk> truth on their <unk> <unk>, or, really, the <unk> of their <unk> life, we have to be <unk> to be <unk>.
Maybe the <unk> model of looking just at what's <unk> in you and how to <unk> place, can <unk> more the <unk> that the disease itself.
In fact, we don't have a person in the <unk>, not to understand its <unk>. We're creating another <unk> <unk> disease that already have.
We're actually <unk> a <unk> to the value of a person in our community.
So we have to see through the disease and within the <unk> of human <unk>.
and, much more important, there is a relationship between those <unk> <unk> and our <unk> creativity.
So, it's not about <unk>, or <unk>, these <unk> <unk> as something that we want to <unk> or <unk> under the <unk>, but rather find those opportunities in a <unk>.
So, perhaps the idea I want to explain is that there's not what's like an <unk>, like <unk> to it, <unk> <unk>, to use a term of <unk> <unk>, maybe even <unk> together.
And, perhaps, if we look at a <unk> as a natural and useful, we're less <unk> by his <unk>.
A few years ago, the <unk> <unk> of Charles <unk>, and it was <unk> years ago, when <unk> on evolution, which <unk> has <unk>, I think, the truth of the human <unk>.
To <unk> it in another way, it's not the <unk> of the <unk> that <unk>, and it's not even the <unk> of the <unk> that the most of changes.
<unk> is the <unk> of <unk>.
<unk> work of <unk>, between the other things, we can recognize that human ability to survive and <unk> is <unk> by the <unk> of the human spirit through the <unk> in <unk>.
So, again, <unk>, <unk>, is our greatest quality.
And, perhaps, <unk> we're not <unk> at <unk>, we don't know what we are.
Maybe this is what gives us the <unk>, a sense of <unk>, a sense of your <unk>.
So, we can make a <unk>.
we can, <unk> <unk> as something more difficult than the time.
Maybe we can see it as a <unk>.
<unk> is a <unk> that we're not <unk> yet.
I think the greatest <unk> that we have <unk> is this idea of <unk>. Now, who is normal?
There is no normal. There's a common <unk>, there is no normal.
And they <unk> those <unk> people <unk> if they <unk>?
I don't think that.
If you take this <unk> from one of how to get the <unk> to one of how to get the <unk> to one on how to get the <unk>, we can understand the force so many children, and we can understand their <unk> with the community.
<unk> <unk> us that what we, as humans, we've always wanted for the members of our community is to be help, to be able to <unk>.
There's a <unk> that in <unk>, 60 <unk> years ago, <unk> to the <unk> and the <unk> with <unk> <unk>, and, perhaps because of the experience and the <unk> of these people were <unk> <unk> value of the <unk> community. It didn't <unk> this people like <unk> or <unk> <unk>; they were <unk> and value.
This year ago, I was in a <unk> market where I came in in that <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk>.
and I was <unk> in front of a <unk> <unk>.
It was summer and I had <unk> <unk> <unk>.
I heard this guy, his voice behind me say, "but, it's not <unk> <unk>." And I <unk>, and there's this man of age. I had no idea of who was.
And I said, "<unk> <unk>, do you know? I don't remember <unk>." He said, "But," I don't <unk> you to <unk>.
Well, you know, when we got <unk> from your <unk> of your mother. "
Oh, that guy.
And, of course, but, in fact, I <unk> a <unk>.
That <unk> was the <unk> <unk>, a man that I had only known from the stories of my mother on that day, because, clear, <unk>, I was <unk> in <unk> of two weeks.
And so, the <unk> <unk> of my mother went to <unk>, so the man who <unk> me was a <unk> <unk> for my parents.
And, <unk> I had <unk> without the <unk>, and I had <unk> <unk>, some <unk> in this foot, and some in that, he had to be the <unk>, this <unk> had to be the bad news.
He said, "I had to give this <unk> to your parents that you'd never <unk>, and that never had the kind of <unk> that they have other children or no <unk> life, and you gave me the kind of <unk>, and you gave me the <unk> of the <unk>. And the amazing thing is he said to me that he <unk> in <unk> in my entire school, which I won't <unk> in my <unk> school,
I had <unk> with the <unk> <unk>, you know, the <unk> of <unk>, which I won my <unk> <unk>, or all my <unk> <unk>, and I <unk> them, <unk> to the students of his course, medicine of <unk> and <unk>.
And he called this part of the course, the <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> can be <unk> of how much <unk> can be and how <unk> it is in a person's life.
And the <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and said, "My experience, unless you're told them, and even if it comes to a <unk> <unk>, if it comes to the same, a child comes to us."
So you see the <unk> <unk> changed his <unk>.
He realized that there is a difference between a <unk> <unk> and what everybody can do with it.
And there's been a change in my thinking about the years, if you ask me when I was 15 years old, if I was 15 years, if I had <unk> <unk> with my legs in <unk> and <unk>, I would not have <unk> a second.
<unk> that kind of <unk> at that time.
If I <unk> it today, they're not <unk>.
And it's because of the experiences I had with them, not to <unk> the experiences that I had with them.
and, perhaps, the change in me, because I've been <unk> more to people who <unk> me.
You see, all you need is a person who <unk> you <unk> the <unk> of your <unk>, and you're <unk>. If you can give somebody the <unk> of their <unk> force, the human spirit is so <unk>, if you can do it, and you <unk> a <unk> moment, you're <unk> it in the best ways.
You're <unk> to <unk> their own <unk>.
in fact, the <unk> meaning of the <unk> word is from <unk> "<unk>" which means, <unk> out what's inside, to bring the potential.
So, again, what is the potential we want to <unk> out?
There was a <unk> <unk> in the '<unk> in <unk> <unk>, when they were <unk> by schools.
It's called the "<unk>" <unk> "<unk>" in <unk> "here in the <unk>."
It means <unk> students from their <unk> from their <unk>.
And the students with the best <unk> have a <unk> program, and better teachers, <unk>, <unk>, they did it for a period of three months, <unk> students with <unk> <unk> <unk> gave "<unk>." They said they were <unk>, who said they were <unk>, who were smart.
And at the end of this period of three months, were <unk> to the <unk> level.
I thought they were in school, beyond the ones that I had left.
The <unk> part of this study was that the teachers had been <unk>.
The teachers didn't know that had been done this change.
<unk> was saying, these are the students from <unk>, and these are the ones with <unk>.
And so it's how they started <unk>.
So, I think the real <unk> is to have a <unk> spirit, and a <unk> <unk> has no hope.
You can't see the beauty.
It has no longer our natural <unk>, <unk> <unk> and our ability to imagine.
if, we can support the human spirit to <unk> the hope, to see the beauty in itself and others, to be <unk> and <unk>, <unk>, <unk> that we're using our <unk> force.
When the spirit spirit has these <unk>, we can create new reality and new ways of being.
I'd like to leave you with a <unk> <unk> from a <unk> <unk> called me to know my friend <unk> <unk>.
and the <unk> is called, "The <unk> that <unk> only four words," Every child has met God, not the <unk> of the <unk>, not the <unk> of the <unk>, but the God who only four words and <unk> <unk>, and say, "<unk> with me."
Thank you.
