<unk> year I showed these <unk> for <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk>, which is almost three million years had the size of the United States <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk> 40 percent.
<unk> this <unk> <unk> of the problem because it doesn't show the ice <unk>.
<unk> <unk> is, in a certain sense, the heart of the <unk> of climate system.
They <unk> <unk> and <unk>.
The next <unk> is a <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of the last 25 years.
<unk> <unk> are <unk> in red.
As you see, you're <unk> to the blue <unk>.
That's the ice in <unk>, which is <unk>.
You can see that the <unk> ice <unk>, of five years or more, it's like the blood, that there is <unk> by the body.
<unk> years, it's been so, in 25 years, so.
This is a problem because the <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> around the ocean <unk> where there are huge amount of <unk> <unk> that, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>,
<unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, that <unk> <unk> <unk>, that <unk> <unk>, <unk> this point of not <unk>.
In some <unk> <unk> <unk> is already <unk> by water.
The <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>! <unk>: <unk>! <unk>: She's good. The question is if we're also going to be.
One is that this <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk>.
This is a <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> never <unk> <unk>.
This is the <unk> <unk>, in the <unk> of <unk>.
If you want to know how the <unk> level of the <unk> <unk> on <unk>, here is where the sea.
These <unk> are <unk>.
<unk> on the planet: <unk>, the biggest <unk> of the planet.
<unk> month, <unk> scientists that the <unk> of ice is <unk>, and that the Western <unk>, which <unk> on some <unk> <unk>, is particularly <unk> in <unk>.
<unk> at <unk> feet of the <unk>, as in <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, the most <unk> of ice, you see new <unk>, which is that a few years ago, they were <unk>.
<unk> percent of the world population <unk> <unk> water from that <unk>.
<unk> <unk>: This <unk> is the source of water <unk> of this city.
The <unk> is <unk>.
But when you get it, the same happens to the water.
In California <unk> <unk> <unk> is <unk> of 40 percent.
<unk> <unk> are in the crisis.
<unk>, as you read, they're <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> in the world to a <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> are <unk> to a normal <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> times over the last 30 years than the <unk> <unk>.
This is a <unk> of all <unk>.
If you look in the <unk> context, you can see the <unk>.
In the last five years, we've been <unk> 70 million <unk> -- 25 million <unk> in the ocean every day.
Look at the <unk> area, from <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and on both parts of the <unk> <unk>, where there's a <unk> <unk> of oxygen in the oceans.
The biggest <unk> of global warming, together to <unk>, which is 20 percent, is the use of <unk> <unk>.
<unk> is a problem, and <unk> is even worse worse than it.
The United States is one of the two countries with the most emissions, together.
And it <unk> to build a lot of other <unk> <unk>.
But we're <unk> to a <unk> of the direction.
These are the <unk> projects in the last few years and some <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
At every way, there's a <unk> politics in our country.
The <unk> of <unk> and oil <unk> <unk> million dollars in the last year to <unk> <unk> <unk>, which is a <unk>.
<unk> image me <unk> something --
<unk> <unk>, in <unk>, where I live, there was a <unk> of <unk> billion <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
You've seen it on the <unk>.
This is the second largest flow of <unk> in America.
It's success around <unk>.
The <unk> of one of the <unk> <unk> was this.
<unk>: <unk> â™« <unk> the <unk> is a <unk> <unk> and happy.
It's <unk> here in America, and <unk> our economy.
<unk> the <unk> is <unk>.
It's good price, <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk>: At the <unk> is a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The biggest society <unk> <unk> is <unk>. This is his <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> <unk>: <unk> <unk> -- Al <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> -- don't know what they're talking about.
<unk>: So, <unk> for the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This is one of them, a part.
<unk>: <unk>: <unk>, we see the <unk> changes as a <unk> <unk> to our business.
For this <unk> is <unk> a big amount of money in a <unk> <unk> for <unk> to make public <unk> and <unk> the truth on <unk>.
It's actually, <unk> is not <unk>.
We think it's <unk> -- it's also a good <unk>.
So, we don't know about climate change.
We're going to do it.
<unk>: <unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk> -- you've heard a lot of it.
So I <unk> a <unk> structure of <unk> as <unk>.
<unk>! The machines are a little bit of <unk>, but that's the sound of <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> is between the main <unk> of global <unk>, but the <unk> technology of <unk> that you see it everything.
Let's look: this is the <unk> technology of <unk> <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to the economic issue and the national security.

The <unk> that <unk> all: our <unk> <unk> <unk>, like <unk> <unk> and oil <unk>.
But, there's a new, <unk> solution for <unk>.

A plan for <unk> America to work, <unk> more <unk>, and to help <unk> <unk> global warming.

<unk>: A old <unk> <unk> says, "If you want to go to <unk>, go from alone.
If you want to go away, you go. "
We have to go far, quickly.
Thank you very much.
<unk> year, I did a <unk> on <unk>.
And I'm going to <unk> about how the machine works.
So there. And for those who was not, the other time there were, the <unk> is the largest scientific experiment ever <unk> -- <unk> miles of <unk>.
His job is to <unk> the conditions that were <unk> less than a <unk> of the universe -- until <unk> million times a second of universe -- until <unk> million times a second.
That's just <unk>.
This is the machine under <unk>.
<unk> these <unk> <unk> inside the <unk>.
This is what I work. It's called <unk>. It's <unk> feet and it's a <unk> of <unk>.
This is a <unk> image of <unk> in building so you can see the <unk>.
<unk> <unk> year, we <unk> the machine for the first time.
And this picture was <unk> by <unk>.
It was because of <unk> <unk> <unk> in control.
It's a first picture of the first <unk> of particles that had been <unk> around <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and <unk> particles in the <unk>.
In other words, when you <unk> that image the 10 <unk>, <unk> that the machine, which is a great <unk>.
I don't know if it was this to <unk> more or this, when somebody <unk> on Google and <unk> that the <unk> page was this.
What means we've had a <unk> impact beyond the scientific <unk>.
<unk> a week later, there was a problem with the machine, it had to <unk> here -- these <unk> <unk>.
These <unk> <unk> <unk> when the machine works at the <unk> of <unk>.
Now, <unk> between you <unk> the <unk> and <unk>, "It's not true. It's not true. It's too <unk>."
And instead they can do it because when they're very <unk> <unk> <unk>.
So, <unk> degrees, at least <unk> degrees, at the <unk> of the space between the stars, these <unk> can bring that <unk>.
In one of the <unk> of the most <unk> <unk> in the <unk>, there was a <unk> of <unk>.
So <unk> <unk> <unk>, and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This was the result.
Now, this is even more <unk> if you think that these <unk> <unk> <unk> more than 20 <unk>, and that's <unk> about 30 <unk>.
They <unk> about 50 <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, what we did.
We <unk> them and <unk>.
They're now <unk> everybody at their <unk>.
<unk> the end of <unk> the <unk> is going to be new <unk>.
The <unk>, and we're going to get <unk> data to <unk> or <unk>, and keep our <unk> to discover what are the <unk> that <unk> the universe.
Now, of course, in a certain way, these <unk> <unk> the <unk> of science and engineering <unk>. It's easy to <unk>. It's easy to <unk>.
I think the fact that it's so hard, the fact of going to beyond <unk>, I think it's this value of things like <unk>.
I want to <unk> with the words of a <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, which, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, he said, "No," <unk> is so <unk> for the progress of human mind as the <unk> of human mind as <unk> as the ideas of science as <unk> as the <unk> that are <unk>, and <unk>, that are not <unk>, and <unk>,
Thank you.
I want to start <unk> to <unk> when, from children, <unk> <unk>.
<unk> as <unk> and <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, actually thinking and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> to the way that we <unk> a lot of the world around us.
So, from <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of our <unk> with <unk> objects, and I <unk> to my <unk> <unk>, and my <unk> <unk> <unk>, and I started <unk>, "And if we use a computer, instead of having the only <unk> of <unk> as digital <unk> that will <unk> <unk> <unk> on a <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. <unk>.
and <unk> to our <unk>?
The question was so interesting that we were to explore the answer, building the <unk>.
In a few words, a <unk> is a computer <unk> as a <unk>.
In a few words, a <unk> is a computer <unk> as a <unk>.
You can <unk> them with the hand, they can <unk> them, and they're going to hear their <unk> and a screen and a radio <unk>.
But <unk>, they're <unk>, like <unk>, you can just <unk>.
The <unk> is the example of a new <unk> of tools to <unk> information.
And as as the <unk> that they become more <unk>, <unk> of the other, and as they get more <unk>, <unk> of the right movement, other, as we can <unk>, we can explore new <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
<unk> with some simple example.
This <unk> is <unk> to show you about the video: if you <unk> it into a direction, the <unk> <unk>, so if you're going to go back to the <unk>.
These <unk> are <unk> of others.
If you <unk> them, you're going to see what's around.
If they're <unk>, you can <unk> it and they can <unk> a little bit.
If they're <unk>, you can <unk> it and they can <unk> a little bit.
They also <unk> their movement and <unk>.
We've been <unk> that one of the interesting <unk> of the <unk> <unk> was the <unk> that we use <unk> <unk> in the data, <unk> <unk>.
In this case, we have three <unk> <unk> as a <unk> <unk> of <unk> and I can <unk> for <unk> of color in the central, where it's <unk>.
and I can <unk> for <unk> color in the central color, where they're <unk>.
And we can <unk> too, we can <unk> a little bit of place.
There's also <unk> possibilities of <unk>, as <unk>, <unk>, mathematics and games of <unk> where people can try and <unk> things where people can try things, and they <unk> the results immediately.
I'm now --
This is a <unk> <unk> that I'm going to <unk> with a <unk> program.
And here we have a words that is in half <unk> and <unk>.
<unk>, every <unk> <unk> a letter to <unk> a letter on every <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> a letter on every <unk>, and as <unk> of <unk> words, he <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Then, after about 30 seconds, you're <unk>, and you have a new chance of <unk> and new possibilities to try.
Thank you.
Here's the children <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk>, I did in a way that <unk> them and <unk> a video.
They're very <unk>.
And one of the interesting things of <unk> is that you don't have to give people a lot of <unk>.
I just say, "<unk> of words," and they know what to do.
Here's other people who are <unk>.
This is our <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, there.
It was actually going to <unk>.
They were just <unk>, for him.
Now, this is a <unk> of a <unk> <unk>.
<unk> building a <unk> for the <unk> of the <unk>. He's <unk>.
It can <unk> new characters in the scene, <unk> their <unk>.
It can <unk> new characters in the scene, <unk> their <unk>.
Here, it's, it's doing the sun.
<unk>: The sun is <unk>.
David <unk>: Now, it's a <unk> in the scene.
<unk>: The <unk> <unk>.
<unk> work! <unk>!
So <unk> the <unk> and <unk> can <unk> the characters --
<unk>: <unk>!
<unk> your story.
<unk>: <unk>!
<unk>: It's a story with the final <unk>, and it can decide how to <unk>.
<unk>: It's a story with the final <unk>, and it can decide how to <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>, <unk>.
<unk>: The last example that I've been the time to show you a <unk>, <unk> and <unk> music.
It's a tool, made of a <unk>, <unk> and <unk> music.
The <unk> here is <unk> as the base, <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> of these have four different <unk>, and you can choose what to use.
You can also <unk> these <unk> in a <unk> <unk>.
And I just <unk> a sound <unk> and a <unk>.
These are actually that you can control from the live, like <unk> and <unk>.
The <unk> to a particular sound and then <unk> for <unk>.
And then there are the effects of time and <unk>, which is <unk> to the entire sequence.
<unk> like it works.
<unk>: <unk>: <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk>, "<unk> <unk> <unk>," <unk> in a series, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
Now, let's <unk> a <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>: <unk> of the <unk> --
<unk>: <unk>: And now I'm going to <unk> the <unk> to the <unk>, so I can control the effect of the live.
<unk>: <unk>: I can <unk> the entire <unk> <unk> the time on one side or from one.
<unk>: <unk>: And now we're going to <unk> the bottom for <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>: I can <unk> the sequence of the flight.
So I don't have to <unk> before, but I can <unk>, <unk> more or more <unk>.
And now, finally, I can <unk> the entire <unk> <unk> on the left the <unk> <unk>.
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is to build new <unk> <unk> <unk> to how they work work and body.
And today, I've been time to show you one of this <unk>, and also some chance that we try to bring out of the lab.
The concept I want to <unk> is that it's <unk> this new generation of <unk> objects for <unk> with the media, which is <unk> information in our world in the way we want.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the time to talk with all of you.
They're a <unk>.
<unk> books is my <unk>, but it's more than this, of course.
It's also love and <unk> of my life.
And I don't look like that.
But, he said, something particular is happened in my life and in my life, and in my career, which has <unk> me to <unk> the whole relationship with this job.
The particular thing is I <unk> written this book, this <unk> called "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> from my books, for some reason <unk> in the world and <unk> a big <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
And the result is that it <unk> everywhere, people <unk> me as if I was <unk>.
<unk> -- <unk>, <unk>!
I'm going to <unk> me, and they say, "You don't have fear of not being able to do better?
You don't have fear to write for all the life without able to create a book that could <unk> to someone? "
that can <unk> to someone? "
It's <unk>, you know.
But it could be worse, in the one of the <unk> of 20 years ago, when I was saying to people -- I was a <unk> -- I wanted to be a <unk>.
<unk> to the same <unk> <unk>.
And people said, "Don't <unk> to be able to be successful?
You don't have fear <unk> you?
You don't have fear to do this <unk> for all life without anything going to be <unk> and die on a <unk> of <unk> <unk>? "
So, you know.
The answer -- the short response to all these questions is, "Yes."
I'm afraid of all those things.
I've always been fear.
And I also fear of a lot of other things that people could not <unk>.
How <unk> and other things <unk>.
But, as much about the writing what I thought and I thought I was <unk> <unk> is why?
Is it <unk>?
It's <unk> that anybody who <unk> <unk> to be <unk> by a job that you feel born for doing.
But what's so particular in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on the health <unk> <unk> in a way that other <unk> do not doing?
How did my father, for example, he was a <unk> <unk> and I don't remember one time in her 40 years of activity in which he was asked if she she was asked to be <unk>?
It never was there -- that <unk> of the <unk> John, how does it?
<unk>'t it, <unk>?
<unk>, <unk> engineers like a group don't have, in <unk>, <unk> the <unk> of being <unk> <unk>.
We <unk>, we have enough this <unk>, and not only <unk>, but <unk> of all kinds of <unk> <unk>.
And they don't know, the <unk> of the dead <unk> <unk> <unk> that, only in the <unk> century, young and often, for them, young people and often hand.
And even those who don't seem to be <unk> by their <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, before he died, in the last <unk> said, "Every book my book <unk> me a little bit more <unk> about the work of their lives.
But we don't <unk> when we've heard these things so long long as we've been so long as we have completely <unk> and <unk> the <unk> that creativity and <unk> are in some way to <unk> and that art, at the end, <unk>, always <unk> to <unk>.
And the question I want to <unk> all here today, is, you know, I'm <unk> with this idea?
It's good for you -- because it's also <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk> by me, it's not good for this <unk>.
I think it's <unk>.
And I think it's also <unk> and I don't want to <unk> <unk> in the next century.
I think it's better <unk> our big <unk> to live.
And I certainly know that, in my case -- it's very <unk> to start <unk> to <unk> to <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in which I'm in my career.
<unk> -- <unk> -- look, I'm pretty young, I have about 40 years.
I still have about four <unk> of work in me.
And it's very <unk> that everything is going to happen now in the world as the work that <unk> after <unk> <unk> success of my last book.
<unk> <unk>, because we're all <unk> or less friends here -- it's <unk> that my biggest success is to my <unk>.
Oh, <unk>, who thought!
You know this is the kind of thinking about <unk> <unk> at nine of the morning and I don't want to do it.
I'm going to continue to do this work that I love.
So, the question becomes, how?
And so I think, after many <unk>, that the way to work to write is to create a <unk> <unk>, OK?
I have to a few <unk> from <unk>, which I'm <unk>, and my natural <unk> on what I'm going to get out, and as I was <unk> for all last year, as we're going to <unk> to look at the time, looking at the time, looking at the time, looking at the time, and I'm going to be <unk> ideas and <unk> ideas to see if you're going to be <unk> ideas.
about how to help people <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity.
And that research <unk> me to the <unk> <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> because I went back to <unk> and then <unk> back.
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> -- people don't believe that creativity <unk> by men, OK?
They <unk> that creativity was this <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> to the men from a few <unk> <unk> and <unk>, for <unk> and <unk>, for reasons and <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> <unk> of these <unk> <unk> of creativity.
<unk>, <unk>, <unk> of having a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> were the same idea, but they <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk>.
which is <unk>, because <unk> don't really <unk> that a <unk> was somebody smart.
<unk> that a <unk> was this kind of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> literally in the <unk> of a artist, a little artist, a little bit of like <unk>, and that <unk> out of <unk> the <unk> of <unk> the artist and <unk> the result of that work.
<unk> <unk> <unk>. This is the distance of what I'm talking about that <unk> you from the results of your work.
And everybody <unk> that was so that they were like, right?
So, artists were <unk> by <unk> things, like, for example, too <unk>, no?
If your work work was <unk>, you don't <unk> all the <unk>, everybody <unk> that <unk> state of this <unk> <unk>.
If your work work <unk>, it wasn't all <unk>, right?
Everybody <unk> that was your <unk> to be a <unk>.
And so people <unk> <unk> creativity in <unk> for a long time.
Then the <unk> <unk> and all <unk>, and <unk> this big idea; we put the human being at the center of the universe above all of the universe over the <unk> <unk>.
This was the <unk> principle of <unk> and people <unk> to think about the creativity <unk> completely from <unk>.
And for the first time in history, it <unk> to this or that artist as a rather <unk> to a <unk> <unk>.
And I have to <unk>, I think it was a big <unk>.
I think I'm going to <unk> to be like a <unk> as a source, as a source, <unk> and <unk> of all <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, <unk> and <unk> is a responsibility for a <unk> <unk> to <unk> human <unk>.
It's like to ask someone of the sun.
<unk> and <unk> completely <unk> and <unk> the <unk> and makes all these <unk> <unk> on the <unk>.
And I think it was this pressure to have <unk> artists in <unk> 500 years.
And, if this is true, and I think it's, the question becomes, and now?
Can we do it?
They go back to a <unk> understanding of the relationship between human relationship between human relationship and <unk>.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we can't <unk> 500 years of thinking in a 18 minutes.
And there's probably people in the audience that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on their <unk>, <unk>, you know, <unk> people <unk> <unk> of <unk> on their projects.
You probably don't tell you about this thing.
But the question I'd like to <unk> is -- why not?
Why don't we do it in this way?
Because it's more than anything that ever ever heard about to explain the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> process.
One process, as everybody has ever <unk> to do something -- so basically, everybody -- so, everybody -- know, you don't know.
And, in fact, it can be completely <unk>.
I did this <unk> <unk> <unk>, who has now 90 years, which now, but that was a <unk> for the whole life and said that during his <unk> <unk>, <unk> out of the <unk> <unk>, <unk> out in the field, <unk> out of the <unk>. And he was a <unk> <unk> from the <unk>.
He said he was like a a <unk> <unk>.
And that <unk> <unk> to her from <unk>.
The <unk> <unk>, because he was <unk> the ground under his feet.
I decided to have one thing to do to that point and was, words, "<unk> as a <unk>."
And so he <unk> up to the home and he was <unk> by this <unk>, and it wouldn't have to <unk> that take a piece of paper and a <unk> enough <unk>, and <unk> on the page.
<unk> times, they don't get enough, so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> without being able to get to the home and <unk> through the <unk> and she would <unk> through the <unk>, looking for, as she said, "another <unk>."
And then there were those times -- this piece never <unk> it -- there were moments of moments that was almost <unk>, OK?
So, he was <unk> home and he was looking at home and <unk> the <unk> through, and he <unk> a <unk> right in the <unk> that was <unk>, and then he said, he was, and he was that he was <unk> with the other hand and <unk>.
<unk> the <unk> of the tail and the <unk> in her body and <unk> on the page.
And in these cases, the <unk> would be <unk> on the <unk> page and <unk>, but at the last word to the first.
So when <unk> <unk> <unk> -- it's exactly <unk> to my <unk> process.
Not all my <unk> process -- I'm not a <unk>!
I'm a <unk>, and my way of <unk> is; it's <unk> at the same <unk> every day and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> over <unk>.
But even I even, in my <unk>, I <unk> against that what I was <unk> against that what I was sometimes.
And I think a lot of you the <unk> <unk>.
You know, even if the work and ideas <unk> me to a certain source, I couldn't <unk> <unk>.
And what is this thing?
And how can we <unk> it to do not <unk> your head, but rather, what is it, that's pretty, that's going to do it?
For how much I'm about, the best example that I have is the <unk> <unk> <unk>, which I've been <unk> several years ago for a <unk>.
<unk> of this, and you know, <unk>, for the <unk> of life was the <unk> of <unk> artist <unk>, <unk>, <unk> these species of <unk> <unk> <unk>.
But then <unk>, <unk>, and a day as it was <unk> on a <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> everything for him.
<unk>, <unk> and all of a <unk> <unk>, that comes into his head as a <unk>, <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, but it doesn't know how to <unk>.
It doesn't have a piece of paper, it doesn't have a <unk>.
So, it starts to hear this kind of old <unk> <unk> in him, "I'm going to <unk>, and <unk> from this <unk> song.
I'm not pretty <unk> and I can't <unk>. "
And instead of going to go into the <unk>, they're <unk>.
<unk> the whole <unk> process and made something completely new.
He just <unk> the sky and said, "<unk>, you see I'm <unk>?"
"Do you think it's going to write a song now?
If you really want to <unk>, you're going to be a more <unk> when I can care care about you.
<unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk>. "
And his <unk> process, <unk> <unk> after this.
Not the work, the work was still <unk> as always.
But the process, and the <unk> <unk> that was <unk> when <unk> the <unk>, the <unk> that <unk> was <unk> when <unk>, the <unk> that <unk> out of him <unk> that had not to be a <unk> and <unk> it back from where, <unk> was <unk> that it wasn't going to be a <unk> and <unk>.
but I <unk> this <unk>, wonderful <unk> <unk> a conversation between <unk> and this <unk> and <unk> that <unk> and <unk> that it wasn't <unk>.
So how I <unk> that story is to change a little bit of the way I'm going to be able to do it.
This idea, I was <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and I'm going to <unk>, and we're not going to do it and we're not going to do it and we're not going to do it, and we're going to be the <unk> book.
Not only <unk>, right, right, right, right, right, not only <unk>, right the book.
And I started to think about <unk> this project.
But then I <unk> to <unk> that <unk> to the air and <unk> us.
So I <unk> my face on the <unk> and <unk> my <unk> to a <unk> <unk> of the room.
And I said to high <unk>, "<unk>, what, both of them, we know that, if this book is not going to be <unk>, no?
Because as you see, I'm <unk> everything I have, I don't have this.
So if you want it to be better, you have to <unk> and do your <unk>.
OK. But if you don't do it, you know what, I don't <unk>.
I'm going to write the same because it's my work.
And I'd like to say that it was <unk> that I'm <unk> to do my part of "because -- at the end is so, OK -- <unk>, OK -- <unk> -- <unk> in the <unk> of the moon, <unk> and <unk> music that <unk> <unk> on the <unk>, <unk> and <unk> music that <unk> <unk> on the <unk> and <unk> hours to <unk>.
And they were always <unk>, because the <unk> were <unk> and <unk>.
But every <unk>, something <unk>, and one of these <unk> artists actually <unk>.
And I know what I'm going to talk, because I know that you've seen all seen, at a certain point, a <unk> so.
It was like if the time <unk>, and the <unk> <unk> through a kind of <unk> and it wasn't doing anything else else from the <unk>, as the <unk> <unk> before, but it was all <unk>.
And suddenly, it doesn't just like a human.
But it <unk> from <unk> and under <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk>.
And when this <unk>, people <unk> what was, he was, he <unk> it with her name.
<unk> your hands and <unk> to <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, God," God, "God,"
That's God, you know.
<unk> <unk> -- when the <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> of <unk>, <unk> this <unk> with them and <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>,
In <unk>, when a <unk> <unk>, a <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> -- a <unk> of God.
And it's <unk> because we need.
But the problem comes the day after, for the <unk>, when you <unk> and <unk> that are 11 <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> God's <unk> and <unk> God is not there.
It's just a <unk> with a lot of <unk> <unk>, and maybe never <unk> to <unk> that.
And maybe nobody <unk> the name of God still as <unk>, and what's going to do with the rest of her life?
It's hard.
This is one of the most <unk> <unk> to do in a <unk> life.
But maybe not it has to be so <unk> if you're <unk> to not believe, <unk>, that the most <unk> of your being being <unk> by you.
But let me just show you data in <unk> from a <unk> source of this <unk> part of your life that you have to <unk> other when you're finished.
And, you know, if we think about this, it's all changes.
And so I started <unk>, and it's certainly like I've been <unk> for several months during the <unk> of the book that I was going to <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> of my success.
And what I have to continue to <unk> when I feel <unk> from this is, I don't feel fear.
<unk>: <unk> only your job.
<unk> to <unk> for your part, any of any can be.
If your work work is <unk>, <unk>.
If the <unk>, you're going to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> some kind of <unk>, for one moment through your <unk>, then <unk>!
<unk>, you do the same <unk>.
And "<unk>!" <unk>! "<unk>."
I think it's <unk> <unk>.
"<unk>!" <unk>! "<unk> the same, even for <unk> love and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>."
Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk>: <unk>!
As you know, I've already talked about some of these projects on the human genome, what it can <unk> and <unk> new <unk> of genes.
Now we're <unk> a new path: we started <unk> the biology and now to <unk> the biology and now <unk> in a new <unk> of biology, <unk> and <unk> and <unk> life.
We've always been trying to <unk> big questions.
"<unk> is the life?" It's something that many <unk> I think they're going to be <unk> to figure out of levels.
We tried different <unk>, <unk> to the <unk> terms.
We're <unk> from almost 20 years now.
When we <unk> the human genome <unk> to <unk> from <unk> world of biology in the digital world of the computer.
Now, we can <unk> life, or create new life from this universe?
This is the map of a little <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, which is the most small genome genome by the most small genome in the lab.
And we tried to reduce <unk> the genome for <unk> one even smaller.
We can <unk> a <unk> of genes of about 500 that are here.
But when we look at its map <unk>, it's simple than our.
<unk>, this is simple.
But when we look at all genes that we can <unk>, one at the time, it's very <unk> that this can bring a <unk> cell.
So, I thought the only way to <unk> was <unk> this <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> for <unk> some of these questions.
And so we started the <unk> of the <unk>. Can we <unk> a <unk>? "
Can the chemistry <unk> of produce these great molecules that we've never been able to create before we've ever been able to create before?
And, in case, can we make a <unk>?
A <unk> is just a piece of <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The speed with we're able to <unk> life is <unk> to <unk> <unk>.
Our ability to write the code, instead, <unk> rather slowly, but it's <unk>.
And our most <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We've been <unk> over 15 years ago.
The process has <unk> a lot of <unk>, <unk> with a <unk> <unk> before we <unk> the first experiments.
But we found that DNA is very difficult.
There are <unk> of thousands of cars in the world that <unk> little <unk> of DNA <unk>, <unk> of 30 to 50 <unk> and it is a <unk> process: the more <unk> is, more <unk> there are.
So we had to develop a new <unk> to <unk> these <unk> and <unk> the <unk>.
And this was our first <unk>, to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's a little virus that bacteria.
We designed the <unk>, we <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> a DNA <unk> of about <unk> <unk>.
The interesting part is when we took this piece of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> it in bacteria, the bacteria have <unk> to read this code and <unk> particles.
<unk> particles are <unk> by cells, they're <unk> by cells, they <unk> the <unk> <unk>.
I talked about the recent members of the <unk> industry that they've been <unk> this model.
They have more than you.
<unk> that this is a situation where the software can actually build the same <unk> in a <unk> system.
But let's do the biggest things in the time.
<unk> building the whole <unk> of <unk>.
They're more than <unk> <unk> <unk>.
So we thought of <unk> in the size of the virus, so that we can change the <unk> of a <unk> cell.
The <unk> is <unk>, and if you're <unk> with information in a computer, these are really <unk>.
When I <unk> this genome for the first time in <unk> the <unk> <unk> was a <unk> for every 10 <unk> <unk>.
We found, <unk>, 30 <unk>. If we were used that original <unk> <unk> never been able to do it.
One of the process is to design <unk> 50 <unk> that <unk> <unk> with all the other <unk> of 50 <unk> to build smaller <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> elements here.
You've probably been read that <unk> us about <unk>.
<unk> <unk>: We have a <unk> code on four <unk>: At <unk>, <unk>, <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> of those <unk> <unk> <unk> together, and there's a <unk> order for every <unk>.
So we can use the code for writing words, <unk>, <unk>.
What we did at the beginning was <unk>.
Some have been <unk> by the fact that it wasn't <unk>.
We designed these <unk> <unk> by <unk>.
There are <unk> that <unk> them and <unk> them.
And we started <unk> parts, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
In every step, we've <unk> these <unk> <unk> so that we're <unk> to create a very <unk> <unk> as you'll see in a minute.
We're trying to <unk> the process.
So, this looks like the <unk> of a <unk> <unk>.
When you start these <unk> <unk>, more than 100 <unk> <unk>, not <unk> directly in the <unk> <unk>.
You get to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> biology.
So we <unk> other <unk>.
<unk> of another <unk> called <unk> <unk>, which in biology <unk> to <unk> the DNA in <unk> <unk>.
Here's a example.
This <unk>, called <unk> <unk>, it can <unk> three million <unk> of <unk>.
You can see in the <unk> as his <unk> <unk>.
In 12 -- it's <unk> as it was before.
<unk> of thousands of organisms that are able to do it.
These organisms can <unk> completely <unk>.
We're going to live under <unk>.
They're absolutely sure that life <unk> in space, and they're <unk> to find new <unk> of water.
At fact, NASA showed that this is happening.
This is a picture of the <unk> that we've built using these <unk>, just using the <unk> design <unk>.
<unk> <unk> them.
This image was not <unk> with a <unk> <unk>, but with a <unk> <unk>.
It's a <unk> so big that we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk>.
These are pictures that <unk> a period of about six seconds.
This is the <unk> that we've done a little time ago.
They're more than <unk> <unk> code.
It's the biggest <unk> of a <unk> structure ever <unk> by the man.
It has a <unk> weight at 300 million.
If you <unk> it with a <unk> 10 without spaces, we're going to <unk> this code.
Now, how do we do it?
<unk>, through a virus is a <unk> game.
It's a little bit more <unk> when you use bacteria.
It's <unk>, even when it's about cells, as well, you can just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> another, which is basically the process of <unk>.
In <unk>, the <unk> <unk> is instead in the cell, but we <unk> <unk> that we're able to do a <unk> <unk> of a cell to another and <unk>.
We <unk> a <unk> <unk> from a kind of <unk>.
The two are the <unk> of the <unk>.
We have <unk> some <unk> in a more way that we could decide what to <unk> for this <unk>.
It's <unk> with <unk> <unk>.
And when we put it in the cell was <unk> and <unk> our <unk> the new <unk> went to the cell.
And <unk> <unk> that we didn't go beyond, but we tried to <unk> them to <unk> more in there.
This is one of the biggest <unk> of evolution.
We found that <unk> species have <unk> a second or a third <unk> from a <unk>, <unk> in a second thousands of new <unk> to that species.
So who think of evolution as a <unk> at the time, it's not <unk> of biology.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> that was in the cell, you don't have one.
The <unk> <unk> we <unk> it.
It's <unk>, and it <unk> the other <unk> as <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and we're <unk> with only the cell and the new <unk>.
It's become blue because of the genes we've <unk>.
And in a short time, all the <unk> of a time, all of a kind of <unk>, <unk> on the new software that we <unk> into the cell.
All the <unk> are <unk>, and the <unk> are <unk>, and when you <unk> the code <unk> <unk> exactly what we've <unk>.
Now, this may be <unk> <unk>, but we can <unk> the software, we can change things in a way of <unk>.
Now, I've already <unk> that there is not about <unk> -- but of progress to <unk> -- but of the progress of evolution, and a half million years and a half of evolution, and I already said that maybe we're going to <unk> new species on this process.
Why do that?
I think it's pretty <unk> when we think about our <unk>.
We're going to <unk> six and a half billion people in the next 40 years.
<unk> for a example: I was born in <unk> <unk>.
Now there are three people on the planet to <unk> in <unk>; in 40 years, there will be four.
We're <unk> problems now to find food, <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> for six billion and a half and a half of people.
I'm going to get it for nine billion.
<unk> than five billion <unk>, more than 30 billion <unk> of <unk>.
That means percent of <unk> a day.
When we try to find <unk> <unk>, or any kind of process for <unk>, it will be a huge challenge.
In the most we have to realize all the <unk> of CO2 from these materials that <unk> in the atmosphere.
At the day, in today, <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> around the world, we have a <unk> with about 20 million genes, and I like to think that are the <unk> <unk> for the future.
The <unk> industry only one <unk> about <unk>, and think about how many different things are <unk> out.
Our <unk> here are <unk> data from reality and <unk> and our imagination.
Now we have <unk>, <unk> to these <unk> <unk> <unk>, able to create what we call <unk> <unk>.
We can actually build a big robot that can produce a million <unk> a day.
Think of <unk> these 20 million different or try to try to <unk> the <unk> <unk> to produce <unk> or <unk>, new <unk>, we can change, <unk>, we can change, and create more <unk> biology now in the last 20 years of science.
And it's just a <unk> <unk>.
We can choose to <unk> the <unk>, <unk>, <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
This is a <unk> of some software <unk> that we're working for being able to <unk> and design species on the computer.
Well, we don't know how they're going to be.
We know exactly what their code is.
Now we're <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> generation.
You've seen seen <unk> from <unk> was a <unk> experiment.
We have <unk> <unk> <unk> enough as the <unk> <unk> as well as the <unk> <unk> as the <unk> or different kinds of <unk>.
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without <unk> <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the <unk> would be <unk> the CO2 in matter before, that we're working for for design cells that can achieve this purpose, and we think we can can achieve the first <unk> generation of <unk> in 18 months.
The solar light <unk> with the CO2 is a <unk>, but in our <unk> <unk> in all the world, we found different <unk>.
This is a <unk> that we <unk> in <unk>.
<unk> in the ocean, about <unk> feet of <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> by CO2 using hydrogen <unk> as a source of energy.
We're trying to figure out if we can <unk> the CO2, that can easily be <unk> by <unk>, <unk> that CO2 in <unk>, to drive this process.
So, we think about a short think we might be able to <unk> what the basic question, "which is the <unk> of" we're, we <unk> the <unk> goal of <unk> the whole industry.
<unk>. If you can't do it from TED, where you can't do it from TED, where you can't do it from TED, where you can't do it from TED, where you can't do it from TED, where you can't do it from TED, where you can't do it from TED, where you can't do it. If you can't do it from TED, where you can't do it?
<unk> a main source of energy.
And also, we're working for the same <unk> to create <unk> <unk>.
You've seen this year with flu, we're always back to a year and with a dollar in less when it's about finding the right.
I think that's what you can change, <unk> <unk>.
That's how the future might start to look <unk>, now, the tree of evolution, <unk> the evolution of bacteria, <unk>, <unk> cells.
We are so so <unk> people.
Our purpose is to do so so that we're going to live enough to try to <unk>. Thank you very much.
First of all, I'm going to show you, the most fundamental work, some of the new technology that we've <unk> to a <unk> almost a year ago. This is <unk>.
It's a environment where you can <unk> is to the local level that you can <unk> with a huge amount of data.
And here we're seeing <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with a <unk> <unk> and <unk>, for a quick <unk>, <unk> the images as we want.
And it doesn't matter how much is the amount of information that we see, how big it's <unk> of the data or <unk>.
Most of the <unk> photographs, but this is a <unk> <unk> by the <unk> of <unk>, and <unk> in the <unk> of <unk>, and <unk> in the <unk> of 300 <unk>.
It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that <unk> the <unk> of a system like this is the number of <unk> on your screen in any time. It's also a very <unk> architecture.
This is a whole book, example of data is not <unk>.
This is the <unk> <unk>. Every <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
So, for <unk> that is really about <unk> and not images, we can do something like that, to <unk>, to see that it's a real <unk> of the text, not a picture.
It could be a little bit of <unk> to read a <unk> book.
I don't tell you.
This is a <unk> example. It's a <unk> number of the <unk>.
Every image is the beginning of a <unk>.
And it really gives you the pleasure and the experience of read the real version of a <unk> or a <unk>, which is for nature a <unk> of a <unk>, which is for a <unk> kind of a <unk>.
We also did something with the corner of this particular number of the <unk> of the <unk>.
We've created a high <unk> <unk> than what you use in a normal <unk>, and we <unk> you're using it in the <unk> content.
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk>, you can see here.
Or other models, or even other models, or even the <unk> <unk>.
And this really <unk> some of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of space on the screen.
And I thought this <unk> <unk> to <unk> and other <unk> <unk>, not to be <unk>.
Of course, <unk> is one of the most <unk> <unk> for this kind of technology.
And on this, I don't want to lose time, if not to say we have <unk> <unk> from also <unk> to <unk> this.
These are all the streets in the U.S. <unk> above an image of NASA.
So now I'm going to <unk> to something else.
This is actually in the web, you can <unk> to see.
It's a project called <unk>, which <unk> two different technologies.
One is <unk> and the other is a very interesting research at the very interesting computer <unk>, a student of Washington, with the <unk> <unk> of Washington, with the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And it's alive on the web, <unk> <unk>.
You can <unk> when we do this kind of <unk>, where we can go from an image to the other and have this kind of experience to <unk> <unk>.
But the <unk> of pictures here is actually a meaning.
The <unk> of <unk> computers have these pictures together, in a way that <unk> to <unk> places where the <unk> are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> are <unk>. <unk> <unk> have been <unk>. So here you see <unk> elements of a <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk>, and these are all <unk> to <unk>.
I don't know if I've been to show you some other environment.
There's a lot more <unk>.
I want to go directly to one of the <unk> <unk> of <unk> data and this <unk> from a <unk> <unk> of <unk> that we've done for the first time, we're going to show you what it is really the key to behind this technology, technology, <unk> technology. And it's not so <unk> <unk> the <unk> that we <unk> in the website.
We've had to <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk>.
This is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> of types of <unk> and <unk> of types in <unk>, other <unk> and <unk> and <unk> of these <unk> <unk> a image that's discovery to this model.
So they're all <unk> pictures of <unk> and you're all <unk> on the <unk> level of <unk>.
And it's possible to <unk> this <unk>.
You know, I'd never thought to go to work for <unk>.
It's very <unk> <unk> this kind of <unk> here.
I think you see that it's a lot of different types of <unk>: from those phones <unk> to those <unk> <unk>, a number of <unk>, <unk> together in this environment.
And if I can, I'm going to look at those <unk> <unk>.
Many are <unk> <unk>, etc.
<unk> here is a series of photographs -- <unk>.
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We can go from the <unk> to the physics of this environment.
The <unk> point is that we can do things with social environment. This now is now <unk> data from the whole memory of the <unk> of how to <unk> the earth, from the <unk> point of view and <unk> all that data together.
All those pictures become <unk>, <unk> of the <unk>.
You have a model of the entire <unk>.
Think about this as the <unk> of the work of <unk> <unk> <unk> on Earth.
It's something that <unk> in complexity as people <unk> <unk>, and the <unk> for who who <unk> the <unk> <unk> with the use of the <unk>.
Their pictures are <unk> with <unk> <unk> by other people.
If someone's's the idea of <unk> all these <unk> <unk> the name, my picture of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of all those data, and I can use the <unk> of all those data, and I can use the pictures of <unk> in that space, using the <unk> of <unk> in that <unk>, using the <unk> of <unk>, and <unk>.
Of course, a <unk> of all of that are <unk> <unk> of every interesting part of the land, <unk> not only by <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I understood? What's your software <unk> to do is that at some point, in the next years, all the <unk> of the next years, all of the <unk> <unk> are going to be <unk> together?
<unk>: Yeah. What's doing is basically <unk>.
He's creating <unk>, if you want, between images.
And it's doing it in the base of images.
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about <unk> information information that a lot of these pictures <unk>.
As you do a <unk> of images on the web, you <unk> a <unk> and the <unk> on the page has a lot of information about the pictures of the pictures.
Now, what happens if that picture <unk> to all your picture?
So the amount of <unk> <unk> and the amount of <unk> that <unk> is really huge. It's a <unk> effect of the network.
CA: <unk>, it's really incredible. <unk>.
<unk>: I'm going to tell you a lot.
One of the main <unk> when you're <unk> and one of the <unk> research is the to be able to live in who has no <unk> <unk> <unk>, between who's the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> thinking <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, and that <unk> <unk> <unk>, or that <unk> <unk> are still <unk> of <unk>, or <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, and that the <unk> <unk> <unk>, and that the idea that the world in which we live in the <unk> of <unk>, and that the idea that the world we live in which we're not in <unk> sense, but only a <unk> of reality,
the <unk> of a particular <unk> of choices that our <unk> has done, well or bad, many <unk> does it.
And, of course, everybody <unk> <unk>.
Everybody <unk>. <unk>.
We're <unk> to <unk>.
We have to <unk> the death <unk>, so we don't <unk> it if you <unk> and <unk> --
We all have a art.
What <unk> is the particular <unk> of the song, the <unk> of <unk> every culture.
It doesn't matter that's the <unk> of the <unk>, or the <unk> of <unk>, or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, or <unk> <unk> <unk>, or a <unk> in the <unk> of <unk>.
He was my <unk> journey in the <unk> a month ago, or a <unk> of <unk> in the <unk>, on <unk>, on <unk>, the <unk> mother of the world.
All of these <unk> <unk> us that there are other ways of <unk> other ways of <unk> other ways of <unk> in the world.
And if you <unk> a second, it's a concept that can give you hope.
<unk>, the <unk> of the world create a <unk> life and <unk> that <unk> the planet, and it's important for the planet, and it's important for the planet as <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And you can think about this <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and you can <unk> the total <unk> of all <unk>, dreams, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>,
<unk> is the great <unk> of humanity.
It's the <unk> of what we are and what we can can be as as <unk> species.
And <unk> the <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> was <unk> to <unk> and <unk> much faster.
<unk> <unk>, for example, <unk> that 50 percent of all the species was or <unk>, <unk>, it's <unk>, or <unk>, or in the <unk> <unk> -- and you don't even <unk> to the <unk> -- in the <unk> diversity -- and you don't even even <unk> to the <unk> -- that's the <unk> diversity.
The <unk> of all that is, of course, <unk> <unk>.
When you're <unk> <unk> <unk> on this planet.
One language is not only <unk> by a <unk> or a series of rules <unk>.
One is the <unk> of the human spirit.
It's the middle of the <unk> of every culture comes in in the world.
Every language is a forest of the mind, a <unk>, a <unk> of <unk>.
And of those <unk> <unk>, as we're sitting here at <unk>, at least half, not it's <unk> in the <unk> of children.
They don't get <unk> to children, which means to say, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
What's more <unk> than being <unk> by the <unk>, of being the last to talk about a language, not not <unk> the <unk> of <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of the children?
This <unk> <unk> was the one of someone in the world every two weeks: every two weeks, a <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And I know that somebody of you're not better?
The world would not be a better place if we're all the same language? "<unk>, then we're talking about all. <unk> <unk>. <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>.
<unk> a <unk> thing, is, we can't talk about your language.
I'd like to give you a journey to <unk> --
a little journey in the <unk> to give you a <unk> of what we're <unk>.
Many of us <unk> that when I say, "different ways of <unk>," I mean, "I mean," I mean, a lot of us <unk>.
<unk> for example, this <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, the <unk> of <unk>, which <unk> to the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's a <unk> that's not able to <unk> the blue color from the green because the <unk> <unk> is <unk> in the forest, from which <unk> the forest that <unk>.
They have a <unk> language and a <unk> rule, <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, "You have to <unk> a person who's <unk> a different language.
And it's all <unk> in the past <unk>, but the <unk> is that in these families <unk> where they talk about six or seven <unk> because of the <unk> <unk> nobody <unk>.
They're going to listen and then you're talking about.
I <unk> one of the most interesting <unk> that I lived, the <unk> of <unk> <unk>, a incredible <unk> that had the first <unk> in <unk>.
In <unk> five <unk>, they <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
They did <unk> from the top photographs that <unk> them in <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> that this <unk> forest <unk> never seen anything.
They <unk> the pictures from the earth, they <unk> to the research of a form or a <unk> and, not <unk>, they <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk>, and they <unk> the five <unk> with <unk>.
But <unk>, not only <unk> the <unk>.
They <unk> in their own.
<unk> percent of the <unk> was <unk> by their own own.
We're <unk> to eight <unk> and found two cases of death and when we <unk> to know, they <unk> that one of them was so <unk> that one of them was so <unk> dead, and then <unk> the same. <unk>, so they had a <unk> of the forest.
The <unk> were able to recognize the animal <unk> by 40 <unk> and <unk> the species.
<unk> first years, I was a very interesting job when my <unk> <unk> <unk> me if I wanted to go to <unk> me if I wanted to to go to <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> for <unk>.
For a sense of <unk>, I should have understand the <unk> culture and that <unk> is not <unk>.
It's pretty much about a <unk> view of the world.
Very interesting.
If you're going to <unk> the great <unk> of the world, what would you <unk>?
<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, etc.
A continent is always left out, thinking about Africa has not <unk> <unk>. And instead of <unk> is not the <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk>.
What makes interesting is the <unk> relationship between life and <unk>.
So <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> can be <unk> by <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the live in the <unk> of the live in the way that for a short moment the <unk> is the <unk>.
So, this <unk> <unk> to say, "<unk> <unk>, you go to <unk> God.
We're <unk> in <unk> and <unk> God. "
And from the moment that you're <unk>, the spirit that you can get you, how can you get <unk>?
So, it <unk> to these incredible events: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a pretty strong <unk> of the power of the mind in the body, when it's <unk> in a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> all the <unk> of the <unk> that I lived the most <unk> are the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, in the <unk> <unk>.
<unk> of the <unk> civilization <unk> that once <unk> on the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
In a <unk> continent of blood, this <unk> never <unk> by <unk>.
In <unk> today, I'm <unk> by a <unk> but their education is extraordinary.
The young <unk> are <unk> from families to three or four years, and live in a world fact of <unk> and <unk> in a world fact of <unk> and <unk> <unk> to the base of <unk> for 18 years.
Two <unk> of nine years <unk> of the way to <unk> the nine months of <unk> that <unk> in the <unk> of mother, now are <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
For all this time, they're <unk> to the values of their society, values that <unk> their <unk> and only <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or for the best <unk> <unk> -- or for better <unk> <unk>.
At the term of this incredible <unk>, they're <unk> <unk> out and for the first time in their life, they see a <unk>. And in that moment of the first <unk>, when the sun <unk> <unk> <unk>, all the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, all of the <unk> <unk> <unk>, all the <unk> of his <unk>. The <unk> is a <unk> <unk>. And he says, and he says, "<unk>,
"<unk>? I said," <unk>.
It's <unk>. Now it's about you're going to be <unk>.
They call the <unk> <unk> and say that we, <unk> <unk>, we're the <unk> of the world's <unk>.
This level of <unk> is extremely important.
When we think of <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk>, and the old story of <unk> <unk>, which is a <unk> concept in his <unk>, or maybe <unk> and say that these <unk> are <unk> to the Earth.
<unk> <unk> are not <unk> <unk>.
There's no space for these things in the <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> of <unk>, but <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, but <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>, but on a <unk> <unk>, the most <unk>: the Earth can be <unk> by human <unk>.
What does it mean?
I mean that a <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> <unk> is a <unk> <unk> that <unk> is a <unk> <unk> of its <unk> will be a <unk> different <unk> and will have a different different <unk> and will have a <unk> different <unk> and it will be a <unk> of <unk> <unk> to be <unk>.
which is the <unk> of a <unk> or a <unk> <unk> is <unk>.
What's interesting is the <unk> that <unk> the relationship between the <unk> and the natural world.
I grew in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that the <unk> <unk> for being <unk>.
That <unk> me a human being different from my friends who believe that <unk> are the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> that live in the <unk> <unk> of the world, <unk> that <unk> in the <unk> <unk>.
If you start <unk> that these <unk> can actually create, different, we start to start understanding some of them <unk>. <unk> this <unk>.
I <unk> this picture in <unk> in the <unk> <unk>.
Maybe some of you've heard about <unk>, the most powerful <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk>.
What makes the <unk> is not the potential <unk> of the <unk>, but its <unk>. It's <unk> by two elements.
On one side, this <unk> <unk> that <unk> a <unk> of <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
<unk> the only <unk> <unk> a <unk> that <unk> a little bit of the <unk>, but it's <unk> with the <unk> of a family of the <unk> said <unk>.
This <unk> <unk> <unk>, very similar to the <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
If you're going to see the <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of species, <unk> has <unk> <unk>.
<unk> that <unk> on the <unk> is a little bit of like being <unk> by a <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a sea of electricity. <unk>'t make a <unk> of reality; it makes the <unk> of reality.
I often with my <unk>, Richard <unk> <unk>, the man who <unk> the <unk> was <unk>, with her discovery of <unk> <unk> in the '<unk>.
<unk>, you can't <unk> these <unk> as <unk> because if you're <unk>, you can't tell anybody of being <unk>. <unk> <unk>. <unk>, but they can't be <unk> because they're <unk> by a <unk> that <unk> <unk>, <unk>.
It's possible to <unk> only if you can <unk> with other <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk>.
Now, it's the <unk> that are in this <unk> are <unk> <unk>, of the same kind of necessary for <unk>. The question is: <unk> <unk> <unk>. The question is: in a <unk> <unk> species of plants, how these <unk> <unk> to <unk> two <unk> don't like that, but if you're going to <unk> the <unk> <unk>. The <unk> of the <unk>?
We use the great <unk> of evidence and <unk>, which can <unk> <unk>.
But if you <unk> to the <unk>, we're going to be <unk>. "
What does it mean?
This <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, which <unk> <unk> in the forest, and that to our eyes <unk> in the same species.
If the <unk> as <unk> their <unk> <unk> <unk> us, "<unk> <unk> of plants, of course, you don't know everything?" I said, "No."
The solution is: you take the <unk> <unk> in a night night of the moon <unk> with a different <unk>.
So, you don't <unk> to <unk>, but it's much more interesting than <unk> <unk>.
Now, <unk> the problem is that even those of us who have to the <unk> <unk> <unk> them are <unk>, but in some way to the <unk> of history than in our real world, and <unk> beyond.
In fact, the <unk> century, not <unk> <unk> for his <unk> or his <unk> <unk>, but rather as the <unk> was where we <unk> and <unk> <unk> the mass of the <unk> of diversity and <unk> and <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the planet. Now the problem is not the change.
All the <unk> through the <unk> have been <unk> in a <unk> for new possibilities of life.
And the problem is not technology.
<unk> <unk> have not <unk> to be <unk> when they put <unk> <unk> and <unk> as a <unk> <unk>, they don't have <unk> to be <unk> when they put <unk> <unk> and <unk>.
It's not the change or technology that <unk> the <unk> of <unk>. It's the power.
The <unk> <unk> of <unk>.
And if you <unk> a look at the world, we're <unk> that these are not <unk> to <unk>.
They're <unk> creatures and <unk> <unk> out of the <unk> forces that go beyond their ability to <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> --
a <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, a <unk> that has been <unk> for free to a generation of <unk>, and now <unk> to the <unk> and <unk> on the <unk> of <unk>, where you can see the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, which looks <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>,
<unk> to <unk> the <unk> <unk> to the forest.
Or, in the case of <unk>, it's diseases that are <unk> with the <unk> discovery of <unk>.
If you <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk>, where I'm doing a lot of research, you'll see the <unk> of politics.
As <unk> the <unk>, the physics of a <unk>, is <unk> at <unk> level, but <unk>, <unk>, the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of a <unk>, not only is it, but <unk> <unk> <unk> in certain <unk>, because it's part of <unk>.
And you can't understand the <unk> of the <unk> until you're part of the <unk>.
I <unk> the <unk> miles from <unk> in China through the <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> with a young <unk>, but only <unk> to <unk> it. I've been <unk> with what's behind.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> million people <unk> from the <unk> <unk>.
The father of this guy was <unk> to the <unk> <unk>.
which means that it's been <unk> to the Chinese <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
My mother was <unk> and her <unk> was <unk>.
It was <unk> of <unk> in <unk> at the age of two <unk> <unk> <unk> her because he couldn't have to live without him.
The <unk>, who did the same, was <unk> in <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> a day <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>, for this <unk>, was <unk> to the <unk> work for seven years.
The pain of <unk> can be <unk>, but the <unk> of the <unk> is by <unk> <unk>.
And it was <unk> to a choice.
How to live in the <unk> world of <unk> or <unk> the <unk> world of diversity?
The great <unk> <unk>, before he said that the biggest <unk> was that, in our <unk> to go to this <unk> view of the world, not only <unk> the whole whole <unk> of human imagination <unk> to a <unk> <unk> of human imagination to a <unk> <unk> that there were other possibilities.
And it's <unk> to <unk> that our species is <unk> for <unk> years.
The <unk> <unk>, which gave us agriculture, which has been doing <unk> us to the <unk> of <unk>, <unk> the <unk> of <unk>, creating the <unk> of <unk>, creating the <unk> of <unk>, and we talk about <unk> years ago.
The <unk> world <unk> <unk>.
That <unk> story, I don't know we have the answers to all the challenges that we're going to <unk> in the <unk> to come.
When these <unk> <unk> of the world's <unk>, what it means to be human, <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And it's in these answers that we all <unk> the opportunity to be what we are: a <unk> species, that has to <unk> that all <unk> and all the <unk> can <unk>. And there are great moments of <unk>.
I <unk> this picture on the <unk> <unk> of <unk>, when I went to <unk> <unk> with <unk>, and this man, <unk>, and this man, <unk> me, he <unk> the wonderful story of her <unk>.
The <unk> government was not always <unk> with the <unk> <unk> and <unk> our <unk>, in the '<unk> for <unk> our <unk>, we <unk> them in <unk>.
The <unk> of this man <unk> <unk>.
The family, <unk> for her life, <unk> all the <unk>, and all of her <unk>.
You know, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
The <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> fish in <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> of this man did not <unk> by night or <unk> from <unk>.
It's <unk>, you <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> in your hand. When I did <unk>, they <unk>, they <unk>, he <unk> it <unk>, he <unk> it <unk> a <unk>.
He <unk> <unk> <unk> on this <unk> of <unk> <unk> and when <unk> <unk>, he <unk> a dog.
He <unk> the dog and created a <unk>, with the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. It's <unk> another dog and <unk> on the <unk>, <unk> of <unk> in <unk>.
<unk> to talk about nothing? [<unk>]. That, in different ways, [<unk>] is the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and all the <unk> <unk> of the world.
<unk> <unk> the <unk> government <unk> <unk> the total <unk> of an area of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of an area of <unk> <unk>.
It's their new <unk>. It's called <unk>.
It's a <unk>. <unk> all the resources <unk>.
One <unk> example of how a <unk> can <unk> with her <unk>.
And, to end, I think it's pretty <unk> at least at least at least <unk> at least at least <unk> at all.
For someone is home.
<unk> <unk> of human imagination that <unk> to the <unk> of the times. And for us, all of our children, as the dreams of our children, become part of the hope.
For us, we're <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk>, we're <unk> that <unk> never.
<unk> that <unk> --
<unk> are not <unk>, but we believe that stories can change the world, and maybe we're the best <unk> to tell stories of the world. Every month our <unk> <unk> <unk> million <unk>.
<unk> <unk> our <unk> <unk>.
Our <unk> are <unk> by millions of people.
Our work is <unk> in <unk> to bring our public <unk> in <unk> places that <unk> <unk> from what <unk> <unk> <unk> from what they've seen and <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> for the central <unk>, the world of <unk> in diversity, and we have to find a <unk> <unk> and <unk>. We have to find a <unk> <unk> life in a world and <unk>. We have to find a <unk> world in a <unk> world.
where the <unk> of all <unk> can <unk> to our <unk> <unk>.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope you've already heard and <unk> to <unk> some <unk>, in the case, you don't <unk> them.
I want to start with what I call "the <unk> <unk> <unk>."
The <unk> <unk> of what?
The <unk> <unk> of all the society <unk> <unk> <unk>: "If we want to <unk> the <unk> of our citizens." The way to do it is <unk> the <unk> of <unk>. "
The reason is, on one side, in fact that the freedom is <unk>, <unk>, <unk> for humans.
<unk> else is in fact that if we're <unk>, each of us can act to do all of us can <unk> our <unk>, without no one that <unk> in our name.
The way to <unk> the freedom is to <unk> the choice.
<unk> people have, more choices, and more, and more, and more, it's their freedom, more than their <unk>.
This, <unk>, it's so <unk> <unk> in the society that nobody <unk> <unk> in <unk>.
And it's also <unk> <unk> in our lives.
I'm going to show you a few examples of what the progress has made possible.
This is my <unk>. It's not particularly big.
I <unk> a simple note on the <unk> for <unk>.
In my <unk>, there are <unk> <unk>, without <unk> the 10 <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> that you can buy for a huge number of <unk> in the <unk> <unk> that you can <unk> <unk> <unk> is to your <unk>.
That's what <unk> is the <unk>.
Then you go to the <unk> store for a <unk>: <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, radio, <unk>, <unk>.
And in this single <unk> store, there's a big number of <unk> <unk>.
We can make six and a half million different <unk> using the <unk> that there are a only store.
<unk> <unk> that there's <unk>.
<unk> <unk>: the world of <unk>.
Once, when I was a child, you could get all the <unk> <unk>, <unk> that were <unk> by <unk> <unk>.
They <unk> the phone, you don't <unk> it.
One <unk> of that, in the other, was that the phone never <unk>.
These are gone.
We're now a <unk> <unk> of <unk>, especially between the cell phones.
Here's the <unk> cell future.
My <unk> is in the middle, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> for <unk> <unk>.
If you don't have the <unk> in the store under the house, you're going to be sure that soon <unk>.
And what is the people <unk> to the <unk> and does this question. And you know, <unk> is the response? The answer is, "No."
It's not possible to buy a phone that doesn't <unk> things.
So, in other <unk> of life that are much more important than <unk>, <unk> the same <unk> of choices.
<unk> <unk>: It doesn't happen in the United States that you're going to be <unk> with <unk> and <unk> you what you have to do.
Instead, <unk> from <unk>, and the <unk> says, "OK, we might do it, or <unk>," <unk>, "<unk>," <unk>, "<unk> <unk>," <unk> has these <unk> and <unk> these <unk>. What do you want to do? "
You know, <unk>, what do you do? "
And the <unk> says, "At it, he's <unk>, and these <unk>, and <unk> <unk>."
"What do you want to do?"
And you say, "<unk> if she was me, what would you know?"
And the <unk>: "But I'm not her."
The <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, <unk> that makes it look like a good thing.
But actually it's not that a <unk> the weight and the weight of making decisions from someone knows something, <unk> the <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and it's certainly not <unk> -- and so it's not <unk> -- and so it doesn't in the <unk> <unk> for the patient.
There's a huge <unk> of products, <unk> to people like me and you, that if you think it doesn't <unk>.
But if we can't <unk>, why do we <unk> them?
The answer is that they want to <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> of so fundamental as it is our <unk> <unk> is a question of choice, as you see in this <unk>. "We don't want to <unk> the children. <unk> the right now. <unk> the kids at the right now. We have to <unk>.
And we can <unk> them.
which means that every <unk>, you have to decide that kind of person being.
<unk> to the family and <unk>, a time the common perspective, <unk> almost <unk> for everyone, was that <unk> the <unk> as possible, and it <unk> to <unk> children as possible.
The only real choice was with who, not when, and even what to do after.
<unk>, it's really to play.
<unk> to students very smart, and they're going to <unk> them 20 percent less work than a time.
And not because they're less <unk>, not because they're less <unk>.
But why they're <unk>, <unk> to <unk>, "<unk> <unk> or not? <unk> it?"
"<unk> <unk> later? I have to think about the children or to the career?"
They're <unk>.
And they try to answer these questions, even if this <unk> doesn't <unk> the <unk> that <unk> and not get a good <unk> to my <unk>.
And they have to do it. They're important questions.
Now, the work: we're <unk>, as <unk> <unk> <unk>, because technology allows us to work every minute, from every corner of the planet, <unk> that <unk> from <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, there's a <unk>, and I'm going to say, "" "<unk>," where the <unk> works. "
I don't tell you, because I want to use it.
What does, this incredible freedom of choice that we have about the work? Is that we have to <unk>, <unk> in every moment, if we have to work or not.
We can go to our son to <unk>, with the <unk> in the other, and the <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, on <unk>.
And even if they're all <unk>, every minute that we see our son, we're also <unk>, "I have to <unk> this call?"
"I have to <unk> this <unk>? I have to <unk> this letter?"
And even when the answer is, "not, it makes the experience of your son very different than what it would be in other conditions.
So, from any part of the look, things and great, objects, <unk> materials and <unk>, life is a question of choices.
Once the world was this: <unk>, there were some chance, but not it wasn't a question of choice.
The world of today is, <unk> to this: The <unk> is, "Is it a <unk> thing, or <unk>?"
The answer is <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> <unk> them all, so I'm going to talk about <unk>.
<unk> this choice <unk> two effects of two effects of people in the people.
The first one, <unk>, is that it <unk> instead of <unk>.
With a lot of <unk> between which, it's very difficult to do it.
<unk> you a <unk> example: a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
A <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> society.
What she found is that for every 10 solutions that are <unk> in more, the <unk> of <unk> <unk> of two percent.
With 50 <unk>, there's 10 percent in less than <unk> when they're only <unk> <unk>. Why?
Because with 50 <unk> of the <unk> of which is, it's hard to decide, and the choice is <unk> to <unk>.
And <unk>, <unk>, and still <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and of course, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, never come.
<unk> that is not only that these <unk> <unk> <unk> food for <unk> because they don't have enough money, it means that the decision is so <unk> that we're also <unk> the <unk> <unk> of <unk> work.
They don't <unk>, they're <unk> to <unk> <unk> for a year from work, which would be <unk> to <unk>.
So <unk> is a <unk> of having <unk> choices.
And I think it's going to be the world.
"And to end, for <unk>: <unk>, <unk> or <unk>?"
<unk> right to take the right decision, if it's for <unk>, it?
You don't want to choose the wrong, and <unk> the <unk> <unk>.
So this is the first effect. The second is that even if we can <unk> the <unk> and make a choice, at the end of the <unk> of how we were <unk> with less <unk> between which you.
And this for several reasons.
One of them is that with a lot of <unk> between which, if you're going to <unk> one and not perfect, it's easy to imagine that it could make a different choice that would be better. And what happens is that the <unk> <unk> <unk> us to <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk>, and the <unk> <unk> from the decision,
And even when it was a <unk> decision.
<unk>, <unk>, <unk> is easier to <unk> of any <unk> that is <unk> of <unk>.
And also, there's what <unk> call.
Dan <unk> has <unk> very well <unk> as the value that we give things from this with.
<unk>, <unk>, when there are many <unk> possible, it's easy to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> and being less <unk> than <unk>.
Here's a example. I'm going to <unk> with all those who are not in New York.
But that's what it probably <unk>.
There's this <unk> to the <unk>.
A <unk> place.
<unk> <unk>. <unk> day. It's all for them.
I don't know anything. But what he thinks is, "Well, <unk>, <unk>, it's <unk>."
"All my <unk> are <unk>."
"<unk> <unk> right in front of the home."
And it's <unk> two weeks from the idea that is <unk> -- every day -- the chance of <unk> where it wants.
The <unk> <unk> <unk> for what we have, even when the choice was <unk>.
And the more <unk> that we have <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> us against the <unk>.
Here's another example.
This <unk> tells us a lot of things.
It's about living the moment, and maybe the time.
But the most important point is that anything you're going to be <unk>, you're going to be <unk>.
The things that don't have many <unk> that can make less <unk> what we do.
<unk> <unk>. <unk> <unk>.
I tried it on my skin <unk> a new <unk> of <unk>.
<unk> almost always <unk>.
Once the <unk> were just a kind of <unk> them and <unk> <unk>, and they were <unk>, only after <unk> <unk> a life and <unk> a lot of times, they were <unk> a lot of times, they're going to go well.
So, I went to <unk> a couple of <unk> when the <unk> were gone, and I said, "I need a couple of <unk>, this is my <unk>."
The <unk> said, "<unk> wants to <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>?"
They want them to <unk> or <unk>? "
"
"<unk> <unk> them, or <unk>? <unk> <unk> <unk>. <unk> <unk> <unk>.
I was <unk>, and after a little bit I was able to say, "I want the only guy that was that -- was the only guy who had ever been." I'm <unk> <unk> <unk>, then <unk> <unk>, then <unk> from the <unk>, <unk>, then <unk> from the <unk>, <unk>, and then <unk> from the <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and then I was going to <unk>,
It was the <unk>. With all that choice had <unk> the best.
But I'm worse.
Why? I wrote a whole book for <unk>.
The reason I was worse is that with all my <unk> were <unk>, the <unk> <unk> to be <unk>, the <unk> <unk> to be <unk>.
At the beginning I had <unk> <unk>. I didn't know anything about <unk> when I was just a kind of, but when I was 100 different, <unk>, at least a perfect guy had to be perfect.
What I had <unk> was good, but not perfect.
After I was <unk> with what I was <unk> in <unk> <unk> to the <unk>.
The <unk> of <unk> in the life of people don't do <unk> the <unk> that these <unk> with the <unk> of the same.
And this <unk> <unk>, even when the results are good.
<unk> in the world of <unk> <unk>.
Because if I <unk> it, I'm not going to be talking about.
The truth truth is more at this.
"You know," The reason why was it was going to be worse when you're worse is that when you're worse was worse than when you were <unk> <unk>.
<unk>, in the world that we live -- <unk> citizens with the <unk> of <unk> -- the <unk> that we can <unk> is that things are <unk> to the <unk>.
You've never ever been <unk> <unk> because your <unk>, my <unk>, <unk>.
The <unk> of happiness -- that's what you're here -- is, "<unk> <unk>."
I mean -- small moment, I'm really <unk>, and my wife is really <unk>.
I couldn't have better, I couldn't do better.
But <unk>, it's not a <unk> thing.
<unk>, a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> when there is just that when you're not just that when you're not <unk>, and you're going to tell you, "Why?"
"Who is <unk>?" The answer is <unk>.
The world is the <unk>. What I could do?
When there are hundreds of types of <unk>, and they <unk> a <unk>, and you get a <unk>, and you know, you know, it's <unk> that the <unk> are you <unk> you.
They could do better.
With hundreds of <unk> available, there are not <unk> for <unk>.
So when people make decisions, even if the result is <unk>, you're <unk> and give them the <unk> to them.
In the last years, the <unk> is <unk> in the <unk> world.
I think a <unk> <unk> -- not the only, but important -- of this <unk> of <unk> is that people have experiences <unk> experiences because the standard are too <unk>.
And when they have to <unk> this situation that <unk> is they think they're doing it.
So the final result is that we're better, <unk>, but we're going to <unk> it.
Let me tell you.
This is the <unk> <unk>, what we're going to take for good. It's not true.
There's no <unk> that a little bit of choice is better than <unk> at all, but from this is not <unk> that much better than a little choice is better than a little bit.
There's a <unk> value, <unk>. I don't know what it's.
But I'm sure we've been <unk> by a piece of the level where we <unk> our lives.
Now, from the <unk> <unk> -- I almost finished -- from the point of view of <unk>, <unk> is the <unk>.
What makes it all this choice in the <unk> society is the <unk> material.
There are many places in the world, and you're <unk> <unk>, where the problem is not that they <unk>.
The problem is that they're too <unk>.
So, the <unk> I'm talking about is a <unk> <unk> of <unk>, <unk> society.
And what makes <unk> and <unk> is this: <unk> <unk> <unk> you talked about yesterday, <unk> <unk> <unk>. It's a <unk> of money. It's a <unk> of money.
I mean that these choices, <unk> and <unk>, it's not that they're just <unk>.
They're <unk>.
They do worse.
If a little bit of what in our society allows <unk> choice was <unk> in those where people have too few possibilities, it would not only have their life to <unk>, but also our own own.
This is what <unk> call a <unk> <unk>.
One of the income is good at all -- not only to the poor -- because of this choice in <unk> that we're <unk> us.
And so, to <unk>, you can become all you want to --
<unk>, people of culture, <unk>, "But what's going to do that fish?"
"It's <unk> that you can't make any <unk> in a glass <unk>."
"A <unk> imagination, a <unk> view of the world --
and I <unk> it so, at the beginning.
But then, <unk>, I realized that that the long knows that that fish knows long.
Because the reality is that if you <unk> <unk> the <unk>, so that it's all possible to be possible. "You don't <unk> the freedom. You <unk> the <unk>.
If you <unk> the <unk> in a way that it's going to be <unk>.
<unk> the <unk>, and <unk> <unk>.
Everybody needs a <unk>.
This is almost of course too <unk>, maybe even for the fish, and certainly for us.
But the <unk> of some <unk> <unk> is a <unk> for <unk> and <unk>, for <unk>.
Thank you.
