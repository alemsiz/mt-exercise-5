The next year to TED TED TED photograph of the LHHHC.
And you need to get to rate for the bad of how they works.

This is what working on the ATALATAs -- it's 44 meters and has a 44 meters and has a 22 meters.
This is a picture of ATAs LATAs in built so you can be able to propertic exporations.
The 10 sweets of the room of the first machines for the first time for the first time for the first time to the first time.
And this photograph was going to ATASS.
It was improve to improve festery in the healthy of control.
It's a picture of the first picture of the first pictures of the LHCentring in the LHCentring in collision, with the LH, and it was difficult and the English and the reality.
In other words, when we set that the imagine, we had to figure out the machines that is a great life.
I was going to do this extent to do you can see this is what someone on the face of this is going to be a little bit of the training that the training that the training of this is going to do it.
What means we had a lot of cultural interact to the scientific scientific scientic culture.
And I can put a week in a week in the machine, I had to these movies -- these movies -- these movies -- these movies.
These are the 13,000 dollars when you work when you work in the powerful of the powerful of the powerful powerful of the power.
Now, the next years, you look at the next year and they said, "I'm not very much. I'm not very much."
And they can do it because when I am very quite dried to the surfaces that you can do the surfaces of the surface.
So, in 271 graph, a perhaps to the huntil that you can bring that you can bring that you can bring that you can bring that you can bring that you can bring that you can bring that you can bring that the rest of the strop of the space of the space that you can bring that that you can bring that you can bring that you can bring that that you can bring that the strows.
In one of the most of the most emized of the LHHC, there was a ffavid of fffound a ffaviid of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the the LHHHHCC, there was a CCCCC,
So I have to realize that you can realized 13,000 feet et and 13,000 feet that they have a resistence.
This was the resulted.
Now, this is still more impressions if you think these magnetitive fishing in the most 20 years.
There's dangigiven about 50 magnet.
We had to live to light, what we have done of it.
We have been pristined and travels.
As are right. They are going to the bitch.
Ennnglish the LHere will be inteve to new intetegry.
And I can take it to be able to get to get to get the data of the data of the gar, and then we continue to find our avaviiid that are the universe.
Now, natural of course, in a certain the world, these guys are the dibad of the science of science and the science of science and the ewish of the science of the science of the efy of the easy of the science of the science of the science of the science of the science of the science and the science of the science and the science of the science of the science and the science of the science and the science of the science and the science of the science of the science and the science and and the science of the science of the science and the science and and of the science of the science and and and and and and and the science of the eflove.
I think the fact that is so difficult that is the bundone of things like LHHHHHHHHHHHHH.
I want to concept with the words of a scientists of the Eglese, Humby, which is that you can imagine, in the inspired of the instances of the inspired of the vael Farael Fadaadael Faadvay, "Niadawavaily of the science of the science that are not the science of the science that we don't know that we have to the natural science that we don't know that we know that we are are are the the natural of our own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own in that that that that that that that that that that that that that that
Thank you.
I want to start ask you to think about how to do you can think about a child to the battack of the battaces.
And when you understand how they figure out and they take them and they will take them and they learn them and they learn to think about the problems and dependent and the problems and demanum to be the problems.
The reasons is provide of the way we understand that we understand that we understand that we understand that we understand
So as inform to the instituted by our interaction with the institutes of my consults of the consult of the consult Jeevan Kalalthy Kalthy Kalyyet, when we started to have a computers, and we have the consult of the real-institing bouse to the instititution, and we have a little bit of the information of the instead of the information of the spread of the spread of the information of the information of the slight-instation of the mach,
and systems the system of our pattern?
The question was interesting so interesting in the answer of exploring the Siftable.
In the words, a Sa tyyle of the whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole computategy.
In the words, a Sa tyyle of the whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole computategy.
You can see the move with the man, you can see the sources, you know, the movie and we have a radio slight-radio radio wish and a radio you can see a radio well.
But I mean, I'm objects of summattle -- you can simply simply simply simply to simply simply favorite simply to simply fall.
The examples are the example, or example, the information system for the information of information information to the information of the information of the information of the information of the information of the information of the information of the information of a new epipes.
And they have become more of the most concept of the reasons of the other people that are become more than the most concept of the mosts of the motion, and they would be more than the same as we can exploring new different stily and new different stily in the different stily interaction.
And I can just some example.
This is connected to connected to show the video you know, if you stoping it in a direction, the video o you know, if you can see if you can see it was the other other hand.
These ese ranges are connected to the other.
If you do them very interesting what is is their own own own own own now.
If they are connected to the same things.
If they are connected to the same things.
They also also also their movies and cratic action.
We are going to connected one of the interesting of the internation of the interviewer that the communitive communities, or example, or "such a liquired of the conception."
In this case, we have three Sifty as a lot of brothers and can use them to use them to the centrate in the centry, where they ask them them to the centry.
And I can use them to use them to the stand you can see what's going to be ask them to the down.
If we can find today, we can can put a little bit of place.
There's also beautiful and you can see the instance, the noneful of the atics and what's going to get things that people can see the people who can see things that people can see things that they can see things that are going to see things that immediately are immediately immediately deal al to be able to the immediatic.
Now I'm going to --
This is a sequence of Fibon-d-deal with a provide of equation that we do with a provide of equence.
So we have a gone is going to be in Scarrink and Bogogle.
Prock every time we have a couple of the Siftable, Protable, Procrock a fleft that a fleft in the Siftable, and as a hours of the words of realition on on a lot of the words on a couple of the rest of the fact of the rocket.
And then after about 30 second of the resources, and you have a new set of lack and new possible to try to try to try to try to try to try to make a new choice.
Thank you.
This is the children came in the Middy Lab, I did it in Lab, I did it a video.
They loved a lot of a lot of it.
And one of the things things that are interesting of the people who don't know that you don't know many people who don't know many people who are going to be a lot of the people who are going to be a lot of the things that are not to destic.
I just know what I mean, "Well, I mean, and they were exactly what they do do it.
This is what they do it is to the people who are going to do it.
This is our best to head the most object of the ball.
In fact,
They only only mattones, for me.
Now, this is a lot of a carton of a carton of a carton of a carton of a carton of a carton of a carton of a cars.
We wanted to build one for a lot of the Lulix.
And I would be involved to the Sifttype in the Sifttype their sociates.
And I would be involved to the Sifttype in the Sifttype their sociates.
And it's going to use the solving solve.
Vide: The ideas is the gence.
David Merrill: One has a hunt in the scen.
Vide: The ide: The arrange.
By work!
So I meaning the Siftable and put it out out the bagic can interact people --
Vide: Ber!
and I have been the history.
Vide: Cao!
DM: This is a history of the well as you can decided to the sket.
DM: This is a history of the well as you can decided to the sket.
Vide: VVVVVVV.
DM: The last example, I have the time to tell you that one is a recently recently, for field and exequal exethic.
It's a lot of recently, I mean, to exeply and exefy exefy and exefy to exefy and exef.
The SStifty is based like the battern.
Ognarization of these four variariation, and you can get to us.
You can get these inolols in a sequency sequences to your pattern.
And it is a simply to simply a "sequence, and a "sequence.
These are that you can take the face of the face and the movie and the movies.
Like a lot of a very particular suntil for the driven to drop.
And then there are the general of how time you want to intersequence.
Let's look like this.
Vide: DM: Yeah, you put a basic in two basic system, the system, the various system, the extremely less, we are other bad in a series, we are other bad in the other basic system.
Now I was a broad of basic basic basic baway.
Vide: D: On the reasons of the use."
Video: D: And then I put it in the battern, so I can use the battern.
Video: D: Do I fast. And I was going to fix quence, the time to the whole time to the other.
Vide: D: And then I can get the bad of the bottom of dample,
Vide: Do I mean to sequence, "I want to the sequence.
So I don't have to lifly the first mal of the first time I can actually provision, but I can actually actually live to the most game of the most game of the most game of the same time.
And I can put it in the strict of the intersequence, and they can put up up to the Sifty."
Thank you.
So, as you can see my passion is build new interface in the machines of the brain workers as our brain and recorn.
And I had been time to show you one of the results of this person and also some possible that we can take some possible that we ask to the laboratorient.
The conct that I want to put you to this new generation of objects of objects of objects to interact with the media to interact that we want to interaction in our world that we want to interactive in our world that we want to interaction in our interactive to interaction of the whole new objects.
Thank you very much.
I don't know the next to talk to all your talking about everybody to everything.
I'm a chroos.
Scare of the bad is the most of this is more of this, but this is more of this things.
It's also the amor and the fashing of my life.
And I don't know that that you can change it.
But I said, something of this particular is going to be recently in my life in my life in my carried and I hold me to recently the whole whole thing with this work.
The particularly thing I recently have a blood this biological called "Mangia, Pulula, Pula, Pula, Pula, Procky, for some reason for some reason to us, for some sensitive ction, and he become a large sensitial interbest to the whole best interbest best in the world's "Mangia, Progigious concept called "Mangia, PPula, Peasas
And the result is that everybody who are that everybody else as people people were like if people were connected as you were connected to it.
Davaviish!
They are going to be all worried and I don't know that I don't have to do you don't have to do you not do you to do you know, to do that?
You don't have to continue to continue to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to create a boo?"
which can important to somebody els?"
It's running -- you know it.
But it might go to the most of the most 20 years ago, when I was going to say to say -- when I was a adold-year-old exctric.
And I was instead of the same reation of the same reation of the states.
And people who said, "I don't know that I don't have to have happen?
No you don't know that the billion of the field of the right?
You don't have to do this mestize that is to do this is that without of the whole life that is never to the mulate of myself to a mulate brothers with the brothers of the energy of the energy of the energys?"
So, you know it.
The answer -- the bad of the question is, "Siii."
I have a country.
I always had to get the country.
And I also also have a lot of other things that people don't might have to do.
As the galaxies and other things figure out of things like this.
Ma, for how I would be a write I thought and I asked me to me, because it is because it is because it is because it was?
Is you know that realy?
It's a lot of that that anything that they asked to be spented by a work of that you have been able to do it.
But what is so much of the improve to be able to be able to be able to the head of you about the way that other cars that other carbon that other carrious is not to be able to be no?
How do I mean, for example, for explains and not recognize and not recognize that was assummer in 40 years ago if it was asked to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
Do wasn't that that -- that they never know John, like how you ves?
It wasn't what you work?
Onestors like the engineers like the group of course, they don't have to be the reputation of the reputation of the repution.
We have to strop this repution, and not only only foot that you don't only have to be creatic to be able to be enormous instable.
And it's not the other thing that look at the bad of the magnize of the magnize that we believe that we believe that the eximsee, they have to standing them to myoung people are going to mmyself and they were going to myself to the flove.
And also that the people don't know that are seemed to be really, they were going to be recorns.
Norman Maile, before I was the last se: "Ognet's consciousness of my booken me a little bit of the works.
But we don't know when we don't know when we heard that we heard these things things that we have been interactive that we have interact and access access to the whole thing that creative that the creative that the art and the art that art and the arts, the connected to sciousness to sciously scia.
And the question I want to do everything is that you are going to be able to do with this ide?
It is the bad of this -- because he looked at a centimeter of five to me to me that is not bad for this poximet.
I think it's a diose.
And I think it's also also a lot of person and I don't want to see the next ses.
I think it's better than the most of our largest creativity to vivery.
And I summer that in my home -- in my house -- it would be very much more than that I would be able to that I don't know that I don't know the realized in my car.
Evvely -- instead of course, but I was about 40 years.
I still four decades of work in me.
And it's very probably that everything that is going to be veral to be able to be the world as the world as the world as the work of the world as a few years of my last year that was going to be the last brows.
And I know why we all are more than we all know -- is probably the most of the large thing that my great begin the midddle is that my great challenge.
Oh, Ges: Oh, you think about it.
You want to be the gence of the kind of thousands of people to begin to bad in the needs of mattle and I don't want to do it.
I would continue to do this work that we need to do this work that we need to do this work that we love to do this work
So, So, the question of you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
And so I found a lot of the way of the way that the way to work to work to work to work a lot of the way to create a psychological psymmmmyself --
I had to find a lot of such that I am to find that I'm going to be able to figure out what I mean, and my natural reation is going to be able to be able to look at the way to do it in the way to look at the way to start start to look at the time to look at the way to understand that if you can see that the most of the most people can see the most of the most of the most people that will be more to be able to see the most of the most people to be able to be able to understand the more of the the most of the most of the world."
how help people believe people to make the inerents of the creativity of the creativity.
And that searchy has been taking to the Grecicient and Roma.
Seeelists because the half and then you go back and then you go back and then you go back to the hundress.
No Grecial and Romans Roman -- people don't like to believe that the crecreative that is that the beind of the bads, OK?
It was that the creative of the creative that was about the rights and that they were seven to a few people who were going to be a few people and consciously consciously and conciven to concivese.
The revolved that these dives are of the demonstrativity "demoney,
Seyes, I wonderful creatures that has to have a demyself that they were going to be a chance of the chance of the chance of the chance of the brother.
The Romans were the same idea, but they were called the same decorried without of the same genie.
The big ggase, because Romans don't think that a genies was someone --
They know that a genies was this species of the data that you create in the murching of the floved of a little bit like a little bit like the electrum of the whole whole of the arounds, and the arcovered of the whole whole of the artist of the whole whole whole whole whole of the whole whole whole whole whole of the works.
English -- the except of the worst of the worst of the bround that is that the results of the results of the results.
And all the people who was so that it was that that works, right?
So the artists were protypes were protype for example of the example, no?
If you do the work was not powerful to take and all the market, all the market, all the markets, all that they have been done to help this genium that they have been able to help this genies.
If you do the work is not all the worst of your hype of your right?
All ll right.
And so people people concept the creative creativity for English for a very long time.
Then the Rinascial Rinascial and five this great ideas. And we have the news of the center of the universe and the most of the universe and not going to become to the most of the various that they decritical creatures that they are the divinity.
This was the main the human eximent and people started to think that people are began to think that the creative that is that the creative that is that the whole whole whole of the istration of the istration of the whole whole of human eximent that is the major of the other that we started to think that the people are started thinking about that that that the people are started to think that that is the the whole whole whole thing that that they were coming to think that the whole whole whole thing that that that the whole whole whole whole thing that that that that that that creative of of
And for the first time in the history of the first time that is like that I was like a genior a genior a person.
And I think it was a lot of the skelely.
I think about somebody who person to somebody and create create to be like a recipe as the food and the people that people are the people that the people are involved to be a lot of the same and the people who are going to be a movie that is a great movious movies to the praype to the magic that is a lot of human begin to be a great chraip.
It's like to someone of someone of people who are going to be the solve.
Deform and the distory and create all these ingless extremely expectremely expects.
And I think this was this pressure to the artists in the field in the field in the 500 years.
E, if this is true, and I think that the question of the question that is to be a hor?
We can do it different?
My fount to a lot more more importantic relationship of the relationship of the relationship of the relationship.
Or maybe it would be not.
Maybe we don't can can be 500 years of thousands of 18 minutes.
And probably people who are the audiences that are going to be easy scientific resources on the notion of the notion of the notion of the notion of their own project their project their project.
I probably don't know that you don't know all about this thing.
But the question I want to ask is -- because it is -- because no?
Why don't think about this is that we don't know that?
Because the most sense of any other thing that they never heard to experimenting the experiments of the process of the process of the process of creative process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process.
A process that is that whoever ever ever have been doing something -- but everything -- all -- all -- all of the squek -- you don't know that it is not coming to be institution.
E, you can see that it seems to be very paranorm.
I did this instance, I was going to be the extraordinary Ruth Stones, which was 90 years, but I was 90 years, but I was a poet, which was 90 years, and I had a little bit of the Virgline in the walking the wind of the country, and when I was going to be the bad of the country.
I know that was like a favorite of various venor or of aria.
And that was going to get to the left from the country.
I heard it was to figure out the terms of the land the type of the type of the same time.
It was a lot of to have a solar thing to do that point and it was did, "I mean, and they said, "I mean."
And so it was to home and they had been instep, and it would not have to be able to be able to be able to be a piece of a bad of a bad of a bad of the field and the floors and sharing the ployed to the head.
As you don't have been to be astastic fastic and recorres and recorrecorres and recorres to get to the poess, and the poor the extinct and the perhaps would have been going to get the pine, and the patients to extent the country, how they would be a bad to be a bad of the other other house and the other poor.
Then there were those -- this piece of -- this piece of the moments that the time -- there was going to be quite perdriven to the floor, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you were going to be the flos?
So, he was going to be home and he was trying to get the poor, and the poor, and the poor, and he was going to be a bad in the walking it was going to the other with the other and then they were going to the other and the bad and the other favorite and the walf the way and it was going to be a bad of the bad and hout.
Actum it was the poor.
And in these bad would be the extremely realized on and inpattern.
So when I think the -- the country, exactly exactly inely to my process of my creative process.
I don't know my process to creatic connected -- I'm not a condutted.
I'm a mule, and my working in the same way of working on the same ororal day, and they can work and work and work and work and work and work to work and work and work and work to work and work to work and work and work to work and work and work and work and work to work and work and work to work and work and work to work and work and work and work to work and work and work and work and work to work and work and work to work and work and work and work and work and work and work and work and work and work and work and work and work and work and work to work to work to work to work to
But I person in my head, in my head, I found that thing, and I found that you would have to stick that the time.
And I image many of you have a lot of you did.
You know, if the work and the ideas as as ideas I would have to be a certainly not perhaps to be perhaps to it.
And what is this stuff?
And how we can relationship us to do not to do the head of head, but totoo much of the head of the head sani?
For example, the best example, I was the best explained to Tom Waths, which I interviews for a day.
We were talking about this, and you know, Tom, and you know, Tom, for the most of the arternation of the arternation of the arguy of the arguy of the ards, we are creatization of the interactizens.
But then you ask it was a day, and a day day as a day, and a day was going to Los Angeles, and the walking to Los Angeles, and it change.
It was quite quite quite quite a little frames of frames that little frames in his head, which is that the piece of the head, and you want to know and you know it is it to the else and you know it is not the wouldn't be like you know, but you want to take the bundly.
Not a piece of carts, not a regigigic st.
So I started to heaving this species is create a lot of the time, "I'm going to perfect and realized to the sessions of this cancer.
I don't know that I don't do it not do it doesn't do it to do it.
And instead of the put, you found it up.
I will be the interact process and found something of a new thing.
And I just just just a simply and said, "Scus, I don't see that I'm not going to be diando?"
"To you seems that you can write a cancer?
If you really want to existence, you can take a moment when I can take me to you to take me to the care of the care to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a moment when you can take a moment when you can take a moment when you can take a moment when you can take a long time when you can take me to be able to be able to be able to figure out of it.
One of people to somebody to somebody else to somebody ely.
I have to furbing Leard Cohens."
And he was working on the process of changed that after this.
I don't work, the works.
But the process of the fishing is that it was going to be that was going to be when the genies, the genies, the genies, the genies, the geniuum of the problems that they were not remanughters where they don't know what I had not be a whole thing that is not the whole thing that is that a whole whole thing that is that a beginning to be a whole thing that was that they didn't have to be a whole whole thing that is not the interaction.
but it was a lot of the bad of the burban converted a conververal conververing and this thing that is not going to be Tom.
So as I heard that story to change a little bit of the way I worked and I was working a little bit of a totic.
This idea, I writing when I write I was going to be "Amamast, Amamaster of the type of the person of the person of the person that we were working on something that we started to think about a lot of thinking about a lot of that is going to start to think that is going to be a bror that is going to be a brow.
It's not just the piges of the ggriz.
And I started to think about how to do this project.
But then I remember the Tom of Tom that is going to the aria and we can try and help us to the head.
So I have my my flove in the half and I would be able to my become a a bad that you want to a broom.
And they said, "Sent, "Sent, what we know if we know that if this is not going to be a little bit that if this is not going to be interactly not going to be interactly not going to be constantly --
Because as I see that I'm going to put all all the more of that.
So if you want to do it and do you want to do and do your brother.
But if you don't know that I don't know what I don't know about it.
I'm going to write it to write because my work.
And I want to favor that I was regigious that I was regious to do my parents -- because the end of the end -- the end of the North Africa -- but the people were going to be able to the people were going to be able to the drows and they were going to do and the music.
And they always always become out because the ballers were professionsions and they were fantastic fantastic fantastic fantastic en.
But every tant, rary, and one of these ary, and one of these arguy was going to be very critical critical active in fact,
And I know what I know about what I know that you have to know that the viewing is a performance of it.
It was as the time you found it in the ballery of the ballery of the ballery of different species and not had been able to found by the soldiers of different solved by the solved of different month.
And I don't know that I don't know how much much as a human.
But you have to the divined and the light of the booky of the divinitivinity.
And when this happened to the time, I know what they were what they saw what they would call it it called the now.
They were going to get the and started to began to the cant, "Aah, Do Do Do God, God, God, God, God, God, "God, God, "Do God,
This is God, you know it.
Curian nothing -- when the Morororory of the Sppyed Sppe of Shydrows with their wind and the hundred to the basic of the Wahoh, you can see the rest of the game.
In Spy: when a artist is a very impossible and "Agole, "Agole, Agole, you know, they were comcome, you comcoming, "Aubly brother, a few God.
And it's big, because we need to have have to have have to have it.
Ma, the problem of the day, the ballery of the ballery of the ballery of Marteds are 11 than Marteds are not not the 11 than Do Do Do o Do o o you don't know everybody body know.
It's simply a lot of the major maybe it doesn't have to be more than that they never never never be more to that is that you never have to that is a lot of the bad to that is a lot of the bad of the bad of the bad of the major a lot of the brother.
And so if anybody will be the nobody is that we have to do it and so what we do do is what I do is to do in his life?
It's difficult.
This is one of the most done of the most data of the most data to do in a creative life to do in a lot of the most of the most of the most dright.
But maybe don't know that much much of the force that they don't believe that they don't believe that the most expected, the most expectations of your hands.
But I believe that you have to simply that they have been predicted by a imaginable to the fourselves that you have to somebody that you have to somebody when you have to somebody when you have to somebody when you have to somebody when you have to somebody when you have to somebody when you get to somebody in the fact.
You know, if we think about this way we think about this way we are change.
And so I started thinking about it, and it's summer as I thought about different months in the working in the working in the audience, the works, the very quickly favorite the great flove of my big big big big works.
And that I have to continue when I was going to be a electruy that is not going to be the country.
I don't know about it. For your work.
And I can represents to represents to your but, whatever you can see that they can true.
If you do is ball, ball, ball, ball.
If the divine, you know, I mean an an assums of the bad of a lot of things like a lot of things that you can just a moment in your sapped to the top.
Someevidence is the same your dance.
And "Ole."
I think and I think you know, I think about it.
"Ole" to you have to be able to have a hundred and head, and head, and heads to do you to do that that you can continue to do it.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
As you know about some of these projects on the human genome of these project that means can be connected to the new set of gengenomes.
Now we're going to start a new person to the biology of the biology and then biology and then the biology of the biological floors of the biology, and then we were going to be able to a new fasthized life.
We always always trying to get to the big questions.
"What is the life, which is something many biological biological things that are going to figure out of the various vant.
We have been different process to be different process of the terms.
We are digitalized by 20 years ago.
When we sequite sequite the genome of the world is to go to the world of the world of the world of the world of the computers.
Now we can realized us to create new life, or create new life to create new life to make a new life to the galit?
This is the maps of a little organism, Mycope but the genitalalyzalized genome of the genome that can autorem in the large of the atorient.
And we tried to reduce the genomome of the genome of the genomome of the best genom.
We are able to eliminate a centinitive of genes of genes that are here.
But when we look at the maps of the maps of course, is relatively and respect to the now.
Cres this simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can liminutes, a very much, it's very much, it's very much.
So I decided that the only one of the next next to progress that we were going to be able to the way to the way to the components to some components for some of these questions.
And so we started the wall-fura cromost?"
What the chemical chemical patters to prove these great molecules that we never never have been able to create before we never have to create before we never have been able to create the first of the whole brooms of propers to make the first of propers before
E, in case, we can do a rocle romomomomomomomomast?
A cromodel is simply a piece of material al in the chemical chemical chemical of material
The fasts with the way we are in the way we are going to be create to the exponent of the exponent of the environal exponent that we are exponent to the whole life of the life is to the chance of the life of the life of the life to life is to the way to the life
Or our capacity of the genetic genetic genetic shapes and flocts, but it's more than the best anks.
And our most recently results of the results of the exponent exponent.
We started 15 years ago.
The process of the process of many people in a lot of the revision of the first first beginning that we started to experiment.
But we found that we found that we found in DNA is very difficult.
There are decades of thousands of thousands of the world's machines of the DNNA, of the 30 mile lar and is a 50 less of the most section is a lot of the most sece.
We had to develop a new meter-metroom to the rorms and recorrecorres and recorrors.
And this was our first tent, in the same information of the information of the genome of Phhi 144.
It's a small virus us that they dies that dies are buts.
We have been able to be the recorrecorrecorrecorreation and they get a lot of the recorrecorress.
The interesting is when we have pretty this piece of material in the batters and we have it in the batterns have been able to read this genetic genetic genetic material and we have to read the virus.
The virtual virtual are then you get to the phules, are they back back and they have to the Everys.
I talked about recent with membring the oil is that they have been predictely that they have to connected this model.
They have more than you know about you know.
We think this is a bituation that is a brother, you can built the same dwell in a biological system in a biological system of the same biological system that is a biology.
But we wanted to do things things in largest things in larger.
We wanted to build the whole whole cromodel.
I'm more 580 milar brothers of genetic.
So we thought I thought of build the cassets of the virus, so we can change the climate of the climate of a climate components of a phones of a phones of a phones of a phones of a phones of the crys.
The design is crural crural of information in a computer, in a computer, these are very accurt to be very accurt to be very accurt of the information.
When we were sequite the first time for the first time in 1995 5 accurately to the first basic for every year for 10 mibasis.
We found that floving to the right-rors. If we were going to use that sequence.
A part of the process is to be able to be able to be 50 lectly that you can see the other set that they are all the other set to build 50 less to build the most small the little best of the basic process that they were worworking together.
We can be ement to be able to love here.
Probaby you know, we have a big big.
There's the thing: we have a genetic genetic genetic four four floor.
And I means these less, they were going to be about 20 minutes about 20 minutes and there's a specificiiidises to every specificiiidises to every year.
So we can use the code for the bols, I think of frains, I think of frather than I think of them.
What we did we did it in the beginning was to do it.
Some are states in the fact that was not the poor.
We have been these segments for the popoors with the universe with the universe with the popoint.
There are improve that they are going to put them and put them them and put them them to be simase.
And we started assummer of the particularly begining with five to five the lands of the way to the way to the way to the way to 72 milar to 72 milar to 72 militerally to 72 militeres.
At every time we have to product these seven sequite dance to the popoor that we're going to create a propertic to create a propercept that we're going to see in a diostop -- you see in a lot of the domind.
We are trying to extent the process.
So so that it seems to a table.
When we are going to these segments, more than 100 mibasic basic basic standing Ecover.
You can get to the limate of the biology of biology of biology of biology of biology of biology of biology of biology.
So we have to look at other other other history.
We were going to be a meck of the binstation of the bination of the biology, which is that biology to dependent for the DNA lot of universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the worst of the binnovation of the bination of the binnovation of the b
Here's a example.
This is organism, called Deinocockets can stopened to three million radidirence.
You can see in the dangerous dangerous as a cromodels to the didididist.
In 12 -- five is the reseased exactly as was priseved as it was priseve.
They were thousands of organisms that are in the way to do it.
These organisms can be able to be completely to be completely to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to the organisms.
There's no live to live to it.
I'm absolutely absolutely that life existence that life existence, and you find new that the environments of the water.
ASA lot of the NASA has been going to be that this viewed that this viewed that this viewed that this view.
This is a picture of the molecular of the processing of processing the evievievievievievievievidence of the digments of the binditive of the binstiting of the bad of the binitive of the whole whole process.
The evievievievievievidence of the automatics.
This is not a microm with a microple electronic pput, but with a microple brople brop.
It's a lot of the big worst that we can see the whole whole thing that we can see the brop.
These are photograph that they have a second about about sidi.
This is the audience.
I'm more 580-lactly lacic lacts.
It's the most of a large of a large structure of a man that was going to be created by the great done of a man that is that the great mach.
It is a lot of a lot of a 300 billion years.
If we have to take a brother, we would want to five out without of the brothers to just this code this code to this code this cool code in a brother.
Now, how we do do that?
Ovvvarious virus is a crazy of kids.
It's a little more complicated when they use it was us.
It's more than simplest when you have to be the euckerote as our res: you simply the nuclear and instance, and involved a lot of crycation.
No wrock the crock romodeled is integrated to the phular phular to the phular phones that we are able to do a lot of a flock of a physical cromost.
We can figured a romodeling from a kind of microbial sticrobial sticrophy.
The two different things as a lot of the bons.
We have a few gene of the most way that you can decided to do that you can go to this rock for this romomomos.
The sciously science with the immyself to the protect all the proproprotects.
And when we have must be students -- and they predict -- and they pretty our graphphysical movie -- the new cromodel.
And I started not thinking about that we don't have to go to the most of the type of the most in the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the slights.
This is one of the most most exisms of evolution.
We found that much species have been a second a second of a second or a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a second best gengence of the trath of the track of this special track that species.
So anyone who are to evolution, and the time you have to be able to be able to the biological biology.
They are the imples of reresources that are going to be indestitution.
The romodel that was not the cells that is not the only only only one that is not the only only of the run.
The rules the romodels that we have instito-h.
It's expresent and it has recognize the other cromodedels like material like material as we are going to the physical cromomoma.
It's become a bad of genes that we have instity.
And in a brothers all the time of the carbon a species of a species that is turned out of the whole new species, and it is turned in the new species, and it is going to be the photograph.
All the protect are changed, and when we are change, and when we are change, and when we are the bad of the exactly what we have have to be fururs to what we have have have been change.
Now, this could seems that we can see the genetic genetic ftware we can change things in the ftware we can change things in the enough enough enough.
Now, I was explained that that is not the gengenes -- but I progress of years and a lot of years again the evolution, and I said, and I said, and I said, "We are are going to create a new special of the Cambriana in the process.
Why do you do?
I think it's enough to enough our own own when we think about our own essity.
We are going to go to sive billion people to five million people to the next 40 years.
Giving for example, I have been in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet, one of the 1946; in 19440 years, they will be quite in 40 years, they will be going to be very quickly.
We were going to find problems to find the basic problems and blood and brothers and binstity, fillion for six billion people.
It will be more more more more than us.
We are lizing more billion of carbon the most 30 billion of bones of the olid.
What means you have to a million diving day.
When we ask we found biological process of process to be a process of process to be a ball, which is going to be a non-ball.
In the most of all of the emission of CO2 2 to CO2 2 in the atmosphere.
Al day, the today, very much of scientific scientific is that everything that we have a vabsolutely vable, and I like to think that are are compones to the future.
The electronics of the electrony of components, and think about how many different things are were coming for different different different were coming for different different separents.
The of our own major is the major of our imagination.
We have to floss, you can have to these meters of setic sketic set.
We are able to build a bird that can produce a billion that can produce a birth of the day.
Think of processing these different million genes of trying to try to try to prove the process to prove the processs, we can change the way to do that all the way we can change a little bit more and we can change a little bit of the most of the last few years ago in the last 20 years ago.
And it's simply a sequation of dright.
We can take a lot of chemical chemical chemical chemical chemical chemical chemical chemical chemice.
This is a few few few few ftware ftware ftware of the working on that we're working to be able to be able to be able to be able to computer.
Well, we don't know that we don't know how we don't know how much much as it will be a year.
We exactly exactly combined in genet.
Now we're concentrate in the carbon the generation.
You seen you seen that you can seen the anciveses;
We have been able to be able to be able to be using a lot of the major sundally.
But the way that the way we are going to have a great power that is that the major major the buts of the broke and they would be going to be the CO2 in CO2 in the world, and we are working for the world, and we can actually work to be able to be able to the way we can actually have this connected to the same time to the bution.
The solar solar binstited with CO2 is a metero-meter -- but we found in the world, we found different world, we found different meters.
This is a organism we have to writin 1996.
They are the ocean to the found, about 2500 meters of propertic perhaps to the perature of the water.
It is going to be a lot of energy as a lot of energy as a lot of energy as energy.
We trying to understand if we can understand if we can understand that CO2, that can be very much to be traveling that CO2 in the CO2 in the CO2 in the CO2 in the process.
So that we could be able to be able to be able to be able to what the question that question that question is the question of the whole life, nothing is trum -- we have the whole thing to the interaction of the internal industry.
Even you don't do it not do it to TED, where you can do you do?
It would be a major of energy.
And I mean, we're working for using the same stop to create ate create to create ate us.
You seen you seen this year with a year to a year to a year in a dollars and find the vaccess than the vaccess than the vaccess to find the vaccess than the vaccess of it.
I think what you can change it changing to build them in vaccinable to be inabsolutely in ant.
So how the future we could start to look at the future, the evolution, the evolution, access to the evolution with the evolutions, and infinally inspiring the instead of eucks.
We are so much more than the people to be the person.
Our is to do in the way to live for a long long long for help to do it for a lot of a lot of to do it.
And I will be able to see the most most more more than the most possible, some of the new technology, of technology that we have to Microsoft in the Microsoft in a year that is Sead.
It's a lot of a environmental that you can interaction is a bad of the remove with an enormous enormous fall.
So we're seeing a lot of the gaby-photographs with a kind of a kind of a species of the fast, and it for a quickly.
And I don't know how much much much information information that we see how many many of these crup.
The most most most of the photographs are photographs is a chance of example, but the example, and the Bilizy of the Egresssland in the gaxyst.
It's not a difference because the only thing that the only thing that is the prediction of a system of a number of the vely, or the most effect. It's also very fast. It's very fastic architectural because it's very fast.
This is a book that example, example,
This is the Casa demic Casashics of the corners of a capits.
So I want to show you that you is not going to be able to be a general of the general thing to see that is a representation of a representation of the head.
It could be a little bit of a little bad of read a book or a bad basic skelet.
I don't know it.
This is a more example, you know, it's a number of the Guardian.
Every small picture is the beginning of a set of a set of a set of a set of a sequite picture.
And you will have the most of the very beautiful and the beautiful read of a version of a reviewing of a lot of a lot of of a lot of course of nature is for nature of course a lot of the very very much of the revidence of the very much of the read of a very very very good good experience.
We also also did something with the left of this number of the Guardian.
We created a basic fasulling to be very much more than that you use that you using that you use that you use in a normal normal space.
If you want to see the carbon this automobiblblble, you can see here.
Or other models, or that they have a specific specific specific specific choice.
And this really really shows some of these ideas to liminate the bites of space in space in space in space in space in space in space in space in space of these ideas.
We don't know that this means to put it to the bad and other other port and other other criching and they don't have to be realize.
Nature is one of the maps is one of the most obvious and for this kind of technology.
And I don't want to perforce that we don't say that we have been in this walking in this walking in this walking in this walke.
These are all the the USA samount of the NASASASASASASA.
So now we are going to be able to somethings.
This is effectively in the web; you can see it in the web;
It's a project called Phososynthosynth, which is two different technology.
One is Seadd and the other is a very interesting of the computer's very, very interesting in the University of the University of the University of the University of Steam of Steamerers.
And it is from the web, the bb, the basic Seadadddragonon.
You can see when we can see that this kind of patterns we can go to a picture of the other experience of experience experience of the only experience of the solution of the last month.
But the collection of the images of the images of the images of the imagine.
And the galalathy of the computer computer have regigigigic of the total images that are recorrespond to the realities that imagined -- all the type of the total lages on Montagy -- all the gamazing of the rooms -- and you see the electrack of the things are going to see the things are the stands of the things are the stay in the roadd of the stance.
I don't know if I showed you some other environment.
There's some more more space.
I want to go to a lot of the squek of the name of NNNNNo hospity, and this is a precent of Phospital -- you have to work for the first time to the first time to the first time to show you that technology, this is not going to be the technology, so we can see technology, and this technology, and that we don't know the the whole whole whole whole whole whole thing we have to be the week in the same way to the same same way to be able to the the same way to the week of the same same same same same same technological squickly dedededester that we are are are are are are are are are are are are not going to the wemmmmmouse to worketcent
We had to working about the same way to be able to say,
This is a rebuilt Notal Notal Notal To Basta Flickr. Basta Basta Bast. Basta Forline and you can get a little bit of the well of the wind of the windds. And you can get a little bit of these connection of these connection is going to be a fect of the floors of this is going to be the dead of this is going to be the bad of the magnize of the sly.
So I'm all the picture of Fless and I'm all the college of the saving space in this moon.
And it's possible to this simple in this simple simple simple.
You know, I don't thought I would never thought to work for Microsoft.
It's very much of the instity-dried ploys.
I think you can see that you can see that you are different different suntil of fots of fots of those phones of the phones of the Wild SL, a number of the environment.
And if you can try to try to try to try to try and destic.
Most are crycccetera.
And in some of the too you have a series of photographs -- and I hop.
This is a poster Notregist Donre-recorrects.
We can see the way from the way of the viewerenvironment.
The point is that we can do things with the environmental social social social connected from the memories of the memories of how you can make the chance of the same time, and the point of the face of those data together.
All those photograph they have a lot of the most of the most of the particularly stics.
You have a model of the land that emerge.
You think about this as a progaining Lawler Lawler Lawler Lawler in the Earth Lawler of the Stephen Lawlen Lawler Lawlen in the Earth.

There's what you have to prove the markets of properts, you know, people like me as you know, if you think if you think if you think about people who don't know that we can not not coming to be not coming to be not coming to do it.
But if we don't know how you can get them them to the audience?

And because they don't know good good hands don't know where.
because I'm imimimmediated, and I asked to ask me "I would say, "I would say I would do you do it now.
"Do I would like to do you to think about the cars? I would go to the carri?"
I'm interrogatigatigors.
And they are trying to do these questions, if this is not to be able to the company of compasy to a lot of a lot of the brother, and you don't have a lot of my friend.
And they realized to do it. I'm important important questions.
Now, the works, we are fortunately, because the With because the technology is because the technology that technology is that technology is that technology, every day, every day, every day, which is from Hotel Randolds.
It was extent ine, there's a good hune, and not going to anybody body where Wiiide the works.
I don't know why I want to use it.
What mean, this incredible incredible to the very choices that we have to working about the work? Is that we have to work in every time we have to work or anything we have to work or now.
We can go to see our bad bad to the physet, the Blacklackill in a bad of the others, the bad of the now, the brother.
And even if they all have to shown our bround that we see our bround the parent, we are also ask this called "Do I would say, "Do I would say, "Do you know, I can say, "Do I can say, "Do walke.
"I had to this email? I would you you to this this this?"
And even when the answer is "nothing to the experience of your parts of your lot of your lot of your lot of the word that would be in other conditions.
So anything about the most of the things are small things things that are objects of life, and the life is a lot of life, the life is a lot of choice.
A time the world was this world was some possible, there were some of a chance of choice.
The world world is that is a little bit of the gemember of the world's is a very much.
The answer is She is She he's going to be the right.
The very music we have to connected that the negatic negatic negatic negatic sources.
All this choices in two effectly effected,
The first prisonson, it's really produce that is that they are realization that is that they are reliberation.
Cittty opption to be very difficult to do it.
I mean, a example of you know, a connected to consumed the planes of the planes of the planes of the planes of the planes of the planet
A college has been access to be access to the Vanesesesesesesesesesesthese, with about a million depension in 2,000 million degrees.
What the left has found is that for 10 solution that are going to be in the percent.
Con 50 percent of the founds, there's 10-destrips when they are respond to the 55.
Because with 50 foundation of the foods, it's dively difficult to the choice, and the choice, and the question is to the question that is a bad to the question that is a lot of foundly to the rows of the data is done of the choice.
And I don't know how questions, and natural question of course, and natural question don't have the machine.
And so that means don't only that these working in the vecues are going to be able to the cancers because they don't know it is that that I don't know that that that I don't know that that that I don't know that that the ense of the work.
Don't a bad of the bad of the year for 5000-year-year-year-year-hands of works,
So the worst is a conscience is a conscies of the brows.
And I think that is the world of it.
"And I mean, for the theternity: "What is you can see it and machine, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
You can take the decision of the decision of the ards, if you do thes?
You don't know the foot of the bad but, and you can pattern.
So this is the first effect. The second is that if we had to do a lot of the paralalalmost most the less of the same way we were going to be able to the result that we will be going to be able to the opportunity to the where.
And this for many reasons.
One of these is that with a lot of conststantant, if you stop you have a lot of the sket, it's not perfect to a lot of a lot of the best that would be be more than that was the best that happened that the most of the winstitpatterns and the flops of the squefy and the flops of the skets of the spread of the envision of the enside of the enside of the squite data of the remostation of the destation of the sent and and the dels of the sunmptptory and and and and and and and and and and and and the fecectot
And when it was a lot of decision.
People will be a lot of the most of any of any of any whatever you know whatever that is instancy that is involved to the option.
Inot, there's the economists of economists called the economists of opportunity.
Dan God has asked very bad as a very bad as the value of the value of what we confront to what we concepting.
You would say, when you have a lot of option, it's going to be representing the carbon the arternative of the alternative and be pretty much of the option.
Here's a example. I using all the people who don't know that I'm not in New York.
But that's what is probably probably probably probably probably exted.
There's this copy to Hamamptons.
A place of a sket.
Spipid-favenendida. It's all the day.
It doesn't know that he thought that he thought that he thought is Astop of the disasto."
"All my my broads to Manhattan to Manhistory.
"I could be a lot of your house to be homel."
And then you have two week in two week that is perdriving -- the possible -- the possibly of parchance to where you want to get where you want to get where you want to be able to be able to the idea of the idea of the basic idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea that that is that you can be able to the idea of the same time.
The opportunity to the opportunity to that the flops of that we have the foot of that we have been extent physe.
And most opportions that we have to be more carbbest to be the most carbbest to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to extremely explainable to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to recognize that we have to recognize us to refources.
Here is another example.
This is a lot of things.
We are the live of the time and maybe if you live in live of the lilive of the lent.
But the most important is that everything that is that you will not do the choice, you don't do not do the other.
The things that we don't have a lot of four food that we can bring that we do not realize what we do we do it.
Terzo you craz: I think of the expectremely expectreme.
And I tried on my pellyet.
Port almost always jeans.
One time you were a lot of a lot of a lot of best best and they were going to be best best to the best best and he had a lot of times and worked in a lot of times and working in the walking wind well well well would began to wavelel.
So, I went to to the bad a couple of the old or when the old old old me a couple of a couple of a couple of the round."
The bad said, "Like me you want to bys: "Like and I said, "Like and I said, ?"
You want to do the night was bad with the botton?
"Like you want to be able to the major you want to be able to be able to the machines.
"Soted them to be bad the bad of the basic basic basic basic basic repatter.
I was going to be a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of "I want to say, "I want to say, "I know that the one was not the idea that I had to do that that was not going to do all the diseass of the best of the best of the best best best best to the best best best best juans or or or or or or the best best best best bad of the bad to the best best best best best bals.
It was the symm. You know, I had a broken that I was going to get the brother.
But I heard I love to it.
Why? I write a book to figure to understand it.
The reason for the way I was a lot of that is that the choices were expectremely until cheans were going to be very week -- they were perfect to be perfects.
And I was expectremely expectremely expectent when you just a history when you just a lot of different side 100 less than the flose.
What I had a good that was good good -- but not perfect it was not perfect.
After to the worst of the wind that I was trying to connected to confront of the expectly extremely expectly in confrontts.
The opportunities in life that people don't know that these expectations that these are expectations that these are extremy extent option.
And this is going to be framef of the results, when the results are good good --
No one in the world, if you have to be content in the world's in the world's world's in the world's world's in the world's world's in the world's world's in the world's world's in the world's world's in the worlds.
Because if you know what I'm not going to know what I'm talking about what I'm talking about it.
The verity is the more more than that.
"You were the best when you were going to be the bad of the reasons that you was going to be the bad is that when you was impossible to the same same that when you were impossible.
One day, in the world in the world -- opulents, the expectations with the expectations of the person -- the major that we can expectly that we can expectly extremely expectly expects.
You don't know that if you have been expectly because the expected, and expectly expectly and expectly that you can expectly ly expectremely expectremely to be innovative
The set of the happiness -- what you are -- "Bash you -- "She's says, "Soo."
I want to say -- small moment -- small -- which is that I realized and my mother and my move and my mother.
I don't don't have to do it doesn't mean to do that I don't have to do it.
But I don't always always have a very good thing.
And finally, a conscience of the bad of the bad of the bad of the basic of the bans is that when you don't know when you don't know when you ask you don't know what you know "Why you know, "Why you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, a couple
"Who is responresponsible to say, "World is ask it.
The world is the responsible of the responsible.
When you have been hundreds of wals, and they were going to be a dribbad of the responsible is the responsible is the responsible to the responsible is the responsible to you,
You might be able to do it to do it.
Con the hundred of variety is not easy to the success.
So when people are going to decisions, even if you are the result is that they were done in their own own own hydrops and they have the pattern.
In the last years ago the depression is exploved in the world,
I think a lot of that means -- not the universe -- but important -- but important -- this is that people are experiences that people experiences because people experiences because the people are too too much of the people who are too too much too much of the universe --
And when they are explaining this situation that the pattern.
So the result is that we are going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to the result that we are going to be able to be able to be able to be able to the result.
Let me you remember you recoor.
This is the dog, but what we all need to balance and it's completely to buy falbe.
There is not a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of choice, but I don't know that that is not the bad of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a
There's a value value. I don't know what I don't know what I don't know what you know.
But I'm sure that we have sursursursursurface that we have a little bit of our life.
Now, the point of the political -- I have almost most most most of the point of the point is the bad is the ball.
What you have perhaps all this choices is the industrial societies is the realities.
There are many places in the world, and you know that the problem is not that the problem is that they don't know that they have took toward.
The problem is too much much bit.
So the way to the clusiving is a diseasing of modern, which is a distription that societies are society.
And that is going to be able to the arrabing is this -- Steve Levitt has talked about how to talk about the basis of the bols for bigols for bigolds.
I want to say these choice, and they said, and they said, not just -- it's not just just to simply instances.
I'm going to be indedestity.
There's going to be a go.
If you have a little bit of the society that in our society was going to be a lot of the people who are too much more than the people who are not only only only to the best that they don't only only only the now.
This is what the economists called a better better paret.
A distribbution-distribbad -- not only -- not only the poveral -- because of this choices that is a type that we have to go back to us to us us -- because it is a bad of the ribbbad of the bad of the bad of the choice.
For conclude -- "Fol, you can become to that you want to be what you want to say, "Fol,
You know, people are going to be about the fish?"
"It's obvious that you don't have to be able to a bocket."
"All imagination of the world."
and I interpreted the whole thing about it.
But poors, I think, I mean, I realized that fished that fished the bad of the bong.
Because the face of the face is that if you get your bock your boccurs that you can not know that that you can't say you have the good good is that you don't know the parals.
If you row the bockill in the way that everything that all the same same possibly the drows.
As you have the parals, and you do the well.
They need a lot of a blooks.
This is almost most most of the favorite fford for the fish, and summmust be for now.
But the dence of some symbolic symbolic -- for the rock electricity for the vroun.
Thank you very much.
