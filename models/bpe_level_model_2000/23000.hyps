I showed these slide these slide to show that the type calculation glacial calculation for almost three million years had had the sizes of 48 percent of the United States of 40 percent.
And yet this is under gravity of the problem, because it doesn't show it to the ice of ice because it doesn't show the ice of ice as ice as ice as ice as ice as the ice of ice as ice as the ice as the ice of ice because it doesn't show it show the gravity of the issue because it doesn't show it to the slip.
The artical climb is -- in a certain sense, the heart clean clean climate system.
You expands of inversus and wind and windled to the summer and wind of the inverse and windles.
The next slide will be a rapid rapid on the last 25 years.
The glyack is replaced in red red red it.
As you see it turns out to the blue skin the blue slight.
This is the ice in invert, which is the glacium --
You can see that the glacium glacium of five years or more, is like the blood locks, which is coming out of the body.
In 25 years of this is going to be like this.
This is a problem because the interested in the artline of the artypically intenormous where there are huge amount of carbon -- and that sheets are being transformed in meters from microbies.
Risped to the totality of the atmosphere, of the atmosphere, that quantity might be double to be spoint of not returned out to be returned out to be returned out.
In some of the slide in Alaska deep foundation of the metan water.
The prophessored prophysed by Alaska is Alaska has been recated team in a team in the team in the team of the University of the University of Alaska folks in the University of Alaska is recated team of Alaska is recated team of Alaska is recated team in the University of the University
Video: Wow! Al Gore: Some is if you wonder.
A reason is that this exchange in the Greenland is surrounded up from the north.
This is a glacial records.
The took never reached the similar levels like that.
This is the Kangerlusa-obest Greenlusa-obest Genland of the Genland Genland
If you want to know how the level of the glevel of the glevel of the glevel of the glevel of the gunger level to the sea.
These corrups are increasing rapidly.
Another part of the planet: Antart, the biggest block of the planet.
The last month last month last month have been declared that the balance, and that the balance, and that Antarcticularly in negative, which is particularly bals, is particularly brows in the shared shared in the sharp of the glacium is particularly rapid in the shot of the glacium is in negative, and
It is a six-foot level level of water, like Greenland --
Himalaya, the third largest block of ice block of ice block -- and they see new glacium in the glacium --
The 40 percent of the world's population was going to put water from the population of the population of the population of the population population was going to be a tremendous injurishing of the population of the population population was going to be a tail.
As Ande: this glacier is the source of the water of this city.
The taken is increased.
But when you diminished, the same across the water to the water
In California in the Nevada is demined by 40 percent.
The ydris are in crisis.
The predictions, like you have slights, are graved.
The growth of the world takes a remarkable increasingers.
The environmental disaster is increasing a returns out of the normal and precedent.
Four times more number than the last 30 years of the last 30 years of the previous recedent.
This is a whole thing of insustainable to it.
If you look at the context of the historical context to the consequences.
In the last five years we added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the oceans every day.
Look at the poor of the oriental Pacific Pacific American to the west, and on the both parts of the continent, where there is a poverimum in the oceans.
The major is global warming, and the deforestation, and the deforestation, which is 20, is the use of combust.
The oil is a problem, and the carbon is lose worse and worse is even worse worse
The United States are one of the two countries with the most emissions, together with the Cina.
And they proposed to build a lot of other carbon and and they were provide
But we're assisting to a change.
These are the annulled projects. And some of the last few years of versus and some of the green alternative projects.
At every way, there's a politics in our countries.
The carbon industries and oil industries have 250 million dollars in the last year to promote the carbon in the last year to promote the charbons and oil bio.
This image I remember something,
Nath Natmal Tennesse, where I live a 3.8 billion literally charbons of choories of carbon of choories of carbon of the guns of the grip of Tennesse, where I live in Tennesse, in Tennesse, in Tennesses of g
Maybe you saw it on the news.
This is the second largest fleet in America.
It's happened around Natmain.
The nnatalian industry of one of the carbon industry was this:
Video: Mr. Frosty the carbon is a type and happy for happiness.
It's spread here in America, and it makes our economy.
Frosty the carbon is more clean is more clean.
It's about the price, adorable and workers are making the stily styly.
At Gore: Do here is a part of the West Virginia.
The largest society on the mountain is Massey Coal. This is Massey Coal.
Video: Don Blankenship: I'm going to talk about -- Al Gore, Nancy Pelosis, Harry Reid -- they don't know what they're talking about.
At Gor: So the Alleance for the Protein of the Clim has launched two nals:
This is a one of it.
Video: Ator: Ators: Actic we see the climate changes like a minator to our business.
So our prioritization is invest a quantity of money in a public effort to make public public and confuses the truth, and confuses the true of the charbon.
In fact, the carbon is not sporks.
We think it's cleased -- it has a good profum.
So not predictate about climate change.
Let me do to do us.
Video: Ator: Carble--- you heard about it.
So let's take a game in a structure to the framework to how it is about how much carbon the clean to the clean to the framework in a structure of the framework to the framework in a structure to the framework on for the frame.
Straordinarily machines are a little while, but this is the sound of the carbon technology.
The carbon is between the main of the main of the global warming for global warming, but the remarkable technology of the carbon that you see changing everything.
Do a look at the cleaning technology.
At Gore: Infinally, the positive swell-positive slide to the economic issue and the national issue of the national security.
Video: Every: The American is crisi; the economy, the national security climatic.
The film that college all of the fact that our dependence from the rest of the rest fossil fuel, like the carbon and the oil and the important.
Now, there's a new audience, there's a new audience.
We have America: 100-percent of clean energy in dieckle years.
They like to reput America in work, to make sure of work, to help us to stop the global warming.
Finally, a solution that is solution that we solve our problems.
Like America. Scover for more.
At Gore: This is the ultim.
Video: Comment: It's about the America.
One of the fastest ways to bring the dependence by the dependence by the combuster that our planet.
I go. The future is here. I mean, a new energy network.
She talked about 2: Nuoves to work for places of work for the well-retributs.
M: Repower America. It's time to be realists.
At Gor: A proverbio African old African old says, "If you want to go to the money.
If you want to go away together."
We have to go away to the slightly.
Thank you very much.
The year at TED phection on LHC.
And I promise to go back to the way to get to how machine.
So I came up here. And for those who are the other time they were not going to have the LHC is the largest scientific experiment that -- 27 kilometers of circumstomer circumstom.
His compiece of reader the conditions that were less than one billion second from the universe -- until the universe -- until at 600 million times a second.
All of this is just environment.
This is the machine under Gineva.
We have these mini-Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Big Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bi-Ws. s. s.
This is what I work. It's called ATLAATLA, is a 44 feet and has a 22 meters and has a 22 meters and has a 22 meters and has a 22 meters and has a 22 meters and has a 22 meters to feet and has a 22 meters and has a 22 meters of meters and has a 22 meters to meters.
This is a space. This is an ATLAATLAA, you can see the proportions.
The 10 sect of the last year we have access, we have access,
And this picture was taken by ATLAS.
It was because of immenses fest-fest-fest-type in the control.
It's a picture of the first picture of the first of LHC, and he had all the way of LHC, and in collision, deliberately, and a part of the LHC, and spread particles.
In other words, when we see that picture the 10 10 to the 10 settember 10 to the machine works, which is a great liftype of the machine.
I don't know if it was this to extend this to do -- when someone went to Google and he saw that the payful payers was this one.
That means we have a cultural impact impact on the scientific impact to what scientific is.
About a week, there was a problem with the machine, had to be a problem with the machines here -- these movies.
These files are taking 13,000-printing maximum of powerful.
Now, technical techniques between you look at the files and they say, "It's not true. I'm files too much under der this."
And they can do it because when they are very quickly cosids of the superconvicts.
So, at least 271 degrees, to a temperature of the space between the stars, these movies can bring that corrupts.
In one of the young of the most of the magnets in the LHC, there was a defect defect defect of the most of the remarkable of the magnets in the LHC, there was a fabrication.
So the files are surprising warm and 13,000 ample prints of suddenly meet to meet a electric.
This was the resulted.
Now, this is even more impression, if you think that these magnets are over 20 tons than 20 tons -- and that have been moved by about 30 centimeters.
They are damaged about 50 magnets.
We had to take it to the point of it, what we did it.
We have it repristed and addition and adds.
These are now returning all of their under place under ground.
Entruth's late the LHC will be new integrat.
We accenge to accenate it to get to the jug, and we ways, and continuing so our wind or him, and continuing so our adventure to discover what the universe.
Now, of course, in a certain fairly the way of science and engineering the value of science and engineering. It's easy to confuture. It's easy to confuture.
I think that the fact that it's so difficult to go beyond the limits, I think it's the value of things like LHC.
I want to conclude with the words of a scientist Inglese, Humphrey Davy, what, imagine, in defense of his involved Michay, his pullo Michay, said, "No he's a lot of human mind as the science of the mind of the human mind as the science of the mind of the human mind that they are not in any new money that we are not in the same same day, and in nature that we are completely concluence in nature of nature,
Thank you.
I want to start asking you to rethink about here, by children, by a children, played matter to the morning.
While you understand how to get them and reach them and resolving them and resolving them and resolving them and resolving them and resolving and resolving relationships and skilling relationships and resolving them and resolving them and resolving them and resolving them and resolve them to think and resolve them to think about and resolving them and resolve them to be able to resolve them and resolve to be able to resolve them and resolve to resolve them and resolve them to resolve them and and resolve them to get them to resolve them and resolve them to resolve them to resolve them and ush and and and and re-
The space is deeply is deeply to understand the way part of the world around us.
So, by informing inspired by using the useching of our interaction with physics in my consults, and my collaboratory and my collaboratory and my collaboratory -- I started to ask mouse as a computer, rather than I just have the computer, instead of the mouse as a pastredigital that moves on on a now, the way of degital with both objects, and I can deal with both and yellow physically a physically a a a a a gyollotion with with bot,
and to put it to our please?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer to explore the answer to explore the answers.
In poor, a Siftable computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer in the bill.
In poor, a Siftable computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer in the bill.
You can move them with the hand, they can see it in them, they can feel the movement and have a wireless.
But more than the morning, are physics, like matter to be able to realize it.
The Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem of instruments to equququite information.
And as they become more physics, and I knew about the ways, of the others, and the others, and as they get more physics, and as they get more physics, of the others, of the otherwish of the interaction, we can explore and fun and fundamentally exploring new stiles of interaction.
I'm going to start with some simple example.
This Siftable is configured to show the video -- if it including it in a direction, the video it will go to the other part of the other part.
These interactive rituals are consciouss.
If they are interested in the fact that they are going to into.
If they come circumstom, they notice a little bit of a little bit of it.
If they come circumstom, they notice a little bit of a little bit of it.
They also have their movement and inclination.
We realized that one of the interesting interaction was the power to use gestures on the data, for example, "See to be a liquid.
In this case, we have three Siftable configurated as a green secks, and I can use them to be able to the colors in the centry, where they mix.
and I can use them to be a color in the centry, where they missing them in the centry, where they misse.
If we really get too much, we can get a little bit of place.
These are beautiful to learn about how language, like language, the mathematics and yiths of logics where people can try and see the results and see the immediately.
I'm --
This is a Fibonact that I do with a program.
So we have a game game is in the Scarabeum and Bogg.
Pratically, I got a literally house on every Siftable, Pratic, Pratic, Pratic, Pratic, in every Siftable, and while you try to get words out of a dition.
Then, after about 30 seconds remissing a new set of lectly skin and new possibility to try and new possibility to try to try to try to try to try to try to try and new possibility of the set.
Thank you.
Here's the kids came in the Middle Lab, I did it in a way that they tried to and I went to a video.
They are pleased in a lot of it.
And one of the interesting things of this kind of application is that you don't have to give many education of the instruments.
You just said, "Look about the words, and they know what to do.
So here is the other people who tried it.
This is our most young head, there is young in the right.
It actually wanted to make it implant.
They just were just morning for him.
Now, this is a application of a interactive cards.
We wanted to build a tool for the languages of Lui is Felix.
It can inserve new characters in the scene, to be slieved to the Siftable to the Siftable to the slightly associated.
It can inserve new characters in the scene, to be slieved to the Siftable to the Siftable to the slightly associated.
And that's doing using the sun.
Video: The sunger is smiling.
David Merrill: Now has taken a treat in the scen.
Video: The arancient is argue.
Bel work!
So I get the Siftable to get the skills and put the people in the characters --
Video: Bau!
-- by inventing the story.
Video: Ca!
DM: It's a story with open, and it can decide how they would.
DM: It's a story with open, and it can decide how they would.
Video: Vole, I live to it.
DM: The last example I have time to show you is a tool, realized to be a recently and exciting music.
it's a tool, recently, to the sampling music.
The Siftable here are in the south-based on the batteria.
Each one of these has four different variation of variation and you can choose what to use it.
You can get these sound sound to be able to get these sounds to be able to the please.
And to modified it just doing a sound and a "sound and a ""Death of a "sequence."
These are effects that you can control from live and the filter.
And the attacks to a particular sound to add it to add it to get it.
And then there are the general effects as time and volum, which you apply to the whole sequence.
Let's look like it works.
Video: D: We will start a base in two Sift-like like a two Sift-sequence, we system, we get to the extremely extremely other base.
Now I put a bassroom.
Video: DM: Now I get to the except --
Video: DM: And I'm going to put the bacteria, so I can control the effect of the bacteria.
Video: DM: I can fast the whole sequencing the whole sequencing time from one or the other.
Video: DM: And I'm going to add the movie to give more expression.
Video: DM: I can get the sequence the sequence to the fact to the fact to the fact to the fact to the fact to the fact to the fact to the fact to the facts.
So I don't have to planning it before, but I can try to make it more than to make it longer or more corty.
And now, finally, I can get the whole sequence, I can get the whole sequencing of the wind of the wild."
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is building new inside of men machine and more more more than our brain and cord.
And today, I had time to show you one of the results of this perfect and some possibility that we try to bring out of the lab to bring out of the lab to the lab in the lab of the results of this perfect and also some possible possible possible that we try to take out of the lab that
The concept I want to transmmeters to be this new generation of objects to interact with digital media to interact with digital media that we want.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the now to talk to all of you.
These are a writing writing.
Shcare of my professional books is more of these.
It's also love and the love of my life.
And I don't expect that can change it.
But I said that, something particularly happened in my life and in my career, and my career and in my career, which has taken me to realibring the whole reporting of work.
The particularly thing I recently written this book called "Mangia, Ama" called "Mangia, Ama," whatever from my previous -- for some reason in the world and became a big sensational reason in the world and became a big sense -- sellering interaction.
And the result is that everywhere from now, people are treating me as they were convicted.
It's true -- convicted, convict!
They are all worried and they all worried and they say, "You don't fear more to be able to do better?
You don't fear to continue to write all of life without able to make a book that can be able to create a book that can be able to make someone who is to importing somebody?"
that can be important to anybody?"
It's runcurbe, you know.
But it may go worse -- I think that I remember that more than 20 years ago, when I started to say people -- I was a adolescent -- I wanted to be a write write --
I met it at the same point by the wall.
And people say, "Don't do it in the next time to be success?
Don't you fear that the upon hand?
You don't fear to do this mester to do this mester of life, without any of the swimming on a heart of the sken basis of saving sets with the mesty of the slight?"
So you know.
The answer -- the short answer to all of these questions is, "Sy."
I think of all of those things.
I always had pauth.
And I also fear of many other things that people may not to ine.
As a high-and other things things --
But as I think about what I would write what I thought and ask me to be ultimally because it is it because it is?
Is it it is it?
It's logical that everybody who needs to be expected by a work that you feel to do it.
But what is that particular in the impreses creative to make us to make us nervous health mind other than carrier in a way that other carrier doesn't do?
How my father, for example, he was a engineer and I don't remember one time in his 40 years of the activity where the clear, if it was asked to be engineer if it was asked to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer than one has a money in its own own own own there,
There was no -- that that the engineer engineer John, how w?
It didn't work, that it doesn't work,
Onestly, the engineers as group as group as group don't have certainly in the century, the reputation of being equid eacuries to be able to resive.
We have enough of this reputation, and not only about the writers but creative creative of every general reputation of any general reputation of being enormously instable.
And it's not rest that you look at the trister of the diaths of magnific magnitude in the windner of the magnitution of young diseases to them.
And the people who don't have suicide sound like being really, by their women.
Norman Mailer, before I was going to die, in the last of the interview said, "Ogny book me a little more." One extraordinary result."
But we don't go out of the way when we feel these things so long as we heard these things that long as we were completely interior somehow we were completely interior to be able to be able to be able to get to some way and the art of the rest of the angood, connecting it will always be a clue.
And the question I want to ask all of all of this is -- what are you agree with this ideas?
It goes es to be this -- because it looks like a centimeter of me is not good for anything that supposed to anything that supposed to do anything like this supposed to anything -- because it is not good for anything -- because it looks like me not good for anything -- because it looks like me -- because it looks like it doesn't good for anything that -- because it is not good for for anything that -- because it is not good for anything that --
I think it's hodious.
And I think it's dangangerous, and I don't want to see it in the next century.
I think it's better to encouraging our big minds creative to live.
And I know that, in my case -- in my case -- in my situation -- would be very dangerough to the dark up to the situation in my charria.
It's true -- it looks at it, I'm quite young -- I have about 40 years.
I still have about four decade of work in me.
And it's very likely anything write that anything to write from the world as the work that was going to be right from the work that was going to be successful for my last book.
I'm going to be slavery, because we are all more or less friends here -- it's likely to my greatest success is to my shoulder.
Oh, Gesus, that I think!
You know this is the kind of though, that is the person to get a person to start to begin to the nine morning, and I don't want to do it.
I would continue to do this work that we do with this work that I do.
So, the question becomes from?
And so I seed up after a lot of reflectic to keep writing to continue to try to make a psychological cool, ok?
I have to find a distance of sure of me, which I'm writing to be able to write, and my natural react that I was written to get E, while I was trying to get to look for all last year, as I started looking through the time to look through the time, trying to find out whether they could have some other societies to see if they could have the best ideas to see if they could have the best ideas and seadows and
about how creative people to help people to make the inerent inerents of creativity.
And that research has taken me to the ancient and Roma.
Seguith because I turned out to certain and then back.
In the ancient Greea and Rome -- people don't seem to believe that creativity came from human, OK?
It was thinking that creativity was this spirit about and that they come to the wine and unknown to a few amount of the source and unknown and unknown away and unknown aways.
They were called these diving diving of the creativity of the creativity of the demonior.
Socrat, wonderful of course, it was a demon that elargives sweet.
Romans were in the same idea, but they call that kind of spirit without cord a genius.
The thing is great because the Romans didn't think that a genius was someone particularly smart.
They believed that a genius was this kind of a diving genius that you believe in the walls of the studio of a artist, a little bit like Dobby, and that was selling up to hide the work of the artist of the job's work.
Excycle -- that's the distance of which I mean, that psychological struction -- that psychological struction that you protect you from your work.
And everyone knew that was so that it was so that he worked, right?
So the anti-year-old artists were protecting things, like the too narcism, now?
If your work was exceptional is not to take all the market, everything that was helped by this incorporate genius.
If your work fally, it was not all of your job?
All they knew that was your genius to be a incapace.
And so people have conceived the creativity in Occcide for a very time.
Then the Rinacicise came and all of this big idea; we put this big idea; we put the human being to the middle of the universe and no longer to the creatures and no leaving space to the creatures that they write from divinity.
This was the rather of the rational human eximution and people start thinking that creativity came completely from ispring.
And for the first time in history, I began to referred this or one that artist as a genius like a genius with genius.
And I have to tell you that was a big error herror.
I think that allowing someone simple person to believe to be like a recipe of being like a recipe of all my mysteries and the surprising of all my inknown and ethern responsibility to be a film or too big film to be a film or too big, and ethern the psyches that are too big to be a record to to the psycharge, and ethern in the psychoooes of the source
It's like to ask someone of the sun.
Deform and historically, the ego and creates all these expectations on the performance.
And I think this pression to have the art artists in the past 500 years.
And if this is true, and I think it is the question, and I ask it to the question, and now?
We can do it different?
Maybe I can go back to a more ancient understanding of the relationship between human and creative creative creativity.
Or maybe no.
Maybe we can't cancelling 500 years of rational thinking about a raational talk.
And it probably there is people in the audience that would be ready to read scientific suspects, you know, they follow the people who following successful fairly on the soulders of the scientific needs to make their projects.
I probably don't think I will start all of you on this thing.
But the question I want to ask is -- why is -- why is it -- why is it -- why is it -- why is it -- why is it -- why is it -- why is it -- why is it?
Why don't think it in this way?
Because it has more sense of every other thing that I ever heard to explain the exasperant imprevedibilities of creative process.
A process that we have ever trying to do something -- so much of doing something -- so much fundamentally, all of the way, all of here -- yet, you don't get rectionally.
And, in fact, it can sometimes it seems completely paranormal seems completely paranormal seems completely paranormal seems completely paranormal seem.
I did this meeting recently with the extraordinary poeter Ruth Stone, who has 90 years, but that was a poet, but that was a poet, and he said that during his childhood in the Virginia, working out in the came, and I feel it was the walks, and I feel the winger that was the revenue of the counter --
He said it was like a type trene.
And that was going to get rolling to her landscape.
It was going to be able to get the ground under his feet.
It knew to have one of that is one of that and it was telling it was a little bit of a morning, "corrupt like a morning.
And so it goes to come home and wouldn't have to be followed by this poet, and it should be able to take a paper and a fasty piece of paper and a da, while training it and relight.
Other times es could be enough fasty and corrective and correctly and correctly record and he would get to roll through and she was going to get through and she would have to rolled through the countrys' counter, trying to go through the countrage, and he would have been trying to get through the country."
Then there were those times -- this piece of time -- this piece of time -- there were moments in which the almost lose was almost lose almost lose lose --
So, he was running at home and was trying to card and the poetry was looking for the poet, and he was going to be a math in the women, and then he said, it was like like it was going to be as if you get away with the other hand the off.
He was the poetry from the codle and he was the poeters, and he was the rope and the payer in the body and the payer.
And in these cases, the poetry would be presented on the perfect and intact page and intact to the first -- the last word to the first before.
So when I felt it -- it's crazy exactly the way.
Not all my creative process -- I'm not a convict!
I'm a mule, and my way to work is to work is to see me at the same horary every day, and to work and work on and go up and go up and go up and go up and go up and go up and go up and go up and go up and go up and go up and go up and go up and go up and get up and go up and go up and go up and get up and go on and go up and get up and go up and work on and work on and work on the goodly.
But even I wish my textboard, I realized that thing,
And I guess that also many of you have a fact.
You know, even if the work and ideas and ideas and ideas they come up with a certain source.
And what is this thing?
And how can we relate to us to do not to let us to lose the textboun, that we do to remaining sani?
And as I really, the best example of the example I have is Tom Waits, which I interviewed different years ago for a day.
We were talking about this, and you know, Tom, and you know, Tom, for the major of life was the incarnation of the artist of the artist of the clean to control -- to seeing these species of the creatives that to be injugmented by the time to be involved by the way,
But then he was driving up and a day, and a day, and a day, and a day away from the autotig, he changed all for him.
He was going to go fast, and all of a tract tract of this melodia, which comes in his head as the inspiration, and elusive and engineering, and the wants to know -- and the desire and wish wish and the desire wish and the desire to take it.
It doesn't have a paper piece of paper doesn't have a matheme matter.
So it begins to feel this kind of old old old old old is to grow up in him and I can get to lose and hossessioned by this song, and I can get to be able to feel.
I'm not enough good enough and I can't do it cel."
And instead of go to the panic stop --
I'm going to put the whole process and it made something completely new thing.
And he said, "Scusa, and he said, "Scusa, you can't see that I'm driving I'm driving that I'm driving I just driving the sky of the sky and said, "See I just see that I'm driving the sky of the sky and he said, "Scusa, you see that I'm just driving the sky of I'm driving the sky of I'm driving the sky of the sky and said, "Scusa, you know, I'm going to look at the sky
"To you seems that can write a song what?
If you really want to exist, it will be a more opportunity when I can take care of you.
Altriments, I woulder, I walked to anyone else today.
You can disturbing Leonard Cohen."
And his working changed by this.
Not the work was still as dark as it seeds.
But the process, and the fish that was released when the genius, the genius, the genius that was out of the other than I would have to be a whole thing else and relibered back where they came up with the came to come from coming to come from coming to come from the interior and mented it was going to be an interior and returned back and mented it was that they were going to be a whole thing and returned out out to be a whole thing and they realized and remove to the
but well, it won't be a great conversation between Tom and a conversation between Tom and this extremely and this external thing that was location.
So I was feel that I was going to change a little bit as I worked and saved a little bit of a flying time.
This idea, I was saving when I was writing "Mangia, Ama, and I fall of one of those hundred of the disperation of the disperation where we all of them when we were working on something and you start thinking that it will be a disaster that that that that that that that that that that that that that the worst will be the worst of the job, and he was going to be a books.
Not just bad worst right book written to written it.
And I started thinking about designing this project.
But then I remembered Tom that I talked to the air and try to do.
So I was a high-hand-written and I would say, my comments to a corner of the room.
And I said, "You know, both you know, both that if this book don't be brilliant that if this book doesn't be brilliant not going to be brilliant, right?
Because as I can see what I am I'm going to do I haven't more than that.
So if you want it to press you to press you and make your parts.
OK. But if you don't do it, I don't know it is a cold thing, I don't have quite quite quite it.
I'm going to writing the same because it's my work.
And I want to want to flew that I today today I today today I presented to my part, because of the end is -- at the end of Africa in the deserts of Africa, and the people were rather for the dances of the long dances and the sacred and the sacred to the dance of the mosacred that they were going to the hours and the hours that they were going to sacross to the hours and the hours of the sacred in the deserts of the sacross the dance of people who were going to st
And they were always magnized, because the balls were professionists and they were fantastic.
But every tonly, something happened, and one of these artists became to be actually translated in fact,
And I know what I know about why I know that the view all of the point, a lose performance like that.
It was like time well as a walking cross a ball, and the ball, and the walking in different species of the land-up and it was not doing anything that was happening to the sun, but all of all of it was going to be a lot of different --
And suddenly not just as a human human one.
But it turns out of the below and under the divinity of the divinity.
And when this happen, the people who knew what was going to call it with his names to his names --
They were the hands and they were began to sant, "Allah Dooh God, God, God, God, God, God, God,
That's God, you know.
And he has been taking a storics -- when the Morors invaded the south of the Spna, they took this and pronune in the centuries from "Ah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Ah, ah, Ah," which you can still feel in the corride or in the corrids or in the flew or in the flew of the corrids or in the flew of the corrids of the Spner of the south of the south of the Spattern.
In Spana, when a artist has made something impossible and the magic -- and oh, oh, oh, well, magny, burow, bad -- -- a scor, except -- a scor.
And it's big because we need.
But the issue is the next day, for the ball, when you get away and discovered that they are the 11 morning, and discovered that they are the 11 of Marteducation is not more.
It's just a mortal mortal with the knews and maybe not going to be able to see that alteen.
And perhaps no one will dog the name of God while and what do is the rest of his life?
It's hard to spread.
This is one of the most dolorous reciliation to make a creative life.
But perhaps not to be so angood-force approach, if you can not believe it, that the most expects of your being come from you to yourself to be as a extraordinary as you can be as a extraordinary to be so angood.
But believe it just that you get from a in-in-fount imaginable to be a source of this squist part of your life that you have to go to someone else when you find.
And, you know, if we think in this whole whole whole change.
And so I started thinking about it, and it's sure as I thought for different months in the book working on the book that I would have to be able to assure that I'm going to be a dangerous, dangerous, exactly dangerous,
And what I have to keep when I feel electric I feel electric to be pauth.
I don't get it. I don't have to be it.
It turns out to presenting you to your party, whatever can it.
If your work is ball, it ball.
If the windn, I measure to leave some kind of wonderful to leave some kind of wonderful time through your beautiful time through your effort to your heavy and "Ole!"
Altriments, you know, you do the same dance.
And "Ole!" to yourself it.
I think we have to teach us to teach it.
"Ole!" to you, even for you, just for the human love and textboard and textboard to represent.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
As you know I've talked about some of these projects on the human genome genome of these projects on what it can meaning and discoveries of genes.
Now we're starting a new lock: we started to start digitalizing biology and now to go from that code code that we are entering in a new fase of biology, designing and synthesizing and synthesizing life.
We always tried to take big questions.
"What is the life? It's something that many biology have so many biologists to understand various levels.
We tried to have different approach, reduced it to the minimum minimum of the terms.
We're digitalizing from almost 20 years hours.
When we sequenced the human genome was going to go from the analogic world.
Now we ask us -- we can regenerate life, or create new life from this digital?
This is the map of a little organism, Mycoplasma genome -- which is the smallest species from the smallest genome of the smallest genome of the genome of the little bit between those that can authoref.
And we tried to reduce the genome of the genome to create a smaller.
We are able to eliminate a hundred genes of the about 500 that are here.
But when we look at the methabolic map metabolic map, it's very simple respect to the now.
And that's simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can elimine, a very imlikely that this can bring it to a vidence that this can bring it to a vivent.
So we decided that the only way to progress to progression was synthesize this crumbble to move some of these questions.
And so we started the wind of the "Possetize a cromother?"
Can chemistry consequence of producing these big molecules that we never have been able to create before?
And in case of case -- we can do a cromosom cross?
A cromosome is just a piece of inerts.
The speed that we are able to digitalize life is growing up to exponential exponential exponential speed to be exponential speed.
Our ability to write the genetic code of genetic code -- rather ther deartly but it's better than that.
And our most recently results the results the exponential curve.
We started over 15 years ago.
The process has requires a lot of pass to a biothic review before we started the first experiments.
But we discovered that synthesize DNA is very difficult.
There are thousands of cars to the world that they make small segments of DNA, of the long-and-and-up degeneration degeneration of 30 to 50 to get out of the skin is longer than the segment.
So we have to develop a new metom to assemble to assemble these fragments and correct the errors.
And this was our first tent, particularly from information of Phi genome of Phi 174.
It's a little virus that kills killing bacteria.
We have designed the fragments, effect of the errors and got a molecule of DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters.
The interesting part is when we took this piece of inert material and we put it in the bacterial bages, the bacterial code and to read this genetic code and producing the viral particles.
The viral particles are then released by cellules, are back and they have the cellules, they have the E.
I talked about recently with recently oil industry members that they have certainly understanding this model.
They have more than you.
We believe that this is a situation that software can actually build his own hardware in a biological system.
But we wanted to do things in big things.
We wanted to build the whole chromosome.
These are more than 580 milar code code code code of genetic code code of genetic code code of genetic code code of genetic code code --
So we thought about built it in cassets of virus, so that we can change the cassets to understand what the cassets are the components of a vivent.
The projecation is critical crucial information in a computer, these have to be very accurated.
When we sequence, we sequence, in 1995 the accurate was a standard for every 10 mibasic accurate for every 10 mibasic mibasis.
We found it recently, 30 errors. If we were used that the original sequence, we never were able to do it in the original sequence.
A part of the process is to designing segments that you get to the recognizing with all other seats of the 50 lectures to build under unity,
We do a elements of one until here.
You probably read that we read the cluster of the phylie.
Think about it. We have a genetic code genetic code on four liter: A, C, and T.
Three of those lectures codified about 20 friends, and there is a specific order to be able to put for every friendly load.
So we can use the genetic code to write words, though though.
What we did at at the beginning is automated.
Some of the fact that it wasn't poeken from the fact that it wasn't poek.
We have designed these segments for just to uniquely uniquely with the entire things.
There are huge as wells them and put them and put them to asthise.
And we started assembling the particularly segments from five to set to set up with seat, until seats to 24 milecture of the 24 milectly letter to get to 72 miles.
We spend every step we produced these segments in fact that we have to sequence, so that we're trying to create a extremely robuster -- as you'll see in a minute.
We're trying to automatize the process.
So, this looks like a basis of a basket.
When we are going to get these very long long segments, more than 100 miles -- more than 100 miles -- they will not grow more directly in E.
You get to the limits tools of the modern biology.
So we consider other mechanisms.
We knew about another mechanism called recombination called recombination of omologists to repeaking DNA to deal with the seat.
Here's an example.
This organism, called Deinococcus radioduring three million radioduring three million radiation of radiation.
You can see in the sound as his cromosomes like his cromosome.
In 12 -- 24 hours is reassembled exactly as before.
They were thousands of organisms that are able to do it.
These organisms can be completely sected.
They can live under it.
They're absolutely certain life existing in space, and you move new environments of water.
In the true, NASA showed that this avenough.
This is a picture of the molecules we built using these process, just using these process, just using the design design appropriate designed by the sath of the seat.
The lilievised them already to the automatically
This image was not taken with a microscope with a electronic microscope with a microscope rule.
It's a molecule, so that we can see it with a microscope with a microscope.
These are pictures that covered a period of about six seconds.
This is the published that we did a little time ago.
These are more than 58,000 genetic code code genetic code code of genetic code --
It's the largest molecules that we have ever created by the man who created by man.
It has a fish molecular on a 300 million of them.
If we walk it with a 10 careatter of 10 without spaces, there would like to get 142 pages to just move this genetic code this code code of a genetic code of a genetic code of 10 pages to get 142 pages to just move this genetic code of a types that code genetic code of this genetic code that genetic code this gen
Now, how do we do it work? How can we activate it?
Of course, we tracked a virus is a girl.
It's a little more complicated when they use batter.
It's more simpler than the eucariot of how our net: you can just exctly ext to be the nucleus and enserve a high, which is basically the process of clonation.
In the bacterial archaea cymosome, is instead of cellule, but we recently recently that we are able to do a complete trapiece of a crum, and we have recently from a cell cell by a cell of active cell phone and activate it to another and activate it.
We can have a cromosomes from a microbial species of a microbial species.
The two are different are different than the men of topis.
We have added some gene gene in a way to decide what choosing to chromosom for this cromother.
The slight with the gases to killing all the proteins.
And when we put it in the cell is stupend -- and you open our softwo-physticatos -- the new cell is going to go into the cell phone.
And we were thinking we wouldn't go old, but we have a lot of communicates more in there.
This is one of the most extremely mechanisms of evolution.
We found that many species have a second or a second or a third or a third of a few hundreds of new tracks, add thousands of new tracks.
So who thinks about evolution as a gene to the gene that it doesn't understand part of the biology.
They were in the garms called the recipe of recipture is that degerish the DNA.
The chromosomes that was in the cell doesn't get one.
The cellula-the cromosomes that we insert --
It's expressed and recognized the other cromosome, has masticate, has masticary, and we recognized with only the crum.
it's became blue of the genes we have insert.
And in a short lass of time, all the characteristics of a kind of game, and it turned out of the new species, and it turned into the new software that we put in the cell.
All the proteins are changed, the membrans are changed, and when we read the genetic code genetic code genetic code of the equivalent that we transferred you.
Now, this may seem alterms alterms but altering the software DNA we can change things in the enough waste enough support.
Now, I explain that you don't talk about genesis -- but of progress from three million years from three million years of evolution, and I said that maybe we're going to make a new version of the explosion of Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosion of this digital process of this digital process.
Why do I do that?
I think it's obvious enough when we think about our need to think about our essity.
We're going to spend six billion and a half of nine billion in the next 40 years.
I am to give an example: I was born in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for each other, in 1940 years, there are 40 years, there are going to be four years, there are are going to be four years,
We're doing problems now now to find food and clean water and clean and clean and bons and bad and a half billion people.
It will be more during us.
We get more than five billion carbon of olide -- more than 30 billion bar.
That means a hundred million bars to a day.
When we try to find biological processes or any kind of process to replace to replace them, it will be a huge challenge to be a huge challenge to be a challenge.
And in the most of the CO2 emission of CO2 emission of these materials that finishing in the atmosphere.
At day, thank you to the scientific discoveries in the world, we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I like to think that they are designed for the future.
The electronic industry it is just a dozen about component, and think about how many different things are coming out.
Our limits here are main principlely by biological reality and our imagination.
Now we have the techniques, thank you very quickly to these metod-rapids, able to create what we call genomics combined.
We are able to build a big robots that can produce a robots that can make a big room of a billion cromosomes.
Think of process these 20 different genes of different genes or to try to optimize the processing processing to make a little bunch or drugs, we can change and a little team, and create more biology team, and create biology now that in the last 20 years.
And it's just a standard section of standard.
We can chemistry for the chemistry of survival or chemistry, chemistry, prodution of vaccines to the vaccines of vaccines --
This is a few software programmed some software programmed to be able to set and designing species to set and designing species to set and designing species to so.
Well, we don't know necessarily as they will be no.
We know exactly what their genetic code code of it.
Now we're focus on the focusing carbon of quarter generation.
You also saw you that you extract out of the gran experiment was a mal.
We have a further than the second generation that will use enough pretty much rather than slow dallaging as much as wall-value or fun or different types of butanol.
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without increasing major major more than food and limiting the opening of food and availability would be to transforming CO2 in matter that we are working for cells to design cells that can reach cells that can reach this discoveries of quarter fly in about 18 months.
The sunlight with CO2 is a methodom -- but in our discoveries in our world, we've found different metodies.
This is a organism that we described in 1996.
It lives in the ocean deep in the ocean deep foundity to the temperature of the water.
It puts from CO2 using hydrogen molecular as a source of energy.
We're trying to understand if we can make CO2, which can easily be transported by tramite tub, to convert that CO2 in the carbon to drive this process.
So short we think that we might be able to increase what the basic question, "What is the real life, truth, we have the modest goal to replace the oil.
And if you don't do it from TED, where you can do it from TED, where you can do it from TED, where you can do it from TED, where you can do it from TED, where you can do it from TED, where you can do it from TED, where you can do it from TED, where you can do it from TED, where you can do it from TED, where you can do it from TED, where you can do it from TED, where you can do it from TED, where you can do it from TED, where you can do it from the TED, where
It would become a main principle source of energy.
And yet, we're working for using the same metohot to create vaccines of instants.
You've seen this year with the influence, we are always back, and a dollars in a year and a dollars in a dollar and a just.
I think that that that it can change building vaccines in the ancient vaccinable in the ancient ance.
That's how the future might start to change it seems to change it, now, the tree of evolution, acceling the evolution with synthetics, and ended cells.
We're so so much to the people.
Our purpose is to live enough to try to make it very much to try to do it. Thank you very much.
First of all I will see the most quicker possible work in the world that we have been able to the Microsoft in the Microsoft in the following water in the following watch.
It's a environment that you can interact is to interact with a huge quantities that remote with a huge amount of visual data --
We're seeing a lot of gabytotally gives you a lot of the digital zoom and continuous fast, for a speed panor, to be panoreasy for the images as we want.
And it doesn't matter how big the amount of information that we see, as big as we see, or images.
Most is a digital photographs -- but this for example is a scansion from Bilibrary of Congress: and reaching in the gamma of 300 megape of 300 megather.
It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that limits its the patterns of a system like this is the number of pixel on your screening architecture.
This is a book book -- for examples of data not images.
This is the Casa desolated, the Dickens. Every cool bound.
To show you that it is textbooks and not imagine, we can make a thing of the representation of the representation of the textbook, not a photo.
It may be a little bit of a little bit to read electronic book a book electronic book a little bit of electronic book a book for a electronic book a little bit of electronic book a little bit of electronic book a blood.
It's not considered.
This is a more realistic example of the Guardian number of the Guardian.
Every image is the beginning of a section.
And it will really give you the pleasure and the beautiful experience of a view or a quotidline or of a quotidy of a quotidly.
We also did something with the corner of this number of Guardian corner of the Guardian.
We created a published by the way, more than resolution -- much higher than what you use in a normal publish.
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile, you can see here.
Or other models, or even specific specific and techniques.
And this really demonstrates of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on the screen.
We hope that this means to put up and other porks, and other porks, and other porkeries like to have to be necessarily to be necessary.
Of course, the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology.
And I don't want to lose time, if not to say that we have contributes to give it in this field.
These are all the roads in the USA. obobject image of NASA.
So we go to something else.
This is actually actually from the websk; you can go to the webso.
It's a project called Photosynth, which combine two different technology.
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual research, in a very interesting reward of Noah Seadragon-See students of Washington, with the aid of Seitzeliski Seitzeliski Research. Szeliski Research. Se'd collaboration.
And it's from the viewing of the web, gestry.
You can see it when we do this is where we can go from one image of the screen to another image of the image of the multiple experience.
But the space of space images here has actually a meaningful meaning.
The computer algorithms of visualization of the computer have these images together together and they correspond to the real slides that imagined -- all the neighborhood in the Grashes on the Montags -- have been taken canadies -- have been taken canadies or a slide-showed the slide-shows of the slide-showed space.
I don't know if I have time to show you some other environment.
There are a lot more space space in the space of space
I want to spend the one of the original data set of Noah-- and this is from a previous protynth of Photosynth that we have done to work for the first time the first time the last time -- to show you what I think is truily the key to show what I think about the technology, the technology, the technology, the technology, the technology that we have put in the web.
We had to worry about the legal ways.
This is a rebuilding in the critical rebuilding in Notare Dame images from Flickr. Basta digitate Dame in Flickr and you get images of the types in the major images of these guys and they saw up with the sampled picture that you have a picture that you have an image image that it's just just a picture that it's discoveries that you can see a picture that it's appears to do it.
So I'm all the pictures from Flickr and have been colleged in space in this way.
And it's possible to navigate in this simple way of us.
You know, I never had to work for Microsoft.
It's very gratification to get this kind of accool.
I think you can see that it's a lot of different types of different types of fun photos to those phones in the professional phones SLR, a number of meaningful foundation in this environment.
And if you can try to try to try to try to look at the strange.
These are blocks, etc.
And in the way, it is a series of photographs -- except of photographs and -- etcol.
This is a placer of Notare Dam's correctly.
We can go from the placer to the physics of this environment.
The essential point is that we can do things with the social environment. This is taking from all of the internal memory of how to appear the view, and it college point from view, and it college all those data together.
All of those pictures become colleged together, most of the similes.
You've got a model of the land that emerge.
Think about this as a long time of the work of Stephen Lawler on Earth
It's something that is that it is growing in complexity as people using it, and the vantages for the us.
Their pictures are marched with other people.
If someone is the idea of contrash all these many of these things that are telling the name of Notare of Notare of Notare suddenly arrichs of all those data, and I can use the way of engineering for the engineering photograph, and have an experience experience of the crossmoke in the middle of the kind of crossmooths and crossmoke and crossmooth.
Of course, a consequence of all of that are extremely elaborated virtual model, not only from the Earth, and by the images and by the images and similar images and similar to the collective.
Thank you very much.
CA: I understood understood well? What your software that your software going to be able to do is that for a certain year, all the photographs and shared by anyone in the world in the whole world will be practically colleague, are going to be practically colleage?
BA: Yeah. What is doing is doing it is to discover it.
It's creating the hyperlin, if you want to be like in images.
And it's doing it in the bottom of the images.
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the weiths of information that many of these images that many of these images can except images that many of these images can have it.
As when you make a research of images on the web, you give a sentence and the head has a lot of information about the pictures of the pictures of the pictures of the picture.
Now, what happens if that picture is college all of your picture?
So the amount of interconnection and the amount of seeds and the recycle of the retest that is really enormous effect of the net.
CA: Blaise, it's really incredible.
BAA: You thank you very much.
One of the principal pleases when you travel and one of the etho's research is the power of the ethrows in the wind of the anti-tradition-rail, the touching pioes in the wind of the place -- the piogy is in the floor.
Bast's thinking that slightly slide Jaguar is still beyond the Way, or that the myths are still hyths are still meaningful meaningful meant or that in Himalaya, the buddy ya, to remember, to remembering the importance of the anthropologia, which we are not existed in sense of the anthropologia, but is just a model of reality, but it's just a model of the reality of reality, but it's just a a model of the reality of the cropologist,
the consequence of a particular choices of adaptations that our stirps of adaptops or malmost like a lot of generations ago.
And, of course, we all share of essential tracts.
We all all of it. We all procreise we procreight.
We are dream of the beginning of the beginning.
We have to deal the inexorability of morting, so we don't surprising us and ballim --
we have a art.
What you have is the particular of the charg, the ritof the dance of every culture.
Not matter that they are the Curan Eart's Does of the Voodoum of Haiti, or the Haiti, or the Kair in the Kaise in the Kaise of Abong, or a camel, or a camelider, or a camel.
He was my journey of journey in the desert a month ago, or a month ago, or a yak in yak in the walls of the Everest, the demother of the world.
All of these populations teaching us that there are other ways of thinking, other ways of thinking, other ways of thinking, other ways of thinking, other ways of thinking, other ways of thinking, other ways of thinking, other ways of thinking, other ways of thinking, other ways of thinking, other ways of thinking, other ways of thinking to be able to think about it, other ways of thinking, other ways of thinking, other ways of thinking, other ways of thinking, other ways of thinking, other ways of thinking, other ways of thinking, other ways of existing motion
And, if you reflect a concept that can give you hope.
Inside, my miries of cultures of the world create a ragnatela of spiritual and cultural and cultural and cultural to be as important as a biosphering biological biophizing biological biophers.
And you can think about this rather cultural as a cultural ethnose as a nice and you can define the ethoal ethoal ethol of all the conceptions, inspirations, inspirations, inspirations, inspired by the consciousness of the consciousness of the consciousness.
The ethnos: The fantastic patrimonurimon.
It's the symbol of what we are and what we can be in as a species of what we can be in how inquisist species of what we can be in the species of what we can be in as a species of what we can be in as a species of what we can be in as a inquisitive.
And as the biosphere was free to be consumed by higher point, as we have a lot more quicker and purposes --
No biologist, for example, it would tell 50-percent of all the species is about the extinction of the extinction -- in the most apocality, or in the most apocalitics -- and not near the popular popular -- and not near the popular popular -- that of cultural diversity -- that of cultural diversity -- that of the cultural diversity -- that is the size of the cultural diversity of the biological diversity --
The indicates of all of the language.
When you're borns were 6,000 languages on this planet.
One language is not just by a vocabulary or from a series of the gram of the gram rules.
One is the language of human spirit spirit of human spirit spirit of human spirit spirit of human spirit spirit is the human spirit of human spirit spiri.
It's the meeting with the animation of every culture goes in the material world.
English is a forest of the mind, a wink, a thinking, a though thought, a spiritual system of spiritual chance system.
And of those 6,000 language, while we are here in Monterey, at least the half is not sussurrounded in the orecks.
They don't get more teached to the children, which means not walked to be walked to be a lot of times as they did.
What is more trister than being flight from the silent to be the last to talk about the last to the language of the last to be the wisdom or to be the same as wisdom or to the promise of the kids?
This is a fairly states somewhere in some part of every two weeks of a few weeks a mother and brings a write and with switch to the last last few weeks of a ancient language.
And I know someone of you will tell "It's not better than this?
The world would not be a better place if we all all the same language?" Benisy; we talk about all yoruba.
We talk about kogi.
You'll be able to tell a tract of what it doesn't tell your language.
I would like to do a journey through the eference --
a little journey in the etnose of what we're loging is that we are loging.
Many of us forget that when I say that when I say, "different ways of existing existing very different ways of exist.
We take for example this bimbo Baras, in Amazonia, in Amazonian population of the anaconda, which creates to the mixing of the milar sacridge of the best sacridge of the pents of the sacridge of the pattern.
It's a popular popular that it's not able to distinguisn't to distinguish the blue of the blue -- because the time the slightly popular popular popule.

The young people have been taken from the family to three or four years, and they live in a world of good and they live in a world and they live in a glaciers to the base for 18 years.

So all of this time, they get acculated to the values of their values that they predict their pregame and only their pregame and only their praying to the balance.
At the terms of this incredible beginning out and suddenly carried out and for the first time in the age of 18 years, they see a him at the age of the first cut, when the suntil wrong, when the suntil wrong, and the suntil of the beautiful beautiful works. The pretty much of the beautiful workers.
"Do you say this? I said, "How I said,

This level of intuition is extremely important.
When we think about the population population and the environment of the environment history of the sunnable story of the noble history or maybe we ask Thoreat, and we say that these popules are close to the Earth of Ter's population of us.
The indigenes are not sentency is not feeling to the sentency of our algies.

What is interesting is the metaphor, which defines the metaphor, and natural world.
I grew up in the forests of the British creating that the forests of the British creating that the service.
And he realized me to be different from my friends Kway-wide-making friends that the forests are the Hukukuk and the write of Hukukukuk and the dogs that live to the exthrowing in the world, spirits that live in the Hamatsa.
If you start to consider that these cultures can create different reality of different discoveries of their sense of sensationality. We take this plant. We take this plant.
I took this picture to open the normouth Amazonidental Amazonidental Amazonidental Amazonished this picture.
Maybe some of you have heard about the ayaxis -- the most powerful poundent of the slips of the slightly psychoice.
What makes it fascinating the ayaxis is not the potential to the macological potential of the sustance, but his elaboration.
On one side, this liana lian that conties of beta-carbolins, harmine and harmly harin-mine bounds, slightly hallucinot and hardly hallucinot and harmly hallucinot of betah --

To that policy on the hidden is a little bit like being sparated by a smoky pins and landing on a matter of electricity. It creates a matter of the reality of real-creates the dissolution of the reality of reality.
I was often with my professor, Richard Evan Shultes, the man who has been psychedelic, with his psychedelic, with his psychedelics in Mexico.
Second my type you can classified these triptams like hallucinogens because if you're done to be able to tell anybody of being about. The triamong, but they can be sleept for a horse because they are money to be absolutely in the extinct of the world's involved worlox.
It's possible to assumers only if I sumptions with other sustances that money with other chemicals that are the MAO.
Now it's the beautiful beta-carbon is that you find in this liana are inbitors of MAO, of the same kind of needs to potentiate tripty tripty to potentially -- in a flew of 80,000 species of plants, like they do in this ways. But if you can get two morphologological mormorphologically not similar to the square that we going to be a version that is sum to the particular one of the particular thing?
We use the great euphyemism and the error, which can reveal to be revealed to be using it.
But if we ask to the Indians, they will tell us "The plants speak to us."
What do you want to say it?
This tribe, Cofan, 17 varieties of ayaxxis that they were born in the forest, which is born in the forest, and that we would get in the same species.
If we ask them how to stablish their tassonomy will tell us "I thought I was not knowing how much plant, I realized it "No."
The solution is -- they take 17 varieties in a night of a plena and each other.
And in this is not using us to Harvard, but it's much more interesting than counting the stames.
Now, the problem is that the problems is that the people who have heart the people who have heart the popular popules that are pitches and some way to the margin our real world.
In fact the X-century, between 300 years, not true for the wars or or the sounds or the innovation of technological innovation and we have stopped and we have been making in the major accepted the mass of biological diversity and cultural diological diversity of biological diversity of biological diversity and cultural isn't the change.
All the cultures through the century of the involved in a dance for new possibilities of life.
And the issue is not technology.
Indians Sioux doesn't stop being Sioux when they put it from arch and frecked up and frecked up and frecked up and head.
It's not the change or technology that they threat the integrity of the ethnow.
The during the domination.
And if you give a skin the world, you will discover that these are not cultures that these are not destined to disappear.
These are creatures and dynamics are being being dynamics out of identifiable forces that are beyond their ability to adaptary.
And it's going to be able to disboxing in the patria of the guys --
a popular population of Sarawak, in the south of the asian population that has vised live in the forest forest to a generation age, and now reduced to the service and the prostitution of the river, where you can see the river, where you can see the river, where the book's honges in the Meridiontons are the orizontons of Meridionty Caraways,
pronive styles with the inner tract with the forest.
Or in the case of the Yanomams, are the diseases that are coming with the discovered by the hour.
If we move on the Tbetter, where I'm doing a lot of research where I'm doing a lot of research of politics.
As the genocide of the genocide of a popular popul, is condded to universal level of a popular popular level of a popular popular popular environment, not only is convicted in certain the environment, because part of the developing of developing the developing of developing world.
And you can't understand the suffering suffering of Tibet until you get out of the beginning.
I took 6,000 miles from Chinese Chinese Chinese Cina in Western Cina in the Western Tibet with a young young in Lasa young in Lasa I realized the statistics that we were talking about.
6,000 world-sacred sacred sacred and ceneres.
1.2 million people killed by the military Rvolution in Cultural Rvolution in Cultual Rvolution in Cultural Rvolution of the military Rvolution in the Culture.
The dad of this guy is ascritten in Panchen Lama.

Huncle is coming with Sua Santity in Santity during the diaspora that has taked the population in Nepal.
The mother was imprisoned and his color was rected.
It was taken to hidden in the age of two years of the two years of hidden in the half of her gonna because it may live without of him.
The sister, which has done it was messed in the field of reeducation.
A day, he was very hot a jumped fascia raffiling Mao for this transgression was messed for seven years.
Tibet of Tibet can be ununable, but the spirit of the population of the population is from tend to tend to be un-present.
And so it turns out to a choice.
We want to live in the world, the world's world's world's world or we want to get the policy-world world policy?
The great anthropologioga Margaret Mead, before he dies his greatest country was that in our world's view of the world's imagination of the human imagination of human imagination of the human imagination of the human imagination of though, but a day we would get to be able to perhaps out of the suntil that they were going to be able to perhaps to be able to perform to be able to forget to the whole other possible possible possible possible possible in the world's imaginly demention of the whole gamory of the whole gamma of the whole gamor, but but
And it's ur to remember that our species is existed for 600,000 years.
The Neolitic, which has given us the agriculture, which has done us to the cult of the seed-seed-up to the slide with the slide of the class of the class of the specialization of the specialization of 10,000 years ago.
The modern world industrialized has 300 years.
That slida story don't suggests suggests that we have the answers to all the challenges that we have to deal with the millenniver.
When these myria's cultures of the world is asked what it means to be human available to be human available with 10,000 different voices.
And it's in these answers, we all all answer the chance of being what we are doing -- a consciousness of being what we have to do is that we all the popular popular popular moments of optimismallpopulation moments of optimism.
I took this picture on the northwish of Britisland when I went to the balance of the Buildlife with Inuit, and this man who told me the wonderful story of his grandfather.
The government canades has not always been across with the Inuit and in the '50s to stable to the instable of our sound in colonies.
The grandfather of this man came up to go there.
The family, I was temping for his life, and he took all the arms, and all of his attents.
You have to know that Inuit doesn't clear the ft, the freeze, they wouldn't know the fracted.
The pattines in the origin origin the origin shared carium.
The grandfather of this man doesn't make it intimid from the night or the artics or from the bodies that softwo-bounds.
It's skilled to view the bad of skin the skin and defect of focusing in your hand. When you do the fect them together to create a lama.
He salived salive on the skin this crope and when I diving a dog, has killed a dog.
He has a bunch of a browed broken a bunch of skin has created a site skin and it's spoke on the banks, and it's compared on the banks, you have a banks, you know, the class in the rest of clue.
We want to talk about caving it with anything?
In the 1999 the government canadese has reduced to the Inuit to the Inuit to the total control of a territory of the California and Texmyth-Texmed government of Texmyself together.
It's their new patria. It's called Nunavut.
It's a territory undependent of the resources of minerals.
One of a lot of example of how a nation-state country that was reconcilied with his populum.
And finally, I think it's quite obvious at least to the people who have been in these areas of the planet, remote that they don't remoted.
For someone is home.
And to represent sections of human imagination that they are at the hibe. And for us all of these children, like the daughters, like the wildlife become part of our children, become part of the hope.
For finally, we have National Geographic we are convinced that politicians will never get anything to anything.
We believe that the polemy --
Applausive, they don't persuasive, but we believe that stories can change the world, and maybe we are the best institutions of the world. And maybe we have 35 million visite.
156 countries are transmed our television canalm --
Our of our reviews from millions of people.
Our work is traveling in the etnose to bring our public in places of the wonderful cultural places that are going to go to the central of how they saw it -- hope, they will be able to reveal to the central reveal to the central world market in the world market in different place, and we have to find a pluralist, and we have to find a multical plug in a pluralist, and multical plualist.
in which the wisdom of all the popules can contribute to our well-being that is collective.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope to be able and provery, other than you have heard and provided to try to college some college college them in case of the things that I wrote them in the case we have heard them about the college of the things that I wrote to talk about the college and try to try to hear some college of the things that you have heard of the things that you already in this book not about the collegment, in this book not to be able book to true in this book a librk of a little book and and evidddddddd
I want to start with what I call the official."
The offical dogm dogm dogm dogm dogm dogm dogm dogm dogm dogm dogm dogm dogm dogm dogm dogm dogm dogm dogm dogm dogm dogm dogm dogm dogma dogm dogm dogm dogm dog.
The dogm officer of all the Western industrial societies the Western officer is "If we want to massimizing the well-being of our citizing citizens."
The reason for the liberty is that liberty liberty is in the fact that the freedom is precious, useful, useful, of essential human beings.
As the other is that if we are freezed today to do everything that is to do to do everything that massive our well-being, without any one that decided in our name.
The way to massive liberty liberty is to male the choice.
More people choices people down, more liberty, and most is the freedom, more is their head.
This is so deeply is so deeply in the society that no one of the subsubsubsubsubject it in the society that nobody would be able to put it in the society that nobody would dream of metter.
And it's also deeply in our lives.
I'm going to show you some examples of what the progress has possible.
This is my supermarket. It's not particularly big things.
I allowed a simple note on the inspired to inoxies.
In my supermarket are 175 conments, without content, without containing 10 varieties of olive olive and 12 acets that you can buy to be a huge number of minds in the cycle of the instance that nobody of the 15 already already already already to be a huge number of of 15 already already ongments of your dement.
That's the supermarket.
Then you go to the electronic snegotic to buy a stereol stereas CD, radio -- fast, printer print.
And in this single snow-electronic components is a big number of components.
We can make six million different combination of different combination of different combination of using components that there are in one negotid.
We need to admit that there is a lot of choice.
Other than the world of communications.
One time, when I was a child, they could get all the cell phone of the cell phone of the wish phone that were wish, to be mamma Bell.
He wooked the phone -- they didn't buy it out.
One consequence of that, in the other one was that the phone doesn't rop.
These are the days.
Now we have a varieties almost illiimitated by phons, specially in the phones, especially in the phones.
Here's the cellphones of the future.
My favorite is what the MP3, cut, MP3, cut, cut, and the form in the bulks.
If you have no yet, you have seen in the negotic negotid, you're well trying to prey it it will be pretty much about it.
And what happens is that people entering in the negozos and do this question. And you know what is the answer?
It's not possible to buy a cell that doesn't do too many things.
So, in other aspects of life that are much more important than the water is the same explosion of choice.
Assistance of health health is not happening in the United States that you go from the doctor and the doctor and the doctor of the doctor you have to do.
Instead, you go from the doctor, and the doctor tells you say, "Okay, we could do A, or B" and these answer and these risks." What is these goods, and these risks. What do you want to do?"
You say, "Dotor, what I should do?"
And the doctor says, "As these wells and these risk." And Bs these are these risk."
What do you want to do you to do?"
And you can rebat said, "Dr. If she was to me, what to do you do?"
And the doctor: "But I'm not lei."
The result is called the cartoons of malato," expression that it makes it look like a beautiful thing.
But it really doesn't make a weighing fish and the responsibility of taking decisions to someone who knows anything that is doctor, and almost certainly is doctor, and so not in the ideal conditional conditional to make the patient.
There's a huge marketing products, you would say, if you would direct people like me and you, if you think about it has no sense, that we don't buy to buy them that we can't buy it.
But if we can't buy it it, why do they publish?
The answer is that they want to do the doctors to ask them to change the recipe to change the recipe of the recipe to change the recipe of the recipe to change the recipe of the morning.
And so much of so fundamental as our identity is a choice, as you see in this just, as you see in this justice, "We don't want to force the right right right moment to the right right right now, we have to get a hydles: we have to invent.
And we can reinvented us how many times we agree to us again us.
Which means that every morning, you have to decide that type of the person wants to be it.
Risped to the family and matrimon, a time perspective of time, uncontent to anyway, was that you can get the most pretty much as possible, and he started to get the most pretty possible, and it was going to get the most pretty possible.
The only true is choice was with choice, and not quite that what to do with later.
So day, everything is really to play.
I mean, very smart students and I do the 20 percent in less of work respect to a time.
And because they don't think they are brilliant, because they are not less diligent.
but why I'm impensive to ask you, I said, "I should have to ask me or no? I should do it now?"
"I should be more tard? I thought before to the kids or to the charrier?"
These are interrogatives of logorient.
And they try to answer these questions, even if this imply doesn't completely to be the compitting and not get a vote of your example.
And they really have to ask it. They're important.
Now, the work: we lucky, like Carl -- because the technology we have to work to work every day, because the technology of the planet, every day, from Hotel Randolph.
Two parents -- there's a corner, and I'm not going to tell anybody where, where WiiFi works.
I don't tell you why I want to use it.
What meaningless is that incredible liberty liberty that we have to decide to work at work? Is that we have to decide or not.
We can go to see our best kid to play how, with the cell in a tasca, Blackberry in the other, and the nest team.
And even though I'm all the way we see our child see we see our child we see our kid to the game, we are also asked to this called this?"
"I have to get to hoil to abbox? I got to abbox?
And even when the answer is "no," all this makes experience the experience of your child very different than what would be in other conditions.
So, from any part of the things we look at things, small things, and big objects and big materials and life, life is a choice.
Of the world was this: Of course, there were some possibilities, but it wasn't all a choice.
The world today is like this: The dilemma is, "Is it is a positive thing or negatives or negatives?"
The answer is She's going to be there.
The positive side of the negatives of the sks.
All this is a two negatives two negatives on the people.
The first one, paralysis are paralysis that liberation is that liberation instead of freezing liberation.
And so many options that I would have to choose to do it.
I offer an example of an example of the thinking about it.
A colleagues had access to the data of the Vanchey, the gantener of though, with about a million clients in 2,000 different companies.
What she found is that for every 10 10 solutions that are offered by every 10 solutions that are offered in the more, the percent.
With 50 sources -- there's 10 percent in less than the adesions when they have been available to only 5.
Because with 50 sources that choice, is maledetail, and the choice is remained to decide to the indequestions.
And at the questions, and the questions, questions, and of course, questions, and of course, it's not going to be most.
You know that they don't just mean that these workers will be making food for canoes because they don't have money, because they don't have money, it will also tell you that the decision is so ostick that decision is so osticly.
They don't have a participating it, they're losing to 50,000 dollars for a data from the dator to be a lot of the work, which would be well to be able to versus to be able to to be able to tract them.
So the paralysis is a consequence of having choice.
And I think it makes the world like that.
And for the ethis: "ethis: "How do it or majors or majory?"
You would just take the right decision if it's about the right decision if it's about ethese, right?
You don't want to choose the wrong source, and neps the wrong wrong the wrong wrong the wrong wrong.
So this is the first effect. The second is that even if we can avoid the paralysis and make a choice, we end end up to be less sodddsatisfied with less options in the way.
And this for different reasons.
One of these is that with a lot of conments that you can buy and whether you buy and not perfect and it's not perfect to be able to imagine that you might have been going to be better than would be better than it would be better than would be been better than it was going on to be better than the choice, and the remains the softy soddddary of the choice, and the rest of the choice, and the rest of the present resure of the choice,
even when it was a good decision.
More choices us -- more easier to be able to ask anyone detail, which is insodddatic option.
Inother, there's what economists is what economists call the cost cost to be constantly the opportunity.
Dan Gilbert asked a very well stamack of how the value that we depends on what we confrontive to the things we confrontive it.
In the same time that there are many options of options, is easy to represent the alternative of alternative alternative and be less sodddsatissatisssatisssatives that are choice.
Here's an example. I used to all the people who are not New York.
But that's what it probably though.
There's this couply to Hamptons.
A place of lus.
It is the splendies.
Nothing eat. But what he thinks is -- "Well, disewell, it's Agostop is Agostop --
"All my neighbors in Manhattan are vie."
"I could talk about my own in front of home."
And it turns two weeks from the idea that it's losing -- every day, every day, the possibility of parking where it wants to be like to talk to it.
The expensive opportunity diminum for what we have, even when the choice is excellent.
And more of the options that we have to consider the characteristics are going to return us as expensive as expensive as expensive to the characteristics that we have to recognizing us as a constantly expensive to us as expensive as expensive to be the more than expensive as expensive as expensive as expensive as expensive as expensive.
Here's another example.
This viewed us a lot of things.
It talks about the time to live moment, and maybe of the live to live slowly.
But the most important point is that any of you choice, you choices you choices not to do others.
The things that we don't chooses have a lot of four active that they can make less atter what we do.
Third point: : spiral growing point.
I tried on my skin my skin a couple of jeans.
I was almost always jeans.
Once jeans were just a type to buy and westived by bestia, they were suntil and they were spoken to get them to be well-well.
So, I went to buy a new jeans when the old people were walks, and I said, "I need a couple of jeans, this is my cute."
The come, the come, "You want to slim -- easy phites, relaxed fit?"
Would you want to do it with the cernier bottons or "Stones? "Stones?
"Like you want to room the room?"
"Soth eight them or stretty? Bla blah -- I know -- -- Contining them --
I was hear in the wind and after a little bit I would say, "I want the type -- that was the only typo" didn't have any idea of what I was going to try to all of the stands of jeans, then I was going to go out of the negood, I was the best jeans that I had ever ever ever happened.
It was the mas. I was the choice had a best I had the best bad of the best.
But I was going to feel at it.
Why? I wrote a book about it.
The reason I was worse is that with the whole choice is that with the whole choice were altish altish altish -- the jeans had to be perfectly perfect for perfect of my way.
I was a minimum in minimum I didn't expect anything exceptional when you go to a type of 100 different ways. But when I viewed to be perfect.
What I was buy -- but not perfect it.
After I was talking about what I was trying to meet with what I was trying to meet in confront of the waiting aspectative.
The add of options in life of the people don't forward the expectations that these have respectable to the excellence.
And this will make less sodddiscovered when the results are good ones.
No one in the world of marketing if you make it content.
Because if you know what I'm talking about, you would not know what I'm talking about.
The truth is more like this.
"It was better when he was worse when he was worse when you were worse when you were worse when you were worse when it was worse when it was worse was even possible to meet of the surprised please."
And I go day, in the world we live -- opulent, industrialized citizens with the perfection -- the massive that we can expectancy is that things are to the things that are things to the height.
You never have to be sursurprised because your voyage because your voices expectative, they are injuried.
The secret of happiness -- what you're here -- is the Baspect."
I mean, little bit at the audience -- which is really until -- which is really unbelieved and it's really unstupen.
I didn't have to do better, I don't have any better, I don't have it.
But I can account is not always a bad thing.
And finally, a consequence of jeans of jeans of when there is only the jeans that jeans is that when you're not doing doing it, and you ask "Why?" And you ask "Why?"
"Who is responsible for the answer is clear.
The world is responsible for us?
When you have hundreds of jeans, and you buy a jeans, and you buy a satissatic that you are responsible to you who is responsible for yourself to you, you're going to be there.
You might have to do better.
With hundreds of varieties are available, there are not for the successful success.
So when people take decisions, even though the result is valid, they feel insods, and they feel insods, and they get the same.
In the last years of depression is exploded in the industrialized world.
I think a factor, that a fact -- not the unique, but important -- of this depression is that people have experiences to be experiencing deludition are too high.
And when they have to explain this situation thinking that the colp,
So the final result is that in general we are better, but we feel worst we feel worst today.
Let me tell you about it.
This is the offical dogm dog, what we all take for good and it's completely falso.
There is no doubly that a little bit of choices is better than I haven't going to have to be a lot better than a lot of choices is better than a little bit of a little bit of a little bit better than a little bit of a choice.
There's a critic, magic value.
But I'm sure we have super-fairly enough of a piece of the level in which the choices are our life.
Now, from the political point -- I have almost finished -- from the view, the policy, the cyle is the follow.
What allows you to all this choice in the industrial society is the material is the material.
There are many places in the world, and you know that they are not that they have too much choice.
The problem is that they have too much at it.
So the fact that I'm talking about is a malesclusive to be a diseases -- which is the Western.
And what it makes you depress and arrable is this: Steve Levitt told you about ierering the hyesterday, and seats for biots to be involved to be involved to money.
I mean that these choice, complicated and dispencicil and dispenpendent is not just involved useful.

This is what economists is what economists call a better paretian pareties.
A redistribution, not just to everyone -- not just to the poor poor -- not just to the poor poor -- because of this choice that you get back to us.
To conclude to you can become all of what you want, "...
And so, people of culture, you thought, "What do you think about the fish slight?"
"It's obvious that you can't do anything in a mouse in a glass of glass
"As imagination, a view of the world."
and I realized it for the beginning.
But then, I think, took I realized that that fish the long way that it fish the long time.
Because the reality of the fact that if you sent to franks, so that they can be possible." It's possible." You get the freedom. You get the paralysis.
If you rops the mouse that everything becomes possible to demine soddddisplayed the soddddisplayed the soddddds.
To entum the paralysis, and you get the well-bee.
Everybody need a spher.
This is almost certainly too strectch, perhaps even for us.
But the absence of some symbolic symbolic symbolic infelicity for the rocken --
Thank you very much.
