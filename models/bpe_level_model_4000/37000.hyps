Last year, I showed these slides to show that the article calote, which is about three million years has the size of the artica, which for almost three million years has the size of the continental continental continental is a 40 percent.
But this subject the gravity of the problem because it doesn't show the pace of the ice to the ice as a ice.
The articket calculation is in a sense, the cleaning heart of the global climate system.
It expand it comes up and return it into the summer of the summer
The next slide is going to be a quick carlled on the last 25 years.
The bunch of loss have red.
As you see, they expand it out to the Europe
That's the ice in the winter, which is retreatment.
You can see that the so-called ice ice ice -- five or more, it's like the blood here from the body.
In 25 years old, in this way.
This is a problem because the climbing care of the ice around the artc ground around the artic ocean where there are huge amount of fueled as a congelated amount of carbon congelted to the microbes.
And in the total inquination of the atmosphere from global warming, that amount could doubled, that amount could doubled, overwhelmed this point of not return.
In some deep in some deep in Alaska the metan is already reboiling from the water.
The providge Katey Walter of the University of Alaska team recently slake a team based on a team -- low-winter.
Video: Wow! Al Gore: Looook, it's good if we are also going to be there.
A reason is that this termal exchanger the Greenland from the north.
This is a glacial record of it.
The laired to never reached level.
This is the Kangerlussuaq, in the southwest of Groenlllland,
If you want to know how to be swridge of the ice on ground of the ground, here is where the sea.
These are going to be increasing very quickly.
On the other part of the planet. AAntarctics, the biggest of ice on the planet.
The scientists have declaim that the ice of the ice is in deniative, and that the Western Antarctics, which is particularly quickly quickly in some submarine islands on the sheet sheet.
Equival to six feet of water, like the Groenlland, like Groenllland,
Himalaya, the third biggest block of ice -- you see new moster -- you see new laghi, a few years ago were glaciers.
40 percent of the world's population receive than the pocketer water from the sheet.
Sulle Ande: This ice is the bottom-up water found.
The laid is increased.
But when it decrecreass it happens.
In California nevada on Syy; it's about 40 percent.
Midries are in crisis.
Sevens, as you've read, I am severe.
The growing in the world leads to a remarkable increases of prehended increasing in the world leads.
The environmental disasters are increasing a rhythm and unprecedented.
Four times more numbers in the last 30 years than the previous 75.
This is a whole whole of unsustainable.
If you look in the historic context if you can see it consequences.
In the last five years we added 70 million tons of CO2 to 25 million tons of CO2 hours -- 25 million tons in the oceans every day.
Look at the area of the Pacific, from Ameraway, to the west parts of the subcontinent on the subcontinent -- where there is an radical radical impose in the oceans.
The greatest cause of global warming, with deforestation, which is 20, it's the use of fossil fuels.
Oil is a problem, and the fuel is even worse.
The United States are one of the two countries with more emissions, with China.
And he was proposing to build a lot of other central central central to a lot of other central central central in a lot of other central central central central to a lot of other central central central in the other carbon.
But we're looking at a direction.
This is the projects are the swimming projects in the last few years and the green degrees.
Each way, there is a politics lotta in our country.
The coal industry and oil industry have 250 million dollars in the last year to promoting carbon clean fuel that is a oxymore.
That image reminded me something --
Verctually, in Tennessee, where I live, there was a loss of coal wer.
Maybe you've seen it on the news of the news
This is the second biggest flow of excuse in America.
It happened around Natal.
The natalization of one of the carbon industry was this.
Video: Frosty the coal coal is a type and happy.
It's abundant here in America, and it growth our economy.
Frosty the carbon is more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and
It's a good price, adorable, adorable, and the work work they are the send.
Al Gore: From here is a lot of the West Virginia.
The biggest company on the mountains is Massey Coal. This is his friend's his friendly.
Don Blankenship: I wooked at Gore, Nancy Pelosiside, Harry Reid -- they don't know what they're talking about.
Al Gore: So the Alleance for Clima Proteition has launched two campaigns.
This is a part of it, a party.
Video: Ate: At COALergives we see climate changes like a serious threat to our business.
So that priority is to invest a big amount of money in a very strict of money in a spinning in a public and consummaria.
In fact, carbon is not sport.
We think it's cleaned -- it has a good profume.
So not predicted, climate change.
Let me do us.
Video: Atore: Callid, you've heard a lot of it.
So let's do it a turn into a structure to the structure of the framework for a cleaning coal coal carbon --
Straordinary! The machines are a little noisy of the clean technology of the clean technology of the clean technology of the clean technology
The carbon consumption is between the main causing global warming, but the nieves of the fuel of the fuel of the fuel that you see changes everything.
Take a chate: this is the hateral hatera.
Al Gore: Infinally, the alternative alternative to the economic issues and the national safety.
M: SAmerica, America, is in crisi; the economy, national security.
The file that the lines all of them in the fossil fuels.
Now, though, there's a new solution to uscircles.
Rear America: 100 percent of clean-energy in 10 years.
A plan to reach America to work, make us sure to do that, and help you stop the global warming.
Finally, a solution that you do to solve our problems.
Never power of it. Spractice of the more.
Al Gore: This is the last one.
M: He's about returning energy to America.
One of the fastest ways of fast to dependence from the fuel to dependence our planet.
Comparsa: The future is here. Venty, sole, a new network of energy.
Comparently number number two, Nuovi investments for good jobs.
Base: Rear America. It's time to be realistic.
Al Gore: A old proverbial of African says, "If you want to go speed by yourself.
If you want to go far away, you go together."
We have to go far fast.
Thank you very much.
LHC: LHC: LHC.
And I promises of switch to the way you can get back to you on how the machine.
So here I am her. And for those that time they don't have the LHC is the biggest scientific experiment -- 27 kilometers of circums.
His job to reach the conditions that were present less than a billion of the beginning of a second from the beginning of the universe -- until 600 million times a second.
And that's just the way of this is just as well.
This is the car under Geneva.
We Fotographer these min-Big in the relevels in the relevel.
This is what I work. It's called ATLAS -- it's four-meters and has a 222,000 feet and has a 22 feet.
This is a Secular image of ATLAS in built so you can see the proportions.
We have the 10 secember last year we have accesate the machine for the first time.
And this picture was taken by ATLAS.
It was because of a immenses in the control room in the control room.
It's a picture of the first particle of particles that had done all over the LHC, entertaining, going into a part of the LHC, and with particles in the relevel of the LHC, and display particles in the relevel of the relevel of particles in the relevel of particles in the
In other words, when we saw that 10 image the 110 secember, we realized that the machinery, which is a great living.
I don't know if it was going to be more than that, when somebody went on Google and saw that the page was this thing to Google and the first first page was this.
That means that we had a cultural impact on the scientific impact of scientific impact.
About a week, there was a problem with the car, it had to these rolls here -- these sleeps here -- these sleeps -- these sleep-side.
These files bring 13,000 amps when the machine works when the machine works at the massive of the potence.
Now, the techniicians in you look at the files and did, "It's not true. I'm just just going to be too subtle --
And instead can do it because when they're very fresh files.
So, at least 271 degrees, at least 271 degrees to the star space between the stars, these files can bring that current --
In one of the junctures in the LHC, there was a defection of factory.
So the files are reading and 13,000 amps suddenly meeted a electricity of a resistance.
This was the result.
Now, this is even more impressive, if you think that these magnetial magnets, and that have moved about 30 centimeters.
They got about 50 magnets.
We had to take a reef what we did to do with it.
We have repristinated them and update and over.
Now they're now going back all of their place on the subject.
By the end of the LHC is will be new intetea is new intea --
And we would like it and we expect to get the data to jugment or him, and we continue our adventure to find what are the morning, to find out what the universe.
Now, of course, in a way, these incident incidents reaccending the debate on the values of science and engineering. It's easy to confuse to defuse it. It's easy to confuting.
I think that it's so difficult, the fact that I would go beyond the limits, I think this is the value of things like LHC.
I would like to end with the words of a Inglese, Humphrey Davy, the guy, the guy, you know, furder, the defense of the pupill, his pupill, his pupill, Michael Faraday, said, "No is so dangerous for progress of the human mind, how the reef thought we don't don't have new money.
Thank you.
I want to start asking you to rethink about how to be a kid, you play.
As you realize that and to reach them, take them and to reach them, take them and to get them and to think and solve solve problems and resolve and managing with space.
The space reasoning is deeply connected to the way we understand most of the world around us.
So, from the informath of our interaction with our own interaction with physical objects, with my Patti, and my collaborator Jevuator, and my collaborator Jevuator, I started asking it: "And if we use a computer, instead of having the only a computer customer that dies did, we get the digital defetal to the sent of the sent of the sent of the sent of your hands,
and systems our pleasure,
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer, building Siftable.
In a few words, a Siftable computer, like a Sifty computer as a cott.
In a few words, a Siftable computer, like a Sifty computer as a cott.
You can move them with the hands, they can see their motion between them, feel their movement, and they have a screen and a wireless radio wireless.
But most of them are physicists, like the morning, you can just move it by simply business.
Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem for digital information.
And as they become more physicists, you know about movement, others of the movement, others, and as they become more physics, and as we did, as we did, we can explore new and fun style stils of interaction.
I'm going to start with some simple example.
This Siftable is configured to show some video: if you include it it in a direction, the rooters like this, if they including it from the other side back.
These interactive rushings are aware of others.
If you grain their business, you care what they walk around them.
If they come out and they can get it to be a little bit of it.
If they come out and they can get it to be a little bit of it.
They also have their motion and uninclination.
We then realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was the common to the data, to be a liquid in the data, as if it was a liquid -- as if it was a liquid --
In this case, we have three Siftable configured as blood and I can use them to advertise them to the central of the color in the central shock in the middle of the color in the same way where you miles.
and I can use them to be to advertise them to the central hour to shop.
If we are too too much, we can put a little bit at the place.
There are also good possibilities of learness, like languages, the mathematics and logic and logic and the results, where people can try things quickly and see the results of the immediately away.
Now I'm --
This is a Redwood sequence of Fibonacy that I do with a equations.
Here we have a game of words that is half Scarabeo and Boggle.
Morically, at every turnner, you get a letter to every Siftable, Pratically, every turnness, at every turner, you get a letter to Siftable, and while you try to make a dictionary.
Then, after about 30 seconds remiss and you have a new set of reading and new possibility.
Thank you.
Here is what children came to the Media Lab, I made them and turned a video of it.
They are very loved a lot.
And one of the interesting things of this kind of application is that you don't have to give people a lot of educational people.
You just have to say, "Bots of word," and they know exactly what to do.
That's what other people who try it.
This is our beta younger heads there on the right.
It really wanted to be a milarge-up
They were just morning, for him.
Now, this is a application of a interactive cardboard.
We wanted to build a tools for the learning of Lui is Felix.
It can be able to put new characters in the scene, satisy the slaptops.
It can be able to put new characters in the scene, satisy the slaptops.
So, it's going to get the sun of the sun --
Video: Sun's surgence.
David Merrill: Now it brought a treatment in the scene.
Video: The arancient treatment.
Bel job! Yes!
So if you share Siftable and put it nears close to the characters --
Video: Bau!
-- by inventing its story.
Video: Hi, Ho!
DM: It's a story with open final end and can do it as you did.
DM: It's a story with open final end and can do it as you did.
Video: Gold, chatt.
DM: The last example I have time to show you is a tool, made of recently, that we did recently do you know, to sample and execguing music.
It's a tool, made recently, of recent to sample and executing music.
Siftable here are act sounds like low-down, and bacteria
Each of these has four different variations, and you can choose what to use.
You can also put these sound sounds in a compounds to your pleasure.
And you can just make it just by doing a sounds," and a sequence."
These are actually you can control of live, like reverber, and the filter and the filter.
The attacks to a particular sound and then fights to update it.
And then there are the general effects as time and flight -- that you do the intersequence.
Look at how it works.
Video: DM: We will we put a basic in two Sift-Redwing: we go into a seriously, extreme other basic low.
I'm going to put a line of low.
Video: DM: Now I add some of the other --
Video: DM: And I will put the filter to the bacteria, so I can control the effect of the live.
DM: I can speak the whole sequence with lining time from a side or the other.
Video: DM: And I'm going to add the basic to the lower expression.
Video: DM: I can recombined the sequence "fle."
So I don't have to planning it first, but I can sudden, make it longer longer or more cortex, and a longer or more course.
And now, finally, I can fix the whole sequence by smoke the Sift-hand the Sift-volume-up to the Siftable to the entire sequence on the Sift-hand the Siftable "volume."
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is to build new interfaces more similar-machine interfaces like our brain.
And today, I had time to show you one of the results, and also some possibilities that we try to bring out the lab to the lab.
The concept I want to transmitting you is coming this new generation of objects designed to interact with digital media in the way we want.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the time to talk to all of you.
I am a writer.
Be books is my profession but it's more than that, of course, of course, of course, of course, of course, of course, of course,
It's also love and the fall of my life.
And I don't expect to be changing.
But this is what I said recently happened in my life and my career, who brought me to realibrate the entire reported with this job.
The particular thing is, I recently wrote this biography called "Mangia, Prega, Ama" the whequal, different prisonography previous books, for some reasons -- for some reasons, for some reasons, for some reasons, in interactional interactional --
And the result is that everywhere becomes from now, people who treat me as if I was convicted me.
Really -- convicted -- convicted it!
They come to me to everyone who are worried to me and say, "You don't you get to do better.
You don't you keep to write for all life without being able to create a book that can care about someone?"
that could care to someone?"
It's reseasicuring, you know.
But it could go worse -- to the one of the 20 years ago, when I started to tell people -- I was a adolescent -- I was a adolescent adolescent -- I was a writing.
I would go up with the same reaction as a fear.
And people would say, "You don't know what could be successful?
You don't have fear that the humiliation of refute to it?
You don't afraid to do this mestyer for all of life without any life is coming out and die on a cumulation of samp samp of the mouths with the mouths of falling?"
So, so many of course, you know,
The answer -- the short response to all these questions is, "Yes."
I fear of all those things.
I always had fear.
And I also afraid of many other things that people can't guess to it.
As a algae and other things that are scared.
But as I was about the writing what I thought and ask me the last thing about it, why is that?
Is it rational?
It's logic that anyone who should expect to be spent by a job that you feel born to do.
But what is there is so particular in creative imprese to make it nervvous to make it about the mental health careful to the other career don't do that?
As my father, for example, he was a chemical engineer and I don't remember one time in his 40 years of activities that were asked if he was afraid to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer whatever it was asked if he was a chimician, and I don't remember one time in his 40 years of activity in which it was asked if he was asked if
It had never -- that block of engineer John, how do it happen?
It didn't work like this, you know, right?
Onestly, chemical engineers like group don't have certainly in the chairs, and they gain the reputation of being alcoholed depressive depressive depressent to be alcohole.
We writers like this reputation and not only writers but creative of all of these reputation to be enormously instabmentally unwriters of mind.
And it's not remaining that look at the tristand of the magnifies of creative minds that only in the 2th century, they will die young people and often are young people and often hand them.
And also those who don't have suicide seem to be really disappeared by their women.
Norman Mailer, before I did, in the last interviewing said, "Of my book I killed a little bit of a little bit of a great deal with the work of their life.
But we don't doubat at it, when we heard this because we heard these things so long-interior some way we have completely interiored and accepted the notion that creativity and the art, evening, the notion is some kind of time-line.
And the question I want to bring to all of today,
You go good you do this -- because even look at it from a hundred of distance to me not good for anything this suppose.
I think it's hat.
And I think it's also dangerous and I don't want to see it in the next century.
I think it's better to encourage our big creative minds.
And certainly I know that in my case -- would be very dangerous -- would be very dangerous to start out to be the dark of suppositions, especially the drugs that are in my career.
Of course, I look at it, I'm pretty young -- I have about 40 years.
I have still about four work in me.
And it's very likely that anything I write about now and then it will be judged by the world as the work that came out of my last book.
He got slaves, because we're all over or less friends here -- it's likely to my greatest successful -- it's likely to my shoulder.
Oh, Gesus who think!
You know, this is the kind of thinking that leads to a person to start drinking in the morning, and I don't want to do it.
I would just just leave this work that we do.
So, the question becomes it to it?
And so I always always always seed-up to work and write is to create a perty, to create a perty, a psychological costructure, right?
I have to find a few way to find a safety distance between me, which I'm writing my natural going to be a whole bit of what it will write it will be able to get all over the time, trying to find other societies of doing things I started looking through time, trying to find other societies that could have better ideas and more healthithy and more healthies.
how to help people create creative people to manage the inerent risks of creative lives.
And that research led me to the Greek and ancient Rome.
Seguitems because the turning in circle and back back again.
In ancient Greek and ancient Rome -- people didn't seem to believe that creativity secreativity -- people didn't seem to man, OK?
It was thought that creativity was this spirit spirit and that came to humans from a few disorders from men in a few surprising and unknown away.
The Greeks called these spirits dians of creativity dians of the creativity dians of creativity.
Socrratic that he believed to have a demone to have a demin the far far away.
The Romans were the same idea, but they called the spiririt of a genius of spirit a genius.
which is great, because Romans didn't really think that a genius was a particularly intelligent is a particular smart of a genius was a particular smart of the genius.
They thought a genius was this kind of divine entity of divine ently in the walls of a artist, a little bit like the heavy Dobby, and who came out to hidden the work of the job and the outcome of that jobs and modeling the outcome of that work.
Ecceptional -- -- well, that is the distance of what I talk -- that psychological construct that you protect you from your work.
And everybody knew that was so that it was so that it worked, right?
So antiks were protected by certain things, like the too narcissnarcisssets, right?
If your work was exceptional work was not going to take all the people all knew that I was helped by this genius to help this incorporeum genius.
If your work fail, it wasn't all all of your work fail, right?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be a incapable.
And so people han creativity in the Occident for a long time.
And then the Renaisment came and all of this great idea, we put the human to the center of the universe of all the and mysteries and unleleaving space creatures that write creatures that address out of devinity.
This was the principle of humanety rational and people began to think that creativity came from the ish.
And for the first time in history, it started to referirs to this or that artist as a genius as a genius as a genius as a genius.
And I must tell you, I think it was a big mistake.
I think that allowed someone to believe that a simple person to believe that being a recicient as a recient as the source and the surprising mysteries, creative and etherals are a responsibility for a very big file to the fragile of human beings --
It's like to ask someone to sun to ingocile the sun
Deform and distores completely the ego and create all these ingestible ingestive expectations on the performance.
And I think it's been this pressure to have destruct artists in the past.
And if this is true, and I think that it becomes it, and it becomes it?
Can we do it different?
Maybe you go back to a more ancient understanding of the relationship between humans and mystery creative to
Or maybe not.
We can't cut down 500 years of rational thinking in a speech of a 18 minutes.
And you probably have in the audience that would satissent timmultiple suspects on notion of the notion of the notion of the notion of the initiitiate people on their projects.
I probably won't convince you all about this thing.
But the question I would like to ask is -- why no?
Why don't you think that this way?
Because it has more sense of everything that I ever heard to exhold the exasperants in the creative process.
A process that as anyone who ever tried to do something -- so, basically, all here -- you know, it's not rationally all of rationally it doesn't fractionally behave.
And, in fact, it can sometimes seem to be completely paranoral.
I did this recently encountered with the Ruth of the Ruth poeth -- who has now 90 years old, but that was a poet-year infant, and he said that during his childhood, and he was going out in the field, and I felt, when a poem came out of the landscaps from the landscaping of the landscaps came out of the landscaps came out of it.
He said it was like a fragorous fragorous fragorous frageous frageous fragorous fragory.
And that was rolling to roll out of the landscape.
The way it was to get to reach the land under its feet.
He knew that we had one thing to do to that point and it was to run a morning."
And so it was going to the house and it was injacked by this poetry, and it wouldn't have to make a piece of paper and a matter, rather quickly as the traffic and range on the page.
Sometimes he couldn't be very quickly, so recorrect and reaches and reached and the poeetry had to go home and the poem and her lost and she was lost and she would go roll through the landscape, and he said, "another poet."
And then there were people -- this piece I will never forget it -- there were some moments where the was almost lossssweep, right?
So, he was running at home and he was trying to card and the poetry was going through it, and he was a matched in the way he was stopped as if you go away, and he was off, and he was off.
He was offered the poem from and the reput it in his body and turned it on the page.
And in these cases, the poem would be presented on the page and intacts but the word, the last word at the last word at the last word at the first word at the first one, the last word at the first one, the last word at the reverse to the right thing.
So when I felt it -- it's fearlier to my creative process.
I don't all my creative process -- I'm not a conducted.
I'm a mule, and my way of working on is; wake me at the same time and suck and to work and to work and go on and work and go away.
But even I stand in my head, in my head, I shopped against that thing, at the time.
And I guess many of you have a face.
You know, even though the work and the ideas came to me from a certain source of not that I could honestly honestly knows it.
And what is this thing?
And how can we relate to us to do not to do the head, but we do it to remain them?
As I think of it, the best contemporary example I have is the Tom Waits, which I got a whole lot of years ago for a newspaper for a newspaper newspaper for a newspaper.
We were talking about this, and you know, Tom, for the majority of life was the incarnation of the paper, trying to control these kind of a control creative impulsive, and to control these kind of creative impulsis, and dominating these totally interioritized.
But then I get up there, and he was driving on on a day and she was driving on a Los Angeles, changed all for him.
He was going fast, and all of a very little bit of this little bit of a melodic framement that comes into its head as it does the way the inspiration, elusives, and the wishes -- and the wishes -- you know, wonderful and the wishes -- and the desire, but not as to take it.
It has no piece of card, it doesn't have a matter, it doesn't have a recorder.
So it starts to feel this kind of old anxious, "I'm going to lose it to lose and remarrate from this song lost song from this song lost song from this song always.
I don't am pretty good and I can't do it."
And instead of going to the panic stopped --
And he did the whole process and made something new and made something new again.
He just looked at the sky and said, "Hey, don't see what I'm driving driving?"
"Do you look like it can write a song now?
If you really want to exist, it comes back to a more opport, when I can take care of you.
Others, you go to care to you somewhere else today.
You go to a Leonard Cohen."
And his work process changed after that.
Not the job, the work even as a seed-like job as a seed:
But the process, and the heavy that the attornight that was released when the genius, the genius, the genius that was caused to be a problem and freedoor and the free of remaintained and tor.
But he said, this peculiar a conversation a conversation a conversation between Tom and this strange thing that he was not Tom.
So how much the story started to change a little bit the way I was working and already and I had to saved me a time.
This idea, I saved me when I was writing "Mangia, Ama," and falling, and falley in one of those disperation where we all all when we are working on something and we can't start thinking that it will be a disaster, that what the worst would be the worst book ever written to it.
Not just a bad book -- just the worst book --
And I started thinking about throwing this project.
But then I reminded to the air, and I tried to us.
So I raised my face in the husband I would say my comments to a full corner.
And I said, "Look, what you say is, if you know this book is not going to be bright right now, it's not going to be a whole thing that is not going to be a mind, right?
Because as I am I putting all of what I have, I don't have any more than that.
So if you want to be better and you have to introduce you and do your part.
Oh, if you don't do it, you know, you know, I don't make it free.
I'm going to write the same because it's my work.
And I would like to please, I would like to do my own particip," because -- the end is what -- the end is so far -- the century of North Africa -- centuries in North Africa -- the century of the sacred dance -- the lengers sacred to go on and hours and the heba.
And they were always magnificent because the dancers were fantastic.
But every lot of it, rarely, something happened -- and one of these artists became actually transmitting it.
And I know what I know I know about what I know is that you all of them, a lose of a lost point, a little bit like this.
It was like time to wound, and the dance, and the dances walk through a kind of portal and was doing nothing different from the sun, like 1,000 nights, but all you fall up.
And suddenly it doesn't just look like a human being.
But it turned out from divine and detail, in devessels in divince.
And when this was happening, the time this was -- people knew what he was -- they called him with his name.
They would reach a hands and starting to singing, "Allah, Allah, God God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, Allah, God go."
That's God, you know,
Curious note -- when the More invasis the south of Spaa, they took this habits with and the unch of the Spain the century of "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Oh, ol," you can still hear in the corrids or in flam.
In Spain -- when a artist has made something impossible and magic -- "Allah, you know, Allah, magnified, you know, uncomfortable -- a God.
And it's great, because we need.
But, the problem comes up the day, for the dance, when you wake up and discover that are 11 in the morning, and the S-morning, and the last of God is not more.
It's just a dead with a great dead to the knees, and maybe it will never be able to the wild to that alteach that altea.
And maybe nobody will be the name of God still as a given thing about his life?
It's hard to be difficult.
This is one of the most painful rereconciations to do in a creative life.
But maybe it doesn't have to be so smart if you can not be so much of the most amazing aspects of your being come from you to stand for yourself.
But I just believed that you have been data in the unfounds of this square of this squisite of your life that square you going to go to someone else when you finished.
And, you know, if we think that in this way it changes.
And so I started thinking about it, and it's certainly as I thought for severally in the work of the book that I will worry about the work that I will wore prested, the dangerous spectacularly following my great success.
And what I have to keep telling me when I feel electrized by this is, not being fear.
Let me just just your work.
He kept presenting you for your side, any of it.
If your work is dance.
If the god, I assigned you assigned to leave some of the kind of wonderful wonderful for a few things like wonderful for a moment through your efforce you can sants some kind of wonderful time through your efs, then "O!"
Otherefore, do the same thing.
And "Oh, no!" to yourself.
I think I think we need to teach it.
"H!" to yourself the same, even for the human and tests and testing talks to make you just present.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Oh,
As I know I've already talked about some of these projects on the human genome on what can mean, and what can meaning and discovery new genes.
Now we're starting a new percorsed: we started digitalize biology and now starting from that digital code we are going to a new phase of biology, designing and synthesizing and using using synthesizing and life.
We always tried to ask a big questions.
"What is the life?" is something that many biologists I think they tried to understand a different levels.
We tried several approaches, reducing to minimes.
We're digitalizing for about 20 years now.
When we sequenced the human genome was treated to go from the analogy world of biology to the digital world of the computer.
Now we ask our: can we regenerate life on this digital universe from this digital universe?
This is the map of a small organism -- Mycoplasma genitalium, which is the species from the smallest genome of those who can self-self-self-self-self-replicate in the laboratory.
And we tried to reduce the genome to create a even smaller.
We can get a hundred of genes of the genes of about 500 genes that are here.
But when we look at the metabolic map of the metabolic map to the noad.
Belilights this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate -- one at the time, it's very unlikely that this can bring a viventh cell to a living cell vivent.
So we decided that the only way to progression was synthesize this chromosome so that we could modify the components to bring the components to bring some of these questions.
And so we started the adventure of the "Can we can synthesize a chromoso?"
Can you feel that we make these great molecules that we haven't ever been able to create before you do that?
And in a degree of it, can we make a chromoso?
A chromote is just a piece of chemical material in it.
The speed that we are able to digitalize life is growing at rhythm retreatment.
Our ability to write the genetic code, ageing, rather progressively slowly, but it's improving.
And our latest results, the door on a exponential curve.
We started over 15 years ago.
The process has require a lot of the past, starting with a bioetic revision before we started the first experiments.
But we found that DNA is very difficult.
There are tens of thousands of cars in the world that make small segments of DNA, the long long of 30 to 50 length of the longer segment is longer long, the segment is longer longer, more mistakes there are.
So we had to develop a new method to assembling these fragments and reach the mistakes.
And this was our first attempt, to go from digital information genome of the genome of the Phi X-174.
It's a little virus that kills bacteria.
We designed the fragments, effectively the reefation of the DNA errors and got a DNA molecule.
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemical material in the bacteria and we put it into bacteria bacteria started reading this genetic code and to make the particles.
The virals have then release out of the cells, they come back and they destroyed E.
I talked about recent members of the petrolife's saying that their own own that that they certainly understood this model.
They resider than you.
We believe that this is a situation where the software can really build his own hardware in a biological system.
But we wanted to do things bigger in stuff.
We wanted to build the entire chromosome.
I'm about 580 thousand thousand thousand and and and the letters of genetic code.
So we thought of building it in the cassette of viruses, so that we can change the chases of a vist cassette cell to understand what the components of a living cell.
The design is crucial, and if we start with digital information in a computer, these must be very accurate in a computer, these must be very accurate it.
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995, the standard accurate was of a mistake for every 10 thousand basic miles --
We found that that we would resequencing it -- 30 mistake errors. We never had to be able to do it work.
A part of the process is designing segments to 50 letters who are overwhelmed with all the other segments of the segments of the small segments of the smaller to build underunits that work together.
We try to be unique elements here.
You probably have a bed bed that we put up on the light.
Think it like this. We have a genetic code based on four letters: A, C, G, and T.
Three of those letters together about 20 adminihood, and there's one specifically order to be reading for every aminative administry of bedrocket for every aminoacid.
So we can use the genetic code to write words, thoughts.
What we did at the beginning was authographing.
Some of them have been dolphuses from the fact that it wasn't poetry.
We designed these chments to just put them on a fire with encies.
There are enzyme that repair and put them on and put them up.
And we started assembling from five to seven miles from five to seven miletter from 24 miletter to seven miletter sitting in a 24 miles lyclens to 72 miletter to 72 miletter --
One, we have these chments produced these chunks in so that we can sequence them that we are trying to create a very robust from extremely robesides -- as you will see in a minute.
We're trying to automatize the process.
So, this seems the tabellon a glass of a baskets.
When we get these sat at these very long, more than 100 miles, they will not grow it to be directly in the E.
You get to the limite of the modern molecular biology.
So we looked at other mechanisms.
We knew another mechanism recombination called homology, which is useful recombination that in biology is useful to repair the DNA to bring the chunkey to repair the channels of the channels of the channels of another mechanism called a homology recombination of homology, which is us
Here's an example.
This organisms, called Deinococcus radioharans, it can absorb three million rad radiation.
You can see in the upper square like his chromosome, it is going to be destructed.
In 12 -- 24 hours comes assembled exactly as it was before.
There are thousands of organisms that have able to do it.
These organisms can be able to be completely.
They can live under a vacuum.
I'm absolutely sure life exists in space, and you move to new rich environments of water.
NASA showed it is that this happened.
This is a picture of the molecule, that we built using these processes -- just using the lights of the design of the sat with the inserious design of inseries.
The lights carry automatically.
This image was not taken with a electron microscope, but with a regular microscope, but with a regular microscope.
It's a molecule so big that we can see it with a slightly slightly slightly slightly dely --
These are pictures that they cover a period of six seconds.
This is the publishing that we did a little time ago.
It's about 580,000 letters of genetic code.
It's the biggest molecule of a defined structure that ever created by man.
It has a 300 million.
If we spent it with a 10 carrot -- you would like 142 pages to go to this genetic code.
Now, how do we work it work? How can we active?
Of course, you get a virus is a game to kid.
It's a little bit more complicated when you use bacteria --
It's simpler cells as it is eucariotic cells like ours; you can just extract the nucleus and put it onto each other, which is basically the clone.
In the bacteria the chromosome is integrated in the cell, but we recently showed that we can do a complete train of a cell of a cell chromosome from a cell to another and active.
We purified a background, from a microbial chromosome.
The two are the two different as men from the topies.
We added some more genes in a way that we could decide what to choose for this chromosoon.
The one has then skill with enzyme and to kill all the proteins.
And when we put it in the cell was stupid -- and you open our graphy sophisticatos -- the new chromosome, the new chromosome has gone inside the cell
And we were thinking that we couldn't go to it that three, but we still have a lot of people in there.
This is one of the greatest mechannels of evolution.
We found that a lot of species; they added a second or a third chromosome somewhere, added in a second thousand new trats to that species.
So who think about evolution like a gene to evolution that you don't know a lot of the biology.
There are enzyme enzyme enzyme enzyme enzyme enzyme enzyme --
The chromosome that was in the cell doesn't have one.
The cell phell that we have inserit--a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-so-a-the chromosome that we put inserito--a-the chromosome.
It expressed, and it recognized the other way as a chromosome, and we got a report, and we found it with just the cell and the new romost, and the new chromo.
It became the brought to the genes that we have insert.
And in a short of time, all the characteristics of a species have been lost in a new species, I went out to a new software that we put in a new software that we put in the cell phone.
All the protects have changed, membrane, and when we read the genetic code, the genetic code, the balance.
Now, this might seem high-genetic alchemy, but altering the software we going to change things in a pretty substantial way.
Now, I have explaned that here is not about geneses: But progress from three million and a half million and a half million and a half of evolution, and I said that maybe we're going to create a new version of Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosion of this digital process.
Why do I do I do that?
I think it's pretty obvious when we think about our need to be in our need to be there.
We're going to go from six and a half billion people in the next 40 years.
Just to give an example: I was born in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for each existing in 1946; 40 years will be four of them will be four of them there.
We're going to have a lot of food and cleaning and cleaning, medicinal and gas for six and a half billion people.
It will be even harder, it will be harder.
We use more than five billion carbon dion, more than 30 billion oils.
That means millions of barrels a day.
When we try to find biological processes to replace them, or any kind of process to replace them, it's a huge challenge of me.
We have to keep the whole of the CO2 emission of these materials that ends up in the atmosphere.
At the day, because of the scientific discoveries in the whole world, we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I like to think that are the design components for the future.
The electronic industry has only a dozen about how many different things are coming out of it.
Our limits here are the basic data and our imagination.
We now have some techniques of these steps of synthetization, can create what we call combinatory genomics combinatory methods of these things.
We can build a big robot, robots that can produce a million chromosomes a day.
Think of process, these 20 million genes or to try to optimize the processes to produce either either either either vaccines, we can change it, we can change -- we can change -- because of a little team, and create more biology than in the last 20 years of science.
And it's just a standard selection section.
We can choose to survival and fuels or fueling off, production of carbon vaccines etc.
This is a few software programmed with some software programmed to be able to sit and design species to be able to sit and design species to the computer.
Well, we don't know how to be going to be done.
We know exactly what their genetic code.
Now we're focus on fourth generation.
You also see that you who extract ethanol from the gry was a male experiment in the sea maintaste experiment end.
We have fuels depending on the third generation that will come up with some of the higher than the wall-up carbon or different kinds of sits like the either or different types of the sits or different types of sits from the eighth generation --
But the only way biology can have a great impact without increasing impacts the cost of food and limiting the cost of food and limiting the degree of CO2 cells that we are working for design cells that can achieve the purpose, and we we could have the first carbon cells that we could get the first carbon than 18 months.
Solar sunlight, with CO2 is a methodo; but in our discoveries around the world, we found different methodoes.
This is a organism that we described in 1996.
It lives in the deep ocean -- about 2,500 feet to the temperature of the water.
It creates meter from CO2 molecular hydrogen, as a source of energy.
We are trying to figure out if we can chanch CO2, which can be transported by tubes, converting that CO2 in carbon in fuel to drive this process.
So short we think that we could be able to increase what the basic question is, "What is the life." And we have the modest is the goal of replacing the entire industry.
Exactly. If you can't do it from TED, where do you can it?
It would be a main function of energy.
And we are working on using to use the same methods to create the same methods to create instants.
You saw this year with the influence, we're always back, and we are always back, and a dollar's gone in less when it comes to find the right vaccine.
I think that that you can change in a combinable vaccines in anticipy.
And that's how the future could start changing, now, the tree of evolution, accellerating the evolution with bacteria and then the evolution with bacteria and then the eucarian cells.
We are so so much from improving people.
Our purpose is to make a long enough to try and make a fit to be a lot of it.
And the first of all I will show you the fastest possible possible some fundamental jobs, the new technology that we took to Microsoft to a almost a year ago -- this is Seadragon. This is Seadragon. This is Seadragon.
This is a environment where you can interact both of the local level that remote with a huge amount of visual data.
Here we're seeing a lot of gigabyte of digital pictures with a kind of a continuous zoom and continue, for a speed bread and continuous speed of panoramic pictures as we want.
And it doesn't matter how big the amount of information that we see, how big these are the big of data or images.
Most of them are communities and this is a scanning scanning from the Biog of Congress, and recepting in the legal of Congress,
It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that the relimits of a system like this is the number of pixels on your screen in any time. It's also a very flexible architectural
This is a whole book -- you know, you don't imagine.
This is Dickens. Each Casa Casa Casa a capitula.
To show you that it's just about a representation and not imagines, we can do something like this, to see that it's a representation of a representation of the test, not a picture.
It could be a little artificial book, to read an electron book.
Not you don't advice.
This is a more realistic. This is a number of The Guardian.
Each image is the beginning of a section.
And it really gives you the pleasure and the beauty experience of reading the real version of a magazine or a newspaper of a magazine, which is for nature a multiple kind of a half of a review of a half of a review of it.
We also made something with the corn's corn's in particular.
We created a high-resolution advertising -- much more than what you use in a normal commercial -- and we put in a normal content -- and we put you in a normal content content content ent content on it.
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile and you can see here.
Or other models, or even specifically the techniques.
And this really demonstrates some of these ideas to helimining the limits of space on the screen.
We hope that this lady to put a few to the few to the pop-up to the pop-up to be necessary.
Of course, the map is one of the obvious applications for this kind of technologies.
And I don't want to lose time, if not to say we have contributions to also on this field.
These are all the streets in the United States over, you know, a geost image of NASA.
So now we go pass to something else.
This is now is actually living on the web; you can see it to see it.
This is a project called Photosynth, which is two different technologies.
A is Seadragon and the other one is a very interesting computer visual computer to do it by Noah Snavely, a student of Washington, with the aid of the US and from Research Szelii of the US and a good collaboration. A great collaboration. A great collaboration.
And it's living on the web, and I was managed by Seadragon.
You can see it when we do this kind of screen that we can go from one image to the other and have this kind of a picture of the multiple resolution to multiple resolution in the other way of this kind of a picture of the other way that we can go from one image to the other and have this kind of a picture of the other kind of a picture.
But the space collocasting images here has actually a meaning.
The visualization algorithms of computer visualization has recorded these images together, so that the imagines -- all of the reviewed -- all of the waste -- all the waste to the lands of the Clagree on -- were taken of a slide-shot. Here you see of the elements of a spinning panorads, and these things have been connected to space.
I don't know if I have time to show you some other environment.
There are a lot more space.
I want to go to one of the original data, and this is from a previous previous prototype of Photosynths that we did work for the first time last summer -- to show you what I think is really the key thing I think is really the key to the environments behind this technology, Photosynthosynthet that we put in the website.
We had to worry about the legal and so on.
This is a reconstruction of Notre Dectual Flickr. Bastdigital reconstruction from Flickr. Bastdigital camps, other of the camps, other camps, and so you get images of the camps, and so one of these arguys around. Each of these argues --
So they're all images came from Flickr and have been related to the space level in this way.
And it's possible to navigate in this very simple way.
You know, I would never ended up to work for Microsoft.
It's very gratifying this kind of a collection of a laptop.
I think you can see that it's a lot of different types of framework in the SLR, a phones in this environmental professional numbers in this environment.
And if you can see, I try to look for those more strange.
Many are block by face, etc.
Something here is a series of photographs -- there it is a series of photographs -- there -- there it is.
This is a poster Notreposter Dame recorded correctly.
We can go from the poster view of this environment.
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment. This is now taking data from everyone -- from the collective interaction interviewing as the land from the land of visual view, and all of those data together.
All those pictures are getting connected together, more than the parts.
You have a model of the land of the entire emerge.
Think about this as a promotation of Stephen Lawler on Earth on the virtual Earth
It's something that grows in complexity as the people are using it, and the advantages for those who uses are increasing with use.
Their pictures are marshed with other people.
If you get the idea of a delivering all these guys say, my picture of the Caths of Notrecit Notrechis suddenly all of those data, and I can use it as a point of British point to get into that space, in that space, in that metaphor to be using the images of the other person is cross-shelring and cross-shots of a shots of a shots of a shots of a shots of a shots of res-res-shock
Of course, all of this is very high-scale models of all the interesting models of every interesting part of the earlier and the satellite images and satellite images and satellite images and satellite, but by collective.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Do I understand whatever your software is that your software will be doing is that at a certain point, in the next few years, all the photographs of everyone in the world will be basically connected?
BAA: Yeah. What is doing in practice.
It's creating hyperlink, if you want to be a pictures.
And it's doing it in the content of the images.
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the wealth of the several information that many of these images are being a lot.
As a research of images on the web, you know, a fruiting and the text on the page Web page is a lot of information about images.
Now, what if that pictures you connect to all your picture?
So the amount of seedly connection and the amount of wealth that comes to really get to me. It's a classic classic classic is a classic classic effect of the res.
CA: Blaise, it's really amazing.
BAA: Thank you very much.
One of the main pleasure of the delights, and one of the innographic research is the way that has no antic antic of the traditions, between who had no antic antic of the traditions, the sloping in the wind, the folks in the sheet in the sheet to love.
You know, the shamans still over the Jaguar trials still over the Milky Latta, or that the wiss of old Inuit are still meaning -- or the Himalaya, the budying of the Dhar, the budying of the Dharm of Dharm -- to remind the central importance of the Dharm of the South pologia, and the idea that the world in which absolutely but it's just a model of reality,
the consequence of a particular type of adaptative choices that our stirs has been done, good or mal, many generations ago.
And, of course, we all share of essential trates.
Everybody born. We all see.
We are subjects to get reports to start with it.
We have to deal with deaths death, so we don't get the balance if we channels --
We all have a art art.
What it hits is the most rhythm of the canzone, the rhythm of every culture.
Not matter that they're the Borneo, or the Borneo, or the follows of Haiti, or the Haiti, or the desert of the Kenya Sepentrion Sepentrion of the Sepentrion of the Shara.
He was my journey of journey in the desert a month ago, or a walls, or a walls, and the desert of Mounder, the mother of the world.
All of these people teach us that there are other ways of thinking, other ways of thinking, other ways of thinking, other ways of moving in the world.
And if you reflect a minute, it's a concept that can give you a bunch of it.
Inside, cultural mirich mirich miricades the world creates a spiritual and cultural life that fly the planet and it's important for the benefits as a biosphery as a biosphery as as biosphery.
And you can think about this ragny raised as a a ethnoxfer and you can define the ethnoxifies the total of all the concepts, hideas, hispirations, ideas, inspirations, ideas, inspirations, being being from the human beings from the tree of consciousness.
Eetnosfer is the wonderful pathrimony.
It's the symbol of what we're and what we can be as as a kind of quisitives.
And because biosphere was seen, as it was quite consumed as a very quickly consumed and unfortunately much faster.
No biologist, for example, it would say that 50 percent of all the species is or on the bedroom, because it just fail, simply because it's fail, or -- in the most apocalittic field -- in the field of biological diversity -- that the culture of cultural diversity.
The indicates all of this is, of course, loss in language --
When you're born 6,000 languages on on this planet.
A language is not only composed from a vocabulary or from a series of gramatical.
A language is the sprap of the human spirit is the push of human spirit.
It's the means with the animation of every culture in the material world.
Each language is a forest of the mind, a though, a though, ecosystem thinking, a spiritual possibility of spiritual possibilities.
And of those 6,000 languages, as we sit in Monterey, at least half is not being sussurrated in the ears of kids.
They don't come to the kids, the whose whom you don't know, that you don't don't get something -- that I'm dead to be.
What is there is more sad than being the silence, of being the last to be the last to talk a language, of not to transmit the shift of the wisdom of the daughters or to anticipate the promise of of children?
This horrying in the world is the state of someone in the world every two weeks a laughters dies and a wall-old language dies of a language.
And I know someone to say, "Is it not the way there?
The world would not be a better place if we talked all the same languages?" Benissue, then we all yoruba. Parlid sing?
Let's talk about a kogis.
You will will be a tract thing that means we can't talk to the language.
Today, I'd like to do a journey through the ethnosfera's ethnos;
a little journey in the ethnoxfer to give you a above what we're lost.
Many of us forget that when I say, "different ways of exists, I really mean different ways of exists.
Take for example, this Barasana, Amazony, in Sepentrion Sepagagree the population, the population of anacony, which creates the military of the lens of sacries.
It's a popular popular that it can't distinguish the color from the green because the celests is identified in the time of the forest, which depends the population.
They have a strange language and a marriage rule, said, "exogamymy, languages, "exogamicy."
And all of that has roots in the political past, yet is that in these extinct families in which these extreme family marriages -- the language of any any any case, the unlike the mysteries of no language.
They are limited to listen and then they start talking about.
We take one of the most interesting tribes with the Waorani Waorani of Ecuador nordororal population, a population that had the first contatts in 1958.
In 1957 mission have tried a contact with a facty mistakes to commit a factory mistakes to commission a face.
They made it from the top of the photographs that they would rely reach them in a few who would think that this population of the rain the rain the rain of the rain forest of the pluvial of the ra-dimensional raise.
They raised the pictures of the ground, they turn it to the research of a shape or a shape and not find nothing, they have conclaim that he was the diavold, and they killed five mission with the lances.
But the Waorani didn't kill the foreign of the foreign
They kill with them.
54 percent of the death was caused by their own themselves.
We are eight generations and we found two of natural death cases and when we got to know -- they put one of them in the way to saying, they have a one of them was so aging that has dead aging with the same, they died the same, they had a incredible knowledge to the forest knowledge of the forest.
The hunters were able to recognize the animal urine from 40 steps and recognize the species.
In the early '80s, I was assigned a really interesting job when my professor of Harvard asked me if I wanted to go to Haiti to intruphones, and the basis of Duvalive and Tonton Macoutes, and impossesse to me to make the veleness to use the velended up with zombies.
To make a sense to miracle in a miracle culture and that Voodoo culture and that Voodoo is black magic bly.
It's quite a metaphor or vision of the world.
Very interesting.
If I asked you to tell me the great religions of the world, what would you would would say it?
Cristianity, Islam, Buddismo, Ebraism, etc.
A continent is always leaved out, thinking that sub-Saharan Africa has no religious ffaiths. And instead of the Voodoo is the distilled of these religious religious concepts of the slave of the slavery of slavery of slaving slavery of the slave is always asporters of nated slavery.
What makes you interesting the voodor is the intrigued to life and death.
So you live your own own own spirits.
The spirits can be invocated by the Grande Aqua, respond to the rate of the dance and they replace to the anima, so that for a brief of the vive to the follow is the following is the deal.
So this voodooists love to say, "You want the white to talk about God.
We become God."
And from the moment that you are poss; it's the spirit you drive, you can do that?
So you look at these incredibly incredible events. I follow your voodoo in the state of tracking time-infugee tricks of the mind when it catalyzed in a state of extreme in a state of extreme.
Betin's people who I lived the most extraordinary are the Kogi of the Sierra Nevade Santa Marckey Colombia of secentrion the Colombia is in the Colombia
With the ancient civilization that once they lived on the careers that once they lived on the career of the Colombia in the conquist, the population of the vulchanical massive that you were on the carbolombia that you were on the carbongst of the freezing of the carbely.
In a continent macchieved of blood of this population never had been conquisted by the spagrees.
And at all. And there are governed by a click but their trained is really extraordinary.
The young following are being taken by the families to three or four years and live in a world of good and shadow and shadow in a world of good and shadow to 18 years.
Two period of nine years of reproducing the nine months of management that spent the nine months of management that spent in the user of the Great Mad.
For this time, they come accultured to the values of their companies, values that their prayers and only their prayers and only their prayer -- or to say the cosmic balance.
At term of this amazing staration, they suddenly carried out and for the first time in their lives, at age age age of 18 years old, they see a shake the sun of the first belong's gallalles, all that they learned in theory comes comes conference in the splends and said, "He'd go back to a step and says, "Hear sple. The prey is a past of Indian address and says, "
"Do I like you know, like I have a detail.
It's amazing. Now it's going to protect it."
You call the biggest brothers and say that we we, the minors, we are the honey of the world.
This level of intuition is extremely important.
When we think of Indiations and we ended up Rousseau and the old story of the wild of wildlife of the wild noble in its simplicity or maybe we invote that these people are closer to the Earth of us.
The indegenes are not not feeling nicely none feeling or unhappy from our algia.
There is no space for these things in the wages of Asmat windy or in the gelidness of Tibet, but because of time and rits, they created a mystic of the Earth is not about the concept of being aware of it, but on a very well subtle beyond the concepts that the Earth can live because it's only unused by the human consciousness,
What does it mean?
That means that a girl of the Ande who grows to believe that the mountain is a spirit Apu that will will lead to be a deeply human being being being deeply and a pretty different relationship with the mountain or that place to a Montana or that is growing a girl or that grows to grow a mountain mass or a massive mountain a mass of rock to be a mountain a shake of being a shock of a shop.
which is the dimora spirit or a little bit of a mineral belt.
What is interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between individual and the natural world.
I grew up in the forest of the Britannica creating that the forest forest forest forest to be cut.
That made me a human being different from my friends in the Kwakiutl who believe that the forests are the Hukukukukukukukukukukukuk's death going to be north of the world, spirits who live in the Hamatsa.
If you start to consider that these cultures can actually create different reality, you can start to understand some sense-discovery sensitive discovery spot.
I took this picture to aprile in the nordockey to the western Amazony.
Maybe some of you have heard of the ayahuase, the most powerful psychective repertoo.
What makes a fascinating ayahuase, it's not the potential for a drugic frame, but its processing. It's made by two elements.
From a lian lian lian lian coal bunch of beta-carbols, harmine and harminds; a little bit of a coal better.
And if you take the only plant one is a filled fire that alters a little bit of the conscience, but it's measured with the leaves of a coffee arbuster of the coffee of the coffee.
This planta bunch powerful triptamines, very similar to the nights, methoxyltrypt-methoxyltryptamines.
If you ever see Yanami to shoot the news of the replacement of the substance of species, so it is a different set of the methoxyamins.
Tird that pole on the nose is a little bit like being disappeared by a firedwels and land on a sea of electricity.
I was often I was often with my professor, Richard Evan Shultes, the man who made the psycheapc was psycheap, with his discovery, with his discovery fungs in the '30 in Mexico.
I think my text can classify these triamines as hallucinogens because if you're made not to be hold anybody to be hallucinated auciny. But the triptamines may not be honorally because they're denaturated by a ima hamine-in-ended out of the monoxyy;
It's possible to assume to the bears with other chemicals that denly denial chemicals that are denied MAO.
Now it's the beautiful bead-carbols that you find in this book, are inbyors of MAO, the same kind of need to potentiate triptamines. The question is available to a four-hour of plants, how do these people find two death dead-did, do these people don't find in this way, they believe in this way, a biochemical version that is danging a version that is dangangery in this several sus of the part?
We use the great euphemism of proof of the proof of mistake and error, which can reveal infruttly.
But if we ask Indians, they will tell us "Polin."
What does it mean?
This tribes the Cofan, has 17 variety of illahuase, that distinguish nicely nicely in the forest, and our eyes would go into the same species.
If we ask him how they were getting their pocksonomy will tell us about plants, "Three I knew about plants, "No."
The solution is, you take 17 variety in a nightful of a full and each will be with a different round of it.
With this not a Harvard, but it's much more interesting than to count stames.
Now, [Happlies the problem is that even the ones of us who have heart people who have to care in Indian people, but somehow reduced them but somehow reduced to the sea real world of the real world and it goes beyond it to the see.
In fact, 300 years, 300 years, it will not reminded to remind for its wars or its technology, but rather like the was where we stopped and we embraced with actively or accepted the destruction of mass of diversity and cultural destruction of the planet. Now the problem isn't change.
All culture through the century are involved in a dance for new possibilities.
And the problem is not technology.
Indians have not being Sioux when they put out of the Syoux when they put away from the arc and frequququick as a cable, and they don't have to be a cable, and heyx.
It's not change or the technology or threat the integrity of ethnosfera. It's the power.
The hard hard fly to domination.
And if you take a look at the world, you will find that these are not culture destined to disappearing.
I live living creatures and dynamics out of the existence of identify existence.
Whether you trats in the pathric of Penchors,
a popular Sarawak, a population in the southwest asian, a population that has lived in the forest to a generation ago, and reduced to a generation -- and reduced to prostitutions on the rivers of the rivers of the riverm of the CEOs Cinese Meria, where the naves of the Cinese Meria Chinese Meria, where the naves are illumine in the Japanese in the Sarawak,
ready to report the swood with the bond becomes in to the forest --
Or, in the case of Yanomami, are the diseases that have come with the discovery of the golden golden gold.
If we move on on the Tibet, where I'm doing a lot of research, you will see the harbor flit of political political monunes.
As you know genocide, the physics of a popular popular level, but the destruction of a universal level, but the destruction of a popular popular lifetime of a popular popular of a popular popular of the conviction of development.
You can't understand the ceiling of the Tibet until you start to the beginning.
I lost the 6,000 miles from Chengdu in China in China in China through the Tibet southern with a young colleague, but only came to Lhasa young line, but only came to Lhasa a young line, but only came up with the statistics that we feel about it.
6,000 monuments in the polator sacred and energy.
1.2 million people killed by military in the Culturtural revolution.
The father of this guy was ascrited to Panchen Lama.
which means that it was killed at the time of Chinese invasion of Chinese invasion of the Chinese invasion of agadesion.
Her is was outside Santity during the diaspora that led the population in Nepal.
Her mother was imprisoned and his shot, was to be rich.
It was brought to hidden the age of two years from below its below its gonna because it could not live in its gonna because it could have live without him.
The sister that has done the same, was put in reedure.
A day he wrote a best, a fasolk of Mao Mao and, for this transgression, was to be put in the workers for seven years.
Tibet of the Tibet can be inable, but the spirit reports of the population is to keep present.
At the end of the end, it reduces a choice.
Can we live in the monotic world of the monotic world or we want to acknowledge the policy world of diversity.
The great antropolooga Margaret Mead, before we die said that his biggest fear was that in our way to this worldview of the world, not only will we see the whole range of the imagination of human imagination in a limited constantly modality of thinking, but a day we wake up up to a dimental in a dimentary of the way that there were other possibilities.
And it's humbling our species is existed for 600,000 years.
The Neolition, which has given us agriculture, which has made us to be a descend of the seed-revolution in the seed-proof-cler culture with the clera, creating the hierarchia of specialization, and we talk about 10,000 years ago.
The modern world world world industrialized in a 300 years old.
That suspect is not suggests that we have the answers to all the challenges that we have to deal with the millennia.
When these cultures of the world of the world is asked what to be humans, they respond to to be human, they respond to 10,000 different voices.
And it's in these answers that we all risk our possibility to be what we are.
I took this picture of the north of Baffin, when I went to Baffin, when I went to the whales of the Inuit, and this man and this man and this man and this man man man in his grandfather's way;
The Canadian government wasn't always to be gentlemen with the Inuit and in the '50s to be able to our sounds in the colonies.
The grandfather of this man refuse to go into it.
The family on his life, he took all the arms, and all of his attempt, and all of its attacks
You have to know that the Inuit don't know the cold -- they can exploit up.
The slyls were made of heaved fish in the skins of peaks were made of the skins.
The grandfather of this man didn't have to be smart from the art night or the basis of the bely's night or bely;
It's sunchaired by the pants, and it turned the pant, and then the panted in their hand. When the other other people have a lot.
He pushed on the salives, and when they came out of this caccept and when I solid it, he killed a dog.
He brought the dog and created a brilly, with the toxa to-to-to-to-k-bunch and made a glass, and it has disappeared on the band, and the cacces in the stair.
We want to talk about rid with nently nice several ways, so that in different ways, [Applausilience of the Inuit and all the people in the world.
In aprile 1999 government canadese has been rejected to Inuit the total control of a whole territory of California and Texas put together.
It's their new pathria. It's called Nunavut.
It's a independent land land land land land of all the resources. They Controllate all the resources.
One is a wonderful example of how a nation-state can recognize with his people.
And finally, I think it's pretty obvious to who we have been in these areas of the planet, I realized that they don't be any remote at all.
For someone is home.
They represents select the human imagination that reach to the tree of the time -- and all of these children, as the dreams of these children, they become part of our children, become part of the geography of hope.
National Geographic we are convinced that politicians will never come to anything.
We believe that polemicy --
[[Applausious, but we believe the stories can change the world, and maybe we're the best institutions to tell the stories of the world. Each each month to tell stories of the world. Each in the month is 35 million visits.
156 countries transmitted our television channel.
Our magazines are beds from millions of people.
Our work is traveling to ethnoxfer our public in places of the most cultural places that are going to be had, and they will go down from how they have seen and, you know, they will will be a central revealing of the ancient of the ancient of the ancient world to find a easy of life in the world in a plurist and multicultural world and multicultural reach, and we have to find a world in a plurder.
where the wisdom of all the populations can contribute to our welsewhere.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope to call other than what you've already heard and I will try to deliver some links, in case you don't notice them.
I would like to start with what I call "the dog."
The official dog's office?
The official dog's officer of all the Western industrial societies. The official of all of our citizens," "If we want to massize, "The way to make it is to massize.
The reason for the state, in fact that freedom is in itself a value, is pray, useful, is fairly for human beings.
On the other one is that if we are free, each of us can do anything that masses our benefit and not no one who decided in the benefit without any decision in the name of our.
The way to massive freedom is to massized freezing choice.
More people people are free, more free, and more and greater is their freedom, the more people are freedom, the benefit to be.
This is a deeper deeply rooted in society that nobody would dream to put it in a doubt in a doubt of the society.
And it's also deeply in our lives.
I'm going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible to do this.
This is my supermarket. It's not particularly big thing.
I lost a simple note on conditional conditions.
In my supermarket there are 175 conditions, without counting 10 variety of extracts of olive oils and the 12 balsamic beets, you can buy you to a huge number of conditional constant in the scious constant of your degree of the circus of your degree of a degree of it.
Here is what the supermarket.
Then you go to the stereas as a stere: Cassasses, reader CD, radio, CD, radio, radio, the CD, radio, the preslificator.
And in this single store, in this single store, there's a big number of audio components.
We can make six and a half million combinations using the components that there are in one negoties.
You need to admit that there is a lot of choice.
Other comes: the world of communications.
Once I was a kid, you could get all the wished phones, that they were plug from mom mama Bell.
He was bonged the phone, you didn't buy it.
A consequence of that, in the other one was that the phone is that the phone is not a make.
These days, I went to it.
We have a almost illimitated variety of the cell phone of the cell phones --
Here are the cellphones in the future.
My favorite is the one in a middle, reader, reader, and the hidden of the nose and the crash, and strinhold crash.
If you wouldn't have it yet seen in the store under the case, you're going to get it to come.
And what the end is that people enter in the stores and said, "No."
It's not possible to buy a cell that it doesn't do too many things.
So in other aspects of life that are much more important than the water, you think the same explosion of choices.
Little health is not happening in the United States that you go to the doctors and the doctors what you need to do.
Instead, you go to the doctor, and the doctor, and you can do A, or B., "B.'" "B, these risks" "Be these risks. What do you want to do with the risks. What do you want to do that?"
You say, "Dr. Dr. Dr. What would I do to do that?"
And the doctor says, "A melephs and these rischecks, and these risks."
"What do you want to do that?"
And you rebate it, "Dr. if she was me, what do you do?"
And the doctor: "But I'm not her."
The result of we call it "Phauthonomy of malato," expression that makes it look like a good thing.
But in fact, it's not a shift and the responsibility of making decisions by someone knowing something -- you know, hously, you know, it's not -- and so it is not -- and almost certainly is sick -- and so not in conditional condition, to make the patient decisions where the patient --
There is a huge amount of drugs, and if you think of it doesn't make any sense, and you think if you think it doesn't make sense, that we can't buy them.
But if we can't buy them, why are we going to buy them, why are we going to buy them, why are we going to buy them at them, why are we not buying them, why are we going to buy them, why are we going to buy them, why are we we can't buy them, why are we going to buy them, why are we going to buy them, why are we there are we not buying them, why are we we buying them, why are we not buying them, why are we going to buy them, because if you can't buy them
The answer is that they want to doctor we call the doctor to make a doctor to change the reception.
Something that is so fundamental is our identity is a question of choice, as you see in this journey. We don't want to babies. We don't want to force the babies. We don't want to be a western time. We don't don't think about.
And we can reinvention how many times we get a grade ded.
which means that every morning, in the risking, you have to decide that kind of person wants to be.
And I received to the family and marriage a time perspective, and it was that there was almost a lot of the most prester as well.
The only real choice was with when, and I don't even what to do later.
On day, it's really to play.
I think of a very intelligent students, and I do their 20 percent in less than I work on a time.
And not because they're less delivering, because they're less diligent.
But why are I imones, I mean to ask yourself, "Would I marry or no?
"Would I have to marry me later? I would have to think before the care?"
I'm logging interrogatis.
And they try to answer these questions, even if this implemented not completing the companies that I assit at my exame.
And they really need to ask it. I'm going to ask it.
Now, the job: we're lucky, like Carl subtolineavy, because technology allows us to work every day, from the Hotel Randolind, except from the Hotel Randph.
He's a parentia, and I won't tell anyone whatever the WiFi works.
I don't say, because I want to use it.
What does this amazing liberty of choice that we have about working on work? It's that we must be a continuously decider, if we have to work or not.
We can go to look at our kidy to calculus with the cellphone in one pockets, and the notebook, typically on the knees -- typically on the knekeepers on the knee.
And even if they're all sorts of these, every minute that we see our son boy of the game we are also asking this call?"
"Would I answer this email? I have to email? I get to email?"
And even when the answer is "no," all of this makes the experience of your son game of your son son is very different conditions.
So, from any part of we look at all, these little big, things and style and style is a question of choices.
On the world was this: Of course, there were some possibilities, but it wasn't a question of choice.
The world today looks like this: The dilemma is the slightly positive thing -- "Is it positives, or negative what?"
The answer is Scient is Scienty.
The positive layers are all sorts of them all of them -- so I'm going to talk about the negative lays.
All this choice behaviors in two income.
The first one, paradoxy, is that produces paralysis, rather than free.
With many options between the choices, it becomes very difficult to do it.
I offer you a mean: A conducted study that a flict student floors.
A colleagues had access to the data from Vanguard, the gigant, the gigant, with about a million clients in 2,000 different companies.
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are offered in the more, the percentage of adesion.
With 50 deeply of offeres, there is 10 percent in less than when they're available only 5. Why is that?
Because with 50 founds what choices, is very difficult to decide and choice is remainly difficult, and choice is remaintain questions.
And I still wondering, questions, and of course, questions, and of course questions, and of course they don't get it.
You know, that doesn't just mean that just means that these work from old people to be going to be dogs because they won't make any money, also want to say that decision is so hostic that even the funds of the jobs of work.
Not participating are even getting to 5000-dollar data, which would be good to bought to be.
So paralysis is a consequence of having too many choices.
And I think it makes the world like this.
"And finally, for ethnic --
You would like to make the right decision if it's for ethernity, right?
You don't want to choose the wrong fund to the wrong fund --
So this is the first effect -- the second one is that though we can avoid paralysis, and we finally stunsatisfacfacfacts from what we would choose to be with less options between the other which choice.
And this for several reasons.
One of these is that with a lot of conditions, if you buy one and it's not perfect, it's easy to imagine that you could make a different choice that would be better choice different than it would be better choice. And what it turns out is that alternative to enjoined us to both of choice, and rempiant soddisfalling the reliation of the satisfyment from the decision of the decision of the decision of the choice,
even when it was a good decision.
More choices are very easy to disappearing to any detail that is inherent option.
And then there is what economists call expensive opportunity.
Dan Gilbert has a very well stamattine as the values that we give things things to depends on what we confronti.
And then then you can do a lot of options possible is to represent the features, the alternative carries of the shot and being less soddisc of the option that you have choice.
Here's an example. I take me with all the ones that are not in New York.
But that's what you probably thought about it.
There's this copy to Hamptons.
A place of lussided.
Spipipes in the daily Spipipe. It's all for them.
Not lack. But what he thinks is -- "Well, maledition, Are is Again."
"All my neighbors in Manhattan is vid."
"I could park right in front of the home."
And it goes two weeks with the idea that it's losing -- every day -- the possibility of parking -- the possibility of parking where it wants.
The cost opportunity decrease the religion to what we have, even when choice was choice was excellent when choice was excellent to it.
And the options that we have to consider -- more the characteristics are going to come back against the cost of opportunity.
Here's another example.
This vign, there tells a lot of things.
It is about living the moment, and maybe of the living moment, and maybe in the living time.
But the most important point is that anything you choose to you choose to not do the others.
The things that we don't choose a lot of actives, that can make less attactive.
Third point: The spiral growing of expectations --
I tried it on my skin, buying a new jeans.
I was almost always jeans.
Once jeans were just a typical and dress and walk from the besty, they were smark -- they were smart them a life and work a lot of times, starting to go good and work a lot of time, they were doing it very well.
So, I went to buy a couple of jeans, and I said, "I'm going to get a couple of jeans, this is my cutted."
The committed to me, "Would the slim fit, relaxed it?"
Would you like a cerniera or with the bottonies? "Wed" or "acidd." Or "What?
"Do you want a road?
"Would you want to be a stret? Ble -- he was the blah -- he was the bolks --
I was smart, and I was a little bit of a little bit -- I would like the only one guy, and I was the only one guy, so I would go to all the maleans, and then I came out of the negoti, and I came out of the negotia, and the best of the negotia -- I had ever had had.
It was the male of it. With all that choice I had the better.
But I felt worse.
Why? I wrote a book to understand it.
The reason I was worse is that with all the choice was that with all the way my expectations were alties,
I was expectations of minimately I didn't expect to anything about it, but there was one typical of them -- but when I saw 100 different guys had to be perfect.
What I had watched was good -- but not perfect it.
After I had to compare that I was injury in confronted with what I was looking at the expectancy.
The addition of the people in life of people don't don't make the expectations that these are respect to the options of the options of the options itself.
And this will produce less soddisfation, even when the results are good --
None in the world of marketing if it makes it matter.
Because if you know what I'm talking about.
The truth looks more than that.
"He's better when it was worse when it was worse when it was worse is that when it was worse it was even worse to meet some of pleasures evolved.
On day, in the world we live -- opulent industrialized citizens with the expectation of perspective, the maximum that we can hope is that things are at the height of the expectations of the expectations of it.
You never have never surprised to evolve because your expectations -- my expectations are ingiant to be ingiant to it.
The secret of happiness -- what you're here -- "Basexpect." "Yes, you want." "Yes, you want."
I mean, small moment -- small authorients, which I really am married and my wife is really stupid.
I couldn't do better, I didn't have to do better, I didn't have to do better.
But to account it is not always a good thing.
And then finally, a consequence of the samp of a couple of jeans is that when you are not satisssatis; and you ask you why?
Who is responsibl?" The answer is clear.
The world is responsible. What would I do with us?
When there are hundreds of jeans, and you buy a inatisfacfacent, and you ask you is responsible responsible responsible for you are responsible for you are you.
You could have a better be.
With hundreds of variety of variety of variety of unsuccess.
So when people make decisions, even if the result is the result is -- they hear and make the satisfacfacts and they make the same.
In the last years of the last depression is exploded in the industrialized world.
I think a meaning factor -- not the only one, but the important -- of this hondipression is just that people have delusion because standard is too high.
And when they have to explain this situation thinks that the hit is them.
So the final result is that we are better, objectively, but we feel worse.
Let me tell you about it.
This is the official dog; what we all take for good and it's completely fail.
There is no doubt that a little choice that is better than that it doesn't have any long, but it doesn't come a lot better choice is better than a little choice is better than a little choice --
There's a critical value -- I don't know what it is. I don't know what it is.
But I'm sure that we overwheled by a piece of the level where the choices improves our life.
Now, from politician point -- I have almost finished -- from politician, the nurture's point of politician, the nice is the following.
What it allows all of this choice in industrial society is the material.
There are many places in the world, and you know what, where the problem is not that they have too many choices.
The problem is that they have too few of it.
So the faccenda factors that I'm talking is a malarial to be exclusive to the modern's exclusive.
And what it does to depress and angry is this: Steve Levitt talked about how those costs and swcomods seats are useful with the shelter of the cost.
I mean that these choices, complicated and dispendious, it's not just inutilize them.
I'm even deleterious to be right.
They make us worse.
If a little bit of what in our societies societies would be reverse to those where people have too few people have too few possibility, it would not be just the life to improve but the notel nosis.
This is what economists call a paretyan improvement.
A redistribution of the redition is good to everyone -- not just the poor -- because of this choice in a lotly.
To concluder: You can become all what you want,
Voics, people in culture, they think -- "What does that make that fish?"
"It's obvious you can't make anything in a mouse of wet."
"A imagination of fall-up vision vision of the world --
and I was in the way I got it in this -- at the beginning.
But then, I realized that that fish the long-know-of-that fish fish the long time.
Because the reality of the fact is that if you send the mouse the mouse of the right, so that you can get right, you get the freedom. You get paralysid. You get paralyside.
If you break the mouse so that all of you can decrease diminate the defation.
With paralysis, and you get the benefit to be.
Everybody needs a sphere.
This is almost certainly too closed, maybe even fish, maybe for fish, and certainly for us.
But the absence of some symbolic symbolic is a recipe for infelicity -- I am -- I am for the Reseline.
Thank you very much.
