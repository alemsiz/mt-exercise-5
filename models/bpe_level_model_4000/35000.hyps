I showed these slides to show that the article demonstrate that the artical calot, which for nearly three million years of the United States, has the size of the 48 United States, it was 40-percent of the United States.
But this undervalue the gravity of the problem because it doesn't show the ice of the ice because it doesn't show the ice.
The artic heat is is in a way, the heart of the global climate system
It expanding and flower and return it into the summer.
The next slide is going to be a quick fast on the fast of the last 25 years.
The sea glacier sea time-red.
As you see, they get up to the blue blue blue blue blue blue blue blue blue blue blue blue blue blue blue blue blue blue blue blue blue blue blue of it.
That's the ice in the winter that is retreated.
You can see that the so-called lost ice lost ice and five years or more, is like blood here from the body.
In 25 years old, in 25 years old.
This is a problem because the exhibition of the ice around the ocean artc where there are huge amount of carbon as there are enormous amount of carbon congelated to the microbial with the microbial ded.
I respect to the total pollutionary of global warming, that how much it could double this point of not returning back to the point of not return.
In some deep in Alaska in some deep Alaska is already rebolling from the water.

Video: Wow! Al Gore: She is good. The question is if we will also be there.
And a reason is that this termic exchanger from the Gerenland from the north.
This is a glacial record river record.

This is the Kangerlussuaq, in the west of Groenlland, in the the East of the Groenlland,
If you want to know how to sheet the sea sea sea of sea sea of sea -- that's where the brand the sea.
These current are increasing very quickly.
In the other part of the planet: Antarh's greatest block of the planet.
The last month of scientists have declaim that the ice is in negative, and that the Western Antarcticket that a little bit of the ice island, is particularly quickly in the sheet of the ice is particularly quickly.
It is six feet of water, like the water, like in Groenland,

The environmental disasters are increasing a rhythm and without precedented them.
Four times more numbers in the last 30 years of respect to the previous 75.
This is a whole whole whole thing.
If you look at the historical context if you can see the consequences of it.
In the last five years we added 70 million tons of CO2 to 24 hours of CO2 hours in the oceans every day.
And look at the area of the East East, from Amer, to the Americh, in both the parts of the subject subcontinent in the ocean as a radical oxygen, in the oceans.
The greatest causes of global warming, together to deforestation, which is 20 percent of it is the use of fossil fuels.
Ooil, is a problem, and carbon is even worse.
The United States are one of the most emissions, together at China.
And it was proposed to build many other central central central plus
But we're seeing a changing direction.
These are the projects in the last few years and some proposites of alternative greens.
Any way, there's a political lotta in our country.
The carbon industry and oil have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promoting carbon clean carbon clean carbon oxymore.
And that image I reminded something.
Very Natalalalalso, in Tennessee, where I live, there was a 3.8 billion gallons of carbon dixieters of carbon carbon dioxiety of carbon dios.
Maybe you saw it on the news there.
This is the second largest flow of America's scale in America.
It happened around Natmaking.
The natalization of one of the carbon industries was this one.
Video: Frosty coalaie is a kind of a fallegry and happy.
It's abundant here in America, and it makes our economy.
Frosty the carbon is increasingly more and more and more cleaner.
It's very good price, adorable, adorable, and they keep the stockling the stocking.

Al Gore: So the Alleance for Clima Proteation of Clima Clima has launched two campaigns.
This is a part of it, a part of it.
Video: ALer: At COALergives we see climate changes like a night to our business.
So we have a very priority is to invest a lot of money in a publicitary to make public and consuming the carbon truth and consuming the carbon truth and consuming the carbon truth of our priority to be a big amount of money in a public-the-priority to be a big amount
In fact, carbon is not spore.
We think it's clean -- it has a good profume.
So not predicted, you know, climate change.
Let me do it.
Video: Actually, you know, you heard a lot of -- you heard a lot of it.
So we do do a turn into a structure in a way of the clean as it is about the clean carbon on the clean coal coals.
Straordinary, machines are a little wheels, but that's the sound of the clean fuel of the clean technology.
The carbon consumers is between the main causing global warming, but the remarkable of carbon -- but the remarkable technology that you see changes everything.
You take a look at this is the odiernaked out of the carbon technology.
Al Gore: Infinally, the good positive to economic match and the national security.

The file that lines all the time is our dependence on fossil fuels and oil oil oil as a spork and oil oil oil oil and imported up.
Now, yet, there's a new new solution for circles.
Rear America: 100 percent of clean energy, in 10 years.
A plan to put America to work, make us sure safe to make sure sure and help the global warming.
Finally, one solution that you basts to solve our problems.
No America. Scover of them.
Al Gore: This is the last one.

If you want to go far away, you go together."
We have to go far fast.
Thank you very much.
Last year at TED, I did a introduction on the LHC.
And I promises of switch to update you to update how the machine.
So here I am here I have. And for those that time doesn't have the LHC is the largest scientific experiment that you ever tried -- 27 miles of circuits.
His job to reach the conditions that were present less than a billion of second from the beginning of the universe -- to 600 million times a second.
And this is just the environment.
This is the machine under Ginevra.
We do these min-Big Bang in the relevels.
This is what I work. It's called ATLAS -- it's large-4-foot and it's a 2meters and it's 2meters.
This is a spectacular image of ATLAS in construction so you can see the proportion of ATLATLAS in construction so you can see the proportion of ATLAS in construction so you can see the proportion of ATLAS in construction so you can
We have the 10 sect last year we accurate the machine for the first time.
And this picture was taken by ATLAS.
It was because of immense in control.
It's a picture of the first particles of particles that had done all the LHC, entering into the LHC, and deliberately, with a part of the LHC, and detection particles in the reach.
In other words, when we saw that 10 secember, we knew that the machine was a great living.
I don't know if it was this to do more than that, when somebody went to Google and saw that the page was this to Google and it was this one was this.
That means we had a cultural impact beyond in the scientific impact.
About a week later, there was a problem with machine, it had to these files here -- these files here -- these sleeps -- these sleeps -- these sleeps.
These files are 13,000 amps when the machine works at the male of power.
Now, the technicians in you look at the files and will say, "It's not true. It's not true.
And they can do it because when they are very co-called the superconducting files.
So, at least 271 degrees to a fall the way between the stars, these films can bring that current --
In one of the junctures between the LHC, there was a flex. There was a fabrication.
So the films are going to be reading and 13,000 printing suddenly met a electrical resistance.
This was the result.
Now, this is even more impressive, if you think these magnetic magnetic magnetic spots of 20 tons of it, and that have been moved about 30 centimeters.
They were damaged about 50 magnetic magnets.
We had to take a sheet thing that we did about it.
We have repristined and uplocal them.
Now they're now coming back to their place in their place.
By the end of the end of the LHC is going to be new integroup.
And we would like it and we expect to get some data to jugment data to find out what are the morning and we go so our adventure to find out what are the morning.
Now, of course, in a certain way these accidents reaccendate the debate on the value of science and engineering and engineering in front of it. It's easy to confuting.
I think that the fact that it's so difficult, the fact of going to the limits, I think this is the value of things like LHC.
I would like to end with the words of a scientist Inglese scientist, Humphrey Davy, the guys, in defense of his pupill, his pupill, his pupill, his pupill, his pupill, and he said, "No is so dangerous for the progress of human's human mind as the degree of the human science is definitely not mysteries in nature, which we have no new money, and that are not new mony
Thank you.
I want to start asking you to think about when you get a kid, you play on the morning.
And as you get to get them and grab them, take them and make it and get them to get them and sold to think and solve problems and solving the space problems and solving the space problems.
The space reasoning is deeply connected to the way we understand most of the world around us.
So, by informate, inspired by our interaction with physical objects, with physics, together to my own own own consultator, and my collaborator Jevan Kalanithi, I started asking "And if we use a computer, instead of having the only delight-and-delight-grade dest as a kstick -- we could actually take a digital deffflightly to get the information with entlate with entles,
and we get it to our pleasure to me?
And the question was interesting that we decided to explore the answer, building the answer, building the Siftable.
In a few words, a Siftable is a big interactive computer as a cottle.
In a few words, a Siftable is a big interactive computer as a cottle.
You can move with their hands, they can see their own hands, and they can see their movement and they have a screen and a wireless radio wireless.
But most of course, they're physics, like the morning, you can move it just affect it by by the morning.
Siftable is an example of a new tool-mainstruments to manipulate digital information.
And as they get more physics, you know, you know about the movement, others, and as they get more physics, and as they become more physics, and as they get more physics, of how we did, we can explore new and fun style style style.
I'll start with some simple example.
This Siftable is configured to show videos -- if you include it in a direction, the video so that if you including it in a direction, the other hand, it on the other side back.
These interactive portraits of interactive portrayers.
If you grade them at the thing is their intors.
If they come circumstances, they can get a little bit.
If they come circumstances, they can get a little bit.
They also have their movement and unclination.
We then realized that one of the interesting interesting interaction was the common to the data, to be able to use the degrees, to be a color as if it was a liquid as if it was a liquid of the interaction of the interaction of the interaction of the interaction of the interaction of the interaction of the interaction of the interaction of the inter
In this case, we have three Siftable configured as a greety brickets and I can use them to stream in the middle of the color in the middle of the size of the color in the middle of the size of the green-in-set-Sift-set-Siftable configured as a little bit of the vernal
and I can use them to go to the color in that central state, where they are missing them.
We can do that, we can put a little bit on it.
There are also good possibilities of learning, like languages, the mathematics and games where people can try to try to get the speed things and see the results of the immediately.
Now I'm --
This is a Redbonacy that I do with a program of equations.
So here we have a game of words that is in half Scarabeo and Boggle.
And of course, at every turns, I got a letter to every Siftable, Pratically, at every turns, I got a letter to go on to Siftable, and while you try to make a dictionary.
And then about 30 seconds are remissing, and you have a new set of letters and new possibility.
Thank you.
So that's where the children came to the Media Lab, I made it so that I did it and turned a video video video.
They have a lot of loved a lot of it.
And one of the interesting things about this kind of application is that you don't have to give people a lot of education.
You just say, "Compons of word," and they know exactly what to do.
So that's what other people who try it.
This is our younger better;
It really wanted to get large.
They were only morning, for him.
Now, this is a lip application of a whole cartoon
We wanted to build a tool for learning of Lui English is Felix.
It can be able to insert new characters in the scene, and they can get Siftable to get on the scene --
It can be able to insert new characters in the scene, and they can get Siftable to get on the scene --
So it's doing the sun of the sun of it.
Video: The sun is surgend.
David Merrill: Now she brought a treator in the scene.
Video: The treatment.
Bel work!
So schooling the Siftable and put it close close can make the characters --
Video: Bau!
And by inventing their story.
Video: Hello!
DM: It's a story with the open final opening, and it can decide he wants to do.
DM: It's a story with the open final opening, and it can decide he wants to do.
Video: Gold, gatt.
DM: The last example I have time to show you is a tool tool that I did have recently made recently, to sampling and executing music.
It's a tool, made recently, to sampions, to sampions, and executing music.
The Siftable here are acting sound like low, and bacteria.
Each one of these has four different variations, and you can choose what to use.
You can put these sound sound in a way that you can get these sound to your pleasure.
And then you just do it just touch a sound and a sequence."
These are actually actually that you can control from live, like reverbers and fild.
You attacks to a particular suit of particularly and win the stocky of it.
And then there are general effects as long and volume, which you do it with the whole sequence.
We look at how it works.
Video: DM: We will start putting a couple of sequence in two Siftable "sequence."
I'm now going to put a bunch line.
Video: DM: Now I add some of the ussion:
Video: DM: And now I'll put the filter to the bacteriia, so I can control the live.
Video: DM: I can speak the whole whole whole thing with a time by a side or from the other.
Video: DM: And I'm going to add the bottom-up to the bottom.
Video: DM: I can recombined the sequence "fle."
So I don't have to plan it before, but I can improvise it longer or more corn.
And now, finally, I can fix the whole whole thing with the left the Siftable le-hand the Siftable "volumes."
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is to build new interfaces more similar-machine interfaces more like our brain and body.
And today, I had time to show you one of this lost results, and also some possibilities that we try to bring out from the lab to the lab from the lab of the lab.
The concept I want to transmition is that it's coming this new generation of objects for interact with digital media -- which will bring information in our world in the way we want.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the time to talk to all of you.
I'm a writer.
And I think about books is my profession, but it's more than that, of course, of course, of the whole thing.
It's also love and my life of life of my life.
And I don't expect that it can change.
But I said that something particularly happened in my life and my career, who has brought me to realibrate the whole relationship with this work.
And the particular thing is that I was written this book, this biography called "Mangia, Prega, and Ama," the which, differently from my prizes, for some reason that it came up with a big sail, bestsell, bestseller interactly.
And the result is that wherever you go to me as if it was convicted to me.
It really -- convicted -- convicted a!
They all come to me to all worry about and they say, "You don't have fear you can't do it?
You don't keep writing to go to write for all life without being able to create a book that can care of somebody?"
that can care of someone to care about someone?"
It's rassicury, you know.
But it could go worse and worse that I remember more than 20 years ago, when I started to tell people -- I was a adolescent -- I was a writing.
I walk up with the same reaction as it was fear.
And people would say, "You don't teme to be successful?
You don't fear that the humiliation of refute kill?
You don't fear to do this mestior for all life without any life without any of them ever come up and die on a comulation of snaky saming with the mouths of fall?"
So, so it turns out that you know.
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is "Yes."
And I fear of all those things.
I always had fear.
And I also have fear of many other things that people couldn't guy.
As the hand and other things should.
But as I think about the writing what I thought and ask me the demand, is why?
Is it rational?
It's logical that anyone who should be waiting for being spent by a work that you feel born to do.
But what is there so that we particularly in the creative makes us nervous to make us nervily worth in a way that other carefully in a way that other carefully.
As my father, for example, he was a chemical engineer and I don't remember one time in his 40 years of activity in which he was asked if he was asked if he was afraid to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer if he was asked if he was asked if he was asked if he was asked if he was asked if he was to be engineer if he was afraid to be
It never -- that block of John, how do it happen?
It didn't work like this, right?
And so chemicals engineers like a group don't have certainly in the secuptilycoholed the reputation of being alcoholed maniaced.
We writers, we have enough this reputation and not only writers but creative of every generally, we have this reputation of being enormously instabmentally.
And it is not another one that look at the sad continger of the magnificent creative minds that only creative in the 2th century, they die young people and often are going to be young people and often for them.
And even those who are not suicide they really look like being really, really, in fact, by their women.
Norman Mailer, before before in the last interviewed said, "I s," I got a little bit of a little more extraordinary about the work of their lives.
But we don't drink when we hear it because we heard these things long, and we have all these things that in some way we have completely interior and accepted the notion are in some way that the creativity and art are in some way that art, to the enjoy and art, will always be going to go to the enjoy of the hurder.
And the question I want to leave all of today,
And it is good this thing -- because it also looks at a hundred distance to me, not really good for this guy.
I think it's odious.
And I think it's also dangerous and I don't want to see the perpetuate in the next century.
I think it's better to encourage our great creative lives.
And because I know that in my case -- in my case -- in my situation would be very dangerous to start out to that the dark of supposed to support the circumstances in which I am in my career.
And that is -- I think of it, I'm pretty young and I have about 40 years.
I still have about four decades of work in me.
And it's very likely to write about now and then it will be judged by the world as the work that came after the last book.
I'm going to be slavery, because we're all over here -- is likely to my greatest successful is at my shoulder.
Oh, Gesus who thinking.
You know, this is the kind of thinking that leads a person to start bing a person to start bing gin the morning, and I don't want to do it.
I would just just go to do this work that we do.
So, the question of it becomes up, right?
And so I always always on, after many reflection that the way to work to continue to write is to create a perty psychological cooking -- right?
I have to find a security of security between me, which I'm writing and my natural is going to be able to get all the way that he wrote will be able to get all the time. And I was looking for all over the time, trying to find other societies to see if they could have better ideas and healthcare and healthy more healthier healthy and healthier healthy and more healthy healthcare and more healthy than they were doing this in a few ways of security
how to help people gesture inherent inerent emotional risks of creativity.
And that research took me to the Greek and ancient Rome.
I would go to a circle and then back back to the circle and back back.
In ancient Greek and ancient Rome -- people didn't seem to believe that creativity from man, OK?
It was thought that creativity was this spirit and it came to the human beings and seven-known and unknown and unknown and unknown and unknown away.
The green chunks called these beings and the "demonior of creativity demony.
Socrratially, wonderful, he believed to have a demlivered shocry.
The Romani were the same idea, but they were called that spirit without a genius of the spirit without a genius
Which is great, because Romans didn't think a genius was really that a genius was a smart.
They believed that a genius was this kind of divine that believed in the walls of a artist, a little bit like the elf, a little bit like the elf, and who came up to the artical of the artical job and model the outcome of that work.
It is a -- there is the distance of which I talk -- that is the distance of which I talk -- that construct psychological that protects you from your work.
And everybody knew that it was so that it worked, right?
So the ancient artists were protofed by certain things, like the too narcissnarcis; right?
If your work was exceptional, you couldn't get all the detail and all of the delivered genius.
If your work fail, it wasn't all cut, right?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be a incapable.
And so people han creativity in the Ocent for a lot of time.
And then the Renguguess came and all of this great idea; we put the human being to the center of the universe to the center of the universe and mysteries that write in the mysteries that write details.
This was the principle of human-rational human rational and people started thinking that creativity was completely from the idivided to be completely from the idivid;
And for the first time in history, it started to reference this or artist as a rather than a person with a genius than a person with a genius with the genius.
And I have to tell you, I think it was a big error.
I think that allows someone to believe somebody as a recipe of being like a reciplent as a found, the essence and the source of all the mysteries and unknowable is a very much much to give to the fragipsychology.
It's like to ask somebody to ingoid the sun
It deform and decreates the ego and creates all these ingestiable ingestive for performance.
And I think it was this pressure to have destroy artists in the past 500 years.
And if this is true, and I think it is, the question becomes and now?
Can we do it different?
Maybe you can go back to a more ancient understanding of the relationship between humans and creative mystery of creative mystery of the human relationship mystery of the relationship between humans and mystery.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we can't cut 500 years of rational thinking in a 18 minutes.
And there is probably people in the audience that would have been suspects of scientific meeting the notion of the notion -- and you get people on their projects.
I probably don't really convince you all about this thing.
But the question I would like to ask is -- why now?
Why don't you think about this way?
Because it has more sense of everything that I've ever heard to explaining the exasperants in creative process.
And one process that as anyone who ever tried to do something -- so, basically, all here -- yeah, not rationally it doesn't have rationally rationally -- you know, all here -- you know, all here -- you know, you know, all here -- you know, you know, all here -- you know, you know, all here -- you know, all here -- you know, all here -- you know, you know, all here -- you know, all here -- you know, you know, all here -- you know, you know, you know, all here -- you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you
And, in fact, it can sometimes be completely paranormal.
I did this meeting recently with the extraordinary poetc. Ruth Stone, who has now 90 years old, but it was a poet-year in his wall-up in the wil, and he was working out in the wall, he was working out in the field, and he was when he was in the landscape from the landscape from the landscape from the landscape of when he was in his landscaps.
And he said that it was like a fraorous fragorous fragorous fragorous fold.
And that was coming rolling to her from the landscape.
And it was going to get there, because it was going to get the land under his feet.
He knew it was a single thing to do to that point and it was words like a morne."
And so it was going to go to the home and it was going to be in this poetry, and he wouldn't have to make a piece of paper and a wall of paper -- and a wild walls and grab it on the page.
Sometimes it couldn't be pretty quickly, so it was so fair, so it correct and running without getting to the house and the poetry her her own and he would continued to break through the landscape and he would continued to roll through the landscape, as he said, "another poet a poet poet to be in the lands."
And then there were times -- this piece is not going to forget -- there were times when it was almost lost moments in which was almost los; OK?
So, it was going to go home and was looking for the paper and he was looking for the card and grabbing a match right in the while she was going on, and then he was like to walk up with the other hand the step off.
And it was offered the coda and he would put it in his body and turned it on his body and turned it on the page.
And in these cases, the poetry would be in the perfect page and intacts but at the contrary of the last word at the first word at the first word at the first word at the first word at the first word at the time.
So when I felt it -- it's just crazy, it's exactly the huge, it's exactly the huge.
Not all my creative process -- I'm not a conduct of it.
I'm a mule, and my way of working on it is; wake up to the same orary every day and to work and go over and go over and go over and over the wild.
But even in my head, in my head, I was going to strip against that thing, at the time.
And I guess many of you have done it again.
You know, even if the work and ideas came up with ideas to me from a certain source source source I couldn't honestly know.
And what is this thing?
And how can we relate to each other, in a way we don't do lose your head, but plucky it stay up.
And as it really, the best contemporary contemporary that I have is the Tom Waits, which I interviewed a few years ago for a day.
We were talking about this, and you know, Tom, for the most of life was the incarnation of life was the incarning, to control these species of impulsize, dominating these totally interior of these kind of creative impulsis.
But then he agreed up, and he was driving on a car in Los Angeles, he changed all of him.
And it was going to speed and all of a lot of a melodia, which comes to his head as it does the inspiration, elusive and allies, and allies, and the wish and the wish and the wish and the wish -- you know, it's wonderful, you know, it's wonderful, and wish and wish and all of a lot of a melodid, and all of a lot of melodid, and all of a way of melodies, and the wishes of a me
It has no piece of paper, it has no mate, it has no matter, it has a record of it.
So it starts to hear this kind of old anxiety to him in him and say, "I'm going to lose and session, and I'll remark with this song alway.
I don't have enough and I can't do it."
And instead of going to the panic stopped it.
And he did something completely new.
And he just looked at the sky and said, "Hey, don't see that I'm driving you?"
"Do you look like a song now?
If you really want to be there to be a more opportraise when I can take care of you.
Otherment, you go to to take someone else to care about it.
You go to disturbing Leonard Coken."
And his work process changed after that.
Not the work, the work even even as well as it always as well.
But the process, and the heavy that was released when the genius was released when the genius out of he caused to him in the way that they were caused to the back of where it was coming from, and it was going to be a interior of the way and tor.
but yes this peculiar, wonderful bizarre collaboration between Tom and this external thing, and it was not Tomom.
So how much the story started to change a little bit how I was working and already and I already saved me a time.
This idea, I was saved when I was writing "Mangia, Prega, Amap and falls in one of the disperation where we all when we work on something and we can't start thinking that it's going to be a disaster, which is going to be the worst book -- which is never going to be the worst book --
Not only is a worst written written at the worst book
And I started thinking about throwing this project.
But I then remember Tom who is talking to the air and try it.
So I raised my face in the hand-a-up and I would say, my comments at a room.
And I said to high at high and you say, "Look, what if this book will not be brilliant not going to be brilliant, right?
Because as I see that I'm putting us all the way I haven't have any more than that.
So if you want to be better and do you have to introduce your hand,
OK, but if you don't do that, you know, you know, I don't do it nothing.
I'm going to go to write the same because it's my work.
And I would like to favor that I was on my own own part that I was to do my own part because -- at the end of North Africa -- centuries in North people who were radance to the North people were radance to the walk to the walk and the walk to the walk and hours to the walk to the walk and hours to the walk to the albit.
And they were always magnificent because the dans, they were fantastic.
But every lot of it, I would have happened to be a lot of these artists became actually translent reality.
And I know what I talk about, because I know you all have seen it at a certain point, a lost of it.
It was as if time stops and the dancer, and the dancers walking through a kind of car, and it wasn't doing nothing differently from the sunnnnnaked out.
And suddenly not only as a human being.
But you access from divince and detail in the fire of divinity.
And when this next to the time this was the time -- people knew what he was -- they called it with his name.
They were constrained hands and they started singing, "Allah, Allah, God God, God, God, God, God, God, God."
That's God, you know,
I was Curious -- when the More invaser the south of Spain, they took this habits with their and the ready ready to get into the centuries from "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Alla
In Spain, when a artist has made something impossible and magic and "Allah, you know, magnificent to it, you know, the magnificent -- you know, a flower of God.
And it's great, because we need it.
But the problem comes up to the day after ballery, for the ballery when you wake up and discovering that are 11 in the morning, and the last of God is not more.
It's just a death with most bad to the knees, and maybe never will never be able to get to that stand at that text altea.
And maybe nobody will be going to give God still while yet, and what does it have to do with the rest of his life?
It's difficult.
This is one of the most painful recognition to make creative life.
But perhaps it doesn't have to be so much forcing if you can not believe that, at all, all, the most extraordinary aspects of your being come from you to yourself.
But it just believes that they have been data in prester of this team founds of this team of your life that is part of your life that you have to go to somewhere else when you have.
And, you know, if we think in this whole way all changes.
And so I started thinking about it, and it is certainly as I have thought for several months in the book that I will be in the book that I will be a lot, the dangerous afterwards of my big, as I was going to be a great successful success.
And what I have to keep telling me when I feel electrized by this is, not having fear.
Let me just your work.
It keeps to your hand, any can be.
If your work is dance, bally.
If the divine, assurd, assigned you decide to leave some kind of wonder, for a few things that for a moment through your force, then "O!"
Otherment, you do the same as your dance.
And "Oh, that's no!"
I think I think it has to teach it.
"Yes!" to yourself, even for having human and tests and testing talks to you continue to be presenting you continually get to present.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: O!
As you know I've already talked about some of these projects on human genome on what can mean, and what it can mean and discovering new genes.
We're now beginning a new performance -- we started digitalize biology and now starting from that digital code, we're going to a new phase of biology, designing and sympting life.
We always tried to bring great questions.
"What is the life?" is something that many biologists I think have trying to figure out how many biological biology are trying to figure out different levels.
We tried a different approach, reducing it to minimes of them.
We're digitalizing for almost 20 years now.
When we sequenced the human genome was treating to spend the analogic world of biological biological world.
So now we ask the way to do we do to regenerate life, or create new life from this digital universe?
This is the map of a little organism, the Mycoplasma genitalium, which is the species from the smallest genome between those that can self-self-self-self-self-self-self-self-self-self-self-self-self-self-self-self-self-self-oritizar.
And we tried to reduce the genome to create one even smaller.
We can get a hundred genes of the genes of about 500 that are here.
But when we look at a metabolic maps of the metabolic map of the noway to the noway to the noway to the note.
Belililightens, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can get to a fly once, one at the time, it's very improbable that this can bring a living cell cell.
So we decided that the only way to make the progression was synthetic to get this chromodifying the components to bring some of these fundamental questions.
And so we started the adventure of "Can we can synthetic a chromosom e?"
Can we have the chemical deal with these great molecules that we never could create before I hold it?
And in case we are we going to work a chromoso?
A chromote is just a piece of chemical material in the middle of the inert material.
The speeds we are able to digitalize life is growing up to exponential rely growing up at the exponential ry.
Our ability to write the genetic code, aging progression and rather slowly, but it's getting better.
And our most recently, our most recently, the results are exponential curve.
We started over 15 years ago.
And the process has required a lot of passing bioetic revision before we start the first experiments.
But we found that DNA is very difficult.
There are tens of thousands of machines in the world that are small-of-the-segment of 30 to 50 letters and it's a degenerative proces: the most segment is longer long, more mistakes us.
So we had to develop a new way to assembly these fragments and reach the errors.
And this was our first attempt to start digital information genome of the genome genome of the Phi 174.
It's a little virus that kills bacteria.
We designed the fragments, effectively the correction of mistakes and get a molecules of DNA of about 5,000 letters.
And the interesting part of is when we took this piece of chemical material inerts and we put it into bacteria and started reading this genetic code and to produce the virals.
The particles have been released by the cell and they destroy the E.
I talked about recent with members of petrolife's industry and they said that they certainly understood this model.
They have more than you.
We believe that this is a situation where the software can really build his hardware in a biological system.
But we wanted to do the bigger things.
We wanted to build the entire bacteria.
It's over 580 thousand thousand miles of genetic code.
So we thought we built it in the bottom of viruses so that we can change the blood to understand what are the components of a living cassette cell.
The design is crucial and if we start with digital information in a computer, these must be very accurate with it.
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995, the standard accurately.
We discovered, 30 errors. If we had the original sequence we used that original sequence we never had to be able to do it.
One part of the process is designing segment segment segment of the process is to be able to all the other segment segment of the segment of the small stuck to build underpeaking together.
We try to propose one here.
You probably have to read that we put the fills of the fold.
So, thinking this is what we have a genetic code, based on four letters: A, C, G.
Three of those letters together about 20 adminihacids, and there's one specific order to be able to bear for every adminimal bedroom.
So we can use the genetic code to write words, thoughts.
What we did at the beginning was self-to do with it.
Some of them have been dolphuses from the fact that it wasn't poetry.
We designed these segment to you just join with encies.
There are enzymes and they put them and put them asyme.
And we started assembling from five to seven miletter from five to seven miles to seven miles in a way to form segment segment of 24 miles in a thousand miletter to 72 thousand letter up.
Anyway, we spend these checks in abundance so that we can sequence that we're trying to create a very robate extra of the extra tons -- as you will see in a minute.
We're trying to automatize the process.
So, this seems like the tabellon a baskets.
When we get these segments at these very long cheap segments are going to be directly in E.
You get to the limits of the modern tools of molecular biology --
So we consider other mechanisms.
We knew another mechanism called homology, which is useful to repair the geninine DNA in biology is useful to repace DNA in the segments.
Here's an example.
This organisms, called Deinococcus radioducans, it can absorb three million rads of radiation.
You can see in the diamong squeeeewing as a chromosome,
In 12 -- 24 hours comes assembled exactly how it was before.
There are thousands of organisms that have been able to do it.
These organisms can be complete completely.
They can live under empty.
I'm absolutely sure life existing in space, and you move to the rich of water.
NASA showed that this is that this available to it.
This is a picture of the molecules that we built by using these processes -- just using these processes to the design of the sat at inseries.
The lights carefully.
This picture was not taken with a photo a electronic microscope, but with a regular microscope.
It's a molecule, that we can see it with a slightly slightly microscope.
These are picture that they cover a period of six seconds.
This is the publishing we did a little time ago.
It's over 580,000 letters of genetic code --
It's the largest molecules of a defined structure that ever created by man.
It has a 300 million million people.
If we spend it with a 10 without spaces carattempt with a 10 paper per per transfer to transer this genetic code.
Now, how do we work work? How do we do it?
Of course, you get a virus is a game by a guy who are a game by kids.
It's a little more complicated when you use bacteria
It's simpler even when it's eucarios, you can just extract the nuclear and put it on one other than ours, you can just get the process of cloning.
In the bacteria the chromosome, it's integrated in the cell but we have recently showed that we are able to do a complete transplant of a cell trailer cell of a cell and active.
We purified a partnership from a partnership from a microbial special special special.
The two are many of the people are the topis.
We have added a few genes in a way that we could decide what to choose for this chromosoon.
And then I skip up with enzymes so that they kill all the proteins.
And when we put it in the cell was stupend -- and you will open our graphic sophisticatos -- the new chromosome, the new chromosome,
And we were really thinking we couldn't go to it three, but we tried to get us more than that.
This is one of the greatest mechanisms of evolutionary evolutionary one.
We found that many species have added a second or a third chromosome, or a third of a few parts, add in a second thousands of new trats tracking that species.
So who think about evolutionary as a gene of the way you do not understand most of biology.
There are enzymes called restriping restrictional is that even digestimate DNA.
The chromote that was in the cell doesn't have one.
The hell phon-the cell phone-tail we inserit--a-a-of-tail.
And it turns out and recognized the other way that summer as a summer material as a summer material as a cell material and the new chromote with just the cell and the new chromoon.
It became blue because of the genes we have insert.
And in a short of time, all the characteristics of a species have been lost and then transformed all in a new new software that we put in a new software that we inserted in the software that we inserted in the cells.
And all the proteins have changed, membranes have changed, and when we read the genetic code equipment what we transfer to you transfer it.
Now, this could look like genetic alchemics, but we can change things in a pretty substantial way.
Now, I already explained that this is not talking about genesis -- but to progress from three million and a half million and a half million evolution, and I already said that maybe we're going to create a new version of Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosion of this digital process.
Why do I do that?
I think it's obvious when we think of our needs.
We're going to spend six and a half billion people to nine billion in the next 40 years.
Just to give an example: I was born in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for every one in 1946; 40 years, 40 years, there will be four years, there will be four to the planets.
We're going to find out the cob, fresh water and cleaner, medicinal and drinkle for six and a half billion people.
It will be even more hard to do it for nine billion.
We use more five billion carbon dion, more than 30 billion of the olium barrels of olium barrels of the olium barrels.
That means a hundred million barrels a day.
When we try to find biological processes or any kind of process to replace them, it's going to be a huge challenge of me.
We have to keep in the delivered CO2 from these materials that end up in the atmosphere.
And in today, because of scientific discoveries around the world, we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I like to think that are the designed for the future.
The electronic industry has only a dozen about components, and think about how many different things have come out of them.
Our limits here are principlely biological reality, and our imagination.
We now have some techniques that thank these symmett-ext methetic patterns.
We can build a big robot that can produce a million robots a million chromosomes a day.
Think of process, these 20 million genes or to try to get these 20 million genes to produce either either or pharmaceuts, we can change -- we can change through a little team, and moleculing molecular biology now that in the last 20 years of science.
And it's just a standard selection section section.
We can chance of survive and chemical survival or carbon diogic vaccines.
This is a instantanea few software programmed to we're working to be able to sit and design species to be able to sit and design species to the computer.
Well, we don't need to know how they will do.
We know exactly what their genetic code --
We're now focusing on fourth of fourth generation.
You also saw you that you get hit from the grassrole of was a male experiment.
We have carbon on depending on the generation that will come up enough enough to the higher as the upper carbon as the either as the either as the either either as a chang or different kinds of throwing the skills or different kinds of throwing the upper device.
But the only way biology can have a great impact without increasing the cost of food and limiting the cost of food and limiting the delivered the deal of the CO2 cells that we are working to design cells that can achieve this purpose and we could get this purpose and we could get this purpose in about 18 months.
The sunlight combined with CO2 is a methodo; but in our discoveries around the world, we found different methods.
This is a organism that we described in 1996.
It lives in the deep, about 2,500 feet of deeplety to the water.
It creates meter from CO2 molecular hydrogen, like molecular energy.
We're trying to figure out if we can get CO2 to CO2, which can easily be transportated with cancer, convert that CO2 in order to drive this process.
So we think we could be able to increase what the basic question of what the basic question is, what the life." And we have the modest of replacing the whole petrochemical question of replacing the whole petrochemical industry.
Exactly. If you can't do it from TED, where can you do it?
It would be a main fundamental source of energy.
And so we're working to use the same methods to create instantanes.
You saw this year with the flu and we are always behind a dollar and a dollar dollar, at least when it's to find the right vaccine.
I think what you can change in a combinable vaccines in anticipy.
So that's how the future could start changing, now, the evolution, accelerating evolution, accelerating evolutionary with bacteria -- and finally finally hoot-like like the future of the eucarian otic cells.
We are so so much from improving people.
Our purpose is to do so much to try to try and make a flow-up to try and do it. Thank you very much.
And before I will show you the most quickly possible, a few fundamental jobs, the new technology that we took to Microsoft to a water water, a year aquencies.
It's a local environment where you can interact with is a local level that remote with a huge amount of visual data here.
We're seeing a lot of gigabytes, and we are seeing digital picture with a kind of coast, and it's continuing to a speed sandwiring the images as we want.
And it doesn't matter how big the amount of information we see, how big these collects are great about the data or images.
Most of them are digital photographs, but this is a scan-scan-up from the Bioto the Library of Congress, and it goes into the leg.
It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that the predicts the system of a system like this is the number of pixels on your screen in any moment. It's also a very flexible architecture.
This is a whole bit of data is not images.
This is Dickens. Every colony Casa capitulate capitule.
And to show you that it's just about testing and not images, we can do something like this, to do something like this, to see really it's a real representation of the head, not a photos.
It could be a little artificial way to read an electronic book.
Not I don't advice.
This is a more realistic example of this is a number of The Guardian.
Every picture is the great beginning of a selection.
And it really gives you pleasure and the beauty experience of reading the real version of a magazine or of a magazine or a fifth of a meeting.
We also did something with the corn's Child's particular number of The Guardian.
We created a higher advertising advertising -- much more than you use in a normal normal publicity -- and we put you in a normal content -- and we inserted content content content content contain.
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile, you can see here.
Or other models, or even specific specific techniques.
And this really demonstrates some of these ideas to get the limits of space on the screen.
We hope that this guy to put in a few of pop-up to a few pop-up to other door to be necessary.
Of course, the maps is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology.
And I don't want to lose time, if not to say we have contributing to the field.
These are all the streets in the United States overs above a geospatial image of NASA geospatial of the NASA geospatial of the NASA geospatial of the NASA geospatial image of the NASA geospatial image of the NASA geospatial of the way of the NASA geospatial of the
So now we're going to go to something else.
This is actually from the whole whole web; you can go to the webs; you can see it up.
It's a project called Photosynth, which fights two different technologies.
One is Seadragon and the other is a very interesting visual computer in Noah Snavely, a student of Washington, with the help of Steve Seitz UWashington, with Steve Seitz UWashski of Microsoft Research. A great collaboration.
And it's from the web, and it's been in Seadragon on the web,
You can see it when we do this kind of screen that, where we can go from one image to the other and have this kind of experience to be able to be the multiply.
But the space collocal images here has actually a meaning.
The tremendous visualization of computer have recorded these pictures together, so that they correspond to the real places, so that the imagines -- all of the way the stunk to the Human Frassi on the Countained on Montagreed -- you see the elements of a stable slide-stable slide-st-star slide-st-the-scale and these things have all linked to space.
I don't know if I have time to show you a few more environment.
There are some more space than that.
I want to go directly to one of the original set of Noahs -- and this is from a precent prototype of Photosynth that we did for the first time last summer -- to show you what I think is really the key thing I think is really the key thing about this technology, Photosynths.
We had to worry about the left, and so forth.
This is a reconstruction of Notre-construction of Notret Flickr. Bastern in Flickr. Baster's Flickr and you get images of the camps, and they say, each of these argues around. Every one of these argues argue argument of this image.
So they're all all images of Flickr and have all been linked to this way.
And you can get to navigate this simple way.
You know, I never thought I wouldn't have thought of finish to work for Microsoft.
It's very gratifiction to get this kind of collecting this kind of collecting here.
I think you can see that it's a lot of different types of types of framework in the SLR, a meaning number of the SLR, a meaning number of people in this environment.
And if I can try to look for those most strange people.
Many are blocket and so on.
Something here is a series of photographs -- there it is.
This is a Notret poster Notres.
We can go from the physics of this environment.
The essential point is that we can do things with social environmental social environment. This is now taking data from everyone from the whole collective memory of how to appear to the ground from the view. And that is now now now -- and all those data together.
And those photo become connect together, more than the summer than the parts.
You have a model of the entire emergence.
Think about this as a promotion of Stephen Lawler on Earth virtual Earth
It's something that grows up to complexity as people are using it, and the advantages for who use, and the advantages with use.
Those photo are marked with metads by other people.
If somebody comes the idea of delivering all these things say to the names of Nots Cath's cattedral of Nots Dame suddenly ck of all of those dates, and I can use it as a spot, in that metapal in that space, in that metapal typink in that space, and have a social experience.
Of course, a consequence of all of this are most elaborate model of every interesting part of the earth, collective only by the plane and satellitarian and similar satellitarian and similar from collective.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Do I understand that? What is your software will have to do is that at a certain point, in the next few years, all the photographs in the next few years, all the interest photographs from anyone in the world are going to be pretty much connect?
BAA: Yeah. What is doing is basically discovered.
It's creating hyperlink if you want to do the hyperlink between images.
And it's doing it in the bottom of the images.
And it becomes very interesting if you think of the richness of the sembly of these images are going to be in the same picture.
As a research of images on the Web and the text on the Web page of the Web has a lot of information about pictures of the pictures of the pictures.
Now, what if that picture you connect to all your picture?
So the amount of semant interconnection and the amount of wealth that comes to it is really enormous clax. It's a classical classical effect.
CA: Blaise, it's really incredible.
BAA: Thank you very much.
One of the main pleasant pleasure when you travel and one of the inner of the etnographic research is the to live in the wind, the passages in the wind, the passed in the wind, the stones in the walls today, the flows in the waves of plants.
You know, you know, the skiamans still over the Milky Lattea, or that the wall-old myths of old Inuit are still coloring the delight-to-deal of the Dharm -- to remember the Dharm of the Dharm of the Dharm of the Dharm -- to remember the world in which we don't exist, but it's just a model of reality, but it's just a model of reality,
the following of a particular set of adaptative choicadapted that our stunk has made and mal, many generations ago.
And, of course, we all share tracks of essential tracts.
We all hidden of it.
We are subjects to get the way of started.
We have to deal with dead death, so we don't surprise and whales us and balance --
We all have an art.
What it hits is the particular rhythm of every culture.
It doesn't matter that are the Penan forests of Borneo, or the follows of Borneo, or Haiti, or the Kaisut in Kenya secentrion Sepentrion Curander's heart Curander's heart Curander's heart in the Sahara.
He was my journey in the desert a month ago, or a month ago, or a hallel of Mt. Everest, the Mt. Everest, the mother of the world.
And these populations teach us that there are other ways of thinking about ways of changing other ways of moving in the world.
And if you think a minute, it's a concept that it can give you hope.
Inside, the cultures of the world creating a spiritual and cultural life and cultural life that goes on the planet and cultural that will be the planet and it's important to the benefit of the planet as the biosphery.
And you can think of this culture as a culture as a an ethnoxfer and you can define the ethnoxfer the total of all the concepts, myths, ideas, inspirations, ideas, ideas, inspirations, ideas, inspirations, intuitions from the human imagination of the consciought of the consciough.
The etnos' is the fantastic pathrimonize.
It's the symbol of what we're and what we can be as as as a quisitive.
And because biosphere has been really consumed as it was as much as it was as a hetnote and unfortunately much faster.
No biologist, for example, it would say that 50 percent of all the species is on the bedroom, because it was just fail, or -- in the wide, the most apocalittic fields of biological diversity -- and you don't even near the most optimistic diversity.
And it really really is that it is, of course, the language of languages.
When you're born 6,000 languages on this planet.
One language is not only composed by a launched by a series of gramaticals.
One language is the scrap of the human spirit of human spirit.
It's the half with which animates of every culture.
Every language is a forest of mind, a south, a thought, a ecosystem and a spiritual possibility.
And of those 6,000 languages, while we're sitting in Monterey, at least half is not going to be skids.
They don't get to teach children, which means to say, unless than the she's not a shift something, which are already dead.
What is a more sad of being the silent of being the last talk to a language, of being the last talk to a language, of not how to transmit the shift of admitted or to anticipate the promise of the sons?
This is orring in some of the world every two weeks -- every two weeks a old wall: every two weeks a old wall-up dies in the tomblew the last few weeks of an ancient language.
And I know somebody to say, "Isn't that do it better than this?
The world would not be a better place if we were all the same language?" Benis: we talk all yoruba. We talk about the yoruba. We talk about a meeting?
We talk about it.
You will be going to be a tracked thing that means not we can talk about their language.
I would love to do a trip through the ethnos' ethnosnferaked --
a little journey in the ethnoxfhere to give you a ash of what we're losing out.
Most of us forget that when I say, "different ways of existing" I really mean different ways of exists.
So let's take this bimbaby Barasana, in Amazony, the population of anacony, which creates to the mit of the hats of the snaky in the slk of the sacries.
It's a population that is not able to distinguish the blue color because the celest, because the celeste is identified in the forest, which depends the population of the forest, which depends the population.
They have a strange language and a matrimonic rule -- "exogamics -- you have to marry a different language.
And all of this has roots in the mittle, yet is that in these extremely extent families in which they talk about six or seven tears because of the none languages.
They are just listening to and then start talking about.
We take one of the most interesting tribes with which I lived and the Waorani of Ecuador nords, an incredible popular Ecuador in 1958.
In 1957 mission has tried a factor that has a factor made a facal mistake.
They took the top of the photographs that would take them in a few that would think they were losly dealing that this population of the rain's rain of pluvial for.
They raised the picture from the ground, they were looking for a shape or a shape or a figuring and not out of nothing, they have concloud that was the diavold, and they killed five misionaries with the lances.
But the Waorani don't kill they only have stranimal to it.
They kill with each other.
54 percent of death was caused by their own themselves.
We are rised to eight generations and we found two natural death and when we insisted for saper, and they have admitted one of them so that it has been so aged that it has died agreed to invt the same. And every other people have an incredible knowledge of the forest.
The hunters were able to recognize the animal for 40 steps and recognize the species.
In the early '80s, I was assigned a really interesting job when my Harvard professor of Harvard asked me if I wanted to go to Haiti to intruphic society with Duvalier and Tonton Macoutes, and the Tonton Macoutes, and I could get the shelf of the velended up with the welon the basis.
To make sense of miraculous myself I would have to understand the Voodoo culture.
It's quite a lot of a complex vision of the world.
Very interesting.
If I ask you to tell me the great religions of the world, what would you would say?
Cristianity, Islam, Buddismo, Ebraism, etc.
A continent is always leaved out, you think that sub-Saharan Africa has no religious ffecks to it. And instead of did. And instead of these very profound religious religious concepts of the nate of these very deep-slavery of the slavery.
What makes you interesting is that it makes your life and death is the intense between life and dead.
So you live on the spirits.
And the spirits can be invocated by Grande Aqua, they respond to the rhythm of the dance and they replace the way that for a short that for a short actip that for a short actime-becomes the ded.
So this is why you go to a white to go to close to speak of God.
We give you the time and we get God."
And from the moment that you are possessed that you guys drive, how can you do it?
So you look at these incredible events -- I followed the vast of the tracking time-in-to-in-fied demonstration of the body when it was catalyzed in a state of the mind of the body when it was catalyzed in a state of summer.
And all the population of the most extraordinary are the Kogi of the Sierra Nevade Santa Marck's Santa Marck's Colombia.
And the descendends of civilization that once they lived on the careers of Colombia in the attesa of conquist, the population of the vulcanic massive massive that is on the carbs.
In a continent in a continent in a continent in a continent in a continent.
And at all of today, they are governed by a clack but their formation is decided.
The young following are taken away from the family to three or four years, and they live in a world of buying secret in a world of buying and shadow in the sea ice for 18 years.
Two time of nine years of proposited to reproducing the nine months of managing degrees that spend in the user of the mother, now are metaphorically in the Grande Mad.
For all of this time, they get accultured to the values of their prayers that they previous their prayers and only their prayers and just their prayer -- or to say the ecological equilibrium -- or to say the ecological equilibrium --
In term of this incredible beginning, they have been suddenly taken out and for the first time in the age of 18 years, they see an alba. And in that activity of the first bat, when the sun is the sun of the first balls of the beautiful landscape comes all of his splend. The premise is a past of the splendant to the past is a past of the past of the incredible starting.
"Do I me? I think I have to you.
It's stupend. Now it's now to you protect it."
It's called the greatest brothers and say that we we, threats are the destruction of the world.
This level of intuition is extremely important.
When we think of India's populations and we invote Rousseau and the old story of the wild wild -- which is a racial concept in its simplicity or maybe we invote Thoresu and we say these popular people are closer to the Earth of us.
The people are not feeling ners are not feeling ners from our beolds of ourselves from our algies.
There is no space for these things in the malaric paludies in Asmat winds or the gelies of Tibet, but because of the time and rits, they created a mystic of Earth is not about the concept of being aware of the same as well as a little bit more subtle than the Earth can live because it's only unhappy by human consciously.
What does it mean?
It means that a young man of the Ande that is going to grow that the mountain is a spirit that will lead to the right is going to be a deep human being being deeply, and it will have a lot of different with the mountain or that place of the mountain or that is growing a mountain of the Montana growing that is a mountain of rock that this mountain the war that is a shap of the way that you can get out.
which is the death of a spirit or a mineral core is irrelevant to be a mineral death is irrelevant to be a mineral mineral is irrelrelevant to it.
What is interesting is the metaphor that define the relationship between the individual world.
I grew up in the forests of Columbia Britizubia believe that the forests would be cut.
And that has made me a different human being different from my friends who believe that the forests are believing that the forests are dimora Hukukukukukukuk's death and the channibal beats that live in the world north of the world, beat the beat the Hukey starta.
If you start to look that these cultures can actually create different reality, you can start to understand some of their feelings.
I took this picture of the way to open the Amazon Amazon Amazon Amazon the Ccial Amazon Amazon Amazon Amazon Amazon Amazon Amazon Amazon Amazon Amazon the Sestim.
Maybe some of you have heard of the ayahuas's ill, the most powerful subject of the chamanic repertoo.
What makes a fascinating ayahuas's not the potential for the substance, but its processing. It's made by two elements.
From a hand, this legnose contilying a series of beta-carboline, harmine and harmine molinogeny.
And I take the only plant plant is a fluster that alters a little bit of the consciously, but it's measured with the sheet of coffee coffee is Photridis.
This plant, triptamines, very similar to serotonine, very similar to the night methoxyltryptamine-5, methoxyltryptamines.
If you ever see the Yanomami in the nose that they do from a different set of the substance that are actually a different set of the subject --
Tiring that pole is a little bit like being dissolution of being dissolution of painting painting and landscape on a sea of electricity. Risn: It doesn't believe a distorsion of reality.
I was often with my professor, Richard Evan Shultes, the man who made the psychchchology, with his discovery, with his discoveries in the '30s.
And I think I don't have to be classessed these triamines like hallucinogens because if you're made not telling anyone to be hall." And then the triptamined tripts.
You can just be possible to assume that if you put it with other chemicals that are dening the MAO.
Now is the beauty beta-carbols that are in this lian inbangers of MAO, the same kind of need to potentiate the same kind of a potential for 80,000 species of plants, how these people do are they doing these popular people who are doing these people are going to find two dead-fectime?

But if we ask Indians, they will tell us "The plants talk."
What does it mean?
This tribe, the Cofan, has 17 variety of ayahuas's ayahuas's in the forest, and that we have our eyes in the same species.
If we ask how they are going to ask us how they are going to tell us how much plants, the rest of the rest of the rest of you don't know everyone y?" I said, "No."
The solution is: you take 17 variety in a night of a full and each one will be with a different way of them.
And this is not going to Harvard, but it's much more interesting than to count stams.
Now, the problem is that also is that the ones of us that have heart people who have heart people who are painting them in the brand in some way you can get into the brand of the history of our real real world and spent old.
In fact, the X-century effectively 300 years, it will not reminded for its or technology, but rather like the one was where we stopped and technology, but rather like the one that we were stopped and destruction of mass and cultural innovation of biological biological biological and cultural innovation of biological biological diversity and cultural innovation.
And all cultures through the centuries have been involved in a dance for new possibilities of life.
And the problem is not technology.
Indians have no way to stopped being Sioux when they put on the ark and frecrankly as Americans have not to be Americans when they put from the horse and calyxiety and calesse.
It's not the change or technology that threat the ethnos' integrity. It's the power.
The flight of the domination.
And if you look at the world, you will find that these are not rights.
They're living creatures and dynamics and expended up from existence to existence that are beyond their adaptation.
I'm going to be disbowing in the pathric pathric in the pathric pathric --
a no-made Sarawak, in the East aside, a population that has lived in the forest, a population of the forest to a generation ago, and now reduced to a generation on the reference of the rives and prostitutions of the rivers in the River of the Cinese Meria Cinese Meridional, where the Japanese Meria, where the Japanese navi is illuminate the Japanese illuminate the Japanned.
It is going to fill the staks with the wood subject to the forest.
Or, in Yanomami, are the diseases that have come with the discoveries of the golden of the golden of the golden now.
If we move on on the Tibet, where I'm doing a lot of research, you'll see the harm fly of political domination.
As you know genocide the genocide extinction of a popular popular level, but the destruction of a universal population, but celebrated the destruction of a popul, not just convicted -- but celebrated in cert environments, because it makes part of development.
And you can't understand the Tibet until you get part of the Tibet until you start with.
I have lost the 6,000 miles from Chengd's Chengdu through Tibet in the Western Tibet through Lhasa young college, but only came to Lhasa young college, but only came to Lhasa young line, but only got to Lhasa young line.
6,000 monuments in the policy and ceners.
1.2 million people killed by military in the Cultural Revolution.
The father of this guy was ascritated to Panchen Lama.
And which means that it was killed at the Chinese time of Chinese invasion of the Chinese invasion of the Chinese invasion of Chinese invasion of Chinese invasion of Chinese invasion of Chinese invasion of Chinese invaded.

The sister, which has done the same, it was in re-education.
One day he would, he would, a fasraffise of Mao and it was going to be in this transgression, it was forced to seven years.
The Tibet can be inable, but the spirit of the Tibet is to keep present.
At the end, all you get a choice.
We want to live in the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world in the money.
The great antropologist Margaret Mead, before we died that his greatest fear of the world, is that in our way to this amor-do-and-like vision of the human imagination in human imagination in a limited limited limited by a fire of thinking about the way that there were other possibilities.
And it's humiliating to remember that our species is existed for 600,000 years.
The Neolitic, which has given us the agriculture, which has done us to be able to sock in the seminal of the seminal claim with the classroom proof of the cler's specialization, and we talk about 10,000 years ago.
The modern industrialized world has 300 years.
That sharks a story is not suggests that we have to deal with all the challenges that we have to deal with in the millennia's millenninia.
When these different cultures of the world is asked what to say, what it means to be humans, they respond to be humans, they respond to 10,000 different voices.
And it's in these answers that we all rescued the possibility of being what we are.
I took this picture of the north of Baffin, when I went to Baffin, when I went to hunt whales with Inuit, and this man, Olaya, he told me the wonderful story of his grandfather's grandfather's wouldn't have me been a great story of his grandfather's wide.
The dog's government has not always been giving people with Inuit and in the '50s to be able to be in the 1950s to our our earlier in the colonies.
The grandfather of this man refused to go out.
And family for his life, he took all the arms, and all of his attributes and all of his attrecips.
You have to know that the Inuit doesn't feed the cool --
The slits of the slits were made of fish fly in in caribs.
The grandfather of this man didn't intimize by the art or blizes or the blizartical that was suffering in the article.
It's splplants, he came up with pantalons in a football and defected in their hand. When I did the did it in their hand.
He sprawed on the sheeps of this black slecture, he killed a dog -- and he killed a dog.
He brought the dog and created a brief, with a sheep with a slittle, with a slittle, and he bought another dog on the banky and buck on the best, and of caccepted into the rest.
We want to talk about cable? [Ris] And this, in several ways, [Applausilience of the Inuit and all the Indian population and all the Indian population and all the Indian population of the world.
In the aprile 1999 government has been given to the Inuit -- the total control of a whole territory of California and Texas mitting in and Texas put together together.
It's their new pathy. It's called Nunavut.
It's an independent. It's a dependent. They deal all the resources.
One of the snation-staying example of how a nation-state can recognize with his population.
And, finally, I think it's pretty obvious to who of us was in these remote areas of us was in these remote areas, I realized.
And it's home.
They representing sections of human imagination that they go to the temples. And for us all the dreams of these kids, like our children, as the dreams of our kid's image of the hope.
And we end up to finally, we have convinced that politicians will never get to anything.
We believe that polemicy --
[[Applausive, but we believe that stories can change the world, and maybe we're the best institution, and maybe we're the best institution-the-world needs to tell stories of the world. Every next to 35 million visites.

where the wisdom of all the population can contribute to our collective benefits of collective benefit.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope to call other than you already heard and I'll try to get some links in the case you don't born the hook at them.
I would start with what I call "the official dog."
The official dog?
The official dog's offices of all the Western industrial society industrial society -- "If we want to massive the benefit to be our citizens.
The reason is -- from a hand, in the fact that freedom is in itself a value is in the same one is value, useful, for human beings beings.
The other one is the fact that if we are free, each one can active to do everything that masses our benefit and not no one that decide our well-being, without no one that decide in the name of our.
The way to masses the freedom is to be massizing choice.
More choices people are more and more people are free, and more is their freedom, more than the weless.
This is a deeply deeply rooted in the society that nobody would be dreamed to put it in the doubt.
And it's also deeply in our lives.
I'll show you some examples of what progress has made possible possible.
This is my supermarket is not particularly big thing.
I lost a simple note of the conditional conditional conditional conditional conditions.
In my supermarket there are 175 conditions, without counting 10 varieties of extracting and 12 balsamic whales and 12 balsamic whales that you can buy you to buy a huge constance of constant constance that no one of your 175 reads is of your own 175 ready already is of your own 175 ready have already been 75 ready of your own 175 of your own box.
That's what the supermarket is.
Then you go to the electronic sheep to buy a stere: CD, radio, plast, radio, plast, the CD, radio, plast, radio, plast, printer CD, radio, radio, plast, reader, amplificator.
And in this single electric of electronic electronic components --
We can make six and a half million combinations using the components that there are in one negoties.
You need to admit that there is a lot of choice.
Some of the trucks world of communications.
One time, when I was a child, you could get all the services, to the phones, to the pat that were fornes from mamma Bell.
It was known the phone, I didn't buy it.
One consequence of that, between the other, was that the phone is that the phone is that the phone is not a made.
These days, I went down.
We have a variety of telephone of phones, especially between the cellphones --
So here's the cell phones of the future.
My favorite is that in the middle reader MP3, cut of the nose and the hidden crizing crize.
If you don't have seen it in the store under the case, you're pretty much going to get there.
And what at the end is that people in the stores and this question and this question and he says, "No."
You can't buy a cell phone that doesn't do too much things.
So, in other aspects of life that are much more of the water's living, it means the same explosion of choices.
Butary is not going to happen to be more in the United States that you go from the doctors and the doctor's doctors what you have to do.
Instead, you go to doctor, and the doctor, and he says, "Oh, we could do A, or B." "B" "Be these benefits and "Be has these benefits and risks. What do you want to do you?"
And he says, "Doctor, what should I do with that?"
And the doctors says, "In the benefits and these risks and By these sweeps and these risk."
"What do you want to do this?"
And you can release if she was me, what do you do?"
And the doctor, "But I'm not le."
The result of we call it ""malator of the murn's degree that makes it look like a good thing.
But it really isn't that a shift and the responsibility of making decisions by somebody who knows someone, which is to somebody who knows something, and almost certainly is sickly sick -- and so not in the ideal condition, and so not in the ideal conditionth to make the obvious patient.
There is a huge marketing of pharmaceutical products -- and you would say people like me and you, if you think of it doesn't make any sense, which we can't buy them.
But if we can't buy them, why do you get them in the audience are we going to buy them,
The answer is that they want to doctor, we call the doctor's doctor.
And so the fundamental is that our identity is a question of choice, as you see in this journal is a question of not want to forcing the children. We don't want to force.
And we can reinventing how many times we get aggrade.
That means every morning, in the risky, you have to decide that kind of person want to be.
And in the family and matriages at the family perspective, a lot of time perspective, and it was that he was that he was going to be able to do the most premious possible and it was going to be able to do the most premier possible.
The only real choice was with while, not when you know, and not when you know, and not even what to do after that.
And the day, all of it is really going to play with.
I think of students very smart to a very smart students than a time.
And not because they are not shrinking, because it's not less diligent --
but because I'm implement, I mean, I should marries or not, "should I do do that?"
"Would I have to get to think before I got to think before the care?"
They're all sorts of logiative now.
And they try to answer these questions, even if this implement doesn't complete the company and not get a good vote to my exame.
And they really have to do that. They're important questions.
Now, the work, we're lucky, like Carl underneath it, because technology allows us to work every day, from every day, from every day, from every day, from the Hotel Randolin's Hotel Randolin's on the Hotel Randoline.
And in parents, there's a corner, and he didn't tell anyone where where the WiFi Fi works.
I don't say that because I want to use it.
What is this incredible freedom of choice that we have about work? It's we have to continually decide, and continually in every moment, if we have to work or not.
We can go to the toy toy to calculate with the cell in a pocket in a pockets, and the notebook, typically on the kneighborhood.
And even if they are all spent that we see our child rovince the part, we also asked, "Does I want to answer this call?"
"I have to answer this email? I have to email? I have to email?"
And even when the answer is "no," all of this makes the experience of your game, very different than what it would be in other conditions.
So, from any part of we look at all we look at things and style and style is a question of choices.
Obce the world was this: Obo, there were some possibilities -- but it was not a question of choice.
The world today is the world today is the dilemma is the slightly thing or negative -- "Is it a good thing, or negative thing.
The answer is Scient is Scient Too.
The positive lights we all know -- so I'll talk about the negative of the negatives of the negatives of the negatives we all know -- so I'll talk about the negative side.
And this choice behaviors two actually two initiate effects two negatives in people.
The first paradoxy, is that it produces instead of free.
With many options between the other which they choose to do it.
I give you a meaning example -- a conducted study of volunteer pensions.
A link link to the data of Vanguard, the gigantescicicient society with about a million clients in 2,000 different companies.
What she found is that for every 10 solutions that are going to be offered in more, the percentage of ademic.
With 50 sources of offeres, there's 10 percent in less than dealt when they are only about 5. Why?
Because with 50 founds -- it's very difficult to decide, and choice is going to be detail, and chochoices is remainman.
And I still ask questions, and questions, questions, and of course questions, and of course they don't get it.
You know that not just means that these workers are going to send food because they will not have enough money, to say that decision is so obstic that even the decision is so obsticle that even the fundamental founds of the works.
Not to participate, they're losing until 5,000 dollars from the dator of the works, which would be well to share them.
So the paralysis is a consequence of having too much choices.
And I think it makes the world like this.
"And to end up ethnieternitys: kup, senape or maines?"
You would just take the right decision, if it's for ethnity, right?
You don't want to choose the wrong and you don't want to choose the wrong.
So this is the first effect -- the second is that even if we can avoid paralysis, and we are less reliable by the result of how we would be the result of how we would choose to the way to choose up.
And this for different reasons.
One of these is that with many conditions of the people who you choose and you buy one and it's not perfect, it's easy to imagine that you could have have done a different choices that would be better than the alternative imagined us to be better than the imagined imagined by the decision of choice, and rempiant soddisflit of the decision of the decision of decision --
even when it was a good decision.
More choices are easier to delipe of any details that is insound of choices.
And so, there's what economists call it cheap call it constoxiches.
Dan Gilbert has closely been very well staming the value that we give things to the depends on what we conduct we conduct with them.
And I really, when there are many options possible is easy to represent the alternative attiture of the alternative shoots of the option that is choice.
Here's an example. I got me with all the people that are not in New York.
But that's what you probably think about it.
There is a couple of Hamptons.
A place of left.
Spiping splendid. It's all about them.
Not ladd nothing. But what he thinks he thinks is, "Well, malediption, it's Again."
"All my neighbors in Manhattan are alive."
"I could park right at home."
And it spends two weeks with the idea that it's losing -- every day -- the chance of parking parking where you want.
The expensive opportunity decreating to what we have, even when choice was excellent.
And more are the options that we have to consider the most of the features are going to go back against the opportunity.
Here's another example.
This is a lot of things.
It talks about living the moment, and maybe of living slowly.
But the most important point is that anything you choose you can choose to not do the other.
The things that we don't choose to attractive what we do.
Third point: the spiral growing for waiting.
I tried it on my skins buying a new jeans.
And I will have been nearly jeans.
Once the jeans were just a type, you buy them and west and west, were smart -- were smart -- they were splying a lot of times, they were going to go good.
So, I went to buy a couple of new when the old people went and said, "I'm going to have a couple of jeans, this is my cut."
The committed to me, "You want to slim fit, relaxed and fit?"
You want to look at the while, or with the bottonies?
"You want to be weal?"
"You can get rid or close? Ble blah blah -- he was going to be elencars.
I was stair, and after a little bit of I could say, "I want the guy -- which was the only one guy who was the only one guys like that I had no idea what it was like to be the maleans, and then I came out of the negoti, and I came out of the negoti, with the mit two of jeans I had ever had.
It was the massive choice was the male of the choice I had the best.
But I felt worse.
Why? I wrote a whole book to understand it.
The reason I was worse is that with all that choice was that with my choice were waiting.
I was expected to minim. I didn't wait for no exceptional when there was only a type, but when it was living 100 different places, at least one guy had to be perfect.
What I had watched was good -- but not perfect.
After I talked to the choosing that I was income, in confronted in the waitative waiting.
The add of options in life of people do not increase the expectations that these have respect to the options.
And this will produce less sound as the results are good for them.
No one in the marketing world if it makes it content.
Because if you know, you don't know what I'm talking about.
The truth looks more like this.
"It was better when it was worse when it was worse when it was worse is that when it was worse is that when it was worse it was even possible to meet the surprise pleasant to meet the surprise pleasant to meet the premise of pleasant to evolve.
On the world we live -- opulent to the world expect of perfeeding the perection of perection -- the we can hope is that things are on the expectation of the expectation of the expectations of it.
You never surprised for why the waiting, because your expectations and expectations are ingiant and I got ingiant up.
The secret of happiness -- what you're here -- "Basasasyeah. "Yes, I want."
I mean, little -- little bit of a self-target -- which are really married and my wife is really stupid.
I couldn't do better, I didn't have to do better, I didn't have to do better.
But you know, it's not always a bad thing.
And finally, a consequence of buying a couple of jeans when you have only a couple of jeans is that when you're not satisfied jeans is that when you're not satisfied and you say, "Why?"
"Who is responsible?" The answer is clear.
The world is responsible. What could I do about it?
When you have hundreds of jeans, and you buy a insoddisface, and you ask you who is responsible for you to get in the responsible you're you.
You could have have better better than that.
With hundreds of variety of variety of variety of the insuccess.
So when people get decisions, even if the result is valid, they feel inatisfied and they give the satisfied and they give the same.
In the last few years depression is exploded in the industrialized world.
I think a meaning -- not the only one factor -- not the only important -- of this depression is that people have deludent experiences because standards are too high.
And when they need to explain this situation that the hits it is them.
So the final result is that we are in general, objectively, but we hear it.
Let me tell you about it.
This is the official dog; what we all take for good and it's completely fail.
There is no doubt that a little bit better choice is better than it is not going to have a lot of choice is better than a little choice is better than a little bit better than a little bit.
There is a critical value value of critic, magic value.
But I'm sure we overcome from a piece of the level that the is going to make our life.
Now, from political point -- I have almost finished -- from policies, the nock point of policy -- the nurture, the nurtum is the following.
What it allows all this choice in industrial societies is the material.
There are many places in the world, and you know about it, and you know about that, where the problem is not that they have too much choices.
The problem is that they have too much of it.
So the factors that I'm talking is a malarial of modern bedroom.
And what it makes you depress and angry is this: Steve Levitt talked to you about how those constants and sweet seats are useless.
I mean, these choices, complicated and dispendious, it's not just that they are not just useless.
I'm even deleteries.
They do worse worse.
If a little bit of what in our societies societies can get reversed in those where people have too much chance, it would not be just the way to get their life to improve better but the names
This is what economists call a parety;
A redistribution of income is good for all -- not just to the poor -- because of this choice in except for us to the poor -- because of this choice in a lot.
By concluding, "You can become all what I want,
You know, people in culture, they think about it -- "What do that weight?"
"It's obvious that you can't make anything in a veter."
"One imagination of castred, a limited vision of the world --
and I would also have the whole thing like this, at the beginning.
But then, I realized that that the fish is that that the fish is the long long as a way the fish.
Because the reality of the fact is that if you sent the mouse of it, so that "everything is possible," you can't get the freedom. You get the liberty. You get paralysis.
If you break the mouse in a way that all you can decrease the relief.
You get to get paralysis, and you get the benefit up.
Everybody needs a spher.
This is almost certainly too close to the fish, maybe even fish, and certainly for us.
But the absence of some symbolic symbolic symbolic symbolic and temo, for the win.
Thank you very much.
