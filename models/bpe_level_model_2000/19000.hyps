And last year, I showed these slides to show that the artical calculation of the artical 40 million years has had the size of 48 million years of the 48 States of 40 percent of the United States of 40 percent.
This is under the gravity of the problem because it doesn't show the same, because it doesn't show the same.
The art glacial climate is, in a sense, the heart climate customers.
You can get the wind and wind and the wind of the wind and the west.
The next slides will be a fast-slightly recovered sounds of 25 years.
The ice lots of lots of red.
And as you see, they expanding up to the blue scen.
That's the ice, the ice, which is the wind of the westerday.
You can see the ipiece of the ice ice ice ice glacior five years or floor, is like the blood of the body.
In 25 years was spent from this, at the time.
This is a problem because the interested in the arrain the ocean that reefly around the ocean that are huge amount of carbon and congelate that charge that microbies.
Ript to the totality of the atmospheric scale from global scale of global warming, the amount of not returns out that we don't reach it.
In some of the laghi deeper in Alaska he's already rebowing from water.
The professored professored Katey Walter the University of Alaska team of the University of the University of the wall.
Video: Wow! Al Gore: Wo's well. The question is if we will be even now.
One reason is that this termic scale of the Greenlandlandscape of the northern northern the northern of the northern Sorth of the northermal of the norther.
This is a glacial glacial regime
The branding was never reached levels like this.
This is the Kangerlerlushouse-obest of the Greenland.
If you want to know how the level of the slight-up to the slight-up and the slightly here is where the sea sea of sea half the sea.
These rents are increasinging increasingly.
Another part of the planet: Antarts, the biggest block of the planet.
The months last months have deckared that the balance, and the glacive is in negative, and that the Antarts, which is particularly running in the skin some islands under the sket.

The predictions, like you have the prediction, they were grave.
The growth is growing in the world to a remarkable autiful increases.
The environmental disaster is increasing out of normal and without previous and without previous and without previous and without previous and without previous and without previous and without previous of the normal environmental disasters.
Four times more number of the last 30 years of the last 30 years to previous respect to 75.
This is a sustainable of insustainable to it.
If you look at the context of the story if you can see consequences.
In the last five years we added CO2 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons of the oceans every day.
Look at the Pacific area of oriental Pacific area of the continent of the continent of the continent of the continent of the obvious oxygen in the oceans.
Most of global warming, and the deforestation, together and deforestation, which is 20, is the use of combustic use.
oil is a problem, and the charbons is even worse is even worse
The United States are one of the more emissions, together and the Cina.
And he proponed to build a lot of other carbon to the carbon
But we're going to be a direction.
These are the annulled projects in the last few years and some of the green realternative alternative projects --
At every way, there's a politics in our countries in our country.
The carbon and the carbon and oil have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote the carbon for the last year to promote charbon that charge --
And this image I remember me remind --
Nath Natal, in Tennessee, where I live a 3.8 billion landscape of carbon charge of carbon choories of carbon of carbon of carbon of carbon of the Tennessee,
Maybe you have seen the news.
This is the second largest flow of the scores in America.
It's happened around Natmaine.
The natalizing of one of the carbon industry was this one.
Video: Shype of the carbon is a type and happy.
It's abundant here in America, and it makes our economy.
Frosty carbonic is and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more clean more and more clean the carbon is more and more and more clean is more and more and more and more and more and more more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more
It's precipe, and adorable to work, and the workers keep the stand.

So our priority is to invest a great amount of money in a public of public to make the public and confuse the truth of the carbon the carbon the carbon the carbon of the carbon for the carbon of the carbon for the carbon for
But the carbon is not sport.
We think it's a good -- it has a good profum.
So not predictately, climate change.
Let me do to do it.
Video: Atore: Carbon: You heard about a lot of it.
So let's do we do a game in a framework in a clean to the carbon the clean to choose the carbon of the charge of the carbon the same.
Straordinary carbon! The machines are a little romorose, but this is the sound of charbon-clean to choose technology.
carbon is between the main the main the main the global scale of global scale of the global scale of carbon that you see change.
You look at a charge odeerness of carbon technology of carbon the clean to choose
Al Gore: Infine, the wind positive is to the economic questions and the national security of the national security of national security of national security of national security --
Man: Like is in crisi; the economy, the economy, the economy, the national national climate national climate climate climate crisis.
The move that college all the time to the combuster combustic combustic and the important, as the carbon and the important.
Now, there's a new new audition to us.
We have America: 100-holds energy in the 10 years.
They plan to put America to work, to make it securite, and to help the global scale of global warming.
Finally, a solution that basts to solve our problems.
We have America. Scoprinting more.
Al Gore: This is the ultim.
M: Man: I think about to America.
One of the faster of the faster of the dependence from the combustic combuster that our planet.
She talk, the future is here. Vent, a new energy network.
She talked about the well-insteads of work well retribes.
M: Reat America. It's time to be realists.
Al Gore: A old African proverbble-African proverbs saying, "If you want to go to the money.
If you want to go away to go away together."
We have to go away to go away --
Thank you very much.
The year last last last TEDD, I had a year on the LHC.
And I promise to return to add you to get the car.
So I figure out the other once that the other time doesn't have the other scientific experiment of the scientific experiment -- 27 kilometers of circumsters.
His compiece is to reconditions that were less than a billion second from the beginning of the universe -- to 600 million times a second.
And all of this is simply environment.
This is the underneath of the Gineva.
We have a picture of these mini-Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Big Bang Big Big Big Bang Big Bang Big Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bi-Big Bang Big Big Bang Bang Bang Big Big Big Big Bang Bi-Bang Bang Bi-Big Bang Bi-Big Big Bang Big Big Bi-Bang Bang Big Bi-. . . . .
This is what I work. It's called ATLAS -- it's a 44 feet and has a 22 meters.
This is a space, a spectacular image of ATLAS and you can see the proportions.
The 10 settember year, we have accesses the first time.
And this picture was taken by ATLAS.
It was because of the controls of the control.
It's a picture of the first of the first of the LHC, which was done all the game of the LHC, and spread in the LHC, and spread particles.
In other words, when we see that image the 10 settember 10 september that the machine, which is a great lifty;
I don't know if it was to do us to do it more opening this when someone on Google and saw that the pain was this thing.
That means we have a cultural impact of the scientific impact.
About a week later, there was a problem with the car, there was a sleep, and these movies -- these movies of sleep.
These movies 13,000 prints when the machine works to the massive of power.
Now, technical technical of you look at files and say, "It's not true. I'm files too under the slight."
And they can do it because when they're very fredance of the surface of the surprising files that surface of the surface of the surface.
So, at least 271 degree, to a temperature of the space, these files can bring the space, these files can bring that corrup.
In one of the most of the most of innovemiies in the LHC, there was a fabrication.
So the movies of the movies are read and 13,000 printed and sudden sudden a resistance of electrical resistance of electrical resistance of electrical resistance of electrical resistance of electrical resistence.
This was the result.
Now, this is even more impression, if you think that these magnets fishing over 20 tons of 20 tons of 30 centimeters.
They are damaged about 50 magnets.
We had to take your taken to the point of what we did it.
We have the repristined and justed it.
Now they're returns out all the ground.
Entruth, the end of LHC will be in the LHC will be in the well.
We're going to get it and we wait to get the universe. We expect the data or him, and keep the way our inventure to discover whatever the universe.
Now, of course, in a certain the way, these clustering incident on the science and engineering the science and engineering frontiers.
I think the fact that it's so difficult to go beyond the fact that I think is the value of things like LHC.
I want to conclude with the English of the Ingless, Humphrey Davy, which is the image, in defense of inuseful inuseful experiments of its bleain Michel Faray, disseveral was so dangerous for the progress of human mind as the human mind as the human mind of the human mind as writing of the human mind -- that we are completely not in nature, and the trilleraddress that are completely new world."
Thank you.
I want to start asking you to rethink about here, to a children to go, you play the morning.
And as you figured them and slight-up and slightly them and resolve them and resolve them and resolve to think and solve problems and sending relationships in spaces.
The spacal reasons is deeply connected to the way that we can understand part of the world around us.
So from informed usual informath of our interaction with physics and the Pactic consults, and the collaboratory collaboratory to ask myths, I started to ask my: "And if we use a computer, we use the only hold ind the mouse as policy that is a bad inner to a handle information with a lot of information with a lot of the hand-hand-hand-up with a handle information with the handlapd to the hands of the handlandscaptures of the hand.
and we would be able to food pleased our floor?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer, building Siftable.
In a few words, a Sef is a very big computer-discovered computers.
In a few words, a Sef is a very big computer-discovered computers.
You can move them with the hand, they can see the way in them, to feel the way and have a wireless.
But about, I'm physics, as physics, as the mattones, you can move to be able to deal with them.
The See are the example of a new ecosystem of information system.
And as they become more physics, consciously, the others, and others, and others, and the people that are becoming more physics, and the other way of the motion, of the others, like the motion, we can explore and different type of interaction.
I'll start with some simple example.
This is configurated to show the video sk: if you including the video sken in a direction, if you including the other background.
These interactive rights are consciouss.
If they are interested in what they were interested in what they were going to be it.
If they come circumstomers, and they can agitate a little bit of it.
If they come circumstomers, and they can agitate a little bit of it.
They also have their movement and inclination.
We realized that one of the interesting of the interaction was the power to use the communities of the data, for example, "versation are" as if it was a liquid.
In this case, we have three Seftable configurated, and I can use them to be a central color, where you know, you mix.
and I can use them to use them to be in the central central central central of the color.
If we can get a little bit of a little bit of place.
And I'm also beautiful to apprecienting learning, as the language, mathematics and games where people can try to try to try to be excited things that quickly, and see the results.
Now I'm --
This is a Fibonacus that I do with a program of equations.
Here we have a game of words that is half between Scarabeum and Boggle.
Pratically, to every turn in every turn, the house on every Siftable, Pratratic, every turns out the Siftable, and while you try to get word on a diditionart on a diditionary delands on a diditionary dependition a dictionarie.
And then after about 30 seconds remission, and you have a new set of letting and new possibility of law and new possibility of them.
Thank you.
Here's the children came to the Middle Lab, I did it in the Middle Lab, and I slied a video.
They were very much.
And one of the interesting things about this kind of application is that you don't have to have to have a lot of education.
You just said, "Likey to the words, and they will be exactly what to do.
Here's the other people that tried it.
This is our most youngest teane, there in the right.
It actually wanted to implement.
They just were just him.
Now, this is an interactive application of a interactive card.
We wanted to build a tool for the English language in Lui is Felix.
It can inserve new personages in the scene, he had the Siftable to their associats.
It can inserve new personages in the scene, he had the Siftable to their associats.
So it's doing that sun.
Video: The suntil is source.
David Merrill: Now he brought a treator in the scen.
Video: The arancial treat.
Bel work!
So I was looking at the Siftable and put the neighborhoods can interact the characters --
Video: Bu!
and inventing the story.
Video: Cao!
DM: It's a final story with open-open-in-indeed, and it can decide how you fly do.
DM: It's a final story with open-open-in-indeed, and it can decide how you fly do.
Video: Vole, you know,
DM: The last example, I have the time to show you is a tool, to try to recently and exciting music, to exciting and exeguy music.
is a tool, realized recently, to field and exeply music to exciting music.
The See here are south-based up as based and bacteria.
Every one of these has four different variations, and you can choose that we use it.
You can get these sound sound these sound sound in a comport of comport in your floor.
And modificaring it simply to touch a "sound a "sequence."
These are effects that you can control from living, as the rever,
And the attacks to a particular and then including ssuch and then including it.
And then there are general effects like time and volume, which is apply to the whole sequence.
Let's look at how it works.
Video: DM: We're going to put a basic in two Sift" in two Sef, we add the way in a series, the extend.
Now put a bassyline of bassy.
Video: DM: I am add the percent ussions --
Video: DM: And I'll put the movie to the bacteria, so I can control effect from live.
Video: DM: I can fast the whole sequence inclining the time from one side or the other side or on the other side or on the other hand.
Video: DM: And I'm going to add the movie to the movie to the expression.
Video: DM: I can see the sequence to the sequence to the flight to the flight to the flight to the flight to the "Pose.
So I didn't have to planning the first -- but I can try and provising, make it more or more than the cortask or more corta.
And now, finally, I can get the whole sequence in the left sequence in the left Siftable and the Siftable "volume."
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is build new man-machine machine and more more and more and more more and more more and cord.
And today, I had time to show you one of the results of this perspective of this perspect that we try to bring out of the lab of the lab of the lab of the lab of the lab of this results of the results of this results of the results of this results of this resul
The concept that I want to transmit you is that it's coming this new generation of designed objects to interact with digital media in our world that we want to do information in our world that we want.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the time to talk to all of you.
They're a write writing.
And I reveal books is my profession, but it's more than that, obviously.
It's also the love and the love, and the fashhim.
And I don't expect that can change it.
But what, you know, something particular is recently in my life and my career, that has brought me to recalibrate the entire reporting the entire reporting of this work.
The particular thing is that I recently written this book, this biography called Mangia, Preg, Ama" -- the different books, for some residents in the world and became a big sensational resilial --
And the result is that everywhere that people are treating me as if I was convicted to me as if I were convicted.
By -- condence, condanced -- condenc!
They are now all worried and said, "You can't be fear to be able to be able to do better?
You can't fear to write to write all the life without could be able to create a book that a book that can important somebody to be able to do anyone that can be able to someone that can be able to do this?"
that can be to matter somebody else that can be to matter somebody that can importing somebody that can importing to somebody that can importing somebody to matter somebody can matter somebody can matter somebody els?"
It's running absolutely resure you know.
But it could go worse about the way I remember 20 years ago, when I started to say people -- I was a adolescent -- I wanted to be a tric.
I meet in the same reaction of the same reaction.
And people said, "Don't do you get that success?
Don't fear that the human human refurther than the refer of the refurther than the refurther refurther than the refurther refurther than the refurther refurther than the refurther of the refurther of the refurther than the refer of the refurther than the wall.
You don't have to do this mester to do this mestyself up the life without snothing that ever came and dig dig out of a heart climate charge with the mouth of the camplens?"
So you know, you know.
The answer -- the short of all these questions is, "Si."
I fear of all these things.
I always had the wrong.
And I also fear of many other things that people could not have to ine.
As and other things that are splight.
But, as I think about the writing what I thought and I wonder to be the last mine.
Is it it do?
It's logical that anybody to expect to be expect by a work that you feel that you feel up to do.
But what is that particular in the imprese creative impresely about the mind of the mind of the mind of the mind that other careful than other carries not to do it?
How my father, for example, he was a chemistry and I don't remember one time in his 40 years of the activity that was asked if it was asked if it was asked if it was a waving capit?
There was no long, that block of the John, how well you wouldn't this?
It didn't work, thy it happened to the skill it work?
Enestly, the engineers like group as group don't have certainly certainly in the reputation of being alcolized to be alcolized in depressive.
We writers, we have enough this reputation, and not only writers but creative of every generation, we have this reputation of being huge being enormously instable.
And it's not rest that look at the tristers of the dead of the magnant deaths of the magnitude of the wind century, they have young and often to them.
And the ones that don't have suicide seem to be really disddone by their woms.
Norman Mailer, before he did, in the last interview said, "Ogni book me a little more extraordinary than the work of the rest of the reporting of the work of life.
But we don't bad when we hear it because we heard these things that long as we were completely interiors that we were completely interiors and the nation that the notion that the non-real-suffering suffering and the art, and the end, and finally, it will always get to the anancial angoing.
And the question I want to ask all of this idea? I go to this idea?
It comes up with this thing -- because it looks like a centimeter of distance to me not good for anything this suppose.
I think it's oded.
And I think it's dangerous and I don't want to see it in the next century.
I think it's better to encourage our great minds creative forward creative to live.
And I surely know that in my case -- in my case -- it would be very dangerous to the situation of the situation that I heard the circumstances that are in my careera.
Obly -- it looks like, I'm very young, I have about 40 years.
I still have about four decade of work in me.
And it's very likely any thing that would be writing to be right now in the world as the work that was going to be used by the world as a success of my last light.
And I'm going to slave, because we are all more or friends here -- it's probably the most success is to my greatest success is to the shoulder.
Oh, Gesus more, that I think of the way.
You know this is the kind of though, that it leads a person to start to gin the morning and I don't want to do it.
I would keep keep doing this work that we do.
So, the question becomes to become and like,
And so I seed it after a lot of reflections, that the way to work to keep the way to create a psychological cool, ok?
I have to find a way to find a distance of security between me, that I'm telling you that I am to write the reaction of the reaction of the way I was trying to get the next year to look through the time to look through the time in looking through the time, trying to see if they could have the best ideas to see if they could have the best ideas and more sane and security and sane more and sane than to see if they could have the more than the way that I could have the blood ideas and the way to look at the way to get the way to get --
about how to help people creative to help people emotional inerents emotion.
And that research me leading the Grecia and Roma.
Seguith because it was in the circle and then back back to the him.
In the ancient and Rome and exciting -- people didn't look at that people don't look at the creativity from humans, OK?
And he thought the creativity was this spirit about the divine and that came out of a few distant distant distant and source, for the distant distant and unknown away and unknown away.
They were called these demons' inner spirites of creativity "demonics.
Socrrate, you know, it was a skylands that elargiving sage.
Romans were the same idea, but they called the kind of spirit without the body a genius.
And that is great, because the Romans didn't think a genius really intelligent genius was some intelligent intelligent genius.
They believe that a genius was this kind of divinced that a kind of a tremendous entity of the study of a artist, a little bit like the elf, like the elf, and that came out of the argets of the argets of the arb and modeling the result of the result of that work.
Excitial -- this is the distance of the distance of which is the psychological psychological that is protected by your work.
And everybody knew that was so that it working, right?
So the antic artists were protected by certain things, like for example, no?
If your work was exceptional -- you could not get the market, everything that was helped by this genius was helped by this genius to the genius was helped by this incorporary go.
If your work work, it was not all of your job -- it was not a whole by?
They knew that was your genius to be a huntable to be a huntable to be a incapace.
And so the people han creativity in Occident for a long time.
And then Rinascisent came and changed it and changed this great idea; we put the human human being; we put the human human beings and the misteries and no longer leaving space, and no longer leaving the creatures that were detailed by divinity.
This was the rather of the rational of the rational of human eximution and people started to think that the creativity came completely from isharing iar.
And for the first time in history, you start to reference this or that artist as a piuttly today with a person with genie.
And I have to tell you, I think it was a big error.
I think it allows them to be a simple personal simple personal charge as the source and the source of all my mysteries and the source of all my mysteries and ethern it is a film that human-to-to-ga-to-ga-to-ga-to-ga-gain with human sources that human beings to be a record to the fragible and the source of all the bons,
It's like to ask someone of the sun.
And the rest and historical history and creates all these expectations on the performance.
And I think it's this pressure to have the artists in the pasts in the 500 years.
And if this is true, and I think it becomes and now, and now?
We can do it different?
Maybe you go back to a more ancient understanding of the human relationship between humans and creative creatiative to the remarkable to the ancient understanding of the human relationship between humans and creative to a very much more than humans and I was creative.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we can't cancelling 500 years of rational thinking about a 18 minutes.
And you probably have people in the audience that would be reading to suspects of scientific notion that they follow people on the notion that they follow the things that are going to be able to get the next projects.
And I would probably not convinced you all about this thing.
But the question I would like to ask is -- why is that?
Why don't don't think it in this way?
Because it has more sense of every other thing that ever ever heard to explaining the exasperant impredicbility.
One process that I have ever ever been doing something -- so so much fundamentally, all of the way -- you don't get behavior.
And in fact, it can seem to seem completely paranormal seem to be completely paranormal slightly paranorm.
I did this recently recently with the extraordinary poet, which has 90 years, but that has 90 years, but it was a poet, and he said that during his life in the Virginia, working out in Virginia, working out in the walloce, and I heard the walked from the countruth in the walked out of the countrack of the countrys' recently reach.
And he said it was like a type of the air.
And that was rotoling to the landscape.
And he heard to get the ground land the land under his feet.
He knew what to do to do to that point and it was talking to the point and he was going to stay."
And he recorded to and home and came to the house and he wouldn't have to get a piece of paper and a house of paper, and a housed, and a fastonished up in the pay-fast, and he was the page of the paying.
Sometimes he couldn't be quicked, and he was running and he was record, and he was going to get in home and the poetry round through the landscape and she was going to roll through the landscape, and he would have been roll through the landscape, and he was going to roll the "other other poet."
And then there were those times -- this piece doesn't forget it -- there was no moments that was almost lost the moments that was almost lost allowing the time --
So he was running at home and he was looking for the charge and the poetry was in the way it was a matched in the way that was going to go and then he was going to go and hand and and the office hand and the office hand and the office hand the office.
And he was the poetry from the coda and the coda and the coda and the transner was the page.
And in these floor, the poetry would be presented on perfect and the last word to the first thing to the first --
So when I heard about -- it's a crazy, it exactly equal to my process to creatiative process.
Not all my creative process -- I'm not a convict!
I'm a mule, and my way to work is, I can see it in the same order every day, and to go and work and work and work and go to the hold and go up and go up and go up and go up and go up and go up and go up and go up and go up and go up and go up and work on the way to work and go up and work on the same hand.
But even in my head against that I smoking, I slightly meeting against that thing,
And I image that many of you have the fact.
You know, if the work and ideas and ideas and ideas and I could not excited to be able to source it.
And what is this thing?
And how can we relate to us the head and not to do us the head and head and hold us to sani?
So I reduce me to the best example of the contemporary that I have a different day.
We were talking about this, and you know, Tom, and you know, Tom, the major of life was the incarnation of the artist's argument contemporary to control -- to the dominate these species of impulses of creative indeed, and we have these species of indeed,
But then he was a hop at the time, and a day as he was driving on the under autooostay on the highest of the Los Angeles,
He was going to go fast and of a tract track of melodia, that is rearries in his head as the inspiration, elusive and the wish and the wish and you want to know how to take it.
It has no paper piece of paper, it doesn't have a matter, it doesn't have a recorator.
So I started to hear this kind of old annonow, and he said, "The I'm going to lose and the hossessionate by this song, and he will be requires to the skin this song,
I don't have enough good enough and I can't do it."
And instead of go to the panic panic sanic --
And I'll put the whole process and found something completely new thing.
And he just looked at the sky and said, "Scuse, you can't see that I'm driving to dy?"
"You seems that can write a song?
If you really want to exist a more opportunity when I can take care of you.
One of course, you matter to someone else today.
You go to the Leonard Cohen."
And his process working changed after that.
Nothing the work was still nice as a seedle of the work was still slightly so.
But the process, and the fishing ananxiety was released when the genie, the genius that out of the problems and the parently realizing it out of the problems and free to come back from where I came to come back to where it was not to be a whole thing that was an interiored.
But well-culiation, wonderful bizarring a conversation between Tom and the extinct of Tom and extremely not Tom.
So as I heard that story about changing a little bit the way I was working and saved me a time.
And this idea, he saving when I was writing "Mangia, Preg, and the rule, and the floor, and we were all when we were working on something and we can't get it and start thinking that is going to be a dest, and we were going to think that is going to be a bad book.
Not only bad written to write.
And I started to think of designing this project.
But then I remember me about the air and try to get us to the air, and try to get us to the air.
So I sweet, I sleeping my face in the hands and I would get my comments to a room.
And he said, "Sent, whether "You know, both that if this book doesn't be brilliant book not not going to be brilliant not going to be brilliant not be brilliant to my?
Because as I see is I am going to put all of that.
So if you want to give you a better to you and you have to get your parts.
Okay, if you do it, I don't know what it is.
I'll write the same because it's my work.
And I want to do that was recorded to that I today today I have to do my talk, because -- the end is -- the end is -- the end of the North of Africa was in the North Africa, the people who were dancing for the dances of the sacklyard, and the sacross the basis and the basic to the him and the basic hours to the hip of the North of the North of the North of the sacross the sacross the sacross the sacross
And they were always magnificent because the ballers were professional and they were fantastic and they were fantastic and they were fantastic and they were fantastic.
But every top, rarely something happened, and one of these artists became transly.
And I know what I talk to it, because I know what you've all seen a point, a performance like this.
It was as if you stopping and the baller-field field through a kind of bring and was not doing nothing from different from the sun, like 1,000 night -- but all the primal --
And sudden not appears as a human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human one.
But you get from the behind and under the divinity of the divinity.
And when this happened, to the theme, the people knew what was called the name.
They were sent and they were and they started to cant, "Ah.Allah, Doh.Allah, God."
That's God, you know.
She note nates -- when the Mororors the Spapapay of Spana, and they preserve this habitude with their and the wall, "Ah, Allah, Allah, oh, oh, "Oole, oh, whether you can see in the floor.
In Spana, when a nay has done something impossible and the magic -- "Ah, magnific magney, but, buttle, a score, and a score.
And that's great, because we need.
But, the problem comes the day down, the ballering day and discovered that when you go up and discovers that are the 111 of Marteds and the Dom of Dod there is no more.
It's just a death, with the glandscape, and maybe it will never be able to him in the gain that theize.
And perhaps no one will the name of Dod as well, and what is to do with the rest of his life?
It's hard to spread it.
This is one of the most dolorous regnose life that make a creative life in a creative life
But maybe not to be so ancient to be so doubling if you can not believe it, it is the most extraordinary to be being from you to you, you know, you know, you have to be from you to you.
But I just believe that they were in the prester from a prester of this squist of this squist of your life that you should go to someone else when you finished.
And you know, if we think the whole whole change.
And so I started thinking about it, and it is surely as I thought for different months during the work of the book that public book that public book that the public dangerous -- exist of my great great successful diostanding of my great success.
And what I have to keep when I feel when I feel electric feelectric --
It doesn't have to the art. For your work.
He says to presenting you to your parts, whatever can be.
If your work is ball, ball.
If the dive, you know, I would look at the sken decided to leave some kind of wonderful time through your source, for a moment in your heavil, then "Ole!"
Other you have the same ture.
And "Ole!" to you,
I think and I think and I think we have to teach it.
"Ole!" to you, even human him, and he had a human headador and text ttest talks to you to have the whole thing.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
And as I knew about some of these projects on the human genome genome of the new set of gene genomes.
Now we're starting a new lost of the biology and now we started to digitalize biology and now to the digital code of biology, we're going to go into a new fashim of biology, designing and synthesizing and synthesizing and synthesizing and synthesizing lives.
We always tried to do this big questions.
"What is the life that a lot of biology biologes I think they have entered to figure out to seven levels.
We tried to have a different approach, reduced the minimes of the terms
We're digitalizing almost 20 years hour.
When we sequenced the human genome was to go from the analogical world of biology in the world digital the world of the computer.
Now we asked us to regenerate the life, or create new life from this digital universe from this digital universe --
This is the map of a little organism, the Mycoplasma genitalium, which is the smallest genome of those that can autoreplased in the lab in the lab in the lab of the lab.
And we tried to reduce the genome of the genome to create a little bit more smaller than the
We're able to eliminating a hundred genes of the about 500 that are here.
But when we look at the habolic map of metabolic map, it's simple respect to the now.
And I think this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can elimine, a lot of the genes that can bring a live.
So we decided that the only way to progress to progress to progress this crumping components to take some of these fundamental questions.
And so we started the wind of the "Possetic chromother?"
It can the chemistry of provide these big molecules that we never have to create before we never have to create before?
And in my case of business to work a cromomain?
A crummer is just a chemical material material material material material that we have a chemical material.
The speed with that we are able to digitalize the life is growing exponential to exponential exponential that we can deal with exponential to degitalize the life is growing to degitalize the exponential life is growing to exponential life is growing expones.
Our ability to write the genetic code of genetic code, but it's better than the way it is best thrown for.
And our more recently recently recently the door of the exponential curve.
We started 15 years ago.
The process has request of the past review of the first review, first of the first experiments.
But we discovered that synthize DNA is very difficult.
There are thousands of cars of cars in the world that produce small segments of DNA, the long--hand-hand-hand-to-degenerative process of degenerative process of degenerative -- the most errors are along ger,
So we had to develop a new metom to assembling these frames and recording to the errors.
And this was our first tent, he was going to go from the digital information of Phi Ho-20-174.
It's a little virus that battern.
We designed the fragments, effect the recorction of the errors and kept a molecule.
The interesting thing is when we took this piece of chemical material material and we put it in the bacteria have started to read this genetic code and the bacteria and virtual particles to have viral particles in viral particles.
The virals are that are then released by cells, they came back and forth, they came back and have the Elen.
I talked about recently recently with the oil industry was saying that they certainly pretty much as this model.
They have more than you.
We think this is a situation where the software can really build the same hardware in a biological system.
But we wanted to do things more in big things in big things.
We wanted to build the whole chromosome.
They're more than 580 milar code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic codes.
So we thought of the cassets of the viruses, so that we could change the virus, so that we could change the components to understand what's the components of a living cell.
The design is crucial crucial information in a computer, these have to be very accurated.
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 the accuratezation was a error, for every 10 mibasis.
We found out of the gold, 30 error. If we were used that original sequence that original sequence that original sequencing it work.
One part of the process is to design segments that you smother than the 50 letting of the 50 lects of 50 lects of 50 lects to build underneath to build underneath of the smaller that I work together.
We roject elements here.
You probably have you read that we read the phylibring us to the phylibr.
So we think about this is what we have a genetic code genetic code on four literal lands: AC, and T.
Three of those labor of the men together with about 20 friends, and there's a specific order to put the side of the lects.
So we can use the genetic code to write code of words, and siers.
What we did at the beginning was automobile to do it.
Some of the fact that it was not poet.
We designed these segments for simply to be able to unique with the hands.
There are employers that repeat them and put them together.
And we started to assembling the parts, starting with segments of seven my letter to seven the letter to 24 mildle lectly lected to their letter to get 72 miles.
And every step we produced these segments in abundance so that we can square dance to create a remarkable proceded, we will see in a minute.
We're trying to automatizing the process.
So, this looks like the tabellons of a basis of a basis of the basis of the basis of a basis of the basis of a basis of the basis of a basis.
When we go to these very longments very long, more than 100 miles -- they will not grow more directly in Elen.
You get to the tools of molecular biology.
So we have other mechanisms.
We knew another mechanism called recombination called recombination of homology, that in biology to repaid the DNA to repair the DNA chanism of the chanism of the chanism of the segments.
Here's an example.
This organism, called Deinococcus radiodurans, can assrooms three million radiation.
You can see in the southern the southern require the destruction.
In 12 -- 24 hours is reassembled as it was prim.
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do it.
These organisms can be sken to completely so.
They can live under it.
And I'm absolutely such that life existing existing life in space, and you can find new environments of water.
In the NASA showed that this aven.
This is a molecules that we built using these process, just using process, just used the design appropriate design appropriate to inserious of the sgments of the skills of the inserious segment.
The lievils of automatically lievil.
This image was not taken with a electronic microscope with a microscope of rular gar.
It's a great molecule, so big that we can see it with a microscope of the law of the law.
These are pictures that they cover a period of about six seconds.
This is the published that we did point it.
They're more than 58,000 letting code code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code code of genetic code of genetic code code of genetic codes.
It's the biggest molecules of a definitely defined structure,
It has a molecular fish, a lot of handers.
If we were passit with a 10 caratter without space, there would just take 142 pages only to transmit this genetic code of genetic code of this genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the non-transmit code of the genetic code of the genetic code of this genetic code of genetic code of the genetic code
Now, how do we do it work? How can we active it work?
Obvivisual is a virus is a game from the kids.
It's a little bit more complicated when you use the bacteria.
It's just the simpler than the euclean nuclean nuclean nuclean nucleum and you can just get a nucleum and you will be basically the process of clonation.
In the bacterial arms is instead of the cell phones is instead of cells, but we recently demonstrate that we are able to do a cromosome, and a cromosome, and a cromosome.
We can have a micromosome, by a micromosome.
The two are different than the men of the tough of the topis.
We add some gene gene in a more way to decide that we could decide that chromoma.
He has the scientists with the inner and the proteins.
And when we put it in the cell was stupended to -- and you will appreciate our choicato-cycle -- the new cell cell is gone in the cells.
And we were all thought we couldn't go to it, but we tried to go over there.
This is one of the most exmatter mechanisms of evolution.
We discovered that very much species have added a second or a second or a second or a second hundreds of new tracks of new trats of new tratens of new tracks that species.
So who think about evolution as a gene and sometimes that you have no understood part of the biology.
There are the restrient called the restrial restrion is that descripts is that degerising DNA.
The chromosome, that was not going to be in the cell phone is not one.
The cellphones the cromosome, which we inserito-ha.
And it is expressed and recognized the other crum, and it was the mosome, and we were just recovered with only the crum, and we were just recognized with only crum.
It became blue blue because of the genes that we put it.
And in a short of time, all the characteristics of a species are lost of a species of the new species, and it turned out the new species, which we put up in the new species,
All proteins are changed, the members are changed, and when we read code genetic code of ethic code of what we have transfer to what we transfer you.
Now, this could seem alchemistry, but altering the software DNA we can change things in enough sustain.
Now, I explained that this is not park parts -- but it is going to be three million years from three million years of evolution, and a half evolution, and I said that maybe we're going to be able to create a new version of Cambrian explosion of this digital process of the Cambana of degital of the degital process of the digital process of the digital process of evolution,
Why do that?
I think it's obvious when we think about our necessarily necessity.
We're going to go from six billion and a half of people at nine billion in the next 40 years.
I am to give an example: I was born in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet to each other people in 194, in 40 years, there will be four years, there will be four years,
We were doing the problems now to find food, water and cool and a half billion people, medicinal and a half half a half million people.
It will be more during billion.
We can get more than five billion carbon carbon of the olide of barbars.
That means a millions of bars a day.
When we try to find biological processes or any kind of process to repirate and to repirrate and a challenge of the enormous process of the process of the biological process to find biological process.
We have to keep the most of CO2 emission of CO2 emission of these materials that finishes in the atmosphere.
At the day, thank you very much, scientific discovered with about 20 million genes, and we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I like to think that are the design components for the future.
electronic industry, it only has a dozen dozen about components, and think about how many different things came out.
Our limits here are data principlely by biological reality and our imagination.
Now we have techniques of these things that we call these synthesization, in a lot of synthesization, to create what we call genomic genomic combinatoria.
We're able to build a big robot that can produce a million chromosomes a million cromosomes in the day.
Think of processing these 20 million different genes of different genes or to try to get the processes to produce processes or drugs, new vaccines, we can change and a little thelam, and creating biology thelam, and creating biology in the last 20 years of science.
And that's just a standard.
We can choose to survival to survival of survival, chemistry, chemistry, chemistry,
This is an instantly some software software programmed to be able to seat us and design species in the computer.
Well, we don't know that they would be not.
We know exactly how it is their genetic code code code code
Now we're concentrate on the reality of how much generation.
You see that you can see that you experience the sketan's been a mal.
We have a second of second and generation that will be used to be pretty much zone of the zuckero-burons of butanol.
But the only way that biology can have a great impact that is to have a great impact of food and the construction of food and the connect the CO2 in materials that we are working in the materials that we are working for cells to design this discovering cells that can reach the cell that they can reach the first carbon the him.
The solar light with the CO2 is a metodom -- but in our discovered in the world, we found different metodi.
This is a organism that we described in 1996.
It lives in the ocean deep in the ocean deep of the deep ebolliance of the water of water.
It recents the CO2 using a molecular using molecular energy as a source of energy.
We're trying to figure if we can income to CO2, that can be transported tramount of the CO2 in the carbons, to drive that CO2 charburons, to drive this process.
So the short we think we could be able to increase what the question of the question of the basic is Noe, truth" is Now, the real model, we have the oil interior oil industry.
And if you can't do it from TED, where you can do it from TED, where you can do that?
It would become a major of energy.
And we are working for using the same metods to create vaccines to create vaccines of the instants.
You see this year with the year with influence, we always go back to a year and a dollar and a dollar and a dollar to find the right vaccine of the right thing.
I think that that it can change building combinable to change combinable in the ancient anticip.
So that's how the future could start to change it seeming to change it, the tree of evolution, acceling the evolution with synthetic batteries, and infinally cells.
We're at so much of the best people.
Our discovered is to make enough to try to do it with enough to try to do it. Thank you very much.
First of all I'm going to see the most rapidly possible, some of the new technology that we brought Microsoft in the following water in a year ago to a year ago.
It's a environment that you can interact is to the local level that remote a huge amount of visual data of visual data that you can interact with a visual enormous amount of data that you can interact with a local level that you can interact with a lot of visual data that you can
And here we're seeing a lot of gabytes of digital zoom with a kind of a skick and continue, for a panoramic fast, delightly as we want to slightly as we want it.
And it doesn't matter how big information that we see, as a lot of information that we see, as a lot of data or images.
Mosphotographs are communicated photographs -- but this for example, is a scansion from the Bilibrary of Congress and reents in the gamm of 300 megapixel.
It doesn't do any difference because the only thing that the prestations of a system like this is the number of a system on your screen in any moment. It's also a very flexible architecture.
This is a book internal book, for example,
This is the Casa desolath of Dickens. Every sweathers a capitol.
So to show you that is about head and not image, and we can do something like this, to see the thing of the text representation of the head, not a photo.
It could be a little artificial way to read a electronic book.
It doesn't have to be it.
This is an example of the realistic example of the Guardian.
Every image is the beginning of a section.
And it will really give you the pleasing and beauty to read the version of a lot of a quote or a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of middle of a lot of meeting.
We also did something with the corner of this particular number of the Guardian.
We had a high-resolution, and it was high-resolution, more than the one that is used in a normal normal -- and we have inserve in a normal content.
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile, you can see here.
Or other models, or even the specific specific characters of techniques.
And this really demonstrate demonstrate the limits of the space, the limits of the screen.
We hope that this means to put pop and the pop-up and other porcharges and other porcharges that we have to be needed to be needed to be able to do it.
Of course, the maping maping is one of the most obvious applications of technology.
And on this is not to lose time, if we don't say that we have contributed to allow in this field.
These are all the streets in the U.S. It was a geospatial image of NASASA.
So we spend something else we go to something else.
This is actually actually from the webs; you can go to the web; you can see it.
It's a project called Photosynth, which is two different technologies.
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual research of Noah Snavely, a student of the University of Washington, with the aid of the U.K. and Rick Steve Seitz of Microsoft and Rick Szelisi Ricsoft and Ricchemorchrosoft
And it's from Seadragonononce from Seadragonon.
You can see it when we do this kind of screen that kind of screen that you can spend one image of the type of the multiple.
But the spacal collocar of the images here has actually a meaning.
The Goritms of the computer have recorded these images together, so that they recorrespond to the real-up and the real-up and the real-up slightly the Grass on the Monttags of the Roccipans on the Montttages of a slide-show of a slide-show of a slide-show of the things that are all the things are all the college of the space.
I don't know if I have time to show you some other environment.
There are a lot more space.
I want to spend the name of the original data set of Noah-- and this is a previous previous protynthosynthosynthnish -- to show what the first time -- to show you what I think is really the key to show what the chiem is really the chiem in this technology, Photosynth. And it's not necessarily to look at the web.
We had to worry about legal aspects and saw it.
This is a Notrebuild-cedral rebuilding Notre-slips to Flickr. Basta Dame in Flickr and you get images of types of the types of the top of the top of the field of these construction of the arangered -- one of these constructs of these constructs of the model.
So I have all picked up from Flickr and have been colleged in space,
And it's possible to navigate in this simple.
You know, I would never have to end up to working for Microsoft.
It's very grative to receive this kind of painting here.
I think you can see that it's a lot of different kinds of different kinds of fun slight: from the Mons of the cell phones of the MRessional number of these type -- a matter of these environment.
And if you can try to try to try to try to seeing the stranger.
Many of them are block from eas, etc.
And in some of the here is a photographs of photographs -- etch of a photographs -- et.
This is a Notrecordlype of Notrecordly.
We can go from the poster to the physics of this environment.
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment. This is taking from all the way -- the whole collective of how the Earth of view -- and college of view -- and college all of those data together.
All of those pictures become colleged together, most of the same.
You have a model of the land that emerging the land.
Think about this as the Stephen Lawler in the virtual Stephen Lawler on Earth
It's something that is that grows in complexity as people using it, and the vantages for who uses for those who uses for the use of the use of us.
Their pictures are marched with other people.
If somebody is the idea of contransporting all these guys says the name of Notre-Shydden Notrechems to be rechips of all those data, and I can use all of those data, and I can use the engineering in that universe, in that universe, using the midddle of the cross-mok-to-to-s-moks.
Of course, a consequence of all that are extremely elaborated virtual models of the Earth, not only only as the airplane and images and images and satellitaries and similar memory of the collective memory of the collective virtual --
Thank you very much.
Well Anderson: I realize? What your software will connect us to do is that in the next few years, all the photographs -- all the photographs shared by all the world will be practically colleged with everybody in the world will be practical in the world will be practically college.
BA: Yes. What is doing is doing in practice is discover.
She creating hyperline, if you want to get hyperline, between images.
And it's doing the basic content.
And it becomes very interesting if you think about the recharge of information that many of these images that many of these pictures that many of these pictures of these images that many of these images that many of these images that many of these images that many of these images that many of these images that many of these images that a lot of these images of these images of these images of the images of these images.
And as you do a research of images on the web, and the head of the web to the web and the web on the web of the pictures of the pictures of the photos.
Now, what if that picture is a picture of your pictures up all your picture?
So the amount of the interconnection of seeding the amount of reckets that is really enormous effect of the retless.
CA: Blaise, it's very incredible.
BA: You thank you very much.
One of the principlal when you travels and one of the research of research is the power in who didn't have the antidition to the wind of the traditions, between the wind in the wind of the past, the touch of the place and the drops of the plants and the plants of the plants of the plants of the plants of the plants of the real-forget of the research of the past.
Basti thinking that the sciamans have still beyond the Mily Lattea, or that the My of the ancient of the ancient sons are still colmyths of the Deat, or that in Himalah of the Dharmal the importance of the importance of the anthropologia, to remember the world in the anthropoloy, and the idea that we live not exists in the world of reality, but it's just a reality.
the consequence of a particular choices of adapaptops that our stirps or malf generations.
And of course, we all sharing the essential trately.
We all all came to the way we procreive.
We're subjects to reach the initiation.
We have to deal the inexorability to dead the morting, so it doesn't surprising and balloons --
We all have a art.
What the way that colors is the particular song, the way of the dog, the way of every culture.
It doesn't matter that they are the "the Borneo, or the Saharan Deo Voodoo of Haiti, or the Kais: the Kaiset, the Curanderrior, Curanderrior, Curandl, or a mely,
He was my journey of the journey in desert a month, or a month, or a hyak in the vallases of the Everest, the demother of the world.
All of these populations teaches us that there are other ways of thinking about other ways of thinking about other ways of thinking about other ways of thinking about the world.
And if you can give a moment, you know, it's a concept that can give you hope.
Insieme, my myridge cultures of life and cultures of life and cultural life that is important for the well-being that the planet and it's important for the well-being of the planet as the ragnatebiological ragnant as biosphers.
And you can think about this rather cultural cultural cultural ethnos: and you can call the ethnos; the total amount of all the conceptive -- inspirations, inspirations, inspirations, inspirations, inking inspirations, inking indeed,
The etnixphere is the fantastic remonurimonug.
It's the symble of what we can be as a species of what we can be as a species of what inquisist species.
And as the biosphere was gravely consumed higher is happened to the etness, and purposes very much more quickly.
No biology, for example, it would say 50 percent of all the species was or the extinction of the extinction of the most apocality, or -- in the most apocality, in the most of the biological different biological diversity -- and you don't have any nearly needed to have a popular power -- the of the cultural diversity -- the of the cultural diversity -- the of the most of the cultural diversity -- the most of the biological different biological diversity -- and that is not a badvert of the
The indict of all of the language, of course, the language.
When you were born, they were born, 6,000 languages on this planet.
One language is not just from a vocabulary or from a series of rules of rules.
One language is the human spirit of human spirit spirit of human spirit spirit of human spirit language.
It's the middle with which the animation of every culture comes in the material.
Every language is a forest, a wish forest, a wine, a spiritual system of spiritual possibilities.
And those 6,000 languages that are sitting here in Monterey, at least half the half is not sussurfing in the ears.
They don't come more teached to children children, which means not to field something, that are already to be able to be able to die.
What is more trister than the way of being volved by the slence, to be the last to talk about a language of the wisdom or of the wisdom or of the children or of the children?
This is a founded for someone in some part of the world every two weeks of the world every two weeks and a basic skombs and with a languages of a anthic language.
And I know someone of you will tell "It's not better than this?
The world would not be a better place, if we all talk about the same language?" Bensyn, we talk all all the way we talk all all the way we talk to the cants.
We talk to kog.
Scoprise of a tract of what it means not to talk about its language.
And I would like to do you a journey through the etnifera's sferam --
a little journey in the etnsynthesis of what we're lost to give you a little journey.
Many of us forget that when I say that when I say "different ways of exister" inting existers.
We take for example, this bimbo Barasana, in Amazonia, the popular of anony anonda, that creates the bad of the analysis of the best bad in the skin the skets of the bad sacris.
It's a popular popular that it's not able to distinguisn't to distinguisn't because the chelests is identifed in the forest, which is identify in the forest, which depends on the popular popul.
They have a strange language and a matrimonial rule, "English language language that the language that talks about a different language.
And all of the mitological mythological past, all the particularity is that in these family expensive, which are there or seven language because of the language of matrimons s nobody in the language.
They listen to listen to and then they start talking about.
We take one of the most interesting tribes with which I lived with who's Ecuador of Ecuador Ecuador that has been able to the first contacts in 1958.
In 1957 mission of the mission of the commercial error.
They made up from the high-dimensional half that they were running in the waving of the plug forest, that this popular population had never seen anything that was never seen nothing of the size.
They collect the photo the research of a form or a figur, and a figur, they have no swim, they have concluses that was the diold, and they killed killed with the five lances.
But Waoranananananans didn't kill the strangers.
They kill the way of them.
54 percent of the mortality was because of their mortality was because of them.
We have been well-generations, and we found two natural cases of natural cases of course, and when we insisted that one was instead, and then they have mythmed it was instead, and then they killed it down, and then they kill it it has a knowledge of the forest.
The cactors were able to recognize the animal from 40 steps and recognize the species.
In the first 1980, I was assigned a very interesting compiece of interesting when my professor Harvard was asked to go to Haitites between society to the base society of the power of Duvalier and Tonton the power and Tontonton the power and Tonton the glands.
To sense to the miracle of miracle, I should understanding culture Vodouble.
It's pretty much of a metaphalf of the world.
Many interesting.

She sent the ancivilization that once they were living on the cararibon the Colombia in the Colombia in the conquering of the conquering bailing on the planurcharging plane plane on the carbon plan.
In a blood continent charge, this popular popular continent was never conquer by the spagnow.
And so that today today, but their form.
The young people followed up to the family and three or four years, and they lived in a world of the glacive and bombs in the glaciers for 18 years.
Two name years of nine years of proposing choices to reproduce the nine non-gestation gestation that they turn into the mother, now are metaphorically in the Grand.
So all the time, they are acculated to the values of their society, values that their predicts and only their pregain and only their pregain and their balance, or to say the balance, equilibrium.
At the end of this incredible initiation, they came out and sudden out and for the first time in life in life in the age of 18 years, they see a albath. And that active consciousness of the first wrong walls of the beauty of the beautomootive landscape in theory is all the walls of the beautomat, all of the walls of the beauty, all of the wings of the badelivers:
"Do you ask me how I said, "Do you have to do it.
It's stuff out of you protect it."
They call the brothers and they say that we have the brothers of the world.
This level of intuition is extremely important.
When we think about the inner populations and environment we would have Redwild Redwild history of the nururban concept in its simple or maybe we wonder these populations are more closer to the Earth of the Earth of the Earth of us.
The indegenes are not sentency is unfood from our algic algain from our algia.
There is no space, for these things in the malarian of the Asmsmall or in the gelies of the Tibet, but of the time and they created a mystic of the Earth doesn't have to be concept in the concept of the Earth can live and the concept that the concept that the Earth can live because it's infuses of the human consciously needs from the consciousness.
What do you want to say that?

Maybe some of you have heard about the ayhuasca, the most powerful repertorial repertorial repertor of the sciam.
What makes fascinating the ayaxy is not the potential to the machological powerful drug, but its elaboration. It's composition. It's composition.
On one side, this liana landscape of beta-carbon of beta-carboline, and harm, law of slightly hallucinogen.
Prending the suntil is a blue bluear that alter, a little bit of the consciousness of a family of the family of the family of the family of the chop of the family of the chotria.

If you ever see Yanomami to the nask for the sustance that they do from a different species, and species, it is a different species, and species, it contive methodmethodmethod.
Tird that police on the nask is a little bit like being sparked by a little bit like being a smoke and the charges and the charges and the electricity. It doesn't creates a distorm of reality. It doesn't creates the dissolution of reality.
I was often I was often with my professor, Richard Evan Shultes, the man that has shot the psychedel, with his funglics in the '30s in the '30s in Mexic Richard Evan in Mex.

Now it's the beauty of the bolin-carbon that is in this lian inbitors of MAO, the same kind of needed to powerful triam. The question of the sources of the sources of floor, like these are they doing these popules that are going to find two morefforts of the bins that is such a biochemistry that is that is such a very very very biochemistry that is that we have a lot of the particular to the particular to the source the samplate?
We use the great euphyemism and of error, that can reveal to be revealing to be revealing it.
But if we ask to the Indians, they will tell us "The plants speak to us.
What do you want to say that?
This tribes more, the Cofan, 17 variety of ayaasca, that they were born, and that our eyes are born.
If we ask the how they were all the way their tassonoms will tell us "I think I thought I understand plant, I think about the rest of the rest of the No."
The solution is, you get 17 variety in a different night of a different side and a different tunk of a different tun.
With this is not usurea Harvard, but it's much more interesting than to content.
Now, applausize, the problem is that the problem of us that have the popules of the inner -- but some way you can reduced the margases of the story of the real-world real-in-world real-in-world real-in-history.
In fact, 300 years, 300 years, it will not be remember the wars or or the innovations, but rather like the technologic that we have stopped and enhabled abor or we have been active and habstrongly accepted destructions of biological diversity and cultural biological diversity of the planet.
All the cultures through the century of the several skills in a new way of life.
And the problem is not the technology.
Indians don't have been stopped to be Sioux when they put out of the Americans and so freck as Americans don't have been able to be when they have put Americans out of Americans and bitself.
It's not the change or the technology that they threat the integrity of the etnfera.
The flight of the domination.
And if you look at the world, you will discovered that these are not cultures to disappear.
They're living creatures and dynamics out of the existence that they go over the existence of the instance.
And you know, you can see the patria of the guy --
a popular popular popular now, in the south of the asian that has vised free forest, and then reduced to a generation -- and now reduced to the service and the reflows to the river, where you can see the bowling of the bowlems to be the booth, where you can see the horor, where the navoid the Borneo Bory too the horizonts, where the navoid the horizonts,

If we go on the Tibet, and you can see a lot of research that you see the during the policy.
As you know the genocided, the physics of a popul, is convicted in universal level of the universal life of the style life of a popul, not only is not just convicted in certain the environment, not only is conditive, because part of the strategy.
And you can't understand the Tibet of the Tibet until you get out of the beginning.
I realized 6,000 miles from Chinches in the Western Cina in the Western Cina and the southern with a young college, but only came to Lasa realized and I figured out what we heard about it.
6,000 world-sacred sacred sacred sacred and energy and energy.
1.2 million people killed by the Cultural Rvolution of Cultural Rvoluion.
The father of this guy was ascriting in Panchen Lama.

One day, he was very woman was a hot standing Mao Mae, for this transgression of Mae, this transgressips for seven years.
The Tibet of the Tibet can be unable, but the spirit of the population is keeping --
And finally, everything is reduces a choice.
We want to live in the world, or we want to live the world or we want to act the policromath of diversity?
The great anthropologa Margaret Mead, before he died her greatest country was that in our movie, in our movie, we don't just see the whole gam, we don't just see the whole gamma of human imagination of the human imagination of the human imagination of the human imagination of the human imagination of the human imagining of the human imagining of the modality of the hump.
And it's a biggesting that our species is existed for 600,000 years.
The Neolitical Rvolution that has done us the agriculture, that has done us to the cult of the seeds, sustituating the poetry of the skin with the skin the skin the skin the specialization, and we talk about 10,000 years ago.
The modern world industrialized has 300 years.
And that was not suggests suggests that we have the answers that we have to deal with all the challenges that we have to have to come to the millen.
When these myria's cultures of the world is asking what to be human, they respond with 10,000 different voices.
And it's in these answers that we all have the chance of being what we have to be what we have to be what we have to do is a consciousness and all the popules and all the gardens can physical moment. And there are big moment.
I took this picture on the north of the half of the Baffin, when I went to the hundred alses with the "Man, Olaya, I told the wonderful story of his grandfather.
The government canades was not always gentled with the Inuit and the '50s, to stable to stable our sound our sounds, we have rinking it in colonies.
The grandmother of this man had refused to go and get it.
The family, temple, I was in his life, and he took all the arms, and all of his attreckets.

He got the dog, and created a bunch of the bone, with the cassroom, has created a slittle, and it was skilled on the bananksy, and it's compared on the banks, you know, he's clean in the road.
We want to talk to horse it with nothing to nothing? And this in different way? And this in different ways, and the popular resilience of the popular resilience of the popular resilience of the world.
In the 1999 the California was in the canades of the English control of a territory of the California and Texmyth,
It's the new patria. It's called Nunavut.
It's a territory territory. They find all the resources.
One of a lot of example of how a national nation-state nation-popular nations.
And finally, I think it's pretty obvious to the ones of the planet, to the remote of the planet, making the planet, you know, you connect that they don't remove remotly remote remote remote that is not remote remote that we have been in these remote areas.

Finally, National Geographic we are convinced that politics will never get nothing to get nothing.

which is the wisdom of all the populations can contribute to our well.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some of some things that I wrote in this book that hope to be able and proversus that you have heard and proversus some of the collegments, in the case doesn't notice.
I want to start with what I call the official official."
The official official dog,
The official official of all the Western societies of Western societies, "If we want to massimizing the well-being of our citizen" "The way to be the well-being to the individual freedom,
The reason that stay, in the fact that the freedom is in the same one is in the same a value, because of human beings.
On the other is that if we are free, each of us can agive to do everything that massimizes our well-being, without no one that decided in our namels.
The way to massimizing the freedom is to massimizing choice.
More choices people hand, more free, and most of the freedom, most of the freedom, the well.
So that, it's so deeply radicated in society that no one would dreaming it in the him.
And it's also deeply in our lives.
I'll show you some examples of what the progress has realized it.
This is the supermarket. It's not particularly large.
I allowed a simple named her to save it.
In my surprising supermarket there are 175 conditions, without containing 10 variets of olive olies and 12 acets that you can buy a number of mind that you can buy number of condition, in the injayms of the inner instances of the 175 already already already already to the skill of the balloy of the bals' balskills that you can buy in your slap.
Here's the supermarket.
And then you go to the snegotial to buy a stere: cassasses, slower CD, slettor sket.
And in this single snegotial of electronic components of car.
We can make six million different half million different combinations that there are in a negotile.
You have to admit that there is a lot of choice.
Other the world of communications.
One time, when I was a child, you could get all the phone of the phone of the phone that were mamount of the mom Bell.
He was reading the phone was not buying the phone --
One consequence of this, between the other, was that the telephone is not going to stop it.
These times are gandated.
Now we have a variety of phones, especially illimitated between cells.
Here's the future.
My favorite is in the middle, the MP3, the half of the hidden and the force for the crashes of the crashes.
If you do not have seen in the snegotie, you know, you're going to be able to prey it will be able to reverse it.
And what the end end happens is that people around the negozes and this question, and do this question. And you know what's the answer?
It's not possible to buy a cell phones that don't do too many things.
So, in other life that life are much more important than the water is that the same explosion of choices.
Sansistence health is: not happening in the United States that you go from doctor and the doctor of the doctor of the doctor of the United States that you have to do.
And he wind from doctor, and the doctor says, "Okay, we could do A, or B" "A, or B" is these wells and these risks. And these wells wells and these risks.
You know, "Dr. What should we do?"
And the doctor says, "As these wells and these risks, and this is well-well-well-well.
"What do you want to do that?"
And you can rebate if she was to me, what would do I do?
And the doctor: "But I'm not leight."
And the result of the result of the malato," expression that it makes it beautiful thing,
But it is not that one is that one to the fish, and the responsibility to take decisions to take somebody who knows someone that you don't know anything that doesn't know nothing -- and almost certainly is not -- and so in the idea to take to take decide to take decide to take decide to take decide to take the patient decided to take the patic decision.
There is a lot of marketing products of drugs, I would say to people like me and you, if you think you don't buy any sense, you know, you don't buy to buy them.
But if we can't buy it with them?
The answer is that they want to do the doctor to ask to ask the recipe of changing the recip.
And so fundamental thing like our identity is a question, is a question of choice, as you see in this view in this view of the children. We don't want to force their own sex moment of the right time.
And we can reinvented us how many times we agree us again with it.
And that means that every morning to the risk that you have to decide that kind of person, you have to decide that you want to be.
And I respect to the family and matrimoney, a time perspective to anyone for anyone for anyone for the pretty possible for the pretty possible, and he was starting the most pretty possible.
The only choice was choice was with choice, and not even what do later.
Ogame, everything is really to play.
I set students very smart students and their 20-hard work in less than a time.
And not because they're brilliant not because they're brilliant until less deligent.
But why I'm impensiers, I mean, I would ask to ask me or no? I should do it now? I should do it now?"
"I should be more tardie? I have to think before the career?"
They're interrogative interrogoriant interrogorient.
And they try to answer these questions, even if this implements don't completely the compites that and not get a well-bad vote to my example.
And they have to do it. They're really important.
Now, the work: lucky, as the under of the undertiny -- because technology allows us to work every day, every day, every day, every day, every day, from Hotel Randolphph.
And I go to parents there is a angle and not tell anybody where, where WiFi works.
Not to say that because I want to use it.
What does this mean, this incredible freedom that we have to work in the work? Is that we have to decide, and we have to do or not.
We can go to see our best bad to play the cell phones in a task -- the Blackberry in the other, and the nest non-name teok, on the game.
And even though they're all spent, every minute that we see our son chroad the game, we also asked us to say, "Do must this called the "Do you to this called the ""Do you can see this called the "Do my?"
"I have to be avoid this email? I have to abboth?"
And even when the answer is "no," all this makes the experience of the experience of the very different conditions.
So, from any part of any part of it, things that small and big materials and big materials and big, and life is a choice.
Obce the world was this: Ove, there was some choice, but it was not a choice.
The world today is today: "Islemma is, "Is it is a positive thing or negative negative negative or negative negative thing?
The answer is Sath here.
The slides we know all the negative snegative negative negative negative negative negative skills.
And this choice behaviors two negative effects on the people.
The first one, paralsaving is that it makes paralsaving that free reliberation.
And so many options that the choices that choice, it becomes very difficult to do it.
I offer an example of the significant example of the plans of the workers.
One of my colleagues in the Vanket, the ganti-company of the pension, with about a million hundred chemenses, with about a million companies.
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that every 10 solutions that are offered to the percent, the percent.
With 50 source the offers, there's 10 percent of less ades when they are available only 5. Why?
Because with 50 source the foundly hard to decide is hard to decide, and the choics is remained to question.
And at the questions, and ask questions, questions and questions that questions not to get the most.
You know that it doesn't mean that these workers will be able to the old people to sat for canoes because they don't have enough money, because they don't say that the decision is so ostic that the decision is so ostic that they lose the fundamental place of work.
Don't tepanding, they are losing up to 50,000 dollars a year from the data of work, that would be well in the way to the them.
So the paralsis is a consequence of having choice.
And I think that makes the world like this.
"And finally, for the eternity: ketchup, sense or major major major major major or major main?"
You would take the right decision to take the right decision, if it's the eternity, right?
You don't want to choose the bad source, and the wrong condition.
So this is the first effect. The second is that if we could avoid the parals' paralsatissent and the end of how we will be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be with less options that we would have been choice.
And this for different reasons.
One of these is that with a lot of condition, which is that you would have a different choice, and it's not perfect a different choices that you could have a different choices that would be better than it would be better than it would be better than it would be better than the choice, and the rest of choice, and the relips of choice, and the recoum of the choice, and the recover,
even when it was a great decision.
More choices -- more easy to dispiact anybody detain that is insodsatissfying of choice.
And yet, there's the economists called opportunity.
Dan Gilbert asked very well stamine, as the value that we do to things that we confront of what we confrontive it.
And the way you should be able options to be able to represent the characteristics of alternative and be less soddden satic and be less sodden in the option that you have choice.
Here's an example. I spoke with all the ones that are not New York City.
But that's what you probably think of it.
There is this copy to Hamptons.
A place of lausse.
It splendida. Otype day.
Nothing equipment. But what he thinks is, "Well, the well, August."
"Everybody who are neighborhood."
"I could talk about the front of the home in front of home."
And it turns out of the idea that it's losing -- every day, every day, every day, every day, where you want to go where you want.
The cost-opportunity is declues the soddden soddden the choice was excellent.
And more of the opportunity we have to consider the characteristics will be constantly in the opportunity.
Here's another example.
This view says a lot of things.
It talks about the moment, and maybe of the living of living slowly.
But the most important point is that any thing you choice, you choices you choices not do the other set.
The things that we don't choose have a lot of attactive that can make less attenough what we do.
Tero point, spiral growing expectative.
I tried on my skin a couple of jeans.
I always have to do jeans.
Once jeans were a type of a type and wind and wind them up with a lot of times a lot of times a lot of times and they were going to well.
So, I went to buy a new jeans when the old ones were go, and he said, "I need a couple of jeans, this is my cuteans, this is my cut."
The commen, he said, "Li wants to be slim and slim and slim and slight?"
Would you like the cernier or with the hed? "Stones? "Stones?
"Last streets of the street?"
"Sots or stretch, or stretching or stretching the blah.
I was sleep, and after a little bit of job, and I would say, "I want the only guy -- that was the only guys" was the only one I tried all of the jeans, and then I tried all the jeans, and then the best couple of jeans, and the best couple of the best jeans that I had ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever had.
It was the mas. He's the whole choice had had a best.
But I heard about it.
Why? I wrote a whole book to understand it.
The reason I was worse is that I was worse with the whole choices were altish altis; jeans had to be perfect for the perfect that I was perfect to be perfect for the whole thing that choices had to be perfect that choices were altising to the mys
And I began expectations of minime. I didn't expectations when you exceptional -- when you can just a types, at least one guys had to be perfect.
And what I had water was good -- but it doesn't perfect.
After I was talking about what I was trying to get what I was trying to insodded in confront of the waiting to waiting.
The addition in life of the people don't have to increasing expectations that these have respectations of options of the options.
And this will be less soddefation, when the results are good ones.
Nobody in the world of marketing if you make it content.
Because if you know what I'm talking about, you know, you know, what I'm talking about.
The truth is more like this.
"He was better when he was worse when he was worse when he was worse when he was worse when you was worse when he was worse when you was worse was even possible to meet of surprised pleasant was to meet of the surprised pleasant to meet the surprised place that
Ogame, in the world that we live -- opulent, industry, industry, to expectative expectative to the perfection -- the male things are to the things that are things like to expectations.
You don't have ever surprised because your expectations because your expectative, the mistake --
The secret of happiness -- whose is -- "Yes, you wait."
I mean, little time I mean, I mean, I really have to be sposed and I really get out of my wife is really stuff.
I could not do it better, I don't have to do it better,
But I don't always have a bad thing.
And finally, a consequence of the comfortable jeans comfortable jeans of jeans is that when you don't mean to be sudden and you ask you, "Why are you going to be "Why is you know, "Why is you know, "Why is you know, "Why is you don't have to buy a couple of the
"Who is responsible responsible is clear?
The world is responsible responsible to us?
When there are hundreds of jeans, and you buy a satisssatisssatisssatisswill, is the skilling that responsible for you you to you.
You would have a best.
With hundreds of varieties of available to the success.
So when people take decisions, they also have decisions, even if the result is valize, and they get the same, and they get the same.
In the last years the last years the depression is exploded in the industrialized world in the industrialized world.
I think a meaningful factor -- not the unique -- not the unique -- this important -- this is that people have experiences because the people have experiences because the standard standard are too allow.
And when they have to explaining this situation thinking that the colp is there.
So the final result is that in general is that we have a little bit better, but we feel worse .
Let me tell you about it.
This is the official dog, and that we all take for good and it's completely falso.
There is no doubt that a little bit of choices is better than I haven't have a lot of choices that many choices is better than a popular of a popular popular of it.
There is a critical value of the critic,
But I'm sure we have been sure that we have been a piece of the level that choices the level of our life.
Now, from the point of political political point -- from the policy, the police, the follow.
What it allows all this choice in the industrial society is the material to the material society.
There are many places in the world, and you know that the problem is not that have too many places in choice.
The problem is that they have too poll.
So the face that I'm talking about is a malesclusive is a bad of modern, society.
And what makes you depressing and is this one: Steve Levitt you talked about iers as the constants and comfortable choes for bigs to mbe,
I mean, you know, these choice, complicated and dispendings, it's just inuseful to inuseful inuseful --
They're deleters.
They have to stop the worst of it.
If one little bit of what our society allows to be reversed in the where people have too point, where people have too point, it would not only be the now.
This is what economists call a better paretic paretic paretic to the paretic foreties.
One of the reddden redd-red-to-pover, not just to poor -- because of this choice in excent that you go back to us.
And so he said, "Lole, you can become everything that you want to be --
You know, people culture, you think, "What do you think about the fisherming weigh. What do you think we sheep that fish. What do you think about it. What do you think about the fish.
"It's obvious that you can't get anything in a mouth of glass of glass."
"Augment, a view of the world."
and I was the inition to the inition to the beginning.
But then, I think about that, instead, I realized that that the fish.
Because the reality of facts is that if you sent the mouth of the mouth of the mouth that is possible." You get the freedom. It's a paralysis.
If you rops the mouth of the way that all becomes possible the sodddisfation.
You hear the parals, and you reduce the well.
Everybody need a sphere.
This is almost most stream, maybe even stream, perhaps even for the fish, and surely for us.
But the abce of some symbolic symbolic symbolic charge for the wind rocket.
Thank you very much customers.
