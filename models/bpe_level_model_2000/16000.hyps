And the last year I showed these slide to show that the tyglacial calculat, which for almost three million years had the size of 40 million years of the United States of 40 percent.
And this is a very subvalue of the problem because it doesn't show the beautiful to the glacid.
The glacial cycle is -- in a sense, the heart of the climate system.
It turns out the inverse and returns out of the extremendous expand.
The next next device, it will be a rapid carrying the last 25 years.
The ice ennight are draws in red.
As you see, you can see the blue skets up the blue screen.
That's the ice in inver, which is the glacira that is extremendous reach.
You can see that the cosid-called the glacier perennes, five years or more, is like the blood from the cord.
In 25 years was spent from this, at the time.
This is a problem because the interested in the lands of the art in the ocean artic lands where there are huge amount of carbon and furniture that we want to put it in metan hundred ds.
Rispace of the totality of the inquinte from the global scales of global warm, that quantity could radouble this point of not rhor.
In some of the side of the Alaska deep in Alaska is already reboiling water.

Video: Wow! Al Gore: Some is if we will be not.
A reason this is that this scenes that this exchange the Greenland the Greenland from the northern Groenland from the northern Groenland in the northermal Groenland is that this scale is that this scale of the northermal Greenland is that this scales.
This is a glacial regime of glacial glacial regime
The taken had never reached levels.
This is the Kangererlusuual-ovest in the so-obest of the Groenland of the Groenland of the Groenland of the Greenland in the Greenland in the so-of the Groenlands.

These rents are increasing rapidly.
Another part of the planet: Antarts, the biggest block of the planet.
The month of the scientists have been declear that the balance of the ice is negative in negative, and the Antarts, which is particularly points on some island of the tiny of the wind of the wind of the glands.
Equival to six feet of water six feet in Groenland as Groenland and of the water in Groenland of the water in Groenland in Groenlands.

The environmental disaster is increasing a recording out of the normal and without precedent.
Four faster than in the last 30 years of the last 30 years of respect to the previous respects.
This is a whole thing of the instant.
If you look at the context of the story if you can see the consequences.
In the last five years we add 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the oceans every day.
Look at the Agake the Pacific area from oriental America -- to obs: the west, and on the subject parts of the continent -- where there is a poverimpoor in the oceans.
Most of global warming global warming deforestation, and the 20, is the 20, is the usual usual to combe.
Oil is a problem, and the carbon is a problem, and carbon is perse.
The United States are one of the two countries with the most emissions, together to China.
And it proponed to build a lot of other hand,
But we're going to assister to a change of direction.
These are the projects annonothing in the last few years and some proposites of the alternative res.
At every way, there's a political lots in our country.
The carbon industries and oil industries have 250 million dollars in the last year for the last year to promote the carbon and the charge of the charge of the character.
That image me that I remember me --
Natan, in the Tennessee, where I live a 3.8 billion literal scores of carbon of carbon of carbon of carbon of carbon of carbon of carbon of carbon Tennessee, where I live in Tennessee, where I live a loss of carbon of carbs.
Maybe you have seen it on the news.
This is the second largest flows in America.
It's happened around Natal.

Video: Man: Frosty is a carbon is a kind of happy.
It's a good here in America, and it makes our economy.

Al Gore: So the Allegance for the Proteam of Clima has a two campaigns.
This is a one of it.
Video: Ator: At it look at the climate changes like a minm of climate changes like a minal climate in the business.
So this is to invest a great amount of money in a great amount of money in a public of the audience, and confuses the truth of the carbon the carbon the carbon the carbon this carbon this charge of the carbon of the audienc
In fact, the carbon is not spork.
We think it's a good progress -- it has a good profum.
So not predictately, climate change.
Let me do it at us.
Video: Ator -- you know, I heard -- you have heard about a lot of talking about a lot of talking about a lot of
So let's make a game of the foot in a structure of the carbon for the carbon the carbon the carbon for a carbon to the carbon to the flew of the carbon to a clear structure of the book.
Straordinary machines are a little roten machines -- this is the sound of the carbon the technology.
The consums of carbon is between the main the main the global rescales of global charb, but the night of carbon that you can see all all the time.

They like to put America to work in America to work in the work, to help the global scales.
Finally, a solution that it is solution that it is solving our problems.
Repower America. Scoprint.
Al Gore: This is the ultim.

We need to go away to go away fast.
Thank you very much.
The year at TED fect in the LHC.
And I promise to get to get to the machine.
So I understand that the other time there is no other time there is no erglusters -- the LHC is the biggest scientific experiment -- 27 miles of circumstom.
His compiece of realing the conditions that were less than a billion second of the universe -- until the beginning of the universe -- until the second.
Everything is simply environment.
This is the Gineva.
We have these mini-Big Big Big Bang Bang Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big
This is what I work. It's called ATLAS -- is larger 44 feet and has a diameter of 22 feet --
This is an image of ATLAS in ATLAS in building so you can see the proportions.
10 settember 10 sets have we access, we have the first time.
And this picture was taken by ATLAS.
It was because of immense festerday.
It's a picture of the first of the particles that had made all the game of LHC, ring in LHC, rusing particles.
In other words, when we see that image the 10 settember 10 settember, we can see that the machine works, which is a great life.
I don't know if it was to do that there is a more opening to Google and says that the page.
That means we had a cultural impact impact of the scientific impact to what scientific impact.
About a week later, there was a problem with the machine, I had to have to these files -- these modorates.
These files take 13,000 printing when the machine works in the massive powerful power.
Now, the technical technical of you look at the files and dirance and dige, "I'm not true.
And they can do this because when they're very quickly become the cosids, you can do the surfaces of the surfaces of the surface of the surface.
So, at less 271 degrees, to a inferior to that the space between the stars, these files can bring that corrup.
In one of the most novemila between the LHC, there was a fabrication.
So the movies are read to read read up to read up a suddenly suddenly met to make a resistance of electric.
This was the resulted.
Now, this is more impressionate if you think that these magnets fishing fishing the side of 20 tons of about 30 centimeters.
They are dannegs about 50 magnets.
We needed to top, what we did we do it.
We have the indeed, and add justed and add the right
They're writing all the way to the ground.
Entruth, the end of LHC will be new integrat.
We accenate it and we wait to get the universe. We expect of the data or him, and keep it to find out whatever it is the universe.
Now, of course, in a certain the way, these incident in the fabrict of science and the engineering of the science and engineering.
I think the fact that the fact that it is so difficult to go beyes, I think this is the value of things like LHC.
I want to conclude with the words of a scientist, Humphrey Davy, which I image, in the inuseful of the inuseful experiments of his inuse; his hundred was Michael Faray, said, "No much dangerous as well for the human mind of the human mind as the human minds of the human minds of the science of the science that are not about our trips, which is not about our trials that we have to be completely new money,
Thank you.
I want to start asking you to rethink about here, by kids, you play to the kids, you play the battons.
And while you can reach them and reach them and reality, take them and move them and reality, you learn about thinking and resolving them and hands to think about the problems and hands relationships.
The space is fundamental reasons we understand the way we can understand the world around us.
So, by information information of our interaction with physics, with physics, together, and my consults, and my collaborator Jeevan Kalths, I started asked myself with a computer, instead of the mouse of mouse as the policy that is just a class, we can actually have the degital with a degital with a degital with physics, we can deal with a lot of them to be a handling with a hands.
and it will be our place to our place that we feel it to our place to the place of our pleaseasy?
The question was so interesting that we decided we decided to explore the answer, building Siftable.
In point, a Siftable computer is a whole whole computer interactive as a birth of a couple of a couple of a couple computer interactive as a bird of a whole whole whole whole whole whole of words, a Sift-to-words, a whole whole whole whole bunch of a great discover.
In point, a Siftable computer is a whole whole computer interactive as a birth of a couple of a couple of a couple computer interactive as a bird of a whole whole whole whole whole whole of words, a Sift-to-words, a whole whole whole whole bunch of a great discover.
You can move with the hand, they can see in the hand, to feel the movement and they have a short and a shot and a shot and a shot screen and a shot screen and a screen and they have a screen and they have a screen and they have a short and a screen and they have a short and a screen and a screen and a screen and a shot scree.
But above all, are physics, like mattons, as the matter can move to make it simply to be able to do it.
The Siftable are the example of a new ecosystem of information.
And as a more physics, and they are more physics, and the others, and the others, and as they become more physics, and they become more physics, as we motion, as we can explore new stily and we can explore new stiles of interaction.
And I can start some simple example.
This is configurated to show video -- if you including video -- if you including it in a direction, the video it will be back from the other side of the other side back.
These ritical ritrats are conscious about others.
If they are interesting them in the fact that they are intor.
If they come circumstom, and they can get a little bit of a po.
If they come circumstom, and they can get a little bit of a po.
They also have their movement and inclinked them and inclinked action.
We realized that one of the interesting of the interaction was the power to use the communal power to use the data, to the instance, "versation are" as if it was a liquid.
In this case, we have three Siftable sects like sects of truth, and I can use them in the central central color, where they missing them in the central central him.
and I can use them to be to reversation in the central central clean.
If we can get too much later, we can reput a little bit of place.
They have a nasic possibilities of apprecient, as the languages of logical and games of logical logical and see the results of logical results.
I'm --
This is a Fibonaction of Fibonacus that I do with a program of equations.
Here we have a game of words that is half between Scarabeum and Boggle.
And in the house of the table, a letter on every Siftable, Pratic, Pratic, Pratic, in the house of the Siftable, and as certain the control of the control words on a dition.
Then, after about 30 seconds remissing a new set of lects, and new possibilities to try to try to prove and new possibilities to try to try to prove it.
Thank you.
This is what I came in the Middle Lab, I did in Lab, I did in a way that I did a video.
They are place to mold.
And one of the interesting things that kind of applied to the people that don't have to give you a lot of instruments.
You just said, "Looks, "Le," and they know what they do down.
That's what other people are trying to do it it.
This is our most young header head, there is the street.
It was just implemented to be implemented.
They only are movies for him.
Now, this is an appliance of a interactive cards.
We wanted to build a tool for the English Lui is Felix.
It can inserve new characters in the scene, to snake the Siftable to their associats.
It can inserve new characters in the scene, to snake the Siftable to their associats.
And that's doing the suntil the sun --
Video: The sole is sources.
David Merrill: Ora has taken a treator in the scene.
Video: The treat. The treat.
Bel work! Sike up.
So I get the Siftable to get the Sifts, can interact the people --
Video: Bu!
-- as inventing their story.
Video: Ca!
DM: It's a story with open-open-opened as a flight as you squares.
DM: It's a story with open-open-opened as a flight as you squares.
Video: Vole,
DM: The last example I have the time to show you is a tool, realized to try and exection to get music and exection to execk and example.
is a tool, realized to recently, to field and execk to execk music.
The Siftable here is based on the sound like the bacteria.
Every one of these has four different variations, and you can choose what you use to use what's us.
You can inserve these sound on this sound in a sequence from the pattern.
And it just just to make it just make a sound "sound a "sound of a sequence."
These are actually that you can control from live -- as the reverse and the film.
And the takes to a particular and then including it to add it.
And then there are general effects like time and volume, which is applied in the sequence.
Let's look like it works.
Video: DM: We're going to put a base in two Siftable Siftl, we system, the system, we put in a series, we add in a series, we add another base.
Now I put a bunch of a bassy.
Video: DM: Oh I add the percent --
Video: DM: And now I'm going to put the movie to the bacteria, so I can control the effect of the live of the live of the live of the live to the real real true.
Video: DM: I can faster the whole sequence that inclining the time from a side of the side of the other.
Video: DM: And now I'm going to add the movie to get the based to the lower to give more expression.
Video: DM: I can get the sequence.
So I didn't want to make it before, but I can try to make it more than to make it more than to make a more crycle.
And now, finally, I can get the whole sequence the whole sequences in the left sleft the Siftable to the Siftable to the Sift."
Thank you.
So as you can see, my passion is build new man-machine is more more more more than the way our brain and body.
And today, I had time to show you one of the results of this perfect of this perfect that we try to bring out of the lab.
The concept I want to transmit is that it's coming this new generation of objects to interact with the media to interact with the media that will bring information in our world that we want.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the hour to talk to all you about all of you.
They're a written scream.
Soref is my profession, but it's more of this obviously.
It's also the love and the fascine of my life.
And I don't know that can change that can change it.
But what, something particular is successful happened in my life and in my career, which has taken me to realibring the entire reports with this work.
And the thing I recently is that I recently wrote this book, this biography called Mangia, Prega, Ama," and I can get a little bit of a reacher for some reason that I got a great reacher in the world and become a big sensational.
And the result is that everywhere from now, people are treating me as if I were convicted to me as if I were condent me as well.
It tru-- condence, convicted -- condence.
They all worry about me and said, "You don't have to be able to well you can't get a better than you can't do better?
You can't keep the writing to keep the life without the life without able to create a book that can be able to make somebody book that can you can matter somebody to get somebody to get somebody who can you get somebody?"
that can be to someone who can you do that?"
It's rassures, you know.
But it could go worst that I could get that I remember 20 years ago, when I started to say to the people -- I was a adolescent -- I wanted to be a writ.
I meet against the same reaction of the country.
And people said, "I don't mean you can't get the success?
You don't have the upon upon the refites of killer?
You don't have to do this mestics to do this mestick up and hories that never came up and die and hories on a heart of skets with the frank-flight cenergy of love flip?
So you know that.
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is, "Si."
I have a little bit of all those things.
I always had the country.
And I also have a lot of other things that people could not have to mean to inner it.
As the algain and other things --
But how I think about this is what I thought I was a very much about the one is that I thought I asked to this?
Is it rational it?
It's logical that everyone who have to wait to be often by a job that you feel that you feel that you feel to do.
But what is so particular in the imprese creative impresection about the mind of the mind of the mind of the mindd?
How do my father, for example, was a engineer and I don't remember a time in his 40 years of the activity where it was asked if he was asked if he was asked to get engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer in his own own own own that was asked to bring?
There was no engineer of the engineer John, how well you wouldn't you have to be -- that wouldn't you have to be John, how wouldn't you have a bad.
It didn't work?
Onestly, the engineers have no certainly in the sectly, in the sect of being alalcolized to be alalcolized to be alalcolized in the rest of the depressures.
We have a written enough this reputation, and not only writers but creative of every generates of all the reputation of being enormously instable.
And it doesn't rest that is to look at the tristes of the magnitude of the magnitude that only in the ventesimsels and often to hand and often to hand often to hand it for them to hand it for them.
And the ones that don't have suicide be actually made by their women.
Norman Mailer, before in the last interview of the interview said, "Ogni book me a little more than a little more extraordinary business of the work of the work of the work of the work of the life.
But we don't have that the creative when we feel that we heard these things that we have these things that are very interiorized and we accept the notion that creativity and the sofft-suffering up in some way and that art and the art of the wood, and it will always be a woods.
And the question I want to ask all the today is that I want to bring with this ideas?
It goes to this thing -- because it also looks like a centimeter of the distance of myself to nothing that supposed to be nothing for anything --
I think it's good.
And I think it's dangerous and I don't want to see the perpetuate in the next century.
I think it's better to incorporate our great creative minds creative to live our great creative creative to live our great creative minds of the creative minds of the greats of creative minds of the creative minds of creative minds of creative mines.
And I know that in my case -- in my home -- it would be very dangerous to begin that heart I heard of the supposed to be able to the circumstances where I have in my career.
Of -- insome, it's quite a nay, I have about 40 years.
I still have about four decade in me.
And it's very likely that any thing that he wrote to be in the world as the work that he was going to be able to be able to the world as I often successful happened in my last libe.
And I'm going to schip, because we are all more or friends here -- is likely to be the most success is to my shares.
Oh, Gesus more, which is that I think about it.
You know this is the genuine of the thinking that bring a person to start to begin to the morning.
I would continue to do this work that we love this works.
So the question becomes do?
And so I seeds after a lot of reflects, which way to keep the way to keep a psychological psychological structure, ok?
I have to find a distance of security between me, which I'm writing to me, and I write, and the natural reaction of what reaction is going to get E, while I was going to look for the year to look through the time, trying to look through the time, trying to look through the time, trying to look through the time, trying to see if I could have ideas and seem to have ideas and seem to see if I could have ideas and seem to be able ideas and sane and the natural written of the way of the way of wrote --
on how helping people creative to the inerents of creative creativity.
And that research was at the Grecia Grecia and Roma.
Seguitems because it was in certain and then back.
In the ancient Grecial and Rome -- people don't seem to believe that creativity came to the man, OK?
It was thinking that creativity was this spirit is about divine and that if you come to a few distant distant, and snail, to reach, to distant, to distant, and sconnected to the distant,
The gregical demoney, the wind of creativity about the creativity of creativity.
Socrate, wonderful of course, it was a demon that elarged by the way that it was wisdom of long.
The Romans were the same idea, but they called that species without the body a genie.
The great is that great because Romans didn't think Romans didn't think a genius was someone particularly intelligent to be smart.
They believed that a genius was this kind of divine that you believe that it was in the walls of a study of a artist, a little bit like elf, and that came out of the art of the East and modeling the job of that I would be the artist of the result of that work.
Extruth -- this is the distance of which is the distance of the psychological psychological that protects you from your work.
And everyone knew that was so that it was so that it working, right?
So the artists were protext to certain things, like for example, or no?
If your work was exceptional was not powerful to take the market, all the market, all they knew that was helped by this genie.
If your work is not all the phally, it wasn't all your broken down, right?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be a incapace.
And so people have conceived the creativity in Occident for a long time.
And then the Rinascient came and all changed this great idea; we put this great idea; we put the human human beings in the universe and mysteries and leave space to creature creatures that writing from the divinity.
This was the main the raational human eximuth, and people started thinking that creativity came to think creativity from isphere.
And for the first time in history, you get that or that artist as a place of the genius as a place with genie.
And I have to tell you, I think it was a big error.
I think that allows somebody to believe a personal person to believe that it is a recipe of being a recipe and the surprising of all my mysteries and hetern him, inconnect and ethern to the fract of the human fragile of human beings to make a film or too big hurt and that human.
It's like to ask someone of the engineer to the sun.
And the form and distores the ego and creates all these ingestible expectations on the performance.
And I think this was to aver the artists in the pasts in the pasts in the past.
And, if this is true, and I think that the question becomes and now?
Can we different different thing?
And I can get a more important understanding of the human relationship between human relationship.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we can't cancell 500 years of rational thinking about a raational talk about a 18 minutes.
And it probably have people in the audience that would be reading legittic with the national nation, you know, you do that they follow the notion that they following the people who following the projects.
And I probably not convinced you all about this thing.
But the question I would like to take is -- why do we -- why is we -- why we do?
Why don't don't think it in this way?
Because it has more sense of every other thing that has ever heard to explain the exathen.
A process that has ever been tent, as anyone that you have ever been taken -- yet you don't understand that is -- you don't understand that is not behavior.
And, in fact, it can seem completely paranormal seems completely paranorm.
I did this meet against the extraordinary poeter-poeter Stone, which has 90 years, but that was a poeter, and he said that during his life and he said that during his childhood in Virginia, working out in the field, and I feel it out in the walk, I was in the countrue.
He said that it was like a fragorom trended.
And that was roten rotating to the landscape.
It was to get to get the land that he did the earth under his feet.
It was to have a solve thing to do that and it was to do that point and he was like, "corrup, "corrupt."
And so it goes to the house and it was insect from this poety; it should be going to do another piece of paper and a mathemates and a mathemates and a late mathemat, and the past, and I read the page.
And the three times you could not be quicked, so correct and the record, and the record, and poeters, and poetry the rotate rockets through the rotate and it would continue to rocketimes and it would continue to rock through the lesson.
And then there were those times -- this piece of the time -- there were no time -- there were no time in the states that was almost lossing the nearly perdent was allowing up the time -- this is not the flight.
So, he was running at home and he was trying to chart and the poety was a mathemat, and he was going to go through a mathem, and then he said, it was a bunch and then he said, it was like if you get the other hand and the off.
And the coffeed poety from the cod-and reputting the pattern and transck the page.
And in these fairly the poety would be on the perfect and intact on the last pard of the first pard to the first pard to the first first word to the first size of the first word to the first side of the word of the perfect word for the last pard and intact page and intact the last word of the perfect word for the last word for the last word to the first side.
So when I feel the thought, it's exactly equal is exactly equal to my process.
I don't have a creative process -- they're not a convict!
I'm a mule, and my way to work out is to work out of the same every day and sources every day and sleeps and go to the sket.
But even in my head, in my text against that I met against that --
And I imagine that many of you have the han fact.
You know, if the work and ideas and ideas and ideas I could not have to know that you could not know that.
And what this is this thing about that?
And how can we relate to that it doesn't make us the head, but it makes us head, you do to rest us sanies?
So I reduced the best example of the contemporary I have a Tom Waits, which I interview in Tom Waits, which I interview a day.
We were talking about this, and you know, Tom, and you know, Tom, for the major of life was the incarnation of the artist of the economic creative to control these species of money creatives you all these species of emptions.
But then instead, and a day was a day as he was driving on the under authrow on the under of Los Angeles, changed all for him.
It was quickly and all of a sent tract this little fragment, which is a melodia, which is a half like the inspiration, elusive and you want to do it and you want to do you know, it's wonderful, and you know, it's wonderful, but you know, it's wonderful, but it doesn't know how to take it.
It doesn't have a piece of paper -- it doesn't have a mathematic, it has no record.
So it began to feel this species of old old old old him, "I'm going to lose and I will remarring up to the person perseeds to be perseed.
I'm not enough enough and I can't do it check."
And instead of going to stop in the panic stop.
And I will put the whole process and found something completely new process.
And he just said, "Scush and he said, "Scusa, not you see that I'm driving that I'm dy?"
"You seems that can write a canger that can write a song?
If you really want to exist, it was a more opportunity when I can take care of you.
Other you important to get someone else to get someone else today.
You go to the Leonard Cohen."
And his process I worked on this one.
Not work, the work was still as a seedge.
But the process, and fishing the genius was that we attempt to release when the genius was that he was nothing else that was nothing else and realizing it from the indeed, and it was going to come up where it was a whole thing that had to be a whole thing that was a whole thing that was a whole thing and back back back and back back and ment.
but it was a conversation between Tom and this is a conversation between Tom and this strana and that hom is not Tom.
So how the story that story to change a little bit of how I was working and already me a time, I was a flight to a time.
This idea, he save, I was writing when I was writing "Mangia, and I wrote in a of those class of the disperation where we were working on something and we can't start something and we could start thinking that it will be a desaster to think that it's going to be a destroyed written written wrote down.
Not only good worst worst well the worst book.
And I started to think about designing this project.
But then I remembers to me that I talked to the air, and try to us.
So I love my face on the handscape and I would say my bements to a nake in the room.
And he said, "You know, I mean, "Yes, what we do do we know if this book doesn't be brilliant not be brilliant not going to be brilliant not the midddy?
Because as I can see that I'm going to put all that he's a little bit of this.
So if you want to be better and you have to give you you a little bit of your parts.
OK. But if you don't know that I don't know that I don't know anything about it.
I will write to write the same because I was my work.
And I would like to favor that I was recorded to me that I today I was in the end of the North -- the end is -- the end of the Africa, the people who were rather for the Africa, the people who were rather for the dances and the sacross the clear and the sacross the wallows to the walbe.
And they were always magnific because the ballers, and they were fantastic.
But every tantly, something happen, something happened, and one of these artist becomes to reality, and one of these artists becomes to transfit it into reality.
And I know what I know about why, you know while you have all the way you have all the time, a performance of it.
It was like the time you stop, and the walked through a species of brings through a kind of carbon and was not doing nothing from the sun, as 1,000 night -- but all of the sun, but everything you get it --
And in the suddenly not just as a human as a human human one.
But it turns out from the begins and underneath of the divinity.
And when this happen, the people knew about it, the people knew what I was, called the name with his name -- they called his name with his name --
They had the hand.S. They started cant, "Ah.Allah D. Oh, God, God.
That's God, you know.
And then they were in the story -- when Moror's invaded the sound of the Spaper, they preserve this habitting with their shot and pronounces of "Ah, Ah," which you can feel in the class of "Oole, you can feel in the corporate of the corner in the class.
In Spath, when a artist has made something impossible and magic -- "Ah, magn, oh, magnific, bad," and income, a scor.
And it's great because we need.
But the problem goes the day down, the ballerine the stame, when you skets are the 11 of the morning, and the last morning, and the last morning.
It's just a mortal with the glands, and maybe you can't get that it will never be able to him to the allow that alteen.
And perhaps none will the name of God even while it is the rest of his life?
It's difficult to be hard to be hard to hard it.
This is one of the most dolorous cycliations.
But perhaps not to be so ancient to be so drive if you can not believe that the most expects of your extraordinary to you, you can see it from you sell.
But it credests to you just that they come up from a inimaginable imaginable to be a fourth of your life that you should spend someone else when you finished.
And, you know, if we think in this way that it all change.
And so I started thinking about it, and it's sure as I thought about different months during the book of the book that public book that public book -- exist period -- fast, exism.
And what I have to keep when I feel when I feel like this is, I don't have paper.
Not only -- not only your work.
He read to presentate you to presentt your parts, any of your parts, any can be well as well as well as well as well to be there.
If your work is ball, ball, ball.
If the divine, assurd to the kind of draws to leave some kind of wonderful time to be able to be able to be able to a moment through your heap, "Ole!"
One of triments, you have the same tumor of your dance.
And "Ole!" to you, you know.
I think we have to teach it to teach it.
"Ole!" to you, even for you, only for hador and text ttext ttext to make you keep keep the way to do you keep keep the way to do you keep keep the text of the tex.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
As you know I've been talking about some of these projects on the human genome on the human genome of the new set of genomes.
We're starting a new lock of the biology, we started to digitalize biology and now to that code the digital code and synthetic code and synthetizing life.
We always tried to bring great questions.
"What's lifa?" is something that many biological biological biological is that a lot of levels.
We tried to different approach, reducing the minimes of the minimes.
We're digitalizing from almost 20 years ago.
When we sequenced the genome was a humans of the biology of the biology of the biology of the computer.
Now we asked us to regenerate the life, or create new life from this universe to this digital?
This is a map of a little organism, the genitalium, the genome of genome genome from the smallest genome between the genome that can self-exploital of the tiny that can self-extent genome of the genome that can self-synthrow organism, which is the genome of the genome of the genome gen
And we tried to reduce the genome to create a little bit more smaller than a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the genome to create a little bit of the genome to create a little bit of a little bit of the genome to create a little bit of the genome to create a little bit more than that.
We're able to eliminate a hundred genes of about 500 that are here.
But when we look at the hundred of his map metabolic map about us.
And this is simple -- this is simple
But when we look at all the genes we can can elimind, a is very imlikely that this can bring to a live.
So we decided to progress to progress in progress to this cromosomes in a way to make the components.
And so we started the wind of the "Posseting a cromother?"
It can make chemistry of prove prove these great molecules that we never can create before?
And, in case of business we can make a cromoso-mak?
A cromosomes is just a piece of material of material in the inerts.
The quickly we are able to degitalize the life is growing up to the exponential exponential that we can deal with the exponential that we can deal with the exponential that we can deal with the exponential to degitalize the life is growing up to the exponential.
Our capacity to write the genetic code of genetic invent -- it's better than that, but it's better than that.
And our most recents results the door of the exponential recent.
We started 15 years ago.
The process has requires a lot of pass the first of the first we started to assummer that we were the first experiments.
But we found that synthetic DNA is very difficult.
There are thousands of thousands of machines that are producing a lot of DNA, of the long ethrow of 30 to 50 to 50 lect and it's a degenerative process of the degenerative and is a degenerative process.
So we had to develop a new metom to assembling these framments and correct the herrors.
And this was our first tent, particular, particular, particularly from the digital genome of the genome of the genome of the genome of the genome of the genome of the genome of the digital genome of the digital genome of the digital genome of the genome of the digital genome of the gen
It's a little viruses that kills killed food.
We designed the framments, effectuated the correction of the errors and eight to a molecules of about 5,000 liters.
The interesting thing is when we took this piece of material of material and we insert it in the bacteria have started reading this genetic code and producing this genetic code and produce to make viral.
The virals are there, you have been release from the cellules, they have been back back and they have the Ecoup.
I talked about recent recent industries of oil industries that they certainly comprehalf of this model.
They have more than you.
We believe that this is a situation where the software can actually build his same hardware in a biological system.
But we wanted to do things in great great things in great things.
We wanted to build the whole whole cromosometimes of bacteria.
They're more than 580 miles of code code code of genetic code.
So we thought of built it in the cassetets of virus, so that we could change the cassetets to understand what's the living components of a living cell phone of the lives.
The design is crucial information is crucial information in a computer, these have to be very accurate to be very accurate.
When we sequence, we set this genome for the first time in 1995 accuratezens was a of a error,
We found out of the original rest centerrors. If we had that sequence. If we had never been able to do that we never have been able to do this working.
A part of the process is to designer several set that you can get the other side of the 50 lects of 50 lects of 50 lects to build underneath tiny to make the small works.
We can reject elements here.
You probably read that we read the physics.
Think about this is that we have a genetic code on four liter: A, C, G, and T.
And so that put them together with about 20 friends together about 20 friammino-half of the setting of the lects.
So we can use the genetic code to write words, fraints, I think,
And what we did at the beginning was autiful to do it.
Some of the fact that was not the poem.
We designed these segments for a terms to simply with the entire hundreds of history.
There are empty that they repeak them and put them up and put them together.
And we started to assembling of the particularly set to seven by five to seven to seven the lects, to make 24 miles adow up to 72 miles to get 72 miles to get 72 miles to 72 miles to get 72 miles ath.
And so we product these segments in the fabundance so that we can sequence, we can actually make a procediment of creating a procediment -- as you see in a minute.
We're trying to automatize the process.
So, this seems the tabellon a tabellon a basket.
When we are going to get these very long-hundred sed, more than 100 mile of the E.
It comes to the limiting tools of the molecular biology.
So we have to be other mechanisms.
We knew about another mechanism called ricombination called ricombination that in biology, which is useful to repeak DNA grade of the universe segments.
Here's an example.
This organism, called Deinococcus radioduring ans, can make three million radiodds.
You can see in the requarter as his cromosometimes come from the destroy of the destroyed.
In 12 hours is four hours is the first of the exactly as it was before.
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do it.
These organisms can set up a whole thing.
They can live under the time.
And I have sure that life exists in space and you get to find new environments to find new environments.
In the real NASA showed that this was a shown that this was a living of the
This is a image of the molecules we built using these process, just using the liview of the design appropriate with the design appropriate design.
The lievised them the auomatically.
This image was not taken with a microscope of electronic microscope of rule.
It's a molecules that we can see the very big we can see with a microscope of the laws.
These are pictures that they cover a period of about six seconds.
This is the audience, we did a little time ago.
They're more than 580,000 letting code code of genetic code of genetic code.
It's a largest molecules of a definitely created by the man.
It has a molecular fish.
If we stamp it with a 10 carefully without 10 pages that would only want to get this genetic code this genetic code this genetic code of this genetic code of this genetic code with a code of a type of the genetic code with a character --
Now, how do we do this work? How can we active it work?
Of course, we tracked a viruses is a girls.
It's a little more complicated when you use the bacteria.
It's simple as a cell of the cell as our cell as our res: you can simply the nucleures and insert a hot of clon.
In the bacteria archaea is integrated integrated in the cell phones in the cell phones that we can do a trapile trapiece of a cell cell of a cell cell of a cell phone and to active it.
We can have a cromosomes from a month, a micro-species species
The two different are different as men as men of the topis.
We add some genes in more way to be able to decide what you can chromost.
And it has the science to the inner in a way to kill all the proteins.
And when we put in the cells in the cell was stuff -- and you get our graphic softor of the new cromosome.
And we thought we didn't think we cannot go to the old, but we tried to be a common on on there.
This is one of the most mechanisms of evolution.
We found that many species have added a second or a second or a third of a few of again a second of a second hundreds of new tratels of this species.
So whatever the evolution as a gene that is only a gene that you don't understand the biology.
There is a lot of the restrial called the restrial of restrial restrial descript DNA.
The cell that it was in the cell that it was not a one of it.
The cell phona-horchromosomes that we inserito--ha.
It's expressive, and it has the other cromosome, as a summer like material material that has masticed, and we recovered with only the new cromother.
It became blue of the genes we have insert.
And in a short of time, all the characteristics of a kind of lost again a new species, and it turned out of the new software that we insert in the cell phone.
All protects, the proteins are changed, members are changed, and when we put the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the equivalent in the protection.
Now, this could seem to look at genetic software and the software we can change the things in the hand.
Now, I have a fairly exploded that there is no parts -- but of progress from three million years and half evolution, and I told that maybe we're going to create a new version of Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosion of this digital process of this digital process of digital process of digital process of the degital with this digital species on this digital species of digital
Why do I do that?
I think it's enough of course, when we think about our necessity.
We're going to spend six billion and a half a billion in the next 40 years.
Rive to give an example: I was born in 1946.
There are three people on the planet for the planet to each existent in 1940, there will be four years, they will be four years,
We're going to find the food, and a fresh water and cleans, medicinal and a half billion and a half a half of people.
It will even more during to do that for us.
We can get more than five billion carbon of carbon of olid.
That means a hort of a day.
When we try to find biological processes or any kind of process of process to replace and it will be a challenge to be a challenge of the enormous.
In the most of the CO2 emission of CO2 from these materials that windows in the atmosphere.
At the day, thank you very much, thank you to the scientific flock of the world, we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I like to think that they are designed for the future.
The electronic industry is only a dozen about a dozen of a components, and think about how many different things are coming out.
Our the limits here are main biological reality and our imagination.
We have a techniques, thank you very much, thesization, able to create what we call genomication, able genomics to create what we call genomics.
We're able to build a big robots that can produce a million chromosomes on a day.
Think of the processing these 20 million genes or to try to get the processing processes to produce the processes or drugs, new vaccines, we can change a little team, and creating biology in the last 20 years of science.
And it's just a standard.
We can choose to choose to survive in survival, prodution or chemistry, prodution or chemistry of vaccines.
This is an instantanea of some software programmed on that we're working for seeing species to set us to set us to save it it a computer.
Well, we don't know necessarily how they will be not.
We know exactly how the genetic code.
We're going to concentrate on the carbon of the generation.
You also have you seen that you can experiment from the grand was a finish.
We have a second of second and generation that will use enough to be pretty much rather than the zuckero-to-fall of the butanol.
But the only way that biology can have a great impact without maybe the coest covers the cost of the food and limiting the coest of the food would be to design the CO2 in material material that we're working for the cells that we are working for the first step, and we think we could have the first carbon of the first carbon of the foot of how we could have the first carbon about 18 months.
The sunlight to combined with CO2 is a metodo--- but in our discovers in the world, we found different metodis.
This is a organism we described in 1996.
It lives in the ocean deep about 2500 feet of the water perature of the water perature of water.
It res hund the CO2 using molecular energy like the sources of energy as a powerful energy of the energy of the energy of the energy of the energy of the energy of the energy of the energy of the energy of the energy of the energy of the energy of the energy of the energy of energy.
We're trying to understand if we can inchanaling CO2, which can be transported tramount of your bur, convert that CO2 in carbon this process.
So that short we think we could be able to increase what the basic question is Now, truth, "What is the lifay." We have the modest of the obillion to replace the entire industry.
And if you can't do that from TED, where you can't do it from TED, where you can do it for us to TED, where you can't do it from TED, where you can't do it from TEDD, where you can't do it from TED, where you can't do it from TED, where you can do it from TED, where you can do it from TED, where you can do it from TED, where you can't do this from TED, where you can't do it it to TED,
It would be a main energy foundation of energy.
And I mean, we're working for the same metodds, to make vaccines to create vaccines.
You have seen this year with the influence, we are always back, and a year and a dollar and a little bit when it's treatment to find the right vaccine and the right right right now.
I think that this can change building vaccinable to change in ancient vaccinable to ant.
That's how the future could start seeing to change it seeming to change it, the tree of evolution, acceling the evolution with synthetic, and infinally infinally indecell and infinally indecell phares.
We're so much to be able to the people.
Our the discovers is to make enough to try to make it a lot of them to make a checks. Thank you very much.
Before I will see the most rapidly as possible, some fundamental work that we took the Microsoft in the followed to a water in the followed water in the middle of Seadragon. This is Seadragon. This is Seadragon.
It's a environment where you can interact is to interact with a huge that remote with a huge amount of visual data in the visual amount of data in the local that you can interact with a huge amount of data that you can interact in the local level that you can interact with a huge amoun
And so we are seeing a lot of gabyte photos of a digital zoom and continue to a quick of a quick of a quick of a fast-hurt images.
And it doesn't matter how big amount of information that we see how big we see how big these data or data or the images.
Most of photographs -- but this for example is a provision of a provision of the Congresss; and reents in the gam.
It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that limits its prestations of a system as this is the number of place in any time. It's also an architecture in any time. It's also an architecture of architecture that is also a very flexible architecture of a very flexel that we can be a very flexel of a system like this is a very flex
This is a book inter, for example of data not images.
This is the Casa desolved Dickens. Ogni colon-holds.
So to show you that it is just just a text of the textremendous and we can make a real.
It could be a little artificial way to read a book for a book electronic book --
It doesn't have a little bit of it.
This is a more realistic. It's a more realistic. It's a number of Guardian.
Every image is the beginning of a section.
And it will actually give you the beautiful experience of read the real read version of a view of a view of a quote or a quote of a quote of a very simple type of meet.
We also did something with the angle of this number of Guardian.
We created a fasulls to high resolution -- much more than that we use in a normal of that you use in a normal audience.
If you want to see the characteristics of this auomobile, you can see here.
Or other models, or even specific specific techniques.
And this really demonstrate some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of the screen.
We hope that this means you can put up up and other hands and other hands and to be necessary.
Of course, the map of the most obvious applies for this kind of technology.
And on this doesn't want to lose time, if we don't have to say that we have contributes to be in this field.
These are all the streets in the U.S. soves in the U.N.
So now we spend something.
This is actually actually from the websk; you can go to the websket.
It's a project called Photosynth, which combine two different technologies.
A is Seadragon and the other is a visual computer that we have a very interesting of the University of University of the University of Washington, with the Hum of the U.K. and Rick Seitz of Microsoft Resear.
And it's from the web, gestraise from Seadragon.
You can see when we do this kind of screen where we can spend from a image of the other image of the experience to the other kind of experience to the last place of the screen of the screen of the screen of the screen of the screen that we can spend this kind of screen to the other screen of the screen of the screen of the screen of the screen of the screen of the scales.
But the space of space is actually a meaning here has actually a meaning.
The Grassimildd-computer view of the computer have recorded these images together, so that they can recorrespond to the imagine, all the near slaghi Grass on the Montags of the Grass -- you're taking a slide-show shared space -- you're going to slide of a slide-show of imagining space of a space of imagine.
I don't know if I have time to show you some other environment.
There are some more space of a more space of the space.
I want to spend directly at one of the nahototoh. And this is a protynthy of Photosynthynth of Photosynthesis to show you what I do do is really the ask of this technology, Photosthynth. And it's not necessarily to look at the environment. And it's not necessary, so much evident in the environment.
We had to worry about legal waste and saw it in the legal way.
This is a rebuilding of the Notare Dame images that Flickr. Basta dr. Basta digitate Dame in Flickr and you get images of types in the machines in the machines of the field of the fields of the fields of a image that is discovers to this model.
So I'm all images if Flickr and have been colleged in space in this way.
And it's possible to get in this simple way.
You know, I would never have thought of the finish to work for Microsoft.
It's very gratifiction to get this kind of accool here.
I think you can see that it's a lot of different kinds of different kinds of photoamer: from those of the photos of the cell phones SLR, a number of myself together in this environment.
And if you can try to get those strange to try to the strange of the strange.
Many of them are block from fact, etc.
And at some of the photographs -- exactly photographs -- except -- etcol.
This is a Notrecords, Notare Day of the records.
We can spend from the places to the view of this environment.
The essential point is that we can do things with the environment. This is taking from all the interal memory of the interal memory of how to apple the point of view -- and collect all those data together.
All those pictures become college, most of the square of the same.
You have a model of the Earth that we emerge.
Think about this as a long time of the Stephen Lawler on Earth
It's something that grows in complexity as people using us. And the vantages to us.
Their pictures are marched by other people.
If someone is the idea of conducting all these many of the name of the name of the Notres of Notres of Notreck of all those data, and I can use all those data, and I can use the point, and I can use the inmers in that collap, in that metail, using the type of the kind of cross-us-user.
Of course, a consequence of this is virtual virtual models of every interesting part of the Earth, and the plane of the land, and images and images -- and images and images -- but from the memory of collective collective collective collective of the collective virtual collective in the planet.
Thank you very much.
CA: I have understand well? What is you about your software is that you will have to be a certain point, in the next years, all the photographs that I shared up in the world will be practical in the world will be practice that you can have this together?
BA: Yes. What is doing.
Shyperlin, if you want to be hyperlink, if you want to be in images.
And it's doing it in base to the content of the images.
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the reck of information that many of these images that many of these images that are possibly interesting images of these images of images that are a lot of these images that are interesting that you can have a lot of these images.
How do you get a research of images on the Web, you digt on the webs on the web pagine has a lot of information about images.
Now, what happens if that picture is a picture of your photy?
So the amount of interconnection of seeds and the amount of recketets that is really huge effect of the retlassical retly.
CA: Blaise, it's really incredible.
BA: Thank you very much.
One of the principal when you travels and one of the research of the research of the research of the research between the traditions, the anti-traditions, the touches in the wind, the touches in the wind of the plog, you can get it in the winds.
Basts to think that sciamans Jaguar is still beyond the Lattea, or the myths of the ancient Inoit is still colmyth, and the Himalaya, the buddi and the himalf the respier of the anthropologia, and that the idea that we live in the idea that we live in the idea that we live in sense that the idea that we live don't have to exist, but it's just a model.
the consequence of a particular choices that our irst, so much generations.
And, of course, we all shares we share the essential tratens.
We all all procreise we all procreight.
We're subjects.
We have to deal the inexorse of morts, so we don't surprised us and ballock and balloons,
We have a art of it.
What we cope is the right of the song, the range, the range, the range of every culture.
It doesn't matter that they are the Enathese, or the Borneo, or the Voodoo of Haiti, or the warrier of the desert in Kenya settries in Kenya settric camels.
He was my own own own on the desert of journey in the desert of the nak in the walls of the Qomolangma, the Everest, the demother.
All these populations teaching us that there are other ways of existing other ways of thinking, other ways of thinking, other modes of move in the world.
And, if you get a flight -- it's a concept that can give you hope.
And so the myrid-cultures of the world create a ragnatela of life and cultural life that we wanted the planet and is important for the planet and it's important for the planet so the planet as the ragnatela as biosphere.
And you can think about this raising cultural as a hetnsnows like a hetness of all the concept of all the concept of all the concept of the conceptions, intuition of human hands in the human flocations.
The fantastic is the fantastic patrimonug.
It's the symble of what we can be as an inquisisitive species of what we can be as inquisist inspired in the symb.
And sure as the biosphere was freezed as it was a flock of the etnsnows and purch, much more quickly.
No biology, for example, it would say 50, it would be about the extinction of all the same way of simply because it's fals, or -- in the most biological iption, in the most biological istry -- and not near to the biological ight -- that is also a popular of the cultural diversity -- that of the cultural diversity of cultural diversity -- that of the biological diversity -- that is the most of the biological diversity of the biological diversity of the biological diversity of all the

Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some of the things I wrote in this book that I hope to recall the other that you heard and proverse to the collegment, in the case of the collection of the collegment.
I want to start with what I call "the official."
The official dog.
The official dog, of the official industrial societies of Western Western offical well-well-being being of our citizen" is to myth the way to be to realize the freedoms to be able to re."
The reason for the ske, in the fact that the freedom is in the same a value, because of human beings for human beings.
Another in the fact that if we are free, each of us can act to do all of us to do all the way to do that we can do all our well.
The way to massimizing the freedom is to matter choice.
My choices people hand, more are freedom, more is freedom, most of them is their healthy well.
This is so proeded to be deeply in society that nobody would have the subject of the hundredred would be doub.
And it's also deeply in our lives.
I'm going to show you some of what the progress of what progress has repossible.
This is my supermarket. It's not particularly large.
I allowed a simple named sounds for insaved.
In my surprising there are 175 conditions, without contains the 10 variets of olive beef and 12 acets and 12 acets that you can buy a number of of conditions, you can buy to make a huge number of of the instead of your own own graded.
That's what the supermarket.
And then you go to the snegotial to buy a sterea, to buy a sterea, casses, CD, radio, plast, practical lific.
And in this single snegotial of electronic components.
We can make six million different combinations of different combinations using the components that there are in a only negotid.
You have to love that there is very much choice.
Other the world of the world of communications.
One time, when I was a child, you could get all the services of the services of desiralies, pt that they were going to be pronititited by mamma Bell.
It was a phone; it doesn't buy the phone;
A consequence of this, in the other, was that the phone is that the phone is not the most.
These times are gone of the time.
Now, we have a variety of phones in the phones -- especially between cells.
Here's the future.
My favorite is in mezo, MP3, MP3, tankay, and the ford for the nase, and the hake is burb.
If you don't have seen in the negotial undernegotial underline below home, you're going to predict out there.
And what happens is that people in the end that people in the negozoos and do this question. And you know what's the answer?
It's not possible to buy a cell that not do too many things.
So, in other life that are much more important than the life that are much more important than the same explosion of choices.
Assistance of healthar: it doesn't happen in the United States that you have to do.
And then you go from doctor, and the doctors, and doctor you say, "Okay, we could do A, you can do A, "A has these wells and these risk." And these risk." And these risks. What do you want to do you to do?"
You say, "Dr, what I should do?"
And the doctor says, "As these wells and these answer and this is this wells and these answer and these risk."
What do you want to do you want to do that?"
And you can get it to me, "Dr. if she was me, what do I do?"
And the doctor, "But I'm not le."
The result called the authonomy of the malato," expression that it seems to look like a beautiful thing.
But in fact, it's not that one is that one to get the fish, and the responsibility of the tability of someone who knows anything that nothing -- and almost of them is not a -- and so we don't have -- and so we don't have -- and so in the ideal conditional decisional to take the patient.
There is a marketing of marketing products, I would say that you can't buy people like me and you, if you think you don't have any sense, you don't have a sense, that we can't buy them.
But if we can't buy them, because there is a public publish?
The answer is that they want to ask we call the doctor to ask the recipe to change the rects.
And so that is so fundamental as our identity is a choice, as you see in this view of the choice, as you see in this view of the baby? They don't want to force. We don't want to make a more identity: There are no more identity: we need to invent.
And we can reinvention us how many times we can get us to get us to reinvent.

And the respect of the family and the mathematrimon, a perspective, I feel that was that you can get the most prest as possible, and he was starting to the most predictable.
The only one one true, and the choice, not here, and nemess what do down.
Ogame is really to play today, it's really to play.
And I think about a very intelligent students and 20, the 20, less of the respect to a time.
And because they don't are brilliant, because they don't are less than the least diligents.
but why I'm impenity, intents asked to ask ask me or no? I should do that I do that? I should do that now, I should do that now,
"I should be a more tardi? I wanted to think about before I do think about the charges?"
They're interrogatives to logorian.
And they try to answer these questions, even if this implements don't completely completely the compites that left you to my exame.
And they have to do it. They're important questions that you have to do this.
Now, the work: we fortunated, as Carl the tineava, because the technology we allows us to work every day, every day, every day, every day, trans that from Hotel Randolph.
And that was a angoline, there's a angoline, and I don't tell anybody where the WiFi works.
Not to say that I want to use it.
What does this incredible liberty of choices that we have to work on the work? Is we have to decide, if we have to work or not.
We can go to see our kid play cell with the cell phones in a tasca, Blackberry in the other, and the ntebook, on the nbooks.
And even though they're all spects, every minutes we see our kid that we can see the game, we also asked this called called this called this called called this called called this to call this called the "I have to answer this called called the "I want to answer to this called called called the game.
"I have to answer this email? I have to abboard?
And when the answer is "now, this makes the experience of your kid or a lot of different than what it would be in other conditions.
So from any part of that we look at this, little little and large and large materials and the life, the life is a question of choices.
And the world was this -- there were some of the possibility, there were some choice. But it was a choice.
The world today is that this is a positive thing is, "Is it is, "Is it is a positive thing.
The answer is Shim.
The slide of the negative -- so I'm going to talk about the negative negative negative to talk about the negative suns.
All this choice behaviors two negative effects on the gent.
The first one, paralycle, paralysizes that are instead of freezed.
And so many options that you can choose it becomes very difficult to do it.
I offer an example meaning a study of the plans of the plans of the volunteer of the volunteers.
A college of my college of the Vancient Vancient of the Vancient of thousand of them with about a million clients of hundreds of clients in 2,000 different companies.
What she found is that for every 10 10 solutions that are going to offert up in the more, the percentage of ades.
With 50 foundation is 10th less than the 10th of the offers, if they are available to only 5. Why?
Because with 50 fours that the foot of the choice, is a hard detail, and choices is remaker to the inquestions.
And at the questions, and the questions, questions, and of course, and of course, it goes up.
You know that it doesn't only mean that this is just that these foods are going to food, because they don't have enough money, you want to say that decision is so ostics that they lost the fundamental dormics of the work.
And not a lot of people who are losing until 50,000 dollars a year from the works, that would be well to be able to verse.
So the paralysis of the have too many choices.
And I think makes the world like this.
"And for the eth, for the ethernity: ketch, sense or mountain?"
You would just take the right decision to take the right decision, if it's for ethnity, right?
You don't want to choose the wrong wrong the wrong condition.
So this is the first effect. The second is that even if we can get the paralysis and make a choice, we less to be able to the result of how we will be with less options that we were going to be with less options that we would be with less to chood.
And this for different reasons.
And one of these is that with a lot of these is that with the choice, if you buy a and it's not perfectly to imagine that you could have a different choice, and that what's going on that would be better than it was better than it would be better imagined in the machines of choice, and the reduces of the choice, and the rest of the choice, and the rest of the decision.
when it was a very good decision.
And the choices that are easy to dispiacering any details of any detail, the choice.
And yet there is what economists call the opportunity.
Dan Gilbert asked a very well stamates as the value that we think about things that we confrontive to the things we confrontive it.
And the options that we have a lot of options to represent them to represent the cartoon the rest of the alternative scart and be less soddds.
Here's an example. I use with all the New York.
But it's what you probably think it probably thinking.
There's this copy of the Hamptons.
A place of us.
It is the splendida. Otyma day. It's all for them.
Nothing about nothing that he thinks is what he thinks is Agostod."
"All my neighbors in Manhattan are vie."
"I could talk about it in front of house in front of home."
And it spent two weeks from the idea that it's perding -- every day -- every day -- every day -- every day -- the possibility of parking where you want.
The cost of diminiscales the sodddden of what we love -- even when the choice.
And more of the options we have to consider the characteristics are going to be as a cost-opportunity.
Here's another example.
This view a lot of things.
It talks about the moment, and perhaps the live of live live to live the time.
But the most important point is that any whatever you choices -- you choices you choices to not do the others.
The things that we don't have a lot of four active that can make less attaching what we do.
Terg-point, you spiral growing of the waiting of the waits.
I tried on my skin, and bought a new jeans.
And I would almost always jeans.
And one time the jeans were a only type them and westive them from bestive and wind them to be able to get them a life and she was taken a lot of flight and well.
So, I went to buy a couple of a new when the old old old old ones were game, and I said, "I need a couple of jeans, this is my cute."
And the broken said, "You want to slim fite?"
He wants to the cernier or with the bottonight? "Stones." "Stone," or ""You're going to list?
"You want to do you do it a rocket?"
"Sotbbroken or stretty? Bla blade." He was -- Continug.
I was a little bit of the balth, and after a little bit of -- I said, "I want the typopo," he didn't have the idea that I was so so so I was going to try to all the same males. I had a little bit of the negotial, then I used the best best jeans that I had ever been able to walk in the best jeans that I had ever been able to walk in.
It was the mas. With that choice.
But I heard I feel worst worst it.
Why? I wrote a book interor to understand it.
The reason I was worst worst is that with the choices that choices were altish altis; jeans had to be perfect perfect for perfect that I was perfect for the states that I was love for the choices were expectations that I was love that I was love
And I had expectations of minimes. I didn't expected anything about existed when you expect only a type of a type of a guy had to be perfect.
What I had water was good -- but not perfectly --
After I was paragoned that choice, I was insodddden to waiting to waiting to waiting to waiting to waiting to waiting to waiting to waite.
The add of options in life that you don't have to increase expectations that these are respectable to the options.
And this will make less soddddisfation, even when the results are good ones.
No one in the world of marketing that makes it contain.
Because if you know what I'm talking about what I'm talking about.
The truth is more about this.
"You was better when it was worst when it was worst worst the reason he was worst when he was worst the worst was that when he was worst even as it was possible to meet of the surprising prepared to fit it in the precise of pretty surprise.
Ogame in the world where we live -- opulents, industrialized citizens with expectation -- the male that we can hope is that things are like to hope is that things are expects.
You don't have ever recently pretty much as you want to be expectations -- the midddle expectations are ingiant ingiant ingiving the waits.
The secret of happiness -- what you're here -- what's here -- "Yes, "Yes, you want to expect."
I mean -- small moment authobiographic moment -- I really feel and my wife is really expendent --
I would not have a measured, I didn't have to be contented.
But you don't always have a good thing.
And finally, a consequence of the buy jeans when there is only that the kind of jeans is that when you're not going to be such a fact, and you ask "Why?"
"Who is responsible to clean answer is clear.
The world is responsible responsible to us?
When there are hundreds of jeans, and you buy a insoddddeface, and you ask you who is responsible to the responsible that responsible to you to get the responsible for you,
You might have a better better better.
And in centines of variety of variety of the insuccess.
So when people take decisions, even if people are taking the outside of the outside of them and they give them their holds and they give them their broad.
In the last years depression is explodepression in the industrialized.
I think a meaningful factor, not the unique -- not the unique of this depression of this depression is that people have experiences because the people have experiences because the standard standard is too alties.
And when they have to explain this situation thinking that the colp, they think the colp,
So the final result is that in general general we are better worst today, but we feel worst us.
Let me tell you that you remind.
This is the official dog, what we all take for good and it's completely falso.
There is no doubt that a little bit of choices that I don't have, but that you don't have a lot better choices that you don't have a little bit better than a popular of a po.
There is a critic, magic val. I don't know what it is.
But I'm sure we have super-sure we have super-hand-level that choices the best choices that choices to our life.
Now, from the political point -- I have almost finished -- from the policy, the crowd is the follow.
What allows you all this choices in the society is the material societies is the material.
There are many places in the world, and you know this is not that they have a choice.
The problem is that they too pocal that they have too pockets.
So the factors that I'm talking about is a diseases to be a diseases of modern, societies.
And what it does deprimate and arrabbbing is this -- Steve Levitt me talked about iers how those costs of the expensive and segolins for bigs to be involved us.
I want to say that these choices, complicated and dispendioss, it's not that they are just inus.
They're delleters.
They do worst worst worst worst it.
If a little bit of what in our society allows you can have a choices that are too points too point, it would not only be their life to be better and now.
This is what economists call a better paretian parets.
A redistribution, it makes all -- not only to poor -- not only in the poor -- because of this choices in this except that it back back to the indeal.

"As a couple of the world."
and I interpretty interpretor -- in the begin.
But then, I think about that, instead, instead, I realized that that fish.
Because the reality of facts is that if you eat the franks, you can't get the freedom, so that you can't get the freedom. You can't get parals.
If you row the mouth of the way that it becomes possible to deminum the soddddden the soddds.
To parals, and you reduce the well.
Everybody needs a sphere.
This is almost certainly too stream, perhaps even for fish, and it was sure for us.
But the suggest of some symbolic symbolic infection for infection, for the road.
Thank you very much.
