Last year I showed these slides to show that the slide that the article calculus to show that the calculus three million years has had the size of the 48 United States of the continental continental continental --
However, this undervalue of the problem because it doesn't show the pace of the problem of the ice.
The artic glacial is is, in a sense, the clear heart of the global climate system.
It expand in the summer and it return it into the summer of the summer of the summer and it return it into the summer of wint.
The next dead is going to be a quick carlled on the last 25 years.
The lost ice lost ice have signed in red red.
As you can see it expand it up to the blue Europe --
That's the ice in the winter that is retreatment.
You can see that the so-called a lost ice of five years or more, is like the blood here is the body, which is like the blood of the body.
In 25 years is what I was like like like this.
This is a problem because the heat care of the very ground around the artc ground the artc ocean where there are huge amount of carbon on congeled that that sheet sheet, they turn into the metane of the microbes.
It respect to the total pollution from global warming from global warming, that amount of doubling that is not returning back.
In some deep lakes in Alaska the metan is already reboiling from the water.
The professoral Katey Walter of the University of Alaska was based on a team that was a very low-down lake lackage in the last invert.
Video: Wow! Al Gore: She is good. The question is if we are also going to be us.
A reason is that this term terms of the Greenland from the north.
This is a glacial river.
The laughter had never reached levels.
This is the Kangerlussuaq, in the southwest of Groenllland,
If you want to know how sale the sea level of the sea ice on the ground of the ground of the ground --
These currents are increasing fast.
By the other side of the planet: Antarctic, the largest block of the planet.
The last month of the scientists have dilarge-launch that the ice is in denious, and that the Western Antarctican on some submarine islands is particularly quickly in the sheep sheep on the sheep sheep down.
Equival to six feet of the water's water, like in Groenlland, like in Groenlland,
On the Himalaya, the third largest block of ice -- you see new laghi, a few years ago were ice to be ice --
40 percent of the world's population received half the drinking water from the monkey to the monkey
Sulle Ande: This ice is the bottom of the water water fount of this city.
The laughter is increasing.
But when it decreass -- the same happens to the pound water.
In California neva-Nevada is 40 percent of the snow is 40 percent
Midries are in crisis.
The previsions, like you have ready, they're grave.
The growing in the world leading to a nurture of the fire of the fighting in the world of the fighting in the world leading to a nurture of the world leading to a nurture of the world with the fires.
The environment disasters are increasing a rhythm and unprecedent --
Four times more numbers in the last 30 years than the previous 75.
This is a whole whole whole bunch of unsustainable.
If you look in the history context if they can see the consequences.
In the last five years we added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 hours of tons in the oceans every day.
And look at the oriently areas of the East East East East Americh, and on both the parts of the subject continent in the ocean Indian is the inner of the oceans.
The most cause of the global warming and the deforestation, which is 20, it's the use of fossil fuel fuel -- it's the use of fossil fuels.
The oil is a problem, and the carbon is even worse.
The United States are one of the two countries with more emissions, with the more emissions, with the more emissions, with more emissions, with more emissions, with more emissions, with more emissions, with the most emissions, with more emissions, with emissions, with more emissions, with the most emission
And it was proposing to build a lot of other central central other
But we're seeing a direction of a direction.
These are the projects that are annulled projects in the last years and some proposal propositions of green alternative version of the last few years and some propositions of the last few years and some proposal proposses.
Every way, there's a lotta political in our country.
The carbon industry and oil industry has spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promoting carbon the last year to promoting carbon on on the last year to promote carbon and the last year to promote carbon and the last year to promoting carbon and the last year to promoting carbon and the last year to pro
And that image I remember somewhere --
Very Natalal in Tennessee, where I live, there's been a loss of 3.8 billion gallallons of carbon dixide digging coal scale of carbon dixide dion carbon didixes of carbon dioxide dion carbon dixide dion carbon dion dial
Maybe you have seen it on the news of news news
This is the second largest flow of excuse in America.
It happened around Natal.
The natalization of one of the carbon industry was this.
Video: Frosty the carbon is a kind of allies and happy.
It's abundant here in America, and it makes our economy.
Frosty the carbon is increasinger and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and cleaner.
It's a good price, adorable and the workers manages are sent to it.
Al Gore: From here is a lot of carbon of West Virginia.
The largest society in the mountains is Massey Coal. This is his friendministrator.
Video: Don Blland -- I'm aware of clear -- Don Blland, Nancy Peloyss, don't know what they're talking about.
Al Gore: So the Alleance for the Clima has launched two campaigns.
This is a bone of it.
Video: ALer: At COALercise we see climate changes like a evy nightning of our business.
So our priority is to invest a big amount of money in a switch to make public and consumption to make public and consummer and truth truth truth to the carbon truth of the carbon truth and make a consumment of money in a very strengaging amount of money in a skiller and
In fact, carbon is not sport.
We think it's clean -- it has a good profume.
So not preocured of climate change.
Let me do us.
Video: Attore: Cololian -- you've heard a lot of it.
So let's do a whole structure that is the kind of a clean carbon structure for the cleaning carbon --
Straordinary! The machines are a little noise, but this is the sound of the clean technology of the clean up.
The carbon is between the main causes of global warming -- but the nievens of the clean that you see it changes everything.
You take a look at this is the hate hate of carbon on technology.
Al Gore: Finally, the positive alternative to economic the economic issues and the national construction and the national security of the national security safe.
Video: Comment: America is in crisis, national economic; national security economics.
The file that links all the -- our dependence on fossil fuel fuel fuel and oil oil oil oil oil matter.
Now, there's a new new solution to uscircles.
Rear America: 100 percent of the clean energy in 10 years.
A plan to reput the America to work on the work, make us sure safer and help stopping global warming.
Finally, a solution that basts to solve our problems.
Never ever of it. Scover the more.
Al Gore: This is the ultimate of the last one.
Gment: Health is to reach America.
One of the fastest ways of finding finding the fuel dependence that they kills our planet.
Comparsa: The future is here. Vento, sole, a new web network of the energy network --
Comparent is 2: Nuovs investments for very well retribites.
Comment: Rear America. It's time to be realistic --
Al Gore: A proverbial African proverbial African said, "If you want to go fast, you go to be.
If you want to go away together."
We need to go away very quickly.
Thank you very much.
Last year at TED I did a introduction on the LHC.
And I promises of switch to update how the machine.
So here I have. And for those that the other time there is no largest scientific experiment, the largest scientific experiment, ever tried -- 27 miles of circuit -- 27 miles of circuit -- 27 miles of circumstance.
Her job is to reach the conditions that were present less than a billion of second from the beginning of the universe -- to 600 million times a second.
That's all this is just the environment.
This is the machine in the Ginevent machine --
We From these min-Big Bang in the relevel of the relevel
This is what I work on. It's called ATLAS -- it's 44 feet and it's about 2,000 feet and a 21-feet diameter of 2,000 feet --
This is an picture of ATLAT in built so you can see the proportions.
We have the 10 secember of the last year we have accepted the machine for the first time.
And this picture was taken by ATLAS.
It was because of a mest-staging room in control.
It's a picture of the first particle of particles that had done all the LHC, entering into collision, deliberately, with a part of the LHC, and spread particles inside the relevel.
In other words, when we saw that the 10 image of the September 10 -- we knew that the machine working, which is a great living.
I don't know if it was going to do more than that, when someone went to Google and saw that the page and the living page, and it was this.
That means we have a cultural impact beyond scientific impact beyond scientific impact on the scientific impact of the scientific impact beyond scientific impact beyond the scientific impact beyond the scientific impact beyond the way of the scientific impact of the scientific impact beyond the way of the scientific impact beyond the scientific impact beyond scientific impact beyond the way of the scientific impact scientific impact scientific impact
About a week later, there was a problem with the machine, had to these movies here -- these sandles.
They take 13,000 prints when the machine is the massive of the powder of power.
Now, the technicians between you look at the movies and say, "It's not true. It's not true. It's too much underlies about.
And they can do it because when they're very fresh becoming the superconducting films.
So, at least 271 degrees degrees to the space that the same way between the stars, these files can bring that current.
In one of the junctures in the LHC, there was a framework in the LHC, there was a fabrication of factory --
So the films are reading lighting, and 13,000 prints suddenly met a electrical resistance.
This was the result.
Now, this is even more impressing if you think these magnets, if you think these magnets, and that have moved about 30 centimeters.
They have been damaged about 50 magnets.
We had to take them to take them to the proud of it, what we did to do with it.
We have repristined them and fighting them and fighting them up.
Now they're now coming back to their place underground
By the end of the end of the LHC is is going to be new inteam.
And we would like it and we expect to get the right data to get to the right data to find out what the way we have the adventure to find out what the universe.
Now, of course, in some way this this is these accidents reaccending the debate of science and engineering frontiering. It's easy to confitting it.
I think that the fact that it's so difficult to go beyond the limitations, I think this is the value of things like LHC.
I would like to conclude with the words of a Inglese, Humphrey Davy, the while, I image, in defense of the experiments of his pupill, his pupill, his pupill, his pupill, he said, "Nis so dangerous for progress of the human mind of the mind of the human mind of the mind of the minds are defining science of defines that science is not mysteries are in nature, which is not new money, that we have a conquent money,
Thank you.
I want to start asking you to get to rethink about how children, toy you play.
And as you can get them to reach them and grab them, take them and they move them, you learn how to think and solve it and solve problems and solve and solve relationships.
The spacecraft is deeply connected to the way we understand the world around us.
So, from the hydrogen of our interaction with physical objects in the physics, with my Pacier and my Jevan Kalanithi, I started asking "And then when I use a computer -- I started asking "And if we use a computer -- instead of having the mouse of the mouse as a digital polympics that is on a digital degree that is to a way to make a information with enter to enter the man,
and we get it to our pleasure pleasure to me?
And the question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer, building the answer, building the answer, building the Siftable.
In a few words, a Siftable is a whole computer as a big interactive computer.
In a few words, a Siftable is a whole computer as a big interactive computer.
You can move them with the hand, they can see them in them, feel their movement and a screen and a screen radio wireless and a wireless wireless radio wireless.
But especially they're physical, like the pipeline morning, you can just move it by afferting.
The Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem for a new ecosystem to manipulate the digital information.
And as they become more physics, you know the movement, and others, as they become more physics, and as they become more physics, and the other, how we move their movement, and others, how we move them to the new and different interaction of interaction of interaction interaction of interaction --
And I'm going to start with some simple examples.
This Siftable is configured to show the video: if I including it into a direction, the video wheeld like this, if you include it from the other hand, in the other side.
These interactive rhyths are aware of others.
If they affect, you care what they do with them.
If they come circums, they can get it and get it to it.
If they come circums, they can get it and get it to it.
They also have their movement and unlining and unlination.
We then realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was the common data, to example of a liquid as if it was a liquid liquid.
In this case, we have three Siftable configured like vernice and I can use them to versing the color in that central that where they mix them.
and I can use them to address the color in the central that where they mix miles.
If we are too too much to the place.
There are also nice possibilities of learning -- like languages, the mathematics and joks where people can try and try and see the results.
Now I'm --
This is a Fibonacting that I do with a equation's program.
Here we have a parle of words that is in the Scarabeer and Boggle.
Orly, at every turns, you get a letter to every Siftable, Pratically, every turns, I got a letter to go on every Siftable, and while it trying to make a dictionary.
And then about 30 seconds remissed and you have a new set of letters and new possibility.
Thank you.
That's what children came to the Media Lab, I did that I had them tried and I turned out a video video and I turned a video video.
They are very much pleasure a lot.
And one of the interesting things about this is that it doesn't have to give you a lot of education is that you don't have to have to a lot of educational things.
You just have to say, "Compyond words and they know exactly what to do.
That's what other people who try it.
This is our younger head over the right.
It really wanted to take a miles.
They were only morning, for him.
Now, this is an interactive cardon it.
We wanted to build a tool, to the learning laughter in the English lam.
It can put new characters in the scene, satisy of the scale of their associated associated with it.
It can put new characters in the scene, satisy of the scale of their associated associated with it.
And that's what you get out of the sun --
Video: The sun is surprising here.
David Merrill: Now it has taken a treatment in the scene.
Video: The arancient treatment.
Bel work!
So if you schooling the Siftable and can make the character can make the characters --
Video: Bau!
-- by inventing the story.
Video: Hell! Ho!
DM: It's a story with the open up and it can decide he like it.
DM: It's a story with the open up and it can decide he like it.
Video: Good light, catching it.
DM: The last example I have time to show you is a tool, realized you recently, to sample and exequals --
it's a tool, realized that recently, to sample and exequals music.
The Siftable here are acting sounds like lower, low-up and bacteria --
Every one of these has four different variations, and you can choose what to use.
You can put these sound sounds in a way that you can get these sound sound in your pleasure.
And then you make it just just by making a sound and a "sequence."
These are actually you can control from living, like the reverse and the movie and the movie
And the attacks to a particular sound and then including it for the same.
And then there are the general way of the time and flourishing the whole sequence.
Let's look at how it works.
Video: DM: We will start putting a basic basic in two Sift-"sequenc," we go to an extend, we add it in the seriously.
Now I put a lower line of the bottom.
DM: DM: Now add of the other than --
Video: DM: And now I'll put the filter to the bacteria, so I can control the liver effect of the live.
DM: I can fit the whole sequence sequence by a late or from one side or or the other.
DM: And I'm going to address the lowest filter to give more expression.
Video: DM: I can recombinate the sequence "flight."
So I don't have to plannish it before, but I can improvise, making longer longer or more course.
And now, finally, I can get the entire sequence with the left left the Siftable le-lead "volumme."
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is building new interfaces more similarity like how our brain workers work and more similarge-like brain and body.
And today, I had time to show you one of the result's results, and some possibilities that we try to bring out of the lab about.
The concept that I want to transition is that it's coming this new generation of designed to interact with digital media with digital media in the way we want.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the time to talk to all of you.
I'm a writer.
And the books is my professional exsion is more than that, obviously.
It's also love and the fall of my life.
And I don't expect to change it.
But, I said that, something particularly happened in my life and my career that I was able to realibrate the entire relationship with this job.
The particular thing is I thought I was written this book, this biography called "Mangia, Prega, and Ama," the qual, different from my previous books -- for some reason it used in the world and got a great conditional, sensely interaction --
And the result is that everywhere are now people treat me as if I was convicted to me as if I did.
It's true -- convicted convicted -- convicted --
They all come to me to concerned and they say, "You don't have fear you can't do better than doing better.
You don't you fear to continue to write the whole life without you can create a book that could matter to somebody?
that could you care somebody?
It's rassicuring, you know.
But it could go worse -- part of that I remember that more than 20 years ago, when I started to say to people -- I was a adolescent -- I wanted to be a writing.
I would go to the same reaction based on the same reaction of the fear.
And people would say, "Don't you have succeed?
You don't fear that the humiliation of the refute to kill?
You don't afford to do this mestior for all of life without that anything is going to die on a heart of a cumulation of loving up with the mouth of loving hold and loved with failing bank bank hold and to loved with failing clawing energy.
So, so you know,
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is "Yes."
And I fear of all those things.
I always had fear.
And I also have a lot of other things that people can't have to guess it.
As the algae and other things that are frightening things.
But, for the writing what I thought and ask me the time is because?
Is it rational?
It's logical that anyone should be pushed by a work that you feel nated to do.
But what is there so particular one in the impreventing us about the health care health care about the healthy health care in a way that other other people don't hell doing?
As my father, for example, he was a chemical engineer and I don't remember one time in his 40 years of activity that was asked if he fear it was asked if he fear to be engineer that?
There was that the block of engineer how do it does?
Would it not work like this, you know, right?
Onestly, chemical engineers like group don't have certainly in the six, and the reputation of being alcolized.
We writers, we have enough this reput, and not only writers but creative about, but creative of all that we have this reputation of being enormously instable,
And it's not another one that look at the sad of the death of the magnificent death of the magnificent death seculture -- just in the 20th century, and often often often their own own young and often often for them.
And even those who don't have seem to be really disded by their women.
Norman Mailer, before I did, in the last interview said, "Of my book killed me a little bit more about it." It's a very extraordinary remarkable to work of their lives.
But not even even about the foot when we hear this is because we have heard these things along that somehow we have completely interiorized and accepted the notion that creativity and suffering are somehow loved and suffering is somehow loved and that art, to the enjoyed and and end, and then will always be on the angotta the bely.
And the question I want to ask all of today is you agree with this idea?
It's good for this thing -- because it looks at a hundred distance to nothing distance at all.
I think it's odious.
And I think it's also dangerous and I don't want to see the perpetuate in the next century.
I think it's better encouraging our great minds to live.
And certainly I know that in my case -- in my situation -- would be very dangerous to start fuel to that I was dark about suppositions, especially the circumstances that I am in my career --
It's just a little bit of a little bit young -- I have about 40 years.
I still have about four decades of work in me.
And it's very likely that anything I write about now then it will be judged by the world as the work that came after the spaving of my last book.
He hadn't slave, because we're all more or less friends here -- is likely to my shoulder.
Oh, Gesus -- that though!
You know this is the kind of thinking that leads a person to start bing gin the morning, and I don't want to do it.
I would keep doing this work that we do.
So, the question becomes it?
And so I always always always on, after a lot of reflection that the way to work on the writing is to create a psychological costructure, right?
I have a few way to find a security distance between me, which I am writing the anxiety of the anxide that written it will get to the other other society to see if they could have better ideas and more healthy and more healthy and more healthy healthy and more health and more blood than the best health and healthier healthier and more healthy healthy healthy and more health and more blood than that.
how to help people create the emotional inerents of creative inerents of creative creative inherents of creative
And that research me led to me to the ancient Greek and ancient Roome.
And then I would say because it goes back to the circle and then back back.
In ancient Greek and ancient Rome -- people didn't seem to believe that creativity came from men, OK?
And it was thought that creativity was this spirit and did, and it came to men somewhere, and unknown and unknown and unknown and unknown and unknown and unknown and unknown and unknown and unknown and unknown
The Greeks called these spirits demoniors of the "demoni" --
And unbelievedly, it believed that you have a demone that would be elgem to heavily el.
The Romans were the same idea, but they called that spirit without a genius of the genius of the genius of the same kind of a genius
And that's great, because Romans didn't think that genius was really a genius really really smart genius was a particular smart of it.
And they believed that a genius was this kind of divine that was living in the murs of study a artist, like the study Dobby, and who came out to hide the work of the article of the artic's job and model the work of the artist and modeling the result of that work --
Ecceptional -- there is the distance of which I talk to -- that construct psychological that protects you from the results of the results of your work.
And they knew that it was so that it was so that it worked, right?
So the ancient artists were protof of things, like the too narcissset, like the too narcisss;
If your work work was exceptional you couldn't get all the degree and all knew that it was helped by this incorporeum of this incorporeum genius of incorporeum doesn't take it all the degree that we could get all the degree that you could get the degree and all of the degree that was helped out of this incorporate was helped by this genius to get the whole thing.
If your work fail, it wasn't all that it was not all of your job -- right?
Everybody knew that it was your genius to be a incapable to be a incapable.
And so people han creativity in the Octudent for a very long time.
And then the Redge came and all the change, and then this great idea, we put the human being to the center of the universe -- all the people and mysteries and unless to leave space creatures that write details describe by devinity.
This was the principle of the humanity and the people began to think that creativity came out of the ish.
And for the first time in history, it started to reference this or that artist like a rather than a person with a genius rather than a person with a genius of the genius.
And I have to say to the way, I think it was a big error.
I think that allows somebody, a simple person to believe being like a recipe like a recipe like the source, the essence and the surprising mysteries and requires is a responsibility responsibility to the fragipsys that human.
It's like to ask someone to ingoid the sun --
It deform and distores completely the ego and create all these ingestiable ingestive expectations of the performance.
And I think it was this pressure to have destroyed artists in the past 500 years.
And if this is true, and I think the question becomes and now?
Can we do it different?
Maybe you go back to a more ancient understanding of the relationship between humans and mystery creative mystery of human relationships
Or maybe no.
Maybe we can't get 500 years of rational thinking in a detaste of thinking about a little bit of minute about 18 minutes.
And probably there's a people in the audience that would have been suspects of scientific suspects on the notion of the notion of the notion of the indicates of their projects.
It's probably not going to convince you all about this thing.
But the question I would like to ask is -- why no?
Why don't I think that in this way?
Because it has more sense of anything that I've ever heard to explain the exasperants of the process of creative process.
And one process that I have been trying to do something -- so basically all here -- yeah, it's not rational behavior rationally.
And in fact, it can sometimes look completely paranormal now.
I did this met recently with the extraordinary poetry in the Ruth of the life and he said that it was a poet-year-old in the rural Virgst of the rural, and he was working out in the stage of the stages of it, and he felt it in it, when a poem came from landscape to the land.
And he said it was like a train of the air.
And that was rolling rotoling to her landscape.
And it was going to get to the land below its feet.
He knew it was a only thing to do to that point and it was words, "running as a morne."
And so it was going to go home and it was insane to this poetpoem, and he wouldn't have to make a piece of paper and a match pretty quickly enough, as the transform, and collecting it on the page.
Sometimes it couldn't be able to be fast and so it correct and the correct of them to get home and the poetry and then he was lost and then he would continued to roll through the landscape, and he would continue to roll through the landscape, and he said, "another poet poet it."
And then there were times -- this is not forget that -- there were no time -- there were moments in which it was almost losing -- right?
So, he was running at home, and he was looking for card and the poem was going through and he was going to be in the way that he was passing, and then he was like to get up with the other hand and the office and the off.
And he was offed the poem of the tail, and it turned it to his body and turned it on the page.
And in these cases, the poem would be presented on the page and intaccount, from the last word to the first word to the first word to the first word to the first one of the first word to the first one of the word to the first word to the first word at the first word to the first pay and intact on the first word of it.
So when I felt think -- it's crazy to my creative process of creative process.
Not all my creative process -- I'm not a conduct!
I'm a mulum, and my way to work is it to wake me at the same time and go and go over and go over and go over and go over and go over and go over and go over and dropping up on the enjoying.
But even I was in my head, in my head, and I stuck against that thing, at the time.
And I imagine that a lot of you have the hang done.
You know, even if the work and the ideas came from a certain source I couldn't honestly know it.
And what is this thing is, is this thing about?
And how can we relate to it in a way that we don't get to lose the head, pluttoast, what would you do to stay it?
And I think the best example of this is the best contemporary example that I is the musician -- I have is the musician several years ago for a newspaper here.
We were talking about this, and you know, Tom, for the majority of life has been the incarnation of the articking, trying to control these species of creative impulses that creative impulses of creative impulses of the totally interior interior --
But then he came up with a day and a day when he was driving on a authoway to Los Angeles, changed all of him.
It was going fast, and all of a whole melodia, which is a little bit of a melodia, which comes into his head like it does the inspiration, elusive, and the wish -- you know, it's wonderful and the wish -- you know, it's wonderful and the wish -- but not as you get it.
It doesn't have a piece of paper -- it doesn't have a recorder, it doesn't have a recorder.
So it starts to hear this kind of old anxide growing in him like, "I'm going to lose and remarrushed by this persement song from this persemble.
I don't have enough and I can't do it."
And instead of going to stopped it.
And he did the whole process and did something completely new.
And he just looked at the sky and said, "You know, don't see I'm driving here?"
"Do you know it can write a song now?
If you really want exist, it goes back to a more opporter when I can take care of you.
Other you want to care to anyone else today.
You go to disturbing Leonard Cohen."
And his process changed after this.
Not the work even even dark it as sound.
But the process, and the fish rush that was released when the genius, the genius that was caused to himself, the genius that it was caused to be releasing it backs that didn't have to be an interior what was an interior and tormented.
but it welevant, wonderful bizarre and a conversation a conversation between Tom and this thing that was not Tom.
So how much the story that I felt how to change a little bit the way I was working and already rescued me to save me a time.
This idea, I was saved when I was writing "Mangia, Prega, Amae and fall in one of those disperation cave that we all when we're working on something and we all when we are working on something and we can start thinking that that the worst book is going to be a dest book that the worst book is never written the worst book --
Not just bad at the worst book written --
And I started thinking about throwing this project.
But then I remember Tom that talked about the air and trigger and try it.
So I got my face in the hands of the tushing and I would say my comments to a room.
And I said, "Well what, you know, both know that if this book is not going to be brilliant is not going to be brilliant, right?
Because as you see I'm putting all that I haven't got to that. I don't have any more than that.
So if you want to get better and get you to get your parts.
Okay, but if I don't do that, you know it, you know, I don't get anything.
I'm going to go and write the same because it's my job.
And I would like to favor that was a record that I had to do my own particip," because -- finally, it's like, "OK, -- centuries in the North Africa people would go to the North Africa and people would go on the soul dances to the very clear dances and music, damong them that would go for hours and hours to the hebel.
And they were always magnificent because the dances were fantastic.
But every lot of it, and it was something happening, and one of these artists became actually transmitting it.
And I know that you know what I talk about, because I know you have seen all a whole thing that is a lost thing.
It was like the time stops and the dancing walks through a kind of portal and was not doing anything different, like 1,000 nights before 1,000 nights before, but everything they hit out.
And suddenly it doesn't just look like a human human being.
But it turns out to divince and deluded in the smoke of divinity.
And when this was the next themselves, the people knew what he was, they called it his name.
They used the hands and start singing, "Allah, Allah, Allah, God Dio, God, God, God, God, God, God."
That's God, you know.
Curious known -- when the More invader of Spain, they had this abitude with their and footprints changed in the century of the "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, that, you can still hear in the corrids or in flamenic.
In Spain, when a artist has made something impossible and magic -- "At the First, I mean, magnificent -- I met a little bit of a God.
And it's great, because we need it.
But, the problem comes on the baller-a-up and the ballers that are 11 in the morning of Martedday and finally last of God is not morning morning,
It's just a mortal with a great dead to the knees -- and maybe it's never going to be able to the alteenag.
And maybe nobody will be the name of God still as it becomes on the rest of his life?
It's difficult.
This is one of the most painful reconciliations to do in a creative life.
But maybe it doesn't have to be so angoeling if you can not believe that, but the most extraordinary thing that I expected the most extraordinary of your being being being being from yourself.
But I just believe that there are data in the prime of a fount of this team of this team of the life that you have to go to somewhere you have.
And you know, if we think this is all change.
And so I started thinking about it, and it is because I thought about it as I thought for several months during the work of the book that was the public -- the dangerous spectacy of my great success.
And what I have to keep telling me when I feel electric I feel electric from this is, not having fear.
Let me just give you your job. It's just your job.
It is to presenting your part, whatever it can be.
If your work is dance.
If the divine, I assurd to you know, I assigned a few kind of wonderful -- to leave some kind of wonderful for a long time through your effort, then "Oh, it!"
Other you do the same dance.
And "Oh, it!" to yourself.
I think I think I should teach it.
"He!" to yourself, even for the samor and testing talks to the human and tests to get you to get to introduce you to get to the stay continuously out.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
As you know I've been talking about some of these projects on the human genome -- what can it meaning and the discovery new gene of genes.
We're now beginning a new percorrect -- we started digitalize biology and now starting from that digital code we're coming into a new phase of biology, designing and synthesizing and life-alizing life.
We always tried to make big questions.
"What is the life?" is something that many biologists I think we have trying to understand various levels.
We tried a different approach, reducing the minims of it.
We're digitalizing by almost 20 years ormas.
When we sequenced the human genome was treated to go from the world from the analog world of the digital world of the computer.
Now we ask ourselves, can we regenerate the life, or create new life from this digital universe from this digital universe to this digital universe
This is the map of a little organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, which is the species from the smallest gender genome between those that can authorities.
And we tried to reduce the genome to create one more more smaller than that.
We are able to eliminate a gene of genes about 500 that are here.
But when we take a check to the metabolic map of the noad-way to the noaddress at the noaddress of the name.
Belililies -- this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate each time, is very unlikely that this can bring a living cell.
So we decided that the only way to progression was synthesize this chromosomes so that we could modify the components to bring some of these fundamental questions to the some of these fundamental questions.
And so we started the adventure of the "Can we synthesize a chromoso?"
Can the chemistry to produce these great molecules that we haven't able able to create before earlier now?
And in case we affected -- can we make a chromosom it?
A chromosome, it's just a piece of chemical material in it.
The speed with which we are able to digitalize life is growing up to exponential rely report.
Our ability to write the genetic code ages, ageum ageing, but it's improving better.
And our latest results the leading to an exponential curve.
We started over 15 years ago.
The process has required a lot of past bioetic review, before we started the first experiments.
But we found that I'm synthesize the DNA is very difficult.
There are tens of thousands of cars in the world that producing little segments, the long century of 30 to 50 letters and a degenerative process -- more than the segment is longer than the segment is longer than there are it.
So we had to develop a new way to assemble these frames and correct the errors.
And this was our first attempt to start with the digital information from Phi X-174.
It's a little virus that kills bacteria.
We designed the fragments, effective the correct of the mistakes and we got a molecules of DNA of about 5,000 letter --
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemical material inert and we put it into bacteria bacteria started reading this genetic code and producing the particles and producing the virals.
The particles have been released by the cell and they have come back and destroyed E.
I talked about recent members of the petrolife's layer said that they certainly understood this model.
They resider than you.
We believe that this is a situation where the software can really build his own hardware in a biological system.
But we wanted to do the biggest things.
We wanted to build the entire chromosome.
It's about 580 thousand letters of genetic code --
So we thought we built it in the cassette of viruses so that we can change the cassette to understand what the components are a living cell.
The design is crucial and if we start with digital information, these have to be very accurate it.
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995, the standard accuratness of a 10 mile mibasis of every 10 mile of every 10 miles --
We have discovered, 30 errorors. If we had that originated sequence that original sequence we never had to be able to do it.
A part of the process is designing down to long bear that are overwhelming with all the other segments of 50 letters to build underunits smaller to build underunits smaller to build underunits smaller that work together.
We try to project one here.
You probably have the bed we put the list we put the righter.
Think of this is we have a genetic code based on four letters -- A, C, G.
Three of those letters together codifice about 20 adminiops, and there's one specific order to bear for every amminoid bear for every amminoid of beating loved for every amminoids.
So we can use the genetic code to write words, phrase, you know,
What we did at the beginning was self-self-self-self-self-self-self-self-around.
Some of them have been dolphushed by the fact that it was not poetry.
We designed these sat these sat at them just unique with a measure.
There are enzymes that repaid them and put them away.
And we started assembling the parts, starting with segments at five letter to seven miletter to seven milletter to a way to create a letter sitting on their time to 72 letter ones, and then to 72 letter --
And we have these check sitting in the abundance so that we are trying to create a very robaby proception -- as you will see in a minute.
We're trying to automatize the process.
So this looks like the tabellon a basis of a basketchet.
When we get these very long-and-a-a-mile segments are not going to grow it in E.
You get to the limits of the modern molecular biology --
So we have some other mechannels.
We knew another mechanism called homology recombination called homology recombination that in biology is useful to repair the DNA to unique the segments.
Here's an example.
This organism, this organism, called Deinodudies radiodurans, it can absorb three million rads of radiation.
You can see in the ground, like his chromosome, it is destroyed.
In 12 -- 24 hours comes assembled exactly how it was before.
There are thousands of organisms that have able to do it.
These organisms can be able to get complex.
They can live under a vacuum.
I'm absolutely sure life existing in space, and it goes to find new rich environments of water water water and find new environments of water.
In the way, NASA showed that this avene.
This is a picture of the molecules that we built using these processes -- just using the lights of the inserious design of the inserious checks.
The lights carry carefully.
This is not been taken with a electric microscope -- but with a regular microscope with a regular microscope.
It's a very big molecules that we can see it with a slightly slightly slightly lighting.
These are pictures that cover a period of about six seconds.
This is the advertising that we did a little bit of a long time ago.
It's over 580,000 letters reading genetic code --
It's the largest molecules of the defining structure of the man.
It's a 300 million.
If we spend it with a 10 paper without space, it would like 142 pages to turn this genetic code to turn this genetic code to transform this genetic code --
Now, how do we make it work? How can we active it?
Of course, by a virus is a game by kids.
It's a little more complicated when you use bacteria as they use bacteria --
It's more simple when it's cells when it's about the cells like our ours -- you can just extract the nucleus and put another one of it, which is basically the process of clonelong, which is basically the process of cloning.
In the bacteria archaea is integrated inside the cell -- but we have recently demonstrated that we are able to do a complete train a chromosome from a cell to another and active to another and active and active it.
We purified a partnership from a microbial species.
The two are different as men from the topis.
We added some gene more in a way that we can decide what to choose for this chromosoon.
And then it hit with the enzymes in a way to kill all the proteins.
And when we put it in the cell was stupending -- and you open our graphy -- and you open our sophisticated degree -- the new chromosom.
And we were thinking we couldn't go to it, but we could have provided it to push it more than that.
This is one of the major mechanisms of evolution.
We found that a lot of species have added a second or a third one third one of them -- added in a second thousands of new tracks to that species.
So who think about evolution like a only gene when it was not a lot of the biology doesn't understand much of biology.
There are enzyme enzyme enzyme enzyme enzyme enzyme --
The chromosomes that it was in the cell of it.
The cell ph-the cell cell that we have inserito-do-taste ha.
And it turns out, and it recognized the other chromosome, the other way as a from, and we got found with just the cell and the new sromoot and the new chromoon.
It became blue because of the genes we have inserved.
And in a short time time all the characteristics of a species have been lost lost and transformed all in a new species, based on the new software that we put in the cell phone.
All the protein has changed, members have changed, and when we read the genetic code is just the equivalent to what we have transfer to what we have transfitted you.
Now, this may seem to genetic alchemia but altering DNA software we can change things in a pretty much replace.
Now, I explained that there is not about genes -- but progress from three million years and a half million years and a half million years and a half of evolution, and I said maybe we're going to create a new version of Cambrian explosion of this digital process.
Why do I do that?
I think it's obvious when we think about our needs.
We're going to spend six and a half billion people to nine billion people in the next 40 years.
Just to give an example: I was born in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for each one existing in 1946; 40 years will be four years will be four years will be four years old, there are three people on the planet for each other.
We're having problems now to find food, fresh and clean-up and drinking and doubt for six and a half billion people.
It's going to be even harder to do it for nine billion.
We use more than five billion carbon dion, more than 30 billion barrels of olium barrel.
That means a million barrels a day.
When we try to find biological processes or whatever the process of replacing processes -- it's a huge challenge of it.
We need to hold all the CO2 emission of these materials that fins up in the atmosphere.
At the day of today, because of the scientific discoveries around the world, we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I like to think that are the design components for the future.
The electric industry has only a dozen dozen about how many different things have come out there.
Our limits here are the biological data is the biological reality and our imagination.
We have the techniques that because of these sympts, so that we can create what we call a combinative genomic genomic genomic is a combinative proprices --
We are able to build a big robot that can produce a million chromosomes a day.
Think of process, these 20 million genes of different genes or to try to optimize the processes to produce either either and a little team, we can change it, we can change it, through a little team, and create more biology than now in the last 20 years of science.
And it's just a standard selection section section section.
We can choose for chance of surviving, chemical or carbon dioxide ethc.
This is an instant instanea few software programs that we're working to be able to sit and design species to the computer.
Well, we don't necessarily know how they will be year.
We know exactly how their genetic code --
We're now focusing on carbon on on carbon on on carbon on on carbons.
You see you that you have to extract ethanol is a male experiment.
We have carbon on depending on the third generation that will come up enough sugar as as the either of the highest carbon like the either or different kinds of throwing out of throwing --
But the only way biology that biology can have a great impact without increasing increasing the cost of food and limiting the delibility would be transforming the CO2 cells that we are working to design cells that can reach this purpose, and we are able to be able to get this purpose and we can get this pursue, and we can get this pursue of about 18 months.
The sunlight combined with the CO2 is a methododo -- but in our discoveries around the world, we found different methods.
This is an organism that we described in 1996.
It lives in the deep ocean to about 2,500 feet of deep water.
It creates metane from CO2 using hydrogen molecular as a source of energy.
We're trying to understand if we can put the CO2 CO2 -- which can easily be transportated with tubes, converting that CO2 in order to drive this process.
So short we think we could be able to increase what the question of basic question that the basic question that the basic question is Noi, replacing -- we have the modest of replacing the entire industry.
Exactly. If you can't do it from TED, where can you do that?
It would be a main fundamental source of energy --
And the other thing we are working for using the same methods to create instantaneous instantaneous vaccines
You saw this year with the flu flu and we are always back, and a dollar in less when it's the way to find the right vaccine vaccine vaccine vaccine to the right vaccine right.
I think that what you can change in a anticipent vaccines in anticippy.
That's how the future could start changing as a change, now, the tree of evolution, accelerating evolution with synthetic bacteria -- and then finally hell and then then the eucariot's tree of evolution,
We are so so much from the people to improve people.
Our purpose is to do it in a way of living enough to try to get to celand. Thank you very much.
First of all I'm going to see the most rapidly possible, some fundamental job of the new technology that we have taken to a year aquididention to a year aquatives --
It's a local that you can interact is a local level that remote with a huge amount of visual data here.
Here we're seeing a lot of gigabyte from a kind of digital zoom and continue, for a very quickly scpanoramic pictures like we want.
And it doesn't matter how much the amount of information that we see, how big these data is the amount of data or images.
Most of them are digital photographs, but this is a scannotion from the Biox-the-and-re-mega-a-and-a-megapixed in the legal of the 300 megapix.
It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that the prestations of a system like this is the number of pixels on your screen in any time. It's also a very flexible architecture --
This is a whole book inter, example of data doesn't imagines.
This is Dickens. Every colonna represents a capitulate --
To show you that it's just about heading and not imagines, we can do something like this, to see really it is a real representation of the head, not a photoo.
It could be a little artificial way to read an electron book.
You don't advise the advice.
This is a more realistic example of the Guardian number of the Guardian exact number of the Guardian example of the Guardian example of the Guardian.
Every picture is the very beginning of a selection.
And it really gives you the pleasure of the experience of reading the heart version of a magazine version of a fiffth of a magazine or a news kind of better.
We also have something with the corner of this particular number of the Car Guardian
We created a high-resolution advertising -- much more higher than what you use in a normal commercial advertising -- and we put you in the content content content content content content content content content content -- much more than what you use in a normal content content -- much more than what you use in a normal resolutions.
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile, you can see it.
Or other models, or even specific specific that we can do it.
And this really demonstrates some of these ideas to get the limits space on the screen.
And we hope this lady to put the pop-up to other pop-up and websites are not to be necessarily necessarily to be necessary.
Of course, the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology.
And I don't want to lose time, if I don't say we have contributed to the field.
This is all the streets in the U.S. sovation over a geospatial image of NASA.
So now we go to something else.
This is now now in the webs; you can go to the webs; you can see it.
It's a project called Photosynth, which fighting two different technologies.
A is Seadragon and the other is a very research visual computer to do very interesting computer that is a very interesting student of Washington, with the aid of Washington, with Steve Seitz UW, and by Research Szski of Microsoft Research of partnership. A lot of collaboration.
And it's from the living on the web, and I managed by Seadragon.
You can see it when we do this kind of screen that we can go from one picture of the other and have this kind of experience to the other kind of resolution in multiple resolution in it.
But the spacecraft collection of the images here has actually meaning.
The visualization of the computer visualization has registered these images together, so that they corresponding to the real places that you can imagine that the real places that you can imagine that you can see in the Halygen on Montages -- have been taken on Montages -- have been claimed with a slide-she's de-show show stabies of a bread of space.
I don't know if I have time to show you some other environment.
There are a lot more spacecraft of it.
I want to spend one of the original set set of the original data sets of Noahahsmart -- and this is from a previous Photosynth of the first summer -- to show you what I think is really the key to show you what I think is really the chief, Photosynthosynthight in the website -- and it's not necessarily so much evident at the environment we put in the websitting of the environment of the We.
We had to worry about the legal aspects and so forth.
This is a reconstruction of Notre Dame images preventing Flickr. Basta digital make, Notre Dame in Flickr in Flickr and you get images of the campink and other of the camppyne, and you get these around, the around, it looks like this model.
So they're all taken from Flickr and have been related to this way of this way.
And it's possible to navigate this simple.
You know, I would never have thought I enish to work for Microsoft.
It's very gratificing this kind of account here.
I think you can see that it's a lot of different types of frames from those of the cell phones to those of the professional SLR, a a significant number of these are in this environment.
And if you can try to try and those more strange.
Most are blocking, etc.
Something here is a series of photographs -- there it is.
This is a Notre Dame recorded right right record.
We can go from the physics of this environmental view of this environmental environment.
The essential point is that we can do things with the social environmental environment. This is now now taking data data from everyday collective -- from the interviewing memory of visual -- and all those data together.
All those photos become linked together, more than the sum of the parts.
You have a model of the land of the entire emerge.
Think about this as a prolunger of Stephen Lawler on the Earth virtual Tupon the Earth virtual virtual Earth virtual virtual Turging to this as a prolunger of the work of Stephen Lawler on the virtual Earth virtual virtual
It's something that growing in complexity as people are using, and the advantages that are useful for who uses the use.
Their pictures are brushed with metads from other people.
If someone comes the idea of the idea of delivering all these sants say my photographs of Caaatheless, it is a sudden of all those data, and I can use it as a ingressspots to immergery to that space, in that space, in that space, and having a social experience of the type of red typ-mode cross-motion and cross-mode from the type of the type of the type of the data,
Of course, a consequence of all this is virtual modeling of all the interesting processed of all the interesting part of the earth of the earth and satellite images and satellite images and satellite images and satellite images and satellow images from collective memory.
Mille thank you.
Chris Anderson: Do I understand good? What your software will give us to do is that at a point, in the next years, all the photographs of the next years, all the photographs of the world will be almost connected?
BAA: Yeah. What is doing is actually discovered.
It's creating hyperlink to the hyperlink in the images.
And it's doing it in the content of the images.
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the wealth of the seeds of the very most of these images are possible.
As a research of images on the web, you know, a phrase and the text on the Web page on the Web ph pictures of the photos.
Now, what happens if that picture is connecting to all your picture?
So the amount of seed interconnection and the amount of rich interconnection is really enormous about it is a very large effect of the network.
CA: Blaise, it's really incredible.
BAA: Thank you very much.
One of the pleasure of the pleasure when you travel and one of the etnographic research is the way that we can live in who has not forgotten the antic of the preventing in the wind, tough stone in the wind, it in the leaves of plants.
You think that the monkey Jaguar travel even beyond the Milky Way, or that the myths of the old Inuit is still a meaning -- or that in Himalaya, the budge of the Dharm of the GDhar, to remember the central importance of the ancient ance, and that the idea that the world in which we are not existed in absolute, but it's just a model of reality, but it's just a model of the world in which we live and make sense of reality,
the consequence of a particular adaptive choices that our stirps our stype made -- a lot of generations ago.
And of course, we all share the essential tracts of essential trates.
We all hidden it.
We are subjects to start with the initiation.
We have to deal with the death of death -- so we don't surprising if we go and balance --
We all have an art.
What it hits is the depending of the canzone, the rhythm of every culture.
Not matter that are the Penan forests of Borneo, or the follows of the Haiti, or the warriors of the desert Kaisut in Kaisut in Sepentrional Curander or camellow in the heart of the Sahara.
He was my journey company in the desert a month ago, or a month ago, or a yak in the Qolang, on Everest, the mother of the world.
All of these populations teaching us there are other ways of thinking about existing ways of thinking about, other ways of thinking about the world.
And if you reflect, it's a concept that it can give you hope.
Inside, the culture miriades of the world creating a spiritual and cultural life that goes on the planet and cultural that is important for the wealth as the planet as the wealth as a biosphize, as a biosphera.
And you can think about this raise as a ethnosfer and you can define the ethnosfail the sum of all the conceives, ideas, ideas, ideas, inspirations, ideas, inspirations, ideas, inspirations, intuitions belong to be from the height of consciousness from the alba of consciousness from the treatment.
The ethnosfail of the human patriage of humanity.
It's the symbol of what we are and what we can be in how much specifically inquisitive.
And because biosphere biosphere was very much as it has been so much as the ethnosfaulty and unfortunately, too much faster than that.
No biologist, for example, the degree is about the east is on the east of the extinction -- because it's just fail, in the most apocalittic -- in the field of biological diversity -- and you don't get to the more optimistic -- that the cultural diversity of the cultural diversity -- that of cultural diversity -- that the culture of cultural diversity.
The indicates all of this is, of course, the loss of all of this is the loss of this is a loss of all that is, of course, the loss of this is the loss of the language.
When you're born 6,000 languages on this planet.
A language is not only composal from a vocabulary or from a series of gramatical gramatical grammatical --
A language is the sprap of the human spirit is the price of the human spirit is the price of the human spirit is the sprap of the human spirit.
It's the middle of which the animation of every culture is in the material world.
Every language is a forest of the mind, a soul ecosystem thinking, a ecosystem possibility of spiritual possibilities.
And of those 6,000 languages, as we sit at Monterey, at least half it is not more ssurrying in the ears of children.
They don't get more teachers to the children, which means less you get to not, less you get something that is already dead.
What is there more sad of the silence of being the silence of the last talk to a language of having a language of having a way of address or anticipate the promise of the children?
This is the time of someone in the world of a few weeks of the world every two weeks a old and brings up with the last few weeks and brings a language --
And I know someone to say, "Is it not the better than that?
The world would not be a better place if we were all the same language?" Benissue, then we talk all yoruba. We all yoruba. We have a better place if we were yoruba.
Let's talk about kogis.
You will see a tract thing that means you can't talk about their language.
I would love to give you a journey through the ethnosferap --
a little journey in the ethnosphery to give you a above what we're lost here.
Many of us forget that when I say, "different ways of existing -- I mean really different ways of there are really different ways of them.
So let's take this little baby Barasana, in Amazony, the popular of anacony, which creates the anacony, which creates to provide lay out of sacries of snaker in same.
It's a population that is not able to distinguishing the blue color because the celests is identified in the forest, which depends the popular time of the forest, which depends the popular people
They have a strange language and a marriage rule, called "exogamicistic language -- you have to marriage a different person talking about a different language.
And all that has roots in the mitological past is that in these extremely extent family in which they talk about six or seven lings, no one of the unless of a language of practices no no language.
They just just listening to and then talk about.
We take one of the most interesting tribes with the I liver liver and the Waorani of Ecuador nords, an incredible popular that had the first contacts in 1958.
In 1957 five mission have attempt to committed a factor of a facal mistakes in the 1957 mission error.
They made it from the photographs that they would reach them in a few that thought thought they were love, dimentiling that this population of the rainforest, had never seen anything than two-dimensional dimensional dimensional of the size of the size of the size of the size of the pluvial forest.
They picked up the pictures from the ground to a form or a shape or a shape or a figure -- they hasn't halculated that it was the diavold, and they killed the five mission with the lances.
But the Waorans didn't kill only the foreign foreign just the foreign of the foreign --
They kill themselves.
54 percent of the death was caused by their own themselves.
We are eight generations and we found two natural death cases and we found two natural death cases and when we put it in a saying, and they have been so aging that they died it, and then they killed it itself and then they killed it itself.
The hunters were able to recognize the animals from 40 steps and recognize the species.
In the early 1980s, I was an really interesting job when my professor of Harvard asked me if I wanted to go to Haiti to intrue that I wanted to go to Haiti to intrue society that Duver and MTonton Macoutes, and impossessed to the veleness of the velended up with the velended up with the veleness of velened to do the vessels of the velening of the vessels of the vessing to do of the velening of the
To make sense of the miracle I would have to understand the Voodoo culture and that Voodoo is not black is black hole.
It's rather a lot of a metaphor or or or of the world.
Very interesting.
If I ask you to tell you the great religions of the world, what would I say would you say about it?
Christianity, Islam, Buddismo, Ebraism, etc.
A continent is always leaving out, thinking that sub-Saharan Africa has no religious ffaid -- and instead of the distilled of these very profound religious conceived of these very profound religious conceived in the tragic tragic javism of the back.
What makes voodor is the intriguing is the intent relationship between life and dead.
So you get the spirits.
Eventures can be invocated by the Grande Aqua, they respond to the rhythm of the dance and they replace themselves, they replace that for a short active way that for a short active deal.
So the voodoodooists like "You want to white speak to God.
We give us in the theme and become God."
And from the moment you can get a little spirit that you drive to you, how can you do mal?
So you look at these incredible events -- following voodor in the state of trancing tips that touch emboards that touch you get into a rather demonstration of the power of the mind on the body when they catalized in a state of summer of extreme extremely quote.
And over all the populations that I lived the most extraordinary Kogi of Santa Marck's Santa Marckrow's in the Colombia Santa Santa Santa is the Kogi of the most extraordinary of the Kogi of the Santa is the Kogi of the people that I've lived the most extraordinary of the people that I lived the most extraordinary in the most extraordinary of the people that I lived the most extraordinary of the Kogi is Kogi is the Kuride of the most extraordinary of the most extraordinary of the
It turns out that it was the one time that they were living on the career that once they lived on the career of the Colombia in the attempt that they were living on the carbolic mass that it was on the carbolds' plans on career floor on the carbold:
In a macchieved continged with the shelter never been conquered by the shagnocing from the shagnole of the spaging continent.
And yet is a government in the classroom but their training is quite extraordinary.
The young following are being brought by three or four years and live in a secregated world of good and hombers in a world that they are three years old, and hombers to the base of the ice for 18 years.
Two period of nine years of proposited to reproduce the nine months of management that spend in the user of the mother, are metaphors in the uterads.
For this time, they get accultured to the values of their society, values that they have their prayers and only their prayers and only their prayer -- or to say the conmise -- or to say the ecologic balance.
At the end of this amazing initiation, it turns out and it turns out the first time in life, they are in my life -- at the age of 18 years old, they see a stake up the shelter of the first bags -- when the sun sun is all that they learned in theory -- all that they learned in theory comes conference on the sun and says, "I'll talk about the past of the past --
"Do you know, I just detail.
It's stupend. It's about you protect."
They call us the largest brothers and say we are the honey brothers of the world.
This level of intuition is extremely important.
When we think of indigenous people and in the environment and the environmental environment and the old story of the wild noble nowl history of the wild notion in his simplicity or maybe we invote Thorage and say these people are closer to the Earth of us.
The indigenous people are not not feeling or or unfortunes from our algic manages from our algic by our algies.
There is no space for these things in malaric palude in the gelippylies of Tibet, but because of time and reports, they created a mystical of Earth doesn't have to the idea that they don't know that they are consciously aware intuitive to the Earth -- the concept that the Earth can live because it is infuse by consciousness -- the concept that the Earth can live because it's not aboutside human consciousness
What does it mean?
It means that a child from the Ande that grows to create that the mountain is a spirit that is a spirit Apu that will lead to be a deeply deeply and will have a very different relationship with the mountain or that place to a mountain or that place to a mountain in Montana growing that ground is a mass of rock to be ununununround being being swed.
which is the dimoral of a spirit or a little bit of a mineral is irrizing.
What is interesting is the metaphor that define the relationship between the individual world.
I grew up in the forests of the Britann's rainforests had been cut.
And that it has resilized me from my friends who believe that the forests are creating that the forests are death the Huk's dimora paradic and the beat the beat the beat the world, the beat north of the world, spirits that are living to the world, the spirits that are facing in the Hamatsa.
If you start to consider that these culture can create different reality, you can start to understand some sense. You can start to understand some sense.
I took this picture to aprile in the nornornordocker Amazony.
Maybe some of you heard about the ayahuas's ayahuas, the most powerful repertoial repertoxic repertower than repertoo.
What makes a fascinating ayahuas's not the potential for the support of support, but its processing processing. It's made by two elements.
From a lian lian lian lian un-carboline, harmine and harmine and harmine molecules, harminous hallucinogene.
And I take the only plant one of the bunch that you can have a smoking out of consciousness -- but it's chosen with the leaves of a coffee family arbuster of the coffee.
This planta is powerful powerful powerful powerful powerful with serotonin, methoxypt-5-methoxypt-5-methoxyptine dethoxyptine dethoxyptine deths --
If you ever see the Yanomami tiring on the nose of the substance that make from a different set of species, I would ancheck a methoxydimeltryptamine.
Tiring that polish is a little bit like being disappeared by a fire of the slopink and land on a sea sea of electricity. It makes a degree of electricity. It makes the dissolution of reality.
I was often often with my professor, Richard Evan Shultes, the man who cut the man was psychchopen, with his discovery, with his discoveries of the hallucinogens in the 1930 in Mexico.
Second my thesis not able to classifix these triamines like hallucinogens because if you're made not to tell anyone to be hallucinated because. And they can't be hurranging because they're dened saturated to be because they're dened saturated by a matter that it is naturally in the inter of the intrigued monoxidayses.
You can just be able to be just if you put it on other chemicals that dens denaturn the MAO.
Now it's the beauty between that are initial better? The same kind of inbats that are initibating, the same kind of a potentiate triptamines spontane: in a flour 80,000 species of plants, how these people are doing these people are in the plant, how these people are going to find in this way, is a biochemical version of the part?
We use the great euphemism of proof and error, which can reveal infrutting.
But if we ask Indians, they will tell us "Waking us to talk about that."
What does it mean?
This tribe, Cofan, has 17 variety of ayahuas's ayahuas's eye in the forest, and that they would go into the same species.
If you ask him how they stabilize their pocckleep, they will tell us how much the rest of it doesn't know all y?" I said, "No."
The solution is this: You take 17 variety in a night of the rain and each one will channels with a different different tone.
And so you don't have a Harvard, but it's much more interesting to count the stams.
Now, [[applausi] the problem is that even the ones that have to heart the people who have to take them in the brand painting them in the margen history of our real world, and it is to the brand past to the margerial world, and it to bear the brand the three.
In fact, the XX-century, 300 years old, it will not reminded for his wars or innovation of technologies that but rather like the age that we stopped and actively and accepted actively and the destruction of the planet. Now the problem is not change.
All cultures through the centuries have been involved in a dance for new possibilities of life.
And the problem is not technology.
Indians have no stopped being Sioux when they put on the ark and fresh as the Americans have been fresh to be Americans when they put them on the horse and calculus
It's not the change or technology that threat the ethnosfer. It's the power.
The domination flightning of the domination.
And if you give a look at the world, you will find that these are not destined cultures are not destined to disappear.
They are living and dynamics and expanded out of the existence from existence existing that are beyond their ability to adaptation to adaptation --
I think it's disbodic in the patries of Penan's --
a no-made Sarawak, in the Sarasian population of the Sarasi-to-a population ago, and now reduced to a generation ago, and now reduced to the rivers of the rivers of the rivers of the rivers that looks like to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to brought the middle of the Meridional, where navi naves lighting the the gymption,
It ready to reach the saming slope to the forest.
Or in the case of Yanomami, are the diseases that have come to the discovery of the golden of the golden ord.
If we move on on the Tibet, where I'm doing a lot of research, you'll see the during the last flight of political domination.
As you can know the genocide the genocide of a popular popular level, but the ethnogigiven the destruction of the lifestyle, not only is not just convicted -- but even celebrated in certain environments, but celebrated in the environmental environments, because it makes a part of the strategy of development.
And you can't understand the suffering of the Tibet until you get from the beginning.
I have the 6,000 miles from China in the West in China in China in the West through Tibet Tibet with a young link, but only came to Lhasn't the statistics that we hear about it.
6,000 monuments sacred in the polite and cenergy.
1.2 million people killed by the military in the Cultural Revolution --
The father of this guy was listened to Panchen Lama.
And that means that it was killed at the time of Chinese invasion of Chinese invasion of the Chinese invasion that was killed at the time.
The one is fighting with Santity during the diaspora that has brought the population in Nepal.
Her mother was imprisoned and his mother was being rich and real.
It was brought to the age of two years from the age of two years from the age of the gonna because it could not live without him.
The sister that has done the same, was in the reedual reedure.
One day he had wisdom in a best. And then the day -- this transgress was put to the foreign with the forced workers for seven years.
Tibet can be inable, but the spirit the reef, but the spirit of the population is from keep.
At the end, all it reduces to a choice.
We want to live in the world of the monoony world or we want to accomplish the policy world of different policy?
The great antropologist Margaret Mead, before we die said that his oldest fear that in our way to this world, not only we're going to see the whole legal legal of the world, not only we're going to see the entire legal report, but a day we go from a sleep, but a day we see it from a dimentor that there were other possibilities.
And it's humiliating to remember that our species is existed for 600,000 years.
The Neolitical revolution that gave us agriculture, which has made us to be able to devise the cult of the seed-grade culture with the classroom proof the classroom with the proof the specialization of the specialization, and we talk about 10,000 years ago.
The modern industrialized world has to be 300 years.
That sweet is not suggests that we have the answers to all the challenge that we have to deal with in the millennian to come to the millennian to come to the millennian to the millennian to the challenge of all the challenge that we have to deal with the detects that we have to deal with with the reverse of me that we have to deal with the answers that we have to deal with the answers to to to the deal with the deal with the answers to to to to to to to to to the answers that we go to
When the culture of the world cultures are asked what to say, to be humans, they respond to to be human, they respond to 10,000 different voices.
And it's in these answers that we all rerisk the possibility of being what we are.
I took this picture of the north of the island of Baffin, when I went to hunt whale with the Inuit, and this man, Olayer and this man, Olayered me history of his grandfather.
The government government was not always gentile with the Inuit and in the 1950s to stabilize our souncy, we have reinhinded them in colonies.
The grandfather of this man refected to go out.
The family of life, he took all the arms, and all of his carms, and all its attaches.
You have to know that the Inuit doesn't temme the fresh -- the exploite.
The slits of the slits were made of the fish skin in caribs.
The grandfather of this man did not put intimit from the artic night or the basis that was suffering in the middle of the layers.
It's sunched, and it was hoted the pantalones in their hand. And when I did the paper -- when I did the paper -- and when I made them create a lam.
It has praied on the dot of this key and when they came solid and when they came solid -- he killed a dog.
He schooled the dog and created a brilliant with the slittle, with the slittle, and it has put another dog on the bankkkleek in the banking, and the caccept in the bag.
We want to talk about horse? [Risat] And that, in different ways, [Applausi] is the symbol of the resilience of the Inuit and all the indigenous population of the world.
In the 19aprile 1999 government canadedicated to Inuit the total control of an area of an area of land land land in the California and Texas put together.
It's their new pathy. It's called Navut. It's called Navut.
It's a independent third. They shall the minerary.
One splendido example of how a nation-state can reconcilit with his popular its population.
And finally, I think it's quite obvious about who we have been in these remote areas of the planet, I realized that not is remote to the real act.
For someone is home.
They represents the human imagination that are risk to the tree of the themselves. And for us all of these children, like the dreams of our children, becoming part of our children, becoming part of the hope of the hope of the hope of the hope of the hope of the hope is.
Finally, we have National Geographic we have convinced that politicians will never come to nothing.
We believe that polemicy --
[Applausi] not persuasive, but we believe that stories can change the world, and maybe we are the best institutioning to tell the stories of the world.
156 countries transmitted our television channel.
Our magazes are reading from millions.
Our work is traveling in ethnospher's performance to bring our public and cultural reaches from which they have seen it, and it will come out of it, and they will will come to the central revealing of the antropologic reservation in diversity, and we have to find a style of life in the pluralist in the world of pluralist and multicultural real.
in which the wisdom of all the populations can contribute to our collective well-being
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some things that I hope is about something that I hope call it other than you have heard and I'm going to try to get some links and some links in case not noted.
I want to start with what I call the "the official dog."
Is the official dog?
The official dog's office of all the industrial society is the official official -- "If we want to massize the benefits of the city's cities, "The way to do it is to make freedom the freedom of individual."
The reason is is a lab, in the fact that freedom is in itself a value, is pregnous value, is useful, useful, as well.
The other is the fact that if we are free, each of us can act to do everything that male to do everything that male is not no one who decided to do that mass our well-being, no one who decided to be able to do anything that male is not one that decided to do anything that male is not nobody who decided to do anything that male is that if we are free, each one of us can account to do everything that masses the well-being,
The way to masses the freedom is massizing choice.
More people people had, more freedom, and more people are freedom, more hours is their freedom, more hell is their well-being.
This is so deeply rooted in the society that nobody would be dreaming it in the society that nobody would be dream.
And it's also deeply rooted in our lives.
I'm going to show you some examples of what progress has repossible.
This is my supermarket. It's not particularly large.
I lost a simple note of the unhealthy conditions.
In my supermarket there are 175 conditions, without counting 10 varieties-olive and the 12 buns that you can buy to get a huge amount of conditional condition that you can buy you to buy a huge condition that no one of the 175 ready to be your degree of gradiment.
That's what the supermarket
And then you go to the electric store, to buy a stereo: cassassroom, reader, reader, reader, amplificator.
And in this single store, there's a big audio shots of electric components --
We can do six and a half million different combinations using the components that there are in one negotising.
You need to admit that there's a lot of choice.
Other camp: the world of communications.
Once I was a child, you could get all the services, to be able telephone services, to the pat the mom of the mom Bell.
It was known the phone of the phone was not buying it.
A consequence of that, in the way, was that the phone is that the phone is that the phone is not a magic.
These days, they went away.
We have a variety of telephone of the phone cell phone of the phones that are cell phone cell phone of the phone cell phone of the phone cell phone of the phone cell phone of the phone cell phone of the phone cell cell phone of the phone cell phone of the phone cell phone of the phone cell phone of the phone cell phone cell
That's the cell cells of the future.
My favorite is that in the middle of the MP3, cut of the nose of the nose cratired.
If you don't have seen it even in the store, you're pretty much certain that it will prevent it.
And what happens is that people in the stores is that people in the stores and this question and this question and the question and the answer is "No."
It's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn't do too many things.
So, in other aspects of life that are much more important than the water, it means the same explosion of choices.
There are health care about the health is not happening in the United States that you go to the doctor and the doctor and the doctor to do.
Instead, you go to the doctor, and the doctor says, "Okay, we could do A, or B" "A has these benefits and these risks." What do you want to do these risks. What do you want to do with these risks. What do you want to do?"
And he says, "Dr. Dr. Dr. what should I do?"
And the doctor says, "A has these benefits and these risks, and B's got these risks."
"What do you want to do that?"
And you rebrought to him, "Dr. if she was me, what do you do?"
And the doctor, "But I'm not lei."
The result of the malator of malato," expression that makes it a beautiful thing.
But it is actually not a shift and the responsibility of the decision of making decisions from someone who knows something, which is the doctor, to someone else who don't know -- and almost certainly is not not not in condition, to make the real decisions that the patient patient.
There's a huge amount of drugs that are drugs, directing people like and you, if you think about it doesn't have a sense, or that we can't buy them.
But if we don't we buy them, why are they public them, why are they they pulled them up.
The answer is that they want to door to ask ourselves, we call the doctor to change the reception.
And a few of so fundamental as it is a question of choice, as you see in this view, as you see in this viewing viewing children. They will shouldn't be children. They don't want to be more identity." It's not about an identity: we need to invent it.
And we can reinvent how many times us we get aggrade ag.
That means that every morning --
And it respect to the family and matriage a time perspective perspective of the community, it was that they married the most preme possible, and it was able to get the most premived, and it was able to the most premived.
The only real choice was with chemicals, not when I don't even what to do later.
On the day, it's really going to play out.
I think I think of a very smart to students very smart at least at work for a time.
And not because they're less diligent because they're less diligent -- not because they're less diligent.
but why they're implemented to ask yourself, "Would I married or no? I should do it no?
"Would I have to marriage me to think before the kids or care?"
I'm all oring logorder.
And they try to answer these questions, even if this implements not completing the companies that I listens and not get a good vote to my exame.
And they really have to ask it. It's a very important question.
Now, the work, we are lucky, like Carl underground because technology allows us to work every minute, every day, from every day, from every single angle of the planet, except from the Hotel Randolph.
And in the parent, there's a corner, and I'm not going to tell anyone where the WiFi works.
I don't say I say to use it.
What does this amazing freedom of choice we have about the work of choice we have to continuously decide to work on every moment, if we have to work or not.
We can go to see our son playing calculus with the cell phone in one pocket in the other, and the notebook, typically, on the knee.
And even if they're all sorts of the spining part, we also see our son rovince that we are also asking this call?"
"Do I have to answer this email? I have to email?"
And even when the answer is "no," all this makes the experience of the parent of your son is very different than what would be in other conditions.
So, anywhere we look at all we look at the little big, things and style and stils of life, life is a question of choices.
Once the world was this: Obous, there were some chance, but not all of a choice.
The world today looks like this: The dilemma is the positive thing is, "Is it a positive thing or negative about?"
The answer is the Sunce.
The positive lights all of them all -- so I'm going to talk about the negative laws.
All this choice behavior two negative effects on people.
The first thing is that it produces paradow is that it makes a paralyside.
With a lot of options between the which it becomes very difficult to do it.
And I give you a significant example of the volunteer of fluntary pensions.
A link of my colleagues had access to the data from Vanguard, the gigantest society with about a million clients of planning employees in 2,000 different companies.
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are coming to more, the percentage of descenes of the fabric of 24 percent.
With 50 founds -- there's 10 percent in less than degree than dealth of it is only 5. Why?
Because with 50 founds that choice is malever, and the choice is sick to decide and choice comes to the question.
And I still ask question, and I wonder, question, and of course, the questions don't get out.
You know that not just means that this is that these work from old food for dogs because they don't have enough money, it doesn't want to say that decision is so obstical that even the foundation of the workers of the data data of work.
Not to be losing and they are losing up to the data, which would be pretty well disposed to verse.
So the paralysis is a consequence of having too many choices.
And I think that makes the world like this.
"And finally, for the ethchup, do you make a maion?
You would just want to take the right decision to the right decision if it's eternity, right?
You don't want to choose the wrong fund and you don't don't want to choose the wrong condition
So this is the first effect -- the second one is that even though we can avoid paralysis and make a choice, at the end of how we would be staded by less options between the results.
And this for several reasons.
One of these is that with a lot of conditions between the which you choose and not perfect one is easy to imagine you could do a different choice that would be better choice that would be better than it would be better better than it would be better than the choice of choice, and the remultimately enduced by the decision of the decision of the decision of the decision of the decision that decision of the decision that the decision of the decision of the decision of the decision that it would be better
even when it was a good decision.
More choices are the more you disjoined by any details that is insoddisfactive option of choice.
And also there's what economists call the expensive opportunities.
DG: The Gilbert has a very good stamming like the value that we give things to the things that we compare to the conductill about.
And after that, when there are a lot of options possible, it's easy to represent the characteristic ressslowich is choice.
Here's an example. I get to all the people that are not in New York City.
But that's what you would probably think about it.
There's this copy to Hamptons.
A place of the slowest place.
Spile splendid. Ock day.
Not anything. But what he thinks is this: Well, maledibling is Ago."
"All my neighbors in Manhattan is alive.
"I could parking your home."
And it goes two weeks that we have a sense that it's losing -- every day -- the chance of parking -- every day -- the chance of parking where it wants.
The cost of opportunity decreasing the relief, even when the choice was excellent.
And the more are the options that we have to consider -- more the characteristic characters are going to come up with how constantly cost-opportunity.
Here's another example.
This is a lot of things.
It talks about living the moment, and maybe slowly.
But the most important point is that anything you chose to choice, you can get it others.
The things that we don't choose to these are a lot of attractive attractive what we do.
Third point: the spiral growing of expectations.
I tried it on my skin skin buying a new jeans.
And I just just take jeans.
Once jeans were just a typical bought and dress were swing out of the best, only after you took them a life and washed a lot of times, they would start to go right.
So I went to buy a couple of new when the old guns, and I said, "I need a couple of jeans, this is my cuteans, this is my cuteans, this is my cute."
The committed said, "You want slim fit, relam fit, relaxed it?
Do you want to do with the cernier or the bottonies? "Hed" or "acidd?
"Do you want the roade of that?"
"Would you want to get larghts or stret? Ble bla bla.."
I was sbalance, and after a little bit of I could say, "I want the kind of chee," and it was not a little bit that I had no idea what I was so I tried all of maleans who had been sick jeum, and then came out of the negoti, with the best couple of jeans that I had ever had had had had had ever had.
It was the massive I had the choice I had the best.
But I felt worse.
Why? I wrote a whole book to understand it.
The reason I was worse is that with all that choice is that with all that choice my expectations were altising, the jeans had to be perfect.
At the beginning I had expectations of minim. I wasn't expected to be a type, but when it was living 100 different places, at least a kind of had to be perfect.
What I had acquired was good, but not perfect it.
After I had the chosen that chosen with what I was trying to be insected in the expectancy.
The adding of options in the lifetime of people don't increase the expectations that these are respected to the options of options itself.
And this will produce less soddispheration, even when the results are good at it.
None in the world of marketing if it is matters matter.
Because if you know that I was talking about.
The truth looks more like this.
"You were better when it was worse that the reason that it was better when it was worse is that when it was worse is that when it was worse you would get to meet the pleasures pleasure.
Over the world we live -- opulent opulent industrialized citizens the expectation of perspective -- the we can hope is that things are at the height of the expectancy of expectancy of expectancy expectancy of the expectancy of expectancy --
You never have been surprised because your expectancy, my expectations, my expectancy, my expectancy, and you get ingigantics.
The secret of happiness -- what you're here -- is "Basasasit" "Yeah, I want."
I mean -- little bit of a little authobiographic moment, and my wife's really stupendy.
I couldn't have a better better mechannel, I don't have to do better.
But you get it is not always a bad thing.
And finally, a consequence of buying a couple of jeans comoid when there's only that jeans is that when you're not satis; and you ask you why?
"Who is responsible?" The answer is clear.
The world is responsible. What could I do about it?
When there are hundreds of jeans, and you buy a insoddisfacting, and you ask you is responsible responsible responsible responsible for you to be the responsible responsible responsible you to it.
You could do better.
With hundreds of varieties, there are no excuse for insuccess.
So when people take decisions, even if the result is valid, they feel insodden and they give the same.
In the last few years the depression is exploded in the industrialized.
I think a significant factor -- not the unique -- but important -- this hondipression is just that people have deluent experienced because standards are too alone.
And when they have to explain this situation think that the hilt is them.
So the final result is that we are better, objectively, but we feel worse.
Let me tell you about it.
This is the official dog, what we all take for good and it's completely fail.
There is no doubt that a little choice is better than that doesn't have to have a lot of choice is better than a little choice is better than a little bit.
There's a critical value of critical value, I don't know what it is.
But I'm sure we have overwe'd over, the level that the level that the choice better.
Now, from political perspective -- I have almost finish -- from the polician is the following point of policy is the follow.
What it allows all this choice in the industrial society is the material wealth society.
There are a lot of places in the world, and you know about it, in which the problem is not that they have too much choice.
The problem is they have too much a little bit of it.
So the factors that I'm talking about is a malaria of modern man's exclusive modern society, rich society
And what it does to depress and angry is this: Steve Levitt talked about how the expensive and sweat seats seats are useless. It's a wasting of money.
I mean that these choices, complicated and dispended on this is not just that they're inuseleless.
They're even deleterious in the middle of the web is deleting with the weird.
We make us worse.
If a little bit of what in our societies societies would be reverted in those where people have too much choice was going to be the life to improve and between, but the name of it.
That's what economists call a paretyan improvement improving paretian improvement improving
A redistribution of the redition is good at all -- not only to the poor -- because of this choice in the excess that it would be down.
To conclude itself, you can become all what I want,
You know, people in culture, they think about it, "What does it creates that fish?"
"It's obvious that you can't make anything in a vetrow of weld."
"A fall casting view of the world's ...
And I also interpreted it so I got it on the beginning.
But then, I think about, I realized that that that the fish is the long knowing it.
Because the reality of the fact that if you managed the mouse of the mouse of the bocky is not freedom. You get the freedom.
If you romp the mouse that all becomes possible to decrecrease.
You get the paralysis, and you reduce the wealth.
Everybody needs a sphere.
This is almost certainly too close to the fish, maybe even the fish, and certainly for us.
But the absence of some symbolic symbolic symbolic same, temo, for the rovine --
Thank you for heart.
