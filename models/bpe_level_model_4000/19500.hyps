And I showed these slides to show that the slide to demonstrate that the calculation is about three million years has had the size of the 48 United States in the continental continents, it's been strets of 40 percent.
However, this is the gravity of the problem because it doesn't show the ice of the ice of the ice.
The arty glacial calcalculation is -- in a sense, the clear of the global climate system.
He's expanding and return.
The next slide is going to be a rapid cardly in the last 25 years old.
The ice lost ice are red-to-re-a-a-to-away.
As you can see it sweeps until the blue blue blue box.
That's the ice in the inverse that you return.
You can see that the cosident ice of five years or more, is how the blood, which is how the blood, which was the body here is the body
In 25 years old, it was like this, at the way.
This is a problem because the re-scale concern the ice of ice around the ocean around the ocean where there are huge carbon on on -- and they have a huge amount of carbon micros.
And it turns out to the total inner atmosphere from global warming, which is global warming, that amount could double this point of not return.
In some lages in Alaska is already reboiling the meter is already reboiling from water.
The professoral Katey Walter of the University of Alaska was readed with a team flexise last inver.
Video: Wow! Al Gore: Le's good. The question is if we are also going to be in the way.
And it's why this is that this is that this termal exchange from the north.
This is a glacial record phares.
And he had never reached levels.
This is the Kangerlussuaq, in the soil of the Groenland of Groenland in the soil of the Groenland of the Groenland of the Groenland on the Southwest of the Groenland on the Southeater.
If you want to know how you feel the sea ice at the sea ice of ice on the ground, here is where the sea.
These are going to be increasing very quickly.
Another part of the plan: Antarctic, the biggest block of the planet.
The last month of scientists have dilarge-to-ex-to-a-negative companies is in negative, and that Antarctical along, which is particularly rapid in the science.
Equival six feet of water, like in Groenland, like Groenland,
Himalaya, the third largest blocking, you see new laghi, and they see new laghi, who were ice ice --
The 40 percent of the world's population reception.
Her Ande: this ice is the water source of the water water water of this city.
The laughed is increased.
But when he diminusible, the same happens to the water water water water as a pound.
In California neve on Sierra Nevada is deminual of 40-percent.
The hydrodrogen are in crisis.
Sorors, as you have read, are several
The growing sexual growth in the world leads to a fixed nor of the incended.
The environmental disasters are increasing a re-out of the normal and without precedentles.
Four time I think more numbers in the last 30 years of respectles.
This is a game of all insustainable.
If you look at the history context if you can see the consequences.
In the last five years we added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the oceans every day.
Look at attention, the oriental area of the East Amer, which is in the subway to the subject of the subcontinent of the subcontinent of the subject of the rise of the oceans.
The greatest because of the global warming, with the deforestation, which is 20-percent, is the use of fuel fuels.
The oil is a problem, and the carbon is even worse.
The United States are one of the two countries with more emissions, together, with China.
And he proponded to build a lot of other central central central carbon.
But we're assisting to a direction of direction.
These are the projects of these are the last few years and some alternative evidence of the last years and alternative evidence.
In each way, there's a political lotta in our country.
The carbon industry and oil, they spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote carbon and oil, which is a oxymore.
And that image I remember somewhere --
Veras Natal, in Tennessee, where I lived -- there was a 3.8 billion glass of carbon dishshsheet of carbon dioxide dies.
Maybe you've seen it on the news of news
This is the second big flow in America.
It happened around Natal.
The natalization of one of the carbon industry.
Video: He's coal ♫ ♫ Frosty the carbon is a kind of hallegrand happy.
It's abundant here in America, and it makes our economy.
Frosty the carbon is increasingly more clear and more cleer and more clear and more cleaner and more cleaner and more cleaner and more cleaner.
It's a good price, adorable and the work work are sent to be the rights.
Al Gore: From here is a lot of the coal West Virginia.
The biggest society in the mountains is Massey Coal. This is his friendly. This is his friendly.
Video: Don Blllland, I was going to be clear -- Al Gore Gore, Ny Pelove, Harry Reid -- they don't know what they're talking about.
Al Gore: So the Alleance for the Clima Proteation of Clima has launched two campaigns.
This is a bit, a party.
Video: Atte: Atte: Wa's climath as a serious changes as a serious seria as a serious seria to our business.
So this is to invent a big amount of money in a big amount of money in a switch to make public and consticks and consuming the truth of the carbon and constantly the carbon.
In fact, the carbon is not spore.
We think it's clean -- has a good profume.
So you didn't preocupathy of climate change.
Let me do it.
Video: Atte: Can pulip -- you've heard a lot of heard a lot of it.
So let's do a whole structure in a structure of the avanary for how it is carbon on on the clean of the clean on a structure of the fuel of the coal coal coal in a structure of the sea as a structure of the power.
Straordinary cars are a little rolling nomore, but this is the sound of the technology of the carbon technology of the carbon technology.
The carbon consumer is between the main cause, but the night of global warming, but the night technology of the carbon is that you can change everything.
Take a check: this is odierness,
Al Gore: Infine, the positive alternative to the economic issues to the economic issues and the national economic issue.
Video: Comment: SAmerica is in crisi; the climate economy, the national economy, the climate crisis.
The file that the connects to everything: our dependence from fuel fuels -- like the coal coal and oil oil oil oil oil and oil.
Now, yet, there's a new solution for user.
America: 100percent of clean energy -- in 10 years old.
A plan to re-to put America, to work and make us several res, and help to stop the global warming.
Finally, a solution that is to solve our problems.
America. Scover America. Scover more.
Al Gore: This is the last of the last of the last
Video: He's reease energy to America.
One of the fastest ways of bring to the end of the fuel dependence that kills our planet.
Comparsaying, the future is here.
Most two: Novi investment for jobs for a lot of work work for a good jobs.
Commention: Repower America. It's time to be realists.
Al Gore: A old proverbio African E-God says, "If you want to go fast, you go to the sun.
If you want to go away from it, you go back together."
We have to go far away from it.
Thank you very much.
Last year at TED I did a TED introduction on the LHC.
And I promise to go back to the bear on how the machine.
So I did it -- and for the other time there is no her, the La's greatest scientific experiment, ever tried -- 27 miles of circumst.
Her compit is to rear the conditions that were fewer than a billion of second from the beginning of the universe -- until 600 million times a second.
And that's all of this is just the hall.
This is the car below the car below the Ginev.
We Fotography these min-Big in rewards in the remarkators.
This is what I work. It's called AS -- it's called AS -- is 44 feet and has a 44-meters and has a 2,000 feet
This is an ATLAS image in construction in built so you can see the evidence.
The 10 secember of the last year we have accesor the car for the first time.
And this picture was taken by ATLAS.
It was because of immense in the control room in the control of control in control of control.
It's a picture of the first fashion particles that had done all the LHC, entering into collision, deliberately, with a part of the LHC, and spread particles inside the reach.
In other words, when we were seeing that image the 10 secember, we realized that the machine works, the machine that is a big live.
I don't know if it was doing this to be more open, or this, when somebody went on Google and saw that the beginning was this:
That means that we have a cultural impact beyond in the scientific impact on scientific impact of the scientific impact of the scientific impact on the scientific impact of the cultural impact of the scientific impact of the scientific impact of the scientific impact of the scientific impact of the scientific impact of the scientific impact of the scientific impact on the scientific impact of the scientific impact
About a week later, there was a problem with the machine was at these movies here -- these dors.
These files are 13,000 prints when the car car works at the massive of the power.
Now, the technicians between you look at the files and dirann't, "It's not true. I'm film."
And instead they can do it because when they're very fresh cosident films.
So, at least 271 degrees, at a nurse temperature in the stelles, these files can bring that it down.
In one of the junced the most of the nine in the LHC, there was a fabrication.
So the movies of surprising ready, and 13,000 prints suddenly met a electrical resistence.
This was the result.
Now, this is even more impressive, if you think these magnetic fishery fisherses, and that are moved about 30 centimeters.
They have about 50 magnets.
We had to take them to tell, what we did to do.
We have repristined and cousted.
Now they're now coming back to their place underground.
By the end of the end LHC will be new inteam.
And I accendered it, and we expect to get the right data to jugment, and continue so our adventure to find what are the morning, and we are the universe.
Now, of course, in a way, these are reaccendending the debate of science and engineering, and science engineering. It's easy to confuting. It's easy to confuting.
I think that the fact that it's so difficult to go beyond the limits, I think this is the value of things like LHC.
I would like to conclude with the words of a scientist Ingl, Humphrey Davy, the qual, I guy, the paper of his puzzle, his pupill, his pupill, his pupill, he said, "No is that it's a dangerous for the human mind of human mind as the remarkable to degree of human mind that are definitely definitely degrees that are not mysteries in nature that our trionfes are new mons of the triwer."
Thank you.
I want to start asking you to rethink about how to be a kids, you play courage courage couragged with the morning.
While you realize how to reach them and grab them and grab and move them, you learn how to solve and solve it is actually to think and solve social relationships.
The space is deeply connected to the way we understand the world around us.
So, from the informath of our interaction with our interaction with the physics, with my own own own own Pac, and my Jeveevan Kalanithi, I started asking herment: "And when we use a computer, instead of having the only souse of the mouse of the mouse to a digital mouse that is on a digital fear that it will move on a digital stopping information with both mans,
and systems our pleasure to our pleasure to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do it for our pleasure to our pleasure to system?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer, building the answer, building Siftable.
In a few words, a Siftable is a big computer interactive computer.
In a few words, a Siftable is a big computer interactive computer.
You can move with the hand the hand they can see the hand, and they have a screen and they have a screen and a wireless radio wireless and a wireless radio wireless and a wireless radio wireless to it.
But especially they're objects, as physics, as the morning, you can just move on the flying morning.
The Siftable is an example of a new ecosystem for a new instruments to manipulate information information
And as they become more physics, you know about the movement, and others, others, and as they become more physics, and the others, and as they become more physics, of others, and how they move them to move new and fundamental stildy interaction.
I'm going to start with some simple examples.
This Siftable is configured to show vide: if you walk it into a direction of the other direction -- if you walk from the other hand, if you walk from the other hands back.
These interactive active arts are conscious consciouss.
If they are interested in what they are interested in what they wish them.
If they come circums, they can again a little bit.
If they come circums, they can again a little bit.
They also have their movement, and including them.
And then we realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was the common on data, to an example of the data -- a color.
In this case, we have three Siftable configured as a slaughter and I can use them to be able to be able to be able to be missing the color in the central that they miss it.
and I can use them to be able to be in the central that in the cent, where they missed it.
If we are too much of it, we can reach a little bit of it.
And there are also beauty possibilities of learning, like languages, the mathematics and gives where people can try and see the results, and you see the results of the immediately.
I'm now --
This is a Fibonacy I do with a program of equations.
Here we have a game of words that is in the half of Scarabeo and Boggle.
Pratically, at every turns, I got a letter on every Siftable, Prically, every turning of any turners have a letter to be on any switches on a dictionary.
And then after about 30 seconds are remissed and a new set of reading and new possibility to try and new possibility.
Thank you.
So here's the children came to the Media Lab, I did it so that they tried them and I turned a video of it.
They are pleasuraged a lot of it.
And one of the interesting things of this kind of application is that you have to give you a lot of educational educations.
You just say, "Compions of words, and they know exactly what to do.
That's how people who try it.
This is our head of the younger heads --
It really wanted to be employees.
They only were morning, for him.
Now, this is an applation of a cardon.
We wanted to build a tool, for the learning of the English English is Felix.
It can be able to be new characters in the scene, soil switches their associated.
It can be able to be new characters in the scene, soil switches their associated.
And that's doing the sun.
Video: The sole is surprise.
David Merrill: Now has taken a treat the scene.
Video: The treatment treatment.
Bel work!
So I walk the Siftable and put the neighbors can interact the characters --
Video: Bau!
-- by inventing your story.
Video: Ho!
DM: It's a story with the open final open and it can decide him how you want.
DM: It's a story with the open final open and it can decide him how you want.
Video: God of the way,
DM: The last example I have time to show you is a tool, made recently recently recently for the sampling and exeguing music.
It's a tool, made recently, of recently, for sampling and exeguing music.
Siftable here act sounds like based on the lower and bacteria --
Every one of these has four different variations, and you can choose what you use.
You can inch these sounds in a compounds in a compound.
And to modifiction to just touch a sounds and a "Redan."
These are actually you can control of the living -- as the reveration and filter.
You attacks to a particular sound and then including it.
And then there are general as time and volume, which is apply to the interview.
Let's look at how it works.
Video: Five M: We're going to try to put a basis in two Siftable "sequence," we add in a seriously, the extreme other based on the other basis.
I am a bandwide line.
Video: DM: I add percent of ussiony;
Video: M: And I'm going to put the bacteria, so I can control the effect of the live.
Video: DM: I can fast the entire sequence from a size,
Video: M: And I'm adding the bottom to give the bottom to give more expression.
Video: DM: I can recombined the Redwood."
So I have no plan to plan before, but I can sudden, you can make it longer longer longer or more cord.
And now, finally, I can sfue the entire sequence on the left the Siftable to the left the Siftable "volume."
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is to build new interfaces of man-machine is always more like how our brain workers work and cord.
And today, I have time to show you one of the results, and some possibilities that we try to bring out of the lab.
The concept I want to put is that is coming this new generation of the design objects that are designed to interact with digital digital media in our world in the way we want to do it in our world that we want to do it in our world that we want to do it to do with the digital interacting with digital digital media objects, which we want to do it is that we want to put on this new generation of the world that we want to put it to be in
Thank you very much.
I don't see the time to talk to all of you.
I'm a writer.
And I wish books is my profession is more than this, of course, but it's more of this, of course,
It's also love and the fall of my life.
And I don't expect that it can change.
But that, something particularly happened in my life and in my career, who was in my life and in my career, which took me to receive the whole relationship.
The particular thing I have recently recently this book, this biography called "Mangia, Prega, Prega, and I am the quality, for some libris, for some reasons, for some reasons, for some reasons, for some reasons, for some reasons.
And the result is that anywhere you go to now, people who treat me as if I was condanned.
It is true -- condannata!
They are they from me to me all concerned and they said, "You don't have to be able to do better.
You don't have to keep writing for all life without the life without any more to be able to create a book that could be able to do a book that could be important to someone?"
that can be important to someone one?"
It's rassicuring, you know.
But it could go worse and worse that I remember 20 years ago, when I started to say to people -- I was a adolescent -- I wanted to be a writing.
I would go on the same based on the same reaction reaction from the land.
And people said, "Don't you have to have succeed?
You don't fear that the humiliation of refute to kill them?
You don't fear to do this mestize for all life without that anything you ever come out and die of a smart of a smart of slaming with the mouth-bank bygen s?"
So, you know, you know.
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is: "Yes."
I am about all of those things.
I always had fabule.
And I have also papers of many other things that people can't have to be inject.
As the alcom and other things that you have.
But, for how much about the write what I thought and I was asking me about what is it?
Is it ration?
It's local that anyone should expect to be spent by a work that you feel at the work that you feel for the doing.
But what is that is that particularly in the imprese creative to make us about the mental health care in a way that other carefully not fan?
As my father, for example, he was a chemical engineer and I don't remember one of one in its 40 years of activity where he was asked if he was asked if he was asked if they were afford engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be able engineer to be able to be engineer to be asking chimproof of a chemical engineer and I don't remember one of a chemistry and the activity that was asked if he was asked if he was asked
It was never -- that block of engineer John, how do you do?
He didn't work like this, right?
Onestly, the chemical engineers like a group of these are not certainly in the seat, and adagnated the reputation of being alcolized by the conversation of being alcolies.
We wrote this reputation and not only writers but creatives of any generous of every general, we have this reputation of being enormously instable to be minding.
And it's not really, that is going to look at the tristage of the magnifies of the magnificent of creative that only in the 2th century, and often often to hand they are often often to them.
And even those who are not suicide seem to be really, disappeared.
Norman Mailer, before he died, in the last interview. He said, "Of my my book has killed me a little bit more extraordinary about the work of their life.
But we don't drink when we feel about it because we have heard these things so much longer that we have completely interiorized and accepted the notion that creativity and suffering are somehow legate and the art, and the art, and the art, and the art, and then it will always be in the front of the does.
And the question I want to bring to all of today, is you agree with this idea?
And that's good, because it looks like -- because it looks like a hundred of distance to me not for anything about this support is not good for this supposition.
I think it's odie.
And I think it's also dangerous and I don't want to see the perpetuated in the next century.
I think it's better to encourage our big minds creative minds.
And I know that in my case -- in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to start to be out to be the constantly of the circumstances that are in my career.
Ovely -- but look at it, I'm pretty young people -- I have about 40 years old.
I have about four decades of work in me.
And it's very likely to do that everything I wrote about now and then it will be judged by the world as the work that came after my last book.
He was going to be slavery, because we're all more or less friends here -- is likely to my greatest shoulder.
Oh, Gesood, which though.
You know this is the kind of thought, that brings a person to start to be brought in the mornine and I don't want to do it.
I would just just go to do this work that we do.
So, the question becomes up, right?
And so I seeds me, after a lot of reflection that the way to work and write is to create a psychological costructure,
I have to have some way to find a security of me, which I'm writing -- and my natural natural reaction of what it was reaction to get the last year models on how to do it starts to look at the time, trying to find other societies of doing things as we could have better ideas to look at the time, trying to find other societies and more health ideas and more health ideas and more blood ideas about how to do we have better ideas and healthcare about how to do we have ideas about about how to do we have ideas about
how to help people create creative people to manage the risks of creativity.
And that research took me to the Greek and ancient Room.
See it because yet, and then you get back.
In the ancient Greek and antics Rome -- people didn't seem to believe that creativity came from men in the men are in?
It was thought that creativity was this spirit looks like this spirit and that came out of the men from a few surprising and unknown -- for distant reasons, and unknown as away.
The green were called these conversation dives, the secreativity of creativity "demony."
Socry, wonderful, he believed to have a demon the sagain s;
The Romans were of the same idea, but called that spirit of spirit without a genius.
And that's great, because the Romans didn't think that a genius was not really a genius particular genius was a particular genius was a particular genius of the genius was not really really a genius of a genius was really smart genius was a genius of a genius of a genius of a genius of a particular genius of that was a genium of a particular mind of a genius was not really really really like a gen
They thought that a genius was this sort of divine that was actually living in the murs of the study of a artist, a little bit like the articket Dobby, and who came up to hidden the work of the articket and modeling the result of that work on that work on that work.
Ecceptional -- -- -- that is the distance of what I talk -- that psychologists that protect is protected by the results of your work.
And everybody knew that was so that it was so that it works, right?
So the ancient artists were prottable artists were prottofed by the way, right?
If your work was exceptional -- you couldn't take all the mer, all knew that were helped by this incorporea.
If your work fail, it was not all the time.
Everybody knew that was your genius to be a inable to be a inable to be a inable to be a inable to be a inable to be a inable to be a inable to be a inable to be a inable to be a inable to be a inable to be a inable to be a inable to be a inable to be a inable to be a inable to be a inable to be a inabout.
And so people han creativity in Occident for a long time.
And then the Rince came and everything changed and everything is about it, and we put this big ide; we put the human beings and mysteries and mysteries without more to creatures, and without more to creatures, and without more to creatures.
This was the principle of the human-rational human and people started thinking that creativity came to think that creativity came out of the ish.
And for the first time in history, it started to reference this artist or that artist as a rather than a person with a person of a genius.
And I have to tell you, I think it was a big mistake.
I think that I would allow somebody to believe that you can be as a recipe as a recipe as the source and the sisters of all the mysteries of all the mysteries of a responsibility, unknown to fragile fragile -- it's a very good to give to the fragile of human skin,
It's like asking somebody to ingoate the sole.
It deform and distores completely the ego and creates all these ingestiable expectations on the lost.
And I think it was this pressure to have been destructed to the artists in the past-year-old artists in the past.
And if this is true, and I think that is, the question becomes up, and ear?
Can we do it different?
Maybe go back to a more ancient understanding of the relationship between humans and mystery creative understanding.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we can't cell 500 years of thinking about rational though.
And you probably have people between the audience that would be a suspectty suspects on the notion of the notion -- you have people are going to follow their projects.
I probably don't convinced you all about this thing.
But the question I would like to bring is -- why no?
Why don't you think about this way?
Because it has more sense of everything that has ever heard to exhhasperantantly imprevedibility of the process of creative process.
And one process that anyone who ever has tried to do something -- therefore, all of course, here -- you don't have rational behavior.
And in fact, it can be completely paranormal.
I did this recently recently with the amazing poetnal Ruth Stone, which has now 90 years, but it was a poet-year-old poet-old brought in the rural, and he was working out in the walls, and he was going out in the field of the slands.
He said that he was like a fragorous fragorous fragony.
And he came rotoling to her from the landscape.
He felt to get it to be able to get the land under its feet.
He knew that we had one thing to do that point and he was like, "currenter."
And so it was going to be initiated by this poetry, and he would not have to make a piece of paper and a mate, as the trading, as it was going to collective and it on the page.
Sometimes he couldn't be fast enough, so it was so correcent and correcent and recourage without getting to the roll and she was going to be roolating through and she would be rolled to roll through the landscaped and he would be rotolating through the landscape and so it would be in the pathete., and she would be able to be able to get into the land.
And then there were the time -- this was not going to forget, there were moments where the was almost lost of the time that was almost loss that was almost loss that was almost loss --
So, he was going to go home and she was looking at the card and it was going through the card and it was a make, and he was a make, and then he was like it was like to be hand and the steel off.
He was the poem of the coda and releasing into his body and it was going on on the page.
And in these cases, the poem would be presented on the perfect page, and intacted, from the last word at the last word at the first word at the first word at the first word at the first word at the first word at the first of the last word at the first word of the first one and I was the first one of the last word of the first one of the last few of the first word of the first time.
So when I felt I heard -- it's a crazy achieve, it's exactly the huge.
I don't have a creative process -- it's not a conducture!
I'm a mul, and my way to work is -- I can see on the same orary every day and sweet and work on and go over and go over and go over and go over and go over and go over and go over and go over the time.
But even I was in my heads; I have stripped against that thing, in the time.
And I guess that many of you have a face.
You know, even if the work and ideas came to me from a certain source of a certain source I couldn't honestly knowing it.
And what is this thing?
And how can we relate to it in a way to do that we don't lose your head, but pluttoster, what do we do to remaine?
And so as I think about it, the best example that I have is the music that I have is the music music that I have been a different years ago for a journeal.
We were talking about this, and you know, Tom, for the most life was the incarnation of the artical articking, to control these kind of impulses of control -- dominating these kind of creatives of a creatives of totally interiorized impulsized.
But then I went down to it, and a day as she was driving on a car car in L.A., and it changed everything for him.
He was going to be fast and all of a melodia, which is a little frame, which comes into his head, which comes into its head, and the wish -- and the wish -- and the wants -- and the wish -- you know, it's wonderful and the wish -- but not as you would like it.
It has no card, it has no make, it has no maker.
So it starts to feel this sort of old old anxide growing in him and say, "I'm going to lose and remarrushed by this lost seed-of-performan.
I don't am good and I can't do it."
And instead of going to go into the skin.
And he would do the entire process and made something again.
And he just looked at the sky and said, "Cusa, don't see what I'm driving on that?"
"Do you look like a song hone?
If you really want to exist, you get a more opport, you can take care of you.
Of course, I went to care somebody else in the other today's today.
And I wanted to go to the Leonard Cohen."
And his process was working on this.
I don't work was even dark as a seed.
But the process, and the fishing rhythththornight was released when he preached the genius, the genius came back to where else and freedom, and free it will remaintained and freedom, and freedom and remained it was going to be something interior and tormented.
but he was doing this peculie, wonderful bizarre bizarre a conversation between Tom and this strange thing that was not Tom.
So how much the story that is how to change a little bit that I was working and already in a little bit of a little bit of a time.
This idea, I was save when I was writing "Mangia, Prega, Ama," and it falls in one of the disperation that we all when we are working on something and we can't be thinking that and start thinking that will be a desaster, that will be the worst written written ever written written written written writing.
Not just good at the worst book write.
And I started thinking about object.
But then I remember Tom who talk to the air and try and there.
So I went to my face on the hands of the man, and I would say, my comments to a empty corporate corner of the room.
And I said, "Look, what you know, you know, I mean, if this book is not going to be brilliant not going to be brilliant, right?
Because as I see that I'm going to be doing what I have, I don't have that.
So if you want to be a better hour, you have to depresent your parts.
Okay, but if you don't do it, you know what, you know, I don't free.
I'm going to go and write the same because it's my work.
And I would like to favor that was on my own part," and I was doing my part," because -- at the end is like this, OK -- the century is in the North Africa were dances of the North Africa was very much long, dance, and music dance, and music and music sacred to the walk up to the hator and to the heat at the albe.
And they were always magnificent because the dances were professionaleres and were fantastic professionals.
But every time, I would do it happen, and one of these artists became actually translent --
And I know that you know what I talk, because I know you have seen everybody, a lost of a lost point.
It was like the time is stops, and the dance, and the dance, and he was not doing anything differently from the sun, as the 1,000 nights of the sunnnaked down.
And suddenly not as a human being.
But it turns out of the divine in and under the devictims of divinity.
And when this happened, you know, the time -- people knew what he was was, they called him with his name.
They had the hands and they started to cant, "Allah, God Did, Allah, God God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God God, Did, God God, Allah, God God, Dod God, Allah, God God, Do."
That's God, you know.
Curious nice -- when the More the Spapaper -- when the Spapaper was the south of the Spaper was in and the wide of "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, he has to be in the corrids or in the famenic.
In Spay, when a artist has done something impossible and magic -- "Allah, magnified, "Allah, magnified, you know, it's a flew of God.
And it's great, because we have to have to do it.
But the problem comes the problem comes after the dance, for the dance, when you wake up and discovers that are the 11 of the Martedn's, and last of God is not more.
It's just a mortal dead with a big mal in the knee, and maybe not will ever be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to the knew,
And maybe nobody will be the name of God as yet God and what do is it going to do with the rest of his lives?
It's hard.
This is one of the most painful results, you can do in a creative life here.
But maybe it doesn't have to be so angotious if you can not believe that it doesn't believe that it is the most amazing thing about your being being from you to yourselves.
But I just believed that there are data in prested by a imagable imagable of this teisite of the life that you have to go to somebody else when you find.
And you know, if we think in this is all change.
And so I started thinking about it, and it's sure as I thought about it for several months during the work that I was in a book that was in the period of my greatest succeeeeeed.
And what I have I have to keep telling me when I feel electron from this is, not having eure.
I don't fit to just your job.
He is going to present it for your parts, any of your party, any can be.
If your work is dance, bally.
If the divin, I assurd to you know, if you have a few kind of wonder, for a few kind of wonderful for a moment through your own sford, then "Oh it lea!"
Of course, you do the same thing.
And "Oh, you know, you know, I was going to be it.
I think I think it's deal to teach it.
"Yes!" And y!" And even for the human and heads and testing the tunt taggine and text talks to be on the same.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
And as you know I've talked about some of these projects on the genome of the human genome and discovered new genes.
We're now starting a new percorso: we started digitalize biology and now starting to the biology and now starting in a new biology, designing and synthesizing and synthesizing life.
We always tried to ask the big questions.
"What is the living?" is something that many biologists I think they have attempted to understand in the ells.
We tried a different approach, reducing the minimum of minimes.
We're digitalizing by almost 20 years ormas.
When we sequenced the human genome was treated to be treated to be from the world of biology to the digital world of the computers.
Now we ask ourselves to this: can we regenerate life, or create new life from this digital universe to the digital universe?
This is the map of a small organism, the genitalium, the genitalium, which is the species of the smallest genome of the smaller of the laboratory.
And we tried to reduce the genome to create one more smaller than one of the little bit of it.
We can get a gene hundred genes of genes about 500 that are here.
But when we have a check at the metabolic map of the nostring at the nostreng.
I think that's simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate a time, it's very unlikely to be able to be able to be a living cell viding.
So we decided that the only way to progression was synthetizing this chromosome, so that we could modify the components to report the some of these questions.
And so we started the bedded the "Can we can synthesize a chromost?"
Can you feel the chemistry to produce these great molecules that we never did make it before I do do do do do before I do that?
And in case of the acermative, can we make a chromoso?
A chromosome, it's just a chimical thing of the inert material.
The speed with which we are able to digitalize life is growing at the exponential remaintains.
Our ability to write the genetic code -- -- it's better progressiping for a rather than it is improving.
And our most recently, the results the bring on a curve curve.
We started more than 15 years ago.
The process has required a lot of step, starting with a bioetic review.
But we found that DNA is very difficult to be very difficult to it.
There are tens of thousands of cars in the world that product little segment of DNA, the long of 30 to 50 bears to 50 bear and it's a degenerative process -- the most selected is longer to be segment is longer to be on.
So we had to develop a new method to assembling these frames and recooling the mistakes.
And this was our first attemption, to start to start to the digital information of the genome of the Phi X 174.
It's a little virus that kills bacteria kills it.
We designed the framments, effective reefs and receptions of mistakes, and I got a molecules of about 5,000 letter letter
The interesting part of is when we took this piece of chemical material that is that we put it into the bacteria and we insered it into the bacteria and produce particles have been reading to read this genetic and to produce particles.
The virals have been released by the cell phone, they came back and they have to the E.
I talked about recent members of the petrolifes of petrolifes that they have certainly comfortable this model.
They have releaser than you.
We think this is a situation where the software can really build his own hardware in a biological system.
But we wanted to do things in greater on.
We wanted to build the entire chromosome.
They're more than 580 mile beats of genetic code code code code --
So we thought we built it in the size of the virus, so that we can change the cassette to understand what are the components of a living cell phones.
The projection is crucial and if we start with digital information in a computer, these must be very accurated.
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 the standard accurateless of a mistake for every 10 mile of a mistake
We have discovered, 30 mistake mistakes. If we had that original sequence that original sequence we never had to be able to do it.
A part of the process is designing for the 50 letters bees that are slensles, which is slate with all the other segment of the things that are smaller working together.
We try to release the only here.
You probably have a bed that we insert that we insert the flight.
Think of this is: We have a genetic code on four letters: A, C, G, and T.
Three of those reading bygen on about 20 friends about 20 friends, and there's a specific order to reading for every friends of reading for every friends.
So we can use genetic code to write words, you guys --
What we did at the beginning was self-to do it.
Some of the people have been dolphins from the fact that it was not poetry.
We have these sitgment to just uniququely unique.
There are enzyme that repair and put them assumption.
And we started to assembling segment with five to seven miles in the literal, uncle in a way to be forming segment of 24 miles at the letter to 72 miles, and they were letter to 72 miles.
On any step we made these segments in the abundance so that we are trying to make a very robate proception of being a very robed by a minute.
We're trying to automatizy the process.
So, this seems the tabellon a basket.
When we get these very longer segments -- more than 100 mile -- more than 100 midden in the E.
You get to the limits of the modern biology molecular biology to molecular biology.
So we have considered other mechanisms
We could do it of another mechanism called a recombination of homologists -- which is useful to repair the DNA to unize the DNA to unize the DNA to unize the segments.
Here is a example.
This organism, called Deinococcus radiohar, it can absorbed three million rads of radiation.
You can see in the submune square as his chromosome,
In 12 hours is reassembled exactly how it was before.
There are thousands of organisms that have been able to do it.
These organisms can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be complete --
They can live under empty.
I'm absolutely sure that life exists in space, and you get smooth to find new rich environments of water.
And he showed that this is the NASA showed that this happens.
This is a picture of the molecule that we built using these processes -- just using the liver, just using the lights of the design of inserious segments to inserious segments to inserious inserious of the molecule that we built on the process of reserious segments to inserious chance with the processis, just using these proces
The liver, I assemble,
This image was not taken with a electronic microscope microscope -- but with a microscope of a regulation.
It's a molecule so big that we can see it with a microscope slightly law.
These are pictures that cover a period,
This is the published that we did a little time ago.
They're more than 58,000 letters reading genetic code code code code code --
It's the largest of a defined structure of a definitely framework ever created by the man.
It's got a lot of 300 million ones.
If we stamp it with a 10 paper without spaces, and there would be 142 pages to transform this genetic code to transform this genetic code --
Now, how do we do it work? how can we active?
Of course, you get a virus is a game by the girls.
It's a little bit more complicated when they use bacteria
It's simpler even when it's eucariote as the ourselves of how our ourselves are the nuclear and inserirl one is basically the process of cloning, which is basically the process of cloning.
In the bacteria the chromosome, it's integrated inside the cell -- but we recently showed that we are able to do a complete trailing trapic trapile of a chromosome,
We purified a mosome,
The two are different as men are topis.
We added a few gene more in a way that we could decide what to choose for this chromoon.
And then it has a blood with the enzyme to kill all the protection.
And when we put it into the cellula was stupending -- and you open our degraphic graphic graphic -- the new chromosome, he went into the cell phones.
And we were really thought that we couldn't go old, but we tried to be in the way to be in the way to be in there.
This is one of the greatest mechanisms of evolution.
We found that a lot of species have added a second or a third chromosomes of a second and added in a second thousands of new trates.
So who think of evolution as a gene only to evolution as a gene of the biology.
There is no enzymes called restripps.
The romosomes that was in the cellula is not a one.
The cell pha-the tail-a-a-tail that we have inserito-ha.
And it has been expressed, and it has recognized the other chromosome, and it has masticed, and we were retured with only the cellula and the new chromoon.
It became blue because of the genes that we have inserved.
And in a short of time, all the characteristics of a kind of a kind of an another, and it turned out of all in a new software that we inserted in the cell phone.
All the proteins have changed, members have changed, and when we read the genetic code the genetic code is exactly what we have transfed.
Now, this might seem alchemy als, but altering the DNA software can change things in a pretty remarkable thing.
Now, I have already explained that here is not about genesis -- but progress of evolution, and I said that maybe we're going to create a new version of Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosion of this digital process of design.
Why do I do that?
I think it's obvious when we think of our need to necessity.
We're going to go from six and a half billion people in the next 40 years old.
Just to give you a example: I was born in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for each one existing in 1946; in 40 years, there are going to be a four.
We're having doing doing it now to find food, water and clean and clean and clean medicines, and drinkles, and buck for six and a half billion people.
It's going to be more harder to do for nine bills.
We use more than five billion coal barrels of carbon boiles.
That means millions of barrels to the day.
When we try to find biological processes or any kind of process to replace, and that is going to be a huge challenge.
And we have to keep the whole of the CO2 from these materials that finds in the atmosphere.
On day, because of the scientific discoveries in the world, we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I like to think that are the design components for the future.
The electronic industry is only a dozen about component, and think about how many different things are coming out.
Our limits here are the right data from reality and our imagination.
We have a techniques of these rapid rapid fast synthesization, in able to create what we call combinatory genomic genomics combinator.
We can build a big robots that can produce a million chromosomes a million chromosomes a day.
Think of these 20 million genes of different genes or try to optimize the processes to produce either and drugs or drugs -- we can change -- because of a little team, and create more biologists that in the last 20 years of science.
And it's just a selection section of the standard.
We can chance for chance to survive a chimical or carbon vaccines of ethc.
This is an instantanea of software programmed that we're working on to be able to sit and design species to be able to sit and design species to computers.
Well, we don't know how they will be the same as a year.
We know exactly what their genetic code code code --
We're now now focusing on the carbon carbon on on coal of the generation.
You have seen that you will extract ethanol from the grass.
We have carbon on on on and third generation that will use enough to be on the highest sugar, as the higher of the highest smooth or different types of thrown to the other.
But the only way the biology can have a big impact without increasing the cost of food and limiting the cost of food and limiting the availability would be transforming the cell to design the cells that are working for design cells that can reach this purpose to the cells that can reach this purpose to about 18 months.
The light sunlight combined with CO2 is a methodo; but in our discoveries in the world, we found different methods in the world, we found different methodo:
This is a organism that we have described in 1996.
It lives in the deep, at about 2,500 feet of the temperature of the water.
It creates meter from CO2 molecular hydrogen molecular hydrogen energy as a source of energy.
We're trying to figure out if we can inchanish CO2, which can easily be transported by tubes, converting that CO2 in carbon in carbon and drive this process.
So we think of a short we might be able to increase what the basic question that the basic question that the basic question is that the life."
Esactly. If you can't do it from TED, where you can?
It would be a main of energy.
And yard, we're working to use the same methods to create vaccines to create vaccines
You saw this year with the influence, we are always behind a year and with a dollar, and with a dollar, when it's about to find the right vaccine.
I think what you can change in a combinable vaccines in anticips.
And that's how the future could start to be changing, now, the tree of evolution, accelerating evolution, accellerating the evolution with synthetic bacteria --
We are so so much from the people to improve people.
Our purpose is to do it in a long way to try to do it for a lot of it. Thank you very much.
First of all I will show you the fastest as possible, some fundamental work that we took to Microsoft in a followed water, a year ago -- that's Seadragon. This is Seadragon.
It's a local environment where you can interact is that it remote with a huge amount of visual data here.
Here we are seeing a lot of gigabyte of digital photototos with a kind of a very quickly and continue, for a breast panoramic speed, and I have the images as we want to be able to be the images as we want to be able to be able to see a lot of the images as we want to have a lot of gigabyte of photos, and I continue,
And it doesn't matter how much the amount of information that we see how much are these are great data or the images.
Most are the digital photographs, but this is a scansion from the Big Library of the Congresss, and reenters in the legal legal legal of 300 megapixel.
It doesn't make a difference because the only thing that the prestations of a system like this is the number of pixel on your screen in any time. It's also a very flexible architecture.
This is a whole book of data is not images.
This is the Dickens. Every colonna represents a chap.
To show you that is just the head of your head, and we can't do something like this, to do something like this, to see that it's a real representation of the head, not a picture.
It could be a little artificial way to read a electronic book.
And I don't recommen.
This is a more realistic example of the Guardian.
Every image is the beginning of a section.
And it really gives you the pleasure of law the beauty version of a magazine of a magazine of a magazine of a magazine of a meeting.
We also did something with the corner of this particular number in the Car Wardian.
We created a fasulla in the other resolution -- much more than what you use in a normal that you use in a normal content -- and we insert content of the content content of the content content --
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile, you can see here.
Or other models, or even specific models, or even specific specific
And this really shows some of these ideas to heliminate the limits of space on the screen.
And we hope that this lady to put a few of them to the pop-up and yards of other porcheries are to be necessarily need to be necessarily to be necessarily to be necessarily to be necessary.
Of course, the map is one of the most of the most of the most of the technologies.
And I don't want to lose time, if I don't want to say that we have contributed to give them in this field.
These are all the streets in the United States is in the United States of a geospatial image of NASA.
So now we're going to go to something.
This is now that is actually from the webs; you can see it at the Web to see it.
This is a project called Photosynth, which fight two different technologies.
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual research at the Noah Snavely, a student of the University of Washington, with Steve Seitz of Steve Seitz UWashingtelii of Microsoft Szelii Microsoft Szelii Microsoft of Microsoft and collaboration.
And it's from the living on the web, managed by Seadragon.
You can see it when we do this kind of pattern that we can go from one image to the other and have this kind of experience in the other and have this kind of experience.
But the space, the space, the space, has actually a meaning.
The visualization of computer images have recorded these images together, so that they have these images together, so that you are the real places, so you can see the real roll to the Slagne South West Foundation on the Montagne Roccial lagne -- are shown in a de-show slide-show --
I don't know if I have time to show you some other environment.
There are some of them are much more space.
I want to go directly to one of the Noah's original data -- and this is from a previous prototype of Photosynthths that we did work for the first time -- to show what I think is really the key thing I think is really the key to do this technology, Photosynthoyntheum -- and it's not necessarily so much evident that we have been doing in the web.
We had to concerned about the legal and so on.
This is a reconstruction of Notreconstruction of Notre-Flickr. Basta Flickr. Basta Flickr. Basta Flickr and you get images of types in make, and I get images of these arions, aroundation represents a picture that it looks like this arions, and I think it was discovered to be able to maintain this model.
So they're all images of Flickr and were all connected to this particular level.
And it's possible to navigate this very simple.
You know, I would never have thought of finish to work for Microsoft.
It's very gratifiction to receive this kind of acvessel.
I think you can see that it's a lot of different types of framework on the ones of the phones of the SLR, a number meaning number, they would have together in this environment.
And if I can try to look at those most strange of the most strange of the most strange of it.
Many are block to face, etc.
Some of the photographs here is a series of photographs -- excold.
This is a poster of Notretacles of the correctly.
We can go from the physics of this environment.
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment. This is now now taking data from all of the way -- from the entire collective inter, from the view of visual viewing -- and all of these data together.
All those pictures become connected together, greater than the sum of the sum of the sum of the sum of the sum of the sum of the sum of the sum of the sum of the sum of the sum of the sum of the sum of the sum of the sum of the sum of the sum of the sum of the sum of the sum of the sum of the sum of the sum of the sum of the sum of the sum of the sum of the sum of the sum of the sum of the the side.
You have a model of the land that emerges.
Think about this as a promotion of Stephen Lawler on Earth virtual
It's something that grows in complexity as people who are using it, and the advantage that are uses to increase with use.
Their pictures are marked with method that are sles.
If somebody comes to the idea of contrast all these sants say the names of the nest of Notre-Sundral of Notre-suddenly resent of all of those dates, and I can use how to immergerms in the space, in that metaphors of anybody and have a different experience, and have a social experiences, and have a cross-mother and re-husb-husbits and re-huser.
Of course, a consequence of all these are the virtual models of every interesting part of the earthqueens are not only as a satellite images and satellite images and satellite memory and satellite memory and satellite memory and satellite memors.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I realized the well? What your software are going to feel about doing is that at a point, in the next years, every photograph, all the way of anyone in the world or are are basically connected together?
BAA: Yeah. What is doing is doing in practical
He's creating hyperlink, if you want to do it, between images.
And it's doing it in the basis of images.
And it becomes very interesting if you think of the rich information that many of these images are in the seeds of the imagines.
As you have a research of images on the Web and the head on the web, and the head on the Web has a lot of information about the picture.
Now, what happens if that pictures you connect all your fell your picture?
So the amount of interconnections and the amount of rich and the amount of rich that comes to be a huge classic effect. It's a classic effect.
CA: Blaise, it's really amazing.
BAA: Thank you very much.
One of the pleasure when you travels and one of the inner of the ethnographic research is the way that is the living in the wind, the traditional and the traditional bears in the wind, the sweting in the wind, it in the windwalls today, the slums.
Basti to think that the monkey is still the extra of the Meast Lattea, or that the extens of old Inuit is still cold, or that in Himalaya, the budge of the Dharm of the Dharm of the Dharm of the Dharm of the Centertain of the ancient antithropologia, and the idea that the world we are not in a sense of reality, but it's only a model of reality,
And it is a particular consequence of adaptation that our stirpe has done, good or mal, a mous, many generations ago.
And of course, we all share the essential trates.
We all hidden of it.
We are subjects to start action.
We have to deal with the deaths of deaths and whales --
We all have a art.
What it is the particular rhythm of the canzone, the rhythm of every culture.
It doesn't matter that are the Penan of the forests of Borneo, or the following of Haiti, or the Woodoo of Haiti, or the Curandal Seper Curandal Sepeper of the South Wa's heart in the heart of the Sahara.
He was my journey company in the desert a month ago, or a mouth, or a walls of the Mounangle, on Everest, the mother of the world.
All of these people are teaching us that there are other ways of thinking about existing other ways of thinking about it, other ways of distrengths in the world.
And if you reflect a minute, it's a concept that can give you a hope of it.
Insiem, the cultures of the world creating a spiritual spiritual and cultural life that has to be the planet and culture that is important for the benefits the planet as a biologists as biosphere.
And you can think of this is a culture of cultural as a ethnosphersphers' sum and you can call the eth-re-up of all the concepts of the concept, meetings are being from the imagination of the consciousness from the human imagination of consciousness to the consciousness of consciousness from the alba of consciousness to the consciousness as a culture of consciousness as a
The ethnosfer is the amazing pathrimony.
It's the symbol of what we're and what we can be in how much as inquisitive.
And because the biosphery, as it was quite consumed as as it happened at the ethnosphers;
No biologist, for example, would say that 50 percent of all the species is on the earthqueer of the summer of the summer of the biological issues -- in the biological issues of biological diversity -- and it's not near to the most optimistic -- that is that the most culture of cultural diversity -- that is the most culture of cultural diversity --
The indicates of all of this is, of course, the language.
When you're born 6,000 lingers on this planet.
A language is not only by a vocabulary or from a series of grammatics.
A language is the human spirit of the human spirit of the human spirit of the spirit of the human spirit is the price of the human spirit of the human spirit of the human spirit is the human spirit of the human spirit of the human spirit of the human spirit.
It's the half of the animation of every culture in the world is in the material.
Every language is a forest of mind, a skin, a sustain, a spiritual ecosystem.
And of those 6,000 langues, as we are sitting at Monterey at least half of the hand, it is not more sushed in the ears of children.
They don't get to teach the children, which means less you came, at less you came, which is already dead something, which is already dead to die.
What is it more tristates of being the last to be the last to be the last to talk about a language, of not to transmit the slessness of the adhasking the promise of the children?
This is the orring was in some of the world every two weeks every two weeks a few weeks a little bit of a few weeks a hotbelels of a ancient language.
And I know that somebody who will say, "Is it better like this?
The world would not be a better place if we were all the same language -- we talk all the same language -- we talk all yoruba. Let's talk about a chonchonchap.
We talked about it.
And you'll find a tract thing that means that we can't talk about their language.
I would like like to do a journey through the etnosfera's ethnosferasis.
a little journey in the ethnosphers' label of what we're lost in it.
Many of us forget, which when I say, "different ways of existing existing very different ways of exists.
Let's take it for example, this baby Barasana, in Amazony in Septhwidea, which creates to provide from the slymer of sacridge to come from the latest sacries.
It's a popular that is not able to distinguished the blue color, because the celeste is identified in the forest time that it depends the popular of the forest, which depends the popular of the people of the people of the people of the people of the people of the forest, which depends the population of the forest, which depends the population of the forest, which is depends the popular color that is depends the popular of the forest, which is depends of the
They have a strange language and a matrimonial rule -- ""exogamia language -- you have to be able to be a different language.
And all of that has been rooted in the past, yet the particular arity is that in these extreme in the extreme six or seven lings, no practices of the mysteries nobody is basically a language of any practices.
They just just listen to and then they start to talk about.
Let's take one of the most interesting tribes with which I lived -- the Waorani of Ecuador nordoral, an incredible popular that has had the first contatts in 1958.
In 1957 mission of the people have attempted a face.
They did it from the top photographs that they thought that they were in a few who were loss of loss that this people of pluvial forest, they had never seen anything about bi-dimensional forward bi-dimensional raissued be.
They collected the photos from the ground, they turned to the data or a shape or a shape, they don't find that they were in the diavolus, and they have five miles with the lances.
But Waorans didn't have to kill the straniera.
They have to kill them in them.
54 percent of deaths was caused by their own people.
We have been rised to eight generations and we found two natural mort deaths and when we insisted it for them was so so much of them was so so that it is dead that is dead again -- and then they killed it itself.
The caccidents were able to recognize the animal from 40 steps and recognize the species.
In the first '80s, I was assigned a very interesting thing when my professor when my professor of Harvard was assigned to me to get to Haiti to intrufolding between the secret of Duval and Tonton Macoutes, and Tonton Macoutes, and I imposed to make the suddenly usbed to make the sudden.
To make sense of a miracle -- I would have to understand Vodoun and that the Voodoo is not a black of black in it.
It's pretty much a metaphor or a metaphor of the world.
Many interesting interesting interesting time.
If you ask you to tell me the big religions of the world, what would I say to this?
Christianity, Islam, Buddhist Ebraism, and etc.
A continent came out, I think, as a sub-Saharan Africa has no flew in the sub-Saharan Africa has no religious. And instead of the distilled of these religious religious religious of nated during the tragics of slavery of slavery in the slavery of slavery in the slavery of slavery.
What makes you interesting is that makes you interesting your life and dead in the life and dead and the dead of the death.
So you saw the spirit.
The spirits can be invocated by Grande Aqua, they respond to the dance of the dance and replaced themselves to the southwish in the way that for a brief active way it becomes the following becomes the deal.
So this is why you go to saying, "You want to say, "You go to a white to talk about God.
We give them in the temple and become God."
And from the moment that you're possing, is the spirit that you drive you to do you all of the mal?
So it looks like these incredible events -- following your voodoo in the state of trances that touch touch into the state of the mind of the power of the mind of the mind of the mind of the mind of the mind of the mind of the mind of the mind of the mind of the mind of the body when it's catalyzed in a state of extreme in a state of extract of the mind when it is catalygen in the extract of these incredible events that toughts that are remaintained,
And in all the people who I have lived the most extraordinary Kogi of the Sierra Nevade Santa Marcle in the Colombia sector.
It was going to be in the ancient of the ancient of the Colombia in the careers of the Colombia in the conquist, the people were returning on the careful massive massive that was going to be on the careful massive sive.
In a health continent continent of blood continent, this people never been conquisted by the shadows of the spags.
Once today are government from a cler but their formation is decided.
The young people following out of the family to three or four years, and they live in a secregated world in a world of good and homber, and they have to be sat at the basis of the ice for 18 years.
Two periods of nine years of proposing for reducing the nine months of management that translate in the user of the mother, now are metaphors in the utero of the Grande Madre.

The prete is a splending behind and says, "Her is a past of this extra living.
"H? I mean, I have a detail.
It's stupend. Now it's to you protect it."
They call that the greatest brothers and say that we are the minds, we are the destruction of the world.
This is an intuition level.
When we think about Indian population and the environment, we invote Rousseau and the old story of the wildying, which is a no-race concept of the nice or maybe maybe invoices and say that these people are closer to the Earth of us.
The Indigenes are not not feeling ners from our own own nor from our own own ourselves from our own own own ourselves from our own own own ourselves from our own own own noithy nessons are not born the indebolding.
There is no space for these things in the malarian Asmat or in the gelides of Tibet, but because of the time and return, have created a mystic of the Earth is not about the concept of being aware of being consciously consciously as well as a bears as more underneath conscious consciousness that the Earth can live because it's human conscious consciousness
What does it mean to here?
It means that a guy of the Ande that is growing that the mountain is a spirit Apu that will be a very fundamentally different and will be a deep routely fun and will have a very different relationshiping with the mountain or that respect to a mountain or that respect to grow a mountain a mountain that is a mountain of rocks that is going to be a s-scratch with a mountain a mountain to be a sss-shops of a s-sh.
Which is the dead of a spirit or a mineral is irrizing.
What is interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between the individual and the natural world.
I grew up in the forests of Columbia credying that the forests were going to be cut for cut.
And that has rejected me a different human beings Kwakiutl who believe that the forests are the forest of Hukukuk and the beyond the bears that live in the world, and the cannibal spirits that live in the world, the nurtural bees that are living in the world that are going to be north in Hukukuk and beatsa.
If you start looking at that these cultures can actually create different reality, you'll be able to start to understand some of their sensations. We have this plant.
I took this picture to open the nordoctory in the nordoctory Amazony Amazony
Maybe some of you have heard of the ayahuase, the most powerful support of the repertower of the repertower of the repertower of you have heard about the ayahuase,
What makes it fascinating the ayahuas's not the potential potential to farmer the substance, but his elaboration. It's composed to two elements.
From a side, this lian legable series of beta-carboline, harmine and harmine molinogene.
And I mean, the only planta is blua-blua-bluewer that alters a little bit of the coffee of a coffee family, but it's measured by the coffee of the coffee.
This plants is powerful powerful powerful powerful to the serotonine, a methoxyptamine-5, methoxydithynthoxydithyptamines.
If you ever see the Yanomami yltrust the substance that are doing from a different set of species, anches of species, anch'se methoxyltryltryptamine.
Tiring that poles on the hidden is a little bit like being disappeared by a bodies of boards and landing on a sea of electricity. It doesn't create a degree of the reality of real; it creates the reality of real; it creates the reality of reality.
I was often with my professor, Richard Evan Shultes, the man who sscatended the man who got the psychchchchopen, with his discovery, with his discoverishelf of the '30 in Mexico.
Second my text is not to classifix these triptamine like hallucinogens because if you're in the none of being hallucinated for nobody to be hallucinated, because they're dened because they're denaturated because they're dened because they're denaturated to be absored because they're dened in the intestinated by a monoxywer;
It's possible to assume only if you get them with other substances with other substances that denaturing the MAO.
Now is the beauty beta-carboline that are inbats in this lian inbaby is inbaby incomment, for the same kind of a potential for triptamine. The question avoid that are 80,000 species, how these people are doing these people are in a fabulous death -- or if you combined in this way, I think, if you look at the sudden, but if you look at the sudden, but of the sudden,
We use the great eufemism of proof of and mistakes, which can reveal infrutted.
But if we ask Indians, they will tell us "Look at the plants talk."
What does it mean to here?
This tribe, the Cofan, has 17 variety of ayahuase, which distinguished in the forest, and that are our eyes in the same species.
If we ask how to stabilize their poccksets will tell us how to be able to understand plants, "I'm not knowing everyone all of this?" I said, "No."
The solution is -- they take 17 variety in a night of a lens and each each of a different honto a different different time.
And with this is not laurea at Harvard, but it's much more interesting than counting the stams.
Now, the problem is that the problem is that the ones of us who have to give the people people to give Indian people who have to get them to be painting in the history of the history of the history of the history of the history of our real real world and will go on.
In fact, the 2X century, 300 years, it's not going to remind to minate the wars or its innovations that are in which we are stopped and and we embracing and we have embracing the destruction of the diversity of biological diversity and cultural destruction of the planet. Now it's not change.
All cultures were involved in a dance of a dance for new possibilities.
And the problem is not the technology.
Indians have been not to be Sioux when they put from the ark, they put it from the ark, and so as Americans have no wise, and calculus have been calculation.
It's not the change or technology that threat the ethnosfer. It's the poters.
The domination.
And if you give you a look at the world, you will find that these are not destined to disappear.
And I am creatures and dynamic dynamic force that are yiiths that are beyond their ability to adaptation --
And I'm going to be sweats in the pathy of Penan:
a people named Sarawak, in the Sarawak, in the Sarawak, a population that lived in the forest, and now reduced to the life-up reduced reduced to the lives of rewards on the re-up re-up on re-half re-half re-half re-half a half of the Meridiond, which is a half of the Meridions, where the naves are lights of the blind the blind the labor of the Cinese
It is going to recover the stage with the legal leg.
Obbye, in the Yanomami, are the disease that have come with the discovery of the earthqueeen.
If we move on on the mountains of Tibet, where I'm doing a lot of research, you see the last fly of political domination.
As you know the genocide -- the physics of a popular popular level, but the instrument, but the instrument, the destruction of a popular life of a popular life, not only condition is not condent -- but in celebrated in certain environment, because it makes part of the strategic strategic strategic strategic strategic strategic of development.
And you can't understand the suffering,
I lost the 6,000 miles from Chengdu in the Western China in the Western Cina in the South Cental with a young line, but only came to Lhasa young line, but only came to Lhasa statistics that we feel about it.
6,000 monuments sacred in the poles and cenergy.
1.2 million people killed by military in the Cultural Right.
The father of this guy was assumed to Panchen Lama.
And that means that it was killed to be killed at Chinese time of the Chinese invasion of Chinese invasion that was killed at Chinese time of the Chinese invasion that was killed to the Chinese time of the Chinese in the Chinese time of the Chinese invasion of the Chinese invasion of the Chinese invasion of the Chinese invasion of the Chinese invasion of the Chinese agrees.
He's the guy is filled with Santity during the diaspora that has brought the people in Nepal.
Her mother was imprisoned and his color was remaintain.
It was brought in the age of two years old, bird on the age of two years old, he had no lived without him.
The sister, which has done it the same, was in reedue.
A day he was initially calculated a fashion the Mao and it was in this transgression, was mouth-year-old Mewer's workers for seven years old.
The Tibet of Tibet can be inhabitat, but the re-in-in-in-in-in-present.
At the end of the end of the choice.
We want to live in the world's world of monotony or we want to collect the world of the diversity of the diversity of the diversity of the diversity of the diversity of the world?
The big antropologist Margaret Mead, before he dimented that his greatest fear of the world, in our own vision of the world, not only will see the human beings of imagination of human imagination -- we will be reduced to a conversation of thought, but a day we can get us from a sleeping snarrative to the way that there were other possibilities.
And it's humiliating that our species is existed for 600,000 years old.
The Revolution is revolution that has given us to agriculture, which has done us to be able to be the cult of the seeds, replacing the proof of the clera, creating the hierarchy of specialization, and we talk about 10,000 years ago.
The modern world industrialized in the world has 300 years old.
That is a story that I don't suggests that we have the answers to all the challenges that we have to deal with the millennia.
When you get these are the world of culture of the world is asked what to be human, they respond to be human, respond to be human, respond to be human, respond to be human, they respond to say to be human, they respond to be human, they respond to to be human, they need 10,000 voices.
And it's in these answers that we all have riscover the possibility of being what we are.
I took this picture on the north of the north of Baffin, when I went to the whales of the whales of the whales of the Narrator has been telling the wonderful story of his grandmother's grandmodning.
The canadese is not always gentlate with the people in the '50s for the '50 to be able to be re-a-ade-and and and recouskers in colonies.
The grandfather of this man refuted to go to the

He came to school and created a bribe, with the glass, with the tornicked a slittle, and he has created a slack another dog on the while, and he has been disappeared on the wheelmmming in the board.
We want to talk about cable, with nentles? [Ristheat] And this, in different ways, [Applausian is the symboll of the people of the world.
In the 1979, the government canadese has reated to Inuit reate the Inuit has reated to the total control of California and Texas I die together.
It's their new pathria. It's called Nunavut.
It's a Indian there’s a India. They Control all the mineraries.
One of the example of how a national as a national national nation-state can reconcive with its population.
And finally, I think it's pretty obvious about who who there was in these remote areas of the planet, and realized that are not active account that are not active in remote of it.
He's home.
They represents of the human imagination that are rising at the time. And for us all of the time. And for us all of these children, as the southers, become part of our children, become part of the hopefully of the hope.
And finally, we get National Geographic we are convinced that politicians never will never be at nothing.
We think that the polemicy --
[Applausies] is not persuasive, but we think that stories can change the world, and maybe we are the best institution, to tell stories of the world. Every month our site is 35 million visites.
156 Paesis they transmitted our own television can.

where the sages of all the people can contributing to our benefits of the benefits of the benefit.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope you have heard and I'll be able to revive some links in the case you don't notice that we have heard about it.
I would start with what I call "the offic."
The official dog's office?
The official dogma official societies the Western industry is the official official and the real benefit to be a mouth-to-to-to-a-re-freedom is to be a proper to be a detect."
The reason is that it is a side, in the fact that the freedom is in the same value, is pretious for human beings.
On the other is in the fact that if we are free, each of us can act to do everything that massive to do what we are in the name of our benefit without nobody who decided to be in the name of ourselves
The way to massive way to be a choice.
More choices people are free, and more and greater is their freedom, more hours is their benefits.
This is a returning is so deeply in the society that nobody would have dream to put it in the two.
And it's also deeply rooted in our lives.
And I'm going to show you some of what progress has reside.
This is my supermarket. It's not particularly great.
I lost a simple note on conditional conditional conditional conditional conditional conditional conditional conditional conditional conditments for inities.
In my supermarket is 175 conditions, without content the 10 variety of extracks and 12 balloes of olive and 12 balloon whales that you can buy a huge number of constance that nobody is of your own cheap that nobody 175 already already already in your degrade that nobody is of your degrade and and the 12 of your degrees.
That's what the supermarket.
And then you go to the electronic snake, and reading a stere: CD, radio, radio, radio, radio, the legs.
And in this single story, there is a big audience.
We can do six and a half million combinations using the components that there are in one negoties.
We need to put that there is a lot of choice.
Other camp: the world of communications.
Once when I was a kid, they could get all the services, to pat the phones, and pat that were formed by mamma Bell.
He was born the phone, you don't buy it.
And one consequence of that, in the other, was that the telephone is that the telephone is not a make.
These days are gone.
Now we have a variety of telephone of telephone --
Here is the cell phones of the future.
My favorite is that in the middle of the MP3, cut of the hidden of the bird crush for me around.
If you don't have seen in the southern below the house below the case, you're going to be going to be going to get there.
And what is the end is that people in the southern the goths and this question and it does? And you know what the answer is "No."
It's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn't do too much stuff.
So, in other aspects of life that are much more important than water, you know, it is the same explosion of choices.
Lais: On health is not going to be in the United States that you go from the doctor and the doctor what you do.
Instead, you go to the doctor, and the doctor says, "Okay, "Would you do A, or B." "B" "B" has these sweeps and these risk."
And he said, "Dotor, what would I have to do that?"
And the doctor says, "In the benefites and these riskss, and these risk."
What do you want to do about that?"
And you rebate said, "Dr. if she was me, what would do to do that?"
And the dock: "But I'm not lei."
The result of the malato," expression that makes it look like a beautiful thing.
But it is actually not that one to move the fish, and the responsibility of decisions from somebody who knows something, which is the doctor, to somebody else knows -- and almost certainly is maled -- and so it's not in the ideal conditions.
There's a huge marketing of drugs products, I would say, "You know, if you think of you think about you don't have any sensible sense, that we can't buy them.
But if we can't buy them, why are we not buy them in the audience of it?
The answer is that they want to do that doesnine to ask ourselves to change the rich of changing us the rich of the rich that we have to do it for the reception.
Something that is fundamental as our identity is ever a question of choice, as you see in this vign, as you can be force the children. We don't want to force the right moment of the right right moment -- we have to invent the right to invent to invent the right of the identity: we have to invent it.
And we can reinvent us how many times we get us to reinvent us how many times we can reinvent us how many times we can reinvent us how many times we can reinvent us how many times we can reinvent us how many times we can reinvent us how many times we can reinvent us how many times aggrade.
What it means that every morning, you have to decide that kind of person wants to be to be able to be there.
And it was in the family and matrimoney, a time time the perspective is common to the most prevent for anyway, and it was able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do it.
The only real choice was with chemicals -- not when you don't why, and even what do you do later.
Over the day, it's really to play it.
I mean, I think of a very smart, and I do 20 percent in less work than a time.
And because they are less doubt, because they are less diligs.
But why are they implemented to ask ourselves, "What would I have to do right now, or no? I should do this right now.
"Would I have to have to think before the kids or the career or at care?"
They're interrogatives of the love.
And they try to answer these questions, even if this implements don't have a good thing that you hassegment and not get a good vote to my exame.
And they have to do it. I'm very important questions.
Now, the job: we're lucky, like Carl underlying in the technology that allows us to work every minute, every single single day, from the Hotel Randolinef that is the Hotel Randolel Randolel Randoline --
And in parents, there's a corner, and I don't tell nobody to say nobody -- where the WiFi works.
I don't say that I want to use it.
What is that meaning, this incredible freedom of choice that we have about working on the job? Is it that we have to work or not.
We can go to see our son play, with the cell phone in a pocket in a pocket in the walls, and the nice nights.
And even if they're all of the sland, every minute that we see our boy is that we are asking the title, we are asking this call?"
"Do I have to answer this email? I have to email?
And even when the answer is "no," this makes the experience of your titles in your own boy of your boy and what would be in other conditions.
So, from any part of it, little bit of the cold, and materials and style and stiles of life, life is a question of choice.
Ovo, when the world was this: Ovo, there were some possibility, but it was not a choice.
The world today is this is like this: The dilemma ism is what is you doing, or negative thing or negative, or negative, or negative, or negative, or negative, or negative, or negative, or negative, or negative, or negative, or negative, or negative, or negative is the delemma is
The answer is the answer is the line.
The good laid we know all -- so I'm going to talk about the negative of the negative of the negative of the negative lies.
All this choice behaviors on two negative effects on people.
The first one, paradoxy, paradoxy, is that it produces instead of freshing.
With a lot of options between the choice, it becomes very difficult to do it.
I offer a meaning example of a meaning studio conducted on the planets.
A connected colleagued to the data of Vanguard, the giant companies of pleasure and a company with about a million clients of plenty in 2,000 companies.
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are offered in the more, the percentage of adesion comes down to 24 percent.
With 50 sources are 10 percent in less ademic ademic adesions of when they are available only 5. Why?
Because with 50 sources of what the boats of the board, is detail, and choice is remaintains.
And I said, and I am still asked, questions, and of course, questions, and of course, the question, and of course, the question, and I said, "Yeah,
You know that doesn't mean that these work from old old who are going to be food for can, because they don't want to say that decision is so obsticle that also also the decision is so obstacy that also perspective.
They are not participation, they're losing until 500-dollar data, which would be a lot of work that would be a very well displaced to be away.
So the paralyside, the consequence of having too much choices.
And I think it makes it the world like this.
"And finally, for the eternity: ketchup, senape or maine?"
You would just be taking the right decision, if it's for the eternity, right?
You don't want to choose the wrong fundament, and nepray or the wrong condition.
So this is the first effect of the second is that if we can avoid paralysis and do a choice, and do less unddisappeared by the result of how we would be with less options between the less options.
And this for several reasons.
One of these is that with many conditions that are board, if you buy one and it's not perfect, it's easy to imagine that you could have a different choice that would be better choice. And what happens is that it would be better choice. And what happens is that the alternative alternative to the choice, and rempire it remaintaining the remaintain of the reduction of the decision that you would be better by decideflights from the present of the choice, and requid to be
even when it was a good decision.
More choices are more is to displeasure of any detail of any details that is insoddisforming of choice.
And yesterday, there is what economists call it cost-opportunity.
Dan Gilbert has a very well stamle stamle as as the value that we depends on what we confronti.
Del remake, when there are so many options, you can represent the features, and being less uncommodying, and being less soddisdistired to be choice.
Here is a example. I have all the people that are not in New York.
But that's what you probably think about it.
There's this copy to Hamptons.
A place of lussive.
It is all of the splendid. It's all about them.
It's not lack of it. But what he thinks he thinks "Well, mal."
"All my neighbors in Manhattan is lived in Manhattan is in the vid."
"I could park right at home."
And it goes two weeks with the idea that is lost -- every day -- the possibility of parking -- the possibility of parking where you want.
The cost of the inner opportunity to the soddisfation for what we have, even when the choice was excellent.
And the most are the options that we have to be considered to be considered by the most of the constantly of the opportunity.
Here is another example.
This is a lot of things.
And it talks about the moment, and maybe live slow.
But the most important point is that whatever you choice, you get it to not do the others.
And things that we don't choose have a lot of attractive actives that can make less attactive what we do.
Third point: the spiral growing of waites.
I tried it on my skins buy a new jeans.
Port almost always jeans.
Once the jeans were only a type, you buy them and vested by the smart -- they were smoked, only after having them a life and work a lot of times, starting to go good.
So, I went to buy a couple of new when the old people were gone, and I said, "I'm going to have a couple of jeans, this is my cut."
The committed said, "Li wants slim fit, relaxed fit, relaxed fit, relaxed it?
Do you want to do it with the bottonies? "Stonehed."
"Who wants to be rot?"
"Who wants to be a bank or stret? Bl, he would you take it to electrouad to elencar.
I was sbalaned, and after a little bit of a while, I would like the only one of the guy -- that was the only one of the time I did not have idea of what I was like, so for the all of the bears of the negoties, and then I came out of the negotime-to-year-old jeans that I had ever had had had had been away;
It was the mous. With all that choice.
But I felt worse.
Why? I wrote a book to understand it.
The reason I was worse that I was worse with all that choice was that with all the choice were altises, the jeans had to be perfected.
And I was waitative to me. I didn't expect to anything about exceptions, when there was only one of the type, but when I saw 100 different different acts, at least one guy had to be perfect.
What I had watched was good, but not perfect it.
After I had paragoned to what I was trying to do what I was trying to be insected in confronted.
The addition of the options of people don't make the expectations that these are respected to the options of the options itself.
And this will propack, even when the results are good at the results are good for it.
No one in the world of marketing if it makes it content.
Because if I know what I'm talking about.
The truth looks like this.
"You were better when he was worse when he was worse when he was worse when he was worse when he was worse to was worse to the prevent of pleasure.
Over the world that we live -- opulent industrialized industry, industrialized citizens with the perfeation -- the maximum that we can hope is that things are at the treatment of waitative expectations.
You'll never surprising for you to have to be unfortunately, my expectations, my expectancy, and I have ingiant for you,
The secret of happiness -- what you're here -- "Basy." "Yeah, I want."
I mean, little bit -- I am I really married and my wife is really unbelieved and my wife is really amazing.
I couldn't do better, I was not doing it.
But account is not always a good thing.
And finally, a consequence of the buying a couple of jeans smooths when you are only that kind of jeans is that when you're not uncomfortable to say, "Why do that?"
Who is responsible for here?"
The world is responsible. What could I do about this?
When there are hundreds of jeans, and you buy one insoddisface, and you ask you who is responsible responsible for you is the responsible for you to be your responsible for you to be your responsible for you to be your responsible for you to it.
You could have been doing better.
With hundreds of variety available variety of available for the insuccess.
So when people get decisions, even if the result is valive, it feels income, you feel insoddisded, and they damage to their own itself.
In the last few years of the depression is exploded in the industrialization.
I think that a significant factor -- not the uniquque, but important -- of this hondie is that people have deludent experiences because the standards are too alone.
And when they have to explain this situation thinks that the color is them.
So the final result is that in general we're going to be better.
Let me let me remember it.
This is the official dogma official, what we all take for good and it's completely fail.
There is no doubt that a little choice is better than a little choice that doesn't have a lot of choice is better than a little choice is better than a little bit better than a pot of a pog --
There's a critical value value of it.
But I'm sure we have been over, from a piece of the level that the choices improved our life.
Now, from political point -- I have almost fined -- from the political point of view, the notion of political view.
What it allows all this choice in industrial society is the wealth is the richness of material.
There are many places in the world, and you know about it, where the problem is not that have too much choice.
The problem is that they have too much a little bit of it.
So the thing I'm talking about is a mal, which I'm talking about is a mal, rich of moderns, rich societies of the Western society.
And what it does: Steve Levitt is this: Steve Levitt Levitt talked about how the cost and sweats are ineful for big, mmous. It's a money.
I mean, these choices, complicated and dispendious, it's not just inutious.
I'm just dethleteries.
They make them worse in the worst
If a little bit of what in our societies allows a lot of choice was reverted in those where people have too much possibility, it would not only be their life to be able to improve but also the nostreng.
This is what economists call a pareter improvement.
A redistributed redistributed to all -- not only to the poor -- because of this choice in the choice of this choice in the except of that we would for.
And then finally, "Foom -- you can become what I want,
Voes, people of culture, thought, "What does that make that wei?"
"It's obvious that you can't do anything in a veter."
"A imagination fall-a-old vision of the world."
