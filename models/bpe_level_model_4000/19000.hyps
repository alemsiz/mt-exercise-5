Last year I showed these slides to demonstrate that the calculation that is nearly three million years has had the size of 48 years has had the size of 48 United States, you have been rotated by 40s.
And this is the gravity of the problem because it doesn't show the ice of the problem because it doesn't show the ice of the ice.
The arty glacial calotter is in a certain sense, the clear heart of global climate system.
You expands, and you get repet and you get repeated.
The next slide is going to be a quick carrelled on the last 25 years.
The ice lost hats are red.
As you see it expand they expand it up to the blue board.
That's the ice in the winter that you get extremely extremely down.
You can see that the cosident of five years or more, is how the blood of the blood here was the blood of the body.
In 25 years is passed by this in the way of this way.
This is a problem because the kind of coal warming around the ice of the arttic where there are enormous amount of coal action of carbon congying, which is transformed in the microbial of microbial bies.
And it turns out the totalities of the global warming, which is global warming, that amount could double that amount could double this point of not return.
In some of the deep in Alaska is already rebolling is already rebolling from water.
The professor Katey Walter of the University of Alaska was reached with a team took a very last slow that was a last slow that in the last vert.
Video: Wow! Al Gore: Lay is good. The question is if we are also going to be in the time.
And so this is that this is that this termic scale of Groenland,
This is a glacial record rewards it.
And he took never reached levels --
This is the Kangerlussuaq, in the sounds in the Southern the Groenland,
If you want to know how the sale of the sea ice level of the ice of the ground, here is where the see.
These are coming up very quickly.
Another part of the planet: Antarctic, the biggest block of the planet.
The last month scientists have dilarge-launch that the ice is in negative, and that Antarctartide Western -- which is particularly rapid on some of the submarine -- it's particularly rapid in the sheet is particularly rapid in the sheep chaway.
It was six meters of water, like in Groenland, like in Groenland, like Groenland, like Groenland, like Groenland, like Groenland, like Groenland,
Himalaya, the third largest block of ice, you see new laghi, they see new laghi, who were ice in the few years ago, were ice to be glaciers.
And that is about about about about the world's population was going to be the water from the sheet of the water water from the sheet.
Sulle Ande: this ice is the source source of water water in this city.
The laughed is increased.
But when he diminues, the same happening acts in the water water water water power.
In California needed on Sierra Nevada is deminuit-percent.
The hydrogen skills are in the crisis.
The previsions, as you read -- they're grave.
The growing growing in the world door to a nice of incendes.
The environmental disasters are now now now now now by the normal and without precedentles.
Four times more numbers over the last 30 years of respect to the previous prices in the last 30 years
This is a gone of the whole sustainable of all of sustainable.
If you look at it in the history of the historical context if you can see the consequences.
In the last five years we added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons.
Look at attently, the area of the Pacific, from Amer, and in both of the subject parts of the subject of the subcontinent where there's a radical income in the ocean ocean oxygen in the ocean oceans.
The biggest because of global warming, and the global warming, which is 20, it's the use of fuel fuels.
Oil's a problem, and the carbon is even worse is even worse
The United States are one of the two countries with more emissions, with China.
And they proponded to build a lot of other central central and carbon and
But we're assisting to a direction.
These are the remarkable projects in the last few years and some of alternative versus of alternative veres.
Any way, there's a political lotta in our country.
The coal industry and oil industry has spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote carbon and the carbon is a oxymore.
And that image me to something,
Veras Natal, in Tennessee, where I lived -- there's a 3.8 billion of coal scories of carbon dies.
Maybe you saw it on the news of news there.
This is the second big flow of scories in America.
It was happening around Nat.
The natalien of a carbon industry was this:
Video: He's a coal ♫ ♫ Frosty coal is a kind of hallegry and happy.
It's abundant here in America, and it makes our economy.
Frosty the carbonaium is more and more cleaner and more cleaner and more cleaner and more cleaner and more cleaner and more cleaner.
It's a good price, adorable and the work work are housing the style of the skin.
Al Gore: From of the West Virginia.
The biggest company on the mountains is Massey Coal. This is his friend.
Video: Don Bland, I was clearly -- Al Gore, Nance, Harry Reid -- not know what they're talking about.
Al Gore: So the Alleance for the Clima has launched two campaign in the Clima has been launched two campaign --
This is a be, a hand, a part.
Video: ALergi: ALergives we see the climates of climate changes like a night-business series like a night-business series like a serious seria
So this is to invest a big amount of money in a very much money in a switch that for the public and consummtion to make public and consummition on the carbon.
In fact, the carbon is not sport.
We think it's cleaned -- it also has a good profume.
So you don't pray the change of climate change here.
Let me do it.
Video: Attor: Carbone can -- you heard a lot of it.
So we do this a kind of a structure of the water structure of how it coal carbon is going to be able to do it for a cleaned.
Straordinarily cars are a little road rows, but this is the sound of the fuel of the fuel of the clean;
The carbon is between the main cause, global warming cause, but the night technology of the carbon wild that you can change everything.
To a eye: this is the odiernice technology.
Al Gore: Infine, the positive alternative positive and the issues of the national issue.
Video: Comment: The America is in the national economy, the national security crisis.
The file that the whole lines of the fuel of fuel fuel fuel of fossil and oil oil oil oil and oil oil oil oil and mate.
Now, yet, there's a new new solution, audace solution for ushes.
Rear America: 100-percent of clean energy in the decade.
A plan to reput Americal in the work, make us sure sure sure that we seeds more safe and help to stop.
Finally, a solution that is to solve our problems.
Never America. Scover more.
Al Gore: This is the last one.
Video: Comment: It's about reeating energy to America.
One of the fastest ways of bring into the finding dependence from the fuel of the fuel that kills our planet.
Comparsa: The future is here. Vently, sole, a new net.
It's about 2: Novi investment for jobs for a lot of work work for good jobs.
Comment: Repower America. It's time of being realists.
Al Gore: A old proverbio African old hand, "If you want to go through it, you go from the sun.
If you want to go away from them together."
We have to go far away fast.
Thank you very much.
Last year at TED I had a introduction on the LHC.
And I promises of returning to the way you can get it on how the machine.
So I exct. And for the ones that the other time is not -- the LHC is the most big scientific experiment, ever tried -- 27 kilometers of circence.
Her compit is to rear the conditions that were fewer than a billion of second from the beginning of the universe -- until 600 million times a second.
That's all of this is just the environment.
This is the machine in the Gineva.
We Fotographing these min-Big in the reefators.
This is what I work. It's called AS -- it's called AS -- is 44 meters and has a 22 meters and has a 22 meters.
This is an execececular image of AS in building so you can see the projections.
The 10 secember of the last year we have accesor the car for the first time.
And this picture was taken by ATLAS.
It was because of immense in the room in the check of control.
It's a picture of the first of particles that had done all the LHC, ententered into collision, deliberately, with a part of the LHC, and spreading particles inside the reach.
In other words, when we saw that image the 10 secember, we understood that the machine works, which is a great live.
I don't know if it was to do it except us to do more than that, when someone went on on Google and saw that the beginning was this:
That means that we had a cultural impact over the scientific impact of the scientific impact of the scientific impact of the act.
And it was a week later, it was a problem with the machine, we had to have this right here -- these damors.
These files bring 13,000 prints when the car works at the massive of the power.
Now, the technical of you will look at the files and diran, "It's not true. It's not true. I'm film."
And they can do it because when they're very fresh cosident cosident films.
So, at least 271 degrees, at a nurt temperature in the stars, these files can bring that that current in the stellellow of the stellow of the stellellow of the stellellow in the stars, these files can bring that currently in the stellow of the stellow of the stellow of the stellow of the stellellow of the space, in the stellow of the stelles, these files can bring that
In one of the junctures in the LHC, there was a defection of factory fabrication.
So the files are going to be ready, and 13,000 print printed a sudden resistance.
This was the result.
Now, this is even more impressed, if you think these magnetic fishing that these weither than 20 tons in the honto about 30 centimeters.
You have about 50 magnets.
We had to take them to get them to get them to the way.
We have repristined and beach them.
Now they're coming back to their underground place in their place underground.
I get the end of the LHC will be to be new intee in the smart of the mark of the mark of the LHC is going to be new intea.
And we accenderemy, and we expect to get the right data or him, and we continue to get it to find out what the morning is the morning that are the morning that are the universe.
Now, of course, in a certain quick of the way, these accidents reaccending the debate of science and engineering. It's easy to confuting.
I think that the fact that it's so difficult to go beyons, I think this is the valuable of things like LHC.
I want to end up with the words of a Ingl, Humphrey Davy, the gue, image, in defenable experiments of his pupill, and his pupill, he said, "No is a Michael Farady, he said, "No is a lot of the human science, which is a dangerous amount of human scious."
Thank you.
I want to start to start to rethink about how to be baby, you play in the morning.
As you understand how to get them and reach them and make them move them and move them and move them and to the solve problems and solve problems and solve problems and solving problems and space.
The spacecraft reasoning is deeply connected to the way we understand most of the world around us.
So, from the informatic inforce of our interaction with the physical objects with my own own own own physical objects with my own own own own Pac, and my Jeveeven's -- and when we use a computer, instead of having the only one computer, instead of of how to be in a digital computer, instead of wisdo: we can make a gifly drame.
and to get it to our likelilililike?
And the question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer, building the answer, building the Siftable.
In a few words, a Siftable computer is a big computer interactive like a bisco.
In a few words, a Siftable computer is a big computer interactive like a bisco.
You can move with the hands and they can see the handle between them, feeling of their movement and they have a screen and a wireless radio wireless and a wireless radio wireless --
But especially are physical objects like the morning, they can just move to the stick of it.
The Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem to manipulate information.
And as they become more physicists who are conscious about their movement, and as they become more physicists, and as they become more physicists, and as they move them to the way we dive and -- we can explorate new and different stils.
I'm going to start with some simple examples.
This Siftable is configured to show video -- if you include it in a direction, the rooters like that, if you walk from the other side side side the other hand,
These are interactive active argues are conscious of others.
If they are interested in it, they care about what they are going to be done.
If they come to the circums, you can get it and get a little bit.
If they come to the circums, you can get it and get a little bit.
They also have their movement and including their movement and including it.
And then we realized that one of the interesting interesting interesting was the interaction that was the common on data, as if you have a collection of the data, as if it was a colory.
In this case, we have three Sif-fligured like a setches and I can use them to switch them to the color in the central that they mit milit.
and I can use them to switch them to the color in the central color in the central color.
If we go out of it, we can put a little bit of it.
I'm also beautiful, you know, how the languages, like languages, the mathematics and games of logic things that are going to try to do the speed results of the results of the immediately immediately and see the results of the act.
Now I'm --
This is a Fibonacy sequence of Fibonacy program.
Here we have a game game of words that is half of Scarabeo and Boggle.
And in fact, every turning, in every turners on every Siftable, Pratically, every switch every switch on every switch on every Siftable, and while of it compounds on a dictionary.
And then after about 30 seconds are remissed and a new set of letters and new possibility to try to prove and new possibility.
Thank you.
Here is what children came up to the Middle Lab, I did it so that they tried them and I went to a video video.
They are liked a lot.
And one of the interesting things about this is that you don't have to give you a lot of education is that you don't have to give you a lot of educational things.
You just say, "Compons of word," and they know exactly what to do.
That's what other people who try it.
This is our own betterwards, in there on the way on the right right there.
It actually wanted to be switches.
They just were in the morning, for him.
Now, this is an apply of a interactive carton --
We wanted to build a tool, for the learning ling-Lui is Felix.
It can be able to get new characters in the scene, switching the Siftable their associated with it.
It can be able to get new characters in the scene, switching the Siftable their associated with it.
And that's doing the sun of the sun
Video: The sun is surprise.
David Merrill: Now she's brought a treatment in the scene.
Video: The arancient treatment.
Bel job.
So when you go to Siftable and put the neighbors can interact the characters --
Video: Bau!
and it inventing their story.
Video: Ho!
DM: It's a story with open-up and it can decide him how they will.
DM: It's a story with open-up and it can decide him how they will.
Video: Volo, gace.
DM: The last example I have time to show you is a tool, made of recently, to switch and exeguys and exeguing music.
It's a tool, made recently, to switch and exeguing and exeguing music.
The Siftable here are acting on the sounds and bacteria --
Every one of these has four different variations, and you can choose what you use it.
You can get these sounds in a sequence to compose your life.
And to make it just just touch a sounds like a sounds and a "sequence."
These are actually actually you can control from the living and the movie and the movie.
You attacks to a particular sound and then including it to the switches to the stage.
And then there are general effects like time and fly and volume, which are apply to the intersect.
Let's look at how it works.
Video: DM: We're going to start putting a couple of Siftable "sequenc," we can be in a seriously, we add in a seriously, we add in a seriously.
Now I put a bunch line.
Video: DM: Now I add percent of ussion:
Video: DM: And I'm going to put the bacteria, so I can control the living of the living living of the live.
Video: DM: I can speak the entire sequence from a side or from the other.
Video: DM: And I'm going to add the bottom to get more expression.
Video: DM: I can recombining the Red: I can recombining the """Yes."
So I didn't have to plan before, but I can sudden, but I can sudden,
And now, finally, I can sfump the entire sequence of the Siftable Raunt the Siftable "volume."
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is building new new interfaces of man-machine is always more like how our brain works and more like how our brain works and correct.
And today, I had time to show you one of the results of this lost and also some possibilities that we try to bring out from the lab laboratory.
The concept I want to transform is that it's coming to the new generation of objects to interact with digital media that will bring information in our world in the way we want to do with digital media in the way we want to get this new generation of the design of the design of objects that are going to be coming to be in the way we want to get this new generation of the world that we want to transition is that we want to get this new generation of objects in our
Thank you very much.
I don't see the right now of speak to all of you.
I'm a writer.
And I think about books is my professional profession, but it's more than that, of course, of course,
It's also love and the hold and the fall of my life.
And I don't expect that can change.
But that, something that was a particular one of the success was in my life and in my career, which took me to get the entire report, which led me to this work.
The particular thing is I was recently written this book, this biography called "Mangia, Prega, Ama" the quality, and so different from my previous books, for some reason that he made in the world and become a great sailing, ""Mangia, condition."
And the result is that anywhere, people treat people are treated as if I was condanned.
It is true -- condanned a!
They are all worried to me and said, "You don't have a fear of me that you can't do it?
You don't keep keep writing for all the life of life without more to be able to be able to make a book that can be to make a book that can be be able to do that?"
that can matter to someone hon?"
It's rassicurant, you know.
But it could go worse and worse that I remember that more than 20 years ago, when I started to say to people -- I was a training -- I wanted to be a writer.
I would go to the same reaction of the same reaction of the fear.
And people said, "Don't you know, not could you have to have successful?
You don't afford the humiliation of refute kill?
You don't papers to do this mestive for all life without that anything come out and die on a heart of hurt on a heart of swing with the mest-shock of blows to load energy to s?"
So, so you know it.
The answer -- the short response to all these questions is: "Yes."
I am afraid of all of those things.
I always had fear.
And I also have a lot of other things that people can't even even even to be to be in it.
As the becomes and other things she's going to be.
But as it was about how to write what I thought and I was asking me and I asked me the last times' be?
Is it rational?
It's logical that anyone should be waiting for being spent by a work that you feel nicked to do.
But what is that that particular in the imprevented creative to make us nervous health is about the minds of minds in a way that other careers don't do it?
How my father, for example, he was a chemistry and not remember one time in his 40 years of activity where he was asked if he was asked if they were asked if they were afraid to be engineer capit?
It was never -- that block of engineers how to here?
He didn't work like this, right?
Onestly, the chemistry engineers like they didn't have certainly in the seats, and the reputation of being alcolized maniaced by being hood.
We writers have enough this reputation and not only writers but creatives of all generes, we have this reputation of being enormously about.
And it's not going to look at the sad of the magnifies of the magnifies of the magnifies of the magnificent of the twenth of young people and often for them.
And even those who are not suicide seem to be really disappears to their women.
Norman Mailer, before I did, in the last interview said, "Of my book has killed me a little more than a life life in the work of their life.
But we don't dance, when we heard these things like that we heard these things so long, we have completely interiorized and accepted the notion that creativity and suffering are somehow to be somehow to art, and the art, and the art, and the art, and the art, and the art, and then then you get to the end of it, and we have to be in a loved of the things that are all about the way that you know,
And the question I want to bring to all of today, is you agree with this ide?
And it's good to this thing -- because it's looking at the one centimeter of distances -- it doesn't have good for nothing about this suppocking.
I think it's odie.
And I think it's also dangerous and I don't want to see the perpetuated in the next century.
I think it's better to encourage our great minds creative mind.
And I certainly know that in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to start to get that feeling about the constantly of the circumstances where I'm in my career.
Of course, -- -- unsum watch, I have about 40 years.
I have about four decades of work in me.
And it's very likely that everything I write about the time is going to be judged by the world as the work that used after the work that was the last book.
I'm going to slave because we are all more or less friends here -- is likely to my greatest successful is to my shoulder --
Oh, Gesood, which thinking.
You know this is the kind of thinking that brings that a person to start to start bing gone in the morning, and I don't want to do it.
I would just just just go to do this work we do.
So, the question becoming on?
And so I would seeds, after a lot of reflection that the way to work and continue to write is to create a perty psychological costructure, right?
I have to have a few way to find a safety of security -- I am writing, and my natural anxious thing that will be reaction on what it was going to look through the time, trying to find some other societies to see if they could be the best for a lot of better blood and more blood and more blood ideas to see if they could have better ideas and more blood ideas if they could have have the best ideas about how to see if they could have have the best ideas about how to see ideas
how to help people creative to get the people to get the emotional risks of creativity.
And that search led me to the ancient Greek and ancient Roome.
Seguitems because it gives in the circle and then back.
In ancient Greek and antics Rome -- people didn't seem to believe that creativity came to man, OK?
He thought that the creativity was this spirit looks at the wine and who came out of men from a few surprising distant and unknown and unknown -- and unknown away.
The green would call these dams watching the spirits of creativity of creativity --
Socrate, wonderful, he believed to have a demone that will be elargives.
The Romans were of the same idea, but they called that spirit without a genius of spirit with a genius.
And that is great, because the Romans didn't think that a genius was a particular genius was a particular intelligent of a particular artic.
They think that a genius was this kind of divine that created was literally in the muri in the study of a artist, like the Dobby, and who came out of the artick and that came out of the artic, and that came out of the artic.
It is a -- -- -- -- -- -- that is the distance of what I talk -- that was that you know that psychological that protect you from the results of the work.
And they knew that was so that it was so that it works, right?
So the antic artists were protts of things, like for example the too narcises, as for example of the too narcis; right?
If your work was exceptional you couldn't take all the mer, they knew that he was helped by this incorporey.
If your work fail, it was not all of your work -- right?
They knew that was your genius to be a skill.
And so people han concept of creativity in Ocker for a lot of time.
And then the Rinconduction came and everything changed and changed this great ide; we put the human beings and the mysteries and the mysters and without more to let the way of the mysteries that write detail.
This was the principle of the human 2th rational and people started to think that creativity became completely divided by the imidly from the imidation.
And for the first time in history, you started to reference this or article like a kind of like a person with a kind of like a person with a person with a genius.
And I have to tell you, I think it was a big mistake there.
I think allow someone to believe a simple person to believe that being like a recipe of how the sources, the essence and the sisters of all the mysteries of all the divinced and eths is a responsibility to give a very big way to get a very big amount of to give the fragile that human.
It's like to ask someone to save the sun --
It degrees and distores are completely the ego and creates all these ingestiable ings.
And I think it was this pressure to have distructure, in the past.
And if this is true, and I think the issue, the question becoming on?
Can we do it different?
And so that you can go back to a more ancient understanding of the relationship of human relationships and mystery creative understanding.
or maybe not.
Maybe we can't get 500 years of thinking about rational thinking in a 18 minutes.
And you probably have people in the audience that would sushed a scientific suspects on the notion of the nest, you know, you do the next to their projects.
I'm going to probably not going to get all about this thing.
But the question I would like to take is -- why now?
Why don't think about it in this way?
Because it has more sense of any other thing that has ever heard to explain the exhiption of creative process.
And one process that anyone who ever has tried to do something -- therefore, all here -- you know, you don't have rational behavior.
And in fact, it can look completely paranormal.
I did this this recently with the extraordinary poetc. He had now 90 years, but it was a few years but it was a little life and said that in his childhood in the Virginia, and he was working out of the Virginia, and he was going to hear it in the way in the landscape of the landscape from the landscape.
He said that was like a fragorous train air.
And he was coming rotoling to her from the landscape.
He felt to get it, because he was used to get the land below his feet.
He knew that I had one thing to do to do that point and was -- words like a morn."
And so it was coming home and it was coming home and it would not have to get to the other piece of paper, and it wouldn't have to take a piece of paper and a fast enough and the tradition and the staying it on the page.
Sometimes he couldn't be able to be fast and so correct and reach and correct and reach without able to get to the housing roolated and she would go through and she would continued to roll through the landscape, as she said, "another poet."
And then there were -- this piece doesn't forget it -- there were no time -- there were moments where the was almost lost.
So, she was coming home and was looking for card and he was looking for carefully crossed a math in the while she was stying, and then he was a hand then he was like to hold and the off.
He was the coda and the hury of the coda and reput it in his body and turned it in his body and turned it on the page.
And in these houses, the poem would be presented on the perfect page, and intattached but the word at the last word at the first word at the last word at the first word at the first word at the first word at the last word at the time.
So when you hear it -- it's a crazy -- it's exactly the huge, is exactly the huge.
Not all my creative process -- they're not a conducture!
I'm a mult, and my way of work is -- sweet me at the same time and work on and go over and work on and go over and go over and go over the wild:
But even I was in my mind, in my head, I was shirt against that thing, in my time.
And I guess that many of you have.
You know, even if the work and ideas came to me from a certain source of them would not be honestly say.
And what is this thing?
And how can we relate to it in a way to not lose the head, but pluttost, which is it to do it remains sanimal ?
And so I think about it, the best example of the contemporary example I have is the musician and the musician was a few years ago for a journal.
We were talking about this, and you know, Tom, for the most of life was the incarnation of the article of the article of the article of the article of the recreative of the recreatic impulses of creatic impulses of creatic impulses of the totally interior of the life of the reeffort was in the argument of this, and you know,
But then I agreed that, and a day when she was driving on a day and he was driving on a Los Angeles, it changed all for him.
He was going to be fast and all of a melodia, which is in his head of melodia, which comes into his head, which comes into his head, and the wish and wish -- you know, it's wonderful and the desire, but not as a wonderful and the desire, but not as a quick and the desire, but not as it knows how to take it.
It doesn't have a piece of paper, it doesn't have a matter, it has no register.
So it starts to hear this kind of old anxiety groups in him and he said, "I'm going to lose it, and I session, and I sessioned by this lost seseed-of.
I don't have enough and I can't do it."
And instead of go into the stopped here.
I'm going to do the mind, and he did something completely new.
I'll just look at the sky, and he said, "Cusa, not see that I'm driving on the side, not see that I'm driving here?"
"Do you look like it can write a song hone?
If you really want to exist, you get into a more opport, when I can take care of you.
Of course, you go to to get someone else today,
I went to disturbing Leonaring Leonar."
And his work changed and changed after this.
Not the work, the work was still dark as you know, as you were going to be dark as a seed.
But the process, and the fishing range that was released when the genius was released when the genius came from nowere, and he was going to be remaintain the back of where it was happening that didn't have to be a kind of thing and the back.
but he were, wonderful bear, wonderful bizarre a conversation between Tom and this thing that was going to be not Tom.
So how much the story started to change a little bit of the way I was working and already and I had a time.
This idea, saved me when I was writing "Mangia, Ama," and Ama," and a fall of those cave of the disperation where we all all when we are working on something and we can not be able and we start to start thinking that will be a worst book that that will be the worst book ever written written written ever written writed.
Not just bad book.
And I started to think about object.
But then I remember Tom I talk about the air and trials.
So I went to my face on the hands of the hands and directly my comments to a vacuum of the room.
And I said to get out, "things, what you know, both of them are not going to be brilliant not going to be brilliant, right?
Because as you see I'm going to put all of what ho, I don't have any more than that.
So if you want to get your best you have to give you and do your hair.
Okay, but if you don't do it, you know it, I don't know it, I know whatever.
I'm going to go and write the same because it's my work.
And I would like to be a favor that I was today to do my parte," because -- the end is that -- at the end of this is like this, OK -- the end of the North Africa in the North Africa in the North Africa was gone for the dances of the dances and the wild and the wild of the hour and until the albely.
And they were always magnificent because the ballers were professionals, and they were fantastic.
But every tant, I rarely, something happened, and one of these artists became actually transend.
And I know what I know about what I know is that you see everyone, in a certain point, a lost point, a lost point.
It was like the time is stopped and the dances, and the ballery walked through a kind of laptop and was not doing anything like 1,000 nights from the sun, but everything is halling it.
And suddenly not just like a human human being.
But you accepty from divinity in the devulate of divinity.
And when this next time, the time was the time -- people knew what he was was, they called him with his name.
They had the hands and started to cant, "Allah, Allah, God God, Do, God God, God, God God, God, D, God God, Doh, God God, Doh, God God, D, Allah, God God, D, Do, Allah, God God, Do, Allah, God God,
That's God, you know it.
And he was a storic story, when Morderer the Spaper of Spaper was the Spaper was in their own and reading it changed in the centuries of "Allah, Allah, Allah, he still feels in the sous.
In Spaper in Spay has done something impossible and magic and said, "Allah, oh, magnified, "Allah, magnified, that is a -- a last of God.
And it's great, because we need.
But the problem comes the door or for the dance, the while, when you sweke and find that are the 11 in the morning, and the last God of Dr. Ts is not more.
It's just a dead of male with great male to the knee, and maybe it will never be more to get to the switch that altea.
And maybe nobody will be the name of God still while the yet, and what does it have to do with the rest of his live?
It's difficult.
This is one of the most painful reaction to make a creative life in a creative life.
But maybe it doesn't have to be so angohing if you can not believe that, that the most extraordinary aspects of your being being being from you to stessi.
But I just believe that you are data in the prestent of this team of this team of this team of your life that you have to go to somewhere else when you finished.
And you know, if we think in this way change.
And so I started to think about it, and it's sure as I think about it for several months in the work of the book that I will public prestant, the dangerous spect, and I was going to be a very much on my great.
And what I have to keep telling me when I feel electried to this is, not having the fold.
Not just just your work.
It is going to present your hand, whatever it can be.
If your work is dance, it's dance.
If the divine, I was assuming in the divine, and I would take some kind of wonderful for a few kind of wonder, for a only time through your sants --
And I did the same your dance.
And "Oh, it's now!"
I think I think I should be to teach it.
"Yes!" And it's just for the samor for the human beings, and tests argues to take you to put it continuously.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: O!
As you know I've been talking about some of these projects on the human genome on what it can meaning and discovered new genes.
Now we're starting to a new percorrects: we started to digitalize biology and now starting to that digital code is in a new fashion and synthetizing and suspect life.
We always tried to get big questions.
"What is the victim?" is something that many biological biological I think they have tried to understand a levels.
We tried a different approach, reducing to the minimum of the terms of the terms of the terms of the terms of the terms of the terms of the terms of the terms of the terms.
We're digitalizing by almost 20 years ormaes.
When we sequenced the human genome was treated to go from the analogy of biology in the digital world of the digital world of computer.
Now we ask ourselves to the life or to create the new life of this digital universe from this digital universe to this digital universe from this digital universe to this digital universe
This is the map of a small organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, which is the species of genitalium, which is the species of the smaller genome in the lab of the lab in the lab of a small.
And we tried to reduce the genome to create one more small.
We can get a hundred genes of genes about 500 that are here.
But when we take a check to his map on the metabolic map of the nostr.
I think that is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate to the time, is very unlikely that this can bring a living cell of living cells.
So we decided that the only way to progrey was to synthetize this chromosomes to make the components to get the components to get the components to bring some of these questions.
And so we started the bedond the "Can we can synthetic a chromoso?"
Can you feel about making these great molecules that we never had to make these great molecules that we never had to create before you have?
And in case of affermative, can we make a chromosom to work a chromosoma?
A chromosomes is just a piece of chemistry matters.
And the speeds that we are able to digitalize life is growing up to exponential exponential of which we can be remaintainment.
Our ability to write the genetic code, again -- and it is better than slowly, but it's better.
And our most recently, the results are the exponential curve.
We started more than 15 years ago.
And the process has requireed a lot of steals, starting with a bioetic review.
But we found that synthetizing DNA is very difficult.
There are tens of thousands of machines in the world that are small-century of DNA, the longer of 30 to 50 letters to 50 letters to 50 letters to 50 letters of us.
So we had to develop a new method, to assemble these frames and reach the mistake of the mistakes.
And this was our first attempt to start to start to start to the digital information, of the genome of Phi 174.
It's a little virus that kills kills kills kills bacteria kills.
We designed the fragments, effectivated the reeffort and got a molecules of DNA of about about about 5,000 letter letter of about about 5,000 letter letter --
The interesting part is when we took this chemical chemical material and we put it into the bacteria and we put it into the bacteria started reading this genetic and to produce particles and producing the virals.
The virals have released by the cell phone are coming back and they have destroy back and they have destroyed E.
I talked about recent with members of the petrolife's said that they were really really understood that they have certainly comfortable this model.
They have reefs more than you.
We think this is a situation where the software can really build his own hardware in a biologist.
But we wanted to do the larger things.
We wanted to build the entire chromosome.
I'm more than 580 miles miles,
So we thought we built it in the exhibition of virus, so that we can change the saves of virus, so that we can change the viventh of a living cell of a living cell of the living cell of the virus, so we could change the switches.
The projection is crucial, and if we start with digital information, these must be very accurate information.
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 the standard of a mistakes of every 10 miles a remaintain for every 10 miles a remaintain for the first time in 1995 the time.
We found that resequences, 30 mistakes. If we had that original sequence that we had that original sequence would not be able to do it work.
A part of the process is designing segments that are swing for 50 letters that are sovrapping with all other segments of 50 letters lengagers to build underunits that they work together.
We try to get one of them here.
You probably have you probably read that we can get us to the flight.
Think about this is: we have a genetic code on four letters, Actures and T.
To of those readers are all codifice of about 20 love and a specific order to each other hands of reading for every love of reading for every love of bear amminoid of these laws for every love --
So we can use genetic code to write words, fraying, thought, fraying, thoughts.
What we did we have been autography.
Some of them have been dolphushed by the fact that it was not a poem.
We designed these chances to just put them on the leness.
There are enzymes and repair and put them assumption and put them asysyms.
And we started to start with the parts, starting with five to seven miles letter to seven miles letter to be able to be able to form sitgments of 24 miles a way to get 72 miles, and they were to 72 miles.
Anyway, we have produced these sites in the stream, so that we were trying to make it that we're trying to make a very robate procedition -- as you see in a minute.
We're trying to automatize the process.
So, this seems like the tabellon a flower of a flow.
When we get these very longer segments are more than 100 miles -- not growing more directly in the E.
You get to the modern limits of molecule.
So we had considered other mechanisms.
We knew about another mechanism called "recombination called homology, which is useful to repair the DNA to repair the DNA to to be able to unique the DNA to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to reparate DNA --
Here's an example.
This organism, called Deinocock-harbest, it can absorb.
You can see in the submune square the smosome,
In 12 -- 24 hours is reassembled exactly how it was before.
They have thousands of organisms that they can do it.
These organisms can be able to crack it.
They can live under act.
I'm absolutely sure life is in space, and you smooth to find new rich environments who are required to find new rich environments of water.
NASA showed that this is the NASA showed that this happen.
This is a picture of the molecules that we built using these processes just using these procession with the design of the sat at at the sandwim of inseries.
The lightforward the automatically.
This image was not taken with a electronic microscope -- but with a microscope of regulate.
It's a molecule that we can see it with a microscope read.
These are pictures that they cover a period of about six seconds.
This is the published that we did a little time ago.
I'm more than 580,000 letters of genetic code code code code --
It's the biggest molecules that never created by the man.
It has a lot of wear weight in 300 million million.
If we go with a 10 paper with a 10 paper without spaces, they would like 142 pages only to turn this genetic code to get this genetic code.
Now, how do we work work? how can we active?
Of course, you take a virus is a game from girls.
It's a little bit more complicated when they use bacteria up.
It's simpler than when it's eucariote as the ourselves, you can just except the nucleus and put it up on the nucleus and put it up on the way that is basically the process of reached as a way of us.
In the bacteria the chromosome, it's integrated inside the cell but we had recently shown that we can do a complete trailing trailing of a chromosomed cell of a cell of a cell of a cell of a cell and active cell of cell and active.
We purificed a partnership from a microbial species of microbial species of this.
The two are different as the men from topies.
We add some genes more in a way that we can decide what choose for this chromosoon.
And then it took it to the enzymes in the way to kill all the protects of the proteins.
And when we put it in the cell was stupendor -- and you open our degraphic graphic -- the new mosometime is gone in the cell phone.
And we started thinking that we couldn't go old, but we tried to get more in the slower than it is.
This is one of the multimately mechanisms of evolution.
We found that a lot of species have added a second or a third third of a romosome, I add in a second thousands of new tracts of the new tracts of that species.
So who think about evolution as a gene only as a gene gene that you don't understand a lot of biologic bia.
There's an enzymes called "restrictions, is that address are that address of DNA.
The romosomes that was in the cell of the cell is not a one.
The cell pha-the chromosome, we have inserito-tail.
And it turns out that is expressed, and it has recognized the other way that extrane," and we were returning us with only the cell and the new cell and the new romost.
It became the genes because of genes we have inserved.
And in a short lash of time, all the characteristics of a species are lost lost hand, and it turned out of all over a new software that we put in the cell phone.
All the proteins are changed, members have changed, and when we read the genetic code is happening to what we have transfted to you.
Now, this might seem to genetic alchemics, but by altering DNA DNA things in a pretty remarkable way.
Now, I already explained that that you don't talk about genesis -- but progress of progress from three million and a half million years and a half of evolution, and I said that maybe we're going to create a new version of Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosion of this digital process of digital explosion of this digital process of genesplosion of this digital process of C
Why do it that?
I think it's pretty obvious when we think of our needs.
We're going to go from six billion and half billion people in the next 40 years.
Just for an example: I am born in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for each one exist, in 1946; it will be four years, there will be four years, there will be four years, there are three years of there are three people on the planet in 1946; it will be a few years from it.
We're having a problem now to find food, water and clean medicines, medicines, medicines, and damong people.
It will be even more harder to do it for nine billion.
We use more than five billion carbon dioon, more than 30 billion barrels of olight.
That means a million barrels a day.
When we try to find biological processes or whatever these kind of process to replace them is going to be a huge challenge.
And we have to keep on the whole hemission of CO2 from these materials that goes into the atmosphere.
On today, because of the science discoveries that all the world, we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I like to think that are the components of the design design of the future.
The electronic industry is just a dozen of components, and think about how many different things are coming out.
Our limits here are the biological data from reality and from our imagination.
Now we have techniques that because of these rapid rapid fast synthetization, in a way that we call a combinator.
We can build a big robot, which can make a million chromosomes a day.
Think of process, these 20 million genes or to try to get the way to get to get to prove their processes to make either drugs or new vaccines, we can change, because of a little bit more about the last 20 years of science.
And it's just a standard selection selected selection.
We can choose for possibility of surviving, chemistry or of carbon vaccines -- production of glass.
This is a few software programmed of software programmed to be able to be able to be able to sit and design species to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to sign and design species species to be able to be able to be able to be able to be species of software programmed to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
Well, we don't necessarily know how they do.
We know exactly what their genetic code.
Now we're focusing on the carbons of fourth generation.
You see you who are going to extract ethanol was a mouth-hold experiment.
We have carbon on on second and third generation that will be able to be pretty soon as the water water as the water and highest value like either either or different types of throw them --
But the only way biology can have a great impact without increasing more than increasing food and limiting the cost of food and limiting the digging of food and we can get this for which we are working for design cells that can achieve this purpose and we can get this one of the fourth generation in about 18 months.
And the sunlight is a combined methodo-- but in our discoveries in the world, we found different discoveries of the world, we found different different methods.
This is a organism that we have described in 1996.
It lives in the deep ocean to about 2,500 meters of the water temperature of water.
It creates from CO2 using hydrogen molecular hydrogen molecular sources.
We're trying to understand if we can get the CO2, which can easily transportated to be transportated with that CO2 in carbon in carbon on and drive this process.
So we think of a short we could be able to increase what the question of "What is the victims of what the vita" is Noi, veramental -- we have the goal to rewards the petrochemical industry.
Etly. If you can't do it from TED, where you can?
It would be a main source sources.
And so we're working for using the same methods to create vaccines to create vaccines of anei.
You saw this year with the influence, we are always behind a year and a dollar dollar in less when it's going to find the right wine flow.
I think what you can change in a combinable vaccines in antical.
That's how the future could start to look at the future of evolution, accelerate evolution with bacteria -- accelerating the evolution with bacteria and end, and then finally cells and finally cells.
We are so so much from the improving people.
Our purpose is to do it in a long way to try to try and make it very much.
First of all I will show you the fastest as possible, a fundamental work that we have to the Microsoft that we have to the Microsoft in a nearly year ago -- this is Seadrag.
It's a local environment, where you can interact is in the local levels that remote with a huge amount of visual data --
Here we're seeing a lot of gigabyte of digital photos with a kind of zoom and continuous species for a speaker, and I think, for a speakers like we want to do it.
And it doesn't matter how much the amount of information that we see that we see is the big of data or images.
Most is a lot of digital photographs, but this is a properly provided by the Bible library, and reenter in the legal legal legal of 300 megapixel.
It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that the prestations of a system like this is the number of pixels on your screen in any moment. It's also very flexible.
This is a book of data -- example of data not images.
This is Casa desolated of Dickens. Every colonna represents a capitul.
And to show you that this is just about heads and not imagines, we can do something like this, to see really this is a real representation of the head, not of a photo.
It could be a little artificial way to read a little artificial book.
You don't recommend it.
This is a more realistic example of the Guardian.
Every image is the beginning of a selection.
And it gives you really like the light-experience of reading the version of a review of a magazine or a fifth of a fifth of a meeting of a meeting.
We also did something with the corner of this particular particular piece of this particular Guardian.
We created a fasulla advertising advertising -- much more than that you use in a normal publishing -- and we put it in a normal content -- and we put it in the normal content content --
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile, you can see here.
Or other models, or even the specific specific specific wired.
And this really shows some of these ideas to get the limits of space on the screen.
And we hope this gentlemisps to put the pop-up and other doctors are not to be needed to be necessary.
Of course, the map is one of the most obvious aps for this kind of technology.
And I don't want to lose time, if I don't want to say that we have contributed to give it in this field.
These are all the streets in the United States is in the U.S. geoskin.
So now we're going to go to something.
This is actually from the living on the Web -- you can go to see it.
It's a project called Photosynth, which fights two different technologies.
A is Seadragon and the other is a very interesting visual computer that was in Noah Snavely, a student of the University of Washington, with the aid of the Up and Rick Szelii of Microsoft Research. It's a very interesting party.
And it's from the living on the Web and so it was in Seadrage.
You can see it when we do this kind of pattern, where we can go from one and have this kind of thing to be in the other and have this kind of experience.
But the spacecraft collective images here has actually a meaning.
The sleeping of visualization of computer have recorded these images together, so that they have been reacted to the real places. And these things are all the way that you can see the remove to the rorolls -- they were taken on the Montagne Roccian argument of a slide-show of a slidede-show -- you that are all of space.
I don't know if I have to show you some other environment.
There are a lot more spaces.
I want to spend a directly of the Noah's original data -- and this is from a previous pricing of Photosynths that we did work for the first time -- to show what I think is really the key thing is really the key key to show what I think is really the key Photosynth. And it's not necessarily so evident at the environment.
We had to worry about what the legal aspects and so forth.
This is a reconstruction of Notre Dame images previous images from Flickr. Basta Flickr. Basta Flickr in Flickr and you get images of types in the camps, and you get image of these argument are representing a picture that we can be acting to be a pattern.
So they're all images that Flickr and were all connected to this way.
And it's possible to navigate this simple way.
You know, I would never have thought of finish to work for Microsoft.
It's very free to get this kind of acves.
I think you can see that this is a lot of different types of female in the phones in the SLR, a significant number of phone that would have put together in this environment.
And if I can try and find those more stranges.
A lot of them are block to face, etc.
Something here is a series of photographs -- excold.
This is a poster of Notreally, recorded correctly.
We can go from the physics of this environment.
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment. This is now taking data from everyone -- from the whole collective memory of how the Earth, from the point of visual visual visual visual -- and connecting all those data together.
All those pictures become connected together, more than the way of the sum of the parts.
You have a model of the land of the earth of the land of the earth of the earth of the earth of the earth of the land of the earth of the earth of the land that emerges.
Think about this as a proper promotion of Stephen Lawler on the Earth virtual virtual Earth virtual.
It's something that growth in complexity as people are using it, and the advantage that are useful for who are useful with use.
Their pictures are marced with other people.
If you go the idea of contrast all of these sants say the names, my picture of Notre Dame sudral of Notre Dame suddenly resent of all those dates, and I can use how to switch it into this space, in that space, in that space, in that space, and have a social experience.
Of course, a consequence of all of this is extremely elaborated by every interesting part of the earth of the earth -- that doesn't only see from the airplanes and satellitarian images and sitting on the collective memory and satellite images.
Thank you very much.
CA: I realized that you know? What your software going to do is that in a certain point, in the next few years, all of the time of the next few years, all of the way in the world or will be accomplished together?
BAA: Yeah. What is doing is doing is actually discovered.
It's creating hyperlink if you want to get it, in images.
And it's doing it in the content of the images.
And it becomes very interesting if you think about the rich of the seed: that a lot of these images can be hedoned in the way of these images can be really.
As when you do a research of images on the Web and the text on the page of the Web has a lot of information about the picture.
Now, what happens if that picture is connecting all your your fell in your picture?
So the amount of the semantic interconnection and the amount of recichness that is really enormous of it. It's a classic effect.
CA: Blaise, it's really incredible.
BAA: Thank you very much.
One of the pleasure when you travels and one of the hetnographic research is the way that are in who have not forget the antic of the people who have been in the wind, the swing sleeping in the wind wild in the waving of plants.
You know, the one of the Jaguar traveling over over the Vea, or that the Vea, or that the old of the old old of the older of meaningful -- or that in Himalaya, the budrying that in Himalaya, and the idea that the world in which the world in which the world in which which the world in which which the world in which we are not in absolute, but it's just a sense of reality,
the consequence of a particular set of choices adapt that our stirpe has done, in a lot of generations ago.
And, of course, we all share that essentially shared tracts.
We all hidden we all all require.
We are subjects to start action.
We have to deal with the death of death and so we don't surprise and whales --
We all have a art.
What it hits is the particular race of the canzone, the race of every culture.
Not matter that are the Penan forests of Borneo, or the following of the Voodoo of Haiti, or Haiti, the Curanderrids of the Kaith's Curander's Curander's Curander's Curander's Curander's heart.
He was my company in the desert a month ago, or a murt of the walls of the walls of the Mountain the West Mountain the world.
All of these populations teachers are teaching us that there are other ways of thinking about it, other ways of changing in the world.
And if you reflect a time, it's a concept that can give you a hopeful concept that can give you a little bit of a be.
Inside, the mirration of cultures, the world creating a spiritual life and cultural that happening the planet and it's important for the benbe be of the planet and it's important of the planet as a biosphones.
And you can think of this raise as a ethothnosphe and you can call it eetnypher's total sum of all the concepts, which is supposed to be in the kind of perpetrations, intuitions that are being from the imagination of the consciousness of the consciousness of the consciousness of the consciousness of the conflick.
The ethnosfer is the fantastic pathrimoney.
It's the symbol of what we are and what we can be in how it is what we can be in how it is what we can be in how quisities.
And because the biospher's had been quite consumed as much as it was as much as it was as a very rapidly.
No biologist, for example, would say that 50 percent of all the species was or is about the earth of the summer -- in the summer of the most apocalittics -- in the biological diversity field -- and you don't get to the neighbors of the most optimistic -- that of cultural diversity.
The indicates of all of this is, of course, the language of this is obvious as language.
When you're born 6,000 lings, they were born on this planet.
A language is not just a vocabulary vocabulary or from a series of graphical.
A language is the price of human spirit of the human spirit of the spirit of human spirit is the price of the spirit of human spirit is the human spirit of the human spirit is the price of the human spirit of the human spirit of the human spirit of the spirit of the spirit of human spirit is the human spirit of the human spirit of the human spirit is the human spirit of the human spirit of the human
It's the half of which animates of every culture comes in the material world.
Every language is a forest, a s-mind, a thought of a spiritual possibility of spiritual possibilities.
And of those 6,000 langues, as we are sitting in Monterey, at least half of the hold is not more sushed in the ears of kids.
They don't get more teachers to the kids, the who means to not cambely.
What is it more tristers of being haved by silencent, of being the last to talk to a language, of not to get the way of address or of annor or of annow?
This is the state of someone in the state of the world every two weeks every two weeks a few weeks a little bit of a few weeks and a laughter and a language of an ance.
And I know that someone will say, "Is it better than this?
The world would not be a better place if we were all the same language -- then we talk all yoruba. We talk all yoruba. We talk about a month.
We talk about kogi.
You will just take a track, what it means to be able to talk about their language.
I love to do a journey through the ethnos' ethnos' --
a little journey in the ethnospher's above of what we're lost is lost.
A lot of us forget that when I say, "different ways of exist," I really think that when I really have a different ways of exist.
Let's take for example, this moubbbaby in Amazonia in Amazonia -- the popular of anacons, which creates the military of the slate of the sandwim of the sandwest in the sandwips.
It's a population that is not able to distinguish color from the green green because the celeste is hydrogen in the forest, which is identified in the forest, which depends the population of the population.
They have a strange language and a matrimonial rule, he said, "exogamics -- you have to spost a person who is a different language.
And it all has roots in the pastologist, the particularity is that in these extinct family, where they talk about six or seven lings, no one language of the mysters in the mystic main in that they are in the mystic part.
They are just just listen to and then start to speak about.
Let's take one of the most interesting tribes with which I lived -- the Waorans of Ecuador of Ecuador nordal, a population that had the first contact contact in 1958.
In 1957 mission and they had attempt to have a face.
They have made it from the high-photographs that they would get them into a few that they were lovely lovely that this popular forest, they had never seen anything than bi-dimensional bi-dimensional bi-dimensional big.
They have been broken pictures from the ground, they have been to search for a form or a flower or a figar and they killed the diavulous and they killed five mission with the lances.
But Waorans don't kill the stranier's just killed the straniers.
They kill between them.
Five percent of the death was caused to their own people.
We are slow to eight generations and we found two of natural death and when we found two of natural death cases, they lost that one of them was aged that one of them was again that they killed it. And then they killed it. And then they killed it. They had an incredible knowledge of the forest.
The caccidents were able to recognize the animal of 40 steps and recognize that the species.
In the early '80s, I was assigned a really interesting thing when my Harvard professor when my Harvard professor to go to Haiti to me to go to Haiti to the basis of Dualiver and Tonton Macoutes, and you can sessing the velened for the hombie.
To make a sense of miraculation, I would have to understand Vodoun and that Voodoo is not a black hold is black black hold culture and that Voodoo not magic st.
It's pretty a complete metaphicate vision of the world.
Very interesting.
If you ask me to tell me the great religion the world, what would I say to this?
First Islam, Islam, Ebraism, Ebrism, etc.
A continent is always left out of it, thinking that sub-Saharan Africa has no folks of religious religious and Voodoo is that the distilled of these religious religious religious concept of none of these religic concepts in the tragics of the slavery of the slavery is not that the sub-away.
What makes interesting voodoe is the intentered the intentered between life and the death and death.
So the way you saw your spirit.
The spirits can be again from Grande Aqua, they answer to the race of the dance and replaced temporary of the southern the animation of the way that for a short action becomes the die.
So this voodooists, they love to say, "You want to go to kill it to talk about God.
We are dancing in the temple and become God."
And from the moment, you're possing, is the spirit that you guy, how can you do you do?
So you get these incredible events in these incredible events that touch in the state of tracking in the state of tracking a fairly demonstration of the power of the mind of the mind when it was catalyzed in a state of exectruly in a state of explan.
I think that the people with which I have been the most extraordinary Kogi of the Sierra Nevade Santa Marccle in the Colombia was in Santa was in the Colombia was in the Colombia was in the Colombia was in the Colombia was the most extraordinary Kogi is in the most extraordinary of the people who are the most extraordinary Kogi are the Kogi in the Kogi
It was the descending of the ancient of the Colombia in the floating floating on the careers of the Colombia in the conquist, the population was going to be on the vulcanic massive that you get on the career.
In a jarargument of blood this population never been conquented by the spagnot.
And at everyone today are governed by a click but their formation is decided.
The young people following away from the family and four years, and they live in a few years and live in a world of good and shadow and hair to the basic basic for 18 years.
Two terms of nine years of propositions,
And so this time, they get accultured to the values of their society, values that they prehenable their prayers and only their prayers and their prayer -- or to better than to say -- or for the ecological equilibrium --
And Al term of this incredible startation, they suddenly brought up and the first time in the life of 18 years, they see a treatment of consciousness when the sun of the first balls -- when the sun the sun of the beautiful beauty of beautiful landscape is a conference in the conference of the beautiful is a conference in the conference of this is a conference for a little bit behind and says, "You're going to get back and saying,
"Right? I just like I detail.
It's stupend. Now it's protecting to protect it."
They call them the greatest brothers and say that we us, frats are the hospitals of the destruction of the world.
This level of intuition is extremely important.
When we think about the indeed indeed, we invote Rousseau and the old story of the wild of wildy and the old story of the nice or in his simplicity or in his simplicity or maybe we are more neighbors than these people are neighbors to the Earth of us.
The indebed indebed indebed with the nastic feelings from ourselves to the our.
There's no space for these things in the malarian Asmat or the gelies of Tibet, but because of the time and reports, they created a mystics of the Earth -- not on the concept of being aware of the most underlying -- the concept that the most underless: the concept that the Earth can be only in the human consciousness can be in the human consciousness --
What does it mean direct?
It means that a young young man who grows up to grow that the mountain is a spirit that mountain Apu that is going to be a depth of a fun and will have a fun to have a different relationship with the mountain or that place in the Montana who grow of the mountain is a mountain of rock is a cool of rock that is a mountain a rock of rock is a sh.
which is the diath of a spirit or a mineral is irrieving.
What is interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between the individual world and natural world.
I grew up in the forests of the Columbia credent that the forests were going to be cuted.
And that has reefed me to be a different from my friends who believe that the forests are the forest of Hukukukuk and the beyond the wild of paradit and the spirits that live in the world, the wild that in the world, the spirits that are in the Hamats' begin.
If you start to think these culture can be able to create different reality, you can start to start to understand some of their sensations. We take this plant.
I took this picture to open the nordoctor.
Maybe some of you have heard of the ahuase, the most powerful substance of the repertorio of the repertorio of the repertorio of you have heard of the reperty of you have heard of the ahuge.
What makes it fascinating the ayahuas's not the potential that is not the potential for the substance, but his elaboration. It's composed by two elements.
And then a land, this legacy legacy that conties a series of carboline, harmine and harmine moles, and harmly law and moles,
I take the only plant, you have a fugee fuel that alters a little bit of what alters a little bit about the consciously, but it's measured with the shadow of coffee coffee was said Psychotric of the coffee of the coffee.
This plants that triptamines that are very similar to serotonine, a methoxyltryptamine-5, methoxyptamines.
If you ever see the Yanomami tiring on the nose that they do from a different set of species, anch'p," which is a different set of species, ancheck methoxyltryptamine.
Tiring that polar is a little bit like being disappeared by a little bit like being disappears and landing on a smoke of electricity. It doesn't believe a distortion of electricity. It doesn't believe a distortion of the reality of reality.
I was often with my professor, Richard Evan Shultes, the man who sscatended the psychological fungy with his discovery fungaments in the '30 in the '30 in the '30 in Mexico.
I think my text is not to classify these triptaminogens like hallucinogens because if you're done not to tell anyone to be halluck. And then they can't be absorrally because they're dened by a doughly that you find out of the act, because they're denly in the intestimate of the world's mooxy; you know,
It's possible to assule just if you put it on other substances with other substances that dense denses the MAO.
Now is the beauty beta-carbols that are inbests of the MAO, the same kind of necessary for triptamines that are the potential to be able to be able to be able to be able to be 80,000 species of plants, how these people are in the same or of the things that if you look at the sum of the party of the parts?
We use the great eufemisism of proof of the proof of the mistake that can be infrutted.
But if we ask the Indians, they will tell us "Look at the gy."
What does it mean direct?
This tribes, the Cofan, has 17 variety of ayahuas, who distinguish nettely in the forest, and that our eyes would go into the same species.
If we ask how to stabilize their poccken's, they will tell us how to understand the plant, I said, "Those of the rest of them -- I said, "No."
The solution is to take the 17 variety in a night of a pile and each one will be a different hold and each one will be with a different way.
And so this is not laurea to Harvard, but it's a lot more interesting than contare the stams.
Now, the problem is that also the problem is that also the ones that are the people who have to give the indeed people who have to get them in a few way you reduced the marges of the history of the history of the history of the real, and it sleep.
In fact, in the 2X century, 300 years, it will not be reminated for his wars or its innovations that but rather like the way we stopped and we hurt and we hit actively or accepted to the mass of biological diversity and cultural diversity and cultural diversity of biological diversity and cultural diversity of biological diversity and cultural diversity of the planet.
All culture through the centuries have been involved in a dance for new possibilities.
And the problem is not technology.
Indians have not to be smixed to be Sioux when they put from the ark and free as Americans have no walls of being Americans when they put from the hell and warm.
It's not the change or technology that threatening the ethnosfer. It's the power.
The last flight of domination.
And if you give a look at the world, you find that these are not destined cultures.
I grew living creatures and dynamics out of the hydrogen existence that will be beyond their ability to adapt that will be beyond their own skill.
I'm going to be swing in the pathric of Penan:
a navoid nake in the sound of the asiatic -- a population that has lived in the forest, and now reduced the lives of the breaker and reduced the lives of the reefs of the reefs where you can see the flower of the reefs of the Merer's Cinese Marm of the Cinese Merian Meria, where navi the Japanese and the Japanese and the Japanese and in the Japanese --
It takes the stick on the stick with the wook at the forest.
Of course, in the Yanomami, are the disease that have come to the hold of the hold of the bedropping of the hold of the bedroom.
If we move on on the Tibet, where I'm doing a lot of research, where I'm doing a lot of research for politics.
As you know the genocidies, the extension of a population of a popular level, but the instrument of a popular level, but the destruction of life of a popular population, not just condition is not just condent -- because it is a part of the environment, because it is a part of the environment, because it is part of the strategy.
And you can't understand the Tibet of Tibet until you start to start with.
I lost the 6,000 miles from Chengdu in the Western Cina in the Western Tibet southern the South Centland, and just come to Lhasa young line, but only came up with the statistics that we feel like that we feel about it.
6,000 monuments sacred in the poles and cenergy.
1.2 million people killed by military in the Cultural Ritural Rivolution in Cultural.
The father of this guy was ascritical to Panchen Lama.
which means that it was killed to be killed in the Chinese Turch.
The uncle was smowing with Santity in the diaspora that led the popular in Nepal.
Her mother was imprisoned and her hilt was to be real.
It was brought up in the age of two years away, he hidden in his gonna because it wouldn't have to live without him.
The sister, which has done it the same, was in reeducation.
A day he was swarm in a day switched a fashion Mao and this transgression, was brought in the work of seven years.
The Tibet Tibet can be unable, but the spirit of the population is from ten.
And then it turns out, all you reduce a choice.
We want to live in the world's world of monotony or we want to get the policy world of diversity?
The big Margaret Mead, before we dimented in the first of diment, he said that his biggest fear was that in our human view. We don't just see the whole legal legacy of human imagination of human imagination -- but a day we can see a constantly dition of thought, but a day we wake up to a dimentict of thought,
And it's humiliating our species is reminding our species is existed for 600,000 years.
The Neolition, which has given us us to have been given to us to the cult of the seeds, which has done us to the kind of the seeds of the cleration of the classroom, and we talk about 10,000 years ago.
The modern world industryzed has 300 years.
That switch me suggests that we have the answers to all the challenges that we have to deal with a thousand to go to the millenior to come to the millenior to come to the millenies.
When they are in these cultures, you know, the world is asked what to be human, they answer to a different voices.
And it's in these answers that we all risk we all risk of being what we are. It's a kind of aware that you all the people and the gifts of all the people and the giving out of it.
I took this picture on the north of the north of Baff, when I went to the whale of the whale of the Inuit, and this man Olayer, he told me the wonderful story of his grandfather -- he told me the wonderful story of his grandfail.
The dog government was not always gentlemen with the Inuit and in the '50 to stabilize our sounds in colonies.
The grandfather of this man refuted to go to it.
And the family is for his life, he took all the arms, and all of his attempt.
You have to know that Inuit doesn't have the free fresh it to it.
The slack of slicens were made of fishing in the horigin packaged of caribs.
The grandfather of this man didn't put it from the night of arty, or from the basic or from the basis of the flow.
It's sleeped by the hot, you know, panaloned the pages of focus and defected in their hand. When the I did have congelated, their work and they have been congyons.
He switched on the salive of this glass and when they became solid and when I came out, he killed a dog -- he killed a dog -- he killed a dog -- he killed a dog -- he killed a dog --
He brought the dog and created a brief with a brief that has created a slittle, and he sleeped a glass and disappears on the wheel.
We want to talk to the habulous habulous habulous -- this in different ways, [Applausiously is the symbol of the Inuit and all the indeed people in the world.
In the aprise 1999 government canadededese has rejected to the Inuit of a larger territorium of California and Texas mitting together.
It's their new pathria. It's called Nunavut.
It's a sent therefore territories. They know all the resources.
I am plendid, as a national as a national national state can reconcilit with his population.
And finally, I think it's pretty obvious about who we were in these remote areas of us was in these remote areas of the planet, I realized that they are not act.
And so anybody is home.
They open to the human imagination of human imagination that are slow at at the time. And for us everybody, the swimming of these kids, are becoming part of our children, they become part of the hope.
And finally, we have National Geographic we are convinced that politicians will never come to swimming not.
We think that polemicy --
[Applausive, they are not persuasive, but we believe that stories can change the world, and maybe we are the best institution: to tell the stories of the world. Every month our site site to 35 million visites.
156 countries transmitting our television of the C.
Our magazes are lethes from millions of people.
Our work is traveling in the ethnospher's labs in places that are going to be hanging from what they have seen from the way that they saw it, they will be able to be able to be able to be in the central of antithropologi: the world is in the diversity of life in a world of pluralist.
where the wisdom of all the population can contribute to our well-being collective benefit to our well-being accomplished.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some things I wrote in this book that I hope is called other than other than you already heard and I'm going to try to be some linked lining in the case you don't know.
I want to start with what I call "the office."
The official dog's office?
The official dogma of all the Western industry and the real official official and the real benefit to be the benefit to be the benefit to be a lot of the freedodog."
The reason is that it is a late, in the fact that the freedodom is in the same value, is pretable of human beings.
Dad to the other is in the fact that if we are free, each of us can accomplished our benefit for everything that mass our benefit of the but no one of the name of it.
The way to masses the freedodom is to be a choice.
More people people are more free, and more and more and more and more and more and more and more than they wise.
This is so deeply deeply in the society that nobody would have dream to be able to put it in a doubt.
And it's also deeply rooted in our lives.
I'm going to show you some examples of what progress has recome.
This is my supermarket. It's not particularly great.
I lost a simple note on the conditional conditional conditions.
In my supermarket is 175 conditions, without content the 10 variety of extracting and 12 of the balloons that you can buy a lot of conditional whom in the increases in the increasing of the 175 already already reads is of your gradidiment.
That's what the supermarket.
And then you go to the electronic story, to buy a stereo: casses, readers CD, radio, plast, plast, plast, the print.
And in this single story, there's a big hold of electronic components.
We can make six million and a half of different combinations using the components that there are in a negoties.
You have to put that there's a lot of choices.
Some camp: the world of communications.
And once once I was a kid, they could get all the services of wished phones, to the pat that they were forced by mamma Bell.
He was born the phone hand, you don't buy it.
And it was a consequence of that, in the way, was that the telephone is that the telephone is not romous.
These times, they went down.
Now we have a almost illimitated variety of phone phone --
Here are the cell phones of the future.
My favorite is the one in the middle of the hidden of the hidden of the bird and strong the Brush for the Bule.
If you don't even seen it in the sam, you know, you're going to be below you to get it.
And what happens is that people in the negods and this question and it makes this question. And you know what the answer is? The answer is "No."
It's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn't do too much too much things.
So, in other aspects of life that are much more important than the waters of the waters of choices.
Let me existence -- not happens in the United States that you go from the doctor and doctor and doctor what you need to do.
Instead, you go from doctor, and the doctor says, "Oh, you could do A, or B" "He's these benefits and these saves and these saves. What do you want to do you to do that?"
You say, "Does, what would I have to do that?"
And the doctor says, "A has these benefits and these saves, and Bs have these saves, and these saving saving and these risk."
"What do you want to do that?"
And you reble: "Dr. if she was me, what to do to do that?"
And the doctor, "But I'm not leiel."
The result is called the malato," expression that it looks like a beautiful thing.
But it is actually not that one to move the fish, and the responsibility of a decision-doctor of someone who knows somewhat it is doctor, and so it doesn't know -- and so not in the ideal conditions.
There's a huge marketing of drugs of products of drugs and you, if you think you think that if you think you don't have any sense, that we can't buy them.
But if we can't buy them them them because they can you buy them in the audiicize?
The answer is that they want to domer to be the doctor to ask ourselves to change the reject.
And so that is that fundamental as our identity is ever a question of choice, as you see in this vign, "We don't want to be baby. We don't want to be a kids.
And we can reinvented how many times we can get us a lot of cut.
which means that every morning, in the risk -- you have to decide that kind of person is to be able to be there.
And it was the family and the matrimonium of the common action of the common -- that was that there was a little bit of the most preest as we were able to get the most preest as well.
The only one true was with chemicals -- not when you know, and even even what do later.
On the day, it's really really to play it.
I think about a very smart students and I do their 20 percent of work than a time.
And because they are not because they are less diligents.
But why are you imprinting to asked, I would I say, "Where would I have to do it now. I should be doing this right now.
"Would I have to get back later this? I need to think before the kids or career or career?"
I'm interrogative interrogatic interrogatic interrogatis.
And they try to answer these questions, even if this implement doesn't completing the companies that you hold and not get a good vote to my exame.
And they need to really do it. I'm going to do it.
Now, the job: we're lucky, like Carl undertolineavy, because technology allows us to work every single day, from every day, from every day, from every day, from every day, from every single one of the planet, except that the Hotel Randph.
And in parents, there's a corner, and I didn't tell anyone one where the WiFi works.
I don't say to use it because I want to use it.
What is that this incredible freedom of choice that we have about the job? Is it we have to be continuously decided, if we have to work or not.
We can go to see our boy playing with cell phone in a poccket in a poccklackber, and the nicrow on the knee.
And even if they're all shown that we see our boy hil, we also see the part, we are asked, "Do I want to answer this call?"
"I need to answer this email? I have to email? I have to get this literacy ly?
And even when the answer is "no," this makes the experience of the parent of your son was a very different housness of what it would be in other conditions.
So, from any part of the look like small and large and stils and stilts of life, life is a question of choices.
And once the world was this: Ovo, there were some possibility, but not all of a choice.
The world today, it looks like this: The dilemma is "Is it a positive thing, or negative, or negative, or negative, or negative, or negative, or negative,
The answer is the set.
The positive laughing them everyone, so I'm going to talk about the negative of the negative side.
All of this choice behavior two negative effects on the people.
The first one, paradoxy, is that producing paralyside, which is that free is that free.
With so many options between the options that becomes very difficult to do it.
I offer an example of meaningful example of this is a conducted to the plans of flying plant.
A link linked up to the data of Vanguard, the giant company of the foundation of pension, with about a million clients, with about a million companies.
What she found is that for every 10 solutions that are offered in the more, the percentage of extraordinary adedesion.
With 50 sources, there's 10% in less than deaths in less than when they are available to only 5. Why?
Because with 50 sources of whom that choose is maleately difficult to decide and choice is to decide and choice is remaintains.
And I still ask questions, and I think, of course, questions, and of course, the questions is not a making.
You know, it's not just that means that these old jobs from old who are going to be a lot of money to do that decision is so that they lost the decision is so that they lost the fundamental function of the dator of work.
They are not participation, they're losing until 5000-dollar dator of the dator of the dator of the dator of the dator of them --
So the paralysis is a consequence of choices.
And I think that makes the world like this.
"And finally, for the ethry."
You would just take the right decision if it's for the right decision if it's for the ethick, right?
You don't want to choose the wrong source, and you know, the wrong conditions.
So this is the first effect. The second is that if we can avoid paralysis and make a choick, we actually are less sound of how we were being being able to avoid that we were to get to less options of what they chook.
And this for several reasons.
One of these is that with a lot of conditions that are going to take a different and it's not perfect -- it's easy to imagine that you could have have to be better than you could have been better to imagine that you could have been better than alternative imagined us to induce the way of choices, and the remouse the satic sfrums, and the remale sfaved by the decision of the decision that you can be be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to make a chapplant.
even when it was a good decision.
More choices are easy to be easy to any details that is unsoddisfacing of choices.
And so that is what economists call it cost-opportunity.
Dan Gilberbert has very well staming to the words that we go to the things that we lost that we confronti.
Del rest, when there are so many options as options as it is easy to represent the alternative characteristics of alternative that you can be less soddisdisappears of option.
Here's an example. I switch with all those who are not in New York.
But it's probably what you probably think about it.
There's this copy in Hamptons.
A place of slow.
It splendid. Ottima newspaded. It's all about them.
Not anything. But what he thinks is "Well, maledition, is Agoit."
"All my neighbors in Manhattan is alive.
"I could park right at the hous."
And it spent two weeks that is perspective, which is perting -- every day -- the possibility of parking where you want.
The cost of the diminute opportunity to what we have, even when the choice was excellent -- when the choice was excellent.
And the most of the options that we have to consider -- more than the characteristics are coming back against opportunity.
Here's another example.
This is a lot of things.
It talks about the time and perhaps of living slowly.
But the most important point is that whatever you can choose to not do anything.
The things that we don't choose have a lot of attractive active that can make less attempt what we do.
Third point, spiral growing of the waites.
I tried to my skins bought a new of jeans.
And I'm nearly going to be jeans.
And once the jeans were just a few days were in the jeans and west them and west, they were smoked, only after they had a life and work a lot of times, they started to go well.
So, I went to buy a couple of jeans, when the old who were gone and said, "I'm going to have a couple of jeans, this is my cut."
And the committed was said, "Li wants slim fit, fit, fit, fit, and fit?"
Do you want to the cernier's or with the bottonies? "Hed" or "acid" or "acid" or "hed" or "hed" or "hed" or "hed" or "acid."
"Hoes wants to hook on it.
"Well it wants or close? Bl, you know, the blah -- Continuy was in the belencar.
I was sways, and after a little bit of I was able to say, "I want the kind of -- which was the only one typo" -- that was just a little bit of what I had to do in the jeans, then then went out of negotitil, and then I went out of the negotititime."
It was the massive house. With all that I had got the bet.
But I felt worse.
Why? I wrote a book to understand it.
The reason I was worse is that I was worse with all that choice the time my expectations were altises.
And I was expectations at the beginning to me. I didn't expect to anything that was exceptions, when I live 100 different accidents, at least one of the same time, at least one of the same time.
What I had watched was good -- but not perfect it.
After I was talking about what I was trying to do with what I was trying to do with what I was trying to expect.
The add of options in the life of people don't do that get the expectations that these are respect to the options of the options itself.
And this will proping less soddisfation, even when the results are good for it.
No one in the world of marketing if it makes it content.
Because if you know that I am not knowing what I'm talking about.
The truth looks more like this.
"You know, when you were worse when you were worse when you were worse when you were worse when you were worse to the worst was still to meet with the surprise pleasure.
On the day, in the world we live -- opululationalized citizens with the perfeation of the perfair, the mouths that we can hope is that things are at the attaction of the waitative expectations.
You never have been surprise because you pleasant because your expectations, and I expectations, and they were ingiant ingiant for you.
The secret of happiness -- what you're here -- is "Basyes, "Yeah, you want to be in the wisdo."
I mean, I am -- little bit of a career -- which is really smarried and my wife is really stums.
I couldn't do better, I didn't have to do it, I don't have to do better.
But you get it doesn't always be bad thing.
And finally, a consequence of the jeans smoods when there's only that jeans is that when you have just that jeans is that when you're not satis;
"Who is responsible, the answer is clear.
The world is responsible. What I could do about this?
When there are hundreds of jeans, and you buy a insoddisface, and you ask you who is responsible for you who are responsible for you to it.
You could do better.
With hundreds of variety of avavavailable variety of available and for the insuccess.
So when people take decisions, even if the result is valized, they feel insodden and they give the same.
In the last few years the depression is exploded in the industrialized.
I think a significant factor -- not the unique -- not the unique -- of this honor depression is just that people have deludent experiences because the standard are too alone.
And when they need to explain this situation that the colpes is them.
So the end result is that in general is that in general are better.
Let me remember you.
This is the offical, what we all take for good and it's completely fail.
There's no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than you don't have any long, but it doesn't have a lot of choice is better than a little bit of a little bit better than a little bit.
There's a critical value, magic value. I don't know what it is.
But I'm sure we have been over, by a piece of the level where the choices better.
Now, from political point of political point -- I almost ended -- from the policy point of policy is the follow.
What it allows all this choice in industry is the material reef.
There are a lot of places in the world, and you know about it, where the problem is not that they have too much choices.
The problem is they have too much of it.
So the way I'm talking about is a malt of modern -- which I'm talking about is mallow of moderns, which society society that society society in it.
And what it dots and array is this: Steve Levitt talked about how much the cost and those who are constoks and swing seats are inutilized. It's a money. It's a money.
I mean, these complicated choices, and dispendioses, is not that they are just ineat.
I'm deleting with deleteries.
They do worse in the worst one.
If you have a little bit of what in our society is allowed to be reverted in those where people have too much of the people who have too much of their life and also also the noway to be better but the noway.
This is what economists call a better better paretyar.
A redistributions of rewards of rewards -- not only to the poor -- because of this choice in except for us to get us down.
To wrad: "Foom it, you can become the way of --
Voes, people of culture, thought, "But what makes that fish, what makes that fish,
"It's obvious that you can't make anything in a vetrow of wetrote w."
"A imagination of fally" -- a limited vision of the world."
and I was in the beginning of this this is the beginning of this in the beginning.
But then, I realized that that weight the sweep, I realized that that fish fish.
Because the reality of fact is that if you sent the mous, so that they can be able to be able to be able to be freedom.
If you rose the satic way that everything becomes possible to diminual soddisfation.
You get the paralyes, and you reduce the well-being.
They all need a sfer.
This is almost certainly too stret, maybe even for fish, maybe even for us.
But the absence of some symbolic symbolic for infelicity and temo, for the rovine.
Thank you very much.
