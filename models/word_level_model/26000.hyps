<unk> year I showed these <unk> <unk> that the <unk> <unk> <unk>, which for almost three million years had the size of the United States <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
I <unk> this <unk> the <unk> of the problem because it doesn't show the <unk> of the ice.
<unk> <unk> is, in a way, the <unk> <unk> of the global climate system.
It's <unk> and <unk> in summer.
The next <unk> will be a <unk> <unk> <unk> in the last 25 years.
<unk> <unk> are <unk> in red.
You see, you're <unk> to the blue <unk>.
That's the ice in <unk>, which is <unk> summer.
You can see that the <unk> ice <unk> <unk>, of five years or more, is like blood here, which here is <unk> from the body.
In 25 years it was so, so.
This is a problem because the <unk> is <unk> the <unk> <unk> around the ocean <unk> where there are huge <unk> of <unk> that, <unk>, <unk>, are <unk> in <unk> from <unk>.
<unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk>, that <unk> could <unk>, <unk> this point of not <unk>.
In some <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is already <unk> from water.
The <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> has been <unk> with a team <unk> <unk> last <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>! <unk>: <unk>. <unk>: You're fine. The question is if you <unk>.
And one reason is that this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from the north.
This is a river in <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> had never <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This is the <unk> <unk>, in the <unk> of <unk>.
If you want to know how the <unk> is <unk> <unk> <unk> on <unk>, you're going to know how the sea level of <unk> here, is where the sea.
These <unk> are <unk>.
On the other side of the planet: <unk>, the largest <unk> of ice on the planet.
<unk> month scientists have <unk> that the <unk> of the ice is in <unk>, and that <unk> in the <unk>, which is particularly <unk> in <unk>.
<unk> at six feet of level of <unk>, like in <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, the third largest <unk> of ice, you see new <unk>, which a few years ago, they were <unk>.
40 percent of the world's population <unk> water's <unk> by that <unk>.
<unk> <unk>: this <unk> is the source of water <unk> of this city.
The <unk> is <unk>.
But when you <unk>, the same happens to the <unk> water.
It's <unk> on the <unk> <unk> 40 percent.
<unk> <unk> are in crisis.
<unk>, as you read, are <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> in the world <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> are <unk> to a <unk> out of the normal, and not <unk>.
Sometimes, over the last 30 years than the <unk> <unk>.
This is a <unk> of the whole <unk>.
If you look in the context of the <unk> can see the <unk>.
In the last five years, we've <unk> 70 million <unk> in the last five years, we've <unk> 70 million <unk> in the oceans every day.
Look at the area of the <unk> <unk>, from <unk>, to <unk>, and on both parts of the <unk> <unk>, where there's a <unk> <unk> of oxygen in the ocean.
The largest cause of global warming, together, which is 20 percent, is the use of <unk> <unk>.
<unk> is a problem, and <unk> is even worse.
The United States is one of the two countries with <unk>, with China.
And you're going to build a lot of other <unk> <unk>.
But we're <unk> to a <unk> of the direction.
These are the <unk> projects over the last years and some <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
There's a political <unk> in our country.
<unk> <unk> and oil <unk> <unk> <unk> million dollars in the last year to <unk> <unk>, which is a <unk>.
And I <unk> up something --
<unk> <unk>, in <unk>, where I live, there was a <unk> of <unk> billion <unk> of <unk>.
You may have seen it on the <unk>.
This is the largest flow of <unk> in America.
It's happened around <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> of one of the <unk> <unk> was this.
<unk>: <unk>, <unk> <unk> is a <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
It's <unk> here in America, and it's going to grow our economy.
<unk> <unk> is more <unk>.
It's <unk>, <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Al <unk>: From this, it's a lot of <unk> <unk>.
The largest <unk> society on the <unk> is <unk> <unk>. This is <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> <unk>: <unk> clear -- Al <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> -- they don't know what they're talking about.
Al <unk>: So the <unk> for the <unk> of <unk> has <unk> two <unk>.
This is one of them, one part.
<unk>: <unk>: At <unk>, we see the <unk> changes as a <unk> <unk>.
That's why our <unk> is <unk> a lot of money in a <unk> <unk> to make public and <unk> truth in <unk>.
Actually, <unk> is not <unk>.
We think it's <unk> -- it also has a good <unk>.
So we don't know about climate change.
We want to do it.
<unk>: <unk> <unk> -- you've heard a lot of it.
So we <unk> a <unk> structure to the <unk> <unk> for <unk>.
<unk>! <unk>. <unk> are a little <unk>, but this is the sound of the <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> is between the major <unk> of global <unk>, but <unk> technology <unk> that you see changes everything.
Let's look: this is <unk> technology <unk>.
Al <unk>: <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk> to the economic issue and the national security.
<unk>: <unk> is in the crisis; the <unk>, national security, the national <unk> crisis.
The <unk> that <unk> all: our <unk> <unk> from <unk> <unk>, like <unk> and oil <unk>.
Now, though, there's a new, <unk> solution to <unk>.
<unk> America: 100 percent of <unk> energy in 10 years.
A plan to <unk> America at work, <unk> more <unk>, and help <unk> global warming.
<unk>, a solution that is <unk> to solve our problems.
<unk> America. <unk> more.
Al <unk>: This is the last one.
<unk>: That's about <unk> energy to America.
One of the most <unk> ways of <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> our planet.
<unk>: The future is here. <unk>, sun, a new network <unk>.
<unk> <unk> 2: <unk> <unk> for <unk> jobs.
<unk>: <unk> America. It's time to be <unk>.
Al <unk>: A old <unk> <unk> <unk> says, "If you want to go, you go for yourself.
If you want to go far, you go together. "
We need to go far, quickly.
Thank you very much.
I did, I did an <unk> on <unk>.
And I'm going to try to <unk> how the car works.
So here we go. And for those who was not there, <unk> is the largest scientific experiment ever <unk> -- <unk> miles of <unk>.
His task is to <unk> the conditions that were in less than a <unk> of the universe, from the beginning of the universe -- all the way to <unk> million times a second.
That's just <unk>.
This is the <unk> machine.
They <unk> these <unk> <unk> into the <unk>.
This is what I work on. It's called <unk> -- it's <unk> <unk> feet and it's <unk> feet.
This is a <unk> image of <unk> in <unk> in <unk>, so you can see <unk>.
<unk> <unk> last year, we <unk> the car for the first time.
And this picture was taken by <unk>.
It was because of <unk> <unk> in control.
It's an image of the first <unk> of particles that had all done the <unk>, <unk> in <unk>, <unk>, with a part of the <unk>, and <unk> particles inside the <unk>.
In other words, when you get that picture the 10 <unk>, I think the <unk> <unk> machine, which is a great <unk>.
I don't know if it was to <unk> us to <unk> more or that, when somebody <unk> on Google and I knew the page <unk>, it was this.
That means that we've had a <unk> impact over to that scientific impact.
And I was a <unk> after a week, we had a problem with the car, we had to do this <unk> here -- these <unk> <unk>.
These <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> when the car works in the <unk> of <unk>.
Now, the <unk> between you are going to be <unk> and <unk>, "It's not true. I'm too <unk>."
And instead they can do it because when they're very <unk> to become <unk> <unk>.
So, at least, <unk> degrees, at the <unk> temperature <unk> to the <unk> of the space between stars, these <unk> can bring that <unk>.
In one of the <unk> between the most <unk> <unk> in <unk>, there was a <unk> <unk>.
So the <unk> <unk>, and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
That was the <unk>.
Now, this is even more <unk> if you think of these <unk> <unk> over 20 <unk>, and that <unk> about 30 <unk>.
They <unk> about 50 <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, what we did we do.
We <unk> them and <unk>.
They're all <unk> to their <unk> place.
<unk> the end of <unk> the <unk> is going to be again.
We <unk> it, and we try to get the data to <unk> or <unk>, and continue so our <unk> to figure out what the <unk> are <unk> that <unk> the universe.
Now, of course, in a way, these <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> of science and engineering engineering of <unk>. It's easy to <unk>.
I think the fact that it's so hard, the fact that it's so hard to go beyond the <unk>, I think it's the value of things like <unk>.
I'd like to end with the words of a <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, who, <unk> <unk>, in <unk> of the <unk> experiments of his <unk> was Michael <unk>, said, "It's not so <unk> for <unk> progress of the human mind, how <unk> that the <unk> that the ideas of science are <unk>, that there are no new <unk> <unk>.
Thank you.
I want to start <unk> <unk> to when, from children, <unk> <unk>.
As I was <unk> like <unk> and <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, <unk>, I actually think about and <unk> problems <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> to the way that we <unk> most of the world around us.
So, as a <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of our <unk> with objects with <unk> objects, together with my <unk> <unk>, and my <unk> <unk> <unk>, I started <unk>, I started <unk> to say, "And if, when we use a computer, instead of having the <unk> <unk> <unk> as a digital, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> an information <unk> with <unk>,
and <unk> to our <unk>?
The question was so interesting that I decided to try to explore the answer, building <unk>.
In a few words, a <unk> is a computer <unk> big as a <unk>.
In a few words, a <unk> is a computer <unk> big as a <unk>.
You can <unk> them with your hand, you can <unk> their <unk>, feel their movement and have a screen and a <unk>.
But <unk>, they're <unk> objects, like <unk>, you can just <unk>.
<unk> are the example of a new new tools to <unk> information to <unk> digital information.
And as they become more <unk>, <unk> of their movement, other, and they become more <unk>, <unk> of the <unk>, <unk> of <unk>, <unk> of <unk>, we can explore new and <unk> <unk> <unk>.
I'll start with some simple example.
This <unk> is <unk> to show you about video: if you put it in a direction, the <unk> <unk>, so if you put it in a direction, you'll get back.
These <unk> <unk> are <unk> of others.
If you <unk> them, you start to what they're going to be around.
If they're <unk>, they can <unk> it up, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, and you can <unk> it up.
If they're <unk>, they can <unk> it up, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, and you can <unk> it up.
They also <unk> their movement and <unk>.
We have <unk> that one of the interesting <unk> of the <unk> was that we could use common <unk> on data, for example, in a <unk> color like a <unk>.
In this case, we have three <unk> <unk> as a <unk> <unk>, and I can <unk> to <unk> <unk> for <unk>.
and I can <unk> to <unk> the color in the middle of the central one where you're <unk>.
If we <unk>, we can <unk> a little bit of place.
There are also <unk> possibilities of <unk>, like <unk>, <unk>, mathematics and games where people can <unk> things, and <unk> <unk> where people can <unk> things, and <unk> the <unk> immediately.
Now I'm --
This is a <unk> sequence of <unk> that I do with a <unk> program.
Here we have a word word that's <unk> <unk> and <unk>.
<unk>, at all, I had a letter to <unk> on every <unk>, <unk>, every <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and as I was <unk> to <unk> words, he <unk> on a <unk>.
Then, after about 30 seconds you <unk>, and you have a new <unk> of <unk> and new <unk> to try.
Thank you.
Here we have some <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk>, I did so that I <unk> them, and I <unk> a video.
They're very much.
And one of the interesting things of <unk> is that you don't have to give people many <unk>.
I just say, "<unk> of words," and they know what to do.
Here we are other people who <unk> it.
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
It actually wanted to <unk>.
They were just <unk>, for him.
Now, this is a <unk> of a <unk> <unk>.
You could build a <unk> for the <unk> of <unk>. He's <unk>.
It can <unk> new characters in the scene, <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It can <unk> new characters in the scene, <unk> <unk> <unk>.
So, he's <unk> the sun.
<unk>: The Sun is <unk>.
David <unk>: Now he's got a <unk> in the scene.
<unk>: The <unk> <unk>.
<unk> work! Yeah!
So, <unk>, <unk> <unk> can <unk> the characters --
<unk>: <unk>.
-- <unk> your story.
<unk>: <unk>.
<unk>: It's a story with the final open, and it can decide how it <unk>.
<unk>: It's a story with the final open, and it can decide how it <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> away, <unk>.
<unk>: The last example I have time to show you is a tool, made of recently, to <unk> and <unk> music.
is a <unk>, made recently, to <unk> and <unk> music.
The <unk> here are <unk> by <unk> as a <unk>, low, <unk>.
<unk> of these four different <unk>, and you can choose what to use.
You can also <unk> these <unk> in a <unk> sequence of <unk>.
And we just <unk> by making a <unk> sound and a sequence.
These are the effects that you can control of live, like <unk> and <unk>.
I <unk> it to a particular sound and then <unk> to <unk>.
And then there are the <unk> effects of time and <unk>, <unk>, <unk> to the entire sequence.
It's going to do how it works.
<unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> a <unk> in two <unk> sequence, <unk> <unk> into a series, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
Now, let's take a <unk> line.
<unk>: <unk>: Now I <unk> <unk> --
<unk>: <unk>: And now I'm going to <unk> <unk>, so I can control the <unk> of live.
<unk>: <unk>: I can <unk> the entire <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> the <unk> or the other.
<unk>: <unk>: And now we're going to <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> to the flight.
So I don't have to <unk> before, but I can <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
And now, finally, I can <unk> the entire <unk> sequence on the left <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is to build new <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to how our brain works.
And today, I've had time to show you one of the results of this path, and also <unk> to <unk> out of the lab.
The concept I want to <unk> is that's going to <unk> this new generation of <unk> objects to <unk> with media, which is <unk> information in our world in the way that we want.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the time I'm going to talk to you.
I'm a <unk>.
<unk> books is my <unk>, but it's more than that, of course.
It's also love and the <unk> of my life.
And I don't look like that it can change.
But, I said this, something that is happened in my life and in my career, which has led me to <unk> the whole relationship with this work.
And the particular thing is I <unk> wrote this book, this <unk> called "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
And the result is that it <unk> now, people <unk> me as if I was <unk>.
<unk> -- <unk>, <unk>.
I'm going to <unk> me and say, "You don't fear to be able to do it more than to do that?
You didn't fear to write all the <unk> for life without being able to make a book that could <unk> to someone? "
<unk> that somebody could <unk>? "
It's <unk>, you know.
But it could be worse, except for me, except for 20 years ago, when I started to say to people -- I wanted to be a <unk>.
I <unk> the same <unk> <unk> from fear.
And people say, "You don't <unk> you didn't know you could be successful?
You're not afraid the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> you?
You're not afraid to do this <unk> for all life without any <unk> <unk> <unk>? "
So, you know.
The short answer to -- the short answer to all these questions is, "Yes."
Yeah, I'm afraid of all those things.
I've always had fear.
And I also fear of many other things that people couldn't <unk>.
As <unk> and other things are <unk>.
But, I'm about writing, I thought, and <unk> me is why?
Is that <unk>?
It's <unk> that anybody who <unk> <unk> <unk> to be <unk> by a job that you feel used to do.
But what is there so that particular in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> about health care about health care in a way that other <unk> do not?
How would my father, for example, he was a <unk> <unk>, and I didn't remember one time in his 40 years of activity where asked asked them if they were to be <unk> <unk>?
We never had -- that <unk> of <unk> John, how do that?
You don't <unk> that, you know?
<unk>, engineers as a group, as a group, in <unk>, <unk>, <unk> the <unk> of being <unk> <unk>.
We <unk>, we have enough this <unk>, and not just <unk>, but <unk> of all kinds, we have this <unk> to be <unk> <unk>.
And I didn't know, you know, looking at the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that only in the <unk> century, <unk> young and often for them.
And the ones that don't <unk> seem to be really <unk> by their <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, before you die in the last <unk> said, "Every book has <unk> me a little bit more." And I <unk> about the work of their own life.
But we didn't know when we <unk> it because we've heard these things so long that somehow we have completely <unk> and <unk> the <unk> that creativity and <unk> are <unk> that you know that creativity and <unk> are <unk>, and <unk>, <unk>.
And the question I want to <unk> all here to you all this this idea?
It's good for this -- because it also <unk> by a <unk> away to me, it's not good for this <unk>.
I think that's <unk>.
And I think it's also <unk>, and I don't want to <unk> <unk> in the next century.
I think it's better <unk> our great <unk> <unk> to live.
And I certainly know that, in my case -- in my case -- it would be very <unk> to begin to that <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in which I'm going to <unk> <unk> in my career.
<unk> -- <unk>, you look at it's quite young, I have about 40 years.
I still have four <unk> <unk> in me.
And it's very <unk> that anything will happen now in then, you're going to be <unk> from the world like the work that after the last <unk> of my last book.
I'm going to say, because we're all or less friends here -- is <unk> that my greatest success is to my <unk>.
Oh, <unk>, that thinking.
You know, this is the kind of thought that leads to a person to <unk> <unk> at nine at <unk> <unk>, and I don't want to.
I want to continue doing this work that I love.
So, the question becomes, how?
And so I think, after many <unk>, that the way that I work to do is to create a <unk> <unk> <unk>, OK?
I have to get a distance to security between me, which I'm <unk>, and my natural <unk> to <unk> on what's written about <unk>. And as I was <unk> for the last year models of how we start to do that, you start looking through the time, looking for other society to see if you want more than having better ideas, and I have better ideas,
about how to help people <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity.
And that research has led me to the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
I'm going to <unk> because I went back and then <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> -- people don't believe that creativity <unk> creativity from men, OK?
And he thought that creativity was this <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> to men from some <unk> <unk> and <unk>, for <unk> reasons and <unk>.
<unk> <unk> these <unk> <unk> of <unk> creativity.
<unk>, <unk>, I decided to have a <unk> that <unk> <unk> from far.
The <unk> were the same idea, but they were <unk> the kind of spirit without a <unk>.
which is <unk>, because the <unk> didn't really know that a <unk> was somebody particularly.
I thought that a <unk> was this sort of <unk> <unk> that <unk> literally in the <unk> study of a artist, a little bit like <unk>, and <unk> out of <unk> <unk>, and <unk> out of <unk> <unk> <unk> of that artist and <unk> the work out of that.
<unk> <unk> <unk>.
And everyone thought that was so that they were <unk>, right?
So, artists were <unk> by <unk> things, like the too <unk>, you know, right?
If your work was not <unk>, you didn't <unk> <unk>, you're not going to be <unk> by this <unk> <unk>.
If your <unk> work, it was not <unk>, you're not <unk>, you know?
You all know that was your <unk> to be a <unk>.
And so people are going to <unk> creativity in <unk> for a long time.
And then the <unk> <unk> and <unk> this great idea; we <unk> this great idea; we put the human being around the universe over the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> space and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> space and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> space and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> space to the center and <unk> and <unk>
This was the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and people thought about thinking that creativity was <unk> from <unk>.
And for the first time in history, <unk> to <unk> to this or that artist as a rather <unk> <unk> to one person, rather than one person with <unk>.
And I have to <unk>, I think it was a big <unk>.
I think of somebody, a simple person to believe that that being like a <unk> like the source, <unk> and <unk> of all <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> and <unk> and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, a <unk>, a <unk> person, <unk> to <unk> human <unk>.
It's like to someone to <unk> the sun.
<unk> and <unk> and <unk> all these <unk> and creates all these <unk> <unk> on the <unk>.
And I think it was this to have been <unk> artists in <unk> 500 years.
And if that's true, and I think that's true, and the question is, and now?
Can we do it?
We want to go back to a <unk> understanding between humans and <unk> <unk>.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we can't <unk> 500 years of thinking about <unk> in a <unk> talk.
And there are probably people in the audience who <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on their <unk>, <unk>, you know, you know, people <unk> <unk> <unk> about their projects.
You probably don't <unk> about this thing.
But the question I want to ask is, why not?
Why don't we <unk> it like this?
Because it makes more than anything else I've ever heard to explain <unk> <unk> of the <unk> process.
A process that, as anyone who has ever <unk> to do something -- so, everybody here -- knows, you don't <unk>.
And in fact, it can sometimes be completely <unk>.
I did this <unk> <unk> with the extraordinary <unk> <unk>, which has now 90 years now, but that was a <unk> for all life and said to me that during his <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> out in the <unk>, <unk> <unk> out in the <unk>, and <unk> him, within me, when a <unk> <unk> from <unk>.
And he said, it was like a <unk> <unk> of air.
And that <unk> towards her from <unk>.
I <unk> him to him, because he was <unk> the earth under his feet.
I was going to do one thing to do to do at that point and was, words, "<unk> like a <unk>."
And so he went to home and he was <unk> by this <unk>, and he didn't have to take a piece of paper and a <unk> enough enough to be <unk>, <unk> and <unk> on the page.
Sometimes, she couldn't be quite fast, so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> without being able to get home to <unk> and she would <unk> her to <unk> through the <unk>, looking, and she would <unk> <unk> through the <unk>, looking, as she said, "another <unk>."
And there were those times -- this piece never <unk> -- there were moments that -- there were moments when the <unk> was almost <unk>, OK?
So, he was <unk> at home and was looking for paper and <unk> the <unk> through, and he <unk> a <unk> in the right <unk>, and she was like, and then said, that it was like he <unk> with the other hand and <unk>.
<unk> the <unk> from the tail and the <unk> in her body and the <unk> on the page.
And in these cases, the <unk> would be <unk> on the <unk> page, but <unk>, on the last word to the first.
So when you get it -- it's <unk>, it's exactly <unk> to my <unk> process.
Not all my <unk> process -- I'm not a <unk>.
I'm a <unk>, and my way of <unk> is <unk>, <unk> at the same <unk> every day and <unk> to work on top of it.
But even me in my <unk>, I've <unk> against that, sometimes.
And I think that many of you as well as.
You know, even though the work and ideas, I <unk> from a certain source, I couldn't <unk> <unk>.
And what is this thing?
And how do we <unk> it so that we don't have your head, but rather, that <unk> us?
As I'm, the best example, I have <unk> <unk> <unk>, which I've been <unk> <unk> different years ago for a <unk>.
I was talking about this, and you know, <unk>, for the <unk> of life was the <unk> of the <unk> artist <unk> <unk>, trying to control, <unk>, <unk> these species of <unk> completely <unk>.
But then <unk>, he was <unk>, and one day as he was <unk> on a <unk> <unk>, he <unk> everything.
I <unk> <unk> up, and all of a <unk> <unk> this little <unk> of <unk>, that comes into his head as <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, and <unk>, and she wants, you know, it's wonderful, and the <unk>, but she doesn't know how to <unk>.
It's not a paper of it's not not a <unk>, it's not <unk>.
So you start to feel this sort of old <unk> <unk> species that we grow in him like, "I'm going to lose, and I'm going to <unk> this <unk> song.
I'm not enough <unk>, and I can't <unk>. "
And instead of going to <unk>, you're <unk>.
He <unk> the whole <unk> process and made something completely new.
I just <unk> the sky and said, "<unk>, you don't see I'm <unk>?"
"<unk> you feel that you can write a song now?"
If you really want to <unk>, you'll be <unk> at a <unk> moment when I can take care of you.
<unk>, <unk> to <unk> else today.
I started <unk> <unk>. "
And his <unk> process, <unk> after that.
Not the work, it was still <unk> as always.
But the process, and the <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> was <unk> when they <unk> the <unk>, the <unk> that out of him, the <unk> that out of this, <unk> that <unk> would be <unk>.
but it was <unk> this, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a conversation between <unk> and this <unk> thing that's <unk> and <unk>, but it wasn't <unk>.
So, how much <unk> <unk> to change a little bit of how I <unk> and I <unk> and I've already <unk>.
This idea, I was when I was <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and I <unk> into one of those <unk> of the <unk> that we all work on something, and we can start thinking that's going to be a <unk>, which is going to be the <unk>.
Not just <unk>, just <unk>, the book wrote.
And I started thinking about <unk> this project.
But then I <unk> to <unk> that <unk> out of the air and <unk>.
So I <unk> my face on the <unk> and <unk> my <unk> to a <unk> corner of the room.
And I said high <unk>, "<unk>, what, we know that if this book is not going to be <unk>, you don't.
Because as you see, I'm <unk> everything I have, I don't have that.
So if you want it to be better, you have to <unk> and do your side.
Okay. But if you don't do it, you know what, you don't know anything.
I started to write the same because it's my work.
And I want to say that it was <unk> that I was now <unk> to do my <unk>. "And finally, it's like, OK -- <unk>, <unk>, OK -- <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and music that would <unk> <unk> that <unk> for hours and hours to <unk>.
And they were always <unk>, because the <unk> were <unk> and <unk>.
But every once a while, <unk>, something <unk>, and one of these <unk> artists actually <unk>.
And I know I'm talking about, I know that you have seen all, at some point, a <unk>.
It was like the time <unk>, and the <unk> <unk> through a kind of <unk> and he wasn't doing anything different from usually, like <unk> before, but everything <unk>.
And suddenly you don't just <unk> as a human.
But it <unk> from <unk> and <unk> <unk> in the <unk>.
And when this <unk>, people <unk> what was, he was <unk> him. He <unk> him.
I <unk> my hands and <unk> to <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, God," God, "
That's God, you know.
<unk> <unk> -- when the <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> of <unk>, you <unk> this <unk> with them and the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, which you can still hear in <unk> or in <unk>.
In <unk>, when a artist has done something impossible and <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> -- a <unk> of God.
And it's because we need to do it.
But, the problem comes the next day, for <unk> itself, when you <unk> and <unk> that are 11 11 <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
It's just a <unk> with great <unk> to <unk>, and maybe never <unk> to <unk> it to that <unk>.
And perhaps nobody <unk> the name of God still <unk>, and what does it have to do with the rest of his life?
It's hard.
This is one of the most <unk> <unk> to do in a <unk> life.
But perhaps it doesn't have to be so <unk> if you can't believe, <unk>, that the most <unk> of your being come from you.
But I just <unk> you that data from a <unk> of this <unk> <unk> of this <unk> <unk> of this <unk>, which is going to go to <unk>, when you're finished.
And, you know, if we think about this way everything changes.
And so I started to <unk>, and it's certainly how I <unk> for several months during the <unk> of the book that I was going to do, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And what I have to continue to <unk> when I feel like this is, I'm not afraid to be.
You can't <unk>. You just <unk> your work.
You can <unk> for your side, any one can be.
If your work is <unk>, you're <unk>.
If the <unk>, you're going to be <unk> <unk> some kind of <unk>, for one moment through your <unk>, then through your <unk>, "<unk>!"
You do the same your <unk>.
And "<unk>!" <unk>! "
I think that's <unk> <unk>.
"<unk>!" <unk>. "
Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk>: <unk>.
You know, I've already talked about some of these projects on the human genome, what can <unk> and about new genes of.
We're now <unk> a new path: we started <unk> biology and now from that digital code, we're <unk> in a new <unk> of biology, <unk> and <unk> life.
We always tried to <unk> <unk>.
"What is life?" It's something that many <unk>, I think they have <unk> to understand at different levels.
We tried different <unk>, <unk> to <unk>.
We're <unk> for almost 20 years.
When we <unk> the human genome <unk>, we <unk> from the world of biology to the digital world of the computer.
Now, we can <unk> life, or create new life from this digital universe?
This is a map of a small <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, which is the species from the <unk> genome between those that can <unk> into the lab.
And we tried to reduce the genome to <unk> one even smaller.
We can <unk> a <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the genes that are here.
But when you look at his <unk> map, it's just <unk> to our <unk> map.
<unk>, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can <unk>, one at one at a time, it's very <unk> that it can bring to a <unk> cell.
So I thought the only way to <unk> was <unk> this <unk> so that we could <unk> the <unk> to <unk> some of these questions.
And so we started the <unk> of the <unk>, we can <unk> a <unk>?
Can the chemistry <unk> of producing these big molecules that we've never been able to create before?
And in case, what is we can make a <unk>?
A <unk> is just a piece of <unk> material.
The speed with which we are able to <unk> life is <unk> to <unk> <unk>.
Our ability to write the <unk> code, instead, it <unk> slowly, but it's <unk>.
And our <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We've <unk> over 15 years ago.
The process has <unk> a lot of <unk>, <unk> with a <unk> <unk> before they <unk> the first experiments.
But we discovered that DNA <unk> is very difficult.
There are <unk> of thousands of cars in the world that are <unk> small <unk> of DNA, of 30 in 50 <unk>, and it's a <unk> process. The <unk> is long, the <unk> is long, there are there.
So we had to develop a new way to <unk> these <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And this was our first <unk>, starting from information digital information of the <unk> genome of <unk> <unk>.
It's a small virus that <unk> bacteria.
We have the <unk>, we've designed the <unk> <unk> and <unk> a <unk> of DNA around <unk> <unk>.
The interesting part is when we've got this piece of <unk> <unk>, and we <unk> it in bacteria, bacteria have <unk> to read this code, and <unk> the <unk> particles.
<unk> <unk> are <unk> by cells, are <unk> back and they <unk> the <unk> <unk>.
I've been talking about recently with members of the <unk> industry that they've certainly <unk> this model.
They have more than you.
I think this is a situation where the software can actually build the same <unk> in a <unk> system.
But I could do the bigger things.
You want to build the entire <unk> of the <unk>.
They are more than <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
So we thought we were <unk> in the size of the virus, so that that we can change the <unk> to understand what the <unk> are <unk> of a <unk> cell.
<unk> is <unk>, and if you <unk> information with information <unk> in a computer, they need to be very <unk>.
When you <unk> this genome for the first time in <unk>, the standard <unk> was a <unk> for every 10 <unk> <unk>.
We've discovered, <unk>, 30 <unk>. If you were using that original <unk> sequence, you never could do it.
One part of the process is design <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> with all the other <unk> <unk> to build smaller <unk> <unk> <unk> to build smaller <unk> <unk>.
And you have a little bit of <unk> here.
You've probably read you in the <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>: We have a <unk> code on four <unk> <unk>: A, <unk>, <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> of those <unk> <unk> <unk> together about 20 <unk>, and there's a <unk> order for every <unk>.
So we can use the code to write words, <unk>, <unk>.
What we've done at the beginning was <unk>.
Some of them were <unk> by the fact that it wasn't <unk>.
We designed these <unk> to <unk> just <unk> <unk> with <unk>.
There are <unk> that <unk> them and <unk> <unk>.
And we started <unk> <unk>, <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
But anyway, we have made these <unk> in <unk> so that we're <unk> to create a very <unk> <unk>, as you'll see in a minute.
We're trying to <unk> the process.
So, this seems the <unk> of a <unk> <unk>.
When you start these <unk> much, much than 100 <unk>, you don't get any more than 100 <unk>, you don't get <unk> to the <unk>.
You get to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of <unk> biology.
So we've <unk> other <unk>.
<unk> of another <unk> called <unk> <unk>, which in biology <unk> to <unk> DNA, and <unk> the <unk>.
Here's an example.
This <unk>, called <unk> <unk>, can <unk> three million <unk> <unk>.
You can see in the <unk> like his <unk> <unk> is <unk>.
In 12 hours, it's <unk> <unk> as it was before.
<unk> thousands of organisms that are able to do that.
These organisms can completely <unk>.
We want to live under <unk>.
I'm absolutely sure that life <unk> in space, and you <unk> to find new <unk> of water <unk>.
Actually, NASA showed that this is happening.
This is a image of the <unk> that we've built using these <unk>, just using the <unk> <unk> with the design of <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This image was not <unk> with a <unk> <unk> <unk>, but with a <unk> <unk>.
It's such a <unk> that we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk>.
These are pictures that <unk> a period of about six seconds.
This is the <unk> that we've done a little time ago.
They are more than <unk> <unk> code.
It's the largest <unk> of a <unk> structure that's never <unk> by man.
It's got a <unk> <unk> at 300 million.
If you <unk> it with a <unk> 10, you'll be <unk> pages to <unk> this code.
Now, how do we make it work? How do we make it work?
<unk>, through a virus is a kids.
It's a little bit more <unk> when you use bacteria.
It's easier when it comes to the <unk> cells like our: you can just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> another, which is almost the process of <unk>.
In <unk>, the <unk> is <unk> instead <unk> in the cell, but we have <unk> <unk> that we're able to do a <unk> <unk> from a cell to another and <unk>.
We've <unk> a <unk> <unk> from a species.
The two are how much the men from <unk>.
We've <unk> some <unk> <unk> in a way that we could decide what to <unk> for this <unk>.
And then he <unk> it with <unk> so that they <unk> all the <unk>.
And when we put it in the cell, it was <unk>, and we <unk> our <unk> <unk>, the new <unk> went into the cell.
And we were <unk> that we didn't go beyond, but we tried to <unk> more in there.
This is one of the major <unk> of evolution.
We discovered that <unk> species have <unk> a second or a third <unk> somewhere, <unk>, <unk> in a second thousands of new <unk> to that species.
So who think about evolution as one <unk> at a time you <unk>, you know, you don't really understand a lot of biology.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> DNA.
The <unk> that was in the cell didn't <unk> one.
The <unk> <unk> we <unk> it.
It's <unk>, and it <unk> the other <unk> as <unk>, <unk> it, and we <unk> with only the cell and the new <unk>.
It's become blue because of the genes we've <unk>.
And in a short time, all the <unk> of a species, you go <unk>, and it <unk> of all the <unk> of a new species, <unk> on the new software that we <unk> in the cell.
All the <unk> are <unk>, <unk> are <unk>, and when you <unk> the <unk> code, you're <unk>.
Now, this may seem <unk> <unk>, but we can <unk> the software, we can change things in a pretty <unk>.
Now, I've already <unk> that you don't talk about <unk> -- but in progress from three and a half million years of evolution, and I've already said that we're going to create a new version of the <unk> <unk> in which we're going to create new species on this digital process.
Why do that?
I think that's quite <unk> when we think about our <unk>.
We're going to go from six and a half billion people to <unk> billion over the next 40 years.
Just to give one example: I was born in <unk>.
There are now three people on the planet to <unk> <unk> in <unk>; in 40 years, there will be four.
We're <unk> problems now to get food, <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> for six billion and a half billions of people.
I'll still <unk> to do it for nine billion.
<unk> over five billion <unk>, over 30 billion <unk>.
That means 100 million <unk> a day.
When we're trying to find <unk> <unk>, or any kind of process to <unk>, it's going to be a huge challenge.
We have to realize all of the <unk> of CO2 from these materials that <unk> in the atmosphere.
At the day, because of the <unk> <unk> <unk> in the world, we have a <unk> with about 20 million genes, and I like to think that are <unk> <unk> for the future.
<unk> <unk> only one <unk> about <unk>, and you think about how many different things are <unk> out.
Our <unk> here is <unk> data from the reality <unk> and our imagination.
We have now <unk>, because of these <unk> <unk> <unk>, able to create what we call <unk> <unk>.
We can build a big robot that can produce a million <unk> a day.
Think about <unk> these 20 million genes or <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, to <unk> <unk> to produce <unk> or <unk>, new <unk>, we can change, because of a small team, and create <unk> biology now in the last 20 years of science.
And it's just a standard <unk>.
We can have choice for <unk>, chemistry or <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
This is a <unk> of some <unk> software that we're working on to be able to <unk> and design species to the computer.
Well, we don't know how they will be.
We know exactly what their <unk> code.
We're now <unk> on the <unk> <unk>.
You've seen that <unk> from <unk> was an experiment.
We've <unk> second and third generation that we <unk> enough enough to <unk> <unk> as soon as they <unk> as much as the <unk> or kinds of <unk>.
But the only way biology can be a big way without <unk> <unk>, and <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, for <unk>, and we're working with for <unk> cells that can reach this purpose, and we think we can reach up to design cells that can reach that reach that purpose, and we're going to have the first <unk> generation in about 18 months.
<unk> <unk> with CO2 is a <unk>, but in our <unk> in our <unk> around the world, we found different <unk>.
This is a <unk> that we've <unk> in <unk>.
<unk> in the ocean, at about <unk> meters deep at about <unk> feet deep at the temperature of water.
They're <unk> by CO2 by by using hydrogen <unk> as a source of energy.
We're trying to understand if we can <unk> CO2, which can be <unk> by <unk>, <unk> that it can be <unk> by <unk>, to drive this process.
So, short, we think that we might be able to <unk> what the basic question is what life is, we, we have the <unk> goal of <unk> the whole <unk> industry.
<unk>. If you can't do it from TED, where do you?
We have a <unk> of energy.
<unk>, we're working for the same <unk> to create <unk> <unk>.
You've seen this year with flu, we're always back a year and with a dollar in less when you're going to find the <unk> right.
I think that you can make <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk>.
That's how the future could begin to look like <unk>, now, the tree of evolution, <unk> the <unk> with bacteria, <unk>, <unk> cells.
We are so much about <unk> people.
Our purpose is to make a way of living enough to <unk> to try to <unk>. Thank you very much.
I'm going to show you, the <unk> <unk>, the <unk> possible, some <unk> work that we've taken out <unk> <unk> to a <unk> almost a year ago. This is <unk>.
It's a environment where you can <unk> is at local level that you can <unk> with a huge amount of <unk> data.
We're seeing here here, we're seeing <unk> pictures of <unk> with a kind of <unk> <unk> and <unk>, for a quick <unk>, <unk> the images like we want.
And it doesn't matter how big the amount of information that we see, how big these are <unk> of data or images.
Most of them are <unk> photographs, but this is a <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of <unk>, and <unk> in the <unk> <unk>.
It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that <unk> <unk> the <unk> of a system like this is the number of <unk> on your screen at any time. It's also a very <unk> architecture.
This is a whole book, example of data, I'm not about <unk>.
This is <unk> <unk> <unk>. Every <unk> <unk> is a <unk>.
And to say that it's <unk> and <unk>, we can do something like that, to actually see that it's a real <unk> of <unk>, not a picture.
It might be a way of <unk> to read a book.
I'm not going to <unk> it.
This is a more <unk> example. It's a number of 99.
Every image is the beginning of a <unk>.
And it really gives you the pleasure and the beautiful experience of reading the real <unk> version of a <unk> or a <unk>, which is for nature, a <unk> kind of a half.
We also did something with the corner of this particular number in the <unk>.
We've created a <unk> <unk> <unk> much than what you use in a normal <unk>, and we <unk> it from <unk>.
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk>, you can see here.
Or other models, or even <unk> <unk>.
And that really <unk> some of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of space on the screen.
I thought this was going to be <unk> to the <unk> and other <unk> like that, you can't be <unk>.
Of course, <unk> is one of the most <unk> <unk> for this kind of technology.
And on this this, I don't want to lose time, if not to say that we have <unk> to do this field.
These are all the streets in the United States <unk> over the United States <unk>.
So now I'm going to take something else.
This is actually in the web of the web. You can see it.
This is a project called <unk>, which is two different technologies.
One is <unk> and the other is a <unk> research that's very interesting that you made by <unk> <unk>, a <unk> student of the Washington <unk>, with the help of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And it's alive on the web, <unk> by <unk>.
You can see when we do this kind of <unk>, where we can go from a image to the other and have this kind of experience <unk> <unk>.
But the <unk> of the images here has actually actually meaning.
The <unk> <unk> of the computer <unk> these images together, so that they <unk> to the <unk> places where the <unk> all <unk> near the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> have been <unk>. Here you see some <unk> of a <unk> <unk> or <unk>, and these things have been <unk> on <unk> level.
I don't know if I have time to show you some other environment.
There are some much more <unk>.
I want to go directly to one of the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> data, and this <unk> from a <unk> <unk> that we've done for the first time, I <unk> to show you what <unk> is really the key behind this technology, the <unk> <unk>. And it's not as <unk> as <unk> as we've <unk> to do the website.
We had to <unk> some <unk> <unk> and <unk>.
This is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> images in <unk>, other <unk> and so on. And I <unk> of these <unk> <unk>, a image that's discovery <unk> to this model.
So, they're all <unk> images from <unk> and have been all <unk> on this <unk> level.
And it's possible to <unk> this <unk> way.
You know, I never thought of an <unk> to work for <unk>.
It's very <unk> to <unk> this kind of <unk> here.
I think you can see that it's a lot of different kinds of <unk>: from those cell phones, a number, <unk>, a <unk> number, <unk> together in this environment.
And if I can, I can try and <unk> those <unk>.
Many of them are <unk> by <unk>, etc.
<unk> some of this, you find a series of photographs -- <unk>.
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We can go from <unk> to the physics of this environment.
The <unk> point is that we can do things with the environment. This is <unk> data from the whole <unk> data from the whole <unk> of how we <unk> the earth, from a <unk> <unk> and <unk> all that data together.
All those pictures become <unk> together, more than the <unk>.
You have a whole model of the land that's going to <unk>.
Think about this as <unk> of the <unk> of <unk>'s work on Earth.
It's something that's <unk> <unk> as people <unk>, and <unk> for which is <unk> for people who <unk> it with <unk>.
Their pictures are <unk> with <unk> <unk> by other people.
If someone comes the idea of <unk> all these <unk> <unk>, the name, my picture of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> all of that data, and I can use as a <unk> point of <unk> to <unk> in that space, in that <unk>, using the pictures of anyone else, and have a social experience of <unk>.
Of course, a <unk> of all of that are <unk> very <unk> of all the interesting part of the earth, <unk> not only from <unk> <unk> and from <unk> and <unk>, but from <unk> <unk>.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I realized? What does your software <unk> us to do is that at some point, in the next few years, all the photographs that we're in the whole world that's almost almost <unk> together?
<unk>: Yeah. What's doing is it's basically <unk>.
It's creating <unk>, if you want, between images to.
And it's doing it at the content of images.
And what becomes very interesting if you think of the <unk> information that a lot of these <unk> images.
As you do a <unk> of images on the web, you <unk> a <unk> and the <unk> on the web has a lot of information about pictures.
Now, what happens if that picture <unk> all your picture?
So the amount of <unk> <unk> and the amount of <unk> that <unk> is really enormous. It's a <unk> effect of the network.
CA: <unk>, it's really incredible.
<unk>: I'm going to <unk> you very much.
One of the major <unk> when you <unk> and one of the <unk> research <unk> is that we can live in the <unk> <unk>, between who has <unk> the past in the wind, we <unk> it in the <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> it in the <unk> <unk> of plants.
I think that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> even beyond the <unk> <unk>, or <unk> <unk> <unk> are still <unk> <unk> of <unk>, or in <unk>, or in <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> still the <unk> <unk> of the <unk>, and that the idea that the world in which the world in which the world in which we live in in a sense, but it's only a <unk> of reality,
the <unk> of a particular <unk> of <unk> of <unk> choices that our <unk> has done, well or evil, a lot of <unk>.
And, of course, all <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Everybody <unk>. <unk>.
We're <unk> to <unk>.
We have to <unk> the death <unk>, so we don't <unk> if we <unk> and <unk> --
We all have a art.
What's the <unk> is the <unk> of the song, the <unk> of the <unk> of every culture.
It doesn't matter that matter that's the <unk> of the <unk>, or the <unk> of <unk> <unk>, or <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, or a <unk> in the <unk> of <unk>.
He was my <unk> of <unk> journey in <unk> a month ago, or a <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk>, the <unk>'s mother's mother's <unk>.
All of these <unk> <unk> that there are other ways of <unk> other ways of thinking, other ways of moving in the world.
And if you <unk>, it's a concept that can give you hope.
<unk>, the <unk> of the world create a <unk> of <unk> life and <unk> that <unk> the planet and is important for the <unk> of the planet as the <unk> <unk> as <unk>.
And you can think of this <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and you can <unk> the total <unk> of all the <unk>, the <unk> of all the <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> in being from the human imagination from <unk>.
<unk> is the <unk> of humanity.
It's the <unk> of what we are and what we can be as <unk> species.
And <unk>, the <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> happened to the <unk> and <unk> much faster.
<unk> <unk>, for example, <unk> that 50 percent of all species has been or is on the <unk> of <unk>, because it's <unk>, or <unk>, the most <unk> -- in the <unk> of diversity -- and you don't even <unk> to <unk> <unk> -- that diversity.
The <unk> of that is, of course, the <unk> <unk>.
When you're <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on this planet.
A language is not just <unk> by a <unk> or from a series of <unk> rules.
One is the <unk> of the <unk> of the human spirit.
It's the half the <unk> that the <unk> of every culture is coming in in the world.
Every language is a forest of the mind, a <unk>, a <unk> of <unk>.
And of those <unk> <unk>, as we are sitting here at <unk>, at least half, it's not <unk> in the <unk> of children.
They're no longer <unk> to children, which means less than <unk>, unless you know something, which is already death.
What's more <unk> than being <unk> by the <unk>, the last one that is the last one to talk, which is not having a way to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk>?
This <unk> <unk> is a <unk> of someone in the world every two weeks, every two weeks, every two weeks, a <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> with <unk> <unk> language.
And I know that someone of you know, "<unk>'t that?
The world would not be a better place if we could all be a better place if we all talk about it. <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>.
<unk> of a <unk> thing is, that you can't speak your language.
I'd like to give you a journey through the <unk> --
a small <unk> journey in the <unk> to give you a <unk> of what we're <unk>.
Many of us <unk> that when I say, "I mean," I really mean different ways of <unk>.
And so, for example, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, which <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's a <unk> that's not able to <unk> the blue color from green because the green time is <unk> in the forest, where the forest is <unk>, from which <unk> <unk>.
They have a <unk> language and a <unk> rule, <unk> <unk> <unk>.
But all of that has been <unk> in the past, is that in these families, you're talking about six or seven <unk> because of the <unk> <unk> <unk> no <unk>.
You start listening and then you start to speak.
I <unk> one of the most interesting <unk> I've lived with, the <unk> <unk> <unk>, an incredible <unk> that had the first <unk> in <unk>.
In the <unk> five <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
They made from the top photographs that <unk> them in <unk> <unk>, <unk> that this <unk> forest <unk> <unk>, and <unk> that this <unk> forest <unk> never seen anything about <unk>.
They <unk> the picture from the ground, they <unk> them to <unk> a form or a <unk> and, you didn't know, they <unk> that they <unk> the <unk>, and they <unk> the five <unk> with <unk>.
But <unk> don't just <unk> <unk>.
They <unk> to each other.
<unk> percent <unk> was <unk> by themselves.
We were at eight <unk>, and we found two <unk> of death, and when we <unk> to know, they <unk> that one of them was <unk> so that he <unk>, and then <unk> it. And then, they <unk> it.
The <unk> were able to recognize the animal <unk> 40 <unk> and to <unk> the species.
<unk> years early '<unk>, I was <unk> a very interesting task when my <unk> <unk> <unk> me if I <unk> to go to <unk> my <unk>, I was <unk> if I wanted to go to <unk> between society at the base <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
To make sense of <unk>, I should understand the <unk> culture, and that <unk> is not <unk> <unk>.
It's quite a <unk> view of the world.
Very interesting.
If you ask to <unk> the great <unk> of the world, what would you <unk> me?
<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, etc.
A continent is always left out, thinking that Africa has not been <unk> <unk>. And instead, and the <unk> is not anything else that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
What makes interesting is the <unk> <unk> is the <unk> relationship between life and death.
So, <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> can be <unk> by the <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the live in such a short, the <unk> becomes the <unk>.
That's why <unk> <unk> to say, "<unk>, you go to <unk> to the <unk> to speak about God.
We <unk> in <unk> and <unk> God. "
And since you're <unk>, is the spirit that <unk> you, is the spirit that <unk> you, how can you <unk>?
So you get to these incredible events: <unk> <unk> <unk> in the state of <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a rather <unk> of the power of the mind, when it's <unk> in a state of <unk> <unk>.
I <unk> all the <unk> with which I've lived with the most <unk> <unk> are the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, in the <unk> <unk>.
<unk> of the <unk> civilization, which once <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> in <unk>, the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk>.
In a <unk> continent, this <unk> has never been <unk> by <unk>.
In <unk>, I've been <unk> by a <unk>, but their <unk> is <unk> extraordinary.
The young people are <unk> away from <unk> to <unk>, and they live <unk> in a world made of <unk> and <unk> in <unk> world for 18 years.
Two <unk> years old <unk> of the way to <unk> the nine months of <unk> that <unk> in the <unk> of mother, now are <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
For that time, they're <unk> to the values of their society, values that <unk> their <unk> and only their <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or to say <unk> <unk>.
At the <unk> of this incredible <unk>, they're <unk> out and for the first time in them, at 18 years, see an <unk>. And in that moment of the first <unk>, when the sun <unk> <unk> <unk>, everything they've learned in theory, when the sun <unk> <unk> <unk>, everything they've learned in the <unk>. The <unk> <unk> is all <unk> in his <unk>. The <unk> <unk> is <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> is <unk>.
"<unk>? I'm going to show you.
It's <unk>. Now it's going to be <unk>. "
They call <unk>, more <unk>, and we, <unk> <unk>, we are the <unk> of the world's <unk>.
This level of <unk> is extremely important.
When we think about <unk> <unk> and the <unk> environment, we <unk> <unk>, and the old story of <unk> <unk>, which is a <unk> concept in his <unk> or maybe <unk> <unk> and say that these are <unk> <unk> to Earth than us.
<unk> <unk> are not <unk> or <unk> <unk> by the <unk>.
There's no space for these things in the <unk> <unk> of <unk>, but because of time and <unk>, have created a <unk> of the Earth <unk>, <unk>, which is not about the concept of <unk> <unk> <unk>. But on a <unk> <unk>, but the concept that the Earth can live because it is <unk> by human <unk>.
What does that mean?
I mean that a <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> <unk> that the mountain is a <unk> of <unk> that <unk> its <unk> is going to be a <unk> <unk> different, and will have a <unk> <unk> different. And will have a mountain, <unk> of <unk> that would be <unk> to be <unk>.
<unk> is a <unk> of a spirit or a <unk> <unk> is <unk>.
What's interesting is the <unk> that <unk> the relationship between <unk> and the natural world.
I grew up in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that the <unk> <unk> to be <unk>.
That made me a human being different human being friends as a different human <unk> that <unk> are <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
If you start <unk> that these <unk> can create reality, different, we begin to begin to understand some <unk> <unk>. They have this <unk>.
I've <unk> this to <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Maybe some of you have heard about <unk>, the most powerful <unk> <unk> <unk>.
What makes <unk> is not the <unk> potential of <unk>, but its <unk>. It's <unk> by two elements.
On the one hand, this <unk> <unk> <unk> that has a series of <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
<unk> the <unk> <unk>, you have a <unk> <unk> that <unk> a little bit of <unk>, but it's <unk> with <unk> of a <unk>'s family <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This <unk> <unk> <unk>, very similar to <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
If you ever see the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk> that's <unk> <unk>.
It's like being <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a sea of electricity. It doesn't make a <unk> of electricity. It doesn't make a <unk> of reality.
I was often <unk> with my <unk>, Richard <unk> <unk>, the man who <unk> the <unk> was <unk>, with his discovery of <unk> <unk> in the '<unk>.
And I think my <unk> you can't <unk> these <unk> as a <unk> because if you can't tell anybody to be <unk>.
It's possible to <unk> <unk> only if you <unk> with other <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk>.
Now, the <unk> that are <unk> in this <unk> are <unk>, <unk> <unk>, the same <unk> to <unk> the <unk>. <unk> question: in a <unk> of plants, how these <unk> <unk> <unk>, how these <unk> <unk> <unk>, two <unk>, not similar, but that if you <unk> this way, they create a <unk> that's <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk>?
We use the great <unk> of <unk> and <unk>, which can <unk> <unk>.
But if we were to <unk>, we're going to <unk>. "
What does that mean?
This <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, which <unk> <unk> in the forest, and that our eyes are going to in the same species.
If you ask them how they <unk> their <unk> <unk> <unk> us, "<unk> <unk> of plants, you don't know everything?" I said, "No."
The solution is: you take the <unk> <unk> in a night that's moon full and <unk> <unk> with a different <unk>.
With this not <unk>, you're going to <unk>, but it's much more interesting you're going to <unk>.
Now, the problem is that even those of us who have heart <unk> <unk> them, but somehow <unk> to the <unk> of history than we have about history than our real world, and <unk> beyond.
In fact, the <unk> century, <unk>, not <unk> <unk> for its <unk> <unk> or its <unk> <unk>, but rather like the one in which we <unk>, and we <unk> <unk> <unk>, or <unk> the <unk> of the diversity and <unk> and <unk> the planet. Now the problem is not the change.
All the <unk> through the <unk> have been <unk> in a <unk> for new possibilities of life.
And the problem is not technology.
<unk> <unk> don't have <unk> to be <unk> when they put up <unk> and <unk> as well as <unk> have <unk>, as they have <unk> as they've <unk> <unk> and <unk>.
It's not the change or technology that <unk> <unk> <unk>. It's power.
The <unk> <unk> of <unk>.
And if you look at the world, you know, you're not <unk> to <unk>.
They are <unk> and <unk> <unk> out of the <unk> forces that go beyond their <unk> <unk>.
<unk> that <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> --
a <unk> <unk> <unk>, where <unk> <unk> <unk>, a <unk> that has lived free free free in the forest until one generation ago, and now <unk> to the <unk> <unk>, where you can see the <unk> <unk> from the <unk> that <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk>,
I started <unk> <unk> with the <unk> <unk> <unk> to the forest.
Or, in <unk> case, it's disease that are <unk> with the <unk> of the <unk>.
If you <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk>, where I'm doing a lot of research, you'll see the <unk> of politics.
As a <unk>, <unk> physics of a <unk>, is <unk> at <unk> level, but <unk>, <unk>, the <unk> of <unk>'s life, not only is not just <unk>, but <unk> in some <unk>, because it's part of the development of development.
And you can't understand the <unk> of the <unk> until you go out from the beginning.
I <unk> <unk> miles from <unk> in the Western China through the <unk> <unk>, <unk> to <unk> with a young <unk>, but only <unk> to <unk>. I realized what's behind the <unk> that I'm talking about.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> million people <unk> from the <unk> <unk> during the <unk> <unk>.
The father of this guy was <unk> to the <unk> <unk>.
which means that it's been <unk> at the time of the Chinese <unk>.
<unk> <unk> is <unk> with <unk> <unk> during the <unk> that led the <unk> in <unk>.
My mother was <unk> and his <unk> was to be <unk>.
It was taken of <unk> in <unk> at age two years, <unk> under his <unk> because he couldn't have to live without him.
The <unk>, who did the same, was <unk> in the <unk> of <unk>.
One day has <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk>, and for this <unk>, was <unk> to the <unk> work for seven years.
The <unk> pain <unk> can be <unk>, but the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> is from present.
And it was, it's all <unk> to a choice.
Do we live in the <unk> world of <unk> or want to <unk> the world <unk> of diversity?
The great <unk> <unk>, before he died said that his largest <unk> was that his largest fear was that, in our going to <unk> this <unk> view of the world, not only <unk> the entire <unk> of human imagination to a <unk> <unk> of thinking, but a day we <unk> us from a <unk> <unk> <unk> that there were other possibilities.
And it's <unk> that our species has been <unk> for <unk> years.
The <unk> <unk>, which has given us agriculture, which has made us <unk>, <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> with the <unk> of <unk>, creating the <unk> of <unk>, creating the <unk> of <unk>, creating the <unk> of <unk>, and we talk about <unk> years ago.
The <unk> world has <unk> 300 years.
That <unk> story, I didn't know, I'm going to <unk> me that we're going to <unk> in <unk> to come.
When these <unk> <unk> of the world is asked what it means to be human, we're going to say, <unk> with different <unk>.
And it's in these answers that we all all <unk> the possibility of being what we're: a <unk> species, which has to <unk> all <unk> and all <unk> can <unk>. And there are great moments of <unk>.
I <unk> this picture on the north <unk> of <unk> island, when I went to <unk> <unk> with <unk>, and this man, <unk> me the wonderful story of her <unk>.
The <unk> government was not always <unk> with the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> to <unk> our <unk>, we <unk> them.
The <unk> of this man is <unk> <unk>.
The family, <unk> for his life, <unk> <unk> all the <unk>, and all his <unk>.
You want to know that <unk> don't <unk> the cold, we will.
The <unk> of <unk> <unk> fish were made into <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> of this man didn't <unk> from night or <unk> from the <unk>.
It's <unk> away, you <unk> the <unk> in your <unk>. When I <unk> her <unk>, they <unk> her <unk>, she <unk> her <unk>, she <unk> her <unk> creating a <unk>.
He <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk> <unk>, and when <unk> <unk>, he <unk> a dog.
He <unk> the dog and created a <unk>, with the <unk> <unk> <unk> created a <unk>, has <unk> another dog, and she's <unk> on the <unk>, <unk> <unk> in <unk>.
Do you want to talk about <unk>? [And that, in different ways, [<unk>] is the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and all the <unk> <unk> of the world.]
<unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> government <unk> to <unk> control the total of <unk> area of an area of bigger <unk> in California and <unk> together.
It's their new <unk>. It's called <unk>.
It's a <unk> <unk>. It's all the resources.
One <unk> example of how a <unk> can <unk> with his <unk>.
And, finally, I think it's quite <unk> at least at least at least at least at least at the <unk> of the planet, I realized that they're not at all.
For someone is home.
<unk> <unk> of the human imagination that <unk> at the <unk> of time. And for us all, the dreams of these children, as the dreams of our children, become part of the <unk> <unk> of hope.
And finally, we have <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> we are <unk> that <unk> <unk>.
I thought the <unk> --
They're not <unk>, but we believe that stories can change the world, and perhaps we are the best <unk> to tell the stories of the world. Every month our website, <unk> <unk> million <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> our <unk> <unk>.
Our <unk> are <unk> by millions of people.
Our work is <unk> in <unk> to <unk> to bring our public to places to <unk> <unk> from which <unk> from <unk> <unk> from how much they saw and, <unk>, <unk> for the <unk>, the <unk> world, in <unk> for <unk>, and we need to find a <unk> world. And we have to find a <unk> world's in a <unk> world and <unk>.
where the <unk> of all the <unk> can <unk> our <unk>.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book, I hope you've already heard and <unk> <unk> some <unk>, in the case you didn't <unk> them.
I want to begin with what I call the <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> what?
The <unk> <unk> of all the <unk> society. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>: "If we want to <unk> the <unk> of our citizens." The way to do it is <unk> freedom to do it is <unk> freedom. "
The reason is, on the side, in fact that freedom is itself a value, is <unk>, <unk>, <unk> for humans.
On the other one is in fact that if we're <unk>, each of us can act to do everything that we <unk> our <unk>, without any <unk> in our own name.
The way to <unk> the freedom is <unk>.
The more choices, the people, the more <unk>, and the more they are, more their <unk>.
This, <unk>, is so <unk> <unk> in the society that nobody <unk> to <unk>.
And it's also <unk> <unk> in our lives.
I'm going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible.
That's my <unk>. It's not particularly big.
I <unk> a simple <unk> on the <unk> to <unk>.
In my <unk>, there are <unk> <unk>, without <unk> the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> and the 12 <unk> <unk> that you can buy a huge number of <unk> in the <unk> <unk> that no one of <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> that no one of the <unk> <unk> is to your <unk>.
Here's what <unk> is like.
Then you go to the <unk> <unk> for buy a <unk>: <unk>, <unk> <unk>, radio, <unk>, <unk>.
And in this single <unk> <unk>, there's a big number of <unk> <unk>.
We can do six and a half million different <unk> using the <unk> that there are in one store.
<unk> <unk> that there is <unk>.
<unk> fields: the world of <unk>.
Once, when I was a child, you could all be able to get all the <unk> <unk>, to <unk> that were <unk> by <unk>.
You <unk> the phone, you don't <unk> it.
One <unk> of that, by the way, was that the phone,
These times they went.
We have now a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, especially between phones.
Here's cell phones from the future.
My <unk> is in the middle, <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, and <unk> for <unk> <unk>.
If you don't have it yet seen in the <unk> store, you're <unk> that soon you're going to get.
And what happens is, people <unk> in <unk>, and it does this question. And you know, what is the answer? The answer is, "No.
You can't buy a cell phone that doesn't <unk> things.
So, in other <unk> of life that are much more important than <unk>, you know, the same <unk> of choices.
<unk> <unk>: It doesn't happen in the United States that you're going to go out and <unk> you're going to do.
Instead, you get from <unk>, and the <unk> says, "OK, you could do. At, or <unk>," he's got these <unk> and these <unk>. "What do you want to do?"
You were, "<unk>, what do you want to do?"
And the <unk> says, "<unk> has these <unk> and these <unk>, and <unk> has these <unk> and these <unk>."
"What do you want to do?"
And you say, "<unk> if she was me, what would you like me, what would you like?"
And the <unk>: "I'm not her."
The <unk> we call it "<unk> <unk> <unk>," <unk> <unk>, "<unk> that makes it look like a <unk>.
But actually, it's not that one <unk> the weight and the responsibility and the responsibility of the <unk> of someone who knows something, <unk> the <unk>, <unk>, <unk> to <unk>, and it's certainly not <unk> -- and it's almost <unk> -- and so it's not in the <unk> to make the patient.
There's a huge <unk> of <unk> <unk>, <unk> to people like me and you, that if you think about it doesn't make sense, because we can't <unk>.
But if we can't <unk>, why do we <unk>?
The answer is that they want to <unk>, we call the <unk> to <unk> <unk>.
<unk>, so it's a fundamental <unk>, which is now a matter of choice, how you see in this <unk>. "We don't want to <unk> children. We don't want to <unk> <unk>. We don't <unk>. <unk> a <unk>: We have to have to <unk>.
And we can <unk> how many times we <unk>.
which means that any <unk>, <unk>, you have to decide what kind of person.
I went to the family and <unk>, a <unk> time perspective, <unk> almost for anyone, was that you <unk> the <unk> as possible, and <unk> to <unk> children as soon as possible.
The only real choice was with who, not when, and what to do after.
<unk>, everything is really to play.
They start to very smart students, and they <unk> their 20 percent less work than a time.
And not because they're <unk>, not because they're <unk>.
but why are they <unk>, you know, "<unk> <unk>, you know, you're going to do it now?"
"<unk> <unk> later? I have to think before you get kids or career or to career?"
I'm <unk> <unk>.
And they try to answer these questions, even though this <unk> doesn't <unk> the <unk> that you can't get a <unk> <unk> to my <unk>.
And they need to do that. They're important questions.
Now, the work: we're <unk>, as <unk> <unk>, because technology <unk> <unk> us to work on every minute, from the planet, <unk> that from <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, there's a <unk>, and I won't say anybody, where the <unk> works.
I'm not telling you, because I want to use.
What does this incredible freedom of choice of choice we have about work? That's that we need to have it, we need to decide at all time, if we have to work or not.
We can go to our son to play <unk>, with the cell in a <unk>, the <unk> in the other, and the <unk>, <unk>.
And even though they're all <unk>, every minute we see our son, we're <unk>, "I have to <unk> this call?"
"<unk> to <unk> this <unk>? I have to <unk> this letter?"
And even when the answer is, "that all of this makes the <unk> of your child very different than what would would be in other conditions.
So, from all of all, small things, small objects, big objects, materials and <unk>, life is a question of choices.
Once the world was this: <unk>, there were some possibilities, but not everything was about choice.
The world today's <unk> to this: The <unk> is, "Is it <unk>, or <unk>?"
The answer is <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> we know, we all know, so I'm going to talk about <unk>.
I'm going to have this choice two effects, two <unk> <unk> on people.
The first, <unk>, is it <unk> <unk> instead of <unk>.
With many <unk> between which <unk>, becomes very difficult to do it.
I'll give you an example of a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
My <unk> has been <unk> to the <unk> data, <unk> <unk> society, with about a million <unk> <unk> in different <unk> companies.
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are <unk>, more, the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> two percent.
With 50 <unk>, there's 10 percent less than <unk>, when they're available to be five percent. Why?
Because with 50 <unk>, you know, you're going to have to decide, and choice is <unk> to <unk>.
And <unk>, and again in <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and of course, <unk> never comes.
I think it's not just that these <unk> <unk> <unk> food for <unk> because they don't have enough money, you want to say that the decision is so <unk> that you also have the decision <unk> of work.
They're not going to be <unk> to five <unk> <unk> per year from work, which would be <unk> to <unk>.
So, <unk> is a <unk> of having <unk> choices.
And I think we're going to do this world.
"And finally, for <unk>: <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> or <unk>?"
You want to make the right decision, if it's for <unk>, right?
You don't want to choose the wrong bottom, and you <unk> the wrong <unk>.
So this is the first effect. The second is that even though we can <unk> <unk> and make a choice, at the end, we're less <unk> by the end of how you've <unk> <unk>.
And that's why I think that's for different reasons.
One of them is that with a lot of <unk> between which <unk>, if you <unk> one and it's not perfect, is easy to imagine that you could make a different choice. And what happens is is, <unk> <unk> us to <unk> about choice, and the <unk> <unk> <unk> by the decision,
even when it was a <unk> decision.
More choices there are, easier to <unk> than any <unk> that's <unk> of choice.
<unk>, there is what <unk> call.
Dan <unk> has <unk> very well <unk> like the value that we give things to things that are <unk> with.
<unk> everything else, when you have a lot of <unk>, it's easy to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and be less than the <unk> <unk>.
Here's an example. I'm <unk> with all of the ones that are not in New York.
But that's what you probably understand.
There's this <unk> to <unk>.
A place of <unk>.
<unk> <unk>. I love day. It's all for them.
I don't know anything. But what he thinks is, "Well, <unk>, it's <unk>."
"All my <unk> is away."
"<unk> <unk> <unk> right in front of the house."
And it goes two weeks, I'm going to go out of the idea that's going to be <unk>, where it wants.
The <unk> <unk> for what we have, even when the choice was <unk>.
And the more the <unk> we have from <unk>, the more the <unk> that we have from <unk>, the <unk>.
Here's another example.
This <unk> tells us a lot of things.
It's about living the moment, and perhaps living.
But the most important point is that anything you're going to, you're going to <unk>, you're going to be <unk> to do other.
The things that don't know many <unk> that can make less <unk> what we do.
<unk> <unk>: <unk> <unk>.
I tried it on my skin <unk> a new couple of <unk>.
It's always <unk>.
Once the <unk> were just like, I had them and <unk> them to <unk>, they were <unk>, only after <unk> <unk> a <unk>, and they were <unk>, only after <unk> a <unk> <unk>, I was going to well.
So, I went to <unk> a couple of when the <unk>, they went, and I said, "I need a couple of <unk>, this is my <unk>."
And the <unk> said to me, "Do you want to <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>?"
Do you want to <unk> or <unk>?
"Do you want to <unk>?"
"<unk> <unk> <unk> them or <unk>? <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> --" <unk> to <unk>.
I was <unk>, and after some I was able to say, "I want the guy to say," I want the only guy that was, so for an hour, I'm <unk> all <unk> <unk> <unk>, then <unk>, and then <unk> from the <unk>, <unk>, and then <unk> out of the <unk> store, <unk>, and then I <unk> out of the best <unk> I ever had.
It was <unk>. With all that choice I had to <unk> the best.
But I'm worse.
Why? I wrote a whole book for <unk>.
The reason I was worse is that with all that choice my <unk> were <unk>, the <unk> <unk> to be <unk>.
I had <unk> <unk>. I didn't know anything about <unk> when I just had one guy, but when I had 100 different, I thought, I had to be perfect.
And what I had <unk> was good, but I didn't do it.
And after I <unk> that I had to <unk> with what I was <unk> in <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> in the people of life, <unk>, which is not <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> themselves.
And this <unk> <unk>, even when the results are good.
<unk> in the world of <unk> <unk>.
Because if I <unk>, I don't know what I'm talking about.
The truth is more to that.
"And he was better when he was worse when he was worse," when he was worse, he was when he was worse, he was possible to <unk> <unk>.
<unk>, in the world that we live in -- <unk>, <unk> citizens with the <unk> of <unk> -- the <unk> that we can <unk> is that things are at <unk>.
You never <unk> <unk> because your <unk>, because your <unk>, my <unk>, <unk>.
The <unk> of happiness -- that you're here -- is, you want to say, "You want it."
I mean -- small moment <unk> -- that I'm really <unk> and my wife is really <unk>.
I couldn't do better, I didn't <unk>.
But <unk>, it's not always <unk>.
I mean, a <unk> of the buy a couple of <unk> <unk> when there is just that kind of <unk> is that when you're not <unk>, and I'm going to ask you, "Why?"
"Who is <unk>?" The answer is <unk>.
The world is <unk>. What could I do do?
When you have hundreds of <unk>, and you <unk> a <unk>, and you'll <unk> one <unk>, and you'll know who's the <unk>, it's clear that the <unk> you are.
You could do better.
With hundreds of <unk> available, there are not <unk> for <unk>.
So when people make decisions, even though the <unk> is <unk>, you're <unk> and <unk> to them.
In the last few years, <unk> is <unk> in the world.
I think a <unk> <unk> -- not the only, but important -- of this <unk> <unk> is that people have experiences because the standard are too <unk>.
And when they have to <unk> this situation they think <unk> is them.
So the final result is that in general we're better, we're <unk>, but we're going to <unk> worse.
Let me show you.
This is <unk> <unk>, what we all take for good, and it's completely <unk>. It's not true.
There is no <unk> that a little bit of choice is better than <unk>, but from this is not <unk> that much choice is better than a little bit.
There's a <unk>, <unk>. I don't know what it is.
But I'm quite sure we've <unk> from a piece of the level in which the choices are <unk> our life.
Now, from a <unk>'s point of view -- I almost finished -- from a point of view, <unk> is <unk>.
That allows all this choice in <unk> society is the <unk> <unk>.
There are many places in the world, and you're going to be <unk> <unk>, where the problem is not that they have <unk> choice.
The problem is they have it too <unk>.
So, the <unk> I'm talking about is a <unk> <unk> of <unk>, <unk> <unk> society.
And what <unk> is doing <unk> and <unk> is this: <unk> <unk> <unk> you've talked to you yesterday about how much <unk> and <unk> for <unk> are <unk>. It's a <unk> of money.
I mean that these choices, <unk> and <unk>, is not that they're just <unk>.
I'm <unk> <unk>.
They're worse.
If a little bit of what in our society allows choice to be <unk> in those where people have too much <unk>, it would not just their life to <unk>, but our <unk>.
That's what <unk> call.
One <unk> of income is good at all -- not just to poor -- because of this choice in <unk> that we're <unk>.
And so I said, "You know, you want to become everything you want --
<unk>, people of culture, <unk>: "What's you're going to do that?"
"It's <unk> you can't do anything in a <unk> of glass <unk>."
"A <unk>, a <unk> vision of the world --
and I <unk> it like this, at the beginning.
But then, I realized that that the fish knows the long time.
Because the reality of <unk> is that if you <unk> in <unk>, you can't <unk> the freedom. You can't <unk> the freedom. You <unk> the freedom.
If you <unk> the <unk> so that you could <unk> <unk> as <unk> as <unk> as a <unk> as a <unk> as a <unk> as you could <unk> <unk>.
I <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk>.
They all need to have a <unk>.
This is almost certainly <unk>, maybe even for the fish, and certainly for us.
But <unk> <unk> some <unk> <unk> is a <unk> for <unk> and <unk>.
Thank you very much.
