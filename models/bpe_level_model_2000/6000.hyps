Video: All ll right. ALike to the climaticians as a lot of a money to our business and our business.
For this first priority is investing a big money to a big money in a sform of money to the audience, and confusing the versuity of the carbon.
In fact, the carbon is not spor.
We think it's also a good -- has also a good good good provise.
So we don't precupately,
Let me do to do it.

Thank you very much.
The next year, to TED photographs on the LHe's going to be a courage of the Hef.
And promise to recognize to get to the machine.
So the other thing about the other time that the other time that the other time there is the largest experiment of scientific -- 27 miles of conference.
His that the recent of the conditions that were in the beginning of a billion of a second of the universe of the universe of the universe of times to the second.
All of this is simply to be simply it.
This is the machine Ginevat.

This is what work. It's called ATALATALA -- is a 4444 meters and a diameting of 2444444 meters and a diamet.
This is a picture of ATALATALATALA, and you can see the proport to proport the proportion of the AT.
The 10 skets of the room of the first time for the first time for the first time.
And this picture was a picture of ATATATA.
It was because of the immen, the less of the health.
It's a picture of the first picture of the first of the Ho's first of the HHCentrring in collision, with a part of the Look and the C, and he's drawing the level.
In other words, when we see that the picture of the 10 sket, we understand that the machines work, which is a big life.
I was if it was to do it is to do more opope of this is a few of the Google and view that the pay was this in the beginning was this.
What means we had a matter cultural impact of three and scientific scientific scientific of scientific cultural m.
And this is a weeks in a few weeks with the machine, to to these movie here -- these movies here -- these movies here -- these movies --
These movies the 13,000 view when the machines the machine.
Now, the leaders of you look at the movie and the derance and den deal and I'm going to be too much mother."
And instead of the way because when I was very quickly become back to the surfaces.
So, in the 271 gradu, a perature of the space, the space, these movies can bring that the movie can bring that corrup.
In one of the undle of the most emistrong the magneters in the LHC, was a difectly with the game.
So the movies you read to read the 13,000 view of the 13,000 villimproving a resistence.
This was the result.
Now, this is still more impressions if you think that these magnetitive fishing of 20 tones that are worked about 30 centers.
These are danneged about 50 magnet.
We wanted to mean I want to be a little bit of it.
We realized and travels.
We are are going to be able to the place of their place to the place of the tool.
Entrue the end of the end of the LHC will be new integry.
We acceating that we expected, and we expectly to the data to the day, and so our favor so our faviiid that are the universe.
Now, of course, in a certain a certainly re-inspired disease the science of science and the engineering of the science and the idea of the frontic of the frontic of the frontic of the future.
I think the fact that it's so difficult that is so difficult to the things like LHHC.
I want to concept with the words of a scientist, Hephysics Davy, which is that we have to imagine, which is a little bit of the inusing of his hold, the hopen was Michael Fael Fael Michael Freead, "North of human science is that we have to be a birds of human science that is not a new science that that that we don't have to be a new mind of that that new technology,
Thank you.
I want to start ask to do you to think about what to go to the children to the children to the battack.
My understand how to remove them and make them and mother move to be able to remother and mother resolve and solve the problems and solve problems and resolve problems and the relationship.
The reason is is propertive connected to the way to understand that we understand that we can understand the part of the world of us.
So, by inforthisish from the tools of our interaction with the physics of my consults of my consulted with my collaborator Jeevan Kalanith, I started a computers, and when we start a computer, and when we start a computers, and when we have a computer real-real-recent recell as a windristake with a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the information with a physics of the instem of the in-fly real-summmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmer in that that that that that that that that that that that insteadaptly realysic phphph
and system, our pieces our place ace?
The question was so many questions that decided to exploring the answer to the answer Siftable.
In fact, a few words, a Stremendous computer interactive, as a big cool as a bird.
In fact, a few words, a Stremendous computer interactive, as a big cool as a bird.
You can move with the hand, they can see the model of the lor, to feel the model and they have a radio slide and a radio wireless.
But of course, are objects of physics as the mattones, you can move simply to simply reals.
The Stelling examples of a new ecool of a new ecool of the information information of the information of the digital.
And they become more physics, concept of the movies of the movie of the movies that become more than the movie of the movie of the movie of the movie of the movies of the most.
I'm going to be a simple.
This is the Stelling is configurt to show video video you in a direction, the video hand.
These riters interacactive are conflying to the other.
If you do them in the face thing is their intor.
If they are the surgers, and they can get a little bit of a poun.
If they are the surgers, and they can get a little bit of a poun.
They also have their movie model.
We realized that one of the interesting of the interaction of the interaction was the power power to use the data, or "such a liquires as a liquires as a liquirement.
In this case, we three Siftable to configurated as a bad of the narrow of the hours of the color, where they are ask them in the centry.
and I can use them to use them to the horor, where you can be ask it.
If we can be too much -- we can put a little bit of it.
These are also beautiful and you can see the lingur and the mathematics and the people can try to try to try to try to try to try to try to provide things can see things that the resultly result.
Now I'm --
This is a sequence of Fibonacus that I do with a program of equations.
We have a play of words that is in the Scarabeo and Boggly.
Pratrater, to every every pursue a land in the house of the Sout, Proroten a land a line in the house of Siftable, and as a house of the land and as a a destruction.
Then, after about 30 seconds, and I was a new set of the source and new choice and new possible to try to try to try to try to prove it.
Thank you.
So this is the children came in the Middy Lab, I did in the way that I tried them to be a video.
They are pieces of it.
And one of the interesting things of this gence is that we don't tell you that many people to give you a lot of people to do a lot of the people who are going to be able to give you a lot of the things that we don't have to give you a lot of the things of this gence of the stuff.
Do only said, "Well, I mean, "Wole," and they will be exactly what do it.
That's how other people that can try to do it.
This is our best header than the most young of the road.
In fact, it was just imple.
They only only a five of the five of it.
Now, this is an application of a carton of a carton of a religious interactive of a carts.
We wanted to build a tool, to make a cool of the Lui is Felix.
And he will infinding the new person, in the enough in the scen, they were associated ated with their sociates.
And he will infinding the new person, in the enough in the scen, they were associated ated with their sociates.
Eck, it's doing the solid solid the solid solid.
Video: The solie is surgers.

and inventing their story.
Vide: Cia!
DM: It's a story with the person can decide the samazing as you svolve.
DM: It's a story with the person can decide the samazing as you svolve.
Video: Vide: I see it.
DM: The last examples I have the time to show you is a recently to recently recently, to exeffore and exeffor.
is a instrument, recently, to be recently, for the sune and exef.
The Stelling here is a burther like the battery and the batteri.
Every different of these four four different sevariariation and you can get to us.
Then you inolds, to involves these sounds in a sequency of the squence.
And modifishing a simply "such a "sequence."
These are effects of the live of the live and the movie and the movie.
And the attacks to a particular and then then you can get to the sket.
And then there are the effects as time and then they wanted to be applicated to intersequence.
We are going to work as it.
Video: DM: Acertain a basic land "sequences "sequence, the land and we love the other basic system.
Now I was a bassy line.
Video: DM: One of the too of the toward --
Video: DM: And I'll put the movie the movie of the batteri, so I can control the effect.
Video: DM: Posping the intersequence of a line of a line of a time to a led by the other.
Video: DM: And now now I'll be the movie to the movie to the more expression.
Video: DM: Pospital sequence of the sequence.
So I don't have to be the first mother than the first mother more than the long long long long long long long long long long long or more than the long long time.
And finally, I can put the intersequence the intersequence of the left the left Siftline of "Sifttype the She safe.
Thank you.
So, as you can see my passion is build new interface that is build more more and more more more than our brain and the brain and record the brain and the time.
And I had to get time to show you one of the result of this perform and some possible that we can bring out of the lab.
The concept that I want to transmit is that that is that we have to recognize with the media to interact with the media to information in our world that we want to be information in our world way to the way that we want to be a new way to be able to be able to the new way to the new technology.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the time to talk to to everything.
I'm a scrowing writing.
Scare of the bobooks, but it's more than this is more than this, of this is more than this view of this.
It's also also the friends and the fashing of my life.
And I don't expect that can change it.
But he said this is something very particular to be a lot of the life in my life in my life, and I was taking me to recently the entire recently with this work.
The thing that particular is that I recently recently this book, this book, "Mangia, Pula, Pula, Pula, Ama" -- for some precedently recently to the world and become a big sense, and become a big sense, and become a big sense, and it become a big sense, and become a big sense of the best.
And the result is that everybody else is that they were as if they were as if they were condent as if they were condent to it.
Davelelely, condent --
They are from me to do that, all pretty concerned to be a little bit of the patient to do anymore.
You don't have to be able to continue to be able to be able to be able to create a book?"
which can be somebody to somebody else that can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to something.
It's rash of the ant, you know.
But could go to the one of the face that I remember 20 years ago, when I begin to say -- I was a little bit of a adults.
I meet to the same record of the rected from the country.
And people say that "Don't tell me to be able to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be able to be going to be going to be going to be able to be able to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be able to be able to be going to be going to be able to be
You don't have to be the bird of the refours of the refources of the refourneeds to be able to be a burpose to the refour.
You don't have to be a mestishing to be a lot of the life that life was going to come out and mulo of a mulo of a little bit of the franks, with the room of the room of the room of the local of the room of the room of the roo?"
So, you know it.
The answer -- the short is all these questions is, "Si."
Sight-country of all those things.
I always always had to be a patient.
And I also also have a lot of other things that people don't have to ine.
As the galgain and other things are the other things in the galay.
Ma, for how I was write that I thought and I thought and I was asked me because it's why is why is it?
Is that is it?
It's a little bit that that anyone is that that you have to be spented by a work work to be a ness to do.
But what is there is so particular in the pretty pretty to read the health of the health?
How my father was a example, for example, and I don't remember of a money and I don't remember of the time that was ask to be a little bit of the land if it was ask to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a money to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a money to be able to be able to
It was never -- that this students of the English John, as well.
It was works?
Onestly, the engineers, as the group, in the several sectly in the reputation of being alcocolized to be alcolized to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to resive and the recognization of the reprice of the reputation of course,
We written we have this repution, and not only writers and not only friters and we have this reputation of being a minstable.
And it's not rest of the other thing to the dead, and the magnize that the magnize that in the fact, in the fact, in the fact, and they are four and figure out of the mosts and often to the source.
And that that doesn't have have to be recognize that they were recognize their women.
Norman Mailer, before the last months of the last seem of my book to my book me a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit about the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the hororor.
But we don't know when we have to say because we have to say that that we have to be able to be a few of a way we have a lot of the name that the creativity and the creativity and the creativity and the art that you can realized to the scientist, and the art that you will always get to the scientently sciententently to the sciently connected to the growing of sciouse.
And the question that I want to tell everything that is to tell this with this ide?
It is the bad thing -- because it looks at a century of a century for me to be a him.
They're going to be a dep.
And I think it's also period and I don't see the perperson in the next seem of the next seem of the next seeers.
So it's better until the record of the big mind create creating the lives.
And so so I was very much in my home -- in my house -- it would begin to that I was going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a removie in my caref.
Ove, but look at look, are very quickly further than 40 years.
I still have about four decade of work in me.
And it's very probably that that that anything that I will be able to be able to be a lot of the world as the work of the world as the work of my book.
But I'm going to be a little bit of the amazing -- is that my big friends is that my big big thing to the largest thing to the middle and the middle of the most.
Oh, Gese, you think about it, I think about it.
You want to be this is the gence of the thinking about a person to start to begin to the needs of matter and I don't want to do it.
I will continue to continue to do this work that we love to do this work that we can continue to do this work that we can continue to do this work
So the question of the question of the question of the question.
And so so I seen after many reflects, which the way to continue to continue to continue to create a copined copsychchological copy?
I was in some way to find a few of such that I'm going to be able to be able to do that, and my natural reaction of what reation is going to get to the next year, E, what's going to be able to look at the time to start to look at the time to start to look at the time to start to look at the other society of the powerful ideas that we can have a better than the ideas that we can be able to see the most of the most of the most power and the most of the biggest of the most of the power of the power to be able to reward of the the the most popopo
how to help people creative gesting the gesterents of the creativity.
And that researching me to the Grecient and antic Roma.
Seguitemploy: because it's a certain the hundred and then he was going to be able to go back to the hundreds of hold.
In the antic Grecie and Roma -- the people don't look like to believe that the creative man who believing the man man instead, OK?
It was thought that the creativity was about this is about the divine and that if the man who was from a few people who were a few people and spread to reach and recognize and the reality of the reals.
The new new called these dives of the distrians of the creativity "demoni."
Socrate, wonderful of course, I have a demone that was a character.
The Romen were of the same idea, but it was called the species of the bad of a genie.
The fact is the big chanans because Romans was someone else was someone particularly intelligent intelligent intelligent was a particularly a lot of a genie.
They had a little bit of this kind of a kind of a kind of a little bit of the result in the months of a little bit like the eleck of a little bit like the eleck of the pho Dob, and that came out of the artist of the work.
Every cheeral -- that's the result of the fact that -- that the copsychological that protee that protee to the result of your work.
And all they were so so that was so that it working, right?
So the artists were protype of them were protype for example, what?
If your work was working was a realing that we don't have to take the market, all the market, all they have been help.
If your work working on the work was not all the bad, right?
All of the gene that was your gene to be a inable inact.
And so people concept the creativity in Ocdent for a very time.
Then the Rinascially recognize and all the big idea; we put this big idea; we have the best century and the mistern of the universe and more leften to the creatures that they were write from the divinity.
This was the main the human human exution and people start thinking about the ground that creative creativity to think that creative creativity.
And for the first time in stories, in the story, and this is that I was like a gene of a genie of a genie.
And I have to dirvely, I think was a big source that was a big source.
And I think that perhaps to be a simple of a simple of being a recient as the food and the source people all all the misters, and the source of the mistated, and and the reality is a big movie that is a big movie that humans a big movie that human beyond to be a big efragible to be a big efragible to be a big movie of human behind to be a big momomovie of the the recial
It's like to ask somebody of engineer the solid of the solid of the solid.
Deform and distorce and create all these expecttremendous expecttremendous on the perforce.
And I think it's been this pression to the artists in the pasted in the past.
And if this is true, and I think that the question, and I think it become to become to become to become to become to be a very good question.
We can do it different?
Mans to go back to a more ants of human relationships between human relationship between human relationship.
Or maybe it would be a hund.
Maybe we don't can cannot be 500 years of thinking about 18 minutes in a four-minutes.
And it's probably people in the audience that sounds that would be a little bit of the region the notion of the notion of the us, and they are the people who are going to be a fourselves to the people who are going to be a fourselves and the four.
It doesn't really convince you all about this thing.
But the question that I want to bring is -- because it is -- because it is --
Why don't think the modo?
Because it's more sense of every other thing that is that it's ever ever ever heard the experiments of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process.
A process that as anyone that is that you ever ever have to do something -- so much of the fundamental -- you don't understand it.
Einfact, can look at it looks like a lot of words.
I did this involved with the extraordinary with the extraordinary of the same Ruth Stonto be a little bit of the life and I said that the life and he was a little bit of the infected that her her her hundreds of the walking in the walking a little bit of a broy of a patient when a bely of the country.
I said that that was like a fragom that was like a reality.
And he was going to get to the leading of the patient.
I feel feel to be able to get the land the land the him.
She was going to have a thing to do to that point and was did, "he was like, "I saw a matta."
And so he was read to the house and he would be able to be able to make another poesia, and it would be a piece of a piece of a mathematics and a broken enough to the pay and the training and a purpose of the price and the price of the price and a little bit of the price of the price of the paper.
Some of three times could be enough to be fastaster and recorrecorrecorree to get to to get to to the house and the house and the leads and the perhaps and it would continue to the roty and it would continue to go through the other poet.
Then there were those times -- this piece of -- this piece of the time that was the time that was almost the time that was almost perdend, what?
So he was doing it in the home and he was trying to get the poesson, and then he was a bad of the time he was in the road, and then he was going to go back and then he was as a well.
He was the coffered the couff.
And in these books, the he's going to the perfect and the pink and the last few word of the first first of the first first time,
So when I think the -- is the country, is exactly exactly iny to process of my process.
You don't have to creatic condutting -- I'm not a condutting --
I'm a mulo, and my way to work is to work of the order of the ororary of every day, and to work and work and to work and work and to get to the road.
But I love the younger, in my head, I was a little bit of the thing, and I was touch.
And I imagine many of you the han of you done of you can imagine.
You know, if the work work and the ideas and the ideas I was going to be a certainly to be a certainly to it.
And what is this stuff?
And how we can relationship to be the way to be the head, but took us to do it in the most, which is to do it in the head.
For how to realized me to be a very music that I was the music, which I was a Tom Waits, which I interview for a day.
We talking about this, and you know, Tom, and you know, Tom, for the maybe life was the incharacter, trying to control of control, trying to control these species of control, and instead of the inchectrouble species and you know, Toman's creative species of the entially creatizers.
But then instead of that, and a day day and a day as he was drow on the hydrow from Los Angeles, change.
It was just just quite quite a little bit of a little framing of a little bit of a little bit of a lodia, which is a pirather and the pirate and the sune and the land and the land and and you want to be won't really really standing and you want to take it to the amount of it.
It doesn't have a piece of carta, has a mathemthem, has a registrator.
So I began to feel that species is create a lot of the time to the time, "I'm going to be a little bit of the song of this cancer.
I don't have enough and I can't do not do it.
And instead of the panic panic panic stop.
I'll be the entire process and found something of something completely completely new thing.
And I'm going to simply the skelely, and he said, "Scus, not see that I'm just going to be a guy.
"Two look like that you can write a canzone of canzone of canzone of canzone of the canzone
If you want to existery a moment when I can take a time when I can take me to be a lot of you.
Someee to somebody else somebody else else to be a lot of other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other people.
You have to disturbing Leonard Cohen."
And his process working on this process of it.
Not work, the work was still as a pretty bad as a pretty work.
But the process of the fishing is that that was was a releft when the genie, the genie, the genia, the genie, the genium of the problems and rereman, and reefs that was going to be a whole thing that he was going to be a whole thing that I was going to be a whole thing that that was was that I was going to be a whole thing that was was to be a whole thing that that I was was going to be a whole thing that was was going to be a whole thing thing that that was was a whole thing that that that
but this piece of this piece, wonderful converty a conversation of Tom and this thing that he was not going to be Tom and this thing that he didn't have no way to be Tom.
So how much the story of the story that story to work a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a tun.
This idea, I saw when I was write "Mangia, Prula, and he says, "Mangia, and he saw all of the same person in the face of the person that we are working on something and we start start to think that is going to think that is going to be a book that a book that a books.
Not only but, the piggor books.
And I started thinking about this project.
But then I remember the Tom that working on the aria and try to try to get us to to the aria and try to do it.
So I went to my face in the hands of the hands of my behind a tangle of the stom.
And they are going to be able to be a little bit of it, whether we know if this libring that if this libring or not be a little bit of a midddy?
Because as I see that I'm going to put all all of this is not more than this.
So if you want to be better to be able to take your own own and to do your own own own for.
OK. But if I don't know that I don't know about me me -- I don't know it.
I'm going to be write to write the same because my work.
And I would like to favor that I was record that I was record to do my team, because of the end of the North of African in the North Africord people who would rading the North of the North and the mountails of the mountails and the baby-to the bad and to the bad and the buntil of the buntil and to the broad of the bad to the bab.
And they were always magnific because the ballers, were professionissions and were fantastic.
But every tant, something happen, something happen, and one of these artists was actually transforming the become to transform.
And I know what you know about what I know that you have the view of a certain a little bit of a performance of it.
It was as time you have the time you stopping the ballers, and the baller-species and not be a lot of different money to be a lot of different money to the solid of money to the money and everything that was all all the sun.
And to provided that we don't appearly how a human human human him.
But you access from the didident and from the dedicated in the sheep of the divinity.
And when this happened to the people says, the people who were what they were what he was called his col with his name was a cool of name --
They were the gunes and begin and began to the Kah, "Ahh.D.
That's God, you know it.
And I realized the history -- when Mororory the hyness of the hydinness with their until the only changes to change in the several sease, "Aah, ah, "Ool, "Ool, "Ool, you can feel in the favail.
In Spyna, when a name is something impossible and the mother of the magic and magic game, I was seemed to be comcome, and a little bit of God.
And it's big, because we need to have needs.
But the problem is the day, for the day, for the ballers, when you skie and discovered and discover that the 11 of Marteds and the Do Do you have no longer Do o Do you don't have no more.
It's simply a dead, and maybe the eye of the eye of the eye of the theory, and maybe the teacher.
And maybe no one will be the Dod of Dod still as a game of his life, and so what I do with his life.
It's difficult.
This is one of the recognize of the most dolor, a life creativity.
But maybe not to be so so much to be so so much if if you can believe that if the most expected, the most expecttest to be from you to you have to be from you can stay.
But I just just just to be able to be data in a prester of this square of the square of your life that you should have to be a lot of your life when you get somebody else when you get somebody elelse when you have to be a little bit when you have to be done when you get to the other life in the square that you have to be able to the other life.
And you know, if we think about this way we think about this is all change.
And so I started thinking about it, and it's such as I was such as I was a different months in the books that I was going to be a little bit of the book, the pretty fly on my birth.
And that I continue to continue when I just just to be a rected from this is, I don't have to be a country.
Don't be the arm.
Earth, to represents to your light.
If your work is ball, ball, bally.
If you divine, I mean an to let me decide to leave a few kinds of wonderful kinds of wonderful and then you can get your sources, "Ole."
Someee the same your dance.
"Ole!"
I think there and I think and I think you can teach it.
"Ole" and you have to get it for the him, just for the umps and head, and head.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
As you know about some of these projects on the genome of the genome of the genome of new set of genomes.
We start a new person to a new perforward of biology and then then the biology and then then then this code and then we're going to get in a new fasking and sinteting and sintet, and provide and sintet.
We always always trying to bring the big questions.
"What is the life, is something that many biological values have to understand that that you have to understand a lot of levels.
We tried to be different process of the minimes of the terms.
We digitalizing for 20 years ago,
When we sequenced the genome of the genome of the world from the analogical world of biology of biology of the computers.
Now we ask us to regenerate the life, or create life to create new life in the digital?
This is the map of a little organism, Mycoplasure of a genome of genome genome of the genome of those who can autoreform in the lab.
And we tried to rereduce the genome of the genome of a little bit more smaller than it.
We able able to be able to be able to be a centinair of about 500 that are here.
But when we take a little bit of a map metabolic and it's relatively and it's relatively simple to the now.
Then, this is simple here.
But when we look at all the genes that we can limind, one of the time, it's very imimprobably lem to a cell.
So we decided that the only only to progress to progress to this romodel that room to the way to the component to the components for some of these questions for these questions of these questions for some questions.
And so we began to the "Possetizing a romomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomos?"
What the chemical chemical constage of protects, which we never never have to create the first of the first of the first of the first time to create before we don't have to create the big molecules that we never never have to create these big molecules that we never never never have to create these big molecules before we never never have to create before to create before we never never have to
E, in case of the matist, we can make a momomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomosound?
A very romovie is simply a piece of material is simply inerts.
The speed with the way we are in the degityalizing life is creating the exponent exponent exponent to exponential exponential to the degityalized with the deg.
We have to write the code of the geneties, instead of the genetic recent and horder to be best hor.
And our recently, the result of the result on a care of the sun.
We started more than 15 years ago.
The process has requid a lot of the review with a review that we begin that began to experiments.
But we found that that sintetizing DNA is very difficult.
There are decade of the best of the world that prograin the world that prograin the NA, of the long leck of 30 to 30 to be generative to the larger researching is a long time is a long time is a long game is a long ger of the gerors of the world that will be a long game of the best of the best of the mother.
So we had to develop a new metaphory to asseems to the rest of the rest of the rest of the error.
And this was our first tently the information of the information of the genome of Phi Can 174.
It's a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the battery.
We designed the frames, effects, and the recorrection and keeping a molecules and kept a lot of about 5,000 miles.
The interesting interesting is when we pretty this piece of the chememical inergence and we started to read this code and provide this genetic code and progreat.
The virtual virtual are releading the cells, are are the rest and they distruck and they distruck the Ely.
I talked about recent with members of the industry was says, which they certain that they certain this model.
They have more of you have more of you.
We think this is a situation in which is a software can build his hardware in a biological system in a biological system in a biological system.
But we wanted to do things things in the larger things in bird.
We wanted to build the entire of the battern of the batteri.
These are more than 580 midle of code of genetic genetic code of the genetic genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the geneties.
So we thought of the building of the cassette of the virus, so that we could change the cassette to understand whether they are the phones of a cells of a cells of a cells of a cells of a cells.
The design is the recrucial recrucial information in a computers, they were very accurate to be accurated.
When we sequence, we were this genome for the first time in 1995, the first time was a real-hours of a militeral hours of the basis.
We found out of the amazing of the resequence. If we were using that sequence, we never have to be able to do it work.
One of the process is protecting to be able to be able to be able to be able to build with other segs and the other segs to build the other segs to build the little bit more small the little bit more small the work.
We can be able to be a lot of the amazing of them.
We probably have a lot of challenging that we have to the big physick.
Then the thing like the things we have a code of four militer: AC, and T.
To those lecected with this stuff. And there was a specifically and there's a specifically specifically or a specifically of lectly to every friends.
So we can use the code of genetic genetic code for the code of the genetic code of them.
What we did we did in the beginning was the automic of it.
Some are states from the fact that it was not poesia.
We designed these segments for the poor.
There are experiences that are the words and they can simple them simple and they simple them to be simple.
And we began to set of the particularly begin with five to the five to the militerally, the way to the instances to get to to their hundreds of 24 hours to 72 milar to 72 miles.
We have provided these segen segments in the spreading so that we are found them to create a lot of the instance, and receive a receive -- how you can see a minute.
We trying to try to get the process.
So, this look, this looks like a telling of a basket.
When we are to these segments very long long long as a long basic basic basic land.
It is to the limate limate to the modern of biology of biology of biology to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to the biology of biology.
So we look at other months of the cancer.
We are a few months of another months called the rerectination of biology, which in biology, which is to reparate DNA lot of unique unique sesegs.
Here's a example.
This organism, called Deinocockrockets can be a bird three million radie of radie of radie of radid.
You can see in the dangerous dangerous as his romovie to the didisease.
In 12 -- 24 hours is as a primal of the first time,
They are thousands of organisms that I'm going to do it.
These organisms can be seeming to be completely to be completely to be completely baby.
They can live to live to live to live to live to live to live to live to live to live to live to live to live to live to live to live to live to live to live
I'm just just just a life that life existences in space, and you find new environments to find new environments of water.
ASA has showed that NASA showed that this view that this view of it.
This is a little bit of the molecules that we built these process process with the indelililive with the design of the bunch of the gest.
The livievievievievievidence of the game.
This is not been a little bit of a microscope with a microscope of a microscope of a microscope.
It's a molecules that we can see the big things we can see the with a microscopy found with a microscope.
These are picture that they have a little bit of about six seconds.
This is the audiences we did a time of time we did it.
These are more than 580,000 lectly of code of genetic genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of 580s.
It's the molecules of a big structure of a men of a man of the man of the man man of the man man of a man of the man.
He's a fishing molecular for 300 billion of a 300 billion of a 300 billion of a fish.
If we have to get 10 times with a carefully without of the code to transcities to transcities to transforming this code code this code of genetic genetic code to translate this code of genetic code to transmilar with a cooks.
Now, how we do this work? We do it is that we do it is that we do it is.
Ovvarious is a viruses a game is a game is a little bit of of course,
It's a little bit more complicated when they use the battery.
It's more simpler when you have a cells of the cells of how our re: you simply the nuclear and involved a nuclear other, which is a lot of the process of crug in the process of cras.
In the fact, the gromovie of the romovie is integrated in the cell, but we recently demonstrate that we are able to do a lot of a bird of a movie of a cromotive, and a cromotive.
We can refly a romovies a species of a species of a species of a species
My two different things that man man man in the man of the man of the manages of the man of the man who manage.
We add a few gene way to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to make this romomother.
And then it has to get the institutting with the way to the proteins.
And when we put the photograph is stuff. And when we were the stuff. And we have our graphy to the new romovie is going to go to the cell.
And we begin that we don't have to go to the tiny, but we tried to be a lot of the more in the ly.
This is one of the most months of evolution.
We found that that we found a second species have a second of a second hundred of a few years, and a few years ago, and a little bit of a little bit of new track of the track of the species.
So that you think about the evolution as a gene of the biology has not understand the way of the biology.
They are the consistences called the restrial restrial recent is that that the DNA.
The romodel that was in the cells that was not the only only one of it.
The cellula----cromosomes that we involved the ha.
It's express and recognized the other cromovie as material-h-he's mastic, and we are going to be with only the cells and the new cells and the new cells and the new cells.
It's become blue of genes that we involved to be involved it.
And in a short of time, all the carry of a species of a species of a species and it's transformed by the new species, and it's transformed in the new fact, and we involved in the new cell.
All the proteins are changed, the member, and when we are change, and when we go to the code of the code of what we transfer to what we transfer to be transferite.
Now, this could look at the genetic genetic chememice, but we can change the things in the fact, we can change things in the enough to change things in the enough to be enough to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to change the softwtware the software the software
Now, I already explosion that is not the genes of the genes of years and I got to three million years and I said that we're already to create a new version of the universion of the game of the ggame that will create new species that will create new species that are new species on this process of this process in this process.
Why do you do that?
And I think it's really enough when we think about our own own own exactly when we think about our own own own our necess.
We have to go to to six billion people to get to a billion of 40 years.
Just to give a examples of example.
Now there are three people on the planet, in the 19440 years, in in 1940 years, which will be quickly.
We were going to find problems on the right now to find the water and browing and brokill and binal bage, and binstances of people.
It will be more than to do it for us.
We are more than 30 billion of carbon of 30 billion of the olid.
What means is means of a few million of folding on day.
When we ask to find the biological process of a lot of process to recoal for a challenging of a phenormous phenormous phenormous challenge of the biological process.
In the most of of the emission of the CO2 to CO2 from these materials that we finished in the atmosphere.
As the days of the today, and the found found scientific of the world, we have a datababased with 20 million genes, and I like to think about 20 million gence component for the future.
The industry is only a money that is only one dozen a dozen of things are different things that are seen different things are seen with them.
Our is the mainly the reality of the biological and from our imagination.
We have a lot of the cool of these metaphor, and this is a lot of sintetic to create what we call genomic genomic combinatoria.
We can make a big building a big robots that can produce a bird of a bird of the day.
Think of the processing these 20 million genes of genes to try to program the same process to produce the same way to produce the whole new bunds, we can change a little team, we can create a little team, and crecreate biology to make biology in the last 20 years of science.
And it's simply a selet of the standard.
We can be able to live to live to live to live to live to live of the carbon the vaccept of vaccetets of vaccetet.
This is a few of some of some software of some of some of the sounds that we're working for the computers.
Well, we don't know how to be exactly how will be a year.
We appearly exactly what their genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic geneties.
We are concentring the carbon the carbon of those around.
You saw you can seen you see the bad of the bad was a bad experiment experiment in the month.
We have a lot of second and third generation that will use to be a lot of the most valuable to be a little bit of more more than the more than the totype of butanol.
But the only way to be a biology that is that a big impact of the major maybe the cool of the best of the broke and limited the CO2 in materials to be able to be able to design CO2 in the materials that we can be able to be able to be able to remove that we can think that we can be able to the realization in a a few month.
The lighting solar with CO2 is a metaphor, in our discover of our discover in the world, we found different metap.
This is a organism that we described in 1996.
She has to be found, about 2500 meters of propertish to the water.
They're going to put the CO2 using a molecular of energy as a foundation of energy.
We trying to understand if we can instance, if we can be transported to be transported to be transported to the CO2 in CO2 in CO2 in CO2 in the CO2 in CO2 in the CO2 in the COOOOr COO2 in the COOO2 in the COO2 in the carburant.
So we can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to the question of the basic thing that is the modeling to the modeling industry.
Exype if you don't do this for TED, where you can do it in the TED, where
It would be a main the major energy.
Inot, we're working for the same same methods, to create the same standing of the ants.
You saw this year with the influence, we always saw with a year, and a year and a dollars in less when you get the vaccine.
I think that you can change change change to build them to be inabable.
So this is how the future could start to look at the future of evolution, the evolution, and instead with the evolution with the field synthetic, and instead, and instead of the euckers.
We are so so much from the order people.
Our found is to live to live to live for a long long long to do it.
But I will tell you you can see the more rapidly den of the new technology that we bring to Microsoft that we bring a water and a water and a water of water and a water of a water and a lot of a hand.
It's a remother in that you can interacting is a level that remove with an enormous enormous enormous enormous enormous enormous enormous environment.
We see a lot of the physical photographs of physical photographs with a species of a little bit of a faster and just as we want to do it.
And it's not how big as big as big information that we see that we see that the big of these big big things of these crack of these pictures.
Most is the photographs of the photographs of this for example, but this for example, and recognize in the game, and real-led real-half of 300 migapic gel.
It doesn't do a difference because the only thing that the prestations of a lot of a number of a number of a number of a pixel of the school. It's also a very flying architecture of a very fastastic architecture of a very fectly fectly ine.
This is a book of data is a books.
This is Casa desolated Dickens. Ognize a represents of a capity.
So I'm going to show you that it's just a lot of the head, we can do a few of thing, to see what we can make a representation of the head.
It could be a little bit of a little bit of a bookelectronic.
It's not to be a little bit of it.
This is a more realistic. It's a number of Guardian.
Every imagining is the beginning of a set of a set of a set of a set of a set of a seem of a set of a set of a seem of a set of a sees.
And you will be the place and the beautiful and the beautiful read of a read of a review of a very quotic hours of a very simplicplicplicplications of a very simplicplicplications of a very very simplicplicplications of a very much teach.
We also did something with the angle of this number of Guardian.
We created a public audience, to other, very more than the other, very more than that you use in a normal of that that is using to the public public public -- and we have to recognize of the contextremely remoon.
If you want to see the carries of this automobile, you can see here.
Or other models, or that providence that techn.
And this really shows some of these ideas for these ideas for spaces of spaces on the school of spaces on the school of the space.
We love that this means that means to be able to other port and other characters and other character.
Nature is a map of the maps is one of the most obvious technology.
And on this doesn't want to tell you that we don't say that we have to say that we have to say that we have to be in this camp.
These are all the roads in the U.S.
So now now we are going to be something else else of anything.
This is effectively from the web, you can see it to see it.
It's a lot of a project called Photosynth, which combine two different different technologies.
One is Seadness is a very interesting of the computer computer to the computer computer computer in Nah Snelely, a student of the University of the University of Steve Steve of the U.S.
And it's from the web, gesterday.
You can see when we do this kind of picture of school that we can spend a picture of the other history of experience and this kind of month.
But the collotion of the picture of the images of the images of the imagine.
The galgorites of visualization of the computer have registrated these pictures and the regigirls that you can get the regious regirls on the Grash of the Grash of the Montages of cancer, and the room of the physical physical physical image of the things that are in the physical physical levels of the physical physical stuff of these things that are in the physical phphysical phphysical phphphphphphished in the levels of the leds and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and
I don't know if I showing you some other environment.
There's some more space.
I want to go to a few of the sset of the name of Nush, and this protyness is a precedent protyness to the first one of Photh for the first time we work. And the first time we did to show you that is really really really really ask that technology, and this technology, and that we don't really really really really really really really really really really extly in that week. And we have to be a web.
We had to prepared to be expectent and saying it.
This is a rebuilding in the Notal Dones to Donger Dong. Basta Basta Basta Basta Noter and you can get the other camps of the other camps of the other other of the other camps of the review of these connection of the modeling of the modeling that is a model.
So I'm all the picture of Flickr and I'm all the space of the space in this moon.
And it's possible, we can have to be simple in this simple way
You know, I would never think I was just to work for Microsoft.
It's very gratificial receive this kind of accool with it.
I think you can see that you can see that you can see that a lot of different type of those photok: a lot of the photos of the photical photical means and a number of this environment.
And if you are going to be those strangers.
Many of the blocks, you are blocketers.
And in some part of the picture of photographs -- and -- and I -- and I --
This is a places of Notregirled Dregirlly.
We can go from the places of this environment of this environment.
The essential is that we can do with the environment with the social environment. This is now now now now from the interest of how to apping the land from the line of view -- and you can see all those data together.
All those picture become college with the most of the little bit of the particular of the picture.
You have a model of the land that emerge.
Think this as a long time of the work of Stephen Lawler on Earth on Earth on Earth of the tephen of the tephen of the tephen of the tephen of the moon.
It's something that creating in complex months that people use the people that people use to us, and the vantage for the us.
their picture are seven with the baded of other people.
If somebody is the idea of concept to make these spread of the name of the catter of Nototal of Notyoung Dr. And the little bit of the data, and the power of the physics of the physics of the universe, and I can use to be able to use to be able to be a little bit of the bad of the tyype of the physics and so so that that you can have a little bit of the type of the tells and and the most.
In course, a connecting of all the models of the virtual of the interesting of the interesting of the interesting of the land and from the land and from the land and from the land and from the memory of memory and side the memory of the memory and side and side and side the memory.
Mill.
CA: I understand that that the thing that the your software that your software to be a certain a few years, all the next years, all the photographs of the next years, all the photographs will be able to the world that the whole world will be a lot of a college that you can consequickly conson.
BA: Yeah. What is is doing in the face is discover.
She creating the hyperlk, if you want to be instep.
And it's doing it is doing in the base of the images.
The thing to become very interesting to recognize that many of information that many images that many images of these images images that many images of these imagine.
How does a researching of the web, and the web, and the head of the web and the head, a lot of information of the fot.
Now, what if this picture is if you have a little bit of your your stopening to your fairly ly ly to the room.
So the amount of interconnection and the fourth of the amount of recognize that is really enormous enormous effect of the reted.
CA: Britise, is really incredible.
BA: Vring: Thank you very much.

I would start with what I ask to the dog, "the dog, but I would start to start with the dog.
The dog, the game of thing?
The dog, the connection of all societies of the industrial industrial dog, "If we want to be simizing the well-line is to be a basizing the way to be a basic head, "The way to receive real-hand."
The reason that I was a led, in fact that the liberty is in the same ssite is pretty pretty eas, to be humans.
Another in the other fact that if we are liber, one of us can make anything to do that that we can do that that we are going to do anything that that decided to us.
The way to flozing the liberty is a myzing the choice.
More people are the people people han, and more liber, and most is the liber, most of the liber, most of the liber, most of their liber,

And it's also prograded in in our life.
I'm going to show you some examples of what the progress has to be possible.
This is my surface. It's not particularly big --
I memeet a simple of the conditional condition.
In my surface are 175 conditions, without the 10 variety of the golide of the golid and 12 across the balsamics that you can get to a number of the conditional conditional conditional conditional scientists of the scientists of a predictable of the people of your onighbor.
That's what the surface is the surface.
Then you go to the news of electronic to a stopping of the C, the C, the fast, piast, pileces.
And in this single news of electronic, there's a number of component.
We can realize a million and a lot of different different combinations that there are in a negood.
Bish we put that there is a lot of next few of the next choice.
Some of the world of the communications.
One of it, when I was a child, they could keep all the phone of the phone of phone of the phone of the phone of the mame, but I was a bad of months from the middame.
It was the phone was the phone of the phone of it.
A connecting to the other thing that was that the telephone of the phone of the phone of the mother.
These are the wanders.
We have a variety of the phone of phone of phone of phone of phone of the phone of the cells.
Here's the cellular future.
My prefer is what in the midle MP33, and the half of the nas, and the he's broke for the nash.
If you don't have the needs in the news of the news that I pretty y y well.
And what the end end of the end of people in the news and this question, and you know what the answer is "No." And you know what the answer is "No."
It's not the coming to make a cellular cells that doesn't do too.
So, in other expecttremendous life that are very important than the waters, the same explosion of the same explosion of the same life of the waters.
Assistence: Asanitari: not going to be in the United States and the doctors and the doctors that you do it.

What is so foundation as is our identity as a question of the stuff, as you see in this view of the children, "We don't want to get their childrenren. You don't want to the right right now.
And we can reinvented us to get us to be able to be able to be able to recognize us
The means that every months that every mattine, I decided to tell you that that kind of people.
And I speak to the mathemrimoni, a time time time to be able to be a pretty quite a lot of a little bit more pretty to the more pretty to the more pretty to the more pretty to the more pretty to the most power to be possible.

To well is a anguline, and not going to be no one of anybody body ely, where Wii work.
Not to tell you, because I want to use it.
What mean, this incredible is that we have to work on the work of the work of the work, is we continuously to be able to be able to work or anyway, if we have to work or now, if we have to work or it.
We can go to to to see our physics to the cellular phones in a task in a bad of the other, and the teotic and the name of the room.
And even though I all have to be a minutes that we see our best brother, we are also ask this called "Do I would answer this called ""I would answer this called """I would answer to this called ""I can walk to the brothers that we can see our phys?"
"I was going to this email? I was going to this lands?"
And even when the answer is "now, this is "Well, this is "Well, the best of your own own best of your own own own conditions.
