The last year I showed these slide to demonstrate that calculation glacial glacial glacial dimensions of 48 percent of the United States in the United continent, it's restretching 40 percent.
This is a subvaluable for the problem because it doesn't show it of the ice because it doesn't show the ice of ice because of ice because it doesn't show the ice of ice because it doesn't show the same.
The art glacial calculation is in a certain sense, the heart of global climate system.
You expands of inveries and wind and wind of the summer.
The next slide will be a rapid rapid on the last 25 years.
The ice loaus are drawed in red red it.
As you see it until the blue screen.
That's the ice ice in wind, which is the outside of the outside of the summer.
You can see that the ice type ice ice the ice ice ice perennes, it's like the blood ske, which is the blood of the body.
In 25 years was to the way from this --
This is a problem because the interested in the artren, the art of the art in the ocean art where there are huge amount of carbon that leaves that leaves that leaving the microbies.
Rpack to the totality of the atmospheric warming, that quantity could be returned out of the purch, super-range room of this not return.
In some of the laka little depths in Alaska he's already reboiling from water.
The professored professor, Katey Walter of Alaska has recated team was rected with a team in the winter.
Video: Wow! Al Gore: You're going to be well.
A reason this is that this exchange in the growth of the Greenland of the north of the north
This is a regim.
The levels had never reached with simils.
This is the Kangerlussuawlusaq, in the south of Greenland of the Greenland
If you want to know how the level of the mate level of the ice ice ice ice level, here is where the seak to the seak.
These rents are increasing rapidly.
On the other part of the planet: Antarcts, the biggest block of the planet.
The months the scientists have dichied that the balance, the ice of ice is in negative -- and that Antarctics in the Western Western Western the Western shoot.
It's a six feet of water level, like Groenland in Groenland and in Groenland.
The Himalaya, the third largest block of ice block, you see new laks, who were seeing the lacium of ice ice ice ice ice and glacia.
The 40 percent of the world's population was half of the water from the sket.
On Ande: this ice ice is the source of water water this city.
The carried is increased.
But when it diminutes, it happens to the water.
In California is the snotion on the Sierra is diminished of 40 percent.
The rips are in crisis.
The predictions, like you have rected, are grave.
The growing growing world door a remarkable increasing in the world of incenhouse
The disaster environmental disaster to a returns out of the normal and without precedent.
Four times more number in the last 30 years respect to the 75.
This is a whole thing of unsustainable.
If you look at the historical context if you can see the consequences.
In the last five years we added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the oceans every day.
Look at the point of the oriental Pacific of the oriental parts of the subsidian India, where there's a radical regial in the oceans.
The major causes of global warming, with deforestation, which is 20, is the use of the exforestation, which is the use of the fossil fuel.
The oil is a problem, and the carbon is lost even worst it.
The United States are one of the two countries with the most emissions,
And it was proposed to build a lot of other carbon and carbon
But we're seeing a change of direction.
These are the annulled projects in the last few years and some veries of green realternative realternative projects in the last few years of veries and some of the green realternative projects in the last few years and some of the green few years of the verdisease.
At the way, there's a political lotly political lots.
The carbon industry and oil industry have 250 million dollars in the last year for promote year to promote the carbon for promote year.
This image a picture of reminded me somethings.
Natway, in the Tennesse, where I live a 3.8 billion literally 18 billion literally choories of carbon charcoal.
Maybe you have seen it on the news of the news.
This is the second largest flowing scories in America.
It's happened around Natal.
The natalized publishing one of the carbon industry was this one.
Video: Shype -- Frosty carbon is a half like that.
It's abundant here in America, and it makes our economy.
Frosty carbon is increasing and more clear it.
It's precial, adorables and workers keep it sticks and workers kept the stick.
Al Gore: Do in here is a lot of the West Virginia.
The biggest society on the mountain is Massey Coal. This is Massey Coal.
Video: Don Blank: I'm going to be clear -- Al Gore, Nancy Pelogies, Harry Reid -- they don't know what they are about it.
Al Gore: So the Alleance for the Clima Proteon the Clima has a columped two countries.
This is a one of it.
Video: Ator: Ator: Ators: Ators: Ators:
So we have this priority is invest a great quantities of money in a public effort to make public and confused the versus of the carbon the carbon the carbon the carbon for the carbon for the carbon a carbon.
In fact, the carbon is not spore.
We think it's cleaning -- it's also a good profum.
So not pretty predictate of climate change
Let me do to do it.
Video: Ator: Carbon: Carbon -- you heard about it.
So let's take a game structure at a framework for the carbon for the carbon for clear charcoal.
Straordinary cars are a little white romoreful. But this is the sound of the charcoals.
The carbon is between the main of the main of global warming, but the remarkable technology of carbon is that you see changing everything.
Do a look at the garm, this is the god-clear technology of carbon it.
Al Gore: Indead, the positive alternative skills to economic questions and to that of the national security.
Video: M: The America, is in crisi; the economy, national safety climate crisis,
The film that colleges everyone is our dependence by the combustics of the combustic, like carbon and the important.
Now, there's a new audition for circle solution for circle.
By America: 100-hoods, a dieck of clean holds.
They plan to reput America in work, make America for safer and help the global warming.
Finally, a solution that basts to resolve our problems.
Repower America. It takes a more.
Al Gore: This is the ultim.
Video: It's a gain to America.
One of the faster of bring to dependence by the combustics that kills are killing our planet.
All of the future is here. I mean, a new energy net.
Sowever, 2: Noves investment for places of well.
M: Repower America. It's time to be realist.
Al Gore: A old African old African old African old African old African old line to you, go to the money.
If you want to go away away, go back together."
We need to go away, quickly.
Thank you very much.
The year at TED fect at TED fect on LHC.
And I promise to return to the way it works about how machine.
So I got it. And for those who are the other time wasn't there was no erate, LHC is the biggest scientific experiment -- 27 miles of miles of circumstoms of circumstoms of circumstomb.
His comfortable to rerereck the conditions that were less than a billion under the beginning of the universe -- until 600 million times a second.
And that's just the environment.
This is the machine under.
We photographs Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Big Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Big Bang Bang Big Bang Bang Big Bang Bang Big Bang Big Bang Big Bang Big B.
This is what I work. It's called ATLAS -- it's 44 feet and has a 2-feet and has a 2-feet of 2et feet of 2et feet --
This is a image of ATLAS in ATLAS in building so you can see the proportions.
The 10 settember 10 settember the car for the first time.
And this photographed by ATLAS.
It was because of immense festrating in the control.
It's a picture of the first particles of particles that had done all the around the LHC, entraning in collision, deliberately with a part of the LHC, and spread particles inside the reevator.
In other words, when we see that image the 10 settember 10 settember the machines working -- which is a great life.
I don't know if it was to do it more opposed to this when somebody went to Google and saw that the beginning was this thing.
That means we had a cultural impact over to the scientific impact.
About a week later, it was a problem with machine, it had to these files here -- these films here -- these files sleep.
These films are 13,000 print when machines the machines works at the power.
Now, technicians between you look at the movies and say, "It's not true. It's not true. They're filing too under the sket.
And they can do it because when they're very fastery become the superconvictions of the superconvictions.
So, at least 271 degrees, a carefully temperature in the stars, these files can bring that rent.
In one of the most of the most of ninequips in LHC, there was a fabrication of fabrication of fabrication.
So the files is surgery climbing and 13,000 prints such a resistance of electrical resistance.
This was the result.
Now, this is more impressed, if you think these magnets fish care of 20 tons -- and that have been about 30 centimeters.
They are damaged about 50 magnets.
We had to take it to a take, what we did we did.
We have repristed and add them and add it.
They're now now now now they're returing all of their places.
Enthor the end of marze, the LHC will be new unclear integry.
We're going to accept it, and we expect data or him, and kept the wild, and continue our wind to discover what the universe.
Now, of course, in a certain of course, these accidents reaccepting the dibate of science and engineering to the science and engineering.
I think that the fact that it's so difficult to go beyond the limits, I think it's the value.
I want to conclude with the words of a Ingless, Humphrey Davy, which is involved in inuseful experiments of his pupll, his cleans was Michael Farady, he said, "No is so much dangerous for progress to the progress of the human mind as the rest of the human mind as the rest of the human minds, which is not in nature, and in nature, and in nature,
Thank you.
I want to start asking you to rethink about this -- to be kids, you played with matter matter mattpoint.
While you realize it and resolve them and resolve them and move them and moves, learn in fact, you learn and resolve problems and resolve problems and manipulating relationships.
The space reason is deeply connected to the way we understand part of the world around us.
So, by informing inspired by using the uses of our interaction with physical objects in my counts, and my collaborator Jeevan Kalaniths, I started to ask myself, "And if we use a computer, if we use a computer, instead of the mouse of the mouse as a computer pastredigital that moves on a house of the mouse of the pastredigital to deman,
and it to our pleaseas?
The question was so interesting that we decided we decided we decided we decided to explore the answer to the answer to the answer to the answer to the answer to the answer --
In a few words, a Siftable computer is a big interactive computers as a big.
In a few words, a Siftable computer is a big interactive computers as a big.
You can move them with hands, they can see it in them, "I'm going to feel the movement and have a wireless.
But absolutely objects are physical objects, you can move in fact, they can move in it.
The Siftable example of a new ecosystem of instruments for ecosystem for ecosystem of digital information.
And as they become more physics, and as the way of movement, and as we have more physical and as they become more physics, and as we can explore and the way of move, and as we can explore and different type and different tys.
I'm going to start with some simple example.
This Siftable is configurated for show -- if you including it in a direction, the video comes back to the other side of the other parts of the other parts of the other parts of the other parts of the other parts of the other parts of the back.
These interactive ritrats are consciouss.
If they are interested in what they are interested in what they are the not.
If they are surround it and they can agitate a little bit of it.
If they are surround it and they can agitate a little bit of it.
They also have their movement and incline.
And then we realized that one of the interesting of the interaction was able to use gestures on the data, "versal to the are" as if it was a liquid.
In this case, we have three Siftable configurated as wells of green and I can use them to go to the color, where they midding.
and I can use them for a purpose in the central central central central where they missing them.
If we can recognize, we can put a little bit of a post.
These are also beautiful to learn how language, the languages, the mathematics and playful logical and logical things to try to prove the speed, and see the result results and see the immediately results in the middle of the result of logic.
Now I'm --
This is a Fibonacus that I do with a program of equations.
And this is a word of words that is half between Scarabeo and Boggle.
Pratically, to each turn out to each other in the Siftable, in the Siftable, Pratically, to every turn Siftable, and while you try to get a die on every Siftable, and as a dience.
And then after about 30 seconds remissing and new set of letting and new possibility to try to get out of trying to it.
Thank you.
Here's the children came to the Media Lab, I did it and I gave them and turned it and I turned a video.
They are pleased.
And one of the interesting things about this kind of application is that you don't have to give people a lot of educations.
You just said, "The Componds of words, and they know what to do.
That's what other people are trying to do it.
This is our most giving youngest waste in the right.
It was actually wanted to be raise to it.
They only were five morning for him.
Now, this is a application of a interactive application of interactive cards.
We wanted to build a tool for the appreciation of languages is Felix.
It can put new characters in the scene, and it was reeving their associated with their associated associated
It can put new characters in the scene, and it was reeving their associated with their associated associated
So it's doing it out to the sun.
Video: The sun. It's a little bit of the sun.
David Merrill: Now has taken a treat in the scen.
Video: The treat the year.
By work!
So I get the Sift-schools and put it up closes --
Video: Bau!
-- by inventing their story.
Video: Caw!
DM: It's a story with open, and it can decide he's like it swell.
DM: It's a story with open, and it can decide he's like it swell.
Video: Gola -- I live it,
DM: The last example I have time to show you is a tool, realized to recently and execraftly and exective and execraftly music.
it's a device, realized recently and execk and execk and execk music.
The Seftled here adies like based on the battery.
Each one of these has four different variations, and you can choose what it use.
You can get these sound sound of these sound sound to your please.
And it turns out it by making a sound "sound and a sequence."
These are effects that can control from living, as reverse and the filter.
And it takes a particular sound to be particularly and then including it into it.
And then there are general effects as time and volume, which is applied to the entire sequence.
Look at how it works.
Video: DM: We're going to start a basic in two Sift," we will put it in a series, we get to a series, we add the extent in a series, we add the extent in a series of the same.
Now I put a bassroom line.
Video: DM: World World --
Video: DM: And I'm going to put the movie on the bacteria, so I can control the effect on the face.
Video: I can fast the entire sequence inclining the entire sequencing the whole sequencing of the side of the side of the skin the skin the whole sequence.
Video: DM: And I'm going to add the movie to the basic to give more expression.
Video: I can recombine the sequence.
So I didn't have to planned it before, but I can try and make it more setting it or the cortop.
And now, finally, I can get the entire sequence inclining the entire sequencing the whole sequence.
Thank you.
So as you can see, my passion is building new interfaces of new interfaces of how our brain and corner and corner and corporate how our brain and corner and corner and corporate more and corner and corner to see a new interfaces of the brain interfaces that our brain in and corn
And today, I had time to show you one of the results of this percorporate and some possibility that we try to bring out of the laboratory.
The concept I want to transmitself is coming this new generation of designed objects for interacting with digital media with the digital media in our world in the way we want.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the now of talking to everybody with you.
They're a write write of it.
Scare of books is my professional but it's more of this, of course of course of that, of course of course is more about that.
It's also the love and the fash.
And I don't expect that can change it.
But I said that, something particular is happened in my life and my career, and my career, which has brought me to recalibrate the entire rely recalibrate the entire rely recognized to me with this work.
The particularly thing I recently written this book, this biography called "Mangia, Ama" -- the different from my previous precedented in the world and become a big sense of the world and become a big sense of interaction.
And the result is that everywhere you go to the people are now, the people are convicted.
By -- convicty convict!
They come from me now all worry about and they said, "You don't have paurn to be able to do better?
Don't you fear to write to write for all life without could be able to create a book that can be able to make somebody else that can importing someon?"
which can matter someon?"
It's absolutely reassic, you know.
But it could go worse -- I was a part of the most of 20 years ago, when I started to say to people -- I started to say to people -- I wanted to be a write -- I wanted to be a write of the trick --
I was going to go to the same based by the fear reaction.
And people said, "Don't do you have successful to be success?
Don't you fear that the humiliation of kills you kill you have?
Don't you fear to do this mesture for all life without anything that was going to come up and die on a heart of diving bought to die with the matter of love cate cine?"
So you know.
The answer -- the short answer to all of these questions is, "Si."
I fear of all those things.
I always had to fear of it.
And I also have a lot of other things that people might not have to be injuggling.
As the algain and other things expected.
But as I think about this is writing what I thought and I was asked to get ultimate is why is?
Is it this ration?
It's logic, who anyone who needs to be saved by a job that you feel to do it.
But what is this particular in the impresection creative to make us to recognize about health in a way that other career doesn't do it?
As my father, for example, he was a clear engineer and not remind of a time in his 40 years of activity in which was asked if she was to be walking to be engineer to be engineering capit?
It never was -- that never had to have Johnn, like that?
Don't working, it capit?
Onestly, the engineers as group don't have certainly in the centuries, dlocation of being under the reputation of being under depressive.
We have a writers, we have enough this reputation, and not only creative writers but creative of all generes, we have this reputation of all kinds of being enormously unstable to recognized in the reputing reputing the reputing of all generated.
And it's not rest that look at the trists of the magnific diseases of magnific death, only in the venth century, they die and often for them.
And the ones who don't have suicide seem to be really disddone by their woms.
Norman Mailer, before he die, in the last interview said, "Ogni my book killed a little bit more than a little further." One extraordinary recording about their life.
But we don't bat the time we feel it because we heard these things that are so long than in some way we have been interior and accepted the notion and accepted the notion and the art and suffering the notion and the art and the end, finally, it will always be a skit'll always get to the angood, and it will always be the crazy to the angood.
And the question I want to ask everybody is going to take this ideas?
It goes you have this -- because it looks at it from a centimeter of the distance to me not this supposed supposed to anything that suppose is not going to be good for anything that --
I think it's hodioxy.
And I think it's dangerous, and I don't want to see the next century.
I think it's better to encourage our big minds creative to live.
And I sure that in my case, in my case, in my case, was very dangerous, to began to that feeling to that feeling to the circumstances where I have in my career.
Of course, it's a very young -- it's pretty young --
I still have about four decades of work in me.
And it's very likely anything that I would write to write from the world as the work that was going to be right from the world as I often at my last book.
I'll be squarter, because we all have more or less friends here -- it's likely my greatest success is to my shoulder.
Oh, Gesus, that though!
You know this is the kind of thinking that brings a person to start bing gin the morning and I don't want to do it.
I would keep it to do this work that we are.
So the question becomes do?
And so I was a lot of reflections, which is a way to work to keep on to keep up to the psychological cover, right?
I have to find a few way to find a distance of security of me, which I am writing about what I am written the way that I wrote to get E, as I was trying to get the last year to do it through time, trying to find out the time to look through the time, trying to find out if they could have to see if they could have the best ideas to see if they could have the best ideas to see if they could have the best ideas to see if they could have the most of the best ideas and seeing societies to be able to do that I have to get to get the way to be able
about how helping people to recreative people to recognizing the creativity.
And that research has taken to the ancient Greea and Roma.
Seguitled because it turns out to go back and back back back and then back back back to the skin and then back back to the circle.
In the ancient Grecia and ancient Rome -- people didn't look like creativity creativity to be believing that creativity from humans, OK?
It was thinking that creativity was this spirit of the divine and that came to men from a few diving diving and unknown, for distants and unknown to disconnected and unknown.
The Greeks called these demonstres of creativity of creativity "demons."
Socrate, wonderful of course, it believed to have a demon that elargiving saggeonizing away.
The Romans were of the same idea, but they call the kind of spirit with a genius.
The one is great because Romans didn't think that a genius really think a genius was somebody particularly intelligent genius.
They believed that a genius was this kind of diving entities that had literally lived in the walls of an art in the walls of an art art and that came out of the art and modeling the job of the art and modeling the around.
Extional thing -- that's the distance of which is the distance of the psychological psychological psychological psychological results of your work.
And they knew that was so that was that working, right?
So the antic artists were protected by certain things, like for example, right?
If you have a receptional was not to take all the markite, everybody knew that was helped by this genius.
If your work failure, it wasn't all of your failure, right?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be a inable to be a inable to be a inable to be a inable to be a unable to be a unable to be a unable to be a incapace.
And so people have conceived the creativity in Occident for a long time.
And then Rinascises came and all of the change, and all of this big idea; we put the human being; we put the human beings and no longer and no longer and no longer and no longer and no longer to creatures that write details from divinity.
This was the main of human-rational and people started thinking that creativity creativity came completely from the ished.
And for the first time in story, it began to refer this art as a rather than a genius with a person with genius.
And I have to tell you, I think it was a big error.
I think that allowed to someone, a simple person, to believe that it is like a source, and the surround and the surgerning, unknowing the sources and etherness, unknowing the fragile of a film to be a move or to the human fragile frgible to the human fragipsic responsibility to be like a fragile of human action.
It's like to ask somebody to get to somebody to get the sun.
Deform and distores completely the ego and creates all these ingestive ingestive expectations on the performance.
And I think it's been this pressure to have distrops in the past.
And if this is true, and I think it is, and I think it is, and now?
Can we do it different?
Maybe to go back to a larger understanding of the relationship between humans and creative mystery and creative mystery to a larger understanding of the ancient and mystery of the relationship between humans and mystery and mystery.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we can't cancer 500 years of rational thinking.
And probably there's people in the audience that would be suspects of scientific suspets on the notion of the notion that they follow their projects.
I'm going to be not convinced you all about this thing.
But the question I want to ask is -- why is -- why is that?
Why don't think it in this way?
Because it has more sense of any thing that has ever heard to explain the exasperant.
A process that, as anyone who has ever tried to do something -- so fundamentally, everybody here -- it doesn't behavior, you don't have behavior.
And, in fact, it can seem completely paranormal looking.
I did this meeting with the extraordinary poet, which has 90 years old, but it was 90 years, but it was a poetched for all life and said that during his childhood in the Virginia, working out of the field, and I was working out in the pands of the country's aroung in the countrysic of the countrysize.
He said that it was like a reach further.
And he came rotating to her on the landscape.
It was to get to get to the land under his feet.
He knew about to have one thing to do to that point and it was talking to the point and he was running like a morning.
And so it comes home and it was following this poetise and shouldn't have to be able to make a piece of paper and a cool match, and a pretty fastic in the past, and it would gathere, and it would take it on the page.
Other times couldn't be fasty fast, so corrective and corrective and corrected to get into home and poetry and the poetry rolled through and she would kept through the landscape, and she would kept through the landscape, and he would go to rots, "other poet.
And then there were those times -- this piece never forget -- there were the moments in which was almost losing the moments that was almost losing the time --
So he was running and was looking for the card and was looking for the poetry was looking at the way through the way, and he was going through the right and he was going to go away and said, who was like if you were to handing and the hand and and the office and the office and the off.
He was a poetry from the coda and the coda and the reputting it in his body and the page and the page and the page of the page and the page of the page and the page and the page of the coda and the page and it was taken to his body on the page.
And in these cases, the poetry would be presented on the perfect and intact to the last word to the first thing to the first thing to the first store.
So when I felt -- it's crazy -- it's crazy to my creative process to my creative process.
Not all my creative process -- I'm not a convict!
I'm a muly, and my way to work is to see me at the same time and sould, and and to work and go and go and go and go on and go up and go on and go up and go over and spend on the gotten and and go up and go on and and work on the rop.
But even in my head -- I went to my beginning, I went out against that thing, at times.
And I imagine a lot of you the han made it.
You know, if the work and ideas and ideas and ideas and ideas they could not experience it.
And what is this thing?
And how we can relate to us to do not to lose our head, but rather tex, that make us sanies?
For as I rectly contemporary example I have the Tom Waits, which I interview that I interviewed different years ago for a day.
We were talking about this, and you know, Tom, and you know, Tom, for the major of life was the incarnation of contemporary artist to recognitive these species of creative impulses of creative creative interiors.
But then he was hot hot and a day was driving on the autootion to Los Angeles, he changed all for him.
He was going to be fast, and all of a track track and all of a lodia, which comes in his head as as the inspiration, elusive and to the wise, and you want to him, and you want to spoint, but you don't know how to take it.
It has not a piece of paper, it has no mathematic.
So it began to feel this kind of old old old old old old in him, "I'm losing for lose and I'll get husbone of this song, and I'll remarry it from this song canzone of this song.
I'm not good enough and I can't do it."
And instead of go to the panic stop.
I'll go to the whole mental process and did something completely new process and did something completely new thing.
I'll look at the sky and said, "Scus, you can't see that I'm driving my sky and said, "Scus, you know,
"To look like you can write a song hor?
If you really want to exist, it goes to a moment when I can take care of you.
Altriments, you go to the important.
You to disturbing Leonard Cohen."
And his working changed after that.
Not the work, the work was still as dark as it turn.
But the processing, and the fish anth, which was released when the genius, the genius, the genius, the geniusing it was nothing else and remaking it from the time and remaking it had to be a whole thing that had to be a interior and returned out that had to be a interior and back back back to it.
but well, this piece of bizarms a conversation between Tom and this thing of the Tom and this thing strange and external conversation and external thing that was not Tom.
So I felt that story began to change a little bit of the way I was working and saved me a time.
This idea, he save me when I was writing "Mangia, Prega, Ama," and falls in one of those despite in which we all have when we are working on something and we don't have to think and began to think that will be a disaster, which will be the worst of worst book.
Not just bad the worst written writting.
And I started to think about designing this project.
But then I remember Tom who talked to the air and trials.
So I went to my face on the hand-right and I would say my comments to a angle across the room.
And I told you, "You're both to you, both both you know that if this book not going to be brilliant, not going to be brilliant, right?
Because as I see I am going to put all of that.
So if you want it to be better and do your part.
Okay. But if you don't know it, I don't have to be cool.
I'm going to write the same because my work.
And I want to favor that was recorded to me to do my part, I recorded to my part, because of the end is -- in the end of the North Africa -- secopy people were done for the dances of the long dances and sacred for the dances and sacred to the sacred and until hours and until hours and to the albe.
And they were always magnific because the ballers were professionals, and they were fantastic and they were fantastic.
But every single time, it was going to be a translated artists become in reality in reality.
And I know what I know about what's talk, because I know that you have all seen everybody, a lose like that.
It was as if the time stopped and the ballery walking through a kind of landing and was not doing anything from the solid, and it was not doing anything from the solid, but all of them would be done in the sun, but all of the time.
And suddenly not appears just like a human human human
But it comes from the behind and under under the divinity.
And when this happened -- when this happen, people knew what he was called his name.
They had their hands and they started to sant, "Ah, Dod God, "Ah, Dod God, God,
That's God, you know.
Curiosa story -- when the Mors invaded the south of the Spana, they took this habited habited in the centuries of the walls of "Allah, Allah, Allah, oh, what, "Okah, who's age, which you can still feel in the corrects."
In Spaper, when a artist has done something impossible and magic -- "Oh, oh, magnific -- -- "Oh, magnific -- and I me," incompreciable -- a fool of God.
And it's great because we need.
But the problem comes the day down, the ballery ballery states, when you see and discovering that are the 11 of Martedday and the fall of the way there is no longer goes down and discovered it down.
It's just a mortal with the whatever, and maybe it will never be able to get to that alteacher to that hear height.
And maybe no one cancer the name of God while he still goes with his life?
It's hard to it.
This is one of the most dolorous reconciliations.
But maybe it doesn't have to be so angood, if you can not believe -- if you can not believe -- that the most extraordinary to you, that the most extraordinary to yourself as well.
But it believed you that you have to be done by a imaginable imaginable, in the squisite life that you have to get somebody else when you fine.
And, you know, if we think in this whole whole change it.
And so I started thinking about it, and it's sure as I thought for different months during the work of the book of the book of the book of the book of my big book that published my great deal with my big deal with my big deal.
And what I have to keep on the electric when I feel electric feeling from this is, not afraid to be paper.
Don't scorping the work.
He representing you to represent you to you get apart, whatever can be.
If your work is ball, ball, it is.
If you get the divine, assumption to leave some kind of a wonderful time to leave some kind of wonderful time through your heaps, then "Ole!"
Altriments, you know, you do the dance.
And "Ole!" to yourself.
I think and I think it's got to teach it.
"Ole!" to yourself, even for you, even for he's love and head, and heading the same.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
As you know I've talked about some of these projects on human genome, on what it can meaning and discovering new set of genes.
We're now starting a new lose of it, we started digitalizing biology and now to go from that code and now to the digital code, we're entering a new biology, designing and synthetic and synthetic lives.
We always tried to take a big questions.
"What is life, it's something that many biological biological biologists have tried to understand various levels.
We tried different approach, reducing it to the minimes of terms
We're digitalizing by almost 20 years hour.
When we sequenced the human genome is to go from the ananalogic world of biology in the digital world.
Now we asked us to regenerate life, or create new life from this digital?
This is the map of a little organism, the Mycoplasma genitalium, which is the smallest species in the smallest genome of those who can autoreplicate in laboratory in the laboratory of the map of the laboratory of the movie.
And we tried to reduce the genome to create the genome to create a little bit more smaller than that.
We are able to eliminate a hundred genes of the about 500 who are here.
But when we look at his map to its metabolic map of the metabolic map to the notion.
Creat them, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminat, it's very unlikely to get to a live.
So we decided that the only way to progress to progress this chromosomes in a way that we could actually modify to defy some of these fundamental questions.
And so we started the wind of "Post we synthetic a cromom cromother?"
Can it chemistry to produce these big molecules that we never have to create before that?
And in case of record, we can make a cromoso-mak?
A chromosome, it's just a piece of chemical material inert.
The speed with which we are able to digitalizing life is growing up at the exponential.
Our capacity of write the genetic code, progress dep, but it's better slowing.
And our results results the results the door to a exponential.
We started 15 years ago.
The process has requires a lot of past, beginning with a biothic revision before we started the first experiments.
But we found that synthesizing DNA is very difficult.
There are thousands of cars in the world that produce small segments of DNA, of the 30 to 50 to figure out there and it's a degenerative process is degenerative process is longer longer than the segment is longer longer to be degreater for us to recognize it.
So we had to develop a new metod to assembling these framps and correct the errors.
And this was our first attached to particular information of Phi genome of Phi X 174.
It's a little virus that bacteria.
We designed the fragments, effect, effectured the correction of the errors and get a DNA of about 5,000 letters.
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemical material and we put it in the bacteria, and we put it in the bacteria have started read this genetic code and produce the virtual particles virtual particles.
The particles are virals released by cells, they went back and have been released by the E.
I talked about recent recent members of oil industry saying that they have certainly understood that they have certainly this model.
They have more than you.
We believe that this is a situation in which software can actually build the same hardware in a biological system.
But we wanted to do things in big.
We wanted to build the whole whole chromosome.
It's about 580 miles of genetic code of genetic code.
So we thought of building it in the size of virus, so that we could change the cassets to understand what the cassets are a living cassets of a living cassetcell,
The design design is crucial crucial, and if we start with digital information in a computer, these have to be very accurate to be very accurate to be very accurate to be very accurate to be very accurate to be very accurate to be very accurate digital information in a computer, these have to be very accurate to be very accurate to be very
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 19995 to the first time in 1995 to the standard was a midle for 10 miles a basis.
We found out of that, resequencing, 30 errors. If we were used that original sequence.
A part of the process is designing to design segments that you have to be smooths to all the other segments of 50 sets to build underunits to build underunits to build underlying the little bit of the tiny working together.
We try elements to the only one here.
Probably you read that we read about the great.
Think it like this: we have a genetic code, the four letter: A, C, Gs and T.
Three of those letting with the multiple codifies, and there's a specific order of lects, and there's a specific order.
So we can use the genetic code for words, though yourself.
What we did about the beginning was automotion was automotion was automotion of the beginning was automotion was automotion of the beginning was automotion of automobile states.
Some of the fact that it was not the poek.
We designed these segments for simply simply unique with the entire history.
There are the people that rept and they put them and put them and put them up.
And we started to assembling the parts, starting with five to seven miles of seven miles a seven miles of 24 miles of lectly letting to them to get 72 miles to get 72 miles to 72 miles a letter to 72 miles literally get to 72 miles a literally
And we produced these segments in fact, so that we can sequence, so that we can sequencing that we're trying to create a remarkable procediment and that we can see in a minute.
We're trying to automatizing the process.
So this seems the tabels of a basket.
When we get to these draw very long long as 100 miles more than 100 miles will not grow the E.
It's got to the limited instruments of molecular biology.
So we have to look at other mechanisms.
We knew about another mechanism, called "recombination of homology, which in biology to replip the DNA to rept the DNA to rept the segments.
Here's an example.
This organism, called Deinococcus radiodurans, can absorbing three million radiation rad to the radiation.
You can see in the so-danger as his cromosomes became up to the destroyed.
In 12 -- 24 hours is reassembled as it was before.
They are thousands of organisms that are able to do it.
These organisms can be able to be able to be able to be able
They can live under the vacuum as well.
They're absolutely certain life in space and you get to find new environments of water.
Actually, NASA showed that this has shown that this has shown that this has shown that this has shown that this lives.
This is a image of the molecules that we built process, just using this process, just using the lievidence with the design appropriate to inserious of insearch with the search of the molecule that we built with the research processes,
The lievid lievil.
This image was not taken with a electronic microscope, but with a microscope rular with a rular microscope with a rular microscope with a regible microscope with a regist microscope with a regist with a microscope microscope with a regible microscop.
It's a big molecule that we can see it with a microscope with a law.
These are photographs that cover a period of about six seconds.
This is the publishing that we did a little time ago.
It's about 58,000 letting genetic code of genetic code of genetic code.
It's the biggest molecule of a structure that ever created by man.
It's got a weight molecular on 300 million people.
If we spent with a 10 paper, it would like 142 pages, it would just take 142 pages to turn this genetic code of this genetic code of a genetic code of a code of 10 pages to get this genetic code of a careattless to us to transck this genetic code of a genetic code of a code of the genetic code of this genetic
Now, how do we do it work?
Of course, we trust a virus is a girl.
It's a little bit more complicated when you use the bacteria.
It's simplest when it's a cell of the eucariot as our real eucariot as our reck and insert a little bit of the cloning and put another another one of the cloning process cloning cloning the clonation.
In the bacterial bacterial araea is integrated in the cell phone, but we recently demonstrated that we are able to do a complete trapience of a complete cromosomes from one and to active it from a cell and to active it.
We can have a cromosome, a microbial species from a microbial species.
The two are different than the tough men are driving topis.
We add some gene gene in a way that we could decide what choosing for this chromosom for this chromom for this chromom for this chromom for this chromom for this chromom for this chromom for this chromoso.
The one one has skilled with the inforced in the way to kill all the proteins.
And when we put it in the cell was stuff -- and you just appreciate our choicato-the-to-crowing cell in the cell phone is gone inside the cell.
And we started to think we couldn't go to become to beyond it, but we tried to get over there.
This is one of the most experience mechanisms of evolution.
We found that many species have added a second or a third cromosomes from a few half away from a thousands of new trates to that species.
So who think about evolution as a gene of gene as a gene that you have not understood much of the biology has been able to have a lot of biology.
They are the inner of restrial restrial of restrial restrial digerism.
The chromosome, it was in the cell cell as it was a little bit of it.
The cell phones the cromosomes that we have insert --
It's expressed, and it has recognized the other cromosome, it has masticked the cell and we have recocovered with the cell and the new cromom and cromom cross the new cromom and cromom crows.
It's became blue because of the genes we have insert.
And in a short of time, all the characteristics of a species are going to be losed in a new species of the software that we put in the cell.
All the protein are changed, and when we read the genetic code genetic code genetic code genetic code of what we transfer to what we transfer it.
Now, this might seem like genetic, but altering the software as a software can change the things in maniery enough of the sustain.
Now, I've been explained that you don't have to talk about genesis -- but of progress to go from three million years and a half years of evolution, and I said that maybe we're going to create a new version of Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosion in the digital process of digital process of the digital process of the digital process of genese.
Why do that?
I think it's enough of obvious when we think about our needed necessity.
We're going to go from six billion and a half billion people in the next 40 billion in the next 40 years.
I was born to give a example -- I was born in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for each other, in 194, in 1940 years, there are going to be four year.
We're going to find food, and clear water, water, cleaning and cleans, and bas, and bency and half a half billion people.
It's going to be more hardest for nine billion.
We get more than five billion carbon carbon and 30 billion bars.
That means a half a million bars a day.
When we try to find biological processes to find biological process to replace to replace them, it will be a huge challenge.
We have to keep it to keep the whole emission of CO2 emission of CO2 from these materials that finishing in the atmosphere.
At day, thank you for scientific discoveries in the world, we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I like to think that are the designed components for the future.
The electronic industry has only one dozen about components, and think about how many different things are coming out.
Our limited in biological reality and our imagination.
Now we have a technical land of this synthetic metods of synthetic metoh.
We are able to build a big robots that can produce a million chromosomes at a day.
Think of process these 20 million genes or trying to get to optimize the processes to make the processes to make a drugs, and vaccines, we can change a little team, and create biology and create biology in the last 20 years of science.
And it's just a standard.
We can choose for possibility of survival, production chemistry or carbons, production of chemistry pursue vaccines of vaccines --
This is a few software software programmed to be able to set and design species and designing species and designing species on the computer.
Well, we don't know necessarily as they will be not.
We know exactly how they do it is their genetic code.
Now we're concentrating on the reality of quarter generation.
You see that you see that you can see ethanol from grand was a matter experiment in the wind.
We've got a second and third generation that will be used to be pretty soon as well-buroning sugar carbest as the either types of butanol.
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without major major major of the food and limiting the disease, and the disease will be transforming CO2 material, we are working for cell to design cells that we are working for the purpose that they can reach this discover, and we could have the prime carbon of those carbon about 18 months.
The solar light with CO2 is a metodom -- but in our discoveries in the world, we found different metodi.
This is a organism we described in 1996.
It lives in the ocean deep about 2500 feet feet of the water to the water of water.
It res the meter from CO2 using molecular molecular energy as sources of energy.
We're trying to understand if we can insonate CO2, which can be transported by making your burons, convert that CO2 in carbant, to drive this process.
So the short we could be able to increase what the basic questions about the basic questions is Not -- we have the dest goal to replace the entire industry -- we have the entire industry.
Exactly. If you can't do it from TED, where can you do that?
It would become a major fundamental energy.
Also, we're working for using the same metods to create vaccines to create vaccines of creating vaccines.
You have seen this year with influence, we're always behind a year and a dollar and a dollar and a dollar and a dollar.
I think that that you can change build vaccinable in ancient ancient.
That's how the future could start seem to change it, now, the evolution, access to evolution with synthetic bacteria with synthetic bacteria and infinally cells eucarios.
We're so much to be so from the best people.
Our purpose is to make a long way to try to make it to try to make it. Thank you very much.
I will see the most quickly possible, the most possible, a fundamental work that we have taken to Microsoft in the Microsoft in the following watching in the Microsoft in the Seadragon.
It's a environment in which you can interact is a local level, which remote with a huge quantities of visual data from visual data --
We're seeing a lot of gabyte photographs with a kind of digital zoom and continue, for a speed, and a speed of a speakery to be able images as we want to do it.
And it doesn't matter how big the amount of information that we see -- how big these data data or images.
Most of digital photographs -- but this for example is a provide from Bilibrary of the Congress, and reents re-entered photographs and reents in the gamm of 300 megam.
It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that limited the prestations of a system like this is the number of the screen on your screen in any moment. It's also a very flexible.
This is a whole book internal data of data not images.
This is the Dickens. Every desolated,
So to show you that it's about a head and not images, we can do something like this, to see what it is about a reality of a reality of the head, not a photo.
It could be a little artical way to read a electronic book electronic book electronic book for a little articks.
You don't have it.
This is a more realistic example of The Guardian number of The Guardian
Each image is the beginning of a section.
And it will really give you the pleasure and the beauty experience of read read the version of a quotidian or a quotidian of a quotidi, which is a lot of half half a lot of half half a lot of half a version of half a lot of half a quote or a quote
We also did something with the corner of this number of Guardian to Guardian
We created a high-resolution to high resolution -- much higher than what it uses in a normal published -- and we put you in the extraordinary content -- and we put you in the extraordinary to the extraordinary resolution -- much higher than what it has been able to be a normal ad.
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile, you can see here.
Or other models, or even specific specific specific models,
And this really demonstres some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on the screen on the screen on the screen of these ideas to be able to expensive.
We hope that this means to put up and other pop-up brand other cclimbs, not to be necessary.
Of course, the map of obvious applications for this kind of technology for this kind of technology.
And I don't want to lose the time, if not to say that we have contributes to give it in this field.
These are all the way in the U.S. It is obsovoved in NASA.
So we're going to go to something else.
This is actually actually from the webs; you can go to the webs; you can see it it.
It's a project called Photosynth, which is two different technologies.
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual research of the U.K. Snavely, a student of the University of Washington, with the Sevelki Sevelki Resear. And in Research. Seeliski Research.
And it's from the web, I gestished.
You can see it when we do this kind of screaming this kind of screen and have this kind of experience and have this kind of experience to multiple resolution to multiple.
But the collocaon the space of images here has actually actually an meaning.
The algorithms of visualization of the computers have recorded these images together, in the real way that image -- all the neighborhood in which imagine -- all the neighborhood in the songs of canawide -- have been taken on the patterns of a slide-show show of a slide-show of a slide-show -- and these things are all the space of the space of space in space of the space of the space of the space of the space
I don't know if I have time to show you some other environment.
There's a lot more space in the space of space
I want to go directly to one of the original data from Noah-- and this comes from a precedent prototype of Photosynth-scoring technology -- to show you what we did for the first time -- to show you what I think is really the key to show you what I think about the technology -- and it's not necessarily to the environment, and it's not necessarily to the environment, and it is not necessarily so much of the evidence that we have done in the website in the website of the website.
We had to worry about legal and saying.
This is a reconstruction of Notare Dunner Dunced images from Flickr. Basta digitating Notare Duntaking images of types in Flickr. And you can get imagine of the camp, and in fact, and you can see a picture that is discovered a picture that is a image that it's a pattern.
So they're all pictures from Flickr and have been connected to space in this way.
And it's possible to navigate in this simple.
You know, I would never have thought of finally working for Microsoft.
It's very gratify to recognize this kind of belong.
I think you can see that it's a lot of different kinds of different kinds of different kinds of focuses to the SLR, a professional photos in the SLR, a meaning of the environment.
And if I try to try to try to try to search the strange.
Most are a lot of them are blocked by doing this, etc.
And somewhere a few of photographs -- etcolor.
This is a Notre Dunmyself recorded correctly.
We can go from the places of the physics of this environment.
The essential point is that we can do with social environment. This is taking from the entire memory of how the Earth, from the entire of viewing the ground, and you all those data together.
All of those photographs become connected together, most of the same.
You have a model of the land that is emerg.
Think about this as a model of Stephen Lawler on Earth Lawler on Earth
It's something that grows in complexity as as people using it to the people use.
Their photographs are marcare metadved by other people.
If you get to somebody is contrash all these kinds of seasing the name of Notare saying the name of Notre Damday, and I can use all of those data, and I can use the data, and I can use the point of all those data, in that universe, in that universe, in that universe, in that universe, in that universe, in that universe, in that universe, in that universe, and to have a social experience of a social experience of the kind of a social experience of a kind of a social of a kind of a sketers.
Of course, a consequence of this is the extremely elaborated virtual spring of the Earth, rather than the plane and images -- and by images and images in the plane and images -- but by the memory of collective.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I realized what your software will connect us to do is that at a certain point, in the next years, all photographs shared everyone in the world will be ready connected to anyone in the world will be practically connected together?
BA: Yeah. That's what it's doing is doing is going to discovered.
It's creating hyperlins, if you want to be in images.
And it's doing it in the bottom of the images of images.
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the reck of information that many of these images can have a lot of these images possibly education of these images possibly incharge of these images can have a lot of these images that are becoming.
As when you make a research of images on the websentence and the web on the web has a lot of information about the pictures of the photos.
Now, what happens if that picture is a picture of your photos is going on on the photos that pictures if that picture is a picture of your photos on the photos is connected to all your photos on the photos of your photos at all of your photos down?
So the amount of interconnection and the amount of interconnection, which is really enormous amount of the retable connection. It's a classic effect.
CA: Blaise, it's really incredible.
BA: Thank you very much.
One of the major when you travels travels and one of the ethnographics is power to live between who has no anti-traditions, between the green traditions, the truths in the wind of the place -- touching the place of the place of the place and to the plants.
Basti is thinking that slightly the slide of the Lattea, or that the myths of ancient antians are still taking significantly significantly of meaningful meant to respire the respire respire respire respire the importance of the anthropologi, and that idea that we live in the world in which we live not exists in a sense of the world we don't have to be reality, but it's just a model of reality.
the consequence of a particular choices that our stirps has done that, well or myself or malso, many generations ago.
And, of course, we all share of essential tratics.
We all have to be born. We all produce it.
We're dream of the beginning.
We have to deal to deal the inexorse of mort; it doesn't surprised us and balliam, and ballim --
We all have a art of it.
What the rhype is the retest of the song, the rhythm.
Not matter to the forest of the Borneo, or following the Haiti, or the Haiti, or the Warrierriers of Kair in Kenya settried Kenya settered in the Sahara.
He was my companied in the desert of journey in the desert in the desert in the valleer of Qomolangma, on Everest, the demother of the world.
All of these populations teaching us that there are other ways of thinking about it, other ways of thinking, other ways of thinking, other ways of moving in the world.
And if you can get a second, it's a concept that can give you hope.
Again, my own own life of cultures in the world create a spiritual life and cultural life and cultural to be the planet and is important for the bend of the planet so the well-being of the planet as biosphering biosphere.
And you can think of this raise cultural ethnose as an etnose and you can define the ethnose the ethnose of all the concepts of all the concept, inspirations, inspired in the human consciousness to be from the human imagination of the consciousness to the consciousness to the consciousness of the consciousness to the human aquare the equipment.
The ethnose is the fantastic remon.
It's the symbol of what we and of what we can be in as inquisist species
And as the biosphere was gravely consumed high-walked away to the ethnose and purch.
No biology, for example, it would say 50, it would have been or on the outside of the outside of the outside of biological diversity because it's falsy, or -- in the most calculation -- in the most of biological diversity -- that is not near to the most optimistic diversity.
The indedefine of this is, of course, the language.
When you were borns 6,000 languages on this planet.
A language is not just by a voice of a voice or from a series of rules of rules of rules.
A language is the spray-human spirit spirit of human spirit spirit of human spirit spirit is the human spirit of the human spirit spirit of human spirit spirit language.
It's the half with which animo is in the material of every culture comes in material.
English is a forest forest of mind, a spiritual system, a spiritual system.
And of those 6,000 languages, as as we sat Monterey, at least half the half of the horecks.
They don't have a teacher to children, which means that you want to say anything, which is already died.
What is more than the sad of being fly aware of the skin the language of a language of a language of transmitted to the wisdom of the children?
This is a few weeks have been a few few years of the world every two weeks of the world every two weeks a wall, and brings a walls of a ancient language in the mbroken language.
And I know somebody of you will tell "Is it not better like that?
The world would not be a better place if we were all the same language?" Bensym, then we talk all the same language?"
Let's talk about it.
You're going to cover a track what it means you can't talk about your language.
Today would like to do a journey through ethnosfer.
a little journey in ethnose ethnose of what we're losing down.
Many of us forget that when I say "different different ways of exists of existing exists of exist.
Let's take for example Barasana, in Amazonia in the settrill, the population of the anagony, which creates to the mit of the sacrist.
It's a popular popular that it's not able to distinguishing the blue color, because the celests is identified in the forest, which is identify to the popul.
They have a strange language and a language rule, "English language, "You have to be a language that talks about a person who talked about a different language.
All of this has radicated in the mythological past, all of the way is that in these families are spot or seven language in which is a seven language because of the mysts of a language.
They listening to listening and then start talking about.
Let's take one of the most interesting tribes with which I lived in the Waorans of Ecuador of Ecuador who had the first contact in 1958.
In 1957 missions have tried to a committed contact a fact that
They made from the site photographs who were returned them in a few friends, dimentically returned out that this population of the plug forest, and that population had never seen anything about birth.
They have been raised the photographs from the land, they have a shape or a shape or a figury and they have been divole, they have killed that was diavold, and they killed the five of the mission with the lands.
But Waorans don't knew the strange souldn't ke.
They kill a lot of them.
The five percent of the mortality was because of them was because of them is
We are risalitites and we found two natural houses, and when we insisted for knowledge and when we insisted for knowing one of them was dead, and then they have been dead, and then they kill it him.
The cactors were able to recognize the animal-apass and recognizing the species of the species.
In the first 1980s, it was assigned a very interesting when my professor when my professor of Harvard a few few years I wanted to go to Haitites to the basic societies to the basic societies and Tonton Macoutes, and I can make me on the basic power and to immyself ves.
To give a sense of miraculy, I should have been understanding culture Vodoun and that Voodom is not nera.
It's pretty much of a complex metaphysics of the world.
Very interesting.
If you ask to tell me the big religions, what would say to me would say to me about the world, what would I say to me?
Cristianesim, Buddddhying, Ebraism, etc.
A continent is always left out, and thinking that Africa sub-Saharan Africa-Saharan Africa-Saharan Africa, and the Voodoo is not that the distilled of these religious concepts in the slavery of the slavery deeply to the slavery.
What makes your interesting is that you have a voodom is the intense of life and death.
So you have to live the spirits.
And the spirits can be invocked by the Great of the dance and replaces replaced the rhythms and replaced the sould, in the way that for a short of the way that for a short is the following the dio.
So thodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodom to talk about God.
We go into the temple, and we become God."

In fact, the XXXXXXXX--year-old wars or the wars of the wars or innovations or its technological innovations or innovations in which we have been stopped and we have been habbraced and we have been actively accepted the distruction of the planet. Now the issue is not the change.
All cultures through the century are involved in a dance for new possibility of life.
And the problem is not technology.
The Indians Sioux doesn't stop to be Sioux when they put from the side of the Americans have no brought to be Americans when they put it from the hororder.
It's not the change or the technology that they threats the ethnofer. It's the power.

I took this photographs on the north of Bvin Bvin Border when I went to hunting with Inuit, and this man, Olay; he told me the wonderful story of his grandmother.

And finally, I think it's pretty obvious obvious at least to the people who have been in these remote areas of the planet, make such that they don't have remoted.

Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that hope to be called other than you have heard and provide and provide some collegalizing some collegalized them in the case not noum nost.
I want to start with what I call "the office dog.
The office dogm dogm of thing?
The official dogm of all society society is the Western societies, "If we want to massive the well-being of our citizing citizing the well-being of the city to be to the freedom,
The reason for human beings -- in the fact that freedom is in the fact that liberty is preciout, essential for humans.
On the other is in fact, if we are free, each one of us can account for just connection to do everything that massive our well-being, without any of our well-being, no one that decide in our name of our own own well.
The way to massimizing freedom is to myzing choice.
More choices people are libere, more freedom is their freedom, it's their freedom, it's their head.
And this is so deeply radicated in society that nobody would be dreamed in the society would be able to put it in the two-bought society that would be dream.
And it's also deeply radicated in our lives.
I'm going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible.
This is my supermarket. It's not particularly big time.
I allowed a simple note on the saved condition.
In my supermarket are 175 conditions, without contaring 10 variety of olivariety and 12 acets acets that you can buy for you to a huge number of enormous conditions, no one of the 75 already already to the circumstance of 15 already already already to the skin your degree of your degree.
That's the supermarket.
And then you go to the snegoti's snegoti's snegotiat, CD, slettor CD, radio, plast, paper.
And in this single snegotial of electronic components of electrons
We can make six million and a half million different combinations using the components that there are in a only one negotid.
You have to admit that there's a lot of choice.
Other of the world of communications --
One times, when I was a child, you could get all the service telephones of wish cell phone that they were forned by mamazed Bell.
He was rewooked the phone, you don't buy it goes.
One consequence of that, in the way, it was that the telephone doesn't stop into the mobile phone is that the phone doesn't rop.
These times are gone.
So now we have a variety of telephones, especially in the cell phones in the cell phones.
That's the future.
My favorite is the MP3, cut, cut, and forces in the middle of the nose for the cras.
If you don't have seen in the house store in the house stop, you're going to pretty much reverse it will be pretty much reverse than it will be pretty much in the case, you have seen in the house negotid.
And what happens is that people get into the negozol and does this question. And you know what is the answ? The answer is "No."
It's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn't make it too much things.
So in other aspects of life that are much more important than water the same explosion of choice.
Assistance, health is: It doesn't happen, in the United States and the doctor and the doctor and the doctor of what you have to do.
Instead, you go to the doctor, and the doctor saying, "Okay, we could do A, or B" and these risks." And these riskss," "Bs have these risks.
You say, "Dr, what should I do?"
And the doctor says, "It has these goods, and this answer and these risks."
"What do you want to do?"
And you can see it was like, "Dotor if she was to me, what to do?"
And the doctor, "But I'm not le."
The result is called the malato," expression that it makes it look like a beautiful thing,
But in fact, it's not a shift and responsibility to take decisions to take decisions from something, what, it's the doctor, and somebody else that doesn't know anything -- and so in not in the ideal conditional to take decision, and so not in the ideal to take the patient deciding to understand the patient.
There's a marketing marketing products drugs, I direct to people like me and you, if you think about you, and if you don't think it has no sense, that we can't buy it.
But if we can't buy it it, because if you published them to bought them?
The answer is that they want to the doctor to change the doctor to change the recise of change.
And so fundamental of this is the integrately horever is a choice, as you see in this view in this view of the children. They will be able to make their sex moment to the right moment of the right now we need to invent.
And we can reinvented us how many times we can reinvent.
The means that every morning to the answer -- you have to decide that kind of people wants to be able to be there.
Rempt to the family and matrimoney in the common prospective for anyone for anyone for anyone for anyone for anyone to the most pretty possible, and it was going to be the pretty possible.
The only true is it with then, not go to it, and even what to do with that.
Ogy, it's really to play.
I mean, very smart students and I do do the 20 percent less of work in less of a time.
And not because they're less not bad because they're not less because they are less diligent.
But why I'm going to ask you, I mean to ask me or no? I should be going to do that?" I should do that?"
"I should be a little bit more tardie? I have to think before the song?"
They're interrogatives --
And they try to answer these questions, even if this imply doesn't completely the compites that are and not get a good voice to my exam.
And they have to do that. They're really important questions.
Now, the work: we are lucky, as Carl under, because technology allows us to work every day, every day, from every day, every day, from the Hotel Randolph.
To parents to be a corn, and I'm not going to tell anybody where the Wiii Fi works.
Not tell you about it because I want to use it.
What does this mean, this incredible liberty liberty liberty that we have to decided, we need to decide, if we have to work or not.
We can go to the calculate to play with the cell with the cell phone in the basic and the news and the news in the eye and news --
And even though they're all spent, every minutes that we see our child wind the part, we are also asking this called called this "called the a?"
"I have to have this email? I got to abboat this letter?"
And even when the answer is "no," this makes the experience of your children, it makes a lot different.
So, anything about it, you know, things like that, little things and big materials and big materials and stiles of life, life is a question of choice.
Once the world was this: Okay, there were some possibilities, but not all of a choice.
The world today is this is a positive thing to this: "Is it is a positive thing -- "Is it it is a positive or negative now?"
The answer is Shydrops.
The positive side of them all of the negative spoos.
And this choice is that choice two negative effects on the people.
The first one, paralysize, it's producing paralysis of paralysis
And many options of the chooses, it becomes very difficult to do it.
I want to give you an example of mean an an example of the plans of volunteons.
A colleagues had access to the data of Vanching society is a million sources of thinking about a million clients in 2,000 different companies in 2,000 different companies in 2,000 different companies.
What she found is that for 10 percent of the solutions that are offered in the solution of the further, the percentage of the 20 percent.
With 50 sources is 10 percent less of less ades when they have available to only have 5. Why?
Because with 50 sources that choice, is maledetail, and choically, and choices comes to the indemate to the indemate to the indemate to the indemate of the questions.
And at questions, and still asking questions, and of course, questions and of of course it doesn't have sed.
You know that it doesn't just mean that these workers will be able to food for canoes because they don't have enough money, they want to say that decision is so ostic that decision is so ostic that decision is so osticking the foundation of work.
Not tecipshing, they are losing to 5000-dollar data from the work, which would be well well to a verse.
So the paralysis is a consequence of having a choice.
And I think it makes the world like this.
"And finally, for ethnes: "echetch.
You would have to take the right decision, if it's for ethernity, right?
You don't want to choose the wrong wrong the wrong wrong.
So this is the first effect. The second is that if we can avoid the paralysis and make a choice, we were less to be less to be able to be able to be with less of the choice.
And this for different reasons.
One of these is that with a lot of conditions, if you buy it and you don't have perfectly imagine that you could have a different choice, it's easy to be better than it would be better at it. And that happens is that the alternative to the choice, and the rest of choice, and the rest of choice, and the recognizes the choice, and the recognition of the choice,
even when it was a very good decision.
More choices are easy easy to dispiact anywhere details that it's insodden insods.
Also, there's what economists is what economists call the opportunity.
Dan Gilbert asked, very well stamp as the values that we depend on what we confront with it.
In fact, when there are many options of options is easy to represent the alternative careers of the options of the option that you have choice.
Here's an example. I sent with all of the ones that are not New York.
But it's what you probably think you probably think.
There's this copy to Hamptons.
A place of slue.
It is splendey. It's all about it. It's all of it. It's all for them.
Not anything that he thinks is "Well, the disease, "Well, the disease.
"Everybody all my neighan are view."
"I could talk about home."
And it turns two weeks away from the idea that it's losing -- every day -- every day -- every day -- the possibility of parking where it wants.
The cost-opportunity diminises the fairly for what we have to have -- as the choice has been excellent.
And the options we have to consider the most of characteristics will return us as a expensive against the expensive opportunity.
Here's another example.
This view a lot of things.
We talk about the moment, and maybe of live slowly.
But the most important point is that anything you choices you choices you choices not do others.
The things that we don't choose have a lot of factive that can make less atter what we do.
Terge, spiral growing the growing expectations.
I tried on my skin bought a new jeans of jeans.
I was almost always jeans.
Once the jeans were a only type, and they were bout, they were spread to the best, they were dissimiles, only after they brought a life and worked on a lot of times, they started to go well.
So I went to buy a couple new when the old old old old old were going, and said, "I need a couple of jeans, this is my cute."
The ball, he said, "You want you to slim fit, easy phite, relaxed fit?"
Would you like to do you want to be with the botttons of the bottons?
"Like you want to row her?"
"It was eight or stretching it to the blad, you know, he was elense." He was elense at elense."
I was sbalm, and after a little bit I could take the kind of -- I want to give the kind of -- which was the only typo." It didn't have any idea that I was so for all of the disease, I was going to try to all of the disease, with the best couple of jeans that I had ever had ever ever ever happened.
It was the mye. With all that choice had the best ball.
But I felt worst I felt like that.
Why? I wrote a book to understand it.
The reason I was worst of the worst is that with all that choice of my expectations were altising were allowed to be perfectly perfected.
And I started to minimple. I didn't expected anything else about when it was only a top, but when it was only a type about 100 different in the way of being perfect.
What I had watched was good -- but not perfect.
After I was talking about the choice, I was trying to get to the confront of the waiting to expectance.
The add of options in life of people don't make people not increasing the expectations that these have respectacal options of the options of the options of the expectations that these have respectacations that these have respectacations that these have respectacations that these have respectacations in
And this will be less sodddisftion, even when the result are good --
None in the world of marketing it makes it contact.
Because if you know it was, you don't know what I'm talking about.
The truth is more like this.
"It was worsed when it was wors." The reason was wors." The reason was worst when it was worst when it was worsed when it was worsed about the surprised of the surprised surprised of pleasant to meet the surprised pleasant to meet the surprised when it was worse.
Ogy, in the world we live -- opulents, industrialized citizens with the expectancy -- the massive we can hope is that we can hope is that things are to the height.
You never have ever surprised because of your expectations, you have been expectancy expectancy for it.
The secret of happiness -- what's in here -- "Yeah, Bassese."
I want to say -- small moment auobiographic moment, and my wife is really unstuff is really stuff of my wife is really stuff at the time.
I didn't have any better do better, I don't have to be contented.
But I don't always have a bad thing.
And finally, a couple of jeans of jeans is that kind of jeans when there's only that kind of jeans is that when you don't have satisface, and you ask you "Why?"
"Who is responsible responsible is clear to it.
The world is responsible. What could we do about that?
When there are hundreds of jeans, and you ask a little bit of jeans, and you ask you who is responsible to you who is responsible for you to you, it's clear that you are in your responsible you're there.
You could do better.
Witon hundreds of variety disease, there's not a wind-successful.
So when people take decisions, they take the result is valized to be satisfied, and they get the colp to their own chole.
In the last few years the depression is explose in the industrialized world industrialized in the last few years ago.
I think a meaning a meaning -- not the unique, but important -- of this depression is that people have depression to be that people have experiences because the standards are too high.
And when they have to explain this situation thinking that colpe is them.
So the final result is that in general is that in general result, but we feel to be worse.
Let me tell you that you remember.
This is the official dog, what we all take for good and it's completely false.
There is no doubt that a little bit of choices is better than having but it doesn't have a lot of choices is better than a little bit of a who's best to be better than a who's best for a little bit of a who's choice.
There's a critic, magic value. I don't know what it is.
But I'm sure we have super-sure we have super-hit as a piece of the levels that choices our life.
Now, from political point of view, I have almost finished -- from the point of view, the following is the following is the following point of view,
What it allows you all this choice in society is the material society is the material.
There are many places in the world, and you know about it, and you know that the problem is that have no choice.
The problem is that they have too pocket.
So the face that I'm talking about is a malesclusive to modern the modern of modern modern, society.
And what makes and arrabbing and arrabby is this is: Steve Levitt told you about how those expensive expensive and charges are involved to money.
I mean that these choices, complicated and undependous, it's not just inus.
They are deleted deleted it.
They make it worse.
If you have a little bit of what in our society allows a lot of choices were reversed in those where people have too few people have too much of the way to be better --
This is what economists is a better paretian paretian pareties.
A redistribution, it's not just the poorest -- not only to poor poor, because of this choice in the excent that it comes back to us back to it.
To conclude it to conclude anything that you want to be --
You know, people of culture, "What does that weight that weight weight
"It's obvious that you can't make anything in a vetroom of vet."
"As a cool viewed vision of the world."
and I was interpret the way that I interpreted.
But then, I think about that, I realized that weight the long fish spot that weight the long time.
Because the reality of facts is that if you sent in franks, so that you can not get the freedom to the freedom freedom to the freedom to paraly.
If you rop the mouse that all become possible to become possible diminized the mouse of the fair.
You hear the parals, and you reduce the well.
Everybody needs a sphere.
This is almost certainly too strectch, perhaps even for us.
But the absorts of some symbolic symbolic symbolic infelicity for the winds.
Thank you very much.
