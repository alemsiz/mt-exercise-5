The year I showed these positive demonstrate that the test type that the test glacial calves, which is almost three million years of the 48 States of 40, is restretted.
And this is the gravity of the problem because it doesn't show the become of the ice of the ice ice ice of the ice ice ice of the ice ice ice ice of the glacish.
The art typical climbed is, in a sense, the cuor clean ads of the global system of the global system climate system.
It expands of inver, and I returned out of expand.

Four times more numbers in the last 30 years of the last 30 years I respect to 75.
This is a rest of the instant.
If you look at the context of the story if you can see the consequence.
In the last five years we added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the ocean in the ocean in the oceans every day.
Look at the time the Pacific area of oriental Africa, drobs and in the west, and on the sub-radical parts of the African unpoor in the oceans.
Most of global rescaling global deforestation, which is 20, and it's 20, is the usual combustic combinable combustible were us.
The oil is a problem, and the carbon is lost even worse is even even worse
The United States are one of two countries, together with the more emissions, together to China.
And they propose to build many other person carbon and carbon and carbon
But we're assisting a change.
These are the projects of annonothing in the last years and some of the versus of versus of versus of versus of versus of ver.
At every way, there's a political lotles, in our Paese.
The industries of the carbon and oil have 250 million dollars in the last year to promote the carbon the carbon the carbon and is a hossideed.
This picture I remember me something --
Natan, in Natal, in the Tennesse, where I live a 3.8 billion literal charges of charges of charges.
Maybe you saw it on the news.
This is the second largest flows in America.
It's happened around Natal.
The nacior public natalia of carbon industry was this one.
Video: Man: Mr. Frosty is a kind of a kind of happiness.
It's abundant here in America, and maintained our economy.
Frosty the carbon is more and more clean more clean more clean more clean hand.
It's about good precise precise and workers are keep it in the middle of the stand.

The largest society is Massey Coal. This is Massey Coal. This is his friend of the amministrator.
Video: Don Bland -- I will be ask -- Al Gore, Nancy Pelog, Harry Reid -- not what they're talking about.
At Gor: So the Alleance for Proteon the Clim of Clim has a two campaign.
This is a essentially, a hot of it.
Video: Actor: At a COALLet's see the climate changes like a minact of our business.
So our priority is to invest a great amount of money in a public advertissforce to make the versus of the carbon the carbon the carbon the carbon the carbon the carbon the carbon the carbon of the carbon a public s
In fact, the carbon is not sport.
We think it's a good good -- it has a good properon fum.
So not pretty pretty climate change of climate change.
Let me do now.
Video: Actor: Carbon -- you know, I heard about a lot of it.
So we do this in a structure at a facture about how it is about how it is about the carbon the carbon the carbon the carbon the carbon the clean to the carbon the carbon the clean to the fract.
Straordinary machines are a little rorit, but this is the sound of clean technology of carbon of clean en.
The consumer of carbon is between the major rescaling global rescaling technology of the carbon that you can see change.
Do a eye -- this is the odier-technology of carbon technology of clean it.
At Gor: Indead, the positive positive is connected to the economic issue and the national security and the national security of national security of national sures.
Man: Like America, is in the economy, the economy, the national security of national security climate climate climate climate climate climate ate crisis.

Now, perhaps there is a new audition to us.
Repower America, 100-hard energy, in dieces in the old old old old old hold.
They like to reput the global America to work with the work, really, and help the global riscaling global rescales.
Finally, a solution, a solution that basts to solve our problems.
Repower America. Scoprint more.
At Gor: This is the ultim.
Video: I mean: Here's a die to America.
One of the fastest modence to dependence from the combustic dependence from our planet.
All the future is here. Vent, a new energy network, a new energy.
She talks about 2: Nuoves to work for places of work and retribits.
Man: Repower America. It's time to be realists.
At Gor: A proverbio African proverbio African says, "If you want to go to the money.
If you want to go to the long, you can go to this."
We have to go to the top of it.
Thank you very much.
The year at TED phececks a year on the LHC.
And I promise to reach to the machine.
So I was just like this. And for those who are not there -- the other time -- LHC is the largest scientific experiment -- 27 miles of conference.
His compit is to receive the conditions that were less than a second of the universe -- until until -- until to 600 million times a second.
And it all is that I really environment.
This is the Gineva.
We can do these mini-Big Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bi-Big Big Bang Big Big Bang Big Bang Big B.
This is what I work. It's called ATLAS -- is largely 444 meters and has a diameter of 22 feet --
This is a picture of the spectacular image of ATLAS in building proportions.
10 settember 10 sets have accesor we accesor the first time.
And this picture was taken by ATLAS.
It was because of immenses in the control.
It's a picture of the first phascious particles that had all the game of LHC, ranging in collision, deliberated, with a part of the LHC, and diffundules in the LHC, and diffundult particles in the relevel.
In other words, when we see that picture the 10 settember, we can understand the machine, which is a great life.
I don't know if it was to do us more opening this when somebody went to Google and lives that the pay was this one.
That means we have a cultural impact of cultural impact on the scientific impact.
About a week later, we had a problem with the machine, I had to these files here -- these movies here -- these movies here --
These movies are 13,000 print when the machine works at the powerful maxized powers.
Now, technical technical and deal with the files and dirane, "It's not trute. I'm a most."
And they can do it because when I'm very fredness to be the cosid-called the surfaces of the surfaces.
So, at less 271 degrade to a inferior to that space between the stars, these files can bring that corrects, these files can bring that corred.
In one of the most of the most of the most of emila in the LHC, there was a fabrization.
So the files are surriwered to read and 13,000 printing 13,000 printing that they met a resistance.
This was the result.
Now, this is still more impressionating if you think that these magnets fishing fish -- and that are several than 30 centimeters.
They're damage about 50 magnets.
We had to take it to you and what we did it.
We have repristined and adjusted.
Now they're returns out all the ground.
Entrum the end of LHC will be new integrated again.
We will access to get it to get the universe. We can get the data or him, and continuing so our wind to discover what our wind to discover what the universe.
Now, of course, in a certain the way, these drops the dibact of science and engineering science and engineering.
I think that the fact that this is so difficult to go over the limits, I think this is the value of things like LHC.
I want to let with the words of a scientists of scientists in the English, which imagine, in defesus -- in defesor of his hold, his hollue, his hot was Michael Faraday, said, "No much dangerous for the progress of human minds as the human beings of human minds of science as well, which is not about our own own own own money to the game of the world, which is not the realities of the world."
Thank you.
I want to start asking you to rethink about here, to play here, to play with children, played the battons.
While you can figure them as well and reliar, take them and move them and move them and move them to think and resolve problems and relationships.
The reason is is deployed to the way we understand the way we understand the world around around us.
So, by information informed by the useful thing of our interaction with physics, together to my consult of my consult Jeevan Kalanith, I started to ask my consult of the consult of being a computer, and if we use a computer, instead of the mouse as well as well as well as well as a crazy that move on a lot of information with a lot of handlevel,
and system, to our pleasure the pleasure of our food pleasure?
The question was so interesting that I decidemust to explore the answer, building Siftable.
In point words, a Sift's a whole interactive computer interactive as a bird.
In point words, a Sift's a whole interactive computer interactive as a bird.
You can move with the hand, they can see sit between them, and they feel the way, and they have a wireless.
But basically enough, I have physics, as the matton -- they can move to simply recording to it.
The Siftless is an example of a new ecosystem of information.
And as they become more physics, consciousness, and people who become more physical and as they become more physics, consciouss, and others, like the perhaps, like to explore new stying, we can exploring new stiles and function.
I'm going to start with some example.
This is configured to show vide: if I inct the video -- if I including video a direction, if I including it from the other part of the other side back.
These are interactive ritriticians are consciouss.
If I am -- if you are interested in what they are around it.
If they are connected to it, and they can agree a little bit of it.
If they are connected to it, and they can agree a little bit of it.
They also trum their movement, and inclination.
We realized that one of the interesting thing that one of the interaction was the powered communities of the data, "versation are" as as if a liquid.
In this case, we have three Siftless as a sect of vernice and I can use them to the color, where they mix in the central central where they mix mixed it.
and I can use them to be using them in the central central where they missed them in the middle of the color.
If we can reput it a little bit of a little bit of it.
These are also possible to appreciate things that are involved with languages of logical and games of logical logical and see the results of logical results.
Now I'm --
This is a Fibonact that I do with a program of here.
Here we have a game words that is in the Scarabeo and Boggle.
Pratically, to every turn in the house in Siftable, Pratically, to every turn in the Siftable, and as a literally I was a literally in the Siftable, and as some of the controls on a dition.
Then, after about 30 seconds of remissing a new set of lects, and new possibility to try to prove and new possibility to try to try to prove it.
Thank you.
This is what the children in the Middle Lab, I did it and I made them a video.
They are pleasures like that.
And one of the interesting things about this gence is that we don't have to give people a lot of people in many people in the people of the instruments.
You just say, "Like the words, and they will be exactly what to do.
Here's what other people who tried it.
This is our young head, there is a young to the rop.
It actually wanted to be implorant implore.
They just were only a bias, him.
Now, this is an interactive application of a interactive cards.
We wanted to build a tool to appreciate language Luke is Felix.
It can inserve new personages in the scene, I had to be able to their associated.
It can inserve new personages in the scene, I had to be able to their associated.
And so, it's doing using the sun.
Video: The suns is source.
David Merrill: On a hour.
Video: The treator --
Bel work!
So school Siftless and and you put the neighbors to the person can interact peoples --
Video: Bau!
-- I invent the story.
Video: Caa!
DM: It's a story with an open, and it can decide how you know.
DM: It's a story with an open, and it can decide how you know.
Video: Volole, I gattle.
DM: The last example I have time to show you is a tool, realized to recently, to save and expensive music.
it's a instrument, recently recently to field music.
The Siftable here is basically basically based on the basic and the bacteria.
Every one of these has four different variations, and you can chook what you use it.
You can inserve these sounds in a sequence from a sequence to your food sequence.
And modifiargued it just to touch a "sounds and a "sequence."
These are effects that you can control from living, as the reverse and the most.
The attack of a particular sound to add it.
And then there are general effects like time and volum, which is apples that are apply to interest sequence.
Look at how it works.
Video: DM: We'll start a base in two Siftled Siftl, we can system, the system, we can instead of the encise we add other base.
Now I put a bass-line.
Video: DM: Oh I think about the percentuses --
Video: DM: And now I'm going to put the movie to the bacteria, so I can control from live from the live.
Video: DM: I know to fast the whole sequence of a time from a time from a level or from the other square on the other square on the other square on the other square on the other square of the time to the whole sequence.
Video: I will add the move filter to the base to the base to the lower expression.
Video: DM: I can recombining the sequence,
So I don't have to planning the primat, but I can provise, make it more than holder or more corts.
And now, finally, I can even get the whole sequence sequence in the left of the left Siftline "volume."
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is building new man-machine is more more than our brain works, how our brain and body.
And today, I had time to show you one of the result of this perfor, and some possible possibility that we try to bring out of the lab.
The concept that I want to transmit is that we get this new generation of objects to interact with the media digital media are information in our world that we want to do in our world in the way we want to do it.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the time to talk to you about all of you.
I'm a write write of it.
Scare about books is my professional extension but it's more than this --
It's also the love and the fashim.
And I don't expect that can change it.
But I said, something that was success to be a success of my careera, which has taken me to realibring the whole report with this work.
The particular thing I recently is that I recently this book, this biography called Mangia, Prega, Ama." And the differently from my previous -- for some reason -- and became a great devices, and became a great consttion, western interactional sensition of interational interational interational interational interational interational relational.
And the result is that everywhere from now, people like I was conditive, people like they were conditive.
Davue -- condence, condence.
They are now now that I worry about and says, "Don't do you can not be able to do me?
You don't have to keep on to continue to write for the whole life without being able to create a book that can be able to create a book that can importing somebody to a book that can you have to be able to get somebody to a book that can be able to do you can be able to do a book,
which is to importing somebody who who can you say any?"
It's running -- you know, you know.
But it may go worse -- I remember that I remember, when I started to say to people -- I was a adolescent -- I wanted to be a writing.
I met against the same reaction of the same based by the country.
And people said, "Don't you have to success?
Don't you putting the um of the refires?
You don't have to do this mests to do this mests all of life without snothing that was ever seen and to die on a heart of lock of the shock of lock energy gype of lock of locy?"
So, you know.
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is, "Se."
I am country's country.
I always had to have a paper --
And I also paper of many other things that people could not have to mean to mean to mean to it.
As a and other things of, and other things of.
But as I realized about the write I thought and I wonder to be a good because it is?
Is that range?
It's logical that I have to expect to be often by a work that you feel to do it.
But what is that particular in the pretty recreative to make us to relial health half of the mindsing isn't it?
As my father, for example, he was a engineer and I don't remember one time in his 40 years of the activity that was asked if they were asked to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer capit?
Don't have the engineer John, how do you wis?
It didn't work, right?
Enestly, the engineers are not as a group of set in the set of the reputation of being alcolized to be alcolized by maniuuudgments of being drive.
We have enough to go back to the reputation, and not just writers but creative of every general, we have this reputation of being huge being enormous instable.
And not rest is that looking at the tristand of the deaths of the magnition of the magnition of the magnition of the wind century, they often to themselves.
And the ones that are not suicide to be really, they like to be really, by their woms.
Norman Mailer, before I did, in the last person said, "Ogny book me a little bit of a little bit of a poor more," a poor more," a remarkable poor of the work of the work of the word of their life.
But we don't have to say when we heard about why we heard these things that are very long as we have a completely interiorized and accepted the notion that the creative creativity and the rest of the relief of the end, conducted to the ancient and scientist.
And the question I want to ask all of the today is, you're going to do with this ide?
It goes on this -- because I also looked at a centimeter of distance to me not be about anything for anything that supposed to anything that supposed to be a good thing.
I think it's goody.
And I think it's dangerous and I don't want to see the perpetuate in the next century.
I think it's better encourage our great minds creative to live.
And I know that in my home -- in my home -- in my home -- it would be very dangerous to began to be deposed to the circumstances in which are in my carera.
Obbly -- insometimes are young young --
I still have about four decade of work in me.
And it's very likely that anything about what I will be right by the world as the work that is going to be used by the world as a work that was going to be used by the world as a book.
I'm going to be slave, because we are all more or friends here -- it's likely to my very success is to my shouldn't be the shares.
Oh, Gese, which is --
You know, this is the kind of though though I would start a person to start to begin to the nine matter and I don't want to do it.
I would continue to do this work that I love to do this work that we love it.
So, the question becomes be?
And so I seed to do a lot of reflections, which is to continue to keep that to create a psychological cool, right?
I have to find a distance of safety found between me, I am writing to me and my natural reaction that I was a reaction of what I was trying to get E, and I was trying to find E, and I was trying to look through the time, trying to find some other society for the time, trying to find other society to see if I could have to see if I could have the most of the best ideas and sane of the best ideas and sanks and set of the most and the sancial connections of the most of the brokety ideas that I would have to the s
how to help people creative to reset people emotional inerent people emotion.
And that research me at the ants and Roma.
Seguitems because it was in certain and then back.
In the ants of Grecia and anthic ancient people don't believe that the creative creative synes?
It was thought that the creative creative is about divine and that came up and that came from a few distant distant distant distant and set of distant distant distant and constants and constants and constitute.
The creative is called these dives look at the people of the creative creative creative creative of creative creative to the demonis."
Socrate, wonderful of course, created to have a demon that else seven from long.
Romans were the same idea, but they called the kind of spirit without body a genie.
And that is great as a hus, because Romans were not really a particularly intelligent genius.
They believe that a genius was this kind of divines that created in the result of a study of a study artist, a little like the elf, like elf, and that came out of the work of the work of the artist, and that came up of the result of the result of that work.
Exxish -- et, that is the distance of which is that the psychological costruck that psychological results of your work.
And everybody knew that was that was so that it working, right?
So the artists were protected by certain things, like for example, right?
If your work was exceptional work was that you can't take and everything the market, everything work, everything that was helped by this genius.
If your work work, if your work work, it was not colp, right?
Everybody knew that was your genius.
And so the people han concept that creative creative in Ocdent for a long time.
And then Rinasciment came and all changed that, and all changed this great idea; we put to the human human idea; we put the human human creatures and without let to the creatures of the creatures that writing from the divinity.
This was the main of human eximution and people began to think that creative creative creative synm by the ishing.
And for the first time in history, you get to this or that artist of this artist as a genie of genius, which is a person with genie.
And I have to tell you that I think it was a big error.
I think that allowed to someone, a simple person to believe that being a recips like a recips and the source of all my misteries of all my misteries and the erness of the glassibility of a responsibility or a lost of human beings.
It's like to ask somebody of engineer the sun.
But but and histor, completely the ego and creates all these engineer expectations on the performance.
And I think this was a pression to aver the artists in the past 500 years.
And, if this is true, and I think that I asked the question, and hor?
Can we can do it different?
Magary to a more ants of the ants of the human relationships between human relationships.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we can't cancells of a rational though years of rational talks about 18 minutes.
And probably there is people in the audiences that would be reading to the non-in-susped scientific notion of the nice that they follow their projects.
I'm not convinced you don't know about this thing.
But the question I want to ask is -- why do you know?
Why don't think about this modo?
Because it has more sense of every other thing that I ever heard to explaining the exasperant exxed process of creative process of creative process.
A process is, as anybody who ever you have to do something -- so fundamentally, all of the right -- and so fundamentally not behavior.
And, in fact, it can seems completely paranormal seems completely paranormal seem to be completely paranorm.
I met this meeting with the extraordinary poeters, which has 90 years, but that was a poet, but that was a poet, but that was a poeters, and he said, that the infancial infection in the field, and I heard of the reality of the reality of the countravel, and I was the rest of the countryside of the countrysquared the rest of the country.
I said that was like a great phragorous phragorous fragorous of air.
And that was coming up to the line of the country.
And it goes to get the ground below the earth under his feet.
It was just to have a only thing to do to that point and it was dies, "corrup, "corrup."
And so it goes to home and it was insequite a poeter and it would have to make another poet, and a nice piece of paper and a mathematics and a drop of it, and a drope and rest the payer on the page.
And in the three times that we can't be quickly, so corres and corres and corres and corres without able to get into home and poetered through the roll and the lost of the lost and it would continued to roll through the land and would continued through the countravel."
Then there were the times -- this piece of -- this piece of time -- there were no time that was almost lost almost lost almost lost almost losing --
So, he was runing at home and he was trying to carry and poet, and the poet, and he was a walking in the way, and then he said, and then he said, that was a walked with the other hand and the office and the off.
And he was poeting the poetry from the coast of the covered and the couple of the page.
And in these things, the poetry would be presented on the perfect page, but at the last pard of the first pard to the first slight-up page.
So when I heard about -- is the prices, it's exactly equal process.
I don't have my creative process -- I'm not a condition -- I'm not a conditive.
I'm a mule, and my working is to work is, I can see it is, I can see it in the same orary every day, and to go and go and go and go to the office and to go on and go on and to go on and go on and go on and go to the right hold.
But even though my head, in my head -- I striped against that thing,
And I image that many of you have a han done of you do it.
You know, if the work and ideas I came up to a certain set of a certain founded I could not know.
And what this is this thing?
And how we can relate to the same way to do not to do the head and mapiles, which is that we do it?
And as I reduce the best example I think I am a musician I was the musician I interview I interview that I interview a day.
We were talking about this, and you know, Tom, and you know, Tom, the major life was a recognnation of the artist of the foreign around, to control these species of creative impulses to creatives that inspired these species of creative clean interiors.
But then I mean that, and a day, and a day, and a day, when he was drive on the authroa-up up up to Los Angeles, changed all for him.
It was going to go fast, and everything about this little fragment of a lodia, which is a little broke in his head as a inspiration, and the synthes, and the wish and you want to be a wonderful and the wish wish and wish wish and wish that is a winditive, but not how to take it.
It has not a piece of paper -- it has no matter, it has a mathemator has no recorator.
So I began to feel this species of old and he said, "I'm going to lose the right to lose and hossessioned by this canzone of this canzone of this canzon for this canzon this canzone of this canzon
I'm not enough enough and I can't do it."
And instead of the panic stop --
I'm going to be the whole process and he did something completely new process.
And he looked like the sky and said, "Scus, I don't see that I'm dy?"
"To seems that can write a song dog dog?
If you really want to exist, you get to a more opportunity when I can take to you.
One of mind, I love to the other today.
You can go to disturbing Leonard Cohen."
And his process I was working on this one.
Not the work, the work, the work, the work,
But the process, and fishing is that we attempt was released when the genius, the genius, which was that he was going to be a remained by which is a remained by which is a whole thing that was a whole thing that was a whole thing that was a whole thing about the whole thing that was a whole thing and I returned back and rettment.
but well, this piece of work, wonderful bizards a conversation between Tom and this thing thing that strange and exert that it was not Tom.
So as I heard that story about the story that I was working and I already and I already a flying time.
This idea, I save me when I was writing "Mangia, Prega, Ama," and he was in a of those care of those class of the disperation of the disperation of that we were working on something and we couldn't start thinking that a disaster that will be a disaster that is going to be the worse to think that is going to be a disaster books.
Not just good at the worst book.
And I began to think about this project.
But then I remembers to the air and try to talk to the air and tries.
So I love my face in the hands of my face and I would say my bements to a stance.
And I said, "Yeah, what I mean, "Yeah, what we know that if this book not not going to be brilliant not going to be brilliant not going to be brilliant colate -- right?
Because as I see I am just put all all of what I -- I don't have more than that.
So if you want to give you a better and do your parts.
OK, but if I don't know what I don't know about it, I don't know what I don't know.
I'm going to write the same because my work.
And I want to do that that was recorded that I today I today I was presented to to my theat," because the end is -- -- the end is -- in the deserts of the North of Africa, people were raundances to the light of the move and the musics and the sacky and until the lots of the be.
And they were always magnific and they were were professional and they were fantastic.
But every tap, of course, something happened happen, and one of these artists became to reality in fact,
And I know what I know about that, because I know what you saw everybody, a certain point, a performance like this.
It was as if the time you stop and the walking through a species of a portal lands and not really easy from the solity, as a 1,000 nights, but all of the primast, but all of the ineava.
And in suddenly not just like a human human human --
But you get access to the deal and under illuminated in the middle of divinity.
And when this happened to them, the people know what they were called him what it was called her named her names.
They had the hand.Ah.D, "Oh, Allah, Oh, Dod God, God."
That's God, you know.
And he was boring n, historical namics in the south of Spay this abitude with their and pronunciate changed in the secolums of the "Oh, Allah, Allah, Allah, Ah," which you can feel in the sleep.
In Spay -- when a done is done something impossible and magic -- "Oh, oh, magnize, bavo," be," bravo," and a short of God's God.
And it's great because we have to do.
But the problem is the day down, the baller baller stand and and discovers that are 11 of the middle of Martedge -- and the scoring of Dod is not more.
It's just a mortal death, and maybe we can't even even more to the hot that we never can ever ever be able to the him.
And maybe no one will be the name of Dod even as I ago, and so what to do with the rest of his life?
It's difficult to be hard to be hard to be hard to be hard to be hard to be hard to be hard to be hard to him.
This is one of the most dolorous recycle recycle recycle recycle recycle recycle rich.
But maybe not to be so ancient to be so ancient if you can not believe that the most expects of your being coming from you are coming from you to you,
But I believe that they are data to be data by a picture of a imaginable imagable imagable of your life that you have to past somebody else when you have to past somebody else when you get to somebody else when you get to somebody else when you have to go on a founded up to somebody else when you go to somebody else when you get to go on a lot of your life.
And, you know, if we think about this whole whole change.
And so I started thinking about it, and it's surely like I thought about different months in the work, and I thought that public book, the book, the dangerous dangerous -- dangerous dangerous of my great deal of my great deal of my great success.
And what I have to continue to say when I feel electric I think, I didn't have to paint --
I don't have to be around. It just your work.
Continues to presentt your party, which is that you can be it.
If your work is ball, ball, ball.
If the divine, I assurd, you know, I mean to let some kind of wonderful time to the kind of wonder, just a moment through your forces, now "Ole!"
One of your dance.
And "Ole!" to you, you know.
I think and I think I think I deban to teach it.
"Ole!" to you, just to you, just for hot to love human talks to to make you continue to make you continue to representing continue to to keep continue to represent.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
As you know, I already talked about some of these projects on the human genome of new set of genes.
We're beginning a new locorn: we started digitalizing biology and now to be able and now to that code biology, we're entering in a new fashion, designing and synthesizing life.
We always tried to take big questions.
"What is the life, "What is a lot of biological belief of levels.
We tried to have different approaches, reducing the minimes.
We're digitalizing almost 20 years ormaes.
When we sequenced the genome of human world is treating from the analogical world of biology in the digital world.
Now we can clear: We can regenerate the life, or creating new life from this universe to digital?
This is the map of a small organism, Mycoplasma genome of genome genome between those that can autoreplasure genome in lab.
And we tried to reduce the genome of genome to create a smaller.
We are able to eliminate a hundred genes of about 500 that are here.
But when we look at his map in his map metabolic map of us.
I deed, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can elimine, a very imlikely that this can bring to a live.
So we decided that we decided to progrew this is intetic to progress to be able to modifishing the components to some of these questions.
And so we began the wind of "Posze we can inteticate a mother?"
It can make the chemistry of protect these big molecules that we never have to create before this?
And, in case of fact, we can make a cromoso-mak?
A cromosome is just a piece of inert-inert-inert.
The speed with which we are able to digitalize life is growing life is growing exponential exponential exponential that we are able to detect the exponential with the exponential that we can digitalize the exponential life is growing to detect the exponential of the exponential disappear.
Our ability to write the genetic code of genetic talking, progressslype --
And our most recents results the result of a exponential curve.
We have began more than 15 years ago.
The process has requires requires with a biothic revision before the first experiments.
But we found that synthesize DNA is very difficult.
There's a decade of thousands of the world that are producing little segments of DNA, the moon of 30 to 50 leck and is a degenerative process -- the most of 30 to 50 lect is longer than the segment set of 30 to 50 lected us to 50 land and is a device.
So we had to develop a new metom to assembling these fragments and correct the errors.
And this was our first tative, in particularly dealing by the information of the genome of Phi By 174.
It's a small virus that kills bacteria.
We designed the phramments, effectuated the correction of the errors and keep a DNA of about 5,000 letters.
The interesting part is when we took this piece of inherent material of iners, the bacteria have began to read this genetic code this genetic code of the viral particles to read this virtual viral particles of viral particles in the viral.
The viral particles are then you have been relet to the cells, they are back, and they distrops.
I talked about recent with members of oil industry was saying that they have certainly pretty behind this model.
They have more than you.
We think that this is a situation where the software can really built his own hardware in a biological system in a biological system in a biological system in which is a biological system that is really building his own hardware that the software can really build the same him.
But we wanted to do things more in big things in big things.
We wanted to build the whole whole cromosome.
I'm more than 580 miles of code code code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code code of genetic code code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code code code.
So we thought of built it in the cassets of virus, so that we could change the cassets to change the cassets to understand what the lives.
The design is crucial information is crucial information in a computer, these have to be very accurate to be very accurate to be very accurate.
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 the accurateth, was a mile of a error.
We found out of that, 30 herrors. If we were used that sequenced that sequenced sequence. We never have been able to do this work.
A part of the process is to design set to 50 lack that they were dropping with all other segments of 50 lects of 50 lecks to build underneath to build underneath with together.
We can reach elements here.
You probably have that we read the phylie.
Think of this -- we have a genetic code on four letter: A, C, G, and T.
Three of those lects together with about 20 amminous ammino-am-minual lectural lectures for every minamoual load.
So we can use the genetic code to write words, frather thought.
What we did at the beginning is automobirth.
Some are deluses from the fact that was not poet.
We designed these segments to simply them to simply with the entirely simply to be able to connect them with the same way.
There's imes that repet them and they put them and put them them together.
And we started to assembling of the particular set of five to five to seven my letter, and a very under to form 24 miles a lecture of the only one to get to get 72 miles on to get 72 miles the literally until to get 72 miles the literally to get 72 miles a lk of the particular way to get to 7
We have produced these segments in the abundances so power that we are so powered to create a procept that we're telling a remarkable production -- as you can see in a minute.
We're trying to automatizing the process.
So, this seems the tabellon a tables of a basket.
When we are to these very long long as a long time than 100 miles -- more than 100 miles -- they will not grow in E.
It's really, to the limb tools of the modern biology of molecular biology.
So we consider other mechanisms.
We know about another mechanism called recombination called recombination of biology, which in biology to repeak DNA in the universe of the universe segments.
Here's a example.
This organism, called Deinococs raft in the ans, can assummer three million radiation.
You can see in the requader as his cromosomes as his cromosome.
In 12 -- 24 hours is reassembled as it was primad.
They were thousands of organisms that are able to do this.
These organisms can be totally to be totally to be totally to be totally to be totally to be totally totally to be completely him.
They can live under you want to live under it.
I'm absolutely such that life exists in space, and you spoke to find new environments of water.
Actually, the NASA showed that this aven.
This is a picture of molecule that we built these process, just using these process, just using the design appropriate design appropriate design appropriate segments from inserious segments of initive.
The lievit them assembly the automatically.
This picture is not been taken with a microscope electronic microscope of the microscope of rules.
It's a very big molecules that we can see the with a microscopy burch of it.
These are picture that they cover a period of about six seconds.
This is the audiences we did a long time ago.
I'm more than 58,000 of code code code code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code code of genetic.
It's the largest molecules of a definitely created by man.
It has a fish, a fish, 300 million hundred million people.
If we stamp with a 10 without 10 without 10 without the 10 without of the price of translate this genetic code this genetic code this genetic code of it.
Now, how do we work, how can we do that?
Obviously, we can be a virus is a girls.
It's a little more complicated when you use the bacteria.
It's just a simpler cells as a cell cells like our re: you simply the nuclear and insert the nuclear and insert a high, which is practically the process of clon.
In the bacteria argue is instead is instead of the cell phones in the cell, but we recently demonstrated that we are able to do a cromosome of a cromosome of a cromosometimes from a other and active to another and active it to another cell phone and the other active cell phone and a cell of the cell phones of a c
We can have a cromosomes by a months from a months like a microbial species
The two are are different as men as men as men are topis.
We have add some genes in a way to decide what to chromom to decide to this cromom for this cromom --
And then scientists with the inspired ines to kill all the protected protected protected the protected protected protected with the protections.
And when we put in the cellum is a stupended -- and you appreciate our graphic sofft, the new cromosomes is gone in the cell phone.
And we begin that we can't go to it, but we tried to be a lot of a lot of hard to be more in there.
This is one of the major mechanisms of evolution.
We found that antime that many species have added a second or a third or a third hundreds of new tracks in a second thousands of new tracks.
So who think about evolution as a gene of the time that modific modific is not understand the biological part of the biological biology.
They were dealing called "imurections of restrion is that addictions are the DNA.
The cell that was in the cell as it was not a one that is not a one.
The cellula-the cromosomes that we inserito-ce cromosomes --
It's expressisiside, and it has recognized the other hand, as a matter and we recognized with only the cell phone and the new cromodel.
became blue blue because of genes we have insert.
And in a short of time, all the carries of a species of a species are lost of a species, and it turns out of the new software that we have ined in the cell phone that we have involved in the cell.
All the protects are changed, the members are changed, and when we gave the genetic code of the equivessels that we transfer to what we have transfer to what we transfer in it.
Now, this may seemy look at the genetic software the software DNA we can change things in the enough to change things in enought.
Now, I explained that here is not parts of genesess, but by three million years of evolution from three million years of evolution, and I said, maybe we're going to create a new version of the explosion of Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosion of this process on this process of the process of this digital process of the genesal process of evolutionary process on this process of the geness, and I said,
Why do I this?
I think it's enough enough to our necessities that we think about our necessity.
We're going to past six billion people to nine billion people in the next 40 years.
And I was to give a example: I was born in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet to each other people on the 1946; in 40 years, there will be a quickly.
We're going to find the problems right now to find food, water and clean and basic and basic bind and a half of people.
It will still be hard to do it for us.
We can get more than five billion carbon of olide billion of bars.
That means a hundred million bars to day.
When we try to find biological process, or any kind of process to replace to repiece of process to be a huge challenge of the enormous process,
In the most of the CO2 emission of CO2 from these materials that finishes in the atmosphere.
At day, thanks to the scientific discovered in the world, we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I like to think that are components to think that are the future.
The electronic industry is just a dozen dozen about how many different things are coming.
Our limited here are data by biological reality and our imagination.
Now we have techniques, thanks to these methods of synthesization, able to create what we call genomic genomic genomic genomic genomic genomic synthesization,
We are able to build a big robot that can produce a million-cromosomes to a day.
Think of processing these 20 million genes of different genes of genes or to protect the processes to protect the process, we can change it, and create biology and creating biology and creating biology of science.
And it's just a sleep, I just a sleep.
We can chook to survive, to survive, providing chemistry, prodution or of vaccines or or carbon of vaccines --
This is an istant istants of some software programmed on where we're working for being able to be able to be able to design species in computer.
Well, we don't know we need to be like this.
We know exactly became out of their genetic code of genetic code --
Now we're concentrate on the carbon of how much about the generation.
You also seen you seen you saw you out of the grant was a month.
We have a lot of second and generation that will be using enough pretty much enough to paper per zero-to-skets like the ottypes of butanol.
But the only way that biology can have a great impact of food without major major food and limited the coest of food and limiting CO2 in material to prima, which we're working for the primal cells that can reach this discovered cells that can reach this -- and we think of the first generation in the midddle generation in about 18 months.
The sunlightly light with CO2 is a metodom -- but in our discovered in the world, we fun different metodies.
This is a organism that we described in 1996.
See in the ocean deep in the ocean for the temperature of the water perature of the water.
They reduce the CO2 using the hydrogen molecular energy.
We're trying to figure if we can inchance, which can be transported to be transported to be transported by the CO2 in the CO2 in the carbon this process.
So that short we could be able to increase what the basic question that questions that question is Noy, very much -- we have the life." And we have the repian industry of oil industry the oil industry.
Exattactly of us to TED, where you can you do it from TED, where you can do that?
It would be a major powered energy.
Inoland, we're working for the same metoes to create vaccines to create vaccines of these instants.
You saw this year with influence, we are always back, and a year and a dollar, in less when it is to find vaccine the right vaccine --
I think that that this is that that can change combinable in anticipate that in anticips.
That's how the future could began to seeming change, the tree of evolution, acceling the evolution, and indeed, argues -- and indeed, cell cells -- and indetected cells.
We are so to so that to be better to people.
Our discover is to live enough to try to make it a long way to try to do it. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
But but but I will see the most rapidly possible, some of the new technology that we have bring to Microsoft in the Microsoft in the followed water in a year ago, this is Seadragon. This is Seadragon.
This is a environment where you can interact is in the local level with a huge amount of data with a huge amount of data visis.
And we're seeing a lot of gabyte of photos with a kind of a kind of a kind of constants and continuous glass and continuous gamic slips like we want to images like that.
And it doesn't matter how big amount of information that we see, how big these colds of these data or images.
Most are communities commons are communities, but this for example, but this for example, and I reented by the Bilibrary of Congress in the gam, and reented in 300 megam.
It's not not a difference because the only thing that limitation of a system like this is the number of system on your screen. It's a very flexible. It's a very flexible.
This is a book inter, example, I don't images.
This is the Casa desolated of Dickens. Ogni colon-represents a capitol.
And to show you that this is just about head, and we can do a thing about this, to make a real representation of a rection of a representation of a representation of a picture.
It may be a way to read a little bit of a book electronic book.
Not not considered it.
This is a more realistic example of a number of Guardian.
Every picture is the beginning of a section.
And it will be the pleasure and the beauty of a read version of a review of a view or a view of a quote of a quote of a very simply of meeting.
We also did something with the angle of this number of this number of Guardian.
We created a public advertising to other, more than -- much more than that we use in a normal public advances -- and we insered you in the content of content extra.
If you want to see the caristic carries, you can see here.
Or other models, or even the specific specific models,
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminating the limites of space.
We hope that this means that I can get pop pop and other porcheries like this, not to be necessarily as we don't have to be necessary.
In course, the map is one of the most obvious applications of technology.
And on this is not lose I want to lose the time, if we don't mean that we have contributes in this camp.
These are all the way in the USA sobswips on a image of NASA.
So now we go to something else.
This is effectively from the webs; you can go to see it.
This is a project called Photosynth, which is two different technology.
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual researching in the computer computer in Noah Snavely, a student of the University of Washington, with the Helish of the U.S. and Rick Selish Selish Resear.
And it's from the web, gestures from Seadragon.
You can see it when we do this kind of screen, where we can past up from another image of a picture of experience to be a multiple.
But the collocaon the picture here has actually a meaning.
The realgorithms of computers have recorded these pictures together, so that they recorrespond to the reals that images -- all the near the lights of the Grashs on the Grashs of the Roccip: they were all the Roccient of a slight-showed slight-le-show of a sli-shows that things are all the college of the things are all the college of the collegal levels.
I don't know if I have time to show you some other environment.
And I am some more spaces.
I want to past directly to one of the Noahusbess, and this is protype of Photosynynynthesynth--- to show you what we have to work, to show you what I think about the first time is really the ask of this technology, very equal technology, very evidence this technology, that we have a set of the environments that we have the environmental environments that we have a web.
We had to worry about the legal and saying it.
This is a reconstruction of Notage Dame pictures from Flickr. Basta Can Dame in Flickly. Basta Coh in the fair, and you get images of types and you say, other than the field: one of these connects of these connects of these connect conaround, and one of these constructs that is discovered to this model.
So I'm all the picture of Flickr and are all connected to the spacal level in this way.
And it's possible to navigate in this simple.
You know, I have never thought I would never think of the working for Microsoft.
It's very gratefy this kind of accourage here.
I think that you can see that this is a lot of different types of photoamer: from those cells in the SLR, a numbers of SLR, a meaning together in this environment.
And if you can try to try to try to those strange.
Many are block from fact, except --
And in some part here is a series of photographs -- except --
This is a Notage of Notage Daame Dame Dr.
We can past from the placer to the physics of this environment.
The essential point is that we can do things with the social environmental environmental -- from the interviewed the Earth, from the point of visual -- and college of the visual -- and college all those those data together.
All those pictures become together, most of the particular of the particular of the particular pictures.
You have a model of the Earth that emerge.
Think about this as a long work of Stephen Lawler on Earth on the virtual Earth
It's something that grows in complexity growing people that are using people to us. And the vantages to people us.
Their picture are married with metaphot with other people.
If somebody is to connect all these these guys says that I saw the name of the name of Notage Dimprove Dimmers of all those dates, and I can use all those data, and I can use a point of engineering for the engineer in the space, in that universe, in that universe, in that universe, and a little bit of the typ-user of the type of the type of the type and cross-user type of the sket-user cross-user cross-user.
In course, a consequence of all this is extremely elaborated every part of the Earth, not only by view of the land and and sland and and satellitaries and satellitaries and similar images of the collective memory of the collective virtual consequence.
Thank you very much.
World World World Well what your software that your software going to do is that a certain point, in the next few years, all the photographs are going to be practically colleged together?
BA: Yeah. What is doing in practice is found it.
It is creating creating hyperlin, if you want to be in imagines.
And it's doing it is doing it in the content of the images.
And the thing becomes very interesting if you think about the information of information that many of these images that many of these images that are possibly going to be able to do it.
As when you make a research of images on the web, and the pay on the web pages on the web pages of the photos.
Now, what happens if that picture is colleges you all the voice of your phote?
So the amount of interconnection, which is a lot of seedy and the amount of retly that is really enormous amount of retly.
CA: Blaise, it's really incredible.
BA: I thank you so much.
One of the major patterns when you travel and one of the research of research between who has not dimentically the anti-traditions, who has not dimentically the anti-dle led the pasts of the pasts of the plants in the middle of the gams and lots of the logical research of the game of the lock of the research.
Basts think that sciamans Jaguar still over the Viiian of the Lattea, or which mythes are still holds mythes me meanings of means of meanings of means, or Himalaya, the good drogen that the importance of the amount of the ants of the amazing world of the ants of the world that we live in sense of the world that we are not in sense of the same sense of the same sense of the models of the world of the world of the gamount of the world of the world of the world --
the consequence of a particular choices of adaptations that our stirps or mals, many generations agreed.
And, of course, we all share of essential tracth.
We all all of it. We all procreive it.
We're dreams to reach beginning.
We have to face the inexorsible inexorse of morts, so we don't have to clean and balliamous --
We have a art of us --
What you have colpieces is the ritritical ritritual dog, the ritm of every culture.
It doesn't matter that are the forest of the Borneo, or the Voodoo the Voodoo of Haity, or the war of the desert Kaisut in Kenya settrial settrial camels in the heart of the Sahara.
He was my companies of my journey in desert a month ago, or a month, or a yak in the glass of the world. And the Everest, the demother of the world.
All these populations teaching us that are other ways of existing other ways of thinking, other ways of thinking, other ways of thinking, other ways of thinking, other ways of thinking, other ways of thinking, other ways of thinking, other other ways of thinking, other other ways of thinking, other ways of thinking about other ways of thinking, other ways of thinking, other ways of thinking, other ways of thinking, other people.
And, if you get a mind, is a concept that can give you hope.
And in the miriddle of cultures of the world create a ragnant life spiritual life that was a planet and cultural biods of the planet and is importantly a name of the world as a rab ness as a raise nurfera.
And you can think about this ragnatela cultural as a nice of the planet as a total nness of all the concept of all the concept of all the concept of all the concept of human consciousness to be from human consciousness to be from human conflected by the consciousness of consciousness of consciousness --
The fantastic is the fantastic patrimonths of human human human reality.
It's the symbulult of what we can be as a species of what we can be as a species of what we can be as a kind of what we can be in how it is that we can be in how inquisist of what we can be in the kind of of what we can be in the species of what we can be in how inquise.
And as the biosphered was graving to otherwise as it was happened to the etness and purtrouble is very quicker and purtrouble.
No biology, for example, it would say 500 percent of all the species is about the extinction of the extinction of the extinct -- in the most apoorest -- in the most addresss -- and not near ar the popular countries -- that of the most addressed by the most of the cultural diversity of the cultural diversity -- that of the cultural diversity --
The indict of all is, of course, the perditional language.
When you're bored to be 6,000 languages on this planet.
A language is not just by a vocabolary or a vocabolary or a series of rules of the gram of the mathemthem,
One is a language of human spirit of human spirit of human spiris.
It's the mean the mean the half of every culture, is in the world in material world.
Every enginua is a forest of mind, a nice ice indeed, a piece of inspiritual possible system of the spiritual.
And those 6,000 languages -- as we are here to Monterey, alleast the half is not sussurgered in the orecks.
They don't have more teacher to children, which means less than anything, which is already morted.
What is more tristand of being avvolved by the silence, of being the last to talk about a language of the English, not to transmit the evidence of the efloor of the ancesty?
This is a found of somebody in some part of the world every two weeks every two weeks of the world every two weeks and with the skombs and with the sland with a ancient language.
And I know what somebody will say "It's not better like this?
The world would not be a better place if we talk about the same language -- we talk about this is yoruba. We are all around yoruba. We are all locants --
We look at the point of it.
Scover a track thing that means not to talk about their language.
And I would like to do a journey through the etner --
a little journey in the glass of what we're lost to give you a little bit of what we're loying.
Many of us of us forgoes that when I say "different ways of existers," I mean, really different ways of existers.
We can make for example, this bird Barasana, in Amazon the population of anonial anonda, which created to the middle of the milk of the milk of the milk of the sacrips of the sacrips of the sacride of the ployear of the anonish.
This is a population that is not in a population of the blue color, because the celests is identifed in the forest, which is identify in the forest, which is hold.
They have a strange strange and a remonial regular regular English, "English, you know, to have a person that park a person that parent.
And it all has radicated in the past mythological -- all the particularity is that in these families are are six or sets are are about six or sets in the mists of the mysts nobody practice of a language.
They limiting to listen and then they start talking about this.
We can make one of the most interesting tribest I lived with which I lived Woranans of Ecuador nor, a popular population that has been prime in 1958.
In 1957 mission of 1957 mission of a committed connected error.
They did drop from the treats that they were running them in poor that they were involved to love that this population of the forest forest of the forest of the forest of bi-dimensional forest.
They have a picture of the photographs to researching to a form or a shape or a shape of a shape that it was deavistration that was diavoid five mission with the similarge.
But Waorans don't just the strange him.
They killed in them.
55 percent of deaths was because of their mortality was because of their own own own own mortality was for their mortality was for their mortality was about their mortality was because of their mortality was because of their mortality was because of their mortality was because of their own mortality was because of their mortality was because of the dead for 54 percent of the death.
We are rised to eight generations and we found two cases of natural death and when we insisted for us to know, they have a lot of them was dead, and then they have been dead, and then they have killed it was instead, and then they have a knowledge of the forest death.
The cycles were able to recognizing the urina animal urina and recognized species.

The solution is, you take 17 variety in a night of a hunt and each other.
With this is not to Harvard, but it's much more interesting than the ames.
Now, the problem is that the problem is that people have to be the popular popules of indigenes and in some way to the sea reduced way to the sea story of real-spect of the world of our real, and past drive to our real world and drop to the world and the drop of the real--to-reduced and the problem of us that are reduced by the set of the real-inner rected butes of us that are in the world of the realong the world
In fact, the 20th century, in 300 years, not going to true the innovation or the innovation or innovation -- but plutting as the innovation of the innovation of the innovation of mabbraced and we have stopped the destruction of the biological diversity of the biological problem is not the change.
All the cultures are involved in a slight-to-hand-to-life.
And the problem is not the technology.
Indian American Sioux have not stopped to be Sioux when they have been med by Americans are not as the Americans have no matter to be Americans when they have been med by cave.

This is a story that I don't suggests that we have the answers that we have to realize in the millennia.
When these myriasis of cultures what it wants to say to be human being, to be human, and you can have a different voices.
And it's in these answers that we all response to be what we can be what we love to be what we love with a consciousness and all the popules and all the popules and all the popules of a great moments of eight-type moments of a type of a type of a type of being what we are.
I took this picture on the north of the north of Babin, when I went to the hunt of the walks with Island with the "Shya, I told the beautiful story of his grandmother.

One of the plended example of how a national country of a national popular with his popular popul.
And, in the finally, I think it's pretty obvious at least to people who are in these areas of the planet, making of the planet, making that not remote remots.
For somebody is home.
They represented the imagination of human imagination that are at the time of the themes of these children, as every children, as the sky of our children, become part of the geography of the hope.
Finally, we have National Geographic we are convinced that politicians will never get anything to nothing --
We think the polemizes --

Our rivists are literally lets to millions of people.
Our work is to travel in the vacuum to bring our public in places of which is the cultural community from which is going to go to the reveal reveal elected as they saw to the reveveal elections of the world -- and we have to find a hundred of life in the diversity, and we have to find a place of lifestyle, and mulral multural of lifestyle,
which is that the set of all popules populations can contribbuting to our benefit to our benefit to our benefit to our benefit to our benefit to our benefit to our benefit to our benefit to our benefits to our bend benefit to our benefit to our benefit to our benefit to our benefits of all the populses of the popull wisdom of all the popull wisdoms.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some things that I written in this book that I hope to be able and provide and provery, very provide and provide some of college college in the case not us.
I want to start with what I call "the dog, "Like dog,
The official dog, the official dog,
The official dog, the official society of the Western Western the West: "If we want to massimizing the bend of our citizens to be a freedom to be a freedomyzing the freedom liberty."
The reason that is that the liberty is in the fact that liberty is in the same kind of value, is precious value, to human beings.
Another in the fact that if we are liber, each of us can act to do everything that massimizes our benefits, without any one that decided in our none of our well.
The way to massimizing the liberty is to massimizing the choice.
More choices people hannow, more liber, more than their free, more than their freedom, most of them is their beneaters.
This is a deep inspiring in the society that nobody would have to put it in the two-hundred it in two-hand-hundred it in two-hand-hold.
And it's also foundly radicated in our lives.
I'm going to show you some examples of what the progress has possible.
This is my supermarket. It's not particularly big it.
I allowed a simple named a hundred conditions.
In my surmarket are 175 conditions, without contributed the 10 variets of olive olies and 12 acets that you can buy to a number of enormous conditions, which is a huge number of constants in the scientists that nobody of your own degree.
Here's coming the supermarket.
Then you go to the negotio to buy a stere: cassroom CD, radio, piast, radio, piast, the lifire.
And in this single snegotio of electronic components of carefully car.
We can make six million different combinations of different combinations that are in a negotic negotid.
You have to love that there is a lot of choice.
Other camp: the world of communications.
One of a child, when I was a child, they could get all the services of the phons wish wish that were shaped by mamma Bell.
He was reading the phone, not buy it was buying it.
A consequence of that, in the way, was that the telephone is that the phone is not broken maes.
These are gandated.
Now we have a variety almost most illitimitated by the way, specially between cells.
Here's the cells of the future.
My favorite is in the middle of MP3, and the forest of the nase, and force in the crisms is,
If I house you don't have seen in the case, you're drinking, you're going to predict that pretty much of it.
And what happens is that people on the negozes in the negozes and this question and this question is "No."
It's not possible to buy a cellular that I don't do too much things.
So, in other aspects of life that are very important than the water expects of the water explosion of choices.
Assistance, not happened in the United States that you have to do you from doctor and the doctor and the doctor what to do.
And I mean, I go from doctor, and the doctor, "OK, we could do A, "Okay, we can do A, "Like these wells and these responsss." And these responsss."
You say, "Dotor you, what I should do?"
And the doctor says, "As these wells and these answers and these respons."
"What do you want to do that?"
And you can get it was to the well--- "Dr.
And the doctor: "But I'm not lei."
The result of the result called the malato," expression that makes it seems a beautiful thing.
But in fact, it's not that one is that a slighty and responsibility to take decisions that something that knows what something that is that anything that is not a -- and so quite certain is not a -- and so not in the conditional conditional decisional to take decisional decisional that is a patient.
There's a huge marketing providence to do drugs, I direct to people like me and you, if you think we don't buy that we can't buy it.
But if we can't buy it -- why do we public for you?
The answer is that they want to do the doctor of changing to change the doctors.
And so foundation as a foundation of choice, as you see in this view of choice, and we can not want to force, "We don't want to force, they will not want to force, we will not be an involved more identity -- we have to invent.
And we can invention how many times you can make us again us.
What means that every morning, you have to decide that you have to decide that kind of person wants to be there.
And I realized to the family and matrimoni, a time perspective, and it was that we had to be able to the most possible, and it was beginning to the most predict possible, and it was beginning to the most predict possible.
The only only truth was with choices -- not here, not the one thing that do later.
Ogo, everything is really to play.
I think about a very intelligent students and the 20 percent work in less of a time working in a time time to a time.
And because they're not brilliant less because they're not less deliged to be brilliant diligents.
But why I'm impensive to ask ask me to ask me I said, "I would do you this? I would do it right now, I would do it right now, I would do it right no?"
"What I would have to be able to you? I thought I before I have to think about the carer?"
I'm interrogatives logant interrogant interroom.
And they try to answer these questions, even though this questions, even though not completely to get a voice of your home and not to get a voice to my exam.
And they have to do that. I'm questioning about this.
Now, the work: we have lucky, as Carl in the untoleava, because technology we lost every single day, every day, every day, every single day, every single of the planet, from Hotel Randolphph.
It was talking about it, and there's a corn, and I'm not going to tell anybody where Wii work.
I don't have to say that, because I want to use it.
What mean, this incredible liberty of choices that we have to work or decision, what we have to decide we have to work or not.
We can go to see our child play to play hoke, with the cell phones in the other, Blackberry in the other, and the nurse, the niture of the eye.
And even though I'm all of, every minutes that we see our child that we can also say, "I have to say, "I have to answer this called ata?"
"I have to answer this email? I got to him?
And even when the answer is "nothing this makes experience of your own own child to the test of what it would be in other conditions.
So, from any part of that, things about this, small things, small objects and stils, life is a lot of choices and life, life is a question of choice.
Once the world was this -- there were some possibly possibly possibly possibly deed this choice.
The world today is that this is a positive thing is, "It's a positive thing is, "It's a positive thing or negative, or negative?"
The answer is She's She's Sh.
The slide of them we know everybody, so I'm talking about those negatives.
All this choice behaviors two negative effects on the people.
The primary, paradoxies, is that they have to talk about liberation.
With the floor of the chood, becomes very difficult to do this.
I mean, a mean an an example of mean to think of the works.
My college was access to the data of the Vanciese, the gants of though companies of thought, with about a million clients of a clients in 2,000 different companies.
What she found is that that she found is that every 10 solutions that are offered in the more, the percentage of adescribes of the 2-percent.
With 50 sources -- there's 10 percent in less than adesions are available to when they are available to only 5. Why?
Because with 50 sources that chook, is maledetail, is the choice is is remaking, and choice is remained to the inquestion is remaintains.
And at the question questions, and I asked questions, and of course, and of course,
You know, as it doesn't just mean that these workers will eat lose to cans because they don't have enough money, it means that the decision is so ostic that decision is so ostic that decision is so ostic fundamental data of work.
Don't theiping to 5000-dollars to work from the dator of work, which would be drunning to the sense of the work, which would be a track to the conversation.
So the parality is a consequence of having too many choice.
And I think that makes the world like this.
"And finally, for the eternitity: ketchup, sense and or major major major major major major major mains?"
You will take the right decision to take the right decision -- if it's for the age of eternitity, right?
You don't want to choose the source source, and neps the wrong condition.
So this is the first effect. The second is that if we can evitself the parals, we end up to the paralysis of how we will be able to be able to be able to be able to be with less with less options of how we will be able to be able to be able to be able to evitself.
And this is a different reasons.
One of these is that with a lot of conditions, whether you know, if you buy a and not perfect and it's not a perfect that you might have a choice that would be better than it would be better than it would be better than it would be better than the treatment of imagined imagined and the recent of the choice, and the receiving of the decision of the rectent decision of the decision of the decision of the decision of the decision of the decision
even when it was a decision.
More choices -- more easy than anybody who detakes us anybody details of the choice.
Inoland, there's what economists called the coscost of opportunity.
Dan Gilbert asked a very well stampline as the value of things that we confrontic value to what we confrontic with which we confrontic things we confrontive to things that we confrontive to things that we confrontic values that we confrontive to things that we confront with what we confront of things that we confrontive to the things that we confront of what we confront of what we confrontic value value value value to what the value of the value of what we are conse.
In the case of that, when there are possibly possibly possibly represented the caristic carries of alternative trees and be less than the options of options that is choice.
Here's a example. I usually with all the people that are not in New York.
But it's what probably probably thinking.
There's this copy of Hamptons.
A place of sush.
It is splendia. Otyma day.
Not anything that he thinks is, "Well, what he thinks is, "Well, Austo."
"Everybody all my neighbors are vie."
"I could talk about my front of my front of home."
And the past two weeks assilled by the idea that is lost -- every day, every day, the possibility of parking where it want.
The cost-opportunity diminuished the soddddisplace for what we have been excellent.
And the more of the options we have to consider the most of the rest that are going to recognized as a cost-opportunity to be constantly as a couple of opportunity that we have to recognized us as a cost-opportunity that we will be constants that we will look at the more of the rest of the expen-opportunity.
Here's another example.
This view tells us a lot of things.
And it talks about the moment, and maybe live to live slowly.
But the most importantly, is that anything you can choice, you know, you choices to do not do the other.
The things that we don't have a lot of four active that can make less less what we do.
Tero point, you spiral growing of the expects.
I tried on my skins of my ball of jeans.
I was almost always jeans.
Once jeans were just a type of a type and vestically, were comods, only after we have a lot of a lot of worked and worked and worked to go well.
So, I went to buy a couple of a new time when those old were gathered and said, "I need a couple of jeans, this is my cute."
And I said, "Like wants to be slim -- "Like and phit?"
He wants with the cernic or with the bottonight? "Stone," or """Yes," or ""Yes?
"Like it want?"
"Sotbroke them or stret? Bla blak the blak -- Continured to the blak of the bladed.
I was sleep, and after a little I could say, "I want to want to say, "I want to the kind of -- that was the only one of which was that I was so so I tried all the same disease jeans, then I tried all the games of the negood, with the best jeans that I had ever been able to the best of jeans that I had ever ever ever ever ever ever happened to say, "I don't have that.
It was the mas. With all that choice had to get the meet.
But I heard I heard I worse I heard I heard I heard I heard I heard I heard I heard I heard I heard I heard I heard I heard of it.
because I wrote a book interor to understand that.
The reason I was worse is that I was worse with the midle of my aspectations were loaltis; the jeans had to be perfects.
I had a beginning to expecttly. I didn't expected, when I was just a type of a type of 100 different guys had to be perfect.
What I had water was good -- but not perfectly --
After I was talking about what I was trying to mean that I was trying to confront of what I was trying to confront to the expectative.
The add of options in life of people who don't forward the expectations that these have respectations of the options.
And this will be less to be sodddisft, even when the results are good people.
No one in the world of marketing if you make it contried.
Because if you know what I'm talking about, I don't know what I'm talking about.
The truth versus more like this.
"He was working as it was worse when it was worse when it was worse when it was worse when it was worse when it was still possible when it was still possible to met the precise of precise surprised preployed of evolved precise evolved to evolved to mean that when it was still possible when it was wor
Ogo, in the world where we live -- opulent, industrialized citizens with the perfection -- the massisixm that we can hope is that things are in the performing of the expects.
You never have to be surprised to be expectative, the milittle, the middle of expectative.
The secret of happiness -- what you're here -- "Yes, "Yes, "Yes, "Yes, you want to get it up."
I mean, little moment I mean, a little moment -- which is really hunted and my wife is really stuff.
I don't have to do better and I don't have to do my own own own --
But I don't always have a good thing.
And finally, a consequence of the buy jeans of jeans of when there is only that jeans is that when you're not going to be in fact, and you say, "Why is you know, "Why is you know, "Why is you know, "Why are you going to be able to be a couple of the jeans of the jeans
"Who is responsible to the answer is clear.
The world is responsible responsible to us?
When there are hundreds of jeans, and you buy a insoddds, and you ask you who is responsible to you know, the responsible is that the responsible is that the responsible is that you are there.
You might be able to do better.
With hundreds of variety of available -- there are not to success.
So when people take decisions, even though the result is walked in the result is that they were insods and they have the colate colate their own own own own own own own own own beings.
In the last years the last years depression is exploded in the industrialized world in the industrialized world
I think that a meaning -- I don't have the universe -- not the universe -- of this depression is that people have to depression is too much -- because the deludent standard are too alties.
And when they explained this situation thinking that colped the colp.
So the final result is that in general result, we are making, but we feel worse about it.
Let me tell you about it.
This is the official dog, what we all take for good and it's completely false.
There's no two--to-that a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a choice is a lot better than a popull of a point of a point of a popular than a popular point.
There's a critical value, I don't know what I know.
But I'm sure we have super-sure that we have super--piece where the electric choices are our life.
Now, from the political point -- I have almost -- from the view of the policy, the clean is follow.
What allows you to all this choice in society is the recket.
There's a lot of places in the world, and you know that the problem isn't that they have a choice.
The problem is that they too popular too popular is that they have too popular the problem is that they too popular the problem is that they too poay.
So the face that I'm talking about is a diesclusive to the modern, which society society that society is a Western societies.
And what makes you depress and arrabbbing is this is, Steve Levitt me talk about how those costs are involved and comods of segen to birds for bills are involved to money.
I mean, I mean, that these choices, complicated and dispendent and dispendent inus.
They're the deleteries.
They're going to make worse worse
If a little bit of what in our society is perhaps lomet, which people have too population was in those where people have too popular love, not only the news.
This is what economists call a better paretic pareties are a better paret.
A redistributional redistributed -- not just to poor -- because of this choice -- because of this choice in except that we go back to us.
And he said, "Lik, you can become all of what you want, "...
You know, people of culture, thought, "But what it thinking, "But what the weigh?"
"It's obvious that you can't make it in a mouse of vetrock."
"As a cool view vision of the world."
and I was the interpretty much about this, at the beginning.
But then, I think, I think, I realized that fish the long time.
Because the reality of facts is that if you eat the frankly, the book, and so that "all of the liberty. It's possible," it is a parals.
If you rom the mouse of the eyes that all becomes possible to diminum soddddddata the soddds.
All the parals, and you reduce the well.
Everybody needs a sfer.
This is almost certainly too stretly, perhaps even for the fish, and safe for us.
But the absorce of some symbolic square a received for infected infected to the rove.
Thank you very much.
