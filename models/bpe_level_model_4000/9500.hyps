The year I spent these slides to show that the caloes to show that the calotic actice, which for almost three million years of the 48 Can Can Can Can Can Can Can Can Can Can Can Can an an Can an an an continents,
But this subject of the gravity of the problem because it doesn't exhihip of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice problem.
The calotic calculator, in a certain sense, the heart of the climath of the climate.
You go to the inverse and you get the extremendous and you get the extremendous of the extremendous and you get the extremendous and you get the extremendous and you get the extinct.
The next devices will be a rapid paper is going to be a rapid of the last 25 years.
The ice is lost of them are the signed in red red in red red by the red of the be.
As you see it, you go to the blue blue blue box
That's the ice in inver, which you get the ice in the extremendous time.
You can see the cosident that the cosident coside, it's like the blood, which is like the blood, which is like the corpore.
In 25 years is spent from this like like this.
This is a problem because the rewarming the ground of the ocean and the ground of the ocean artical amount of carbon on on the ocean that we go into the microbies.
And I think about the totality of the inquination of the global warming of global warming, surrow this point of the way could not reach that point of not report.
In some deep deep in Alaska a meters are already reboaring from water.
The professoreful professorethy of Alaska was rected with a team with a team that was a team that was a little bit of the last invernnnal last invernnal in the last device.
Video: Wow! At the question is if you are going to be going to be in us.
A reason is that this scale of the termal scale of the north.
This is a fume glacial records of glacial.
The door was never reached in the side.
This is the phume Kangerussua's the souththetime of the Groenlushhhelmy.
If you want to know how the level of the sex of the sex of the ice of the sea a mart.
These are increasing very quickly.
On the other part of the planet: Antartical block of the planet.
The month of the scientists have died that the bibillyming the ice is in negative, and that Antarcticle of the slummms, which is particularly very quickly at the degrees in the monkept in the sciouse.
And it looks like six feet of water, as in Groenlyms.
Of course, the third biggest and the third of the ice of ice ice ice ice of ice and they can see new laghand, who were ice ice ice --
The 40-percent of the world's population of the water water from the water from what it was going to proud of the pockey to the mondial of the world's population of the world's population of the pockey of the pockey to the ground of the world's population of the world's population of the world's population of the world's population of
South Ande: this ice is the foundation of the water water of the water of the poccities.
The portraised is increased.
But when he dimine it, the same happens.
In California neve on Sierra Nevaada is diminual dimine of the 40-percent.
The hydrops.
The previsions, as you know, I'm gravited with that.
The growing growing in the world door sexual sen the author sexual growing of the window in the world door.
The disastring environmental environmental environmental and not precedent and without precedents.
Four most numbers more numbers in the last 30 years of precedent years
This is a gand-and-and-and-like another.
If you look at the context of the history if you can see the constant.
In the last five years we added 70 million tons of tons of CO2 to 24 hours in the oceans every day.
Look at the Pacific, by the Amermer, by the Amermer, to the Amermer, and on the subcontinent -- where there is a radical rootal area.
The larger of the global warming and the deforestation, and the deforestation, which is the use of comburies of common.
The oil is a problem, and the carbon is even worse worse
The United States are one of the most emissions, with the Cina.
And it was propond of building a carbon to the carbon on
But we're assisting a change of direction.
These are the projects of the last years and some of the last few years and alternative proposition.
And then I think there's a lotttty in our Pahhhouse.
The carbon industry and oil has spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote the carbon the last year to promote the carbon the last year for a hospital.
That image me me to something,
I mean, Natal, in the Tennespecially in the Tennespecial of 3.8 billion miles of gone of the carbon.
Maybe you have seen the news of news ars.
This is the second second big fluses in America.
It's success around Nat.
The publishing adverties of a carbon industry of the industry.
Video: Look, Frosty the carbon is a kind of cool.
It's got a lot of like America, and it makes our economy.
Frosty the carbon is always more clear to the be.
It's a good pregnant pregnable and the work work and the work work workers are depend.
Al Gore: From here is part of the West Virginia.
The most great society to the mountain in the mountay of the mountay of the monstrator.
Video: Good Blankenship: Sarmed -- Al Gor, Nancy of the Nancy of the Reid -- not know what they're talking about.
Al Gore: So the Alleance for the Protetion of the Clia a two campaign.
This is a kind of a be, a part.
Video: ALergi: The ALergic we see the changes as a serserable to our businesses.
So this is to invest a big amount of money in a big amount of money in a sforce to make public and construction to make public and construction in the carbon on the carbon.
In fact, the carbon is not spore.
We think it's a lit -- it also a good profue.
So not preocus of climate change
Let me do that we do.
Video: Atton the Can you heard -- you know, you heard a lot of it.
So we can do a whole structure in a structure of the carbon as as much as a be.
Straordinary cars are a little rorororoads of the technology, but this is the suit of the technology.
The main of the main is between the main of the global warming, but the night, but the night-scale that you see changes that you see changes that you see change.
Date a eye -- this is the odiern technology of carbon technology.
Al Gore: Infine, the alternative alternative to the economic issues and the economic of the national security and the physics of the national security.
Video: The ment: The economy, the economy, the economy, the economy, the economy, the crisis.
The film that the connects the whole thing is our dependence from the cooking and oil is the cooking and oil oil oil oil and oil oil oil oil oil oil oil oil oil oil oil
Now, even though I have a new way, to use solution for uscirce.
Real America: 100 percent of energy in did.
A plan to report America to work and make us more physics and help us to help the global warming the global warming.
Finally, a solution that basts to solve our problems.
You're America. Scover America.
Al Gore: This is the ultimate one.
Video: Comment: You know, it's reduce to America.
One of the most quickest ways of the dependence of the dependence from the dependence that we kill our planet.
Comparsa: The future is here. The future -- -- sole, a new energy.
Number two: Nuoves for places to work for a lot of work for jobs.
Comment: Repower America. It's time to be realists.
Al Gore: A old proverbio African old African old African old Kian is to go to the money -- you go to the money to solve them.
If you want to go back to the hand go together."
We have to go back to the time.
Thank you very much.
The year at TED 10 to a introduction on LHC.
And it turns out to the paper to the car.
So I was not a little bit of the other time I don't have to have no longer scientific experiment -- 27 miles -- 27 miles of circirccle.
Her is to reach the reactive conditions that were present to 600 million times at the beginning of the universe -- to 600 million times at the second -- to 600 million times at the second -- to 600 million times at the second way to 600 million times a second.
All of course, it's simply the environment.
This is the machine machine ine ine machine ine machine ine ine machine ine ine machine.
We can do these mini-Big Bang in the rise of the rise of the rise of the rise of the rise of the mini-Big Bang Bang in the rise of the mini-Big Bang Bang in the detect of these mini-Big Bang in the rise of the
This is what I work to work -- it's called ATLAS -- it's larg-foot diametets.
This is a picture of ATLADATLAS in built so you can see the proportion of proportion
The 10 sectors of the last year we have accesoid the car for the first time.
And this picture was taken by ATLATLATLA.
It was because of immense to immense in the healthy of control.
It's a first fashion that was a particles that had done all the around the LHC, in collision, deliberately, with a part of the LHC, and spread particularly particularly particularly particularly particular.
In other words, when you see that image the 10 sector, we understand that the machine machine that is a great liver lives.
I don't know if it was going to do us more opposed to do that when someone went to Google and vide that the pages that pay was like this.
What it means we had a culture of the scientific impact of the scientific scientific impact
And I was a week of later, it was a problem with the car, just to these films here -- these films of these films -- these films of the films of the cars.
These files are a 13,000 feet when the car workers workers at the massive massive of the pot.
Now, the technicians in the movies of you look at the movies and they say, "It's not true. I'm going to be too underly."
And instead they can do it because they are very freedom to the superconducductors.
So, at least 271 graps, to a temperature in the stellow of the spaces between the stelles, these films can bring that cut the right of the room.
In one of the most of the most of the nest in the LHC, there was a dift of fabrication.
So the filmed surgeon and 13,000 feet and 13,000 feet of suddenly meet a resistence electrics.
This was the result of the result.
Now, this is still more impressive if you think that these magnets, and that are slower than 20 tons of about 30 centimetris.
And it's damed about 50 magnets.
We had to take them to do it, what we did we do.
We have repristed and and raised and thupon the ust.
Now, they're coming back to their own feet all the subject.
English the end of the mart of the mart of the inteer.
And then we accend, and we think we can get to the right or or him, and continue to find out what the morning to find what the morning in the morning that expensive to find what the universe.
Now, of course, in a certain certain way, these are reaching the debate of the science and engineering the engineer of science and engineering the engineering of the engineering and engineering by confutterly to confut.
I think the fact that the fact that it's so difficult to go over the limits, I think this is the valuable of things like LHC.
I want to conclude with a scientist, the Inglacific Inglacific Ingly, the qual, I guy, I think, in difesa of inethy experiments of his pullill, his pullist is so dangerous for the human minute for the human minute of human minute as the revenues as the requires of human minds as the defingers of nature, which is not to have to be a new new month of our trigging --
Thank you.
I want to start to ask you to start to report to me to start to ask the morning morning.
As you can see how to reach them and the errars, and they learn how to think about it, and they learn how to think and solve the way to think and the way you can resolve to space.
The reasonable reasoning is deep connected to the way we understand the world around us.
So, by informate, by the useful of our interaction with objects with objects of my construction with my construction of my collaborator Jeevan Kalanitha, I started asking asking her, I started asking to have a computer, instead of a mic demonstration of the mouse that is a little bit of the deal with a little error that we could have a little little bit of erring the mistake with a certain certain of the conversation of the construct of the device,
and we can do our pleasure to our pleasure to our please.
The question was so interesting that I decided to explore the answer, built the answer, built the Siftable.
And in a few words, a Siftable computer is a whole computer as a biquote as a biquote as a biquote as a biquote as a Sifty computer.
And in a few words, a Siftable computer is a whole computer as a biquote as a biquote as a biquote as a biquote as a Sifty computer.
You can move with the hand, they can see the hand, they can see the right movement and they feel the movement, and a radio wireless and a radio wireless and a radio wireless and a radio wireless of the hold and a radio wireless and a radio wireless to the hand.
But most of course, I'm objects like the morning morning, as the morning, you can move to the mistakes.
The Siftable of a new ecost of a new ecost for manipulation to the digital information.
And as they become more physics, conscious and they knew the right movement, and they become more physicists, and they become more physicists, and they become more physicists, as they are exploring new and different different and functions.
I'm going to start with a simple example.
This Siftable is configured to show you of the video, if you can go to a direction, if you walk up the video root of the other part of the other part of the other part of the back.
These ritrates are conscious interactive of others.
If they are interested in in the ise of them are interested in what they are going to be done.
If they get a little bit and they can go a pock and they can agite.
If they get a little bit and they can go a pock and they can agite.
They also have their movement, and they also have their movement.
And then we realize that one of the interaction of the interaction was the able to use the data, to example, "vers" a flue of the data, as if it was a flu.
In this case, we have three Sifty configured as a several and I can use them to the surface of the color of the color in the central surface in the central of the color and I can use them to the surface of the color and I can use them to the surface of the color of the color of the color of the color of the color
and I can use them to the color of the color of the central colors.
If we can get a little bit of it, we can reform a little bit of the way.
I'm also beautiful, as a kind of apapaptop, as the language, and mathematics and playing the people can try and see the things that you can try and see the results.
Now I'm going to --
This is a Fibonaces that I do with a program of equations.
Here we have a park of parts that is a half between Scarabeo and Boggle.
Prate, in every turnnner, in case on every Siftable, Prate, Pratically, to every turnner, Prate, and then you try to be in a case, and when he trip to a drug of a drug of a drug on a drug of a drug in a country.
And then after about 30 seconds of them remiss and you have a new chance to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to
Thank you.
Here's what I got to the children came to the Middle Lab, I did it in a video video -- I did a video.
And they are pleasure a lot of it.
And one of the interesting interesting of this is that you can't have to do many people to do many of the instruments.
You just say, "Compons of the parole," and they know what they do.
Here's what you want to do they trial.
This is our poct young people -- there at the young people to dealth.
And it actually wanted to be just a clear.
They just morning to him.
Now, this is an apply an interactive activity.
We wanted to build a tool-to build a tool-to the layer of the ling's Flix.
It can insert new characters in the scene, the Sifest their associated with their associated --
It can insert new characters in the scene, the Sifest their associated with their associated --
So it's doing the sold of the sold.
Video: The sole is surging.
David Merrill: Now he took a tree in the scene.
Video: The tree treatment to the very treat.
Bel work! Y! Y!
So schools in Siftable and put them up and put the characters --
Video: Bau!
And by the story of your story.
Video: Ho!
DM: It's a story with the open and it can decide it as you can decide it as you can decide it as you can decide it as you can decide it as a concer.
DM: It's a story with the open and it can decide it as you can decide it as you can decide it as you can decide it as you can decide it as a concer.
Volo: Vule, gat, gat.
DM: The last example I have time to show you is a tool, I did that was a tool, to be a tool, to the music and exeguing music.
It's a tool, I did that recently, to campioning and exeguing music.
The Siftable here are going to be like the bottom and bacteria as a low-based and bacteria
Each of these has four different variations and you can choot what use ushing what using it.
You can insert these sounds in a consequence from a comporate concerned with your please.
And it just just to touch a "sound a "sound to play a "Red."
These are actually you can control from live in the rivers and the films.
You attack who in a suit to a particular and then sinct for the framework for the framework for the folks to a suit to a very sound and then you can save it in a suit to a very sound and then you can go to a particular and then you attacks to a particular and then you can keep it.
And then there are the general as time and fly and fly to the inter-sequence.
Let's look like this.
Video: F: We're going to put a basic in two Siftable in two Siftable "sequency," we add in a series, the extend to add out of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom in a series, the other cost in a series, the other bottom in a serious series, the extend of the things we can go into a serie,
Now I just put a blow.
Video: Now, I added to add percent use --
Video: And now I'll put the filter to the bacteria, so I can control the effect from live in the living here.
Video: I can speak the whole to sequence the whole sequence of the time to the other side or from the other.
Video: And I will add the movie to add the bottom to the bottom to give more expression.
Video: I can recombined the sequence ""You can refly the volo."
So I don't have to planning the primar, but I can sudden, but I can be sudden,
And now, I finally, I can sfuel the entire sequence of the left Siftable to the Sifty "volume."
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is to build new interfaces as a new interface, as they work as a workers as a workers as well.
And I have time to show you one of the results of this lost of this lost that we try to bring out of the lab of the lab of the lab of the lab of the lab of the lab of this lost of the lab of this lost of this lost of the lab of this lost of this lost of this lost of the lab of this is going to take you to show you out of the lab of this
The concept I want to transmit is that it's coming to the new generation of objects that are going to be able to interact with the digital media information in the way we want to do.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the time to talk about with all you.
I'm a written writing a write of the lyming.
And I want to be my profession exsion of course, is more than that, of course,
It's also the love and the friend of my life.
And I don't think that it can change it.
But said that, something like this is success in my life and my life and I was taken me to realibrate the whole whole whole relationship with this work.
The particular thing is I was that I was written this biography called "Mangia, Prega, Prega, Prega, Prega, Prega, and I was a very much of my precedent book, for some of the world and become a big big big mother's interaction.
And the result is that everywhwhere, people who were condition as if you were condition as if you were condition as if you were condition to it.
It was a real -- condition -- condition --
They are they going to be doing all worried and say, "You can't do anymore, "You can't do better.
You don't have to keep to write to write to write to make a book that could make a book that you can do somebody?"
what can you do to somebody?"
It's rassically, you know, you know.
But it could go worse -- I remember what I remember that more than 20 years ago, when I started to say people -- I was a written to be a written to be a written written a trick write trick.
I was going to be in the same reaction from the country.
And people say, "You don't have to have to have to have success?
You don't have a paper that the million-refted to kill it?
You don't have to do this mestiate for all life without life that they never come out and didn’t got to a cut of saving a cumulation of saving the blood of love to love a failing blood?"
Yes, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know.
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is ""Yes."
Si.I have been papers of all of the things.
I always had a paper per per too.
And I also have a lot of other things that people could not ind.
As you can the other things and other things that you can get out.
But for how to write what I was writing what I was I ask me to the timate timate timate to me what is be?
Is it rational ration?
It's logiven that anyone who has to be shopped by a work that you can get to do.
But what is that we have to make it in the imprese that you can make it about the healthy of minds in a way that other career in a way that other carrier is not fanno?
As my father, for example, he was a engineer and not remember a chimician and not remember a chaptops where he was asked if he had been engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer if he was asked if he had had been a checking king to be engineer if he had been a checking king chance and I was asked if they had
There was never -- that block of engineer than the engineer than the engineer of engineer than the engineer of engineer than the engineer of the engineer of the engineer of the engineer than the engineer of the engineer of the engineer of the engineer to the engineer of the engineer of the engineer engineer to be --
It was not going to work on this way.
Onestly, the engineers as a group as a group like they don't have certain certain acts of being alcouraged the reputation of being alcouraged to be alcourage depressive.
We wrote the reputation, and not only writers but creatives you a whole creatives of being enormously about being enormously reputting them as a huge instable,
And it's not going to look at the tristage or of the death of the magnifies that creative creative that only in the 1st century, only in the 1st century, and often often for them.
And also those who don't have been suicide that they are actually disappears to be really, in their done.
Norman Mailer, before I was in the last interview said, "Oh, my my book has killed me a little bit more than a little bit of more than a life. And a very much about the work of your life.
But we don't go to the top when we hear these things like because we heard these things that in some way we have completely interiorized and accepted the notion that creativity and the notion of them in a few way you guys and the art, and then the argue that the art, and then you will go to the hold --
And the question I want to bring to all of that is, are you agree with this ide?
And it's good for this thing -- because you can look at the centimeter to me not good,
I think it's odiose.
And I also think it's also dangerous and I don't want to see the next century.
I think it's better to encourage our big creative creative creative to live in the real creative creative and the whole creative creative and the whole creative minds of the creative creative and to traveling our big creating in the whole creative creative creative and I think it's better than the big creative creative creative to live in the big creating our big creative creating our big creativity.
And I certainly in my case, in my case, in my case, it would be very dangerous to that I was going to be able to be able to be able to date the circumstances in my career.
Of course, -- I think about 40 years.
I still have about four decade decade in me.
And it's very likely to be very likely to write that they will be right by the world as the work that used after the work that used after the work that I was going to be a very like.
I'm going to be slavery, because we are all the people here -- it's likely to my greatest successful is to my own shoulder.
Oh, Ges: Oh, Ges!
You know, this is the gene of thinking that door to do a person starting to the novel of the morning and I don't want to do it.
I would continue to go to do this work we go.
So, the question becoming in, what is it be?
And so I was several in a lot of reflected, which I can actually write to make a cool cool of creating a psychological costructure, right?
I wanted to find a distance of physics between me, which I wrote a consciousness to what I was written to what reaction is about what I was trying to do with all over the time, and I was trying to look at the time, trying to find other things to see if they could have have to look at the best and more than the best ideas and more blood and more more blood and more blood and more and more than the best and more blood and more and more blood and the best of the ideas and
about how to help people create the inerent inerent risks to create the inerent of creativity.
And that research me to the antics and antic, Roome and antics and antic, Roome.
Seguitems because it goes back to the circle and then you go back to the back.
Nellelements and antics and antic, people don't seem to believe that the creativity that creativity was initiitizity came to the men are initiitizens in the men are initiitiitizes -- people don't seem to believe that the creativity and old old old -- people don't seem to believe that the creativity and old and old old and old it would be able to be danger?
And it was thinking that the creativity was the several and that they come to the men from a few men from a few of distant and unknown and unknown and unknown distants.
The green were called these diggers of the creativity of creativity "demony."
Socrate, wonderful, wonderful that he was a demone that elargive to be a demelt of the mountain to get a demelt of the mountail.
The Romans were the same idea, but they call that the kind of spirit without a genius of the same thing.
The big thing is that the Romans, because the Romans, they didn't think about a kind of intelligence of intelligence
They had a genius that a kind of entity that he was living in the murs of the study of a study of a little bit like a artist, a little bit like the elf of the argue of the argue of the argue of the argue and modeling the result of that work to work of that work of that work of that work of that work --
Ectually, -- -- -- -- -- -- this is the distance of what I parked it -- that costructure, which you protect the results of your work from your work.
And all they knew that it was so that it work?
So the artists were proutons were proud of things, like for example, as for the too narcisides, right?
If your work was very excited to take it and all the mer, all the mer, all of the mer, all of the delights that I was helped by this genius to be able to be able to take it.
If your work fail, it wasn't all color, right?
And all of them knew that it was your genius to be a capacity to be a capacity of being a skill.
And so people han an ashion the Occident for a long time.
Then the Rince came and everything and everything change, and then nacked this great idea; we put the center of the universe in the middle of all the mysteries and no more to let by creatures that write is written by details that I write the details from details to detain the middle of the universe and the myself of the myth of the mysteries and the mysteries and the myths and the my
This was the principle of human human raissue, and people started thinking that creativity was going to think that creativity from the igradu.
And for the first time in history, you know, I was like to reference this or a genius like a genius rather than a person with a genius with a genius like a genius with the genius to reference that around, you know, I was like a genius to have a genius very much like a genius of the genius of the genius like a genium of genius
And I have to tell you, I think it was a big mistake
I think that allows to make somebody one person to create a simple person to create a recipe like a recipe of all the mysteries and the mysteries and requid the mysteries is a responsibility to give a filter that human.
It's like to ask someone to do the solve to the sole.
I Deform and I was completely the ear and I believe all these ingestiable to be force.
And I think it was this pression to have been destructed the artists in the past of the past of 500 years.
And, if this is true, and I think I will become the question and you?
Can we do it different?
And I was going to go back to a more antage of human relationship between human relationship and mystery and mystery
Or maybe not.
Maybe we can't get 500 years of thinking about 500 years of thinking about the worth of the worth of the worth of the worth of mind.
And there are people in the audience that would be legityed by the scientific scientific scientific scientific eths on the notion of the nice of the same fracked to the next to their projects.
And I'm going to be not going to be able to be able to be not going to be able to be able to wouldn't win this thing.
But the question I want to do is -- why you know, why you know, I would like to do it -- why I would you like to ask is -- why you know, I would like to do is -- why you know, is -- why you know, I would like to do it is --
Why don't I think about this way?
Because it has more sense of every other thing that I ever heard to explain to explain to explain the process of creativity.
And a process that as anyone that I ever tried to do something -- so much of that, all here -- -- -- I don't think about it in rational terms of mind.
And, in fact, you know, you can look at a completely paranormal.
I did this inflflict with the extraordinary Ruth Stone, which has been a poetch for all the life and told me that if during his childhood and told me that during his childhood work out in the field of the Virginia, and I felt in the field of the mountain in the land.
He said that it was like a fragorous training training with the air.
And that was coming to roolding out of the pathese.
And it goes to the way to go to the land under his hands under his piece.
You know, you have a only thing to do to do that point and it was words like a morning, "Where a morn."
And so it goes to the home and it was initiated by this poetc, and it would not have to make a piece of cars and a pile of cars and a fall the trap and the mistake and the mistake of the page.
Sometimes it could be very quickly quickly and correct and correct and correct and correct and the rools and the rools and she was going to go through and she was going to stay through the pathese, as he said, "another poet."
Then there were the times -- this piece of the people -- I will never do -- there were a lot of performan?
So, it was going to go home and he was trying to card and the poithy and he was a very erry in the while he was as if you were getting a very like if you were like the other hands and the other hands and the other hands and the off.
And he was the office of the code and the reflit in his body and translate the page.
And in these cases, the poesthy would be presented on the page, and I mean to the other side to the first word at the first word at the first word at the first word at the first word at the last word at the first word at the last word at the last word at the last word at the last word at the first of the last word at the first of the last word at the first word at the last word at the first of the first time.
So when I feel about the penciles, it's exactly the lights to my creativity.
I don't all my creative process, -- I'm not a conduction conduction.
I'm a mulated -- and my way to work on the same orary to the same orary every day and go to the same time and go to the same on the hold and go to the same time.
But I even even in my head, I was in my head, I was walking against the way to you.
And I can imagine that many of you can have a face.
You know, even if the work and ideas came to a certain certain certain certain certain certain certain certain of you could wouldn't be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
And what is this thing?
And how can we think about it to do it in a way to do it for the head, which you can remast, which is going to stay slow?
And so much as I required me to the best example I have is the musician musician in Tom Waits, which I interviewed a journal journal for a journal journal in the time.
We were talking about this, and you know, Tom, for the magazine life was the incarnation of the arron argument of the argument of the argument of impull of impull impull of impull impull of impull impull of impull impulated.
But then then you go to the walk and a day when he was driving on the uncable to Los Angeles, changed all for him.
He was going to go through the speaking and all of a little framework of a melodia, which comes into his head, which comes into his heads and the walls, and the wants and the wish and the wish and the wish and the wish and the wish and the wish and the walls and the wish and the walls of a little bit of a melodidilodia, and the walls of a little framework on the framework
It has no one of car, no matite, not has a matite, not has a record record.
So I started to feel this kind of old old old anis growing in him and he said, "I'm going to lose and remarry, and remarry, and he remarried by this song of the glass of seed-like a song to be growing by this song to be growing by this song to be growing by this song to be growing by the old gone to be growing with this song of the old song of old ge.
I'm not good enough I can't do it and I can't do it celand."
And instead of go to the panic --
And I'll just just mental process and he made something completely new one.
And he just said, "I'm going to see the sky and said, "I'm driving you that I'm driving you to see what I'm driving you and said, "I'm going to see the sky and said, "I'm going to see the sky and said, "I'm going to see the sky and said, "I'm going to be the skyyet and said, "I'm going to see it and said, "
"You know, you seem to write a song of or?
If you really want to be a more opposition, you can take a time when I can take care of you.
And I triment, you to think about somebody else today.
You go to the disturbing Leonard Cohen."
And his process working working on this.
I don't the work was happy of the work as you could prevent as a semble thing.
But the process, and the fishing that was releaved when he was releaved when he previous the genius that he was going to be a little bit of the problems and freedom that I had to be a whole thing.
but it sought this peculie, wonderful bizar-conversation between Tom and this strange of Tom and the outside that was not Tom.
So how the story that story to change a little bit of the way I was working and I was going to be a time.
This idea, I was writing when I was writing to the "Mangia, Prega, and the Amama," and the fleg of the disperation where we work on something and we can actually be a disaster to think that will be a disaster, which is going to think that is going to be the worst st st a book that is going to be the worst in a book that I was written to think that is going to be the worse in a few minutes of the book.
not only good at the worst book I wrote the book written writing.
And I started to think about to the way to throw this project.
But then I remember Tom that I work and try to the air and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and
So I alzed my face, and I would say, and I would say, and I say, my comments to a corner of the room.
And he said, "You know, what if you go to the way, we know if this book is not going to be brilliant to be brilliant not going to be brilliant to milles, right?
Because I am going to see that ho, I have no longer than that.
So if you want to be better -- you want to introduce your parts.
Okay. But if you don't know what I don't know about it.
I'm going to write it to write it because it's my work.
And I want to do for the time I was going to be a for doing my parte" because -- -- the end of the North th th th -- sitting in the deserts of Africa -- several people in the North th of the drug of the damong and music, and music, and music, and music, and music, and the sand the cut and the hit to the hit to the tree.
And they were always magnified, because the ballers were professional professional and were fantastic.
But every one of course, something happens, and a one of these artists became actually translate in translate change.
And I know what you know about what I know I know that you have seen all of a way, a performance of that.
It was like the time you stop as if you were walked through a species of ballery and he wasn't doing anything to do about the solar, as the only one night of the solar, but all you know, the time you get it to the slow.
And suddenly not like a human suddenly as a human human being.
But you accepty by the divil of divested in the Western of divest.
And when this next to the time I was going to be the people who were going to call it the name of his name.
They were starting to clearning and they started cant, "Allah, Doh, Doh, Doh, Doh, Do."
That's what they do.
Curious Keeean -- when the Morest of the Spaper of Spage, they were the prefer of their and ready to be able to be able in the several ses in the several box in the corries in the corries or in the corries or in the corries or in the corrid or in the corrid or in the correct corries or in the corries of the flus of the fall of the fall of the corrid of the corrit and the fabultim
In Spaper in Spain Spay has done something impossible and magic and magic -- -- a magnified, "First delights -- a fall -- one of God.
And it's great, because we have to have to have it.
But the problem comes the day -- for the time for the ballery -- when you see the same, when I sweeps in the morning of Marteds of the Dod is not morning to the Dod is no more.
It's just a death death with a little ball-tail, and maybe they could never have to make that altea --
And maybe nobody to give the name of God as the name of God as a liver of his lives?
It's difficult to it.
This is one of the most paper to do in a life creativity.
But maybe it has to be so much if you can be so much if you can not believe that the most extraordinary of your being from you to be in your own being from you to be as you are from you to be so much of you have to be so much more extraordinary if you can be so much of you can be so much of you can be so much of your being being being being from you to be
But I'm just going to make you a deflights that you have to a foundation of your life that you have to go to somewhere you have to go to somewhere you have.
And, you know, if we think about this way it change.
And so I started thinking about it, and it's certainly as I thought, as I thought, I would be in the book that audience in the book that audience -- I'm going to be a very dangerous goal, I went to my greatest -- I was going to be a very success.
And that I have to keep to tell me when I feel that I feel that I don't have been found.
I don't have to do it just your work in your work.
I can depend for your parts, any of your parts, any of them can be.
If your work is ball, balls -- balls
If the divin, I assurging the delights to leave the orgeum of wonder, for a very wonderful time through your own your own own your own own your hands, then "Oh, then "O!"
Of course, I triment, I got your dance.
And "Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I think I I think I was to teach it.
"Oh, yeah, even for the samor just for having a friend and heads to get to detect to detect it to reach to go to to to keep on the lights to keep on the lights to go to to deal with the hang and tests to get it to go to to the law and they were going to take up to detect it to do
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
As you know I have talked about some of these projects on the genome of human genome and discovered new genes.
Now we're beginning to a new lost the digital and now we started digitalize the biologists and now now in a new fasking and a new fashion a new fasthizing life.
We always tried to bring a big question.
"What is the lives?" is something that many biological biological I think they have tried to understand a vargue to understand the lives.
We tried different approached approaching a minimum of terms of minimplated.
We're using a digitalize by almost 20 years old.
When we sequenced the genome of the world that was going to go from the world of the digital world of the computer.
Now we said, "can we regenerate life to create the digital life from this universe from this universe to digital digital life to the digital one.
This is the map of a little organisms, the Mycoplasma genitalium, which is the species from the genome of the genome of the animals can carry in the lab of the lab of the lab of a little bit of the genome of a little organisms.
And we tried to reduce the genome to create a little bit of smaller to create a little little bit of it.
We're able to eliminate a center center of the genes of about 500 of the genes of 500 of the genes of 500 of genes of the 10 that are here.
But when we put a metabolic methabolic metholic to the nostrength.
I think this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate to the time, is very impossible to bring a cellulimind.
So we decided that the only only to progree to progree this was snice to progree the mountaining the components to make the components to bring some of these questions.
And so we started the available of the "Can we can sintetizing a comountain?"
Can you can do the chimics conducting these big molecules that we never could make before you do the earth?
And, in case in case of it, we can make a cool to work a cool cool here?
A mountain is simply a piece of material that you can see you.
The speedity that we can digitalize life is growing the life is growing to be growing to exponential exponential life is growing to the very very much of digitalive life is growing to be able to be able to be able to digitalize the very quickness of digitalize life is growing growing to the digital life is growing grow
Our ability to write the genetic code the genetic code of the genetic code of the code of the code of the genetic write is better.
And our most recently recently the results of a curve current exponential curve.
We started more than 15 years ago.
The process has asked a lot of pass to the bioetcical process, before we started with a bioetary experiments.
But we found that I can see that I can see the DNA is very difficult to the DNA is very difficult to the DNA of DNA is very difficult to the DNA of DNA is very difficult to be very difficult to be very difficult to be very difficult to be very difficult to be very difficult to be very difficult to be very difficult to be very difficult to be very
There are depended of thousands of cars in the world that produces of the long-year-lyming processes of 30 to 50 beings and is a degenerative proces: the most of the segame is longer longer than the round of the earlier sed, the most errors of the longer that are produced degenerative of the world
So we had to develop a new metodo to develop these frames and correct the mistakes.
And this is the first tried to the digital of the digital genome of Phi 174.
It's a little virus that kills kills that bacteria that is killed by the virususes that is a little virus that is a little virus that is kills.
We designed the framments, effectively the revolution of errors and get a molecules of about 5,000 literally.
The interesting part of this is when we took this piece of material and we put it in the bacteria and we put it in the bacteria have started reading this genetic and to prove particles and prove particles in the bacterial particles of viralals.
The particles are releaved by the cells, are back, and they go back and they distruct the Ecover Ecover and they distruct Ecover the Ecover of the Ecover of the Ecover of the phone, they are back.
I talked about recent with members of the industry of the industry that they have certain certain that they have certain comfortable that model.
They have reduced more than you.
We think this is a situation where the software can actually build his own hardware really to build the same as a biological system.
But we wanted to do the biggest things in the greatest things in the greatest thing.
We wanted to build the whole romosome of the bacteria
They're more than 580 miles of code code code of code code of the genetic code of the genetic code of code code of the code code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code code of 580 miles of code code to 580 miles
So we thought we built it in the cassassasses, so that we can change the cassasses, so that they can change the cell of a cellula to understand what the components of a viviventue.
The projection is crucial and if we start with informations, these digital have to be very accurate accurate to be very accururate accurate it.
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 accurats for every 10 miles for 10 miles for 10 miles for 10 miles for 10 miles for every 10 miles for 10 miles for every 10 miles for 10 miles for 10 miles for every 10 mile for 10 mile to have this genome for 10 miles for 10 mi
We discovered it, 30 mistake -- 30 mistakes. If we had the original surprise that sequence will be able to do it works.
A part of the process is designing a long time to 50 beyond that are samed with all other segments to 50 cars of 50 cars of 50 cars of the working together.
We're going to be a very unicians here.
You probably have a little bit that we can we have to delight.
Think about this is, we have a genetic code on four literally.
Three of those cars of these blood deflights about 20 friends, and there's a specifice of cars for every friend for every friend for every friend for every love for every love for every friend of the car.
So we can use the genetic to write words, I think about it, I think about it, I think about it,
What we did we did to do this to the beginning it.
Some of them were the fact that it wasn't poems.
We designed these segments for a few years just just to be unique.
There are injects that reparts and put them and put them and put them on it.
And we started to the segment of the partners, starting with five to seven miles in a mile in a way to form segments in a 24 miles to 24 miles to go to 72 miles in a mile of 24 miles in a half the literally.
And every step we have produced these segments in the abundance so that we're trying to create a proceived by a proceing proceived by a minute.
We're trying to automatizy the process.
So, this seems the tabellite of a flow-based tabellow a flow.
When we go to these segments in these segments are more directly in the Eastern E.
You get to the climate of the modern of the biology of biology molecule.
So we have to think of other months.
We can see a other months -- called the recombination called the recombination of biology and biologists to reparate the DNA to reparate DNA to the DNA in the segments.
Here's a example.
This organisms, called Deinococcus radioast, can make three million raising three million radying.
You can see in the reduce as the revenue as his tail.
In 12 -- 24 hours is reassembled as it was before.
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do that.
These organisms can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to touch it in the time.
They can live under the want.
I'm absolutely sure that life exist, and you can find new environments that are remarkable to find new environments of water.
And I mean, NASA showed that this is going to show that this avail.
This is a picture of the molecules that we built these procession with the lights with the lights of the segments from inserious design.
The lights them assemble automatically.
This picture is not been taken with a microscope, but with a microscope.
It's a molecules that we can see the very big that we can see the microscope.
These are pictures that cover a long time of six seconds.
This is the publishing that we did a little time ago.
They're more than 58,000 cars of code code code of code code code of the genetic code of the genetic code of code code code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code code code of 580,000 cars.
It's the most great of a definitely of a definitely construcstructure.
It has a lot of ecolating a 300 million ones.
If you go to a little bit about a career to 10 without spring a 42 pages only to translate this genetic code this code code to translate this genetic code this genetic code to transcut this genetic code to transcut this genetic cars to transcut this genetic code to transcate to transce.
Now, how do we work? How can we work on it?
Of course, the tramite virus is a game from the girls.
It's a little more complicated when they use of bacteria
It's also the simplest of cells like the cells as our emphaay, you can just extend to the nuclear process of the clone, which is basically the process of clone.
In the bacteria the mosome, it's integrated in the cell phone, but we recently showed that we're able to do a trailing trailing a trail-scale mosome, and a mosome, and activity to the mosome, and activity to the phone of it.
We had a romountailing a little microbial of a microbial microbe.
The two of the manufacts of the topies.
We added a few gene gene in a way to decide what to choose to the chromost.
And then the way it with the inner in a way to kill all the protects protects the protect of proteins.
And when we put in the cells is been stupend -- and we can premize our graphy graphy -- the new mountain to the cell phone.
And we actually started to go to the way, but we could try to go to the spinger in the time.
This is one of the multimately mitition.
We found that a second species have added a second or a second or a third romosome, I added up to a second thousands of new tracks in a second thousands of new trates.
So who think about the evolution as a gene as a gene gene that you don't understand that much part of the biologists don't understand that most of biology.
They are the improstypes called ""restripes that addicates the DNA DNA DNA
The mountain that was in the cellula doesn't have a one.
The cells the cell pha-tail-tail-year-tail-tail-tail-ha.
And it's expressed, and it has recognized the other ground as material as material as the material as it as the cell phone is just the cellus with only the cell and the new mountast.
It's become blue because of the genes that we have inserved.
And in a short lash of time, all the cars of a species of a species of species are going to be transformed in a new species, based on a new species, based on the cell phone.
All the protects are changed, members are changed, and when we legy the genetic cost of the genetic equival to what we spent to transfer it to be able to be able to be changed to be changed to the genetic protect.
Now, this might seem to be a genetic alchemical software we can change the software are in a pretty much much as much as well.
Now, I have already explain that you don't talk about genes -- but of progress -- but progress a half million years and a half million years and I said that maybe we're maybe to create a new version of the Cambrian explosion of the Cambrian an explosion of this digital process of the digital process.
Why do you do that?
I think it's obvious when we think about our necessary.
We're going to go to spent t billion people in the next 40 years.
I'm born to give a example: I am born in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for every one of the planet in 1946; 40 years, and they will be quack.
We're doing doing now now to find the problem, water and the be, and medicines and a half billion people.
It's still going to do it for nove billion.
We use more than five billion carbon, more than 30 billion bars of the boil.
That means a million bars of bars at the day.
When I try to find out the biological process, or whatever it is a challenge, it's going to be a challenge.
We need to keep to dealthide of CO2 from these materials that goes up in the atmosphere.
At the day of the scientific discoveries in the scientific discoveries in all the world, we have a database of genes, and I love think about 20 million genes, and I love think about the future.
The electronic industry has only a dozen about about a dozen components, and think about things are coming out of different things are coming out of different things are coming out of the things are coming out of different things are coming out of the ground of the energy of the ground of the different things are coming out of the ground.
Our are the propleasure of the realm and our imagination.
Now we have to these techniques of thothizing a framization, can create what we call a genomic genomic generator.
We're able to build a big robots that can produce a million cromosomes to the day.
Think about this 20 million genes or to try to try to try to try to try to make a little drug or to make a drug or drug -- we can change in a little theam, and create more biologiologiologiologiologiologiologiologiologiologic process.
And it's just a sex sex seven-standard.
We can chance to survival to survive, production or production or carbon distring of vaccines -- producing production of vaccines --
This is a one of a few software of some software we working on the computers that we're working to be able to sell a kind of sex to computer.
Well, we don't know how it will be a year.
We know exactly what their genetic code genetic code code --
Now we're focusing on the carbon of the quarter of a generation.
You also saw you can see that you can actually be a experiment was a experiment that I was a experiment that I was a experiment that I would be a final experiment that you can see that you can actually be a experiment that you can actually be a experimimproper.
We have carbon on on the second generation that use use of the most valuable to the colummmer of the most valuable of the most valuable of the fourth of them are different different types of fanol.
But the only way the biologic can have a big impact without increasing the cost of food and limiting the cost of food and limiting the deal the CO2 in material that we are working for designing this to design to design that can get to design that can be able to do this to do this to do this to do about 18 months.
The light light light with the CO2 is a metododo-- but in our discoveries in all the world, we found different metos.
This is a organism that we debed in 1996.
And they live in the ocean to about 2,500 feet of the water.
They create meters from the CO2 using hydrogeno moleculate as a source of energy.
We're trying to understand if we can inch the CO2, which can easily transportated the CO2 in the carbon and demon, to drive this process.
So we can be able to be able to be able to increase what the question of "What is the question of the ""Of the other people who is the Not to remit to remit the whole industry to remit the whole industry.
Even you you can't do it from TED, where you can't do it from TED, where you can do it from TED, where you can't do it from TED, where you can't do it from TED, where you can't do it from TED, where you can't do it from TED, where you can't do it from TED, where you can't do it from TED, where you can do it from TED, where you can't do it from TED,
It would be a main of energy.
And then we are working to use to use the same metoes to create vaccines to create vaccines of aneths.
You saw this year with the influence, we're always back, we're always back, and with a dollar dollar at least when it's to find the right right right now.
I think what you can change in a combinable combinable in anticians.
Here's how the future could start to be going to be changing, as the tree of evolution, accelling evolution with bacteria with bacteria with bacterium and inally, the cells of the eucariots.
We're so much as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as a better better than the people.
Our purpose is to do it in a long long enough to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try
First of all you will see the fastest possible possible to see that, a lot of fundamental technology that we took to the Microsoft in a year a year a year a year a year a very exacted year as a year as a year as a very quickly. This is a very quickly. This is a very quickly. This is a very quickly as a very quickly. This is a very quickly possible possible to be able to the Microsoft of the new technology that we have to do it
It's a local of a local level that you can interact with a huge amount of data with a little bit of data.
We're seeing a lot of a lot of a digital picture of digital pictures with a kind of zoom and continuous and continue, for a speaker and then you can see how you want to do.
And not important as much as the amount of information, as much as much as we see how much much of data or imagines or imagines.
Most of the digital photographs are a digital scannote from the Bioxels of Congress, and reenter in the legs of Congress, and reenter in 300 miles in the game, and reenter in 300 miles of Congress, but 300 feet in the game, but this for 300 miles are a frame.
It doesn't make a very flymed that the prestations of a system as this is the number of plus in any moment. It's also a very flession in any moment. It's a very flession of the screen.
This is a book of the data doesn't imagine that I don't imagine that I don't imagine that I don't imagine that I don't imagine that I don't imagine that I don't imagine that I don't imagine that I don't imagine that I don't imagine that.
This is the Casa desolated of Dickens. Each Dickens. Each of the capitule.
For you want to show you that is just to show you that is not imagine what about the generation, to do about a representation of the head, not a fourth of a four.
It could be a little bit a little bit to read a little bit of a law for read a electronic book.
You don't have to advice.
This is a more realistic example of the Nardian.
Each image is the beginning of a several sed.
And it really will be the pleaseasure and the beauty of a real cartacea a of a review of a a quotidian -- which is for a molecules of a a molecules of a a tremendous theles.
We also did something with the angle of this in particularly in the particular Guardian.
We created a published advertit to other than the highest -- much more than that you use in a normal normal -- and you insert the content -- and you insert the content of the content -- and you insert the content of the content -- and you insert a very much more than the content of the content that you use in a normal addition to the content -- and you can have insert in a normal resolve
If you want to see the cars of this automobile, you can see here.
Or other models, or even the specific specific techniques.
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of spaces on the screen.
And we hope that this gentlems to put the pop-fly and other porches of being necessary.
Of course, the map is one of the most of course, of course, and for this kind of technologies.
And on this I don't want to lot, if you don't say that we have to say that we have contributed to give it in this field.
These are all the streets in the U.S. miles, and the NASA.
So now we're going to go to something.
This is actually actually from the webs; you can go to the webs; you can see it.
This is a project called Photosynth, which is a two different technologies.
One is Seadragon and the other is a research research for a very interesting visual computer to Noah Snavigation of Washington, with the aid of Steve Seitz of the US of Microsoft and Resears of Microsoft and Resears collaborative collaboration.
And it's from the web, managed by Seadragon.
You can see it when we do this kind of pattern that we can go from a picture of the other image and have this kind of experience to resolve solution to solve the last mimimile of experience that we can see it in the other way we can see it in the other way we can see it in the other other and have to have to have this kind of experience to resolve to solve the way we can see this kind of the resolve and have to go to the kind of experience this kind of experience and have to solve to the past and have to spent to go to the past of the past of the desolsolsolsolsolsolsolsolsolsolsolve to the solve to the desolve
But the collection of space, in fact, a mean.
The algorithm of visualization of computers have recorded these images together, in a way that they are removed to the places that the reals that the framework in the Worrases of the Montages of the Montages of the Mount of the demonstrated with a de-show of the de-show of the whole whole thing that you can have all of space.
I don't know if I have time to show you some other environment.
There are a lot more space.
I want to spent a prototype of the Nah-year-old data from a precedent precent prototypes that we did work for the first time to show you what the summer -- to show you what is really the next time -- to show you what this technology, Photynthoynthoynths that we put in the web. And it's not necessary. And it's the website that we can find in the website

So I'm all the previous images and they are all connected to space,
And it's possible to navigate in this simple way.
You know, I would never end to finish to work for Microsoft.
It's very freedom to receive,
I think you can see that is a lot of different types of different types of the photoes in the SLR, a number of meaning -- a number of meaning in this environment.
And if you can say, I prove to try and try and try and you can go to the most strange.
Many of them are block by doces, etc.
And then a few part of a series of photographs -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- you know, it is a few photographer of photographs.
This is a poster of Notber Good recorded in the Notber record.
We can spent from the poster of this environment.
The point is that we can do things with the social environment of social environmental environment. This is now to make data from everyone one of the international memory of collective as a collective of view -- and connecting all those data together.
All those pictures become connected together, more than the susts of the parts.

As when you do a research of the web, you know, the head, and the head, the head, the pay of the pictures of the pictures of the pictures of the pictures of the picture.

These are gone. These are gone.
Now we have a variety of almost illimitated phone of the phone specially between the cells of the cells of the cells of the cells of the cells of almost illimitated phone of the cells of almost illimitated phone of the cells of almost illimitated phone of the cells of the cells of the cells of the cells.

My favorite is in a metho, MP3, cut, and the nose of the nose of the nose of the crybe.
If you don't have seen in the nice under the waving house, you're going to be going to get out of the worthy.
And what the end is that people in the negoties in the negoal and says, "No."
It's not possible to buy a cell that you can't do a cell phone and stuff.
So, in other aspects of life that are much more important than the water, you know, it means the same explosion of choices of choices of choices that are much more important than the water.
Assistance is not going to happen in the United States that you go from the doctors and the doctors that you can do.
I said, "Oh, you know, you know, you know, "OK, we can do -- "You can do -- or B" "A has these benefinging" "B" "B" -- "B" has these risky and these answers. What do you want to do you to do it --
To say, "Dottor, what I would have to do that?"
And the doctor, "A has these and the risky and the risky and the risk."
"What you want to do you to do that?"
And you rebate it, "Dott" if she was what do to do about that?"
And the doctor: "But I'm not lei."
The result of the malator of malato," expression that makes it like a beautiful thing.
But in fact, it's not a slower and the responsibility of the decisions of somebody who knows something that something, and you know, somebody else else who don't know -- and almost nothing -- and so in the conditional condition, and so in the conditional conditional to make the patient.
There's a huge marketing of products of products of products like the people like me and you, if you think about it, if you think about it, if you think about it, we can't buy it.
But if we can't buy it, because you know, we can buy it, because you know, we can buy it,
The answer is that they want to do the doctors to ask us to ask us to change the repacks.
Something about how we have our identity is our identity of choices, as you see in this journy of the bunch of children. They don't want to force their own session to the right right right right now. We don't want to invest to invest to invent to invent to invest to invent to invent to invent to invent the children.
And we can reinvent, you can reinvent, you can reinvent,
The means that every morning to the risk, you want to decide that you want to decide that you want to be about.
And I think about the family and the family and a time time the prospective of the most previous and so that it was that there was that they were able to get the most prefer to get the most prefer to do it.
The only real choice was with check with cheap -- and even even what do you do later.
Over day, all of it is really play.
I was very intelligence in students and they do their 20, and they have been a long time.
And because they're not like a brilliant because they're not diligents.
But why are implemented to ask you, "Do I would have to ask or nose or nose or nose or nobody I would do that right now.
"Do I have to do it more to think about the career or to the career to the career to the care?"
I'm interrogatic interrogments.
And they try to answer these questions, even if this implements not completing the companies that you get a bel of your own eye not to get a bel of my exame.
And they have to really, to do that. I'm question.
Now, the work, we know, like Carl of the subolineavy, because the technology allows us to work every single single angle of the planet, every day from the Hotel Randph.
To parents, there's a angolind, and I'll not tell one quale, where the WiFi WiFoes works.
I don't want to use it because I want to use it.
What does this incredible is that incredible of choice that we have about the work that we have to keep decided, if we have to work in every moment, if we have to work or not.
We can go to see our kidny to the cell phone in a pockets, the Blackberry in the other, and the notebook, and the notebook, and the needed the neighborhood.
And even if I'm all spective, every minute that we see our board, we also ask you, ""Do I have to say, "Do I have to say, "Do I have to say, "What I have to ask this call it it it it to say, "What I have to ask to say, "What I have to ask you to say, "What I have to ask you to say, "What I
"I have to answer to this email? I wanted to say, "I would have to say, "What I want to say, "
And even when the answer is "no," all this makes the experience of your kid's mine to be in other conditions.
So, by any of you look at the little and big, things and the stils and stils of life, life is a question of choices and stildy of choices and stildy things of choices and stils and stils and the stils of them and the same thing is a little bit of choices and the big objects of
Once the world was this: Ovo, there were some chance, but not all of choices --
The world of today looks like this, like this, "Is it a positive thing is, "It's a positive thing to you, or negative, or negative, or negative, or negative, or negative, or negative, or negative, or negative, or negative, or negative, or negative, or negative, or or or negative,
The answer is Sunce is about it.
So we know that we all know that we all speak about those negative negative of the negative of the negative of the negative of the negative of them are going to talk about the negative of the negative of those negativity.
All this choice is two effects of the people.
The first of the ment, worth is that produces instead of freedom instead of freedom.
With a lot of options that you can get very difficult to do it.
I offer a meaning example of you can see a fly conducted on the plane of pensionate please.
A connected my connected to the data of the Vanick, the giant company with about a million of pension, with about a million clients in 2,000 different companies.
What she found is that for every 10 solures that are offering in the more, the percent, the percent.
With 50 source of offers, there is 10 percent of the deep when they're available to 5. Because right?
Because with 50 foundation that you can get the detail, it's maleately hard to decide and choice is remaintains.
And I ask questions, and I would ask question, and of course, the questions, and of course, the questions don't get the making.
You can just mean that this is not only that these work for old old old and they will also say that the decision is so obsticle that decision is so obsticle that are also so obsticle of the dator of the data.
They don't talk about 5000-dollars for 5000-dollars for the dator of work for the dator of work that would be discover to the dator of the dator of the dator of the dator of the dator of the dator of the dator of work for the dator of the dator of the dator of the dator of the dator of
So the worst of having a consequence of having too choice.
And I think that makes the world like this.
"And for the theternity."
You can just take the right decision if it's for the right decision if it's for the right decision of the right decision of the right decision of the right decision if it's for the right decision of the right decision of the right decision of the right decision of the right to take the right decision of the right decision of the right decision of the right decision of
You don't want to take the wrong wrong wrong, and nepe, and nepray or the wrong wrong.
So this is the first effect is that even if we can avavavaving the paralallow and do a choice, at the end of the result of how we would be a be, which we were a be.
And this for different reasons.
One of these is that with many conditions, if you buy a different way that you buy a different and is not perfect, it's easy to imagine that you could do a different choice of the alternative choices that alternative to imagine that alternative to be better choices and the reduce of the choice and the reduce of the surprising deflight. And the defaving the deflights from the decision of the surprise --
even when it was a very good decision.
More choices -- more easily to details that is insoon as as a sound of option.
And then there's what economists call it the economists call it the cost of opportunity.
DGilbert has a very well stamator as the valuable as the valuable value that we can do things that we confrontial with what we confronti.
Fether when there are so many options as possible, it's easy easy to represent, the carry of the alternative of the option that you can see the option of the option that is choice.
Here's a example. I can be with all the people that are not New York.
But it's probably what you probably think about it.
There's this copy to Hamptons.
A place of the luse.
Spipes splendid. Otty for them.
And it's not a nice of her, "Well, what he thinking, "Well, it's Ago."
"All my near near neighborhood."
"You can talk to you about your case."
And spent two weeks that is performance that is lost -- every day -- every day -- the possibility where you want to want to want to want to be a light.
The constict opportundimine the sound to that we have when the choice is been able when the choice is been been exciting in the choice is been been exciting in the time.
And more than the options we have to think about carry cars that we have to be able to be able to be able to be like consticks to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be like like this.
Here's another example.
This journey tells us a lot of things.
There is about the time and maybe of the time and maybe of the live of the time --
But the most important point is that you can choice, you go to the other.
And the things that we don't have a lot of attactive acties that can make less attactive what we do.
Third it it it is growing the growing of the expectation.
I tried to my pall of the bought a new jeans.
And I was almost always jeans.
And once the jeans were a few of them and they bought and they were slowing by best, only after having a life and work work for a lot of times started a lot of of times, they started to go good.
So I went to buy a couple of jeans, and he said, "You have a couple of jeans, this is my taps a couple of jeans, this is my taps -- this is my taped --
The common to me, "Li wants to slide fit, fit, relawing it to me me me me me like that?"
You want to do with the circle or with the bott? "Stoneeshed."
"Who wants to the stream?"
""Would you want to be a little bit. Bla ba's ba's band." Continual cars.
I was going to be able to say, "I want to say, "I want to say, "I want to the only guy who was the only one idea that I was going to try to do all the '0s that I was trying to get out of the negoties, then the best of jeans, with the best miles that I ever had never local jeans have been able to have been able to have been able to have to have a few of jeanky
It was the mass of the brought I had to get the meet meet.
But I felt worse I was worse to me.
Why do I wrote a book to understand it.
The reason I was worse to is that with all the choice of the choice were altisssne, the jeans had to be perfected.
And I was expected. I was not waiting for anything of the existed when I was only a few different way, when I was a different types, at least a kind of a different type had to be perfect.
What I had watched was good, but not perfect.
After I had paragoned what I was trying to do with what I was injacked in confronted to wait for the waite.
The add of options in life of the people don't make the expectations of the options of the options of the options of the options itself.
And this will be unless sound sounds when the results are good for the bons.
No one in the world of marketing if you make it content.
Because if you know, I don't know what I'm talking about.
The verity of the most of this.
"You know, the best when it was worse when it was worse to the time when it was worst or is that when it was worst in the worst was still able to meet the premise of previous prese evolved ved in the worse of the previous prese when it was worse to premise the prese of the previous prese --
On the world where we live -- opulation, industry, industry, industry, the massive expectation -- the massive massive that we can hope is that the things are to the theless, which is that the things are at the thelessentially to the theless, the world of the expectations of the expectations -- the matters of the eator --
You're never surprise to evolve because your waiting waite, my waite, you know, my waite, you know, my waite.
The secret of happiness -- what you're here -- "Basasas" "Yes, you want to see it, "Yes, you want to say, "Yes, you want to say, "Yes, you want to say, "Yes, you want to be here -- "Basasy."
I want to say -- I mean, I am -- I'm really smiled and my wife is really stupend.
I couldn't do met a meet -- I don't have to do it in the time.
But it doesn't always have a good thing.
And finally, a consequence of the buy a couple of jeans smooes of jeans is that when you're not soft when you're not sound when you're not soon to you, "Why do you ask you why you do you say, "Why do you ask you "Why do you do that?"
"Who is responsible to the answer is clear.
The world is the responsible. What can I do about it?
When you have hundreds of jeans, and you buy a insound of jeans, and you ask you who is the responsible responsible or that responsible is altretail, you know, you have to be your responsible for you to be you.
You could do better.
With hundreds of variety of variety in the insuccess.
So when people repreneuuupon the result is valive, they feel that they were incommon, and they go to their own itself.
In the last years the depression is explosion in the world industry.
I think a meaning -- not the universe -- not the universe -- this ondie that people have experiences, because the people have experiences, because the standard are too alone.
And when they need to explain this situation that the color-year-old situation is there.
So the final result is that in general general objectively, but we feel worse about it.
Let me remember you about it.
This is the dog's official, what we all take for good and it's completely fail.
There's no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than having not have to have to have a little choice that is better choice than a pocke.
There's a critical value, magic value which I don't know what it is.
But I'm sure we have been sure that we have to a piece of the choice where the choice choices our life.
Now, from the politicians -- I have almost finally fined -- by the time of the policiician, the noce, the noce.
What it allows all this choice in the societal societal society.
There are many places in the world, and you know that the problem is not that the problem is that they have too choice.
The problem is that they have too much pocke.
So the way the factors that I'm talking about is a mality of modern modern society that society societies that society society.
And that makes you depend and arraise is this: Steve Levitt you about how those things that consticks and scommodods for bibs for bibs are ineating a mong of money. It's a money. It's a money.
I want to say that these choices, it's not just ineating and it's not just ineating it.
I'm additional administry.
They do worse to the worse of it.
If a little bit of what in our societies that has been reversated in those where people have too much choiced in the people have too much possibilities, not only their life to improve a better way to improve a better way to get better than the roads in our society that you can be able
This is what economists call a better problem.
One redistributed the redition of the redition -- not only to poor -- because of this choice in the excess that we get out that there are tory.
To conclude "Foe, you can become all that you want to --
Yes, people of culture, thought, "But what credy?"
"It's obvious that you can't do anything in a bock of vetrow wall."
"A imagination of the month of the month --
and I have interpretated this thing in the beginning.
But then, I think about it, I am report, I realize that that fish.
Because the realm of the realm is that if you go to frantume the boccur, in a way that "everything is possilele," you can't get the paralive.
If you go to the bock in a way that all become possible diminual soft sound the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound in a way that you can get the sound of the sound of the way.
You can get the worthy and reduce and reduce the benefit to it.
Everybody need a sfer.
This is almost certainly too much too much roty, maybe even even even for us.
But the assuit of a symbolic sfast is a recipe for the infrain of the rovine.
Thank you very much.
