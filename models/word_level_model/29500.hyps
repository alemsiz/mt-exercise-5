I showed these <unk> <unk> <unk>, which for almost three million years has had the size of the United States <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, has <unk> 40 percent <unk>.
<unk> this <unk> the <unk> of the problem because it doesn't show the ice <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> is, in a way, the heart <unk> of the global climate system.
They <unk> <unk> and <unk> in the summer.
The next <unk> will be a <unk> <unk> for the last 25 years.
<unk> <unk> are <unk> in red.
You can see, it <unk> up to the blue <unk>.
That's the ice in <unk>, that <unk> summer.
You can see that the <unk> ice <unk>, of five years or more, it's like the blood here <unk> from the body.
In 25 years it's been <unk> like this.
This is a problem because the <unk> is <unk> the <unk> <unk> around the ocean, where there are huge <unk> of <unk> that, <unk>, <unk>, are <unk> in <unk> from the <unk>.
We're going to <unk> to global <unk>, that <unk> could <unk>, that amount of <unk>, that <unk> could <unk>, right now.
In some <unk> <unk>, the <unk> is already <unk> from the water.
The <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> has <unk> with a team <unk> a <unk> <unk> last <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>! <unk>: <unk>: <unk>. The question is if you <unk> it.
A reason is that this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from the north.
This is a river in <unk>.
It has never <unk> <unk> levels.
This is the <unk> river, in the <unk> of <unk>.
If you want to know how the <unk> is <unk> for the sea level <unk>, for the <unk> of the <unk>, here is where the sea.
These <unk> are <unk>.
On the other side of the planet: <unk>, the largest <unk> of ice on the planet.
<unk> month, <unk> scientists have <unk> that the <unk> of the ice is in <unk>, and that <unk> on some <unk> <unk>, is particularly <unk> in <unk>.
<unk> at <unk> feet of the <unk>, like in <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, the third largest <unk> of ice, you see new <unk>, which a few years ago, which is <unk>.
<unk> percent of the world's population <unk> water from that <unk>.
<unk> <unk>: this <unk> is the source of <unk> water in this city.
The <unk> is <unk>.
But when you <unk>, the same happens to the water.
It's <unk> on <unk> <unk> 40 percent.
<unk> <unk> are in the crisis.
<unk>, as you read, they're <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> in the world brings a <unk> increase in <unk>.
<unk> <unk> are <unk> to a <unk> out of the normal and without <unk>.
<unk> times over the last 30 years, <unk> to the <unk> <unk>.
This is a <unk> of the whole <unk>.
If you look in the <unk> context, you can see the <unk>.
We've been <unk> in the last five years, <unk> 70 million <unk> -- 25 million <unk> in the oceans every day.
Look at the area of the <unk> <unk>, from <unk>, to <unk>, and both of the <unk> of the <unk>, where there is a <unk> <unk> of oxygen in the oceans.
The largest cause of global warming, together to <unk>, which is the use of <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> is a problem, and <unk> is even worse.
The United States is one of the two countries with <unk> <unk>, together to China.
And they <unk> to build a lot of other <unk> <unk>.
But we're <unk> a <unk> of direction.
These are the <unk> projects over the last few years and some <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
And so there's a political <unk> in our country.
<unk> <unk> and oil <unk> have <unk> million dollars in the last year to <unk> <unk> <unk>, which is a <unk>.
<unk> image, I'm going to give you something --
<unk> <unk>, in <unk>, where I live, there was a <unk> of <unk> billion <unk> of <unk>.
Maybe you've seen it on the <unk>.
This is the second largest flow of <unk> in America.
It's happened around <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> of one of the <unk> <unk> was this.
<unk>: <unk>, <unk> the <unk> is a <unk> and happy.
It's <unk> here in America, and it makes our economy.
<unk> the <unk> is <unk> and more <unk>.
It's in good price, <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
Al <unk>: <unk> is a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The largest society <unk> on the <unk> is <unk> <unk>. This is his <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> <unk>: <unk> clear -- Al <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> -- they don't know what they're talking about.
Al <unk>: So the <unk> for the <unk> of <unk> has <unk> two <unk>.
This is one of them, one.
<unk>: <unk>: <unk> we see the <unk> changes as a <unk> <unk> to our business.
So, in our <unk> is <unk> a big amount of money in a <unk> to public and <unk> the truth in <unk>.
Actually, <unk> is not <unk>.
We think of <unk> -- it's also a good <unk>.
So we don't know about climate change.
We could do it.
<unk>: <unk> <unk> -- you've heard about it a lot of it.
So we <unk> a <unk> <unk> structure for <unk> as <unk>.
<unk>! <unk> are a little <unk>, but this is the sound of the technology of <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> is between the major <unk> of global warming, but the <unk> technology <unk> that you see changes everything.
Let's look at this: this is the <unk> <unk> technology.
Al <unk>: <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk> to the economic security.
<unk>: <unk>: America is in crisis; the <unk>, national security, the <unk> crisis.
The <unk> that <unk> all: our <unk> <unk> from the <unk> <unk>, like <unk> and the <unk> oil.
Now, there's a new, <unk> solution to <unk> it.
<unk> America: 100 percent of <unk> energy in 10 years.
A plan to <unk> America at work, <unk> more <unk>, and help help <unk> global warming.
<unk>, a solution that we're going to solve our problems.
<unk> America. <unk> more.
Al <unk>: This is the last one.
<unk>: <unk>: It's about <unk> energy to America.
One of the <unk> ways of <unk> <unk> to <unk> from the <unk> that <unk> our planet.
<unk>: The future is here. <unk>, sun, a new network.
<unk> <unk> 2: <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> America. It's time to be <unk>.
Al <unk>: A old <unk> <unk> says, "If you want to go <unk>, go alone.
If you want to go far, you go. "
We have to go far, quickly.
Thank you very much.
I did a <unk> on <unk>.
And we try to <unk> about how the car works.
So here we go. And for those who the other time't there were the largest scientific experiment that's ever been <unk> -- <unk> miles of <unk>.
<unk> is to <unk> the conditions that were in less than a <unk> of a second from the beginning of the universe -- until <unk> million times a second.
All of this is just <unk>.
This is the <unk> <unk>.
They <unk> these <unk> <unk> inside the <unk>.
This is what I'm working on. It's called <unk> feet and it has a <unk> <unk>.
This is a <unk> picture of <unk> in <unk> in this construction, and you can see the <unk>.
<unk> <unk> last year we <unk> the car for the first time.
And this picture was <unk> by <unk>.
It was <unk> of <unk> <unk> in the control.
It's an image of the first <unk> of particles that he had done all the <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, with a part of the <unk>, and <unk> particles inside the <unk>.
In other words, when you <unk> that picture the 10 <unk>, I <unk> that the machine <unk>, which is a great <unk>.
I don't know if that was to make us more or this <unk>, when someone <unk> on Google and I knew that the <unk> page was this.
That means we have a <unk> impact on the scientific impact.
And I was a week later, there was a problem with the car, to just these <unk> here -- these <unk> <unk>.
These <unk> <unk> <unk> when the car works in the <unk> of <unk>.
Now, the <unk> of you will <unk> the <unk> and <unk>, "It's not true. I'm too <unk>."
And instead they can do that because when they are very <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
So <unk> degrees, at least <unk> degrees, at the <unk> temperature to the stars, these <unk> can bring that <unk>.
In one of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, there was a <unk> of <unk>.
So the <unk> <unk> <unk>, and the <unk> <unk> <unk> a electric <unk>.
This was the result.
Now, this is even more <unk> if you think that these <unk> <unk> more than 20 <unk>, and that have been <unk> about 30 <unk>.
They <unk> about 50 <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, what we did.
We <unk> them and <unk>.
They're now <unk> all their <unk> place.
<unk> the end of <unk> the <unk> will be again.
We <unk> it, and we try to get some data to <unk> or <unk>, and continue so our <unk> to find out what the universe is that <unk> that <unk> the universe.
Now, of course, in a way, these <unk> <unk> the <unk> on the value of science and engineering engineering to <unk>. It's easy to <unk>.
I think the fact that is so hard, the fact to go beyond the <unk>, I think it's the value of things like <unk>.
I want to end with the words of a <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, who, <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of his <unk> experiments, his <unk> was Michael <unk>, said, "No, <unk> so <unk> for the progress of human mind, is so <unk> that the ideas of science are <unk>, that there are no <unk> in nature, that there are no new <unk> from nature, that there are no new <unk> from the <unk>.
Thank you.
I want to start <unk> when, as children, <unk> with <unk>.
And as we were <unk> and <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, we actually started thinking and solve <unk> problems and <unk> problems.
The <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> to the way we <unk> most of the world around us.
So, as a <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of our <unk> with objects, together to my <unk> <unk>, and my <unk> <unk> <unk>, I started <unk>, "And if we use a computer, instead of just the <unk> of the <unk> as a computer <unk>, and it will <unk> an information with <unk>, <unk> <unk> with <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> an information, <unk> with both hands.
and <unk> to our <unk>?
The question was so interesting that I thought about the answer, building <unk>.
In a few words, a <unk> is a computer <unk> big as a <unk>.
In a few words, a <unk> is a computer <unk> big as a <unk>.
You can <unk> them with your hand, "<unk>" <unk> "between them," <unk> "between them," and they have a radio <unk>.
But <unk>, they're <unk> objects, like <unk>, you can just <unk> it.
<unk> are the example of a new tools to <unk> the digital information to <unk>.
And as they become more <unk>, <unk> of their <unk>, other, and as they become more <unk>, <unk> of their movement, others, of their own movement, others, of how we <unk> them, to <unk> new <unk> of <unk>.
Let's start with some simple example.
This <unk> is <unk> to show you about video: if you put it in a direction, the video so if you put it in a direction, the other side, you'll get back to.
These <unk> <unk> are <unk> of others.
If you <unk> them, you're <unk> what they're going to around them.
If they're <unk>, <unk> and they can <unk> a little bit.
If they're <unk>, <unk> and they can <unk> a little bit.
They also <unk> their movement and <unk>.
We realized that one of the interesting <unk> of the <unk> <unk> was that they could use common <unk> on data, for example, "<unk>" a color like a <unk>.
In this case, we have three <unk> <unk> as a <unk> of <unk> and I can <unk> to <unk> the color of central, where you go.
and I can <unk> it to <unk> of color in central color, where you're <unk>.
We can <unk> too much of it, we can <unk> it a little bit.
There's also a chance of <unk>, like <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, where people can try things quickly, and <unk> the results immediately.
Now I'm --
This is a sequence of <unk> that I do with a <unk> program.
Here we have a <unk> game <unk> and <unk>.
<unk>, at every <unk> <unk> a letter on every <unk>, <unk>, every <unk> <unk> a letter on every <unk>, and as I was <unk> to <unk> in <unk>, and he was <unk> on a <unk>.
And then after about 30 seconds you <unk>, and you have a new <unk> of <unk> and new <unk> to try to do.
Thank you.
Here's here some children in <unk> at the <unk> <unk>, I did the way I <unk> them and <unk> a video.
They're very <unk>.
And one of the interesting things of <unk> is that you don't have to give people many <unk>.
They just say, "<unk> <unk>," and they know what to do.
There we are other people who <unk> it.
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, right there on the right.
It actually wanted to <unk>.
They were just <unk>, for him.
Now, this is a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We had to build a tool for the <unk> of <unk>. He's <unk>.
It can <unk> new characters in the scene, <unk> their <unk>.
It can <unk> new characters in the scene, <unk> their <unk>.
So, it's <unk> out the sun.
<unk>: The sun is <unk>.
<unk>: Now he's <unk> a <unk> in the scene.
<unk>: The <unk> <unk>.
<unk> work! Yes!
So, <unk> the <unk> and <unk> can make the characters --
<unk>: <unk>!
<unk> your story.
<unk>: <unk>!
<unk>: It's a story with open, and it can decide him how they <unk>.
<unk>: It's a story with open, and it can decide him how they <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> away, <unk>.
<unk>: The last example I have time to show you is a <unk>, made of recently, to <unk> and <unk> music.
It's a <unk>, made of a recent <unk>, to <unk> and <unk> music.
<unk> here are <unk> by <unk> as basic, low and <unk>.
<unk> of these has four different <unk>, and you can choose which we use.
And you can also <unk> these <unk> in a sequence <unk> to your <unk>.
And we just <unk> a <unk> of a sound and a sequence.
These are the effects of control of alive, like <unk> and <unk>.
And it <unk> it to a particular sound and then <unk> to <unk> it.
And then there are the <unk> effects of as time and <unk>, who are <unk> to the entire sequence.
<unk> how it works.
<unk>: <unk> <unk>: <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk>, "sequence," <unk> in a series, the <unk>, <unk>.
Now, we're going to take a <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> now <unk>...
<unk>: And now I'm going to <unk> the <unk> to the <unk>, so I can control effect in the alive.
<unk>: <unk>: <unk>, I can <unk> the entire sequence <unk> the time on one, or the other.
<unk>: And now we're going to <unk> the bottom for more <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>: <unk> the sequence "<unk>" <unk> "to the flight."
So I don't have to <unk> before, but I can <unk>, <unk>, <unk> longer or more <unk>.
And now, finally, I can <unk> the whole sequence on the left the <unk> <unk>.
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is to build new <unk> <unk> <unk> to how our brain work and body.
And today, I've had time to show you one of the results of this <unk>, and also some possibilities that we try to bring out of the lab.
The concept I want to <unk> is that's going to <unk> this new generation of <unk> objects to <unk> with the <unk> media, that we want to <unk> in our world in the way we want.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the time I'm going to talk to all of you.
I'm a <unk>.
<unk> books is my <unk>, but it's more than that, obviously.
It's also love and the <unk> of my life.
And I don't expect that <unk> can change.
But, I said this, something particular happened in my life and my career, who led me to the whole relationship to this work.
The particular thing is that I <unk> wrote this book, this <unk> called "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
And the result of that is that <unk> now, people <unk> me as if I <unk>.
<unk> -- <unk>, <unk>.
<unk> up to me now, everybody's <unk> and they say, "Do you fear not fear of being able to do better than you know?
You don't fear <unk> to write all the <unk> of life without being able to create a book that can <unk> to someone? "
What can it do? "
It's <unk>, you know.
But it could go worse, except I remember that over 20 years ago, when I started to say to people -- I was an <unk> -- I wanted to be a <unk>.
I <unk> to the same <unk> <unk> from fear.
And people say, "Do you don't know you don't know you don't know you don't know you don't know you don't know you're going to be able to have a <unk>?
<unk>'t you fear the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk>?
Do you fear of doing this <unk> for all life without any <unk> from from <unk> to die of a <unk> of <unk> dreams with the mouth of <unk> <unk>? "
So, you know.
The <unk> answer to all these questions is, "Yes."
Yeah, I'm afraid of all those things.
I've always had fear.
And I also fear of many other things that people couldn't <unk>.
How <unk> and other things that are <unk>.
But, as it is to write what I thought and <unk> <unk> is why?
Is this <unk>?
It's <unk> that anybody who's <unk> <unk> to be <unk> by a job that you feel in order to do.
But what is so particular, in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> about health care about a way that other <unk> do not?
How about my father, for example, he was a <unk> <unk>, and I don't remember once in his <unk> years of <unk> in the 40 years of <unk>, if they're <unk> to be <unk>?
There was never -- that <unk> of <unk> John, how do you do that?
<unk>'t that that way, <unk>?
<unk>, engineers like <unk>, like group, engineers don't have <unk>, in <unk>, <unk> the <unk> of being <unk> <unk>.
We <unk>, we have enough this <unk>, and not just <unk>, but <unk> of all sorts, we have this <unk> of being <unk> <unk>.
And we don't know anything else that looking at the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that, only in the <unk> century, <unk> young and <unk>, for them.
And even those who are not <unk> seem to be really <unk> by their <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, before he died, in the last <unk> said, "Every book has <unk> me a little more." And a <unk> <unk> about the work of their own life.
But we don't know that we didn't know that, because we've heard these things so long that somehow we have completely <unk> and <unk> the <unk> that creativity and <unk> are somehow <unk> and <unk> that <unk> that creativity and <unk> are somehow <unk> and <unk>.
And the question I want to <unk> all here is you have this idea?
It's OK, you know, because it's also <unk> by a <unk> away to me. It's not good for this <unk>.
I think it's <unk>.
And I think it's also <unk>, and I don't want to <unk> in the next century.
I think it's better to <unk> our great <unk> to live.
And <unk> I know that, in my case -- in my case -- it would be very <unk> to start <unk> to that <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> the <unk> that I'm in my career.
<unk> -- <unk> look, I'm pretty young, I've got 40 years.
I have about four <unk> of work in me.
And it's very <unk> that anything that's going to happen now, it will be <unk> by the world like the work that after <unk> success of my last book.
<unk> <unk>, because we're all about as much friends here -- is <unk> that my greatest success is to my <unk>.
Oh, <unk>, <unk>, what I thought!
You know this is the kind of thought that brings a person to start <unk> to the nine to start <unk> at nine to the morning and I don't want to do that.
I want to keep doing this work that I love.
So, the question becomes, how?
And so it seems to me, after many <unk>, that the way to work to do is to create a <unk> <unk>, OK?
I have to have to be a few <unk> between me, which I'm <unk>, and the natural <unk> to which I'm <unk>, and the natural <unk> to <unk> that year. And as I was <unk> for this past year, looking for other society to see if you can look at the time and find out that they have better ideas and see if you <unk> ideas and find out that they have better ideas and <unk>
about how to help people <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity.
And that research led me to the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
It <unk> because they <unk> in <unk> and then <unk> back.
<unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> -- people don't believe that creativity <unk> from men, OK?
And he thought that creativity was this <unk> <unk>, and that <unk> to men from some <unk> <unk> and <unk>, for reasons <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> <unk> these <unk> <unk> of creativity. "<unk>."
<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> to have a <unk> that <unk> <unk> from far.
<unk> were the same idea, but they <unk> the <unk> of the same idea, but they <unk> the <unk> of the same idea, but they <unk> the <unk> of the same idea, but they <unk> the <unk> of the same idea, but they <unk> the <unk> of the same idea, but they would <unk> the same as a <unk>.
which is <unk>, because the <unk> didn't really believe that a <unk> was someone particularly.
I thought that a <unk> was this kind of <unk> <unk> that <unk> literally in the <unk> of the study of a artist, a little bit like the <unk> <unk>, and that <unk> out of <unk> <unk> the artist, and <unk> the result of that work.
<unk> <unk>, that's the distance I'm talking -- that <unk> <unk> that <unk> you from the results of your work work.
And we all thought that was so that we were <unk>, right?
So, <unk> artists were <unk> by <unk> things, like the too <unk>, you know?
If your work work was <unk>, you didn't <unk> the <unk>, everybody <unk> that was <unk> by this <unk> <unk> <unk>.
If your work <unk>, it wasn't all your <unk>, right?
And you know that was your <unk> to be a <unk>.
And so people <unk> <unk> creativity in <unk> for a long time.
And then the <unk> <unk> and all <unk>, and we <unk> this great idea; we put the human being at the center of the universe, above all of the universe and <unk> and <unk> and no longer <unk> space to the <unk>.
This was the <unk> principle and people started thinking that creativity was <unk> from <unk>.
And for the first time in history, you start <unk> to this artist or that artist as a rather <unk> person with <unk>.
And I have to <unk>, I think that was a big <unk>.
I think you can someone, a simple person to believe that being like a <unk> like the source, the source of all of the <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> and <unk> and <unk>, <unk> and <unk> is a responsibility too big to <unk> human <unk>.
It's like to ask someone to <unk> the sun.
<unk> and <unk> completely <unk> and <unk> all these <unk> <unk> and creates these <unk> <unk> on the <unk>.
And I think it was this pressure to have <unk> artists in <unk> 500 years.
And if this is true, and I think that's true, and the question is, and now?
Can we do that?
We could go back to a more <unk> understanding of human relationship between humans and <unk> <unk>.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we can't spend 500 years of thinking about <unk> in a 18 minutes.
And probably there are probably people in the audience who are <unk> <unk> <unk> on their <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, you know that <unk> people are <unk> <unk> on their projects.
We probably won't <unk> all about this.
But the question I want to ask you is -- why not?
Why don't we <unk> this way?
Because it makes more sense of anything that ever ever heard to explain the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> process.
A process that, as anyone who has ever <unk> to do something -- so, basically, everybody here -- knows, you don't know <unk>.
And in fact, it can <unk> look completely <unk>.
I did this meeting <unk> with the extraordinary <unk> <unk>, who has now 90 years, but that was a <unk> for all life and said that during his <unk> <unk>, he <unk> out in the <unk> <unk>, <unk> out in the <unk> <unk>, <unk> out in the <unk> <unk>, <unk> out in the <unk> <unk>.
And he said, like a <unk> <unk>.
And that <unk> towards her <unk>.
They <unk> it, because he was <unk> the land under his feet.
We thought we had just something to do that point and was, words, "<unk> like a <unk>."
And so he went to home and he came up with this <unk>, and he didn't have to take another piece of paper and a <unk> <unk> enough <unk> on the page.
Sometimes, we couldn't be fast enough, so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> without able to get to the house and the <unk> through the <unk> through and she would <unk> the <unk> through the <unk>, looking, and he would <unk> through the <unk>, looking, and he said, "another <unk>."
And then there were those times -- this is not going to <unk> it -- there were times when it was almost <unk>, right?
So, he was coming back back, and he was looking for paper and <unk> it through the <unk> through, and he <unk> a <unk> just in the while he was <unk>, and he was, that he was like he <unk> with the other hand and <unk>.
<unk> the <unk> from the tail and the <unk> in his body and the <unk> on the page.
And in these cases, the <unk> would be <unk> on the <unk> page and <unk>, but the <unk>, the <unk> word to the first word to the first word to the first word to the first.
So when I <unk> it <unk> -- it's <unk>, it's exactly <unk> to my <unk> process.
Not the whole process -- I'm not a <unk>!
I'm a <unk>, and my way of <unk> is; I love at the same <unk> every day and <unk> and <unk> and work on top of <unk>.
But even me in my <unk>, I <unk> against that thing, sometimes.
And I'm sure that many of you will have the <unk> made.
You know, even if the work and the ideas will <unk> me from a source I couldn't <unk> it.
And what is this thing?
And how can we <unk> it so that we don't lose your head, but rather, that <unk> us <unk> <unk>?
As I <unk>, the best example I have <unk> <unk>, which I've been <unk> <unk>, which I've spent several years ago for a <unk>.
We were talking about this, and you know, <unk>, for the <unk> of life was the <unk> of the artist's life's <unk> <unk>, looking at these <unk> <unk> species of totally <unk>.
But then <unk>, he <unk>, and one day as he was <unk> on a <unk> <unk> <unk>, he <unk> everything.
<unk> fast and everything is going to be <unk> this little <unk> of <unk>, who comes into his head as <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, and wants, you know, and the <unk>, but it doesn't know how to <unk>.
It's not a <unk> of paper, it's not a <unk>, it's not a <unk>.
So it starts to feel this kind of old <unk> <unk> in him, like, "I'm going to lose, and I'm going to <unk> this <unk> song.
I'm not <unk> enough, and I can't <unk> it. "
And instead of going to <unk>, they <unk>.
<unk> the whole <unk> process and made something completely new.
<unk> just the sky and said, "<unk>, you don't see I'm <unk>?"
"It seems to you that makes a song now?"
If you really want to <unk>, you'll be more <unk> when I can take care of you.
<unk>, we're going to <unk> to <unk> else today.
<unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk>. "
And his <unk> process, <unk> after this.
Not yet, the work was still <unk> as always.
But the process, and the <unk> <unk> that <unk> was <unk> when they <unk> the <unk>, the <unk> that outside him, the <unk> that the problems and <unk> it back from where it was, that it was <unk> that it didn't have to be a <unk> and <unk>.
but it was <unk> this <unk>, <unk> <unk> a conversation between <unk> and this <unk> thing that was <unk> and <unk> <unk>, but it was not <unk>.
So how I <unk> that story is going to change a little bit of the way I <unk> and I <unk> up once.
This idea, I was when I was <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, "and I'll go into one of the <unk> of the <unk> that we all work on something, and you can't start thinking it's going to be a <unk>, that's going to be the <unk> book.
Not just <unk>, just <unk>, just the <unk> book.
And we started thinking about this project.
But then I <unk> to <unk> that I <unk> into the air and <unk>.
So I <unk> my face on the <unk> and <unk> my <unk> to a <unk> <unk> of the room.
And I said high <unk>, "<unk>, what, we know, we know that if this book is not going to be <unk>, isn't it?
Because as you see, I'm <unk> everything I have, I don't have this anymore.
So if you want it to be better, you have to <unk> and do your part.
OK. But if you don't do that, you know what, I don't <unk> anything.
I started to write the same because it's my job.
And I want to say that I'm sure that I'm <unk> to do my part "Because at the end is like this, OK -- <unk> does in the <unk> Africa <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> to the <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk>, music that they would <unk> on for hours and hours to the <unk>.
And they were always <unk>, because the <unk> were <unk> and they were <unk>.
But every once a while, <unk>, something <unk>, and one of these <unk> artists actually <unk>.
And I know what I'm talking about, because I know you have seen it, everybody, at some point, a <unk> like this.
It was as if you <unk>, and the <unk> <unk> through a kind of <unk> and it was nothing different from the <unk>, like <unk> <unk> before, but it <unk>.
And suddenly we don't just <unk> as a human.
But it <unk> from <unk> and <unk> <unk> in the fire of <unk>.
And when this <unk>, people <unk> what he was, he was <unk> him with his name.
<unk> your hands and start <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, God," God. "
That's God, you know.
<unk> <unk> <unk> -- when the <unk> <unk> the <unk> of <unk>, you'll see this <unk> with them and the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, which you can still feel in the <unk> or the <unk>.
In <unk>, when a <unk> did something impossible and <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>," <unk>, <unk>, <unk> -- a <unk> of God.
And it's <unk> because we need it.
But the problem comes up the next day, for <unk> itself, when you <unk> and <unk> <unk> that are 11 <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> it.
It's just a <unk> with great <unk> to <unk>, and maybe you can never <unk> to that <unk> to the <unk>.
And maybe nobody <unk> the name of God still <unk>, and what does he have to do with the rest of his life?
It's hard.
This is one of the most <unk> <unk> to do in a <unk> life.
But maybe it doesn't have to be so <unk> if you can't believe, <unk>, that the most <unk> of your being come from you yourself.
But you just <unk> that you get data in <unk> from a source of this <unk> part of your life that you have to go to <unk> else when you're finished.
And, you know, if we think it's all change.
And so I started to <unk>, and it's a <unk> of the book that I <unk> soon during the book that I <unk> soon, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> of my success <unk>.
And what I have to keep <unk> when I feel <unk> from this is, I don't fear.
Don't <unk>. You just don't know your work.
<unk> <unk> for your part, any can be.
If your work is <unk>, <unk>.
If the <unk>, you'll be <unk> <unk> a few <unk> <unk> <unk> some kind of <unk>, for just a moment through your <unk>, "<unk>!"
<unk>, you do the same your <unk>.
And <unk>! "<unk>!" <unk> yourself.
I think it's <unk>. I think it's <unk>.
"<unk>!" <unk> "to you, even for having a human love and <unk> <unk> <unk> by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk>: <unk>!
You know, as I've already talked about some of these projects on human genome, what can <unk> and <unk> new genes of.
We're going to <unk> a new path: we started <unk> biology and now starting to <unk> biology and now from that digital code, we're <unk> in a new <unk> of biology, <unk> and <unk> life.
We always tried to <unk> the big questions.
"What's life?" It's something that many <unk>, I think have <unk> to understand at various levels.
We tried different <unk>, <unk> to <unk> terms.
We're <unk> for almost 20 years.
When we <unk> the human genome <unk> to <unk> from <unk> the world of biology to the digital biology to the computer the digital world.
Now, we can <unk> life, or create new life from this digital universe?
This is a map of a small <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, which is the species from the <unk> genome between those that can <unk> in the lab.
And we tried to reduce the genome to <unk> one more small.
We can <unk> a <unk> of about 500 genes that are about 500 of genes that are here.
But when we look at his map, it's just <unk> simple than our own.
<unk>, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can <unk>, one at a time, it's very <unk> that can bring a <unk> cell.
So we thought that the only way to <unk> was <unk> this <unk> so we could <unk> the <unk> to <unk> some of these questions.
And so we started the <unk> of the "<unk>, can we <unk> a <unk>?"
Can the chemistry <unk> to produce these big molecules that we've never been able to create these big molecules that we've never been able to create these big molecules that we've never been able to create these big molecules that we've never been able to <unk> that create these big molecules that we've
And in case we can make a <unk>?
A <unk> is just a piece of <unk> material.
The speed with which we can <unk> life is <unk> to <unk> <unk>.
Our ability to write the code, instead, <unk> rather slowly, but it's <unk>.
And our <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> on a <unk> <unk>.
We <unk> over 15 years ago.
The process has <unk> a lot of <unk>, <unk> with a <unk> <unk> before they <unk> the first experiments.
But we found that DNA <unk> is very hard.
There are <unk> of thousands of cars, to the world that small <unk> of DNA, <unk> <unk>, <unk> of 30 to 50 <unk> and it's a <unk> process, the <unk> is long, more <unk> there are.
So we had to develop a new way to <unk> these <unk> and <unk> the <unk>.
And this was our first <unk>, starting from information digital information of the genome of <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's a small virus that <unk> bacteria.
We designed <unk>, we <unk> the <unk> and <unk> a <unk> of DNA <unk> about <unk> <unk>.
The interesting part is when we took this piece of <unk> <unk> material and we <unk> it in the bacteria, the bacteria have <unk> to read this code and <unk> the <unk> particles.
<unk> particles have been <unk> by cells, are <unk> back and they <unk> the <unk> <unk>.
I've been talking recently with members of the <unk> industry that they certainly <unk> this model.
They've been <unk> more of you.
We think this is a situation where the software can actually build its <unk> in a <unk> system.
But we could do the bigger things.
We had to build the whole <unk> of the <unk>.
They are more than <unk> <unk> of <unk> code.
So we thought about <unk> in the <unk> of <unk>, so that we can change the <unk> to understand what the <unk> of a <unk> cell.
<unk> is <unk>, and if you start with information in a computer, they must be very <unk>.
When we <unk> this genome for the first time in <unk>, the standard <unk> was a <unk> for every 10 <unk> <unk>.
We've discovered, <unk>, 30 <unk>. If we were using that original sequence never be able to do that.
One part of the process is to design <unk> 50 <unk> that <unk> with all the other <unk> of 50 <unk> to build smaller <unk> that <unk> together.
And you'll see that <unk> elements here.
You've probably read that <unk> us about <unk>.
<unk> <unk>: we have a <unk> code on four <unk>: A, <unk>, <unk> and <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> of those <unk> <unk> together about 20 <unk>, and there's a <unk> order to <unk> every <unk>.
So we can use the code for writing words, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
What we did at the beginning was <unk>.
Some of them have been <unk> by the fact that it wasn't <unk>.
We designed these <unk> to <unk> just <unk> with <unk>.
There are <unk> that we <unk> them and <unk> them.
And we started to <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> so that they can <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to them until 24 <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk>.
But at every step, we have produced these <unk> in <unk> so that we're <unk> to create a very <unk> <unk>, as you'll see in a minute.
We're trying to <unk> the process.
So, this seems to be a <unk> of <unk>.
When you get to these very <unk>, very <unk>, more than 100 <unk>, you don't get any longer directly in the <unk> <unk>.
You get to the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> biology.
So we've <unk> some other <unk>.
We're going to talk about another <unk> called <unk> <unk>, which in biology <unk> to <unk> the DNA to <unk> the <unk>.
Here's an example.
This <unk>, called <unk> <unk>, can <unk> three million <unk> of <unk>.
You can see in the <unk> <unk> like his <unk> is <unk>.
In 12 hours, it's <unk> exactly as it was before.
<unk> thousands of organisms that are able to do that.
These organisms can <unk> completely.
We had to live under <unk>.
I'm absolutely sure that life <unk> in space, and you <unk> to find new <unk> of water.
Actually, NASA showed that this happens.
This is a picture of the <unk> that we've built using these <unk>, just using the <unk> with the <unk> <unk> design.
The <unk> <unk> <unk> them.
This image was not <unk> with a <unk> <unk>, but with a <unk> <unk>.
It's such a big <unk> that we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk>.
These are pictures that <unk> a <unk> period of about six seconds.
This is the <unk> we've done little time ago.
They are more than <unk> <unk> of <unk> code.
It's the largest <unk> of a <unk> structure ever <unk> by human <unk>.
It's got a <unk> weight at 300 million.
If you <unk> it with a <unk> 10 and without spaces, we'll take pages to <unk> this <unk> code.
Now, how do we make it work? How can we <unk> it?
<unk>, of course, is a kids game.
It's a little bit more <unk> when you're using bacteria.
It's easier when it comes to the <unk> cells like our <unk>: you can just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> another, which is <unk> process.
In <unk>, <unk>, it's <unk> instead of <unk> into the cell, but we have <unk> <unk> that we're able to do a <unk> <unk> from a <unk> <unk> of a <unk> cell to another and <unk>.
We <unk> a <unk> <unk> from a species.
<unk> are different as men from <unk>.
We <unk> some <unk> <unk> in more <unk> that we can decide which to <unk> for this <unk>.
He then <unk> it with <unk> so that he <unk> all the <unk>.
And when we put it in the cell, and we <unk> our <unk> <unk> the new <unk> went into the cell.
And we <unk> <unk> that we won't go beyond, but we tried to <unk> more in there.
This is one of the biggest <unk> of evolution.
We discovered that <unk> species have <unk> a second or a third <unk> somewhere, <unk>, <unk> in a second thousands of new <unk> to that species.
So who thinks about evolution as a only <unk> at a time you <unk>'t really <unk> the <unk> of biology.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that DNA.
The <unk> that was in the cell, they didn't buy one.
The <unk> <unk> we <unk> it.
It's <unk>, and it <unk> the other <unk> as <unk> material, and <unk> it, and we just <unk> with the cell and the new <unk>.
It's become blue because of the genes we've <unk>.
And in a short short time, all of a <unk> of a species have gone <unk>, and it <unk> of all of a new species, <unk> on the new software that we <unk> in the cell.
All the <unk> are <unk>, the <unk> are <unk>, and when you <unk> the <unk> code, you can exactly what we've <unk>.
Now, this may seem <unk>, but it's <unk> the software, we can change the <unk> <unk>.
Now, I've already <unk> that we're not talking about <unk> -- but of progress from three and a half million years of evolution, and a half million years of evolution, and I already said that maybe we're going to create new <unk> version of the <unk> <unk> that we <unk> new species on this digital process.
Why do that?
I think it's quite <unk> when we think about our <unk>.
We're going to go from six and a half billion people to <unk> billion over the next 40 years.
Just to give an example: I was born in <unk>.
There are three people on the planet to <unk> in <unk>; in 40 years, there will be four.
We're <unk> problems now to find food, <unk> and <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, <unk> and <unk> for six billion people.
We'll even more <unk> to do it for nine billion.
<unk> more than five billion <unk>, over 30 billion <unk>, over 30 billion <unk>.
That means 100 million <unk> a day.
When we try to find <unk> <unk>, or any kind of process to <unk>, it's going to be a huge challenge.
<unk> we have to realize all of CO2 <unk> from these materials that <unk> in the atmosphere.
And today, because of the <unk> <unk> <unk> around the world, we have a <unk> with about 20 million genes, and I like to think that are <unk> <unk> for the future.
<unk> industry <unk> only one <unk> about <unk>, and think about how many different things are <unk> out.
Our <unk> here is <unk> data from reality and our <unk>.
We now have <unk>, because of these <unk> <unk> <unk>, able to create what we call <unk> <unk>.
We can build a big robot that can produce a big robot that can produce a million <unk> a day.
Think about <unk> these 20 million genes or <unk> to try to <unk> the <unk> to produce <unk> or <unk>, new <unk>, and can change, with a small team, and create more <unk> biology now that in the last 20 years of science.
And it's just a standard <unk>.
We can choose to <unk>, chemistry or <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
This is a <unk> of some <unk> software that we're working on to be able to <unk> and design species to the computer.
Well, we don't know how they will they be.
We know exactly what their code is.
We're going to <unk> on the next generation.
You've seen that <unk> <unk> from the <unk> was an experiment wrong experiment.
We <unk> second and third generation that we <unk> quite soon from <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> as <unk> or different kinds of <unk>.
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the <unk> would be <unk> CO2 in matter before, so we're working to design cells that can achieve that to design cells that can achieve that one of the first generation of <unk> in about 18 months.
<unk> <unk> with CO2 is a <unk>, but in our <unk> of <unk>, but in our <unk> around the world, we found different <unk>.
This is a <unk> that we've <unk> in <unk>.
<unk> in the ocean, at about <unk> feet of <unk> at the <unk> of water.
We can <unk> from CO2 using hydrogen <unk> as a source of energy.
We're trying to understand if we can <unk> CO2, which can easily be <unk> by <unk>, <unk> that CO2 in <unk>, to drive this process.
So short, the short <unk> we might be able to <unk> what the basic question, "which is what life is," We, <unk>, we have the <unk> goal of <unk> the whole industry.
<unk>. If you can't do it from TED, where can't you do it?
We had a <unk> source of energy.
And also, we're working for the same <unk> to create <unk> <unk>.
You've seen this year with flu, we're always back a year and with a dollar in less when you're going to find the <unk> right.
I think what you can change by building <unk> in <unk>.
This is how the future could begin to look like <unk>, now, the tree of evolution, <unk> the evolution with bacteria, <unk>, and finally cells.
We are so much about <unk> people.
Our goal is to make it so that we can live long enough to try to <unk>. Thank you very much.
So first of all, I'm going to quickly, some fundamental <unk>, new technology that we've taken on <unk> <unk> to a <unk> <unk>, almost a year ago. It's <unk>.
This is a environment where you can <unk> is on the local level that <unk> with a huge amount of <unk> data.
Here we're seeing <unk> <unk> of <unk> with a kind of <unk> <unk> and <unk>, for a fast <unk>, <unk> the images like we want.
And it doesn't matter how big the amount of information that we see, how big these <unk> of data or <unk>.
Most of them are <unk> photographs, but this is a <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of <unk>, and <unk> it into the <unk> of 300 <unk>.
It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that <unk> the <unk> of a system like this is the number of <unk> on your screen at any time. It's also a very <unk> architecture.
This is a whole book, example of data, not of images.
This is the <unk> <unk> <unk>. Every <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk>.
And to <unk> that's a <unk> and not of <unk>, we can do something like that, to actually <unk> that's a real <unk> of text, not a picture.
It could be a way to read a book.
You won't <unk> it.
This is a more <unk> example. This is a number of 99.
Every big picture is the beginning of a <unk>.
And it really gives you the pleasure and the beautiful experience of reading the real version of a <unk> or a <unk>, which is for nature <unk> a <unk> <unk>, which is for nature.
We also did something with this one of this particular number of The <unk>.
We created a <unk> <unk> <unk> much <unk> than that you use in a normal <unk> and we have <unk> you to the content.
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk>, you can see here.
Or some <unk>, or even the <unk> <unk>.
And this really <unk> some of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of space on the screen.
We thought this is going to take take the <unk> and other <unk> like that, you can't have to be <unk>.
Now, the <unk> is one of the most <unk> <unk> for this kind of technology.
And on this this is not going to lose time, if not to say that we have <unk> to <unk> from this field.
These are all the streets in the United States <unk> above a NASA <unk>.
So now we're going to go to something else.
This is actually alive on the web; you can see it.
This is a project called <unk>, which <unk> two different technologies.
One is <unk> and the other is a <unk> <unk> computer that's very interesting that <unk> <unk>, a student of the <unk> of Washington, with the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>. A <unk> <unk>.
And it's alive on the web, <unk> by <unk>.
You can <unk> when we do this kind of <unk>, where we can go from a picture to the other and have this kind of experience <unk>.
But the <unk> <unk> of the images here has actually a meaning.
<unk> <unk> of <unk> computers have <unk> these images together, so that they <unk> to the <unk> places where the <unk> all <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> have been <unk>. Here you see some <unk> of a <unk> or <unk>, and these things have been <unk> at the <unk> level.
I don't know if I've been to show you some other environment.
There are a lot more <unk>.
I want to go directly to one of the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> data, and this is <unk> by a <unk> <unk> of <unk> that we have done for the first time in <unk> to show you what <unk> is really the key behind this technology, the <unk>. And it's not that as <unk> looking at the <unk> that we've <unk> in the website.
We had to <unk> some <unk> and <unk>.
This is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> images. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> images of types in <unk>, other <unk> and saying. <unk> of these <unk> <unk> and so on. And so, you know, <unk> <unk> <unk> a picture that's discovery.
So, they're all <unk> <unk> and they've got all <unk> on a <unk> level in this way.
And you can see it this <unk> way.
You know, I'd never thought of end up to work.
It's very <unk> to <unk> this kind of <unk> here.
I think you can see that it's a lot of different <unk>: from those cell cell phones, from those <unk> <unk>, a <unk> number, <unk> together in this environment.
And if I can, I can try and look at those <unk>.
Many of them are <unk> <unk>, etc.
And somewhere here you find a series of photographs -- <unk>.
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We can go from <unk> to the physics of this environment.
The <unk> point is that we can do things with social environment. This is now <unk> data from <unk> from the entire entire memory of how to <unk> the earth, from the <unk> perspective, and <unk> all that data together.
All of those pictures become <unk> together, more than the <unk>.
You have a whole model that you'll see.
Think about this as <unk> of the work of <unk> <unk> on Earth.
It's something that <unk> in <unk> as people <unk>, and they <unk> for who are <unk> for the people who are <unk> with the use use.
Their pictures are <unk> with <unk> <unk> by other people.
If someone comes the idea of <unk> all these <unk> <unk>, my name, my picture of <unk> <unk> <unk>, you'll see all that data, and I can use it as a <unk> <unk> to space in that <unk>, using the <unk> of anybody, and have a social experience kind of <unk> and <unk>.
And of course, a <unk> of all of this is very <unk> models of every interesting part of the land, not just <unk> by <unk> <unk> and images and <unk> images and <unk> and <unk> images. But like that,
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Do I realized? What your software <unk> us to do is, at some point, in the next few years, all the photographs that's world will be <unk> together?
<unk>: Yeah. What's doing is <unk> to find out.
It's creating <unk>, if you want, between images.
And it's doing it in the content of images.
And the thing becomes very interesting if you think about <unk> information information that a lot of these <unk> images.
As you do a <unk> of images on the web, you <unk> a <unk> and the <unk> on the web has a lot of information about the images of the pictures.
Now, what happens if that picture <unk> all your picture?
So the amount of <unk> <unk> and the amount of <unk> that <unk> is really enormous. It's a <unk> effect of the network.
CA: <unk>, it's really amazing.
<unk>: I'm going to <unk> you a lot.
One of the major <unk> when you <unk> and one of the <unk> of research <unk> is the to live in the <unk> <unk>, including the past <unk>, the wind <unk>, and <unk> it in the <unk> <unk> of plants.
You might think that <unk> <unk> <unk> still beyond <unk> <unk>, or that the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> are still <unk> of <unk>, or that in <unk>, the <unk> <unk> still the <unk> of the <unk>, to remember the <unk> of the <unk>, and that the idea that the world in which we live in there is no sense, but it's just a model of reality,
the <unk> of a particular <unk> of <unk> choices that our <unk> did, well or bad or bad, a lot of <unk> does.
And, of course, all of the <unk> <unk>.
Everybody <unk>. Everybody <unk>.
We're <unk> to <unk>.
We have to deal with the <unk> of death, so we don't <unk> if we <unk> and <unk> --
We all have a art.
What <unk> is the particular <unk> of the song, the <unk> of the <unk> of every culture of the culture of the <unk> of every culture.
It doesn't matter whether it's the <unk> of the <unk>, or the <unk> of <unk>, or the <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk>, or <unk> <unk> <unk>, or a <unk> in the <unk>'s heart.
And he was my <unk> of a journey in <unk> a month ago, or a <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk>, on the <unk>, the <unk>'s mother's <unk>.
All of these <unk> <unk> that there are other ways of thinking, other ways of to think, other ways of moving around the world.
And if you <unk> a moment, it's a concept that can give you hope.
<unk>, the <unk> of the world create a <unk> of <unk> and <unk> that <unk> the planet and it's important for the <unk> of the planet, as the <unk> <unk> note as <unk>.
And you can think of this <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and you can <unk> the total <unk> of all the <unk> of all the <unk>, dreams, ideas, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> in being by the human imagination from the human imagination from the <unk> of the <unk>.
<unk> is the great <unk> of humanity.
It's the <unk> of what we are and what we can be as <unk> species.
And <unk> the <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> has been to <unk> and <unk> much faster.
<unk> <unk>, for example, <unk> that 50 percent of all species has been or is on the <unk> of <unk>, because it's <unk>, or <unk>, or <unk> -- in the field of <unk> diversity -- and you don't even <unk> to the <unk> <unk> -- that of the <unk> diversity.
The <unk> of this is, of course, the <unk> <unk>.
When you're <unk> <unk> <unk> on this planet.
A language is not just <unk> by a <unk> or a series of rules.
One is the <unk> of the human spirit.
It's the medium that the <unk> of every culture gets in the material.
Every language is a forest of the mind, a <unk>, a <unk>, a <unk> of <unk>.
And of those <unk> <unk>, as we're sitting here in <unk>, at least half doesn't <unk> in the <unk> of children.
They don't get to <unk>, which means, unless you <unk> something, which is already death.
What's more <unk> than the <unk> of being <unk>, of being the last one of the <unk>, to be the last <unk> or to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> or <unk> the children?
This <unk> <unk> has been a few weeks, and every two weeks: every two weeks: every two weeks: every two weeks, a <unk> <unk> and <unk> it <unk> in the <unk> <unk> of a <unk> language.
And I know that someone of you say, "<unk>'t that better?
The world would not be a better place if we could all the same language? "<unk>, then we all talk about <unk>.
<unk> <unk>.
<unk> of a <unk> thing is to say, you can't talk about their language.
And I'd like to do you today on a journey through the <unk> --
a small journey in the <unk> to give you a <unk> of what we're <unk>.
Many of us <unk> that when I say, "different ways of <unk>," I mean really different ways of <unk>.
So, for example, <unk> <unk>, in <unk> <unk>, the <unk> of <unk>, who <unk> to the <unk> of <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's a <unk> that's not able to <unk> the blue color from green because the <unk> <unk> is <unk> in the <unk> of the forest that we <unk> the <unk>.
They have a <unk> language and a rule <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
And all of this has <unk> in the past <unk>, but the <unk> is that in these <unk> families, where they're talking about six or seven <unk> because of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> no <unk>.
They <unk> up and then we started talking.
I <unk> one of the most interesting <unk> that I lived with, the <unk> of <unk> <unk>, an incredible <unk> that had the first <unk> in <unk>.
In <unk> five <unk> have <unk> contact a <unk> <unk>.
They've <unk> <unk> photographs that <unk> them in <unk> that <unk> <unk>, <unk> that this <unk> of the <unk> forest <unk> never seen anything.
They <unk> the picture of the ground, they <unk> to find a form or a <unk> and, not <unk> anything, they <unk>, and they <unk> the five <unk> with the <unk>.
But the <unk> isn't just about the <unk>.
They <unk> to each other.
<unk> percent of <unk> was <unk> by them.
We went to eight <unk> and we found two <unk> of death and we found two natural death and when we <unk> to know, they <unk> that they <unk> out, and then they <unk> it. They <unk> it. And then they <unk> it. And then they <unk> it. And they <unk> it.
<unk> were able to recognize the animal <unk> 40 <unk> and <unk> the species.
In the early <unk>, I was <unk> a really interesting task when my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> me if I wanted to go to <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> to do <unk>.
And to <unk> a sense of <unk>, I should understand the <unk> culture, and that <unk> is not <unk> <unk>.
It's pretty much of a <unk> vision of the world.
Very interesting.
If you <unk> to <unk> the great <unk> of the world's great <unk>, what do you think about?
<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, etc.
A continent is always <unk> out, thinking that Africa doesn't have <unk> <unk>. And instead, and the <unk> is not anything else that the <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> during the <unk> <unk> of <unk>.
What makes interesting to <unk> is the <unk> relationship between life and death.
So <unk> <unk> <unk> up the <unk>.
<unk> can be <unk> by the <unk> <unk>, <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> <unk> to the live in the <unk> of the alive in a way that for a short <unk> the <unk>.
So, for the <unk> <unk> to say, "<unk>, you go to <unk> to speak about God.
We <unk> in <unk> and <unk> God. "
And since you're <unk>, is the spirit that you're driving you, how do you get you wrong with it?
So you're <unk> to these incredible events: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a rather <unk> of the power of mind, when it's <unk> in a state of <unk> <unk>.
I <unk> all the <unk> that I lived with the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, in the <unk> <unk>.
<unk> of the <unk> civilization is <unk> that once on the <unk> <unk> of <unk> in <unk>, the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk>.
In a blood continent <unk>, this <unk> never been <unk> by <unk>.
In <unk>, I'm <unk> by a <unk>, but their education is extraordinary.
<unk> <unk> are <unk> away from <unk> to <unk> <unk>, and they live <unk> in a world <unk> and <unk> in a world <unk> <unk> and <unk> to the basis of <unk> for 18 years.
Two <unk> <unk> <unk>.
For all this time, they're <unk> to their society, values that <unk> their <unk> and only their <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or to say the <unk> <unk> -- or to say the <unk> <unk>.
At the very term of this <unk> <unk>, they're <unk> out and for the first time in their lives, they see a <unk>. And in that moment of the first <unk>, when the sun comes down the <unk> <unk>, everything they've learned in a theory of the first <unk>, when the sun comes <unk> <unk>, everything they have learned in his <unk>. The <unk> does a <unk> <unk> <unk>, everything that they have learned in a <unk> theory. The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>,, everything that <unk> is is all <unk>
"<unk>? Let's look like I said.
It's <unk>. Now it's going to be <unk>. "
They are <unk> and they say that we, <unk> <unk>, we are the <unk> of the world's <unk>.
This <unk> level is extremely important.
When we think of <unk> <unk> and the <unk> environment, and the <unk> environment of the <unk> <unk>, which is a <unk> concept in his <unk> or maybe maybe <unk> and say that these <unk> are <unk> to the Earth.
<unk> <unk> are not <unk> or <unk> from <unk>.
There's no space for these things in the <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> of <unk>, but because of time and <unk>, have created a <unk> of the Earth <unk> <unk>, <unk> not on the concept of <unk> <unk> <unk>, but on a <unk> <unk>, but a <unk> <unk>: the concept that the Earth can only live only because it is <unk> by the human <unk>.
What does that mean?
Let me say that a <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> <unk> the mountain is a <unk> spirit that <unk> its <unk> will be a <unk> different human being and will have a very different <unk> and will have a <unk> different <unk>, or that <unk> a mountain <unk> of <unk> that <unk> <unk> that a mountain is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> to be <unk>.
<unk> it is a <unk> of a spirit or a <unk> <unk> is <unk>.
What's interesting is the <unk> that <unk> the relationship between the <unk> and the natural world.
I grew up in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that the <unk> <unk> to be <unk>.
That made me a human being different from my friends who believe that <unk> are the <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
If you can <unk> that these <unk> can actually create reality, different, we can start to understand some of their <unk> <unk>. They can be this <unk>.
I <unk> this picture in <unk> in the <unk> <unk>.
Maybe some of you have heard about <unk>, the most powerful <unk> of the <unk> <unk>.
What makes <unk> <unk> is not the potential to <unk> of the <unk> of <unk>, but his <unk>. It's <unk> by two elements.
On one side, this <unk> <unk> <unk> a series of <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
<unk> the only has a <unk> <unk> that <unk> a little bit of <unk>, but it's <unk> with the <unk> of a <unk>'s family <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This <unk> has <unk> <unk>, very similar to <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
If you ever see the <unk> <unk> on the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, the <unk> has <unk>.
<unk> that <unk> on the <unk> is a little bit of like being <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a sea of electricity. It doesn't create a <unk> of reality; it makes the <unk> of reality.
I often was <unk> with my <unk>, Richard <unk> <unk>, the man who <unk> the <unk> was <unk>, with his discovery of the <unk> <unk> in the '<unk>.
<unk> to my <unk>, you can't <unk> these <unk>, because if you're done, you can't tell anybody to be <unk>. <unk>, but they can't be <unk> because they're <unk> by a <unk> that's of course in <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
It's possible to <unk> only <unk> if you <unk> with other <unk> <unk> that <unk> the <unk>.
Now, the <unk> is the <unk> that you find in this <unk> are <unk>, the same kind of necessary to <unk> the <unk>. The question <unk> question: in a <unk> of plants, like these <unk> <unk> two <unk> not similar, but that if you <unk> in this way, they create a <unk> version of the <unk>?
We use the great <unk> of <unk> and <unk>, which can <unk>.
But if we go to the <unk>, we'll get "The plants talk about it."
What does that mean?
This <unk>, the <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, who <unk> <unk> in the forest, and that our eyes will <unk> in the same species.
If you know how to <unk> their <unk>, we <unk>, "<unk> of plants, the rest't you know it?" I said, "No."
The solution is: you take the <unk> <unk> in a night <unk> with a different <unk>.
And you don't <unk> to <unk>, but it's a lot more interesting to <unk> the <unk>.
Now, the problem is that even those of us who have heart <unk> <unk> them, but somehow <unk> them, they <unk>, but somehow <unk> to the <unk> of history of the real world than our real world, and it's <unk>.
In fact, the <unk> century, <unk>, not <unk> <unk> for his <unk> or his <unk> <unk>, but rather like the one that we <unk> and <unk> <unk>, but rather like the one of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the planet's diversity and <unk> on the planet. Now the problem is not the change.
All the <unk> through the <unk> have been <unk> in a <unk> for new <unk> of life.
And the problem is not technology.
<unk> <unk> don't have <unk> to be <unk> when they put <unk> <unk> and <unk> as they don't have <unk> to be <unk> when they put in the <unk> and <unk>.
It's not the change or technology that <unk> the <unk> of <unk>. It's the power.
The <unk> <unk> of <unk>.
And if you look at the world, you'll see that these are not <unk> <unk> to <unk>.
They are <unk> creatures and <unk> <unk> out of the <unk> of <unk> forces that are beyond their <unk> ability.
<unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> --
a <unk> <unk> of <unk>, in <unk> <unk>, a <unk> that has lived in the forest until a generation ago, and now <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk>, where you can see the <unk> <unk> from the <unk> that <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>,
We started to <unk> <unk> with the <unk> <unk> to the forest.
Or, in the case of <unk>, are the diseases that are <unk> with the <unk> discovery of.
If we <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk>, where I'm doing a lot of research, you'll see the <unk> <unk> of politics.
As a <unk>, <unk> physics of a <unk>, is <unk> <unk>, is <unk> at the <unk> level, but the <unk>, the <unk> of <unk>'s life, not just <unk>, but <unk> <unk> in certain <unk>, because it's part of the development of <unk>.
And you can't understand the <unk> of the <unk> until you go the beginning.
I <unk> <unk> miles from <unk> to China through the <unk> <unk>, <unk> to <unk> with a young <unk>, but only got to <unk> with a young <unk>, but only got to <unk> what's behind the <unk> that you're talking about.
<unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> million people <unk> from the <unk> during the <unk> <unk>.
The father of this guy was <unk> to the <unk> <unk>.
which means that it's been <unk> to the Chinese <unk>.
<unk> <unk> is <unk> with <unk> <unk> during the <unk> that <unk> that led the <unk> in <unk>.
My mother was <unk> and his <unk> was to be <unk>.
It was taken of <unk> in <unk> at age two <unk> under his <unk> because he couldn't have to live without him.
The <unk>, who did the same, was <unk> in <unk>.
One day has <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> and, for this <unk>, was <unk> to this <unk>, was <unk> to the <unk> work for seven years.
The pain of <unk> can be <unk>, but the <unk> spirit of <unk> is <unk> by <unk> present.
And it turns out, it's all about a choice.
Do we live in the <unk> world, or we want to <unk> the <unk> world of diversity of <unk>?
The great <unk> <unk>, first of death, before he died, he said his greatest fear was that, in our going to <unk> to this <unk> vision of the world, not just <unk> the entire <unk> of human imagination to a <unk> <unk> to a <unk> <unk> that there were other possibilities.
And it's <unk> to remember that our species is <unk> for <unk> years.
The <unk> <unk>, who has given us to agriculture, that made us <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk>, <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> with the <unk> of <unk>, creating the <unk> of <unk>, and we talk about <unk> years ago.
The <unk> world has to <unk> 300 years.
And that <unk> story I didn't tell you that we have the answers to all the challenges that we can <unk> in the <unk> to come.
When we <unk> <unk> of the world is asked what it means to be human, they're <unk> with different <unk>.
And it's in these answers that we all <unk> the possibility of being what we are: a <unk> species, that has to <unk> all the <unk> and all the <unk> can <unk>. And there's great moments of <unk>.
I <unk> this picture on the north of <unk> <unk>, when I went to <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk>, and this man, <unk> me the wonderful story of his <unk>.
The <unk> government has not always <unk> with the <unk> <unk> and in the '<unk> to <unk> our <unk>, we <unk> them in <unk>.
The <unk> of this man is <unk> of <unk>.
The family, <unk> for his life, <unk> <unk> all the <unk>, and all his <unk>.
You should know that <unk> don't <unk> the cold, we'll <unk> it.
The <unk> of <unk> <unk> were made fish <unk> in the skin of <unk>.
The <unk> of this man didn't <unk> from the night or <unk> from the <unk> that he <unk>.
It's <unk> away, it <unk> the <unk> in the skin of <unk> and <unk> into your hand. When I did it <unk>, they <unk> it into a <unk>.
It's <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk> of <unk>, and when <unk> <unk>, he <unk> a dog.
It <unk> the dog and created a <unk>, with the <unk> <unk> created a <unk>, has <unk> a <unk>, has <unk> a <unk>, and <unk> <unk> on the <unk>, <unk> <unk> in <unk>.
Do you want to talk to anything?
<unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> government <unk> to <unk> the total control of an area of bigger <unk> area of <unk> bigger <unk> in California and <unk> together.
It's their new <unk>. It's called <unk>.
It's a <unk> <unk>. It <unk> all the resources that are <unk>.
One example of how a <unk> can <unk> with his <unk>.
And, finally, I think it's pretty <unk> at least to the <unk> of the planet, <unk> that they don't <unk> at all.
For someone is home.
<unk> <unk> of the human imagination that we <unk> to the <unk> of the time. And for all of us, the dreams of these children, they become part of the <unk> hope.
And finally, we're <unk> <unk> that <unk> are <unk> that <unk> never <unk> to anything.
I <unk> that <unk> --
They <unk>, they're not <unk>, but we believe that stories can change the world, and maybe we are the best <unk> to tell the stories of the world. Every month our <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> million <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> our <unk>.
Our <unk> are <unk> by millions.
Our work is <unk> in <unk> to bring our audience to bring our audience to <unk> our <unk> from which <unk> away from how much they saw from and, <unk>, <unk> to <unk> the <unk> world, and we have to find a <unk> <unk> world, and we have to find a <unk> world and <unk>
where the <unk> of all the <unk> can <unk> to our <unk> <unk>.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some things that I've written in this book that I hope is <unk> and <unk> to <unk> some <unk>, in case you've not seen them.
I want to start with what I call the <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> of what?
The <unk> <unk> of all <unk> society. The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>: "If we <unk> the <unk> of our citizens," The way to do it is to <unk> freedom. "
The reason is, on one side, in fact that freedom that freedom is itself a value, is <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> for humans.
On the other one is that if we are <unk>, every one of us can act to do all of us to do what we're going to do our <unk>, without any any <unk> in name in our.
The way to <unk> the freedom is to <unk> choice.
The more choices are, the more choices, and the more they are, the greater is their <unk>.
This, <unk>, <unk>, is so <unk> <unk> in the society that nobody <unk> to <unk> in <unk>.
And it's also <unk> <unk> in our lives.
I'm going to show you some examples of what progress made possible.
This is my <unk>. It's not that big.
I <unk> a simple note on the <unk> to <unk>.
In my <unk>, there's <unk>, there's no <unk> the 10 <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and the 12 <unk> <unk> that you can buy for a huge number of <unk> in the <unk> <unk> that nobody of the <unk> already is to your <unk>.
Here's what the <unk> is how the <unk>.
Then you go to the <unk> store for buy a <unk>: <unk>, <unk>, radio, <unk>, <unk>, radio, <unk>, <unk>.
And in this single <unk> store, there's a big number of <unk> <unk>.
We can make six and a half million different <unk> using the <unk> that there are in one <unk>.
<unk> <unk> that there is <unk> choice.
<unk> <unk>: the world of <unk>.
Once I was a child, you could all of the <unk> <unk>, to <unk> that were <unk> by <unk> <unk>.
You <unk> the phone, you don't <unk> it.
And a <unk> of that, by the way, was that the phone was never <unk>.
These days, they have gone.
We now have a <unk> <unk> of <unk>, especially <unk>.
Here's cell phones.
My <unk> is in the middle, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> for the <unk> <unk>.
If you don't have it yet seen in the <unk> <unk>, you're very sure you'll soon be going to go.
And what happens is that people <unk> in <unk> and does this question. And what's going on is the answer? The answer is, "No."
You can't buy a cell phone that doesn't make things.
So in other <unk> of life that are much more important than <unk>, they're <unk> the same <unk> of choices.
<unk> <unk>: It doesn't happen to the United States that you're <unk> from the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> you what you have to do.
Instead, <unk> out of the <unk>, and the <unk> says, "OK, we might do A, or <unk>," or <unk>, "A," or <unk>, "he's got these <unk> and these <unk>.
You <unk> them, "<unk>, what do you do?"
And the <unk> says, "<unk> has these <unk> and these <unk>, and <unk> has these <unk> and these <unk>."
"What do you want to do?"
And you say, "<unk> if you were me, what do you know?"
And the <unk>: "But I'm not her."
The result of the <unk> we call it "<unk>", "<unk>", "<unk> that makes it look good.
But it's not that a <unk> the weight and the responsibility to make decisions from someone who knows something, <unk> the <unk>, to <unk>, to <unk> the other that doesn't know -- and it's certainly not <unk> -- and it's not <unk> to make the patient.
There's a huge <unk> of <unk>, <unk> to people like me and you, that if you think about it doesn't make sense, because we can't <unk>.
But if we can't <unk>, why do we <unk>?
The answer is they want you to <unk>, we call the <unk> to <unk> the <unk>.
<unk> so fundamental as it is our <unk> <unk> is a <unk> of choice, as you can see in this <unk>. "We don't want to <unk> children. We don't want to <unk> the children. We don't <unk> a <unk>: we have to <unk> the children. We don't have to <unk> the children. We have to <unk> the <unk>.
And we can <unk> how many times we <unk>.
which means that every <unk>, at the <unk>, you have to decide what kind of person,
We <unk> to the family and the <unk>, a common time perspective, and <unk> perspective, and it <unk> to be as soon as possible, and you start to <unk> their children as soon as possible.
The only real choice was to those, not when, and they didn't even what to do after.
<unk>, it's really to play.
They <unk> to very smart, and they <unk> 20 percent less <unk> than a time.
And not because they're <unk>, not because they're less <unk>.
but why they're <unk>, <unk> to <unk>: "<unk> <unk> or not?"
"<unk> <unk>. <unk> I have to think about the children or the career?"
I'm <unk> <unk>.
And they try to answer these questions, even if this <unk> doesn't <unk> the <unk> that <unk> and not get a good <unk> to my <unk>.
And they have to do that. They're important questions.
Now, the work: we're <unk>, as <unk> <unk>, because technology <unk> us to work every minute, every day, from the planet, <unk> that from the <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, there's a <unk>, and I won't say anybody, where the <unk> works.
I'm not saying this, because I want to use it.
What does this mean, this incredible freedom to choice that we have about the work? Is that we have to decide, <unk> at any time, if we have to work or not.
We can go to see our son to play <unk>, with a cell phone, the <unk> into the other, and the <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
And even though I'm <unk>, every minute we see our son, we're also <unk> the <unk>, we're also <unk>, "I answer to this call?"
"<unk> I have to <unk> this? I have to <unk> this letter?"
And even when the answer is, "not," that makes this <unk> experience of your son very different from what would would be in other conditions.
So, from any part of us, and big things, <unk> objects and big and <unk> of life, life is a question of choices.
Once the world was this: <unk>, there were some possibilities, but it wasn't a <unk> of choice.
The world today's going to come to this: <unk> is a <unk> thing, or <unk>?
The answer is <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> we know them all, so I'm going to talk about the <unk>.
We <unk> this choice is two effects of <unk> people.
The first one, <unk>, is that <unk> <unk> instead of <unk>.
With a lot of <unk> between which you choose, it becomes very hard to do.
I'll give you an example, a <unk> study on <unk> <unk> <unk>.
A <unk> has <unk> access, <unk> <unk>, <unk> society, <unk> <unk> society, with <unk> <unk>, about a million <unk> <unk> in <unk>.
What she discovered is that for every 10 <unk> that are <unk>, the <unk> of <unk> <unk> two percent.
<unk> <unk>, there's 10 percent less than <unk> than <unk> when they are only five to be five percent. Why?
Because with 50 <unk> between which <unk>, you're going to have to decide, and choice is <unk> to <unk>.
And <unk>, and still <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and of course <unk>, and <unk> never comes.
<unk> that means that these <unk> <unk> <unk> food to <unk> because they don't have enough money, it means that the decision <unk> is so <unk> that you also have the decision <unk> of <unk> work.
They don't know, they're <unk> up to five <unk> per year from work, which would well be <unk> to <unk>.
So <unk> is a <unk> of having <unk> choices.
And I think we're going to change the world like this.
"And finally, to end, for <unk>: <unk>, <unk> or <unk>?"
You want to make the right decision, if it's for <unk>, right?
You don't want to choose the wrong <unk>, and <unk> the wrong <unk>.
So this is the first effect. The second is that even if we can <unk> <unk> and make a choice, at the end, we're less <unk> by the <unk> of how you <unk> states with <unk>.
And that's for several reasons.
One of them is that with a lot of <unk> between which, if you take one and it's not perfect, it, it's easy to imagine that they could make a different choice that would have been better. And what happens is that the <unk> <unk> <unk> us to <unk> the <unk> decision,
And even when it was a <unk> decision.
The more choices there are, the easier is to <unk> of any <unk> that is <unk> of choice.
And also, there is what <unk> call.
Dan <unk> has <unk> very well <unk> like the value that we give things that we give things to things with.
<unk> else, when there's a lot of <unk> possible, it's easy to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and <unk> to be less than the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> that is choice.
Here's an example. I'm going to leave with all those that are not in New York.
But that's what we probably knew.
There's this <unk> to the <unk>.
A place of <unk>.
<unk> <unk>. <unk> day. It's all about them.
I don't know anything. But what he thinks he's, "Well, <unk>, it's <unk>."
"All my <unk> <unk> are away."
"<unk> <unk> right in front of the home."
And it goes two weeks, I'm going to go to -- every day -- the possibility of <unk> where it wants.
<unk> <unk> <unk> for what we have, even when the choice was <unk>.
And the more are the <unk> that we have from <unk>, the more <unk> you can <unk> against how <unk>.
Here's another example.
This <unk> tells us a lot of things.
It's about to live the moment, and maybe it's going to be slowly.
But the most important point is that anything you want, you know, you're going to try to not do other.
The things that don't know many <unk> that can make less <unk> what we do.
<unk> point: <unk> <unk> <unk>.
I tried it on my skin <unk> a new couple of <unk>.
It's almost always <unk>.
Once the <unk> were just one guy, <unk> them and <unk> <unk>, and they were <unk>, only after <unk> <unk> a <unk>, and they were only after <unk> a <unk> <unk>, and they were <unk>, just after <unk> <unk> a life and lots of a lot of times, I was going well.
So, I went to <unk> a couple of when the <unk>, went, and I said, "I need a couple of <unk>, this is my <unk>."
And the <unk> said, "Do you want to <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>?"
Do you want them to <unk> or <unk>? "<unk>" or "<unk>"?
"Do them want to <unk>?"
"<unk> <unk> them wants to <unk> or <unk>? <unk> <unk> <unk>..." <unk> to <unk>.
I was <unk>, and after a little bit I was able to say, "I want the <unk> guy who was the only guy." He didn't know what it was, like, for an hour, I <unk> all of <unk> <unk>, and then I <unk> out of the <unk>, <unk>, with the best <unk> I ever had.
It was the <unk>. With all that choice I had <unk> the best.
But it <unk> me.
Why? I've got a whole book to <unk>.
The reason I was worse with all that choice my <unk> were <unk>, the <unk> <unk> to be <unk>.
I had <unk> <unk>. I didn't know anything about <unk> when I just had one guy, but when I had 100 different, it would have to be perfect.
What I'd <unk> was good, but not perfect.
After I <unk> that I <unk> with what I was <unk> in <unk> to <unk>.
The <unk> of <unk> in the lives of people's <unk> that they <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> themselves.
And this <unk> <unk>, even when the results are good.
<unk> in the world of <unk> if you realize it.
Because if I <unk> it, I don't know what I'm talking about.
The <unk> truth is more to that.
"<unk> was better when you was worse." The reason why you know, you know, when you're worse, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, "<unk> <unk>."
<unk>, in the world that we live in -- <unk>, <unk> citizens with the <unk> of <unk> -- the <unk> that we can <unk> is that things are <unk> to the <unk>.
You never have ever been <unk> <unk> because your <unk>, my <unk>, <unk>.
The <unk> of happiness -- what you're here -- is, "<unk> <unk>" Yes, "you want it to do that."
I mean -- small moment <unk> -- that I'm really <unk> and my wife is very <unk>.
I couldn't do better, I couldn't <unk>.
But <unk> don't always <unk> a <unk> thing.
You know, a <unk> of <unk> <unk> when there's just that kind of <unk> is that when you're not <unk>, and you say, "Why?"
"Who is <unk>?" The answer is <unk>.
The world is <unk>. What could do I do?
When there are hundreds of <unk>, and you'll take one <unk>, and you'll <unk> to the who is the <unk>, it's clear that the <unk> you are.
They could do better.
There are not <unk> available, there are no <unk> for <unk>.
So when people make decisions, even if the result is <unk>, they <unk> and they give them to themselves.
In the last few years, <unk> is <unk> in the <unk> world.
I think a <unk> <unk> -- not the only, but important -- of this <unk> of <unk> is that people have experiences because <unk> are too <unk>.
And when they have to <unk> this situation they think that <unk> is them.
So the end result is that in general we're better, we're going to <unk>, but we'll get worse.
Let me show you.
This is the <unk> <unk>, what we're going to take for it and it's completely <unk>. It's not true.
There's no <unk> that a little bit of choice is better than <unk> at all, but from this is not going to be a lot of choice is better than a little bit.
There's a <unk> value, <unk>. I don't know what it is.
But I'm quite sure we've been <unk> by a piece of the level where the choices are <unk> our lives.
Now, from the <unk>'s <unk> -- I almost finished -- from the <unk>'s point of view, the <unk> is the <unk>.
What it allows all that choice to <unk> society is the <unk> material.
There are many places in the world, and you'll be <unk> <unk>, where the problem is not that they have <unk> choice.
The problem is they have too much of it.
So the <unk> I'm talking about is a <unk> <unk> of <unk>, <unk> society.
And what <unk> does and <unk> is this: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> you yesterday of how much those <unk> and <unk> <unk> to <unk> are <unk>. It's a <unk> of money.
I mean, these choices, <unk> and <unk>, is not that they're just <unk>.
I'm <unk> <unk>.
They do worse.
If a little bit of what we would make choice choice to be <unk> in those where people have too few possibilities, it would not be their lives, but also <unk> our own life.
This is what <unk> call. They call a <unk> <unk>.
A <unk> of income is good at all -- not just the poor -- because of that choice in <unk> that we <unk>.
So, just to end: "<unk>, you can become everything you want to be,"...
<unk>, people of culture, <unk>, "What do that fish do that?"
"It's <unk> that you can't make anything in a <unk> of glass."
"A <unk> imagination, a <unk> vision of the world --"
and I <unk> it like this, at the beginning.
But then, I realized that that fish knows the long time.
Because the reality is that if you <unk> the <unk>, so that "everything is possible," you can't <unk> the freedom. You <unk> the <unk>.
If you <unk> the <unk> so you can <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> possible to <unk>.
<unk> the <unk>, and you <unk> the <unk>.
Everybody needs a <unk>.
This is almost certainly too <unk>, maybe even for the fish, and certainly for us.
But the <unk> of some <unk> <unk> is a <unk> for <unk> and, <unk>, for <unk>.
Thank you very much.
