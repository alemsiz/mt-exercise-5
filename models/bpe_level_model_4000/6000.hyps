The last year, I showed these these diawards to show you that the hots of the nartice, which is almost about three million years of the 48 percent, in the continents, the continents, it's the 40s.
But the same thing that is the same thing of the problem because not shows you the water.
The sot-glorial harty is, in a sense, the custer system system system system system system system system system.
You go and sanding and you get the saving of the est.
The next deather is going to be a long long as a little bit of the last 25 years.
The watching it in the argued in the red reached in the around.
As you see, you see the blue blue blue of the blue of the blue of the blue of the blue of the blue of the sand.
That's the water, in the indicate in the end of the exest.
You can see that the cool, five years of five years or five years or five years of the switches here here here here here here from the corner.
In 25 years later is going to be in this thing.
This is a problem because the rescale of the ocean intailed around the ocean is a lot of carbon of the ocean an uncelement, they are transformed by the microbiooxic bi.
And I think about the totallow of the atmosphere from the global warming of the global warming, the most of this is going to be the extend to be remarket this is not going to be there.
In some sushing in the Alaska a mile of the water.
The professentially Katey Westerer Westerday of the CAleka a a Plele--scale -- I was a very much.
Vide: Wow! Gor: Look is not going to be going to be able to be able to us.
A reason is that this made. A proper-scale scale of the normal of the north.
This is a flist of the glacific real.
The sleeping had never reached to the million people.
This is the Kangerlusssssssslow-a-bodies of Groens
If you want to know how to do the mile of the water of the saves on the saves of the smare.
These are going to be reflecting it very quickly.
Delels of the planet, the largest of the planet.
The last last scientists have scientists have scientists have been in the big, and the Anynnine of the Antunes of the Anty of the sleep, which is participate the psynthology of the folerery of the folerery of the bottom of the saves of the sous.
Every very six feet of the water, as Grows.
South Himalaya, the third largest of the most blocking, you see new saghes, who are the boars.
The 45 percent of the world's propering of the water water from the water from the flexid.
Sulle Anym: This is the bottom of this citive of this citive of this citize.
The slow-reached is going to be slowed.
So when I didimine it will happen.
In California on on the Your U.N. N.
The suses are in the crisis.
The previsions, how you have a good good good for me.
The growth of course, in the world to a nine in the world of the remarkable of the saving of the saving of the savails.
The environmental environmental environmental environmental environments are increasing from the normal and without ceds.
Somef you have more numbers in the last 30 years of preceds.
This is a sand-and-insustainable of the initive.
If you look at the contest, you look at the context of the concerned about it.
In the last five years we've add 70 million of the CO2 million of the ocean -- 25 million of the oceans in the oceans in the oceans every day.
Look at the area of the Pacactical area of the Ammest, and on the Ammmming the continent of the continent of the continent in the oceans.
The more of the right, in the depresent of the depresent of the depress is the 20th of the debes of the debe.
The oil, and the carbon is a problem, and the list of the worst of it.
The United States are one of two countries with the Cina.
And it was going to build many other cents of the carbon on of the carbon.
But we're going to be a changing changing to be a change.
These are the projects of the last years and some of some of the last and some of the desert of the desers.
And every one of the political political political political political in our Paaaa's ideas.
The carbon and the carbon and the carbon is 250 million dollars in the last year for the carbon to program the carbon on the oxyname.
Some I remember something -- I remember something.
Very Natela, in Take -- where there was a 3.8 billion of 3.8 billion and carbon and the carbon and the carbon.
Maybe you've seen the news of the news of the nears.
This is the second big flects of the America.
It's happened in Natal.
The sategity of the industries of the industries of carbon was this:
Videide: Well Frosty is a kind of a little bit of happy and happy.
It's a sleeping here in America, and it makes our economy.
Frosty the carbon is more more than it is.
It's a good good good and the sous, and the work work work and the slow.
Al Gor: West here is great part of the West Virginia.
The largest of the largest of the mountain is Massey Coal. This is his friend.
Vide: Don Blakennight it -- Sarrry, Nancy Brow: Plelele-R-Sarrry.
Gor: So the Alleance for the Clian Clian has been two miled two miles.
This is a of a sleep.
Vide: Agor: The COLery we see the changes of the changes of the minute of our own own own own in our own own own own own experience.
For this is investority is investing a big amount of money in a big sforforce to make the audience and the decade and the decade and the decade of the carbon.
In fact, the carbon is not spore.
We think it's a lot of -- has a good good proper.
So not pretactical change the change of the change
Let me do we do us.
Vide: Agone one -- you have heard -- you heard a lot of it.
So I do it in a structure in a structure of the water of the carbon of the carbon on on the oxise of the oxid.
Straordinary machin! The machine are a little bundyyes, but this is the smothers of the technology of the technology of the technology of the carbon of the carbon of the carbon of the carbon of the carbon of the botto!
The carbon is between the carbon is between the the rescale of the global carbon technology of the technology of the technology that you can see everything everything you see everything everything everything you can see all all the change.
Daaa: This is the odierery technology of the water of the water of the water of the light.
Al Gor: Instead, the alternative degrees to the economic of the economic of the economic of the community of the community.
Vide: South America is in America is in the crisi; the economic of the crisis, the crisis.
The films that the same thing that the couurage of the coffee of the carbon and the carbon and the oil.
Now, there's a new new new sleep, and ushes.
In fact, it is 100 percent of the energy of the 10 years.
A lot of the mission to the work of the most good good good to help the remarkable to help the global global warming the global global warming.
Finally, a solution that basts to solve our problems.
Aggain. Scover you more than it.
Al Gor: This is the ultimate of it.
Vide: South God: It's about America.
One of the ways we were more about the end of the dependence of the planet.
Satur: The future is here. Vento, a new energy, a new energy.
Des: Nuoven investment for different different people for different different work for different different work for the work of work for the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the people of the work of the people for different different different of the people of work for different work of the work of the places of work for different things.
South America. It's time to be time to be a time of be true.
Al Gor: A old old old properly redyying, "If you want to go to go to the solar of the solar of the solar proper.
If you want to go back to the back toge."
We need to go back to the very quickly.
Thank you very much.
The last last last last last last 10 10 to the LHC.
And promiles to reach to the machine to get to the machine.
So I think it for the other time for those of the other time you don't have no longer experiment. And the largest experiment. And 27 feet -- 27 feet.
The smote is to reach the reaction that were present to a billion times a billion times we were going to be the beginning of the beginning of a second.
All of course, is simple.
This is the machine in Gindous.
Fotography these and Big Bang Bang in the remains.
This is what I work on the ATLAS -- it's a 14 feet and has a diamong 22 feet.
This is a picture of the ATATAAS in building so you can see the proportions.
The 10 of the last last year, we have accesest in the first time we were going to be the first time.
And this picture was just just by ATLATS.
It was because of immen, you get in the saving of the saving of the saving of the slow-reaching reaching of the sest.
It's a picture of the first of particles that had done all the LLLLLLLLLLLLC, and dedededemonth in the H, and the remarket of the H, and the reverator.
In other words, when I see that the 10 Actube, we understand that the machine is a big big lived that is a big big brain.
I don't know if it was going to do it more opposition, when somebody went to Google and the vide that the pay was this:
What we had a impact of the scientific impact of what scientific scientific des.
Again, a week of a problem with the machine, I had to have to these films here -- these films -- these films -- these films are there.
These films are 13,000 feet when the machine works to the camera of the potential of the potential of the potential we could get 13,000 feet.
Now, the technical philost of you look at the movie and said, "It's not the good good good ar."
And instead of it because they are very much frequency the courage of the conditions.
So, in 277, 277, in the entire temperature of the space, these films can get that the same films can get that they can get that that they can get that that they can get that that they can get that that the ruse.
In one of the most of the most of the most of the LC, there was a difer of the LC, there was a diflight.
So the films have to rescale the 13,000 3,000 feet of the saving of a resistance of electricicics.
This was the result.
Now, this is more more expresent if you think about 20 miles that these magnetries are more than 20 cents of about 30 cents of about 30 centimetris.
It's the worst century of about 50 magnets.
We had to get them to the thing that we did it it out.
We have repristed and and revolutions.
Now, I'm going to be ornest to all the right right right now.
I was the end of the LLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL.
And we accee, and we think about the data of the data to get the same way to get it so our own own and continue to find what the morning, and continue to find what the universe.
Now, of course, in a way, these things in the same objects of the value of the value of the value of the evolution of the Serererery of the conduct.
I think that the fact that it is difficult to go to the same thing, I think this is the value of things like LC.
I want to end with the parts of a scientist, Humb, the Salalaly, the quality of his own own own experiments of his sweight experiments of his smart and the Michael was the Michael was the "Nichi," and he said, "Naay, and the human nature of the ideas that are not the same thing that are not going to be the new ide."
Thank you.
I want to start to start to think about a kids, you can look at the morning, you get the morning.
And you understand how to get them as to get them and make them and make them and suse, you see it in the space, and to think about and solve the spaces of space.
The reason is to the space, it's provided to understand the world around the world around us.
So, by the insector, the experiments of the experimentation with the objects with the conversation of my conversation and my collaborative conversation of my mothers, I started to ask you a computer, I started a computer, I started a computer, and I was just a computer, and I just just just just a little bit of the savailable to the saving of the slexiive and the same thing that you can look at the watch of the bottom of the h-
and the system?
The question was so interesting I decided to exploring the risk of the Sifttable.
In fact, a Sifttable is a computer interactive as a bibiooo.
In fact, a Sifttable is a computer interactive as a bibiooo.
You can look at the way you can see with the hour our house, you know, you know, a radio and have a radio and a radio radio and a radio radio in the sought to the savailable and a radio in the bottom of them to the house.
But it turns out of course, I'm going to look at the morning, you can get to the walk in the morning, you can look at the bottom of the around.
The South of the example of a new ide-new cities of the information of the digital information of the digital information of the digital information of the digital information.
And the hand the most of the most people who are the same thing to the same thing, the other hand, the hand the most people become more concerned of the same as the same as we can use them and new and different different and different and different and different and different and and different and different and different and and different and and different and the interactions, how to the grounds of the grounds of the same as the fingings, how we get them to be more
I'm going to give you some example.
This Siftable is confified to show the video, if I did it in a place in a place of the video video video video video game.
These are interactive interacactive.
If you get them to do it interestingly what they are going to be there.
If they are the circummmming and they can slow a few miles in the round.
If they are the circummmming and they can slow a few miles in the round.
They also have their linked and clinked and linline.
We realized that one of the interesting of the interaction was the interaction of the data, the way to use the data, in a flight, in a flight.
In this case, we have three South outh outh Sifest and I can use them to the slow of the water in the middle of the center, where you can get them to the military of the military of the military of the center, where you can get them to the saving of the save.
And I can use them to the color of the Craise where you get to the center of the center of the center in the center of the color of the color of the color of the color of the color the center, where you can use them to the cent.
If we are we we can reach it to a little bit of the right thing.
I'm also a good and the ability to take the language, as language, as languages and games of the people can try and see the things that you can try and see the results of the results of the results of the results of the results of the results of the lights.
Now, I'm going to --
This is a sequence of Fiboncacking with a programms.
Here we have a game of the Scarababable,
Pratically, in the South outh outh Prry, Prry, Prrically, in the South Prrry, in the Sertable, and you can look at a very good job on a flumms.
And in about 30 seconds of you get a new new remarkable to make a new way of the ability to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to get a new way of the ability to try to try to get a new way of the ability to try to try to try to try to get a new way of a new way of the ability to remarket to try to do it.
Thank you.
Here's the children came to the children came to the Middle Lab, I did it in the way I did it and I did a video.
They like to be a lot of it.
And one of the interesting things of this genive is that it's not to give you many people to get to the people in the neighbors.
You just say, "Your words of the worth of the words of what they are going to do.
Here's what we do you do it it for the people that you want to do it.
This is our neighborhood, in the death of the deaway.
In fact, it was just just a lot of the gurs.
They just morning, to the morning, for it.
Now, this is a very appreciation of a cart-interactivity.
We wanted to build a tool-in-in-in-in-in-in-laun.
It can reserable new persons in the South South South South Lifing South outh their associated and social network.
It can reserable new persons in the South South South South Lifing South outh their associated and social network.
So that's going to come out the solar soler.
Vide: The solive and it's surprise.
David Merrill: Now did a saved in the end of the end of the right right here.
Vide: The sategy of the arrate ararry.
Bel work work work work work!
So in the Siftages and you can make the interacting to interacting to interactive --
Vide: Bau!
And in the life in the story.
Vide: God!
DM: It's a story with the maintail, and can decide to the smoke.
DM: It's a story with the maintail, and can decide to the smoke.
Viririrl, Vololer:
DM: The last example I have the time I show you is one of a tool, I did to show you the camping music.
it's a tool, I did about the recently, to the camping and exeded and exploying.
The Siftable here are the slows like the bottom of the bacteria and the bactery.
Every one of these four different different different different different organizes, you can get to what we use to get to them to use.
You can insell these susts in a sequence of the conservice to your own own own it.
And the pleasure just just doing a good good good "You know, "soun."
These are actually that you can see from the live, as the reveral film.
And you take a smote to a lot of the sought to the sought to the remarket for the remarkable to the smountails.
And then we have the general general of the time and flight, which you can actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually make the interviewing of the sequence.
Let's look at how it works.
Vide: Din: The I’re going to take a cool in two South But, the system, the system, the est, the est, the estended other towards of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom.
Now I hope a line.
Vide: I hope I add the percent uses --
Vide: D: And I went to the bacteria to the bacteria I can see the effect from the liver of the live.
Vide: I can look at the whole whole sequence of the same time to a lot of the other time to a late from the other.
Vide: DM: And I try to add the bottom of the most pression.
Vide: I can reach the sequence of the sequence of "W."
So I don't have a flight, but I can't get the most longer of the longer or more corner.
And now, I finally, I can put the whole whole sequence of the Siftty Sifttle, "You know, "Fu."
Thank you.
So, as you can see that, my passion is building new interfaces and more more than the brain workers and the brains and the brains and the corporate and the corporate and the corporate and the brain.
And I had time to show you one of this one of this is a few decorning, and also some of the lab of the launch of the law.
The concept I want to put you is that is that this new generation of objects with the digital objects with the digital development that are going to be information in our world in our world in our world in our world in our world that we want to do it in our world.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the time I talk about all of you.
I'm a written of my written and I am a writer.
And I wrote the books is the most of course, is more than that, of course, of course,
It's also the friends and the one of my life.
And I don't think it can change change.
Me, I said that something about this was recently in my life and in my life in my career to reach me to the whole time with this work.
The particularly thing I was recently this biography called Mangia, Pola, Pola, Pola, Pola, Poo," the world and a lot of the world and become a good reason for a good reason and become a big world and become a big big question, and he was a very good good for the world and become a good good good good neighborborhooood.
And the result of that you are the people of the people are like if you were condition as if you were concerned as if you were concerned to it.
It is the very good -- concerned --
They do you get all of the things I said, "Don't do it not have to do more to do it more to do it more to do that?
You don't have to continue to get more life without all life without able to create a book that can be able to make a book that can you do anyone one book that can be able to do anyone one book that can be able to make it more important to be able to get more to to continue to make it more to continue to make it more life without able to make it more important to do in your life without anyone life without any?"
What can you do you can do anyone in your on?"
It's ruseful, you know it.
But it could go back to the most about 20 years ago, when I started to say that I started to say to say to say -- I was a written -- I wanted to be a very very much.
Anyway, in the same reaction of the same reaction of the reaction of the reaction of the same reaction of the same reaction of the same reaction.
And people said, "Don't do not do not the most of the success?
You don't have a million remaining the reduce of the remain?
You don't have no pay to do this stain, and the life without any life and blood and blood and blood a cut of any saves with the belels of the slexiant of the unclear?"
Canelsesees you know.
The answer -- the answer -- the answer is the answer of these questions is "Yi."
A., I have to all those things.
I always had a paint.
And I also have a lot of other things that people don't have to be to ink.
How are you and other things that you are going to be there.
Me, for how about it was going to write what I thought I would have to ask you why is why is why is you do it is why is you do it it is why I written it is why I thought I was a very good thing.
Is it it it it it is it?
It's the local that anyone to be able to be able to be able to be a work that you have to do.
But what is so much in the impropers of the saving you to get to the slow you to get to the other carries in a way that you don't have to do not nobody to do not nono?
How for example, for example, he was a engineering and not remember not just just just just to be a single time in his 40 years of the model that was asked if it it was asked if you to be engineering to be a engineering to be able to be able to be able to be a very good to be able to be a single time in his own own own own in his own own own own in his own own own in his own own own in his own own own own in the own country.
It wasn't -- that -- that was -- how do you do John, how do you do Johnn?
It doesn't work it work?
Onest, the engineers are not not not good as a group don't have no unclearly the remarkable of being being saved the repressizing the repress.
We written it enough to this remaination, and not only writers but creatives you this remarkable of being a lot of human beingly ly reduction of being remarkable to be able to be a lot of remarkable to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a lot of human generation.
And it's not going to look at the tribes of the death of the death of the death of the death of the century, they are young and often often often to your children.
And even the ones that are not the data look at the data like to be really, to be really, to be rereally, to be really, to be really, they are not the same data like to be really, they are not the same data from their own own things.
Norman Mailer, before I was the last of the last said, "OYes, I was a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a very much of the work of life.
But we don't look at the time, when we heard it because we heard these things like these things that you have completely interize and a lot of the notion that the notion that the creative that the creative and the skills and the exploying, and the end of the end of the arguy, and the end of the arguy, and the suses of the suses and the sought of the aroundation that the notion that the notion that the whole thing we
And the question I want to all the thing I want to do this is going to look at this ide?
You know, you know, this -- because you look at a centimer of the way of the remarkable to not get it for nothing to do it for any of this nothing.
I think it's going to be there.
And I think it's also and I don't see the repeeeat the next century.
I think it's better to removes our great creative creative creative creative creative to creative our lives.
And I know that I was that in my time -- I would be very dangerous -- it would be very dangerous to the same thing I was in the careful of the bottom and where I are in my career and where I are in my career.
Of -- I look at the time, I look at least I have about 40 years.
I still have about four decade in me.
And it's very likely to be a lot of the world in the world as the world as the work that I was going to be in the world in my last last last last last last last last last last last last last last last last last last last last I was going to be the last last fol.
I'm going to be all of the most most friends here -- it's likely to the most successful of my greatest in my eye.
Oh, Gespecially thought of it would be that.
You know this is the genive of thinking that I was going to start to start to start to go to the morning, and I don't want to do it.
I would continue to try to do this work that we do.
So, the question is it going to be it?
And so I said, after many reflecting a lot of work to work for work for trying to try to make a cook-cook-chcheck cook?
I had a few way to find a distance of course, in me, I write I write my favorite and my favorite and I written it to look at the last year, and I would look at the last year, and trying to look at the last time to see how to do you can see the other ideas and see the best and the best and the best and the best and the best of the most of the other things and the most of the planeters and all of the planets, and I write and I write about what the past of the
and to help people believe the people creative and reach the inerate of creative creative creative creative and creative creative and creative the inererate people to make the inererate people to make the inercust.
And that research has made to the Great the Great and Rose.
And you get because the giving and then you get back to the back and then you get back to the back back back to the slow and then you to get it in the bottom and then you get back to the saves in the bottom of the sous.
Nellelements and the Roma -- people don't look at -- people don't think that the creative creative creative to the men are the brains, right?
It was thought that the creative spirit was this spirit and that they were going to be in the men from a few miles from a few miles of the neut, for the neighborhood.
The creative creative of these didies look at the creative creative creative of creative creative creative creative creative of creative creative creative creative creative to the decade of creative creative creative to the decade of these creative creative creative creative creative creative creative creative creative creative creative of creative creative creative creative creative
Socry, very very quickly, it was a demelels of the saging sswelels from the saging of the clear.
The Rome of the same idea, but called that the spirit of the spirit of the genie.
The great deathose, because the Romanans, not thought that a gene was a very good geney.
They believe that a gene of this species of a little bit of the study that you can live in the study of a artist, a little bit like a little bit like a little bit like a little bit of the courage of the couurage of the work of the couurage and the end of that I was the model of that I work of the work of that I was working on the audience of the model of the experiment.
Each -- I was the ex--- that is the distance of what I thought -- that I was the copsychology that you are the results of your work and the results of your work work and the results of your work of your work.
And all of the people that was so that it was so doing this?
So the artists were propertating by the things of them to look at the nararcives?
If your work was a lot of except you can't take and all the mer, all of the mer, all of the geniident.
If your work work work was not all of the pture, right?
All of you know that it was your gene to be a initive to be a initive to be a initive to be a initive to be a initive to be a initive to be a initive.
And so people han intelligence in Octuitizen for very time.
Then the Rintailing and all change, and everything and everything is the great ide; we are the human human universe to be the human beings and the most of the neighbors and without the most skills that I written from the detail.
This was the principle of humans and the people started to think that the people started to think that the creative creative of the death of the death of the military of the death of the military of the human beings are in the principles.
And for the first time you get in the story, you know, I think about this is how to this or a little bit of a person with a person with the geniio.
And I have to tell you that was a big thing.
I think you can put anybody in a simple person to be like a recicipe of the bottom, the list of all the same of all the same stains and the remarkable to be a great films, and it's a great films, and the great degrees of the human beyond to be a great to be a very very much to be a great decadedededecal and the ddynames.
It's how to do anybody to have a sacking the solar solar.
And it turns and it was completely the argue and creating all these are going to be able to get on the same.
And I think it's this pression of the artists in the artists in the time.
And if this is it and I think that I think it will become the question and it is.
Can we do it different?
Mushing to make a understanding of the human relationship between humans and creative and creative creative and creative creative and creative creative to create a lot of the human and creative of the human and creative of the human and creative of the human and creative and creative and creative society.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we can't be, in the same thinking about 12 minutes.
And probably people in the audience that you would have to be sleeping me in scientific scientific on the notion of the notion of the neighborhoose of their projects.
It is not not going to tell you all about this thing.
But the question I want to you to do is -- why do you do it is -- why do you do it is -- why do you want to do it is -- why do you do it is -- why do you do it is -- why do you do it is -- why do you want to you to do it is -- why do you want to you to do it is --
Why don't think about this is the it?
Because has more more than any thing that has never heard to explain to expresent the expresent of creative creative creative process of creative creative creative creative process of creative creative creative to expressions.
A process of the process that I never had to do something -- -- -- -- -- -- I don't have to be -- not in the behaviorors.
And, in fact, you can look at a lot of worth thority.
I did this this indicated with the Ruth Ruth Ruth Ste, which was now a few years, but it was a few life and said, "Purururry, and I was a very good in the infected in the Sirgame and he was going to go back to the camppelels in the exployed from the exployed by the hold of the hit on the hit and I was a very much.
I said, "Let me as a fluory,
And I was to get it to the end of the achieving of the aaway.
And he would be going to get the back to the back of his sous.
It has one thing to have a one thing to do that I was going to get how to make how to do a morn."
And it turns out to the home and it was going to get from this bacteria didn't have to get another piece of cars and a lot of a career and a very quickly folerery and the traff, and the training and the pay of the pay of the pay of the paint.
Somebody could be enough to be enough to be enough to be and recorporate and cornal and the smountain the holine and the rotolold, and she was going to get through the argue and it would continue through the around, and he said, "Wom."
Then there were those times -- this is not going to do it -- I will never do -- there was almost almost almost even even the moments of the moment, right?
So, it was trying to the home and was trying to the end of the end of the end of the hold and it was a very good hold in the bottom that was a sleep, and then he was like that if you get the other and the airplan.
And it was the cooled by the couuuraged in his body and the transformed on the pay of the pay of the pay of the pay of the pay of the pay of the pay of the rororounded to the hit into his body and the save.
And in these cases, the end of the perfect of the perfect and remain the perfect of the first worth of the first worth of the first worth of the first worth of the first word.
So when I think it was -- it's just -- it's exactly the argument of my creative process of my creative creative creative process of my creative creative process of the creative process of the creative process of the creative process of the creative process of the creative process of the creative process of the creative process of my creative process of the creative process of the depend.
Not all the process of creating -- I'm not a concerned -- I'm not a concerned --
I'm a car, and my way of work in the same thing to do it in the same day and to work and work and work and work and savailable to work and work and get to savoid and get to the same time.
But I even even even in my head, I went to the sleep, I wanted to flight.
And I can imagine a lot of you that are going to do it.
You know, even if the work and ideas and ideas and ideas are going to be a little bit of not could be a little bit of it.
And what is this thing you do that?
And how can we look at the way to do it in the head of you don't do the smoon, that we do it to do it in the doing?
For how much much much example of the best example I have to the musician and Tom Waits, which I interviewed a lot of a day.
We were talking about this, and you know, and you know, Tom, of the life of life was the insection of the artical accounters, trying to make these species of the reminds of these species of these species of these species of these species of these species of the interigenies of these species of the implants.
But then I went to the slow of it, and a day as he was a day in the Los Angeles, it changed to be all for it.
It was going to look at it and all of this little bit of this little bit of a slodia, which is in his head-smoking, and it is a very quickly and it is the fall, and the slow and the she's going to be the hallely.
It doesn't have a piece of care, not has a very strate; it doesn't have a lot of the strat.
So I started to think this sort of the old old old of the way to get it in the way, and I said, "I'm going to get it to relexise the gased by this to be a bundnice to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get it to be able to get it to be able to be able to the slowing from this kind of the game of the slow.
I didn't do not do it and I can't do it it doesn't do it and I don't do it.
And instead of going to go in the psynthane, you know,
It was the whole process of the process and I was a completely new new thing.
And he just just the wrote and said, "You don't see that I'm going to be a leave you to do it it at your ey?"
"Ts it seems to write a gananother?
If you really want to you to get in a moment when I take a moment when I can take me to look at it.
Something I went to important anyone in the other today.
I wanted to look at the Conard Cohen."
And his process work work on this.
I don't work was the work was going to be a lot of it.
But the process, and the puseful of the saving was just just just when the genie, the genium of his genius, and he was going to be a lot of the universe that was going to be a thing that he was going to be a thing that he was not going to be a thing and it was not a very good thing and it was going to be a very good and it was going to be a little bit of the same thing that he was going to be able to be a little bit out of the plan
but it was this pecially really, this wonderful condition, a conversation of Twwer and what the exployed that it was not Tom.
So how I thought that I was a little bit of what I was working and I was working and I was going to be a found.
This idea, I was when I was written when I was a Mangia, Pola, Amamain in a of the wavation where we are working on something that we are working on something that will be a lot about something that will be a little bit about what will be the worst of the book that will be the worth of the book that will be the end of the book that will be the book in the book that will be the worth of the book that will be the worth of the wrotolold.
Not only good good worst st the worst book I written it was a book I writer.
And I started to think about this project.
But then I remember the TV and I remember the and we try to get it to the and you get it to the TV and then you get to the TV and then you get to the TV and then you get to the TV and then you get to the right and you get to the TV and you
So I went to my face in my hand-layer and I would come to the smom of a angle of the stick.
And I said, "You know, you know, "Yes, we know that if this book is not not going to be not not interviewing will be not interview?
Because as I see it all I do all the hell I don't have more than this.
So if you want to you to get your hand. You get your parts.
Okay, you don't know that I don't know that I don't know the light, not not not not the light.
I will written it write it because it's my work for my work.
And I would like to be the South I was a talk about today I was a little bit of the end of the end of the North -- the end of the North Africa -- you were the North of the North of the North of the North and muscities to the long and muscle and muscle and muscle and muscle and the sleep.
And they were always magniture because the ballers were a lot of the balls and were very very much of the sessions were very very quickly.
But every single single thing to the next next to the end of these artists become in the artists was actually actually actually actually transforming it in transform.
And I know what you know about what you will talk about the objects, I know that you have a way, a way, a lot of it.
It was like the time you have a lot of the ballery of a kind of slow-hold hold from the solar of the solar of the solar of the first time, but all the first time, but all of the savail.
And in the leaving doesn't look at the human beyond of it.
But you accaccelerate from the argued in the argued in the argument of the sous.
And when this first first time I had to the people knew what the people who were going to call it it it it with his nothing.
They were the smanaged and started to the samant, "Lah, Dr. Dr. Do."
That's God, you know it.
Curie remain -- when the Middle of the Sololold, they were this ababove this re-hand their hold and their hold and the several hyet and I still said, "Lah, you can even get in the weline in the waves in the sleep.
In Spay is a Solololol, he said, "Lah, I said, "Lah, yh, yyet, I realized -- one -- one -- one -- one of God.
And it's the great because we have to have you need.
M, the problem is the day I went to the ballery, when you get it to the next day in the morning of Martabable, and it was the next next to DDod od is not the most more.
It's just a moral detail, and it doesn't have to be more to make that you will never get more to the allow that you to get that that you can get that that that you will never get that that you can get that that you will never get to the save.
And maybe nobody will be the name of Dod of Dod and what is to do with the hold of his lives?
It's difficult to it.
This is one of the neighborhoods to do in a life in a creative life in a creative life.
But maybe not to be so to be so much of the most of the most extraordinary of the most extraordinary of your eyes are of your eyes of your eyes.
But you can just give you you the data in the way to the bottom, the end of this hospital of your life that you have to get a little bit of your life in the end of your neighborhood.
And, you know, if we think about this way we think about change.
And so I started thinking about thinking about the time I was thinking about how I thought I thought for different months in the book that was the audience of the book that was going to be the dangerous of my greatest exploying, I was the greatest delights of my greatest success.
And that I have to tell me when I was going to tell me when I don't have to do it not just just pay.
Not just the First of your work.
I was to think of your party, any of your parts, any of any of your parts.
If your work is bally, ball, I balls --
If the swwile, I wrote the cover of the orgorgans, for a very much.
Something I tried to the same in your own dance.
And "Oh, it is it to it.
I think I think I think I think it to teacher.
"Oh, even only to get it to have a local and put it and put it to reach them to get to reach you to get it to reach you to reach you to reach you to get it to reach them to get it to reach them to get it to really.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
How you know I had talked about these projects on the genome of human, what can can be and discovered and discoveries of the genomes.
We're going to start a new lost and we started a digital biologist and now now now now now are going to be a new fluid of the biologist of the biologist of the biologist of life.
We always have to try to get great questions.
"What is something that many biological are something that many biological tribes to understand the saving skills to understand the welse.
We tried different different appreciate different reducing the minims.
We're going to look at almost 20 years of the time.
When we have been the genome of the genome of the world of the world of the biogic world of the computer.
Now we do it it -- we can regenerate the new life to create life to this universe to this universe to this universe to this digital?
This is the map of a little organisms, Mycoplase, Mycople, which is the kind of the genome of the genome of the genome of the suseful of the genome of the genome of a little little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the genome of the genome of a little bit more more than the genom
And we tried to reduce the genome of creating a lot of little more little little bit more little little bit more little little bit more little little bit more little little bit more little little bit of the genome of the genome of the genome of a little ome to create a little bit more little bit more more little genome to create a little bit more more little bit more little little gen
We are able to the list center of the genes of the genes of the genes of the genes of the genes of the genes of the genes of the genes of the genes of the genes of the genes of the genes of the genes of the genes of the genes of the genes of the genes of the genes of the genes of the genes of
But when we look at the map of his mainly is relatively simple to the nonot.
I think it's simple.
But when we look at all the genes we can find out of the time, it's very much likely to get a cell cells of the cell cells.
So I decided to do that the only program to program to remarkable to be able to the way to get the way of these questions to get the fundamental of these questions to some of these questions to those questions to get these questions.
And so we started the wave, "Can we started to sleep,
It can you get the very consciousness of these great ecooos, we never have to make the first of the first time.
And, in the case we can make a mountail?
A smountain a lot of the material of the materials.
The very quickly we can be able to look at the life is growing the growth of the exponential.
Our ability to write the genetic thing is actually actually actually actually exploployees, but it's actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually very much.
And our most recently results the results of a current to exponential.
We started more than 15 years ago.
The process has asked a lot of time we start with a revision of the first experiment.
But we found that that we found the DNA is very difficult is very difficult to it.
There are decade of thousands of thousands of thousands of miles of the long century of the long century of the long 350 ads of a degenerative process is a long generative process is the long century.
So we had to developing a new metoid to remasting these frames and corporate the same time.
And this was our first property to the digital of the genome of Pololola 177.
It's a little viruses that kills kills.
We designed the light of the cramef of the revolundary and get a lot of about 5,000 literally.
The interesting interesting interesting is when we took this kind of material and we have this genetic and we have it in the bacteria started to the genetic and provide this genetic philosopsopsopsopsopsopsopsopsopsophistics.
The particles are the viruses of the cells, I'm going to go back and they have structures. They have structure.
I talked about the members of the industries of the industries of the industries that they have to be a mothers.
They rereach to the most of you.
We think this is a situation where the software actually building the same system can actually build his same system system in a biologist.
But we wanted to do things in the big thing.
We wanted to build the whole roundly the back.
I'm more than 580 miles of cocools of courage.
So we thought about the cell of the virus, so we can change the viruses of the cell for understand what the cell of a cellual cells of a cell.
The design design design is the maintail, and we start with information in a computer, in a computer, they have to be very accururate to be very accururate with the digital computers.
When we were this genome for the first time in 1995 5 the accurururing of a Pololol,
We discovery, we discovered to the first of the original of the original sequence of the original original of it will never be able to do it in it.
One of the process of the process of the long long time to get the 50 bunckey with all the other sees of 50 miles of 50 miles to build the other other hands together.
We are going to ext it.
You will be a little bit of the flist of the flist of the flight.
Thatat, we have a cocococo-co-co-co-co-called C, and T.
And you have a little bit of these guys are about 20 20 20 20 miles and there's a specific specifically remarkable to get for every minef course, for every minoxid.
So we can use the genetic propering for written thinking about it, I would be the same thinking about it.
What we did we did it at the beginning of it.
Somee was the same thing that it was not a little bit of it.
We designed these sexual remarkable to the universe with miles.
There are the imples that they make them them and they get them to the symphies.
And we started to start used to the next next to start with the five miles from five miles from five miles in the way to form the sle--mile slexive to 72 miles to save their own time to slow the literally.
Ad we have produced these sexual re-hononable to create a military that we're trying to create a provide of a provide -- how to see in a minute.
We're trying to look at the process.
So this seems a lot of a smoket.
When we look at these seges very long as much more than 100 miles don't get more to the Ecool.
You get to the limits of modern the biologist of the biologist.
So we have to look at other sticks.
We don't have a little bit of another stom, called regreen remarkation to remarkable to remarkable to reparate the DNA and reminds.
Here's a example.
This organisms, called Deinocock-cock-ray folds of the radiation.
You can see in the right, as his mountailing the mountail.
In 12 -- 24 hours is rereminated as the first was the first first was the first desert.
They are thousands of organisms of organisms that are able to do it.
These organisms can be able to be able to be able to be to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to remarket.
They can live in the sive.
I'm not not sure that life life in space, and you get new environments to find new environments of water.
And I said, NASA showed showed that this viens.
This is a picture of the molecululating of these propering these propering the list of the list of the saving of the sexugggggen of the sexuggggen of the sexic imagines.
The light, you get them to the bactertertery.
This picture is not been used with a micro-micro--micro-to-micro--micro-to-micro--micro-to-micro--micro--micro--micro---micro--to--micro---to-to-to-to-to--to-to-to-to-to-to-micro---to-to-to-to
It's a lot of the very big that big is that we can see it with a microscope with a microscope of a microbe.
These are a picture that you are a time of about six seconds.
This is the adult we did a lot of time ago.
I'm more than 580,000 cars of cocools
It's the most big of a lot of a structure of a structure of the men I was a lot of of the men
It has a lot of saving 300 million million.
If you have to save it with a career to 10 to the slow of the only to get 142 miles to reach this genetic prototyping this genetic remarkable to get this genetic proper.
Now, how do we do it work? How can we do it work?
Of course, you have a viruses is a little girls.
It's a little bit more complicated when you use the bacters.
It's simpler when it is a simple cell as the ememiiron: you can just look at the nuclear of the nuclear of the slow, which is the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the slower of the cution:
In the bacteria the mountain the mountain in the cells, but we have been able to show that we are able to do a traffic trained by a mountain a mountain a and a lot of the around.
We have a mountailing a microbial microbibig.
The two different of the men are the bound.
We add some gene in the way to decide that we could decide that you can get this to the mountail.
The only only only only with the insectors in the way to get all the protects of the protects of the protects of the clear.
And when we put in in the cell cells -- and you get our graduate to our graphic graphic grastics, the new mountain the mountain the cell.
And we started thinking we were not going to go to go to the most more in the most in the most most in the most slings.
This is one of the most mantural evolution.
We found that that we discovered a second second or a second second or a third of a second of a couple of a second of a second of new new new new dimensions of the species.
So the evolution of how to evolution as a gene of the time you have not realized that it doesn't understand the biologist of the biologist of the biologist of the biologist of the biologist of the biologist of the biologist of the biologist of the biologist of the bia.
They are the constants, called the reference of reference is that I adultures,
The mountain that was in the cells of it.
The cells of the hold of the hold we have inserable to the hit it is.
And it's express, and he recognizing the other mountail, the sleep, and we are all the mastics, and we are all all the mountail.
It become blue blue because of the genes we have insert.
And in a very short of time, all the cars of a species of a species of a special species, and it's transformed on the new species, and it's transformed in the new software going to be in the cell cell in the cell phone of the mothers of the mothers of the mothers of the model we were going to be transformed in the new software in the new new species,
All the political organisms are changed, the members are changing the genetic thing that we are going to be the genetic of what we are transformed.
Now, this could look at the genetic genetic software the software going to change the things in a lot of the things in a lot of the things of the things in a lot of the software in very good things in a lot of the software going to change the software going to change the software going to change the software in a lot of the software in a lot of the software in the software in the software in the software
Now, I have already express here is not talking about the provide of three million years and a half of evolution, and I said, "We're going to create a new new new new flexision of the explosion of the design of the digital process of the digital process of the digital process of the digital process of the digital process of the digital of the maining of the genies of the planet.
Why do you do that?
I think it's pretty good when we think about our need to necessary.
We're going to spend to six billion people and a half of people in the next year in the next year in the next year in the next year in the next billion years.
Just to give you a example: I was nice in 1946.
Now, there's three people on the planet, in 1946; in 1946; in the 194, in 194;
We're going to find it in the bottom and the water and the slums, and the beline of people.
It's still more than we will do it for a billion dollars a billion billion time.
Up more than five billion bundance, more than 30 billion bars of the olid.
That means a million bars of bars in the day.
When we try to find out of the biological process of the kind of process to be a challenge to be a challenge of a challenge of a huge challenge.
And in the most we realized of the CO2 from CO2 from these materials that you are in the atmosphere.
In the scientific day, thanks of the scientific world, we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I like to think about 20 million genes, and I think think are the future.
The industries of electronic ic muscle of the things are going to think about the things are different things are founds.
Our are here here are data here are data and the biological imagination.
Now we have a lot of these metothank you to create what we can make what we call it what we call the genomic genomic genomic phic philosopicicics.
We are able to build a big robots that can build a million million dollars a million the day.
Think of these 20 million genes of the different or different or to try to try to try to try to make it into the provide and make a little bit more to make a little bit more theam, and create a little bit more about 20 years of fast ast of the last 20 years of science.
And it's just a sexual remarkable to the remarket of the less.
We can ssssssssssslow-producing producing producing producing producing the savetc.
This is an ananean anean experiments on that we're working on that we're working for a lot of the computer.
Well, we don't necessarily know how you will be going to be it.
We know exactly the genetic thing is the genetic thing is to the genetic thing is the genetic thing that they know exactly the genetic thing is their cococote.
We're going to be able on the carbon of the carbon of the generation.
You also see that you can see that you can see it was a experiment was a experiment to the end of the game experiment was a experimimate experiment.
We have a lot of the second generation that ushhed enough to the carbon of the most of the most valuable of the most valuable of the most valuable of the different different kinds of suse.
But the only way that the biologist of the most impact of the cool, the cover of the food and reaching the food and remarkable to transforming the mission to the first of the first time we work to design this to design that we work to get this to the first of the first generation of the first generation of the first generation of the degrees in the same generation of the death of the same generation of the skills of the souththths of the planes of the sououble and the first to be able to be able to be be able
The light of the CO2 is a military metoxithoxies.
This is a organism we have to decade in 1996.
The ocean an expressure about 2500 feet to the temperature of the water.
They believe that C2 2 E2 EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE2
We're trying to understand if we can see if we can save the CO2, which can be able to be transformed by the CO2 in the CO2 in the ground for this process.
So I was a lot of we could be able to be able to be able to be able to the question of "What the vita" is not the Not -- we have the same decal of the entire industries of the entire industries of the industries of the industry of the industries of the industries of the folicherererer's neighborhooood.
Every you can't do it it it doesn't do it to TED, where you do it it is.
It would be a main the maintail.
I’m working for the same way to use the same metothoks to create a vaccines to create a vaccines for the anetheeanes.
You saw this year with the same year with the end of a year and with a year and a dollar, you can find the vaccine in the right right right right now.
I think that it can change in the anticians.
Here's how the future could start start to be changing changing, the evolution, the evolution, the evolution of the evolution of the evolution of the evolution of the evolution of the savailable to the savailable to the savailable to the savies.
We are so so much of the best people.
Our exploploiting to do in the long long long to try to do it for you very much.
First of all you will see the most important thing that we have a lot of technology that we have to the Microrororoty in a water, I was a year in a year is a year in the Micrororororounon.
It's a environment, which you can interactive is to the cell of the remotion of the data of the data of the data of the data of the data of the data of the data of the data of the data of the data of the data of the degree of the data of the degree of the lights.
Here we're seeing very very much of the digital of a digital picture of a little bit of a lot of a lot of a very quickly folid, and you can see the images of the images of the images of the images of the digital images of a very much.
And not important as much as much of information information that we see how we are great these things that are great these data or the images of the data or images.
Most of the photographs of the digital photograph, but this is a scantural res, and rereached by the Big of the Big of the games of 300 mix.
It doesn't do any difference because the only thing that the only thing that is the number of a system of a lot of the pixide in any moment. It's also an architectural thing. It's also a very flict.
This is a book of example of data doesn't images.
This is Casa Sasa Sasa Cickens. Easts. East.
For you show you that is just to show you that it's not going to see a thing of the generation, to see that it is a representation of a flight, not a flight.
It could be a little bit of a little bit of a book to read a book a book to a book a book to be a book to be a book to be a book to be a book to read a book to a book a book to be a book to be a book to be a book to be a little bit of a book to be a book to be a book to be a book to a book a book to be a book to be a little bit of a book
Not it it doesn't do it it again.
This is a more example of the most important. You know, it's a number of the Lardian an ardian example of the Lardian example of the Lardian.
Every very big is the beginning of a see.
And you really want to be the beautiful experience of a very flight, you can get the version of a reacea a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a very flight.
We also did something with the angle of this number of this number of this number of the Lardian ardian ardian ardian ardian unan.
We created a smarine resolve to solve the other other, much more more than that you are in a normal normal -- and we have a very extratraordinary trained of the content of the content content of the content of the content of the content of the content of the content of the content of the content -- and you can be a very very much more than the slower of the content of the content of the slower -- and we use it in the ff
If you want to see the careful of this cell of this is going to see here.
Or other models, or other models, or the specific flifeet.
And this really shows some of these ideas to the program of the space.
We don't have to be in the end of the end of the miles and millions and million, not not to be able to be good good for the neighborhood.
Naturally, the map is a lot of of the most of technologies.
And on this is not going to tell you if we don't say that we have to say to do in this campe.
These are all the U.S. S. in the U.S. S. S.
So now we're going to do something else.
This is actually actually actually from the webs; you can see it it is.
It's a project called Photynthosyns, which is that two different technologies.
One is Seadaddon and the other thing is a very interesting interesting thing to Nah Snnnarrote a student of the Colololeron, with the East of the US and Rick Scocouurage Microrow's Microm of Slization and Slization and Shihidden Renencouzation of the Mics.
And it's from the website of the website of the website of the website of the website of the website of the website of the web,
You can see it when we do this kind of the universe we can see it from a image of the other experience of the same experiences.
But the collose of the spaces here has actually actually actually actually a mean.
The algoritorit: The visualization of the computer images of the objects that you get to the places that the site -- all the smothers -- all the EElags of the Rococty -- all of the Rococtages -- you see the Rocock -- you see the argue of the selements of the argues of the artical and the same thing to the same thing to the date.
I don't know if I don't think about you will show you some other environment.
There are a lot of the most space.
I want to get to one of the same data data -- and this is to show you what it is from a precedy of Photoyns that we did it for the first time we did it to show you what the first time you will show you what the first is the way to show you what the technology is really the Posyynal technology is not just to the hototelelel. And it is the Internet.
We had to do it it and I got to tell you that you are going to tell you that you are going to be able to get it to it.
This is a revolution, the Cototh of Notototo's a Bast, Bast, Bast, Bast, and you get images in the maining of the camps, other of the camps, other of the camps, other images of these are going to be a little bit of these are in the images of these images of the maining of this is a maining and the model of this model.
So I'm all the images of Flicken and I'm going to be all the space, in this moon.

Basts think that the scious of the Saguards of the Vy Lack, or the Vicica, which is the savailable of the saves of a sense of a smarine and the respirits are still going to respide the Daaa's important and the way to respide and the end of the world and the world that are the idea of the world that we are the most of the world that are just in the world in the world and the fundamental and the world of the world and the model of the whole whole thing that we are are the the the world and the world and the the the world the world the reality of the reality of the ararararararar
The consequence of a particularly of a particular choices that our stirs has done it for a lot of generations ago.
And, of course, we are the true of course, we are going to be expensive.
All of the fundamentally we do it.

We talk about it.
You will be a true thing that you want to say not to talk about the language.

And this for different reasons.
One of these is that with the lot of the saves that you can get a different choice and it's not perfect, it's very easy to imagines that you could do a difference that would be better than that is the best thing that is that the most important thing that it would be better than the nurry, and the slexive and the slexumine of the delights, and the degrees of the decade of the press of the decide of these is not not going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the flililililililililililililili

I was a little bit of the hold I would say, "I want to say, "I want to the only only only only one of what was the only of what was a lot of what I was going to get all the Banans, I went to the Sepepep, with the best sous, with the best of the jutans I had a couple of suseful and I had been done in the dayyet.
It was the simply of the choice I had to get the meet.
But I would feel worse to it.
Why? I wrote a book for understand it.
The reason I was worst of the same worst is that with all the choice were soubbe, the good choices were perfecected.
And I went to the beginning of them didn't know nothing about it. But when there was only a lot of 100 of 100 of 100 different different places, even even though I had to be perfect a lot of a perfect.
What I had watched it was good good at it.

But it doesn't always get not to be not a good thing.
I finally, a consequence of the sweaans of the Seans of when there's only that kind of jeans is that when there's not good arguy, you ask you you you ask you to you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you can do you do you do you do it in the doing?"
