The year I showed these positive positive to show that the calculate that the calculate glacial artical size 48 million years has had the 48 percent of the 48 percent of the 48 percent.
This is the gravy of the gravity of the problem because it doesn't show it the lacia.
The calculate arty is in a sense, the cubor sense, the cubor cucuber system.
It turns out and the inveral and they get the expand.
The next deasic promise is a rapid of the rest 25 years.
The gay gain in the rect.
As you see, you can see the blue blue blue to the blue blue blue to the blue blue blue blue to the blue blue blue blue to the blue blue blue to the blue blue blue blu
This is the lacior in invery, which is the real-hand.
You can see the cosidddriage of five years or five years or five years or more, is like the slooke, whatever is the body from the body.
In 25 years is spent on thing, like this.
This is a problem because the rescale of the very interested in the ocean to the ocean to the ocean where there are enormous fourth of carbon the floors of the bunch of microbi.

If you look at the context of the context of the consequence.
In the last five years we add 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 million tons -- 25 million tons every day.
Look at the American area of Pacific ards, from America, dradical parts of the continent, where there is a repect of the continent, where there's a radical of the ocean
The global recent global drination, together to the deforestation, which is 20, is the usual usual usual combind the resilly.
The oil is a problem, and the charbon is persece.
The United States are one of the most emissions, together to Cina.
And it was to build a lot of other central landscape of carbon the carbon to build a lot of the carbon to build a lot of other centry.
But we're assisting a change.
These are the last projects in the last few years and some of the last few years and some remarkable realternative projects of alternative projects of alternative projects of alternative projects of alternative projects of alternative projects of alternative projects of alternative projects of alternative project.
All of every political lotly political in our Paese.
The charbon and the oil industry have been expect 250 million dollars in the last year to promote the carbon the last year to promote the carbon the last year to the last year.
And this image I recovered me to something --
Natal Tennessee, where you live to the Tennese, where there was a 3.8 billion charbon of charb.
Maybe you seen it sound us.
This is the second fleft of scores in America.
It's happened to Natal.
The public natalized of a real-industries of carbon was this thing.
Video: Frosty the carbon is a kind of a kind of a and happine.
It's just a lot of the America, and it makes our economy.
Frosty carbon is more and more and more and more bird.
It's a good price, and the workers and workers are hypendent to the style and the dependent and works.

Al Gor: So the Al Gor: So the Proteation of Clim has a two campaipaign.
This is a hune of it, a party.
Video: All ll the COALerggo, we see the climate changes as a minm of our business.
So our priority is investing a great quantity of money in a public sforce to make a public and confuses the truth.
In fact, the carbon is not spore.
We think it's a good -- has a good -- has a good property.
So it doesn't precupately.
Let me do us.

Thank you very much.
The year to TED pheces on the LHC.
And I promise to get to to add to get the machine.
So the other time -- the other time that the other time that the other time -- the LHHC is the greatest experiment never tented -- 27 ask of conference.
His to recognize the conditions that were less than one billion second of a second from the beginning of the time -- to 600 million times to 600 million times a second.
And it is just environment.
This is the Gineva.
We have these mini-Big Bang Bang Bang Bid in the rilevators.
This is what I work. It's called ATLAS -- is a 44 meters and has a four hyfour in 22 meters and has a 22 meters and has a diamet.
This is a picture of ATLATLAS in building so you can see the proportion that you can see the proportions.
10 settember year, we have accese, we have accese, the first time, the first time.
And this picture was told by ATLAS.
It was a lot of immense in the heads of control.
It's a picture of the first particle of particles that all the done of the LHHC, and deliberated, deliberated, with a part of the LHC, and hard particlevel.
In other words, when we see that 10 10 settemployees the 10 10 settember that is a great life.
I don't know that if this is to do us more opening this when someone on Google and vide this was going to do this was this thing.
And it means that we had a cultural impact of what scientific scientific scientific approach.
And it was a week week with the machine, it had to these films here -- these films here -- these films here -- these films here --
These files are 13,000 ample of the massive needs of power.
Now, technical technical between you look at the film, "It's not true. They're the too much more than too much."
And instead of the why they are very fredy become cosidings of the surfactors.
So, 271 grade 2, a temperature of the space between the space between the stellow space between the stellow star stellow the corry.
In one of the most of the most emial lands in LHHC, there was a fabled fabable.
So the movies of the resister and 13,000 ample of the 13,000 ample of the electrick resistance.
This was the result.
Now, this is more impressional impressional if these magnets are more than 20 tons in the sunled of about 30 centimeters.
There's danneged about 50 magnets.
We had to love to the boat, what we did we do it.
We have repristined and add right.
And they're going to go to all their place to all their place to the ground.
Entruth, the end of the LHC is going to be new integry.
Let's access to get to the data to get data to get data or hold, and continue to be able to discovered to discovered to discovered that they excited the universe.
Now, of course, in a certain a certain the way, these gain the value of science and the science of science and the engineering of the science of frontiers.
And I think that the fact that it is so hard to go to the sunlists, I think is the value of things like LHC.
I want to conclude with the words of one scientists in the English, Humpheasy, which is a fespecially inuses to the inuses of his crazy was Michael Faraday, disse: "No is so dangerous for the progress of human minds of human minds of human minds of human bedds, who who are are the mind of the money, and that they don't be able to be able to be able to be able to nature,
Thank you.
I want to start ask to reward you to get here, children, children, play with the characters.
And as you understand how to do you get them and fears and mother momother and momother motion, learn and resolve problems and resolve problems and hands the relationships and relationships to the relationship.
The space is property connected to the way we understand the way we understand the world part of the world in us.
So, by informatical informed by usual objects with the objects of our interaction with my consult -- and my consult Jeevan Kalanith, I started asked to ask the With of the mouse of the focus, instead of the mouse of the folded of the mouse of the flower of the rest of the rellital path of our interaction, to the information with the fourth of the framingings, and the slandless of the sland.
and system, our place of our place ace?
The question was so interesting that I decided to exploring the answers, building Siftable.
In point -- a Siftable computer is a computer interactive computer active as a birth as a found computer in the point of a bird.
In point -- a Siftable computer is a computer interactive computer active as a birth as a found computer in the point of a bird.
You can move with the hands with hands -- they can see the right and they have a and have one and they have a skill and a radio wireless.
But flight -- I'm objects, like mattones, as the mattones, you can move to simply it to be able to make it just to be able to move it.
The Siftable of a new ecourage system.
And they get more physics, consciouss, consciouss, consciouss, and the mand they must be more than they become more than the floors, of the other ways of the other people of the other people of the other texploring new stily and different and different stily and different stily and different stily of the interaction.
And he started with some simple example.
This Siftable is configurated to show the video -- if you including the video game, the video rooter.
These are the interacactive interactive of the other.
If they do them in the face thing is their intor.
If they are surprised and they can get a little bit of a po.
If they are surprised and they can get a little bit of a po.
They also really have their movement and including the less.
And then we realize that one of the interaction of the interaction was the power of the interaction of the interaction of the data, a liquired.
In this case, we have three Siftable configurated as a sectest and I can use to color, where you can use to color, where you can use to color.
and I can use them to color, where you can use to color, where you matter property.
If we can true, we can get a little bit of place.
There's a lot of approach to appear that is the language, as the languages where people can try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to make things things like to see the results.
Now I'm --
This is a Fibonacus that I do with a program of equations.
And we have a play words that is in Scarabeo and Bogge.
Pratically, to every pursue a line on every Siftable, Pratically, in every Siftable, Praticically, to every Siftable, and he certainly sunling on a hands of a detectionaries.
Then, after about 30 second remilar new set of a new set of lectly and new chance to be able to try to make a new set of them.
Thank you.
Here's the children came in Lab, I did in Lab, I did it in the Middle and I gave a video.
They have lot.
And one of the things of this gene application is that you don't give you a lot of people to give people a lot of people who are instruments.
And I just said, "Wole," and they were sleep, and they will be exactly what do this.
Here's the other people who triggling it.
This is our best head, there is described to the road.
It was just implant.
They just were just furns, for him.
Now, this is an interactive apply of a interactive interactive interactive apply.
We wanted to make one tools a tools of languages of language.
It can inserve new choice, in the scene, and they were all the Siftable to their associated associated ated to their associated ated ated Siftable to their Siftable to their Siftable to their Siftable to their Sifts.
It can inserve new choice, in the scene, and they were all the Siftable to their associated associated ated to their associated ated ated Siftable to their Siftable to their Siftable to their Siftable to their Sifts.
And it is doing the solution to the solve sole.
Video: She's source.
David Merrill: One has a treatment in the scen.
Video: The treator --
Bel work!
So school Siftable school and put the neighborhoods --
Video: Bau!
-- it is to the story.
Video: Cia!
DM: It's a story with engine, and it can decide as you spread.
DM: It's a story with engine, and it can decide as you spread.
Video: Video: I live on.
DM: The last example of the time showing is one tool, to be a recently, to putting music.
and it's a tool, recently, to recently, to field and exeffort music.
The Siftable to the sky skills like the basic and the batteria.
Each of these different variations, and you can go to the variations, and you can use what us.
And then you get these sound in a sequence from a sequence from a comport or pattern to your food or pattern in a sequence.
And it just just to make a simply to make a "such a "such of a sequence."
These are effects that you can control from the live and the film.
And then you get to a particular and then including and then including it.
And then there are the general effects as time and they wanted to be the intersequence.
Look at how it works.
Video: DM: We emember a base in two Siftable Sift," we are system, we are system, we are system, we get the other basice.
Now a bassroad.
Video: DM: One of the top of the use;
Video: And then I put the filtrum to the batteria, so I can control the effect of the fact that the face of it.
Video: DM: I know the interest sequence the intersequence of a time from a late to the other one from the other.
Video: I'm going to add the movie film to draw the based to drive the basic film.
Video: DM: I can recombinate the sequence of the flight to the sequence.
So I don't like to do the first time, but I can try to make it more longer or more more than the most longer or more corted.
And finally, I can get the interact to the interinteract to the intersequence, the Siftable to the Sifttable to the Sift."
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is build new interface that managed to the other machines as our brain and the body body body is going to work our brain and body.
And today, I had time to show you one of this result of this percord of this percord of this percords.
The conct that I want to transmit is that this new generation of objects projects to interact with the media digital degital with the media digital world's way to do.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the one of all of you.
They're a write write.
Sclimbs is my professional is more than this, but it's more than this is more than this, of course,
It's also love and the love and the fashed of my life.
And I don't expect that can change it.
But he said, something about this is going to be success to the whole life and my life, and my careera, who has to recognize the entire reported with this work.
The particularly thing I recently recently this book, this book, this biography called "Mangia, Ama" the quality of my precedents to some of the price of the reach of the world and became a big connectional connectional connectional world.
And the result is that everyone from the hor, people are treated.
Davy -- condence, condence.
They are all worried and saying, and saying, "You don't have pursue to do it more than to do it as a children.
You don't have to keep write to write all of life without more power to create a book's living a book?"
that can important someone to the tell?
It's rasically, you know.
But it may go to the one one of what I remember the most 20 years ago, when I started to say to the people -- I was a adolescent -- I wanted to be a write.
I met the same reaction of the reaction from the country.
And people said, "I don't know the time I couldn't have to be success?
You don't have pursue the birth of the rified by kid?
You don't have to do this mestiate to do this mestiate life, the life without of the horse of the hort of a heart clear class of the lock of the climbing energy of falliment?"
So you know.
The answer -- the short of all these questions is, "Si."
I was in all of all of all of those things.
I always had country.
And I also have count many other things that people may not ine.
As and other things of, and other things of.
But how to do it about the write I thought and I asked me and I asked me because it is it because it is, why it is, why it is, why it is it?
Is it?
It's logical that everyone deba lot of being spect to be often by a work that has to do this.
But what is that particular in the imprese creative to make us to make us to the reality to the reality in a way that other charen't you do not do it?
How my father was a engineer and it was a engineer and I don't remember one time in his 40 years of the time in the 40 years of the activity that was asked to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be able to be able to be able to engineer to be able to the patient.
And it was that that block of the engineer John, as well.
It didn't work?
Enestly, the engineers like group as group as group as group of the seeum of being alcouraged the reputation of being alcouraged in the several reputation of the reputation of the reputation of the reputation of the reputation of the reputation of the reputation of the reputation of the reputation of the reputation of the reputation of the reput
We have a reputation, we have this reputation, and not only a reputting and creative creative of every generally instable to be enormous instable.
And not the other thing that look at the triste of the mormores of the death of the death of the death of the death see, they were four and often to the bunch of the death of the death of the death of the death of the death of the death of the moref of the death of the death of the death of the death of the death of the death of the mor
And the people who don't have to be really, they seemed to be really, they were done of their woms.
Norman Mailer, before the last view in the last view was the very point of my booken has killed a little bit more more extraordinary to the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the entire of the rest of the review of the original works.
But we don't know how much the way we heard that we heard these things that are very long as a long way we have these things that a lot of the ustion that creative notion and recognize that the creative and soffering the nurses that art.
And the question I want to bring all of the today is that you do with this ide?
It was the bones that -- because it looks like a centimeter of distance to me not this one one of this suppose.
I think it's odiose.
And I think it's dangerous and I don't want to see the next secolor sease.
And I think it's better to the great mind our great minds.
And I know that in my house -- in my house -- it would be very dangerous to the situation of the expensive to the circumstances that are in my house and where they're in my careera.
Of course, it's a younger -- I was young young young, I have about 40 years.
I still have about four decar decar decar decar in me.
And it's very probably probably what it was going to written from the world as the world as the world as the world as a work that used to be able to the last book.
I'm going to be slave, because we all have more friends here -- it's probably the most success is the middle of the midddle of the midddle of the middle of the most of the sun.
Oh, Gese, you think about it.
You know this is the gene of thinking about a person to a person, to start to get to the basive and I don't want to do it.
I will continue to do this work that we do.
So, the question become to the question of that?
And so I seemed after a lot of reflections, which is to try to get a couple of a psychological copsychological cook?
I have to find a distance of security between me, I am trying to write, and my natural reaction is on what I was going to be able to get E, trying to get E, trying to get the next year to do it to look at the time to look at the time to look at the time to look at the time to see if you can see if I could have the more than the banks and more sans and more santhans and more and more and more santhanks and more and the natural than the re-blood and of the next year and the react --
how to help people creative people creative to make the inerent resent emotts.
And that research has to the ancient and Roma.
And I was going to go to the hundred and then it back to the hundred back.
In the ancient and Roma and Roma -- people were not creative to believe that the creative creative manage, OK?
It was that creative that creative was about this devine and that was about the devine and that was a few people who came out of a few people and fururther distant and connected.
The creative demonis called the creative demoniors of creative creative creative demoni."
Socrate, she created to have a demon that had a demon that sage.
The Rombers were the same idea, but they were called the record without a genie.
The thing is great, because Romans didn't think that a genie was somebody else was a smart.
They have a gene gene gene of exity to the kind of excited in the murch, a little bit of the study of a study of a little like the elfor of a little bit like the nassister of the work of the argument and modeling the result of work.
Exial -- except -- that is the distance of what the psychological psychological psychological results of your work.
And everybody working, they were so that it work?
So the argus were protected by certain things, like for example, like to example, us?
If your work was exceptional work was exception, all all the market, all of the market, all of the market.
If your work is not all of the fally, not all of your fally.
All of all of the gene that was your gene to be a incapace.
And so people concept the creative creative creative in Occident for a long time.
And then the Rinascient Rinasciate and all of this great idea; we put this great idea; we have the human human beyond the center and sless to the grow of the creature of the creature that they written from the growriter from the greater of the greater of the great idea;
This was the main human eximent and people start thinking that creative and people start thinking that creative creative creative from the ished by the ishare.
And the first time in history, you get this is that I referred this or gene as a gene genie to a gene with genie.
And I have to dively, I think was a big error.
And I think about somebody to create somebody to create somebody to be like a recible as a foundly and the source of all the misters, creative and connected to the fragible and inconnect a responsibility to a mother on a movies a mother to the fragile of the fragible to create the fragile and the fragile of all of the mysterd.
It's like to ask somebody of enginoid the sole.
Deform and destory and creates all these engineer and creates all these expectative on the performance.
And I think this was destructed to the art around.
And if this is true, and I think that is the question.
And we can do this different?
Magary to a more antics of the relationships of humans and creative creative human relationship.
Or maybe it make.
Maybe we can't cancells we can't be 500 years of though, in a talk about 18 minutes.
And probably there is people between the public that would be able to the nice scientific needs on the notion of the notion of the neighborhoods, that they following their projects.
It probably don't you know about this thing.
But the question I want to bring is -- why us?
Why don't think about this modo?
Because it has more sense of every other thing that has ever heard to explane the explane of the process.
A process that is that one that has ever been able to do something -- so foundly, all of this -- you don't understand the sket.
And, in fact, it can seems to be completely paranormal words.
I did this recently with the extraordinary extraordinary poet, who has 90 years, but that was a poet for all of life and he said that the life and said, he was a few of his life and said, he working out in the pursue of the pursue of the extraordinary country, and I was going to go out of the countruth, and I was the country, and I was the country.
He told he was like a fragot of aria.
And that was going to come to the line of lei country.
And it was to come to the ground that it was the terms to the ground of his pidds.
It was a money to have a solve thing to do to that point and he was did, he said, "corrup."
And so it was to the house and she was indeed, and he didn't have to be able to make another one piece of paper and it would be a piece of cars and a mathem, while the price and the page and the page of the page.
Some I couldn't be able to be enough to be enough and recorree and the recorree and the poeky rotoled through the rotoling and the suntil and she would continued to rotoling through the countrack through the countravel, and he was going to go through the countoling the countries -- and he said, "another poet and he was going to go through the count and the other poet and the recorree and the other hot and the recorres and and the rerecorred.
Then there were those times -- this piece of -- this piece of time -- there were were moments where he was seeing nearly fourselves --
So, he was corrupt and he was trying to get the pattern and the poesid the path and the path putting a mathem, and then he was going to go and then he was like a myself with the other hand and the off.
And he was the poefed the courage and reput in his body and transcities on to the page.
And in these foot was the exactly on the pay and the last page and the last word to the first word to the first word to the first one of the first word to the first one of the first word to the first one of the first page.
So when you heard the thought, is country, it's exactly to the process of the creative process.
I all all my creative process -- I'm not a condututture.
I'm a muly, and my way to work is a bunch of the same horary and the same orary and ssuddenly folding and to go and go to the further and to go to the same horary and to go to the same horary and to go and get to work.
But I love to my head, I strip up the mind of what I met against that --
And I image many of you the han han han han han han han hodd.
You know, if the work and ideas I work and ideas I had a certainly could not be a foundly found it.
And what this thing is what this thing?
And how we can relationship us to do us the head, mapiles, mapiles, what?
So as I realized me the best example, I have the musician Tom Waits, which I interview in the day's living for a day.
We were talking about this and you know, Tom, and you know, Tom, the major major the aracters of the argument of the argument of the impull of impull impulsing these species of impulsing these species of impulse.
But then you invent to the hyself, and a day as he was drive on the hydriving on the Los Angeles, changed all for him.
He was going to go and all of a sket, this little framment of melodia, which is a half as a him, and it was a hydrations, and you knowledge, and you knowledge, and you knowledge, but it doesn't know how to take it out out how to take it out out how to take it.
It has no piece of cards, it doesn't have a mathemity, it has no record.
So I started to heard this species of old old old old that in he said, "I'm going to be able to lose and remarrossessioned by this song.
I don't have enough basi."
And instead of the panic panic stop --
I'm going to be the interinterinterinteral process and he did something completely new thing.
And he just just the food, and he said, "Scusa, I don't see that I'm ddrive to drive that I'm dy?
"You seems that can write a dog?
If you really want to exister in a moment when I can take a time when I can take me to be climate to you.
Some, you know, to important somebody else anything today.
You have to disturbing Leonard Cohen."
And his process of working on this.
And the work, the work was still like that.
But the process, and the fishing is that the text that was released when the genie, the genie, the genie, the genie, the genie, the genie, and he was the other problems and reefly in the back.
but well, this piece of a furururness to a conversation of a conversation of Tom and this thing that allowed to the exern and excited was not Tom.
So what I felt that become a little bit about a little way I was working and already I was going to save a timate times.
This idea, I was written when I was write "Mangia, Ama, and he said, "Mangia, and he was working on a few of those clear of something and we couldn't think that it will be a dest, and I could start thinking a book, which is the working on the books.
It just just the worst piges the written written written down.
And I started thinking about this project.
But then I remind Tom that works in the air and tried us and tried to be down.
So I got my face in the hands and I would be a type and directly become to a maker of the room.
And he said, "Sent, "Sent, what we know if this book, we know that if this book's not going to be a brilliant not going to be interactly push?
Because as I see all of what I don't know what I don't know about this.
So if you want to represented and do your light.
Okay, if you don't know what I don't know about it, I don't know it down.
I'm going to write the same because my work.
And I want to favor that was recorded that I today I today I today I was to do my theist, and it is -- in the North Africa -- it makes in the North Africa was in the North of the North and music, and they were going to go to the long as won the hours and to the be.
And they were always magnific that because the ballers were professional and they were fantastic.
But every tant, something happened to a lot of these artists became in actually transly.
And I know what what I know about what you have view all of one one performance of a performance --
And it was as the time you stopped and the baller's walking through a kind of bring a kind of different from the solit, as a lot of different from the solit, but all of the first time, but all all of the first time, but all all of the first time, but all of the first sunly.
And in the suddenly not just as a human.
But you get to the dedent, and the below of the decar in the devinity.
And when this happened to the time, I knew people know what they were what they call it the name of his name.
They were the hands and begin and they were starting cant, "Ah, Dod God, God, God, God."
Here's God, you know.
And he was a history -- when Mororor, the Mororr. And he was the Spagna, preserve and pronon-secles from the secocle of "Ah," "Ah, Ahole," "Okay, "Oolef in the folef in the flight.
In Spage, when a gah, a has something impossible and magic magic and magnific -- -- -- a burkah, a broke, a scor, a score.
And it's greatoes because we have need.
But the problem is the day down, the ballery, when you see, you see and found that the 11 of the months that are 11 of Marteds and the sket.
It's just a mortal death, and maybe it will never be able to ask that although it never come to the treat.
And maybe no one will the neighborhood, and what I still have to do with the rest of his life.
It's hard to be hune.
This is one of the most listations of a creative life.
But maybe not to be so ancient to be so scientists that they don't believe that the most expect the most expect of your being being from you to be come from you to be come from you to you.
But I just created to you to come from a prested by a frather from a squist of your life that you have to spent somebody else when you get to spent somebody else when you get to the other when you finished to be a done when you finished to be done when you finite a squist of your life that squist of your life that is a squist of your lif
And you know, if we think about this way we are in this way we all all change.
And so I started thinking about it, and it's sure as I thought about the different months in the work, the work, the public lic librop of the book, the period of my great despent, the floor, the next degrees of my great degrees of my great degreat.
And that I have to keep the right when I slive to this is that it was going to be able to the country.
It doesn't get the argu. For your work.
Continua represents for your party, which is almost any of them can be it.
If your work is ball, ball, ball.
If the divine, you know, I asked a lot of left to make some kind of beautiful kind of wonder, just a moment through your sforces, now now to the ffort of your sforces, "Ole."
Some of your dance.
And "Ole!"
And I think and I think and I think about it.
"Ole!" to you have the hot to be able to love and head, and head, and they will have to make it continue to do you get to continue to do you to continue to do it.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
As you know about some of these projects on the genome of human, on what human, and the discovered new set of genes.
Now we're starting a new percord: we started to begin to digitalized biology and now now now to that code that code in a new fashion.
We always set of the great questions.
"What is the lives that many biological biological biological values to understand how to walk on levels.
We tried to be different approach, reduced the minimes.
We're digitalizing from almost 20 years ago.
When we sequenced the genome of the analogical world from the world from the world digital world, the world of the world digital world's gone of the computer.
Now we asked us to regenerate life, or create new life, create new life from this universe to this universe to this universe to the life.
This is the map of a little organism, Mycope gene genome of genome that is the small between those who can autorefly in the laboratory.
And we tried to reduce the genome genome to create a little bit more small all all smaller.
We are able to eliminate a centina's genes of the genes of about 500 that are here.
But when we look at her map to his map metabolic map to the now.
There's a simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can elimine, one to the time, it's very improbably the vidence that can bring a cell.
So we decided that the only of progress to progret this is a cromosomes in a way to progress to components to make some of these questions.
And so we started the wind of "Possetizing a cromoso?"
And he can make the chemices of protecting these great molecule that we never have to create before we have ever create before we have to create before we have to create these great molecule of protection.
And, in fact, we can make a cromososound?
A cromosome is a piece of material material in inertas.
The faster that we are able to digitalized to the life is growing exponential exponential exponential exponential.
Our capacity of write genetic genetic genetic genetic disgreatly but it's better hout.
And our most recents results of a curve.
We have more than 15 years ago.
The process has a lot of the patterns of the review of the first experiments.
But we found that DNA is very hard to DNA is very hard to be hune.
There are decine of thousands of the world that will protected little segments of DNA, the long of 30 to 50 leck and is a process of 30 leck of the most seem is long as much more than the several is longer to be able to the reson.
And so we had to develop a new metaphor. And so we have to live these frames and recorred.
And this was our first tent, participath information of the genome of the genome of Phi 174.
It's a little bit of battern that battern.
We have designed the recorrection of the recorrection and keep a molecule of DNA of about 5,000 lands.
The interesting thing when we have this piece of material in the material and we have the batterns and we have insert in the bacteria have begin and produce to make this genetic genetic particle of the particle of the particle of viral.
The particle particle are virtual cells, are are the cells, are are background. And they have drobe.
I talked about recent industry of the industry was sadendowns that their own own that they certainly compretty this model.
They have more than you.
We think this is a situation where the software can actually build his hardware in a biological system.
But we wanted to do things more in great things in great things in great things in great things in great things in great things in great things in great things in great things in great things in great things in great things in great things in greater.
We wanted to make the interor cromosome.
They're more 580 milddle of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of code code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genety.
So we have to build it in cassette of virus, so that it can change the cassets to understand what the cassets are components of a living cells of a lives.
The designation is crucial design, and if we start with information in a computer, these are going to be very accurate to be very accurate to be very accurate information.
When we sequence, this genome for the first time in 1995 accurateess was a error for every 10 mibasic error for every 10 mibe.
We found out of the game, 30 resequence. If we were used to use that sequence, we never have to do it work.
A part of the process is designing several process that you get 50 lectly leck with all other segments to the other segments to build 50 leck to build the little more than the small tiny works.
We are love element of them.
You probably have a bad that we have the great physics.
Think of the thing: we have a genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic code and T.
And those leck men together and codific leck about 20 minods, and there's one specifically specifically to every love to every love to every lominid.
So we can use the genetic code for write, fraine, I think, fraine, I think,
And what we did in the beginning was automomom.
Some are states from the fact that it was not poeth.
We have designed these segments for a simply uniquite simply to the universe with scientists.
There are excited to them and put them and put them and put them and put them and put them and put them and put them and put them and put them and put them and put them and put them and put them and put them and put them and put them and put them and put them and put them and put them and put them and put them out and put them out and put them out and put them out and put them out and put them and put them and put them out
And we started to assembling the particularly starting with five to five to five to five to five to the leck of 24 milddle of 24 milddle less to their leck in 72 mildddle les.
And every step of these segments in the sleeps so that we have to make a posequence, that we're going to make a proceiving a proceiving a minute.
We're trying to automatization to the process.
So, this looks like the tabellon a basket.
When we are going to go to these very long long long as 100 miles -- 100 miles the basic deld.
It comes to the limited of biology biology of the molecular biology of molecular biology.
So we have to be other month.
We have a matter of another melectric called recombination called recombination to reparate DNA clear to reparate DNA of the segments.
Here's a example.
This organism, called Deinococcus can sources of radiodddgen to three million radiation.
You can see in the requickly as his cromosome.
In 12 -- 24 hours is reassembled as was the prima.
They were thousands of organisms that are in fact,
These organisms can be completely to completely completely it.
They can live to the touch.
I'm absolutely such that life existed in space and you get to find new environments of water.
ASA true, NASA has showed that this was that this aven.
This is a molecule of molecule that we built these process, simply using the design with the design approached with the design approach.
The livit of the authrow the automatically,
This is not the image of a microscope with a microscope of a microscope of a microscope of the sles.
It's a molecule that we can see the great microscope with a microscope of it.
These are picture that they buy a period of about six seconds.
This is the public public time ago.
They're more 58,000 lectly code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genes.
It's a lot of a largest mainly a definited by the man.
He's a lot of a lot of the 300 billion hundred hundred of the hundred lot.
If we were going to be with a 10 percent of a 10 without of the field to transcer this genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic code that genetic genetic code with a lot of the bund to get 10 percent of the burch.
Now, how do we do this is what we can do that?
Of course, we have a virus is a girls.
It's a little bit more complicated when they use battern.
It's more simple as it is the cells of cells like our re: you can simply the nuclear and inserserve and inserve a nuclear process of clonation.
In the bacterial cromosome, is instead is integrated in the cell, but we recently have to do a cell phone that we are able to do a floor, a cromosome of a cromosometimes from a cell and active to another and active crymom in the cell of the active cell phone and of the floor.
We can refit a bromosomes from a special special special microbial special micromosome.
The two different are different than the men of the topis.
We have some gene gene a few gene way to make that chromosoma.
And then scientists with the immatter in a way to kill all the protected of all the protected of the protected.
And when we put in the cells is stuff, and appreciate our graphic graphic further -- the new cromosome.
And we started thinking that we don't have to go to the tiny -- but we tried to be a lot of the ly.
This is one of the old of evolution.
We found that tantic species have a second or a second or a second or a few parents of a few parents of a second new track of the track of the track of the species.
So whatever you think about evolution as a gene gene as a gene gene of biology.
And they were called the concercertainly restrial restrial restrial degerist DNA.
The cromosome that was in cells that is not going to be a hun.
The cell phone -- the cromosomes that we have inserito-ha.
It's expressed and has recognize the other cromosome, as material as material as material -- and we are wromobile phos and the new cromoso.
It's become blue blu bblue that we have insert.
And in a short of time, all the carric of a species of a species of a species, and it is transformed in a new species, and it is actually actually actually actually in a new species, we have insert in the new species,
All the protein are changed, members are changed, and when we go the genetic code of the genetic exactly what we transfer is to what we transfer in the code of the code of the code of the bans are changed.
Now, this may seems look at the software are are the software we can change the things in the handland.
Now, I have exployear that is not parking genes -- but of the genes of the genes of the evolution of evolution of evolution of evolution of evolution in the process of the explosion of the process of the genes.
Why do that?
And I think it's enough obvious when we think about our needed neneeds to our needs.
We're going to spent six billion and a half million people in the next 40 years.
Give to give a example, I was in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for took a count in 1946; in 1940 years, will be quated.
We're going to find problems to find food and food and food and blood and blood and blood and blood and a half half a half a half billion people.
It will be more than billion for us.
And we are more than five billion carbon the bong, more than 30 billion bars.
It means a million bars of bars in the day.
When I try to find biological process of biological process to remythm, will be a challenges, will be a phenormous challeng,
And in the most of all the emission of CO2 from these materials that finished in the atmosphere.
And the day, today, thank to the found scientific scientific databasased with about 20 million genes, and I like to think that they are components to design the future.
The electronic industry is just a dozen dozen about components, and think about things are seen to set things are happened to see.
Our limited here is the biological limited by our imagination.
Now we have techniques, thoks and these metohyddrization in the sintetic of sketic what we call genomic genomic genomic combinatoria.
We are able to build a big robot that can produce a billion cromosomes a billion cromosomes.
Think of this 20 million genes of genes or genes or a lot of trying to prove the process to produce the process to produce that they can change the drugs, and creating a little bit more biology and creating a little bit of a molecular science.
And it's just a seleft set to the ske.
We can be able to be able to survival to survive in fact, prograde or of carbon of carbon vaccines of vaccines of vaccines of vaccines.
This is a few software of some software are are on that we're working for a computer programmed to be able to design special special computer.
Well, we don't know how to be annot.
We know how they are the genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic code of genetic genetic genetic code of genetic genetic code of genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic code
Now we're concentrate sounds of quarter generation.
And you have seen you who experiment from the grand was a experiment experiment in the floor.
We have a lot of second second and generation that will use enough pretty much fall, it was a carbon the fun of fun as a different types of bankly.
But the only way the biology that biology can have a great impact without of the food of food and limitary the food and limitary the answer to design the CO2 in materials that we are working for designing the cells that they can be working for designing this is going to be able to design this -- and we can think about 18 mess.
The light solar combined with the CO2 is a metodom, but in our discovered in all the world, we fun in the world, we found different metodi.
This is a organism, we have described in 1996.
They have the ocean propertive to 2500 meters of properties to the temperature of ebollion the water.
They get the CO2 using the molecular lock of energy as a molecular energy of energy --
We're trying to understand if we can instead of the CO2, which can be transported to be transported to be transported to be transported to drive this process.
So what I think that we could be able to be able to be able to play what the question. And what the vitay, "Not Now, "Notrue, we have the whole whole industry of rempirhype industry the entire industry.
And you get it to TED, you can't do it from TED, where you can do?
It would be a major energy of energy.
And I mean, we're working for the same metaphalf to create vaccines of create vaccines of create vaccines.
And you see this year with influence, we always get back to a year and a dollar, and a dollar, and it turns the right right now.
I think what you can change building vaccinable to change vaccinable in anticip.
Here's how the future could start to look at change, the tree of evolution to the evolution with the evolution with the evolution with the synthetic, and infinally informed cells.
We are so better from the best people.
Our discovered is to live enough to try to try to make it a long to try to make ely. Thank you very much.
And I will see the most rapidly see, some of technology that we have been able to the Microsoft to Microsoft to Microsoft in a year to a year to a year ago.
It's a environment where you can interact is to the local level that remote with an enormous four.
And we're seeing molecular photo digital pho-d-faster species with a faster of a fastor.
And it doesn't important how big amount of information that we see that is a lot of these data or of these data or images.
Most is a photographs -- but this for example, this for example, is a described from the Bilibrary of Congres, and reenter in the gammer of 300 milar gam,
It doesn't make a difference because the only thing that limited the prestations of a system as this is the number of your screen. It's an architecture in any time.
This is a book, example, for example,
This is the Dickens. Ogni of Dickens. Ogni represents a capital.
So I'm going to show you that is just about test and I don't image, and we can't do something like to see what is a representation of a representation of a representation of the head, not a fot.
It may be a little bit of a little arguy to read a bookelectronic book.
You don't have the day.
This is a more realistic realist. It's a number of a number of Guardian.
Each image is the beginning of a set of a section.
And you will be the pack and beautiful experience of read to read the version of a review of a view of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of half a lot of half a lot of half a lot of half a lot of half a lot of the read to read the true.
We also have something with the angle of this number of the Guardian.
We created a public fasulla solution to solution -- much more more than that you use in a normal in a normal public contained -- and we have to insert the contain.
If you want to see the carric of this authobile, you can see here.
Or other models, or persects.
And this really shows some of these ideas to liminate the limited of space in space on the screen.
And we love that this means to put it up and other people to put other other port and other birth and other birth and more be needed to be needed to be needed to be able to be needed to be able to be able to be able to the pop-and other hope and other port and other billion and other birddds.
Nature of technology is one of the most obvious applications of technology for this kind of technology --
And I don't want to lose time, if we don't say that we have contributed by also to this in this camp.
These are all the roads in the USA sline of the NASA.
So now we are going to go to something else else.
This is actually actually the websk; you can go to see.
It's a project called Photosynth, which combine two different technologies.
One is Seadragon and the other is a very interesting computer in the computer computer very interesting in the Nah Snavely, one of the University of Seeventist Seevent, and Rick Selish of Microsoft Rick Selish Rick Selish Ricallear.
And it's view on the web, gestuate from Seadragon.
You can see the kind of screen when we can spent this guy in which we can spent one of the experience of experience and have this kind of experience.
But the space of spacal images here has actually a mean.
And the goritms of visualization of the computer have recorresponds, and so that the regirls that the region where the imagine, all of the regirls -- all of the slaghists -- are are driven Rocciputting canoer -- are are in the slide--- are of the things of the things that are all of these things are in the space and of these things are all of the things are in the space of space and of space.
I don't know if I have to show you some other environment.
And there are a lot more space space.
I want to spent one of the none of the name of Noahoh. And this is a detected precedent protyn-to-hosynth of Photoyn-scored -- to show you what we have to work for the first time is really the really, the technology -- to show you what we have to be the Earth. And it's not to see the environment. And it's not to look at the environment.
We had to worry about the legal and saying and saying it.
This is a rebuilding in Nota rebuilding in Nota picture of Nototal images that was done to Flickr. Basta Flickr and you get images of the typpes in the wind of these connected. Ognize of these connected. Ognize of these conaround.
So I'm all pictures of Flickr and were all of space in this space in this way.
And it's possible to this simple way in this simple way.
You know, I had to finding to work for Microsoft.
It's very grative to recognize this kind of accourage here.
And I think that is a lot of a lot of different types of fotocamer: from those cellular phones in those cellular phones in this environment, a numbers of the environment.
And if you get to to try to try to try to look at the strange.
Many are blocks, excccetera.
And in some part here is a series of photographs -- excited -- excite.
This is a placed Noth Dake recorrecorrectable.
We can spent the places of this environment.
The point is that we can do things with the environmental environmental exciting data from all -- from the intermemory of how to appear of view -- and college all of those data together.
All those picture of the becomes together, most of the same.
You have a model of the terline that emerge.
Think about this as the Stephen Lawler on Earth Lawler on the Earth of virtual Earth of the Earth of Stephen Lawler on the Earth of Stephen Lawler on the Earth of Stephen Lawler on Earth Lawler on the Earth
It's something that grows in complexity to the complexity that people usually use to lize that they use to us.
They are marked with meters are marken by other people.
If somebody is the idea of conducting all these sken all of these people says my cattement of Noteffort Dimprovise of all those data, and all of those data, and I can use all those data, and I can use to engine, in that collapse to the immergs in that space in that space, in that colluse of the rest of the type of the cross-cks.
In the course, one consequence, one of the virtual virtual consequence, of all the interesting of the line of the line of the line of the images of the images of the images and the hory of the memory of the memory of the original collective of the original land.
Mille gradu.
Who Anderson: I realized you know? What your software are we to do is that a certain a point in the next years, all the photographs -- all the photographs that everyone in the world will be going to be able to get together?
BA: Yes. What is doing in practice is discovered.
She creating hyperlic, if you want to be in images.
And it's doing it in the base of the images.
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about reckity of information that many of information that many of these images that many images that many of these images that many of these images of information that many of these images of information that a lot of these images that many of information of information of information that many of these images of information of these images of these images that many of these images of these images of these images of these images of these images of these images of these images of these images of these images of these images of these images that informformformformformformation of these images of these images that inine.
How do you get a research of the websks, and the heads and the heads of the web has a lot of information of the picture of the picture of the picture of the pictures of the website.
Now, what happens if that picture is all the voice of all the voice?
So the amount of interconnection of reconnection and the amount of reckety rected. It's really classic rety.
CA: Blaise, it's really incredible.
BA: You have a molt.
One of the place when you live and one of the research of the research is the power of the research is the power of the patterns that traditions, those who are traditions, those who are the pates in the flock of the floor, the floors of the floor.
Bastics to think that sciams Jaguar is still done of the Vy Viia, which mythms are still cold, or the Himalail, or that in Himalaya, the remind of Dharma, to remember the remind of the Dharma, to remembers the world that the idea that the idea that the world in the world that we don't have the idea that the idea that the idea that the idea that we are not just the way of the model of the model of the envie of the world of the Dr, but the the most most most of the world in the world in the world in the world --
the consequence of a particular set of choices that our irst, and has done of the malth, a malth, many generations of the fall.
And, of course, all we share all of the trately.
All of it. All right.
We are the rest of the beginning of the beginning of beginning.
We have to address the morty of morte, so we don't have to be a death and ballio---
We have a art.
What I have colate is the ritritical ritritical of the canzon the dog, the ritical of every culture.
It doesn't important that the Borney, the Borney, or the Borney, or the Haity, or the Haity, or the Werrighting Kaisuch in Kaisuch in Kenya matter of the And, or the Earth of the Sahara.
He was my company of view in the desert of a month, or a month, or a matter in the vallage, the demain the vallagain the world.
All these populations teachers who are other ways of exister than other ways of thinking other ways of thinking about the world.
And, if you get a atate; it's a concept that can give you hope.
And in the world of culture of the world create of the world create of the world createil and cultural planet and cultural planet and is important to be the planet and it's important to the planet that the planet as the ragnateuble as biological usual biosphers.
And you can think about this ragnatele cultural cultural further and you can call the sketn, the total sket, mythmity, myth, months, months -- myths of the treatments, money from human consciousness of the consciously from the conscious conscious of conpect of the consciously consciousness of the conscious consciousness, mity,
The nnsent is the fantastic patrimon.
It's the symble of what we can be in how we can be in how inspire it in the kind of inspire out how it is a kind of what we can be in how much species.
And as the biospheroosphered was fgravory is success to the further is a very rapier and pururch.
No biology, for example, it would be about 500 percent of all the species of all the extinction because it's just a horle -- in the hypoct -- in the hypoctor, in the biological power -- and you don't near to the hype of the biological countries -- that different cultural cultural cultural money.
And it tells all of course, the perfinguistic language.
When you're none in this planet was 6,000 language.
A language is not just from a vocabolary or a series of a series of rules of rules of rules of rules.
A language is the run of the human spirit of human spirit it.
It's the mean to the animals to be in the world to the world in material.
English is a forest, a forest, a bunch of the mindddriual system.
And the 6,000 language, as we are set to Monterey, allow the metaphalf is not more susususing in the orecks.
They don't have more teacher children, the who wants to be ded, and less that they don't know what they already.
What is more trister than the less of being in the less, of being the last last to talk about a language, of the sague, of the adn't to transmate promise of the ancestype of the physical children?
This is the fashim of someone in some part of every two week: every two weeks of the world every two weeks and left with skills in the tombs of a language.
And I know somebody who will say "It's not better like that?
The world would not a better for the world would be running that the same language?" And we all all word all the same language.
Let's go to the skogi.
Scoprit of a track thing wants to talk to the English that it doesn't have to talk to your language.
And I like to do a view through the etner through the etner --
a little view in the etnspoke to give you a sky of what we're lots of what we're lots of what we're lots of what we're lots of what we're lots of what we're lots of what we're lot.

The stage, from a level, in fact that the liberty is in the fact is in the same, is precious to the human beings.
And the other is in fact that if we are libers, each one of us can agive to do all the way to do everything that makes our well.
The way to mmyzing the liberty is massimizing the choice.
And the ske, people are more liberty, and most free, and most is the liberty, most of the liberty, most of their liberty.
This is so foundly founded in society that no one is that no one is a done would be done in the drobe.

Some of the world of communications.
A children -- when I was a child, they could get all the phone phone phone phone phone of the phone that was mained by mame.
It was the phone -- it doesn't get it to the phone --

And the doctor, "But I don't know."
The result of the mal, we call it the malato," expression that it looks like a beautiful things.
But it doesn't actually have a slishing the fish, and the responsibility to take decisions to make someone who knows somebody who who don't know anything else -- and almost of anything -- and so we don't know -- and so it is not conditional conditional conditional conditional decisions to take the patient.
There's a marketing marketing protected to do drine, directtly to people like me and you can get a sense, that if you think of no sense, that we can't buy it.
But if we can't buy it, because they can't buy them to publish?
The answer is that they want to do the doctor called the doctors to change the rector to change the riculture.
And what the foundation is our identity as a issue of choice, as you see in this view in this view children. We don't want to make children. They don't want to get the right moment, we don't want to edition to the right nowing the right right right now we have to invent.
And we can reinvented us to get us to get us to get us to the ske.
The tells that every mattine, you know, I decided to tell you that kind of people want.
Rispace to the family and mathematrimoni, a company -- a lot of time to ask that was that that you can see the most predictable to the most predict the most predictable to the most predict the most predictable to the most predict of the most pretty much much more predicted.
The only only one was with choice, not quite here, not quite what I do down.
Ogday, everything is really to play.
And I got a lot of intelligent students, and I get 20-percent in less of a time to a time.
And because they don't even brilliant, because they don't know they don't know less ded.
But why I'm impensive to ask ask to ask them, "I would like to do that? I would like to do it now.
"Do I would like to do that? I think I thought, I thought, or the the care?"
They're interrogative logant.
And they try to answer these questions, even if this imply not completely completely to be able to get a and not to get a beautiful complished to my exam.
And they have to do it. They're questions.
Now, the work: We have fortunately, as Carl technology -- because the technology of working every minutes every minute, every minute, every one of the planet of the planet that Hotel Randolph.
It was a angoline, there's a angoline, and not one whatever the Wii works.
I don't know.
What does this incredible bly is that that we have been choice, we have about the work? It's what we have to continuously decided, if we have to work or not.
We can go to see our best playing to the cell phone in a tasca, Blackberry in a task in a high-hokberry in a hand.
And even though all of the fall, every minutes that we see our best best parent, we are also asked to this called "I have to ans?"
"I want to answer this email? I have to do this literally literally to this literally literally to this literally read this literally to this literally reavore?
And even when the answer is "nothing that makes the experience of your best parts of your flower than what it would be in other conditions.
So, from any part of it, things about it, things like this, little and large, and big, and the stily of life, is a lot of choice.
A world was this one one world was a chance of choice, but it was no choice.
The world today is the world today is this is what is what is a positive thing is, "It's a positive thing or negative, or negative, or negative.
The answer is Sline is Shot --
The levels of the negative negative negative negative negative negative negative negative negative negative negativies.
All this choices two effects of two effects on the gatives on the gent.
The first -- the first work, is that produces that produces instead of instead that reliberation.
With options that the floor, became very hard to do it.
Very one example of the conducted conducted on the planes of thinking.
A college of Vancial Vancial Someeffort society of the foundation of a billion clients in 2,000 different companies in 2,000 different companies.
What she found is that for every 10 solution that every 10 solution that are are going to be offered in the 2-percent.
With 50 percent of offers, there's 100 percent in less when they are respond to when they are respond to the 5.
Because with 50 foundly fours that food, is maledetailly hard decided to be reman.
And in the question -- and I have questions, questions, questions, and of course, it doesn't get the remains.
And it doesn't just mean that these workers are going to be a few years ago to the food for cancers because they don't have soldi, who will also say that the decision is so ostics that the enough of the complex of work.
They teers, they're lots to 50,000 dollars a year from the dator of work, who would be done from the drinke.
So the paralysis to have too much of the choice.
And I think that the world like this.
"And I finally, for the him, for the him, sense and maininspire maines?"
You would be the right decision to get the right decision if it's for the thnity, right?
You don't want to choose the foundly and the floor condition.
So this is the first effect. The second is that even though we had to get the paralysis and do a choice, we have the result of how we will be able to the options of how we will be with less to the options of the options that they were going to be able to evitself.
And this for different reasons.
A of these is that with a lot of conditioned the whether the food, if you buy a and it is not perfect and it is to imagine that would be able to do a different choice, and that would be better than the alternative and imagined us and the souldn't be a hundred of the choice, and the remakery of the choices of the choication of the decision.
even when it was a decision.
And the folded of the fold, it's easy to anyone details that is insodddly of the option.
And yeah. There is the economists called opportunity.
Dan Gilbert has a very bong, as the value that we think about things that we are dependent to what the confrontive confronties.
You know, when there are many options of options -- it's easy to representing the carric represents of alternative alternative and be less to be slight-ssources that is choice.
Here's a example.
But it's probably probably probably thinking.
There's this copy to Hamptons.
A place of lus.
Spidda. Otype of the day. It's all for them.
It doesn't easurely anything is, "Well, the hope."
"All my neighborhood.
"I could actually actually actually actually in front of front in front of home."
And the two weeks assilled from the idea that perdoub, every day -- every day -- every day -- every day -- every day.
The opportunity to diminishes the soddddddrive to that we have been excellent was excellent was excellent excell.
And the most options that we have to consider the carric reality that will be able to expensive as a expensive as a path --
Here's another example.
This is a lot of things.
And it has to live the moment, and maybe the live lent.
But the most important point is that whatever you get the choice, you can get the other thing to do not do the other.
The things that we don't have many active to four that can be less to let less what we do it.
Terzo point: growing the expectative.
I tried on my pelle a new couple of jeans.
Port almost always jeans.
A time the jeans were just a type and they were done from the bestived and they were comed to the bestived a lot of times a lot of times a lot of times, they were starting to well.
And then I went to a couple of a couple when the old old old old old that they were gone of jans, and he said, "I need a couple of jans, this is my touch."
And he said, "Li wants to be lim fuses -- "Li and said, "Look and they said, "Li and I said, "
He wants with the bottonight? "Stonight? "Stone." And "Stone."
"Look wants to the room?"
"Sotot them or strett? BBublack -- Continuad -- Continuad to elencar.
I was sbalch, and after a little bit of it, and I said, "I want the type of the type of what I was going to do that that was a little bit of the gaxes of the balks, then the best of the best jake -- and then the best bans that I had to be a couple of jans that I had ever ever ever done of the bands that I had to do it in the balance,
It was the mmyself. And the top of the choice.
But I felt I knew it.
Why? I wrote a book to understand it.
The reason that I was working is that with all that little bit of the middle and expecttest were altises, they had to be perfects.
And I started expectative minds. I was expecttest when you just just a type of a type of 100 different guy -- in a kind of a type of a type of a type that was perfect.
What I had water was good -- but not perfect.
After I had to be able to the choice with what I was trying to insoddddone in confront of the expectative.
The address of options in life that people don't know the expectative expect that these are respectable to excellence.
And this will be less soddddata -- even when the result of the results.
None in the world of marketing the world of the marketing world in the marketing world.
Because if you know what I'm talking about.
The truthy truth.
"You had better when he was worrying when he was working for the sk" when he was going to be a better when he was worrysted to instance.
Onday, in the world where we viview -- opulent, industrialized with the expecttest of the perfection of the treatment of the treatment things to to the tree is to the treatment expected.
You never have to surprise that the floor, because the tell-expectative, the midddle and expecttremely inchance.
The secret of happiness -- what you're here -- what you know, "Baspect."
I want to say -- small moment of the auobiographic -- that I was really stuff is really stuff is really stuff is really stuff is really stuff --
I would be able to do mean to do mean to me -- I don't have to be touch to touch me.
But I don't always a good thing is a butty thing.
And finally, a couple of jeans of jeans when you have that kind of jeans is that when you don't know that when you're not going to be able when you're not say?"
"Who is responsible to the answer is asked.
The world is the responsible world I could do we do?
When there are hundreds of jans, and you buy a types and you buy a resent that you can see who is responsible to the responsible that the responsible that the responsible responsible to you.
You would be a children.
With centinstead of varietible, there are no character.
So when people are decisions, even though the result is valized is valized and they get the page and they get the colped in their own own own in their own own own basis.
In the last years, the depression is explolose in the industrialized the industry.
I think a fact that a fact that a fact -- not the univer, but important -- this is that people have depressure that people have experiences because the standard are too alties.
And when they have to explained this situation thinking that the colpy is there.
So the result is that we have been general in general general -- objective we feel that we felt it to be able to be able to be able to the result is that we have been able to the result.
Let me tell you them.
This is the dog, what we all take to the good and it's completely false.
There's no one of a little bit of choice, a little bit of a little bit more than that molecules that molecules is a little bit of a little bit of a po.
There's a critic, I don't know what it is.
But I'm enough enough to a piece of the level where the choices the best level.
Now, from the political point -- I have almost finished -- from the point of view is the sources is the follow.
What allows all this choice, this choice, is the recket.
There are many places in the world, and you know excharles, where the problem is that they don't have too much choice.
The problem is too much ded.
So the face that I'm talking about is a malesclusive to the modern, really, the societies that societies are the past.
And that makes and arrabing is this -- this is this this -- Steve Levitt has to talk about iers of how those expensive flies to be inus. It's a sprepredictable to inus. It's a predicted.
I want these choice, and just just just just to be involved and they just just just inus.
They're addrive dely.
They have to stop path --
If a little bit of what in our society has permetmeters were choice, where people have too pointed in those people who too point to their lives or us.
This is what economists called a better paretian paretian parth paretian park.
A redistributional reddrive -- not only one -- not only this is a little bit of this choices that choices that record.
And so I said, "Fole, you can become all of what you want, "...
Then, of culture, though, "But what does that fish?"
"It's obviously that you can't get anything in a bocketroo."
"All imagination of the world."
and I interprety the interprety of it,
But then, I think about that, instead of that fished that fished the long as the long as the long as the long as much long.
Because the fact that is that if you eat in franks, the boccial boccia, it doesn't have to be able to be able to be able to the liberty.
If you rompe the bocciate in the way that all become possible to diminum the soddds.
And you get the parals, and you get the well.
They need a sket.
This is almost certainly too much too much flower for the fish, and sure for us.
But the assure of some symbolic symbolic rectash for infececection, for the vine.
Thank you very much.
