Last year, I showed these slides to show that the calculum glacial calote, which for almost three million years of the size of 48 of the United States of the continental continental continental from 40-percent.
But this undervalue the gravity of the problem because it doesn't show the ice of the ice because it doesn't show the ice of the ice.
The artic glacial calotta is, in a way, the heart of the global climate system.
It gets sends and winter reverse and return it down.
The next slide is going to be a quick fast on the last 25 years.
The glaciers have red.
As you can see it expand it up to the blue blue blue blue blue blue blue blue blue blue blue blue blue blue blue blue blue blue blue blue of it.
That's the ice in the ice that is the ice reverse of the summer.
You can see the so-called perennae, five years or more, is like blood here from the body.
In 25 years old.
This is a problem because the climbering of the ice is really interested in the glacious ocean around the artic ocean where there are huge amount of carbon congelated that is that that monkey is transformed in the metane from the microbis.
I received the totality of the pollutionary of global warming, that amount could double that doesn't return.
In some deep deep in Alaska the metan is already reboiling from the water.
The professorse Katey Walter of the University of Alaska has been on a team based lake last slake.
Video: Wow! Al Gore: She is good. The question is, if we are also going to be us.
A reason is that this is that this thermal warmor warming the Groenland from the north.
This is a glacial record of glacial record.
The laughed has never reached layers.
This is the Kangerlussuaq, in the the Southwest of Groenland --
If you want to know how the sea level of the sea ice to the ground ice -- that's where the sea is where the sea.
These currents, are increasingly.
On the other side the planet.
The scientists have delivered the scientists have declaim that the ice is negative, and the Western Antartarctickets, which is particularly rapid on some submarine islands -- it's particularly fast.
Equival about six feet of water, as the Groenland, as the Groenlland,
Himalaya, the third largest block of ice -- you see new laghi, you see a few years ago were glaciers.
40 percent of the world's population reduced half the pounds of the pool.
His Andeath: This glacier is the source of the water water water water water of this city.
The laughed is increased.
But when it decrecreased the same thing happens.
In California snow in California is 40-percent.
The hydrogen issues are in crisis.
Dessions, as you have ready, they're grave.
The growing for safe in the world leads to a nice night increases of the fixes of prevents.
The disasters are increasing a rhythm up to a rhythm and unprecedentents.
Four times the most numbers in the last 30 years than the previous 75.
This is a whole thing that is unsustainable of all insusustainable.
If you look at the history of the history of you can see the consequences.
In the last five years we added 70 million tons of CO2 to 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the ocean every day.
Look at the East East East East East East Amer, in the Americh, and both the parts of the subject the continent in the ocean continent in the ocean ocean in the ocean ocean
The most cause of global warming, together to deforestation, with the deforestation, which is 20 percent, is the use of fossil fuel.
Oil is a problem, and the carbon is even worse.
The United States are one of the two countries with more emissions, together at China.
And he was proposing to build a lot of other central carbon central different carbon central
But we're looking at a direction.
These are the projects in the last few years and some evidence of alternative verh of the green alternative vers.
Each way, there's a political lots in our country.
The carbon industry and oil has 250 million dollars in the last year to promoting carbon to promoting carbon to promoting carbon dioxymore.
That image reminded me something.
Very Natalalt in Tennessee, where I live, there's been a 3.8 billion gallons of carbon didioxial digging of carbon dixizar.
Maybe you saw it on the news of the news
This is the second largest flow of America's scories in America.
It happened around Natal.
The natalization of one of the carbon industry was this.
Video: Frosty the carbonaian is a kind of hallegry and happy.
It's abundant here in America, and it makes our economy.
Frosty the carbonaian is increasingly more and cleaner.
It's about price, adorable and adorable and the work are the sticking.
Al Gore: From here is a lot of carbon West Virginia.
The biggest minerary companic is Massey Coal. This is his friendly.
Don Blankenship: Don Blankenship: I'm clear -- not know what they're talking about.
Al Gore: So the Alleance for the Clima Protee has launched two campaigns.
This is a part of it, a part of it.
Video: Ate: At: FiCOALergy we see the climate change as a nightful night to our business.
For this priority is to invest a big amount of money in a very strong advertising to make the public and confused the carbon truth and confused the carbon truth to make it carbon.
In fact, carbon is not spore.
We think it's clean -- it also has a good profume.
So not pushed the climate change here.
Let me do us.
Video: At: Cbone clean -- you know, you've heard a lot of it.
So let's do it a turn around a structure at a structure at the structure of the clean as a clean as a clean as a clean as a clean as a clean as a as a clean as a clean as a clean as a clean as a clean as a clean as a cleaning as a clean as a
Straordinary! The machines are a little noisy of the clean technology of the clean technology --
The carbon consumption is between the main causing global warming, but the night technology in the most clean technology that you see it changes everything.
Take a look at this is the hated hat.
Al Gore: Infinally, the positive alternative alternative to the economic issues and the national security.
Video: Comment: America, crisi; America, national security crisis.
The file that connects the whole is: our dependence from fossil fuels and oil oil oil oil oil oil mate.
Now, yet, there's a new solution for users use.
Rear America: 100 percent of clean energy, in 10 years.
A plan to re-the work to make America's work, make us sure safe global warming.
Finally, a solution that you basts to solve our problems.
Reaches America. Scover of the more.
Al Gore: This is the last one.
Video: He's about reducing energy.
One of the fastest ways to end end up the dependence on the dependence that planet.
Comparsa: The future is here. Vento, sole, a new energy.
It is a number 2: Novi investments for jobs to work very well-retribute jobs.
Comptud: Rear America. It's time to be realist.
Al Gore: A proverbial African says, "If you want to go fast, go fast, go to fight themselves.
If you want to go far away, you get together."
We have to go far fast.
Thank you very much.
Last year at TED I did a introduction on the LHC.
And I promises of return back to you on how the machine.
So here I am here I are. And for those time they don't have the LHC is is the biggest scientific experiment -- 27 miles of circuits.
His job to reach the conditions that were present less than a billion-second second from the beginning of the universe -- until 600 million times a second.
This is just the environment.
This is the car below Ginevan.
We Fotographic these min-Big in the relevel.
This is what I work. It's called AS -- it's called AS -- it's 44 meters and he's a 2meters and it's 2meters.
This is a picture of ATLAS in built so you can see the proportion of proportions.
The 10 last year we have accepted the car for the first time.
And this picture was taken by ATLAS.
It was because of a bunch in control room in control.
It's a picture of the first particle of particles that had done the whole LHC, entertaining in the collision, deliberately, with a part of the LHC, and spreading particles into the relevel of the LHC, and spread particles into the relevel of particles in the relevel of
In other words, when we saw that image the 10 image of the 110 -- we realized that the machine works, which is a great vittoria.
I don't know if it was this to do it exploit more than that, when someone went to Google and saw that the page was this.
That means that we have a cultural impact beyond scientific impact beyond scientific impact beyond scientific impact beyond scientific impact beyond scientific impact beyond the scientific impact beyond scientific impact beyond scientific impact beyond in the scientific impact of the scientific impact beyond scientific impact beyond the scientific impact of the scientific impact of the scientific impact of the scientific impact of the scientific impact of the
About a week, there was a problem with the machine, there was a problem with the machine,
These files are 13,000 amps when the machine works at the massive power of potence.
Now, the technicians who are going to look at the files and say, "It's not true. I'm filming too underly."
And instead can do it because when they're very co-fresh films.
So, at least 271 degrees, at least 271 degree temperature at the space between the stars, these files can bring that current temperature --
In one of the junctures in the mostly in the LHC, there was a fabrication.
So the files are going to read read read and 13,000 amps suddenly meant a electricity.
This was the result.
Now, this is even more impressive, if you think these magnetic fish about 20 tons, and that have been moving about 30 centimeters.
They got about 50 magnetic at about 50 magnets.
We had to take to pay them, what we did about.
We repristinated them and uploved them.
Now they're now coming back to their place on the underground.
By the end of the end of the LHC is will be new intea.
And we would like that, and we expect to get some data to just get the right or him, and we continue so our adventure to find out what are the morning that is the universe.
Now, of course, in a certain qual way, these accidents reaccepepeping the debate on the value of science and engineering engineering in front of it. It's easy to confuting.
I think that the fact that it's so difficult, the fact that you can go beyond the limits, I think this is the value of things like LHC.
I would like to conclude with the words of a scientist, Humphrey Davy, the guy, which, in the defense of his pupill, his pupill, his pupill, his pupill, his pupill, said, "No is as dangerous for the progress of the human mind as much of the human science is definititive to the progress are definitely definititive to us is not new money.
Thank you.
I want to start asking you to rethink about when you were children, played with the morning.
And as you can reach them and grab them, take them and make them and make them move them, and you learn to think and solve them, and you can actually think about solve and space.
The spacecraft reasoning is deeply connected to the way we understand the world around us.
So, from the informath of inspired by our own physical objects -- with my own own to my own own Patti, and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi, I started asking myself to say, "And if we use a computer, instead of having the mouse as a computer, instead of just as a digital polypplies that will move on a desktop, we could give you a information to entering your hands,
and we get it to our pleasures our pleased pleasure.
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer, building the answer, building the answer, building the Siftable.
In a few words, a Siftable is a big interactive computer.
In a few words, a Siftable is a big interactive computer.
You can move them with the handle can move with their hands, and they can see their movement, and they have a wireless radio and a wireless.
But most of course, they're physicists, as physics, as the morning, you can just move it to affect it by the morning,
The Siftable is the example of a new tools to manipulate digital information.
And as they become more physics, you know, you know about the movement, others, and as they become more physics, and as they become more physics, you know about movement, of other how we move them to the new and different style stil.
I'm going to start with some simple example.
This Siftable is configured to show some vide: if you include it in a direction, the video like this, if you including the other hand, if you include the other side back.
These interactive portraits of the other other people are conscious of the others.
If they grab them to be interested in what they were.
If they come surround, they can see it and they can get a little bit.
If they come surround, they can see it and they can get a little bit.
They also have their movement, and unlining.
We then realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was the way to use common data, to say, "Look a color as if it was a liquid.
In this case, we have three Siftable configured as blood and I can use them to go to the middle of the color in the middle of the color in the middle of the gurges in the middle of the worth of the worst of the color in the middle of the same thing, where they mix.
and I can use them to switch them to the central that they mix it.
We can make a little bit of it, we can put a little bit of it.
There are also nice possibility of learning as languages, as mathematics and games where people can try to try things fast.
Now I'm --
This is a Fibonacus sequence that I do with a curriculum.
So here we have a game of words that is at half of the Scarabeo and Boggle.
Morically, at every turns, you get a letter to every Siftable, Pratically, at every turns, you get a letter to case on every Siftable, and as you try to make words about a dictionary.
And then about 30 seconds are remissing, and you have a new set of readers and new possibility.
Thank you.
Here's what the children came to the Middle Middle Lab, I made them and I turned a video video game.
They are very much pleased to it.
And one of the interesting things about this kind of application is that you don't have to give you a lot of education.
You've got to just say, "Compone," and they know exactly what to do.
Here's what other people who try it.
This is our younger better.
It actually wanted to be willing to get there.
They were only morning, for him.
Now, this is a application of a interactive cartone interactive carton.
We wanted to build a tool, to the learning of the EnLui is Felix.
It can be able to put new characters in the scene, satisy the scene, they associated with it.
It can be able to put new characters in the scene, satisy the scene, they associated with it.
So it's doing the sun.
Video: The sun is surgend.
David Merrill: Now it has taken a treatment in the scene.
Video: The arancient treatment.
Bel work! Yes!
So schooling the Siftable and put the close close to can interact the characters --
Video: Bau!
And when you invention history.
Video: Hell!
DM: It's a story with the open final and can decide him as you did.
DM: It's a story with the open final and can decide him as you did.
Video: Gule, flew -- I got to do it.
DM: The last example I have time to show you is a tool, made recently recently made recently of it, to sampling and execute music.
It's a tool, made recently recently recently made recently of the music.
The Siftable here are acting sounds like lower, low-down, and bacteria.
Each of these has four different variations, and you can choose what to use.
You can put these sounds in a sequence to make it a compounds to your pleasure.
And then you just modify a sound," and a "sequence."
These are actually actually the way through the live, as the reverberation and file.
You attach it to a particular sound and then including it with it.
And then there are the general effects as time and volume, and you apply to the sequence.
Let's look at how it works.
Video: DM: We will start putting a basic in two Sift-"sequenc," we put in a seriously, we extend other base.
Now I put a blood line.
DM: DM: Now I add percent of ussions,
Video: DM: And I'm going to put the bacteria, so I can control the actual effect of the live.
Video: DM: I can fast the whole time by a sign or from a side or or the other.
DM: And I'm going to add the filter to the bottom to get more expression.
Video: DM: I can recombined the "voles."
So I don't have to planning it before, but I can sudden, make it longer or more corn.
And now, finally, I can left-hand the Siftable sequence on the left the Siftable "volume."
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is to build new interfaces of man-machine is to build new interfaces how our brain works.
And today, I had time to show you one of the results of this cord, and also some possibilities that we try to bring out of the lab to the lab about.
The conception I want to transmit is that it's coming this new generation of objects for interact with digital media to interact with digital media in the way we want to do it.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the time to talk to all of you.
I'm a writer.
From books is my profession but it's more than that, of course, of course, of course, of course, of course, of course, of the books is more of that.
It's also love and the fall of my life.
And I don't expect to be changed.
But, said that, something particularly happened in my life and in my life and in my career, which led me to realibrate with this work.
The particular thing is, I recently wrote this book, this biography called "Mangia, Prega, which, which is differently from my previous books, for some reason that the world and became a great sense, feelings, for some reason that has become a great feelings.
And the result is that everywhere you go to now, people treat me as if I was convicted up.
Really, it is true -- condition!
They are now all worried to me and they say, "You don't get fear you can't do it?
You don't you fear to continue to write for all life without being able to create a book that can care anybody?"
that can care about somebody?"
It's reassure, you know.
But it could go worse and over the worst of the 20 years ago, when I started to tell people -- I was a adolescent -- I was a written -- I was a writing.
I met the same reaction based on the fear.
And people would say, "You don't have to be able to happen?
You don't have fear the humiliation of rejects kill?
You don't have fear to do this mestise for all life without anything else is ever outside and die on a cumulation of beaming a bunch of hook with the mestimate of blood weather.
So, you know, you know,
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is: "Yes."
I have fear of all those things.
I always had fear.
And I have a lot of other things that people can't guess could be unto be.
Like the algae and other frightening.
But as I would write what I thought and ask me for the last last time is becaus?
Is it rational?
It's logical that anyone who should be frightened by a job that you feel born to do it.
But what is there is so particular in the impresumed creative to make us nervous health about the mental health care for other people who don't do it?
Like my father, for example, he was a chemistry engineer and I don't remember one time in his 40 years of activity in which the was asked if he was afraid to be engineer it?
It was never -- that block of John, how do it happen?
It didn't work like this, you know?
Onestly, chemistry engineers like group don't have certainly in the century, and the reputation of being alcoholed depress' depressive to be alcoholiday
We writers, we have enough this reputation and not only writers but creatives of every generally, we have this reputation of being enormously instable to mind.
And it is not another one that look at the content of the magnificent of the magnificent creative minds that only in the 2th century, and often die for them.
And the ones that don't have seem to be really disappeared by their women's dones.
Norman Mailer, before before the last die, in the last interviewed said, "Of my book killed me a little bit more extraordinary about the work of their own life.
But we don't drink when we feel this because we have these things like that, and we have all interior and accepted the notion of creativity and suffering the creativity are somehow to it, and the art, at the end of it, and the art, at the end of it, and will the enjoy to the enjoy and the argument.
And the question I want to ask all of today, I agree with this ide?
You get good at this thing -- because you know, even look at the distance of distance -- I don't go to me for nothing to this support --
I think it's hated to the way to that.
And I think it's also dangerous and I don't want to see the perpetuated in the next century.
I think it's better to encourage our great creative minds.
And of course, I know that in my case -- in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to start out to that becomes the obstacked the circumstances where I are in my career.
Of course -- I looked at it, I'm pretty young and I have about 40 years.
I have about four decades of work in me.
And it's very likely to do that I write about now and then it will be judged by the world as the work that came after the last book.
I'm going to be slave, because we're all more or less friends here -- it's probably the biggest successful is my greatest successful is my shoulder.
Oh, Gesus -- what I think!
You know this is the kind of thinking that leads a person starting to drink in the morning and I don't want to do it.
I would just go to do this work we do.
So, the question I got to do that?
And so I think, after a lot of reflecties, that the way to work and write that I think it was to create a psychological persent -- right?
I have to find a safe of security between me, which I'm writing about it, and my natural anxiety is what reaction is going to be able to get And, for all the time pattern on how I began to look through time, trying to find other societies to have better ideas and more healthier ideas and more healthier healthier and more health and more and more and more healthy healthcare and more healthy
how to help people create the inerent inerors of creative risks of creativity.
And that research led me to the ancient Greek and ancient Rome.
See because it goes back in circle and then back back.
In the ancient Greek and ancient Rome -- people didn't seem to believe that creativity came from men to humans, OK?
It was thinking that creativity was this spirit looks at the divine and that came to men from a few distant and unknown away, for reasons and unknown away.
The green was called these spirits of the "demoni" secreativity dies."
And he said, wonderful, wonderful, he believed to have a demone that elarge heavy to be a distant shed sheep.
The Romani were the same idea, but they called that kind of spirit without a genius
And that's great, because Romani didn't think a genius really didn't think a genius was somebody particularly smart.
They believed that a genius was this kind of divine that created was living in the walls of a artist, like Dobby, and who came out of the articket Dobby, and who came out to hide the job of the articket's job and modeling the result of that work.
Ecceptional -- there is the distance of which I talk -- that struck costruck that psychological costruck that protects you from your work.
And everybody knew that was so that it was so that it worked, right?
So the ancient artists were protpects from certain things, like for example, the too narcissnariith?
If your job was very exceptional, you couldn't take all the merged and all of them they were helped by this geniuse.
If your fail, it wasn't all of the blood your work failure.
Everybody knew it was your genius to be a incapable of it.
And so people han creativity in the Ocutter for a long time.
Then the Renaiss' reach, and it changed this big idea; we put the human being the middle of the universe over all the mist and mysteries and no longer space to the mysteries that write details writing the details to details from the divinity.
This was the principle of the humanity of rational humanity: and people began to think that creativity came from the idivid."
And for the first time in history, it started to referired to this or that artist as a genius to a person with the genius to a person with the genius.
And I have to tell you, I think it was a big mistake.
I think that allowed someone to believe someone a simple person to believe that being as a recipient as a source as the source and the source of all the mysteries and creativity, unknowable and ethium is a responsibility to give a strong sense of human.
It's like to ask someone to cut the sun.
It makes the ego and creates all these ingestious ingestiable ingestible on the performance.
And I think it was this pressure to have destroyed artists in the past 500 years.
And if this is true, and I think it is, the question becomes up, and it becomes it?
Can we do it different?
Maybe you can go back to a more ancient understanding of the relation between humans and creative mystery creative
Or maybe not.
Maybe we can't cut 500 years of thinking about rational thinking about a 18 minutes of minute think.
And you probably have people in the audience that would satissssuspects about the notion of the notion -- some, make people follow on their own own fair.
I probably won't convince you all about this thing.
But the question I want to ask is -- why not?
Why don't you think about this way?
Because it has more sense of everything that I've ever heard to explain the exasperants imprevedibility of creative process.
One thing that you ever have been trying to do something -- so, basically, all here -- you don't have rationally rationationally all here -- you don't have rationationally reward.
And, in fact, it can sometimes look completely paranormal.
I did this recently encounter-respective Ruth -- that was now 90 years old, but that was a poet-all life and said that during his childhood in the Virginia, worked out in the Virginia, and he was in the flightn-to-brought in the landscape of that, when a poem came from landscape.
He said it was like a fragorous tragic fles.
And that was rolling up to her from her landscape.
And he was going to get it, because he was doing the land under his feet.
He knew that we had one thing to do to that point and it was to do that, "Wait as a morne."
And it was going to go to the house and was following from this poem, and he wouldn't have any paper in and a wall of paper -- and a wall-fretext and grab it on the page.
Sometimes it couldn't be quite quickly, so it correct and running and running without getting to get to the house and the poem was going to go to the house and then she was going to breast through and she was going to break through the landscape and he would say, another poet a poet poet of it."
Then there were the time -- this piece I don't forget -- there were times when it was almost loss when it was almost loss -- right?
So, she was running at home and she was looking for card, and the poem was going through and grabbed a match right as he was going on, and he was like to fall with the other hand the step and the step off.
And he was the poem from the tail and remelted it in his body and the transmitted it on the page.
And in these cases, the poem would be on the perfectly and intact but the contrary to the last word at the last word at the first word at the first word at the first word at the first word at the first word at the last word of the first word at the last word for the first one, the word, the poem would be on the first one, the first word at the first word at the first word at the first time, from the last word of the first word and intact to the first one of these cases,
So when I felt like you -- it's just crazy, it's exactly the equal to my creative process.
I don't have my creative process -- I'm not a conduct of it.
I'm a mule, and my way of work is; wake up to the same orary every day and to work and get us and work and get us over and work and get us over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over the time.
But even I stand in my head and I was styed against that thing, at the time, sometimes.
And I imagine a lot of you have a face.
You know, even if work and work and ideas came from a certain source of a certain source I couldn't honestly know it.
And what is this thing?
And how can we relate to each way we don't get your head and make us not lose your head -- but do it stuck it?
For how it really, is the best contemporary for me -- I have is the musician -- which I interviewed different interviews years ago for a day.
We were talking about this, and you know, Tom, for the most life of the life of has been the incarnation of the artist res, trying to control it, managed to control these totally interior to control these totally interior interior interior of interior of the interior in the history.
But then I get up there, and one day when he was driving on a cartototoday, in Los Angeles, changed everything for him.
He was going fast, and everything is a very little bit of this melodia, which comes in his head of the way it does the inspiration, elusive and the halling and the aquenous, you know, wonderful and the wishes -- you know, wonderful and the wishes -- you know, it's not how to take it.
It has no piece of paper, it doesn't have a mate, it doesn't have a record.
So it starts to feel this kind of old anxious anxious in him -- "I'm going to lose and remark obsessed with this song al-sixed-up to this song alway.
I can't do it and I can't do it."
And instead of going to go to the panic stop.
And he did something completely new.
He just looked at the sky and said, "You know, I don't see that I'm driving?"
"Do you seem to write a song now?
If you really want to exist, you get in a more opporter when I can take care of you.
Other people you go to to to try to each other today.
You go to disturbing Leonard Coonard Cohen."
And his work process changed after that.
I don't work was dark as well as dark as a seed-like seeds.
But the process, and the heavy and the heavy was released when the genius, the genius that came out when the genius would have anything else to do problems and the freedoor and the freedom behind it where he was not to be an interior and tormented.
but he welse-like this peculiar bizarre bizarre -- and this external thing that was not Tom.
So how much the story started to change a little bit how I was working and already rescued me a time.
This idea, I saved when I was writing "Mangia, Prega, Amap and falling in one of those disperation where we all falling when we're working on something and we can't start thinking that it's going to be a disaster, that what will be the worst book never written it.
Not just bad at the worst book written --
And I started thinking about throwing this project.
But then I remember Tom who talked to the air, and I tried it.
So I got my face my face in the hand-a-dark and I would say my comments to a room a vacuum of the room.
And I said, "Look, you know, "Look, you both of this book will not be brilliant to not be bright to mind, right?
Because as I can see what I'm putting us all the way I haven't got to that.
So if you want it to be better and you have to introduce your side.
OK, but if you don't do it, you know what, you know, I don't get anything.
I'm going to write the same because it's my work.
And I would like to favor that was recorded to me to do my own particip," because -- at the end is like this, OK, OK, -- -- centuries in the North Africa people were raduned for the dances of the North Africa and dungone and drug music dances and the sacred and the hebely and the heba.
And they were always magnificent because the dancers were professionals, and they were fantastic.
But every time, rary, making something happens, and one of these artists became actually transmitted in --
And I know what I talk about, because I know I know that you've seen it all of it, a certain point, a lost way.
It was like the time stopping and the dance, and he was going through a kind of portal and wasn't doing anything from the sunlight, as 1,000 nights before, but everything is flighted.
And suddenly not only appeared as a human human being.
But it turns out from the divince and below the divinity.
And when this next to the time, the people knew what he was, they called it with his name.
They took the hands and began to singing, "Allah, Allah, God Dio, God, God, God, God, Go."
That's God, you know,
Curious note -- when the More invader the south of the Spain -- they took this habitude with them and the ready to change in the century in the century by "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Oh, it, ol," which you can still feel in the fellow folks or in the flamens.
In Spain, when a artist has made something impossible and magic -- "Allah, you know, Allah, magnified, you know, it's a lot, excepting -- a lot.
And it's great because we need it.
But the problem comes the next day later, for the baller's the ballery and discovers that are 11 in the morning of Martedday and discover that the Dod is not there.
It's just a dead of a big dead to the knees, and maybe not it will never be able to the treat the height.
And maybe nobody will give the name of God still as it down, and what do you have to do with the rest of his life?
It's difficult.
This is one of the most painful re-pain-free re-life re-life.
But perhaps it doesn't have to be so angotiating, if you can not believe it, you know, the most amazing aspects of your being being being being from you to yourself.
But just believes that you have been given you from a un-imaginable source of this team of your life that you have to get to someone else when you have.
And, you know, if we think this whole way it changes.
And so I started thinking about it, and it is certainly as I thought about it for different months during the work that I would have a little bit of the public -- the dangerous spectaces;
And what I have to tell me when I feel electrized myself to be electrized by this is, not being fear.
Let me just just your work.
It goes to your side, any of your side, any of your partner.
If your work is dance, you know, you get your work is dance.
If the divine, I assurd genius decide to let some kind of wonders, for a few things that are wonderful, for a moment through your effort through your efs, then "O!"
Over the same as your dance.
And "Oh, you know, you know.
I think I think I got to teach it.
"H!" to yourself, even for the human had and testing and text talks to give you all the talks to give you all the time.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: O!
And as you know I've talked about some of these projects on the human genome on what it can mean, and what discovery new genes.
We're starting a new percorso: we started to digitalize biology and now starting from that digital code we are coming into a new biology of biology and by doing life.
We always tried to ask the big questions.
"What is the life?" It's something that many biologists I think they tried to understand at various level.
We tried different approaches, reducing the minimum of the approach.
We're about 20 years ormous.
When we sequenced the human genome was treating of the world of the biology world of the biology the computer.
Now we ask our: can we regenerate life, or create new life from this digital universe from this digital univer?
This is the map of a small organism, the Mycoplasma genitalium, which is the species from the smallest genome between what they can authorable to the lab in the lab of the smaller genome --
And we tried to reduce the genome to create one more smaller.
We can get a hundred genes of the genes of the about 500 genes that are here.
But when we look at the metabolic map to his metabolic map to the note.
Belilights this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes we can eliminate each time, it's very unlikely that this can bring a cellull.
So we decided that the only way to progression was to synthesize this chromosomes so we could modify the components to bring some of these fundamental questions.
And so we started the adventure of the "Can we can synthesize a chromoso?"
Can the chemistry to make these great molecules that we never could create before you?
And in a degree -- can we make a chromosound?
A chromosome is just a piece of chemistry of chemistry of the chemistry of the inert material.
The speed that we can digitalize life is growing up to exponential res.
Our ability to write the genetic code, aging progression and fairly slowly slowly, but it's getting better.
And our latest results, the bringing up a exponential curve.
We started more than 15 years ago.
The process has required a lot of passes -- starting with a bioetic review before we started the first experiments.
But we found that DNA is very difficult.
There are tens of thousands of cars in the world that little DNA segments, the long long of 30 to 50 letters to 50 letters and it's a degenerative proces: the most selection is longer than the cheap is the more errors we have to be there.
So we had to develop a new method, to assemble these fragments and correct the error.
And this was our first attempt to start from PhX 174.
It's a little virus that kills bacteria.
We designed the fragments, effects the report of mistakes, and we got a DNA of about 5,000 letters.
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemistry of chemistry and we put it into bacteria bacteria started reading this genetic code and to produce particles.
The particles have been released by cells, they came back and they have destroyed the E.
I talked about recent with members of the petrolifes say that they certainly understood this model.
They have more than you.
We believe this is a situation where the software can really build his own hardware in a biological system.
But we wanted to do the biggest things in big.
We wanted to build the entire chromosome.
They're more than 580 thousand miles the letters of genetic code.
So we thought we built it in the size of virus, so we can change the way to change the cassets to understand what the components are the living cells.
The design is crucial, and if we start with digital information, in a computer, these must be very accurated.
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995, the standard was of a mistake for every 10 thousand mile for every 10 thousand the mile
We found it, resequencing it, 30 errors. If we had the original sequence we never had to be able to do it work.
One part of the process is designing down to the 50 letters that are overwhelmed with all the other segments of 50 letters to build under-lead under-smaller to build underunits.
We try to be one here.
You probably have you read that we put the light.
So let's think this is we have a genetic code based on four letters: A, C, G, and T.
Three of those letters together about 20 adminiop-love bears, and there's one specific order to bear for every aminactive beams for every minoid.
So we can use the genetic code for writing words, thought.
What we did at the beginning was authography.
Some have been dolphushes from the fact that it wasn't poemy.
We designed these sat these sat to just put them together with encies.
There are enzyme that repair them and put them together.
And we started to assemble the parts, starting with five to seven miletter from five to seven miletter to 24 milt sitting at 24 miles that when to 24 milt letter.
Anybody who has these chunks in the abundance so that we can sequended up to making a very robodies -- as you will see in a minute.
We're trying to automatically the process.
So this looks like the tabellon a baskets.
When we get these very long-four-h-mile cheap segments are not going to grow up in the E.
You get the limits of the modern tools of the modern biology --
So we looked at the other mechannel.
We knew another mechanism called an recombination of homology, which is useful to repair the DNA to repair the DNA to unique the DNA in unique.
Here's an example of that.
This organism, Deinococcus radioduction, it can absorb three million rads of radiation.
You can see the sodanger as his chromosome, you can see in the upper background.
In 12 -- 24 hours comes assembled exactly as it was before.
There are thousands of organisms that have been able to do it.
These organisms can be completely.
They can live under empty.
I'm absolutely sure life existing in space, and you move to the new rich and get out of water.
NASA has showed that this happened.
This is a picture of the molecule that we built using these processes -- by just using the lights to the design appropriate of the design segments to inserious chunks.
The lights carefully.
This picture is not taken with a picture taken with a electron microscope, but with a microscope with a regular microscope.
It's a molecule so big we can see it with a slightly slightly slightly slightly reading
These are pictures that they cover a period of six seconds.
This is the publishing that we did a little time ago.
It's about 580,000 letters of genetic code.
It's the biggest molecule of a defined structure that never created by man.
It has a molecular weight to 300 million ones.
If we spent it with a paper atter 10 without spaces, you want to 142 pages to only get this genetic code.
Now, how do we work work? How can we activate it?
Of course, you get a virus is a guy from a guy who are a game by kids.
It's a little bit more complicated when you use bacteria as the bacteria as the bacters.
It's simpler even when it's eucariot cells as we can just extract the nucleus and put it up another one -- which is basically the process of cloning.
In the bacterium is the chromosome, instead integrated into the cell but we have recently showed that we can do a complete trapiant traplant trapiant of a cell and active.
We purified a background, by a microbial special species.
The two are different as men from the topies.
We added a few genes in the way we can decide what to choose for this chromosoon.
And then I skip with enzyme as much as to kill all proteins.
And when we put it in the cell was stupending -- and you will open our graphic sophisticatos -- the new chromosomes went inside the cell.
And we were really thinking we couldn't go to that, but we tried to get more in it.
This is one of the world's greatest mechanisms of evolution.
We found that a lot of species have added a second or a third chromosome, I add in a second thousands of new tracks to a second thousands of new trats to that species.
So who think about evolution as a gene gene to evolution that you don't understand a lot of the biology.
There are enzymes called the restrictions, the DNA enzyme enzyme enzyme --
The chromosomes that was in the cell doesn't have one.
The cell pha-chromosomes we put inserito--to----to-the cell pha-a-up cell pha-to-the chromosome.
It turns out the other way that the expressed, and it recognized, and we found it with only the cell and the new cell and the new cell of the cellula and the new chromo.
It has become blue because of the genes we have inserved.
And in a short of time, all the characteristics of a species have been lost and been, and it transformed the whole software that we put in the cell.
All the proteins have changed, membranes have changed, and when we read the genetic code equide what we have transferred you award.
Now, this may seem to genetic alchemics, but by altering DNA software we can change things in a pretty substantial ways.
Now, I explained that here is not about genesis -- but the progress from three million and a half million evolution, and I already said that maybe we're going to create a new version of the Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosion of the Cambrian explosion procal.
Why do I do that?
I think it's quite obvious when we think about our needs.
We're going to be six and a half billion people in the next 40 years.
Just to give an example of the example: I was born in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for each existing in 1946; 40 years, there will be four of it.
We're going to have problems now to find food, fresh and clean-water, medicinal and drinkle for six and a half billion people.
It's going to be harder to do it for nine billion.
We use more than five billion carbon coal, over 30 billion carbon barrel.
That means a hundred million barrels a day.
When we try to find biological processes to or biological processes to replace them, it's going to be a huge challenge of me.
We have to keep the whole of the CO2 emission of these materials that ends up in the atmosphere.
At the day, because of the scientific discoveries around the world, we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I like to think that are designed for the future.
The electric industry has only a dozen about components, and think about how many different things have come out of it.
Our limits here are the basic data from reality and our imagination.
We have the techniques, because of these rapids of quick synthesization, able to create what we call combinatory genomics.
We can build a big robot that can produce a million robot,
Think of processing these 20 million genes of different genes to try to optimize the processes to produce either either either vaccines, we can change it, we can change because of a little team, and create more biology than the last 20 years of science.
And it's just a selection selection.
We can choose for survive, a chemistry or fuel fuel or fuel.
This is a few software of some software programmed that we're working on to be able to sit and design species to the computer.
Well, we don't need to know how they will do.
We know exactly what their genetic code --
We're focusing on the fourth of quarter generation.
You've seen you also see you that you get ethanol from the gry was a mouth.
We have carbon depending on the third generation will be going to use enough to the higher than the top of the higher as the either either either as many of the treatment or different types of thrown or thrown out of the top of the higher than the either ones that will come up with the higher than the either than the either than the either as the eight generation will be using from the higher than the top of the higher as the top of the value of the higher than the smoke as the top of the top of the top of the top
But the only way biology can have a great impact without increasing impact without increasing the cost of food and limiting the cost of food and limiting the CO2 cells that we're working on for designing cells that we're working on for designing cells that we can reach this purpose, and we can get this purpose --
The sunlighting together with the CO2 is a methodo, but in our discoveries around the world, we found different methods.
This is a organism that we described in 1996.
It lives in the deep ocean to about 2,500 feet to the eboiling temperature in the water.
It creates meter from the CO2 molecular hydrogen, as a source of energy.
We're trying to understand if we can put the CO2 CO2 that can easily be transportated by tubes, converting that CO2 in order to drive this process.
So short we think we could be able to increase what the question is, what the life," is the life."
Exactly. If you can't do it from TED, where can you do it?
It would become a main source of energy.
And in the other way we are working on to use the same metods to create the instantanes.
You've seen this year with influence, we're always behind a year and a dollar a year, and with a dollar buck vaccine.
I think what I think you can change in construction in the ancient of a various advance.
Here's how the future could start to look and changing, now, evolution, accelerating evolution with bacteria -- evolution with bacteria -- archaeucarian arch, and finally cells.
We are so much from improving people.
Our purpose is to make a way of living enough to try and do it. Thank you very much.
First of all I'm going to show you the fastest possible possible possible to the most quick job, the new technology that we took the Microsoft water, and the most quisition. This is Seadragon.
It's a environment, where you can interact with is at the local level that remote with a huge amount of visual data.
We're seeing a lot of gigabyte from photographs with a kind of digital zoom and continue, for a very quick bread and continue, for a speed panoramic zones, so we want to see images as we want to see imagery as we want to see imagery of images as we want to see images as we are seeing images as we want to see imagining a lot of gigabyte and I can see here and lots of digital and lots of tune and
And it doesn't matter how big the amount of information that we see is the amount of information that we see is the big amount of data or images.
Most of them are digital photographs, but this is a scale from the Bioteum from the Bioteum and rewing in the Congress, and rewing in the 300 megapixel.
It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that the predicts the predictions of a system like this is the number of pixels on your screen at any time. It's also a very flexible architecture --
This is a whole book of data, you know, not imagining data.
This is the Dickens. Each Dickens. Every colonna represents a capitule.
To show you that it's just about testing and not imagines, we can do something like this, to see really it's a real representation of the text text of test, not a picture.
It could be a little artificial way to read a little electronic book.
You don't advision.
This is a more realistic. This is a number of "The Guardian example of the Guardian example of the Guardian.
Every picture is the beginning of a section.
And it really gives you the pleasure of the experience of reading the version of a magazine or a fifth of a magazine or a fifth of a meeting.
We also did something with the cornly of this number in the Guardian ism of this number of the Guardian
We created a publicity advertise to resolution -- much more higher than what you use in a normal commercial -- and we put you in a normal content content.
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile, you can see here.
Or other models, or even specific specific techniques.
And this really demonstrates some of these ideas to get the limits of space on the screen.
We hope this lady putting the pop-up to the few pop-up to other pop-up needs.
Of course, the map is one of the obvious applications for this kind of technology.
And I don't want to lose time, if I don't want to lose time, if we don't say we have contributed to this field.
These are all the streets in the United States overlesths over a New NASA geospatial image of the NASA jum.
So now we're going to go to something else.
This is now from the vision on the Web; you can see it to see it.
This is a project called Photosynth, which two different technologies.
One is Seadragon and the other is a very interesting visual computer visual computer-interesting computer that by Noah Snavely, a student, with Steve Seitz US Steve Seitz UWashington, with Steve Seitz UWashingt: A great collaboration. A great collaboration.
And it's from the web, gestion from Seadragon.
You can see it when we do this guy of schermate, where we can move from one image to the other and have this kind of experience to put in the last resolution of it.
But the spacecraft of the images here has actually a meaning.
The tages of computer visualization of computer have recorded these images together, so that they correspond to the real places where the real places that you can put them on the the lab Grassi on the Mountains on Montagne Roccious Montagne Roccious Mountains -- you see the elements of a stable slide-stable things have been connected to space.
I don't know if I have time to show you some other environment.
There are a lot more space.
I want to spend directly to one of the notion set of Noah-proto-one data, which is from a previous protoy of Photosynthosynthium, that we did the first last summer -- to show you what I think is really the key behind this technology, Photosynth. And it's not necessarily so much obvious to watch the environments that we put in the Web.
We had to worry about the legal aspects and so forth.
This is a reconstruction of Notther Dame images Flickr. Basttypes pre-Dame images in Flickr. Basttypes in and you get images of the camps, other of the camps, other of the campps, and I get imagined to the argue that has been discovered to this model.
So they're all taken from Flickr and have been linked to this spacecraft in this way.
And you can get this simple kind of thing.
You know, I never thought I wish I never never thought I was going to work for Microsoft.
It's very gratifying this kind of acvast here.
I think you can see that this is a lot of different types of types of fell phones to those of the maphones to those SLR, a meaningful number of these environment.
And if I can get the most strange to look for those strange smaller.
Many are blocks from face, etc.
Something here is a series of photographs -- there it is a series of photographs.
This is a poster of Notber Dame record.
We can move from the poster to the physics of this environment.
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment. This is now taking data from everyday -- from collective interviewing with the ground, from visual point of view -- and connects all the data together.
All those pictures become connected together, the higher than the parts.
You have a model of the land interest that emerge.
Think about this as a prolunch of Stephen Lawler on the Earth, virtual Earth virtual
It's something that grows in complexity as the people are using it, and the advantages for who use, and the advantages increase with use.
Their photos are branch with meters to other people.
If someone comes the idea of the idea of delivering all these things saying, my picture of the Caths of Notber Dame suddenly has cut up all those data, and I can use it as a point of ingrespot, in that metapuniverse, using the photos of everyone and have a social experience of a different kind of cross-hand cross-red experience of the red type of red-red red red red type of the type of red bits of the data.
Of course, a consequence of all of this are very elaborate models of every interesting part of the earth -- collecting not only aeries and airplane and from images and satellite images and similar pictures and similar memory and websatellite memory and the satellite images and the satellite images of all the interesting pattern.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Do I understand good? What is you know what your software will have to do is that at a certain point, in the next few years, all the shared photographs from anyone in the world are going to be basically connected together?
BAA: Yeah. What is doing is doing doing it discover it.
It's creating hyperlink if you want to do it, between images.
And it's doing it in the content of the imagines.
And it gets very interesting if you think about the wealth of the seed-up information, that many of these images are going to be able to do it.
As a research of images on the Web, you know, a phrase and the text on the Web has a lot of information about images.
Now, what happens if that picture you connect to all your picture?
So the amount of interconnection and the amount of interconnection and the amount of wealth that comes to really huge onto me. It's a classical classical effect.
CA: Blaise, it's really incredible.
BAA: Thank you very much.
One of the main pleasant when you travel and one of the delipthnographic research is the way that live between those who didn't forget the antic of the old traditions, between who is the past in the wind, the stone of the plants.
You know, the shamans are still beyond the Milky Lattea, or that the myths of old Inuit is that the Inuit is that the Inuit is that in Himalaya, the budges still inherent the spider of Dharm, to remember the importance of the Dharm of the Dharm -- and that the idea that the world that we don't exist, but in absolutely a model of reality,
the following of a particular set of choices adaptative that our stunk stunk has made -- good or a lot of generations.
And, of course, we all share the basic tracts.
We all hidden we have a procreate.
We are subjects to the beginning of this.
We have to deal with the deaths of deaths and we don't surprised if we stand --
We all have an art.
What it hits the cang of the canzon, the rhythm of every culture.
It doesn't matter that are the Kaith's forest or the Kaisus or the follows of Haiti, or the the desert of the Kenya -- the Kenya Sepentrion Kenya Sepentrion of the Sahara.
He was my company of travel in the desert a month ago, or a month ago, or a hallevator of Everest, the Mt. Everest, the mother of the world.
All of these people teach us that there are other ways of thinking about ways of thinking about how to move in the world.
And if you reflect a second, it's a concept that it can give you hope.
Inside, the cultures of the world creating a spiritual of the world creating a spiritual and cultural that goes on the planet and is important for the well-being of the planet as the the douter as biosphones.
And you can think about this ran as a culture as a ethnoxixy and you can define the ethnoxified the total sum of all the concepts, dreams, ideas, inspirations, ideas, ideas, inspirations, by the human imagination from the human imagination from the the human imagination of the consciousness.
The ethnox-fhere is the fantastic pathrimony.
It's the symbol of what we're and what we can be in how quisities.
And because biosphere has been consumed as much as it was as much as it happened to ethnoxious and unfortunately, too much faster.
No biologist, for example, it would say 50 percent of all species is about the bears or is about the bears of the extreme -- in the most apocalittic field -- in the field of biological diversity -- and you don't get to the most optimistic diversity -- that the culture of cultural diversity.
The indicates of all of course, is obviously, the language of language.
When you're born 6,000 languages on this planet.
One language is not only compost from a vocabulary or from a series of gramatical.
One language is the price of human spirit of the human spirit is the price of human spirit is the price of human spirit is the price of the human spirit --
It's the half with which the animation of every culture comes in the material.
Each language is a forest of the mind, a spiritual possibility of spiritual possibility.
And of those 6,000 languages, as we sit at least half the half is not much more surrying in the ears of the children.
They don't get the children, the kids, which means to less you get something, which is already died.
What is the most sad than being the silence, of being the last talk to a language, of being the last talk a language, not how to transmit the wisdom of address or or to anticipate the promise of the children?
This orring is the one of the world every two weeks a few weeks a bunch and a mur mudies and leads with the last few weeks and a language in the ultimate language.
And I know someone to say, "Is it not the best way?
The world would not be a better place if we were all the same languages?" Benism, then we talk all yoruba. Let's talk about a meant -- let's talk about a meant --
We talk about the kogis.
You'll see a tract thing that means we can't talk about their language.
I would like to give you a journey through the ethnosfera;
a little journey in the ethnox-fhere to give you a above what we're losing here.
Many of us forget that when I say "different ways of existing in the existing ways of existing to the different ways of exists.
Let's take for example, this Barasana, in Amazony in Seprional, the popular anaconda, that creates the midden of the layer in the midst of the midst of the midden snake of the midden sacries.
It's a popular popular that is not able to distinguish the blue color because the celeste is identified in the forest time is identified in the forest time that the people dipend the population.
They have a strange language and a matrimonial rule, called ""exogamicistic languages -- you have to marry a different language.
And it has roots in the mitologic past the particular one is that in these extremely family, where you talk about six or seven languages -- the languages is that in the mystic matriages.
They just just listen to and then start talking about.
We take one of the most interesting tribes with the most interesting tribes with the Waorani of Ecuador nords, an incredible popular Ecuador had the first contacts in 1958.
In 1957 mission have tried to have tried a factorients.
They took the picture of the top of the photographs that they would reach them in a few retreatment that this popular forest that this popular forest has never seen anything than two-dimensional bi-dimensional.
They picked the pictures from the ground, they fit to the research of shape, not finding nowhere, they have to reach the diavule, and they killed the diavulate the diavulate and killed the five mission with the lances.
But the Waorani didn't kill they just dig the straniers'
They kill them in each other.
54 percent of the death was caused by their own own themselves.
We are risked to eight generations and we found two of natural death-natural death cases and when we insisted for saper, they had a little agreed that he died that he died him -- and then they killed him -- and then they killed it again.
The hunters were able to recognize the animal urine from 40 steps and recognize the species.
In the early 1980s, I was assigned a really interesting job when my professor of Harvard asked me if I wanted to go to Haiti to intruphic society and Tonton Macoutes, and the Tonton Macoutes, and I got to get the basic power of Dubum and the Tonton Macoutes, and I got the velended up to use the velended up with the velended to use to do the velended up with the velended to Haiti to be able to Haiti to get to get
To make sense to miraculous myth to understand the Voodoo culture and that Voodoo is not black black up.
It's pretty much a metaphor vision of the world.
Very interesting.
If you ask you to tell the great religions of the world, what would you say about it?
Christianity, Islam, Buddismo, etc.
A continent is always left outside, thinking that sub-Saharan Africa has no religious ffalling and Voodoo is not religious religious disdisdisdisrate of these very profound religious concepts of the slavery of the back.
What makes you interesting your voodoo is the intent relationship between life and death.
So you live in the spirits.
The spirits can be invocated by the Grande Aqua, they respond to the rand-report the dance of the vive and replace the time is that for a short actime-up to a short actime-up to the follow the following is the deal.
For this voodooisters like the dooisters go to a church of God.
We give us in the temple, and we become God."
And from the moment you can be possite you can drive you, how can you get you all several you have?
So you look at these incredible events, you follow your voodoo in the state of tracking tips that touch you get a rather demonstrated demonstration of the mind when it's catalyzed in a state of the mind when it's catalyzed in a very excitement of the power when it's catalyzed in a very exciting.
And all the people who I lived the most extraordinary of the Sierra Nevade Santa Marck-Nevade Santa Marck-March in the Colombia of secentrion --
It turns out the ancient civilization that once they lived on the careboards that once they lived on the careers in the conquist, the population of the conquista, the population of the carblood of the float on the float the floor.
In a continent macchieved of blood -- this popular has never been conquisted by the shagnowles.
Over today are government from a click -- but their trained is decide-of.

For this time, they get accultural to the values of their society, valuable values that they previous their prayers and only their prayer to the cosmic balance, or to say the Ecological balance.
At the end of this incredible beginning, they have been suddenly taken out and for the first time in the age of 18 years, they see an alba. And in that actime-of the first blood -- when the Sun is the sun gun, the sun guns, all of the beautiful landscape is all his own theory conference the whole blood -- this is a step and says, ""You'll be a step behind and say, """"Heel is a step behind a step behind a step behind a step a step a step behind husushurch of the de" of the de"
"Hell? I have detail.
It's stupend. Now it's going to be protect."
You call them the largest brothers and say that us, the minder brothers of the world.
This level of intuition is extremely important.
When we think about India's populations and the environment, we put Rousseau and the old story of the wild wild -- which is a concept of the noble or maybe we met Thoresu and say these people are close to the Earth in the simplest of us.
The people are not not feeling about the unlike the human feeling from our algic from our algia.
There's no space for these things in malaric stages in the Asmat wind gelies in the gelies and the rituals that the Earth is not about the concept of the Earth is not about the concept of being conscious -- the concept that the Earth can only live because it's more sub-to-conscious intuition.
What does it mean?
It means that a girl of the Ande who grows and believing that the mountain is a spirit Apu that will be a propelled human being being propelled and it will have a very different relationship with the mountain or a mountain or a Montana growing boy that is growing that is growing that is a mountain is a mountain a mountain is shelting a shelter of rock to be did.
which is the dimort of a spirit or a little bit of mineral is irrelevant.
What is interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between the individual and natural world.
I grew up in the forests of the Columbia British forforests had to be cut.
And this one has resilized me from my friends who believe that the forests are believing that forest is the Hukukukukukuk and the beat the wild and the beat the time north of the world, becomes north of the world, berits that we deal with the Huky jay.
If you start looking at that these cultures can actually create different reality, you can actually start understanding some sense-discovered sense-discovered sense-discover discover this plant.
I took this picture to aprile in the nordoctorky in the nordoctor.
Maybe some of you have heard about the ayahuas, the most powerful psychoptic repertoo.
What makes the ayahuase, is not the potential for the drug -- but his elaboration. It's made by two elements. It's made by two elements.
From a lian lian lia bunch of beta-carboline, harmine and harmine molinogene.
And I take the only plant plant is a shelf that alters a little bit of consciousness, but it's measured with the leaves of a coffee family, but it's measured with the coffee of the coffee is Psychotridis.
This planta planta pine-five-like plants, a methoxyptamine-5, methoxyptamine-5, methoxyltryptamine-to-fixed plant.
If you ever see the Yanomami tiring the substance that are doing from a different set of species, which is a different set of the species, which is methoxyptoxyyphthoxypty methoxyptoxywame.
Tiring that pole on the hidden is a little bit like to be disappeared by a fire-eyed couple, and land on a sea of electricity.
I was often with my professor, Richard Evan Shultes, the man who scatended the psychologic with his discoveries in the 1930s, with his discoveries in the '30s.
Second my text can be classify these triamines as hallucinogeny because if you're made not telling anyone to be hallucinated.
You can just be possible to assume to the bears that denial denial chemicals that denial den.
Now is the beauty beta-carbolin-carboline that are inbicught of the MAO, the same kind of need to potentiate triptamines. The question is the kind of a 80,000 species of plants, how these people do these people find plants, how these people are going to find two deathologists in this book, you if you put in this book,
We use the great euphemisism of proof of the proof of the proof infruttly.
But if we ask Indians to tell us to the plants tell us about it."
What does it mean?
This tribe the Cofan, has 17 variety of the ayahuas, which distinguished in the forest, and that in our eye and that our eyes would reception.
If we ask them how they stable their poccksonomy will tell us how to stable they stabies us how to stable they were not all y?" I said, "No."
The solution is, you take the 17 variety in a night of the moon and each will be with a different tape.
And so this is not a laurea to Harvard, but it's much more interesting than to contare the stams.
Now, the problem is that also the ones of us that are also the ones of us who have to give you the Indian populations are going to be pushing them in the history of our history of our real world and pass to beyond our real world --
In fact, the X-century -- 300 years, it will not reminded for its wars or its innovations and technology, but rather like the age of the age of technology, but rather like the age of the destruction of the diversity and culture of the planet. Now the destruction of the planet. Now the problem is not the change.
All culture through the century has been involved in a dance for new possibility of life.
And the problem is not technology.
The Sioux have not being Sioux when they put from the ark and fresh as they put from the horse and fresh as Americans have not to be Americans when they put away from horse to and calessly.
It's not the change or technology that threatening the ethnosfer. It's the power.
The last fly of the domination.
And if you give a look at the world, you will find that these are not culture destined to disappear.
I have living creatures and dynamics out of existence from existence existence of identifiable to adaptation and adapting.
I'm going to be disbowing in the pathy of the Peng --

Or in Yanomami, in Yanomami, are the diseases that have come with the discovery ol.
If we move on the Turbet, where I'm doing a lot of research, where I'm doing a lot research, you'll see the harmest-domination.
As you know the genocide genocide of a popular popular the universal level, but celebrated at the universal level of a population, not only is not just conditioned -- not only is not conditioned -- but celebrated in certain environments, because it makes part of the strategy of development.
And you can't understand the Tibet until you start the beginning.
I have the 6,000 miles from Chengdu in China in Western China through the Western Tibet through the Tibet south-line, but only came to Lhasa young line, but only came to Lhasa statistics that we feel about it.
6,000 monuments in the policy and cenergy.
1.2 million people killed by military military in the Cultural.
The father of this guy was ascrited to the Panchen Lama.
which means that it was killed at the time of the Chinese invasion of the Chinese invasion of the Chinese invasion that it was killed at the Chinese invasion of Chinese invasion of the Chinese invasion of the Chinese invasion of the Chinese invasion of the Chinese invasion of the Chinese invasion of the Chinese invasion of the Chinese invasion of the Chinese invadesion.

The Tibet can be inhurtable -- but the spirit of the people is to be inhurted.
At the found, everything comes up to a choice.
We want to live in the world of the world's world of the world's world to act the policy world of diversity?
The great antiropologist Margaret Mead, before we die said that his greatest fear of our our own fear of the world, not only we'll see the whole legal legal of the human imagination is that we can see the whole legal of thinking about the thought, but one day we get up to a dimentioning on the way that there were other possibilities.
And it's humbling our species is existed for 600,000 years.
The Neolitic revolution that has given us the agriculture, which has made us to be decreended us to the deaths the prounting of the classroom with the prounting of the classgerarchia of specialization, and we talk about 10,000 years ago.
The modern industrialized world has 300 years.
That sharks a story is not suggests that we have the answers to all the challenges that we have to deal with in the millennia.
When these cultures of the world of the world is asked what to be human, they respond to to be human, they respond to 10,000 different voices.
And it's in these answers that we all risk we will be what we are, a kind of awful species that have to make the people all the people and all the gardens and all the gardens can flow. And there are great times.
I took this picture of the north of Baffin, when I went to the Baffin, when I went to black the whales with the Inuit, and this man, Olaya, he told me the wonderful story of his grandfathern of his grandfather's id.
The canadese is not always gentlemen with the Inuit and in the '50s, for our sounds to our earlier our sounds in colonies.
The grandfather of this man refused to go there.
The family by the family, I took all the arms, and all of his attemptes.
You have to know that the Inuit don't have the cold -- they exploited.
The slittles were made of the gin was made of the fish packaging in the caribs.
The grandfather of this man didn't have intimit from the night or the basis or from the basis.
It's smoking in the way, and he hoted the pantalong, and flew in their hand. When the 10 is a hand. When I did the failed them creating a moon.
It has pushed on the dots of this caccept and when I was solid, killed a dog --
He brought the dog and created a brille, with the bright shelf with a slittle, and put another dog on the flag, and it has gone on the flag.
We want to talk about horse? [Ris] And this, in different ways, [Applausisi] is the symbol of the Inuit and the resilience of the Inuit and all the people in the world.
In 1999 1999 the government canadese has been rejected to Inuit for the total control of the largest territory of California and the Texas put together.
It's their new pathria. It's called Nunavut.
It's a indipendent. They Controllate all the resources.
One of the wonderful example of how a national national state can reconcilit with his people.
And, finally, I think it's pretty obvious to who are at least who we had to these remote areas of the planet, realized that they are not remote to the remote that they are not remote to the way --
For someone is home.
They represents the human imagination that they go to the dawn of the time for themselves. And for us all of these children, as the dreams of our children, become part of the hopefully as the hgeography of hope.
First, we have National Geographic we are convince that politicians will never come to not.

Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book I hope to call other than you have heard and I'll try to look at some links, in case you don't notice them.
I want to start with what I call the official dog."
The official official of what?
The official dog's office of all the Western industrial society is the official official -- "If we want to be wealthy citizens' "The way to do it is to massize.
The reason is the reason for the liberty is in the fact that freedom is in the same a value -- is useful, useful, for human beings.
On the other one is the fact that if we are free, each of us can act to do everything that masses our well-being, no one deciding in the name of ourselves --
The way to masses the freedom is to be like choice.
More people are free, more they are free, and the bigger is their freedom, more than the freedom, is their well-being.
This is, I think it's so deeply radicated in the society that nobody would dream to put it in doubt.
And it's also deeply rooted in our lives.
I'm going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible.
This is my supermarket. It's not particularly big.
I lose a simple note about the conditional conditional conditions.
In my supermarket there are 175 conditions, without context the 10 variety of beextracting and 12 balsamic balapics that you can buy you to buy a huge number of conditions in the scious increase that nobody of the 175 reads is of your own 15-already has to your own own mind.
Here's what the supermarket.
Then you go to the store of electronic to buy a stere: CD, radio, CD, radio, plast, radio, plast, the legal store --
And in this single electric store, there's a big number of audio.
We can make six and a half million different combinations using the components that there are in one negoti.
You have to admit that there is a lot of choice.
Other bedroom: the world of communications.
Once time, when I was a child, you could get all the phones, to the phones, to the packed phones, to the Bell.
He was the phone was not bought it.
One consequence of that, in the other one was that the telephone is that the telephone is not a make.
These times are gone.
We have a variety of telephone of the phone cell phones, especially between cellular cellular cellphones.
Here's the cellular cellphones in the future.
My favorite is the in the middle, reader MP3, cut the nose of the hidden crying, and strong the cry' crize.
If you don't have seen it in the store under the house below the house below you, you're pretty well certain that will come to here.
And what happens is, people on the end of the people enter in the stores and ask the question. And you know what the answer is "No."
You can't buy a cellphone that doesn't do too much things.
So, in other aspects of life that are much more important than the water, you can be the same explosion of choices.
Life is not going to happen to be in the United States you go from the doctor, and the doctors what you have to do.
Instead, you go from the doctor, and the doctor, and he said, "Oh, you can do A, or B, "Be these benefits and these riskys" "Buts," "Buts" and these risks. What do you want to do you that?"
You say, "Dr. Dr. Dr. What would I have to do that?"
And the doctors says, "In the benefits and these risks, and these risks and the ""Look and these risk."
"What do you want to do that?"
And you can rebate it, "Dr. if she was me, what do you do?"
And the doctor: "But I'm not leise."
The result of the malator of the malato," expression that makes it look like a beautiful thing.
But in fact, it's not a shift and the responsibility to make decisions, by someone who knows somebody's doctor, to someone else knows -- and almost certainly it's sick -- and so I don't know -- and so not in conditional to make the patient for decisions of the patient for the patient decision-making.
There's a huge marketing of drug products --
But if we can't buy them, why do you make them pulls them at it?
The answer is that they want to domest, we call the doctor's doctor.
Something about so important as it is our identity is a question of choice, as you see in this journal is about choice, we don't want to force. We don't want to force. We don't want to force.
And we can reinvention ourselves as many times we can reinvent.
That means every morning in the risking, you have to decide that kind of person you want to be.
I received to the family, a time perspective perspective, uncounted almost for anyone -- it was that we married the most preme possible possible and it was going to be able to do the most premious possible for the most premious possible for the most preme possible.
The only real choice was with when, not when I walk up, and not when I walk up what to do later.
Over the day, it's really going to play with.
I think of a very smart students very smart and I do 20 percent in less work.
And not because they're less dbrilliant, not because they're less diligents.
But why I'm implemented to ask is, "Could I marries or no?
"Would I have to marries late? I have to think before the care?"
I'm just order.
And they try to answer these questions, even if this implementing not completing the companies that I assegment not to get a bel vote to my exame.
And they must really ask it. They are important questions.
Now, the work, we're lucky, as Carl underlymtolineavy because technology allows us to work every day, from every day, from every day, from every corner, from the Hotel Randole.
Have parents, there's a corner, and I don't tell nobody nobody what WiFi works.
I don't say that, because I want to use me.
What does this amazing liberty of choice we have about the work we have about the work? Is it that we have to work or not.
We can go to the toy play, with the cell phone in one poccket in one pockets, and the notebook, typically, on the knee.
And even if they're all sorts of the spring we see our son to break the game, we're also asking the game -- I said, "Do you tell you what this call?"
"Do you answer this email? I have to abboze this liter?
And even when the answer is "no," this makes the experience of your game, very different than what it would be in other conditions.
So, anywhere we look at any part we look at stuff and big, things and all sorts of life, life is a question of choices.
Over the world was this: Over, there were some possibility, but it wasn't a chance.
The world today looks like this: The dilemma is, "Is it a positive thing or negatives?"
The answer is Space.
The positive lights we all know -- so I'm going to talk about negative of the negative side.
All this choice behaviors on two negative effects of the people.
The first paradoxically, is that produces the fresh freation.
With many options between the falls and it becomes very difficult to do it.
I give you an example of meaningful example -- a conducted study on flics.
A connect my connection to the data, the giant data, the giant data, gigantesthize society with about a million clients that have been in 2,000 different companies.
What she found is that for every 10 solutions that are offered in the higher percentage of adegree scene goes down to the four.
And we have 50 sources of offers, there's 10 percent in less than the degree when they are available only 5. Why?
Because with 50 sources of founding, is very difficult to decider, and choice is to be given to the question.
And I ask questions, and I still ask questions, and of course, questions, and of course, I wouldn't get it.
You know that not only means that these workers are going to be eating for dogs because they won't have enough money, it also wants to say that decision is so obsticle source of the workers of the workers of the workers of the dator of the workers of the data.
They don't participation, they're losing until 5,000 dollars for the year from the workers of the workers of the workers of the workers of it.
So the paralysis is a consequence of having too much choices.
And I think that makes the world like this.
"And to ending for ethnic -- mine or maine?"
You just want to make the right decision, if it's for ethernity, right?
You don't want to choose the wrong and you don't want to choose the wrong condition.
So this is the first effect. The second one is that even though we can avoid paralyside, we are less relief and make a choice, we are less relief with less options between the way we choose to the options of which chooses.
And this for different reasons.
One of these is that with a lot of conditions that choices, you buy one and it's not perfect, it's easy to imagine you could have to think you could have to make a better choice that would be better than it would be better than the alternative imagined us to be better choice, the reduces of choice, the reduce the remulti-reduced reliation of the choose of the decision of the decision of the choice,
even when it was a good decision.
More choices are easier I disappeared to any detail that is insoddisfaced by options.
And the economists call is the economists call cost-opportunity.
Dan Gilbert has closely very well stamattine as the value we give things to the value things that we compare to the things that we compare about what we company.
Del remain, when there are so many options possible possible to represent the alternative attiture to the alternative and be less religious option of the option that you have choice.
Here's an example example. I took me with all the people who are not New York.
But that's what you probably think about it.
There's this copy to the Hamptons.
A place of the slow-laxed place.
Spipels in the spind. It's all for them.
No lack nothing.
"All my neighbors in Manhattan are alive.
"I could parking your front of home."
And he walks two weeks with the idea that it's losing -- every day -- the possibility of parking where you want.
The expensive opportunity decreens the relief for what we have, even when choice was excellent to it.
And the most people are the options that we have to consider it, the most characteristic characteristic opportunity.
Here's another example.
This is a lot of things.
It talks about the living moment, and maybe of the living moment, and maybe live slow.
But the most important point is that whatever you choice, you can choose to not do the others.
The things that we don't choose have a lot of attractive attractives that we do it.
Third point: the spiral growing of expectations.
I tried it on my skin buying a new jeans.
I have almost always jeans.
Once the jeans were just a type, bought them and bought them and best, were best, just after having them a life and washed a lot of times, starting to go good.
So I went to buy a couple of jeans, and I said, "I'm going to have a couple of jeans, this is my tape cut."
The committed said, "You want to slim fit, relax, fall?"
You want to do the cernier or with the bottonies?
"Do you want the stretch of rop?"
"You want to be the blood or stret? Ble blah -- you know, left.
I was stair, and after a little bit of I could say, "I want the guy -- which was the only one guy -- which was the only one guy -- so I tried to get all maleans, and I would try and all the maleans, and then came out of the negotia, with the best couple of jeans that I had ever had.
It was the massive. With all that I had the best I had got the better.
But I felt worse.
Why? I wrote a book to understand it.
The reason I was worse is that I was worse with all that choice were stics, jeans had to be perfect.
I had expected minimum minimes. I didn't expect about exceptions, and I was just a guy -- but when you live 100 different things, at least one guy had to be perfect.
What I had the watch was good, but not perfect.
After I talked to the chosen with what I tried I was insodden in front of the expectations.
The adding of options in the life of people do not increase the expectations that these have respects to the options of the options itself.
And this will be less soddisfation, even when the results are good at it.
None in the world of marketing if it makes it content.
Because if you know what I'm talking about.
The truth looks more like this.
"You were better when he was worse. The reason why he was better when it was worse, it was worse, you could get the worst of them as much as you could get some surprised me."
Over the world we live -- opulent industrialized citizens with the expectancy of perspective, the most we can hope is that things are at the expectation of expectation --
You'll never surprised to evolve because your expectations, my expectations, and I got ingiant it.
The secret of happiness -- what you're here -- "Based" "Yes, you want to me."
I mean, small moment -- little authorienty -- which are really married and my wife is really stumy.
I couldn't have better better than I didn't have to do better.
But account is not always a bad thing.
And finally, a consequence of the jeans a couple of jeans when you have that jeans is that when you're not satisfacts, and you ask you "Why?"
"Who is responsible?" The answer is clear.
The world is responsible. What could I do about me?
When there are hundreds of jeans, and you buy a insoddisfact, and you ask you about it is responsible for you, is responsible to it, it's very clearly clear that you are you.
You could have better better than the way
With hundreds of variety available and there are no excuse for the insuccess.
So when people get decisions, even if the result is valid, they feel insodden and they make the hit and damage their hitself.
In the last depression is exploded in the industrialized world.
I think a meaning -- I don't think a unique, but important -- this depression of this depression is just that people have deludged because the standard is too high.
And when they have to explain this situation they think the hit themselves.
So the final result is that we're in general, objectively, but we feel worse.
Let me tell you about it.
This is the official dogmain -- what we all take for good and it's not true.
There's no doubt that a little choice is better than that you don't have any time but it doesn't have any choice that a lot of choice is better than a little choice is better than a little bit.
There's a critical value of critical. I don't know what it is.
But I'm sure we have overcome from a piece of the level where the can make our life.
Now, from the political point -- I have almost finished -- from policiicy point of view -- the nice is the follow.
What it allows all this choice in industrial society is the material wealth matter.
There are many places in the world, and you know about the world, and you know about it, where the problem is not that much choice.
The problem is that they have too few of it.
So the factory of which I'm talking about is a malarial to be exclusive.
And what it does depress and angry is this: Steve Levitt talked about how those costs and swises are useless for bimbes are useless. It's a waste of money.
I mean, these choices, complicated and dispended on it, it's not that they are just useless.
I'm even deleterious in the deleteries.
They make us worse.
If a little bit of what in our societies societies would have a lot of choice was reverse in those where people have too much possibility, it would not only get their life to improve and better.
This is what economists call a paretyan improvement improvement.
A redistribution of the income is good at all -- not only the poor -- because of this choice in the excess that it comes down.
And to conclude, "Fino, you can become everything you want to --
Voo, people in culture, they think about the fish?"
"It's obvious you can't make anything in a mouse of wall."
"A imagination fallen vision of the world's world."
and I got it like this, at the beginning.
But then, I think about it, I realized that the fish the long fish.
Because the reality of the fact is that if you sent the mouse the mouse of the way that "everything is possible," you can't get the freedom.
If you can break the meleless so you can decrecrease diminual decreation.
You get the paralyside, and you get the benefit to well-being.
Everybody need a sphere.
This is almost certainly too stretch stretch -- maybe weight for us.
But the absence of some symbolic symbolic symbolic symbolic -- for the infelicity --
Thank you very much.
