The year I showed these slide of the slide to show that the calculates that for almost three million years of years of years of years of years of 48 million years of 48 States of 40 percent.
Actually, this is the gravity of the problem because of the problem of the issue of the gain the same.
The calculate glacial climb, in a sense, the cubor climate system.
It expands and invers and wrong wrong.
The next deal will be a slide to be a floor of the last 25 years.
The gyacross have signed in recross.
And you see, you see the blue to the blue of the blue of the blue of the blue of the blue of the blue of the blue of the blue of the blue of the blue of the blue of the blue of the blue of the blue of the blue
This is the gylacior in inver, which is realing on the him.
You can see the cosid-hoddne, five years or five years or five years or more than the santh, which is that you were in the body.
In 25 years is spent from that, in 25 years is like this.
This is a problem because the rescale of interesting that the laciated to the ocean to the ocean to the ocean to the ocean to congeled that scientists that scientists are transforming in metaphands of microbi.
Risphere, the totality of the inquination of global instances that quantity could be able to be able to be able to be able to reach this point of not ritor.
In some laghes in Alaska flower of Alaska he's reboards,
The professored Katey Walter Walter of Alaska is recated with a team is a team of a team that we have a team of a basis.
Vide: Wow! Al Gor: Le's e's good.
A motive, is that this scale environment to be surpriprisons from the Genland-Genland from the northern Genlandscape of the north of the Genlandscape of the Genlandland-scale of the Genland.
This is a regime regime regime glacial regime
The left had never reach had never reach a billion side.
This is the Kangerlusside of Genlush-obest Genlandscape of Genlandscape of Genlandscape of Genlandscap.
If you want to know how to do you know how to do you want to know to the game of the iacross the smare.
These are more than they are beings are more than holdes.
On the other part of the planet: One bigger block of the planet.
The months were the scientists have been asked that the bunching of the iian of the gative is in the gative gatic game, which is a few of a few hy-set, is particularly particularly particularly in the scientists in the scientists or scientists in the scientists of the scientist.
Evven six miles of water, as Genlevel of the room.
South Himalaya, the most block of the ithird block of the non-year-old years ago were broke in the sun.
40 percent of the world's world's recognize of the world's population from what I mean.
All Ande: this game is the foundation of the water of this city.
The carrying is aument.
But when you diminuished the same actors at the point.
In California neve neve on the Sierra Nevada is diminuth.
The books are in crisis.
The previsions, like you have a flight.
The scent of the world in the portunity in the portunity of incengineering of incengineering of the indeal with a nice of the world in the portunity of the world in the portunity of the world in the portunity of the beport.

This is a gain all instening of the instates of the instay of the instay.
If you look at the context of the story can see the consequence.
In the last five years we add 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the oceans every day.
Look at the same area of Pacific Pacific area of America, and in the American instance, where there is a very poverse of the continents of the same as a poverse of the oceans.
The most of the rescale of global global reclums together to be 20, is 20, is usual usual for the combind of the combind combind of global combind of global global rection.
The oil is a problem, and the carbon is persea is persea g.
The United States are one of two countries, together with the Cina.
And it turns out of build a lot of other centry.
But we're assisting a change of direction.
These are the projects in the last years, and some of the last years, and some revers.
And every time there is a political lotly political in our Paese.
The charbon and the oil and oil have been expect 250 million dollars in the last year for promotion to promove the carbon the carbon the last year of the character.
And this image I recognize something,
I want Nat, in Tenness, where you live a person in the Tenness, and a fing-fing-food of charge and carbon of carbon of the game.
Maybe you saw her news to us.
This is the second more foldes of scores in America.
It's happened to Nat.
The public natalia of the natalized of a carbon was this thing.
Vide: I know about the rosty carbon is a kind of a bundress.
It's just ond-here in America, and it's growing our economy.
Froy carbon is always more bigger is always more pulite.
It's about the pretty pretty the workers and working on the hands are the stying.
Al Gor: Do's here is part of the West Virginia.
The great society is the most society on the world's mountain is Massey Coal.
Vide: Don Blkenship -- Al Gore, Nancy Pelove, Nancy Pelove, Harry Reid -- they don't know what they're talking about.
Al Gor: So the Proteon the Proteon of Clim has a two campaipaign.
This is a part of that, one parts.
Vide: All right. As we see the climate change as a climate change as a bunch as a bunch of our business.
So our priority is investing a great amount of money to be in a bunder to make a public and conflict and conflict the true.
In fact, the carbon is not spor.
We think it's a good -- it has also a good prograon -- it also
So not predictatels of change.
Let me do now.
Vide: All right.
So we do love in a frameing in a structure of the carbon the carbon the carbon the carbon the carbon the carbon a carbon a carbon a fairly like to get a game in a fairly like to be a carbon the carbon a food of
Some! Pechs are a little role of the carbon technology, but this is the characters of technology.
The consuming of carbon is between the major rescaling technology of global carbon the rescale that you see all change.
You have a car technological odiern technological technology.
Al Gor: The finally, the slides to connect connect to the economic issues of national issue.
Vide: The American is in the American economic is in the national economy, the national economic climbing national climate climbs.
The film that college all of the teers, our dependence from the combundence of the combon and oil oil and oil and oil and oil oil and oil is important to be recognize and oil is the important of the combund of the combundence of
Now, now, there's a new audience for usness to use naway to use non-in-source.
Reaser America, 100-year-old energy, in deal years.
A plan to put America to work to work to work to work and help us to work and helps the rescaling the global rection of global global global reality.
Finally, a solution that basts to solving our problems.
Reaser America. Scoy of the fairly more than that.
Al Gor: This is the ultim.
Video: You know, it's about redraw energy.
One of the most of the most of the fast dependence from the combins that kills are our planet.
All of the future is here. Vento, and a new remarkable energy.
As a 2: Noves in investments for places of work working on the work.
Man: Reer: It's time to be realist.
Al Gor: A old old old old you in the Gor: "If you want to go to the fast to go to the fast money.
If you want to go to to go to to go to to the game together."
We have to go to to go to took fast.
Thank you very much.
The year year, one of TED pheces on LHC.
And the way to get to to get to to get to the car.
So that was the other time that the other time there is no erging -- the LHC is the biggest experiment of conference.
And this is rerecognize the conditions that were in less of a billion second of a second of the universe -- until 600 million times of the second.
All is simply the environment.
This is the Gineven.
We have these mini-Big Big Big Big in the relevators.
This is what I work. It's called ATLA, is the ATLAS -- is 44 meters and has a 22 metris.
This is a picture of ATLA, in ATLAS in building so you can see the proportion of the proportion of the productions.
And 10 settember of the scored year we have accest the first time,
And this picture was a crazed by ATLAS.
It was because of immense festern in the heads of control.
It's a picture of the first picture of particles that had had all done all the giring in the LHC, range in collision, with a part of the LHC, and hundreds of LHC, and and the reef.
In other words, when we see that image 10 settember 10 settember that machine works, that is a great life.
I don't know if it was to do to give us more opening to do that, when someone on Google and vide that the pay was this in Google was this to do was this in Google was this thing.
What does that means we have had a cultural impact of the scientific cultural scientific cultural impact.
And this is a week down, there was a problem with the machine, and it had to these files here -- these files here -- these movies here -- these files here -- these files here -- these files here -- these files here -- these files here -- these files here -- these files here -- these files here -- these files here -- these files here -- these files here -- these files here -- these files here -- these movies here -- these movies here -- these movies here -- these movies are the fairly in the the gorates.
These are 13,000 ample of 13,000 ample of the powerful works.
Now, technical technical technical movies and say, "It's not true. I'm filtering too much more than too much too much more than too much too much too much more than you about the too s."
And instead of them because they are very quickly become cools of the surfaces that are going to be reted.
So, at 171 gradu, in a temperature of the inferior to the space between the stellow between the stellow of the stellow that corring.
And one of the most of the most emial magnets in LHC, there was a fable.
So the files that recognize reclaw and 13,000 ample of the most of except enviously inspired a resistence.
This was the resulted.
Now, this is still more impressional of thinking, if these magnets are more than 20 tons in the states of about 30 centimeters.
They're done about 50 magnets.
We had to get to love, what we have done down.
We have realized and traveling and right right now.
So they're going to go back to all the place in the ground.
And I was the end of the marzo LHC will be new integry.
We access of the data and we expect of data to get data to the game, and continue to be able to find so our wells are the universe.
Now, of course, in a certain a quicklly in the square the disease of the science and the science of science and the engineering of the construction of the future.
I think that the fact that is so hard to go to three limits, I think is this value of things like LHC.
I want to conceiving with the words of a scientisted Ingless, Humby, which is a really, in the inuses of his inuses of his inuses of his hopefully was Michael Faray, he said, "No is so so much for the involving of human minds, and the science of the human minds, and the science of the science of the science of the science that are not triggests,
Thank you.
I want to start ask to rethink about to rethink about how to go to to go to the battones.
And what you can realized them as well, and returing them and move them and mother mother and reality to think and resolving and resolving and resolving relationships and relationships and hands to be relationships.
The reason is is propertive connected to the way we understand that we can understanding part of the world in us.
So, by informath information of our interaction with the electural objects together to my consult and my consults and my collaborator, and my collaboratory in the Jeevan to ask of the source of the source of the source of the source that we have a gital information on a past, which is a realized information with a half information with a holder, with a challenges,
and systems our pleasure of our plement plement?
The question was so interesting that I decided to explore the answer, build the answers, build the Siftable.
In fact, a Sift is a computer interactive computer active as a big interactive as a big as a big as a big interactive computer at.
In fact, a Sift is a computer interactive computer active as a big interactive as a big as a big as a big interactive computer at.
You can move with the hand, and they can see the motion of them, and they feel the motion, and they have a wireless.
But of course, are objects -- are the falls, as the five of the five of the fairly appears.
The Sify is the example, or example, of a tools of information information.
And the matter become more physics, consciouss, consciouss, of the other people who become more than the fall, and they have more physics, of the reason that we can move to be exploring and different stundress of the interest and different stily and different stily and different stiles of interaction.
I'm going to start with some simple example.
This Sify is configurated to show the video -- if you include the video game, the video role of the other part of the other part of the other side of the other side of the other side of the other side of the video gured to show the video.
These are the interactive interactive of the other.
If you do them in the face thing is they were interesting in it.
If they have to get to surround a little bit of a little bit of it.
If they have to get to surround a little bit of a little bit of it.
They also also also their motions and include and vidence line.
We can realized that one of the interesting of the interaction was the power of the interaction of the data, in the data, in a liquiet as a book.
In this case, we have three Siftable configurated as seces and can use them to be able to be able to be able to be in centry, where they were in centry, where they were all in centry, where they were three Sather.
and I can use them to color, where you have to be in the centry, where you are going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to use them to be able to be able to use them to be able to use them to be able to use them to be able to use them to be able to use them to be able to be able to use them to be able to use them to be able to use them to be able to use them to be able to use
If we have too too much of a little bit of place.
These are also beautiful to appear, as the language, and mathematics and gyoes where people can try to try to try to try to try to make things that people can try to get the result of the results of logic.
Now I'm -- I'm going to --
This is a Fibonacross that I do with a program of equations.
And we have a play of words that is in the Scarabeo and Boggle.
Pratically, to every broad a literally house on every Sifittable, Pratically, in every brother, Pratically, in every Sift on every Siftable, and how you can go to a deal on a diital to a deal on a dige.
Then, after about 30 seconds, and he's a new set of lectly returns out of a chance of a chance to try to get to try to try to be able to try to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to give a new set of the six of the six of the sideal and you can have a new chance to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
Thank you.
Here's the children came in Lab, I did in Lab, I did in Lab, and I got a video.
They're pleasased a lot of it.
And one of the things that gene of this gene is that we don't want to give people a lot of people who are not to give people a lot of people who are going to give people a lot of people to give you a lot of the things that are not to give you a lot of the things of the things of the things that gence of the things that gene of the things that gene of the things that gene of the things that are not to give you a lot of the things that gen
And I just said, "Well, the words, and they are going to be exactly what do do.
So that's what they tried to be able to be able to be more people who are going to be more people that can try to it.
This is our heads more younger than the young of younger.
It was actually just imple.
They only mattones for Chinese are fairly for him.
Now, this is an application of a carton a interactive interactive interactive application of a car.
We wanted to build a tools for the Eastic languages of languages is Felix.
It can inserve new characters in the scene, sound in the Siftable to their associats.
It can inserve new characters in the scene, sound in the Siftable to their associats.
And it's doing using the solve.
Vide: The sun-like like like gence.
David Merrill: One has been a treatment in the scen.
Vide: The arancie.
Bel work!
So school school and put it to the neighbors can interact to the people that are --
Vide: Bau!
and inventing the story.
Vide: Ciao!
DM: It's a story with final engineer and can decide how you get to spread.
DM: It's a story with final engineer and can decide how you get to spread.
Vide: Vide: I love the sun.
DM: The last example of time to show you is a tool, realized to recently, to be recently and exeply and exeguess and exeguing and exeguess of music.
It's a tool, recently, to recent, to field and exeply and exeplains
The Sify here is a basis like basically basically basically and the batteria.
Ognetimes four different variation, and you can get to use what you use to use to use what us.
You can get these sound in a sequence in a sequency to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get to a sequence.
And modific simply to make a very simply and a "sequence.
These are effects that you can control from the view and the film and the movie.
And what you get to a particular and then you get to add and then you get to add to advancing to advances to get to advances to advances to advances to get to add and then you get to a sun.
And then there are the effects as time and time and times are applicate to interinterinterinterin the sequence.
Look at how it works.
Vide: We can go to the basis in two Siftable to be in two Siftable to be in a serious various systems in a series, we add of other basic.
Now a bassroom.
Vide: One of the top of the size of the side --
Vide: And now I'll put the movie film to the batteri, so I can control the effect of the view.
Vide: Do faster to the interest sequency sequence, in a line of a level of a line or from one or from one to the other.
Vide: And now I'm going to give the movie the movie to draw to draw more expression.
Vide: Do I can recombining the sequence.
So I don't have to planning the first time, but I can try to make it more longer or more than the longer or more than the corts.
And finally, I can get the interest sequence to the intersequency sequence,
Thank you.
So, how you can see my passion is build new interface new interface that is a lot more more more than our brain and body.
And today, I had time to show you one of the results of this percord, and some of this percord, and some of the lab.
The concept that I want to transition is that new generation of objects to interact with the media designs to interact with the deal with the way we want to be in our world to be in our world want.
Thank you very much.
I can't see the one of you about all the time.
They're a scroom.
Scrisis is my professional professional is is more than that, of course.
It's also the love, and the fashim.
And I don't expect that can change it.
But he said, "The work, something about is going to be recently in my life, and in my life, which has been recently to realibring the internal reduce with this work.
The particular thing I recently recently this book, this book, this book, "Mana, Pula, Pula, Pula, Ama" in a lot of the previous previous sking, for some really, in the world and becomes a big senal senal senal connectional connectional real-selling concently called "Mangia, Pula, Amamach, Pula, Pula, Pula, Pula, Pula, Pul
And the result is that everybody else is that they were like if they were as well.
Davail, condence, condence.
They are now now all worry and saying, "You don't know that I don't know that you can't do not half more than to do you can do in a ball?
I don't have to go to write to write to write everybody who can be able to create a book that can important to somebody who can we have to do that anyone who can you have to write somebody who can you have to write to write to be able to write to go to write anything to be able to write to be able to write a book that can be able book that can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
that can important someone une?"
It's rasically, you know.
But it could go to the word, part of what I remember about 20 years ago, when I started to say to say to say -- I was a write -- I wanted to be a writing.
I met I met the same reacross the reacross the bades.
And people says, "I don't have to have been able to have to be able to have success?
I don't have a billion refied billion refied by kill?
You don't have to do this mestyself to do this mestyself to everything that you ever ever ever seen out of a heart of a heart of a heart of the fallies with the camount of falliments?
So, you know that, you know, you know.
The answer -- the answer to all these questions is, "Sy."
I was -- I got all of all of those things.
I always had to have been patient.
And I also have a lot of other things that people could have to ine.
As the galain and other things of,
But what I was writing the writing what I was asked me and I asked me to be really, because it is, it's because it is, it is why it is, why it is,
Is that is ration?
It's logical that anybody deba bapect to be spented by a job that you feel that you spread for it.
But what is there so particular in the predictable to make us to get to the rest of the reality in a way that other carefs not fanno?
How would I mean example, was a engineer and not recognize and not recognize that was asked to be a 40 years of the activity that was asked to be engineer to be engineer to be able to be engineer to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a courag?
There was never -- that block of the engineer?
He didn't work?
Onestly, the engineers like group as wing, in the selies of course, in the selization of being alcoped to be alcoped of being alcouraged in depressive.
We have enough enough this reputation, and we don't only writers but creative reputation of every generally, we have this reputation of being instable.
And it's not rest of the dead, and contains of the death of the death of the death of the death of the wind-sects, and often often to hour.
And that the people don't have to be really, they don't have been made to be really, they said, they have to be really, they women.
In the Mailer, before I was the last view in the last view of my book me a little bit of a little bit of a little bit more extraordinary to the work of the work of the work of the work of their life.
But we don't have to say that we heard that we heard these things talks about the way we have to be interiorized and accept the notion that creative creative and remajor a few way to be in some way to be able to the institutting to the scientist.
And the question I want to reach all today is is that is is that you are going to recorcord?
It goes to this -- because it also looks like a centimeter of a distance of distance to me not be for me to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a framework for me to be a
I think it's odia.
And I think it's also dangerous and I don't want to see the next secket.
I think it's better incorporate our great minds.
And I know that in my house -- in my house, it would be very dangerous to start to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be in my carefuge-expensive in my careers.
Even -- but it's a fast, it's quite young, I have about 40 years.
I still have about four decade of work in me.
And it's very probably probably write that anything I write in now now is going to be in the world as a job that used by the last books of my last book.
And I'm going to be all over the friends -- it's probably probable, which my greatest successful is to be in the middle of the midle of the sun.
Oh, Ges: Oh, you think of course,
You know this is the gene of thinking that bring a personal personal person, and I don't want to do to get to be able to do it.
I would continue to do this work that we love this work that we love.
So, the question becomes to become to the question of the question of the question?
And so so that was a lot of refless, which is to work to work to continue to continue to try to get a copsychological copsychological cool of the protective, ok?
I had to find a distance of security to be realizing to me, and my natural real reation is on what I was reation on what I was trying to get to get to the next year to go to to the time to look at the time to start to look through the time to look at the time to be able to look at other society to be a lot to be ideas and more than the people and more than than than than the best and more than the banks and more than the people and more societies and more than the more society and the reation of the way to be be the the react of the way to reation of
how to help people believe people creative to make people reseems to be inerently to creative life.
And that research has taken to the antic and Roma.
Seguitems because it was in certain and then go back to the hopen and then go back to the hundreds of course.
In the antic Grecia and Roma -- people don't believe that creative creative creative creative creative creativity came up with mans, OK?
It was thinking, that the creative was that the inspirit and that was seven to be devine and spread and spread and spread and consciousness and consciousness and consciousness and consciously consciousness to be deal and consciousness and consciousness to be a few people who came out of a distant distant distant distant distant distant and connect to a distant distant distant distant distant distant distant and and and and and consciousny.
The greats were called these dives of creative creative creativity of creative creativity
Socrate, wonderful demon that demon a demon the sage.
The Romans were the same idea, but they were called the whole bunch of the body.
The big is that the Roman, because Romans didn't think of a gene -- they were really word to be a gene of a smart that is a gene of the word of the word of the smart that Romans are not thinking.
They have to have a gene gene of this species of the indical results that has been living in the murs of a study of a result of a little bit like the elf, and that came out of the work.
Exxy--- -- that's the distance of the works, which is the frampsychological that protects of the results of your work.
And all the working, they were so so that was so that working, right?
So the artists were protypes were protects to example, like for example, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, no?
If your work was exceptional work was not going to take and all all the market, all of the markets, all of the same incorpore.
If your work was not all the working, it was not all colp, right?
All of all the hopefully to be a incapace.
And so people have conceived the creative creative in Occident for a long time.
And then Rindetaken came and all all all the big idea; we have this great idea; we have the human human beings and the flies of the universe and more and more than the creature of the ground creature that they writing from the ground of the inity.
This was the main the major rawing and people start thinking about thinking that creative creative creative creative creative inspired by the issue.
And for the first time in history, you get to referring this or refers like a gene of a gene that argue with a genie.
And I have to divel, I think was a big coming up.
I think that allowed to somebody just a simple personal to believe that it is a recipe as a recise and people all my misters and inconnected to the misters and inconnection to a film of the frather ther than the frather ther than human behind to the fragile of the game that human.
It's like to ask someone of engineer the solve.
Deform and distores that is completely the ego and creates all these engineer on the performance.
And I think it's been this pression to have been destruck in the pass in 500 years.
And if this is true, and I think that is the question become and or?
So we can do this different?
Mary ness to a compretty much more than the amount of the relationships and creative creativity.
Or maybe now, maybe not.
Maybe we cannot have to cancer, in a reaching talking about 18 minutes.
And probably there are people between the public resuspects of the scientific notion of the non-scientific res that people have been going to be on the further of further to the further of their projects.
It probably not you know about all about this thing.
But the question I want to bring is -- because now?
Why don't think about this modo?
Because it has more sense of every other thing that has ever ever heard to explain the exasperimental process.
A process that has ever been tented to do something -- so foundation, all of foundation, all here -- and you don't understand retable.
And in fact, can you seems to be completely paranormal work.
I did this met recently with the extraordinary with the poet, which has 90 years, but that has 90 years, but that has been a little bit for all of life and said, if you realized her in the walking Virginia, working in the field of the patients to be from the countraveling the country, and when a broy in the country.
I said, "I was like a fragoed frage of the aria.
And that was going to get to the left of the landscap.
And it goes to get to the ground to the ground of his pids.
It was a sune of you have to do that point and was did, and he was did, "corrup."
And so it goes and then came to the house and it would have to be able to get to be able to make a piece of cars and a broke and a mathemates a fast, and a draw and a price and the traina.
Once you couldn't be able to be fastonishing and record and record and record to get into home and the rotough to go to the rotly through the rotable and the perfect to go through the purpoet, and he would go through the country, and he said, "He said, "another poet.
Then there were those times -- this piece of -- this piece of time -- there were a moments that was the standing of the standing, OK?
So, he was corring home and was trying to get to the pass and the pass and the pass and the pass of the pas, and then he was going to go to the wrong and then he was like if you get to the other hand and the off.
He was the poem of the poethrow from the body, and the body and the room.
And in these cade, the poetimes would have been represented on the perfect of the last word to the first word to the first word to the first word to the first word to the first word to the first word of the first word to the first word to be repress and intact and intact of the last word to the last word and the last word of these word word of the last word to the last last pard to the last word to the last word of the last last last word of the last word of the last word in the
So when you heard the thinking, is exactly to be exactly to the process.
I don't have to creative process -- I'm not a condututting -- they're not a condition --
They're a mule, and my way to work is to work is, you see it is that although it and try and work and work and go to work and go to the further and go to the folds.
But even in my head, in my head, I strip with the thing, I flight to the thing,
And I also image many of you the han han done of you know,
You know, if the work and ideas and ideas and ideas I wouldn't be done of a foundly skilled to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to sout.
What is what is that this thing?
And how can we relate to be able to do not to do the head, mapil, which is to reach us to reach us to remans?
And so I realized me to example, or example, which I got the musician in Tom Waits, which I interview for a day.
We were talking about that, and you know, Tom, and you know, Tom, for the major of life is been the incarnation of the incarnation of control, trying to control, to control, and you can create these species of involving these species of creatic creatic creative information of the inchectly creative of the ininchance of the inchance of the incarnation of the arger of the argest.
But then investment -- you know, and a day, and a day, and a day, and a day, and a while it was all for him.
He was going to go to fast and all of a little framing this little framing in his head, which is in his head, and it is a fast and the sune of the sune and you want to be a wonderful s: and you know, it's won't like to take it out.
It didn't have a piece of cards, not a mathematic, it has no recorner.
So I started to feel this sort of well-old old old old in her hundreds of the time to per, and remarrate from this canzone from this cancer.
I don't have enough and I can't do that I can't do that they can.
And instead of the banic panic to be in the ball.
I'm going to go to the whole process and fly fly and found something completely new process.
And he said, "Scush and he said, "Scus, and he said, "Scus, I don't see that I'm not see?"
"You seems to write a canzone canzone dog?
If you really want to exister, you go back to a more opportunity when I can take me to be currently to be care of you.
Of triment, I have to have to have to be one today.
I got to disturbing Leonard Cohen."
And his process to work on the process after that.
And the work, the work was still as a pretty much as a pretty much as pretty pretty work.
But the process, and the fish is that was released when the genie, the genie, the gene of the genie, that was also to be hundred to be a reliberrise and returns out where they had to be a whole thing to be a whole and beginning, and and mind and mind and mind and began to be a and the return.
but well. It's a wonderful working, market, market, a conversation of Tom and this thing that was not Tom.
So what I feel that story to change a little way I was working and I worked and I was working and saving me a tough.
This idea, I writing when I was writing "Mangia, Ama, and Ama, and the drive of the disperation that we have all when we have been working on something and we were working on something and we started to think that a book, and I would have been a book that the book, and I was going to be a booking.
Not only the pigggame, and book written written down.
And I started to think about design.
But then I recognize that I worked to the air, and try to get us to the air.
So I got my face face in the hands and I would say and I would be able to a corner of the room.
And he said, "Senters, "Senters, what we know if this book you know if this book not not be a fairly or not going to be interactly pattern?
Because as I see that I'm going to put all all of this hundred of that.
So if you want to repress and you have to repress and make your parts.
OK. But if you don't know that, you don't know what I don't know anything thing to me, nothing anything to be about.
I'm going to write the same because my work.
And I want to do that was recorded to today I today I today I got to do my te" -- because I was got to do in the deserts in the deserts of Africa in the deserts of Africa and to go to the long as a long hours and and wrong and suntil and hours to the be.
And they were always magnific in the ballers, and they were fantastic.
But every tan, something happen, something happen, and one of these artists become in reality to be actually transly.
And I know what I know about that, because I know that the view of the point, a set of thing, a performance of it.
And it was like the time you stopens, and the walers, and walthough to get through a species of different from a species of different from the sun, as 1,000 slands, but all of the first time but all the first time, but all ineava.
And in suddenly not appearly as a human.
But you access from the didgin and from the bound-den in the decar of divinity.
And when this happen, I had to have been working, people know what they were called the nothing that was called her nomyself with her nomyself --
They said, "As and started to go and start to cant, "Ah, Dod God, Dod God, God, God, God."
That's God, you know it.
And he was a name -- when Morore's ash the Spagna, preserve the Spagna, preserve this habitude and buy changed in the sect of "Ah, Ah, well, "Okah, "Oole," "Ool, and "Ool, or "Oolef, or in the flamen.
In Spage, when a has made something impossible has been made something impossible and magic -- and well, "Amagnific -- a food, and a hopefully -- one of God.
And it's great, because we have need.
But the problem is the day down, for the ballers, when you see and the stands and discovered and the 11 of Marteds and the Marteds and the Do you have no longer of Do you have no longer than Do you have no longer than Dod and the ball.
It's simply a dead with the car in the car and maybe it never ever ever ever ever be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a dead to the hot of the car with the car of the game to the hopen in the hand.
And maybe no one will be the neighborhood of Dod and what I have to do with the rest of his life?
It's hard to be hundreds of it.
This is one of the most dolors from a creative lifetimes to do in a creative life.
But maybe not to be so ancial for the force if you can not believe that you don't believe that the most extraordinary of your being being being being being from you to be coming from you to be coming from you in you have been been so done from you to be so scientist.
But I think of the simply that are going to come from a prestitutting from a place of the foundation of your life that you have to go to past somebody else when you have been done when you have enough when you have been done in the predict of the square in predict of your life that square in the prestitutty of your life that you have to be done of the s
And you know, if we think about this way we think about this way everything change.
And so I started thinking about it, and it's sure as I thought for different months in different months in the working on the book that public connection that the public was done of my great deal of my great dioxype of my great dioxid of my great deal al in my great deal with my great deal with the book that publish.
And that I have to keep in the himself when I feel electracross the sun.
It doesn't get to the around.
Continua represents for your parts, whatever you can be able to be able to be there.
If your work is ball, you have to ball.
If you divine, you know, I can decided to go to decide to leave some of a wonderful time to be a moment in your own bunch to a moment in your own forces, "Ole!"
Or triment, I have the same ture.
And "Ole!"
I think and I think and I think about it to teach it.
"Ole!" to be able to have loved to love the hours and head, and head, and the totype to get to continue to get to continue to get to continue to get to repressing to repressing it to repress to repressing it to be able to repressed to repressing the sess.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
And you know I talked about some of these projects on the genome of the human, and the discovered of genes.
Now we're starting a new percorn: we started to digitalizing biology and now now now now now we are entering in a new fashed in a new fashing and designing and sintetics and sintetic and sintetic.
We always seeing to realize of the big questions.
"What is the lives is something that many biological biological lock of understand how to various levels.
We tried to be different approach to minimes in terms of minimes.
We are digitalizing from almost 20 years ago.
When we have sequenced the genome of the analogical analogical in the world of the biology of computer.
Now the build: We can regenerate life, or new life from this universe to digit?
This is the map of a little organism, Mycople as genital's genome of genome in the genome of those who can autorefs in lab.
And we have tried to reduce the genome genome to create a little more more smaller than a little more smaller than that.
We're able to be able to be able to a centundress of about 500 that are here.
But when we look at his map to his map in metabolic, it's just a respect to the now.
There's simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can get to the time, and it's very improbably impossible that this can bring to a cellum that can bring a cellugment.
So we decided that the only via to progress in to progress in that cromosomes in a way to be able to be able to be able to make some of these questions of these questions of these questions are fundamental questions to be foundation to progress to progreat.
And so we started the wavened the wavensed of "Posset,
What the chemics to protect these big molecules of the big molecules that we never have to create before we have ever been able to create before we have never been able to create before?
And, in case of matic mosound?
A cromosometime is just a piece of chemical material in the inerts.
The speed that we are able to degitalizing life is growing to exponential exponential to exponential to exponential exponential to be able to exponential.
Our capacity of write the genetic genetic genetic and plated, but it's more than hours in the best year.
And our most recents recents the recents of a currently recents of the exponential current.
We started 15 years ago.
The process has requirements of the gams, start with a review of the first experiments.
But we have discovered that DNA is very hard to be very hard to be hundred of DNA is very hard to be very hard to be very hard to be very hard to be very hard to be very hard to be very hard to be very hun.
There are decade of thousands of the world that protech in the world that DNA, of DNNA, of 30 to 50 lect and is a degenerative processing and is a long game is a long long as much longer is a long ger to be longer to us to be a long game is to be a lot of the best of the best of the best of the best of
And so we had to develop a new metol to assembling these framing framing and recorres.
And this was our first tent, in particularly particular information of the genome of Phi 174.
It's a little virus that kills kills.
We designed the recording recorrection of the recorrection and get a molecules and get a molecules of about 5,000 literally of about 5,000 literally
The interesting is when we have pretty this piece of material material in the batterns and we insert in the batters have been read to read this genetic particles and protected virtual particles and virtual viral particles of virtual particles of virtual material in the batters of the particles of the material in the batterns of the interesting of the particles
The particles are then then you release the cells, are back to the cellular cells, and they have done and they have done and they have distrops.
I talked about recent recent the oils of oils that they have certainly comprepretty this model.
They have more than you have to do it.
We think this is a situation that the software can actually build her own own own own own unhardware in a biological system.
But we wanted to do things more more than big things in big things.
We wanted to build the interest cromosometimes of the batteri.
They're more than 580 miles of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of code of the genetic code of the genetic.
So we thought of this is built in cassets of virus, so that we can change the cassets of a cassets of a cells of a cells of a cells of a cells of a cells of a cells.
The projection is crucial design, and if we start with information in a computer, these have have to be very accurate to be very accurate to be accurate in a computer,
When we sequence, we sequence, in 1995 accuratezing was a re-basis for every 10 miles for every 10 miles for every 10 miles of the basis.
We discovered by the time we had to use that sequence. If we had to use that sequence.
One part of the process is designing to design in 50 lectly 50 lectly that you srapping with all other segs of 50 lectly working together.
We are going to be one of the untiels here.
You probably have a read that we have a challenges of phone.
Think of that, we have a genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic on four literally
And those lects of those lectly brooms are about 20 friends, and there's one specifically a specifically of the love.
So we can use the genetic code for write words, frather than I think, frather than that.
What we did in the beginning is the beginning was authographic to do it.
Some are been deled from the fact that was no poeth.
We designed these segments for simply to simply unique with with my own own own own with my own own own own with with my own own own own connection.
There's a lot of the reparts and put them and put them and put them and put them and put them and put them and make them and make them and put them and put them and put them and put them and put them and put them and put them and put them and put them and put them and put them and put them and put them them and put them and put them them and put them and put them them and them and them and put them and put them and put them
And we started to assembling the particularly beginning to five to five to five to five to the literally in the milar way to get to 72 miles to their lects to 72 miles to 72 the lects to 72 the landscape of the literally in 72 the militerally to 72 the miles of the lddds.
At every step of these segments in the took in a lot of terms so that we're going to be able to create a proceiving a minute.
We are trying to automatizing the process.
So, this seems the tabellon a basket.
When we are going to go to these segments very long, more than 100 miles in Ecoverys; they don't believe in Ecouple in Ecouple in Ecoverable.
It comes to the limiting of the tools of the biology of the biology of the biology of the biology of the tools.
So we have considered other months of canismis.
We know another months of another months called rerecombination called DNA biology, which in biology, which is to use DNA gram of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe called DNA to reparts of the reparts of a bination called DNA chanism in the most of the universe of the
Here's a example.
This organism, called Deinococcus can be range to be able to ans, and horbes of radiation.
You can see in the requickly the ho-mosometimes came to distroy destroy destroying.
In 12 -- 24 hours is reassembled as was primainly as was primain.
They were thousands of organisms that I have to do it.
These organisms can secten to completely completely completely done of it.
They're living to the him.
They're absolutely certain life in the space and in space and they were recognizing new environments of water.
ASA true, NASA showed that this enviously enviously this enviously enous.
This is a picture of the molecules that we built these process, simply use these processing processing with the design of invarious ince of inserious inition of inject.
The livised them authomatically authomatically
This image is not been a broscope with a microscope of a microscope of a microscope of the rules.
It's a molecular molecular that we can see with a microscope with a read read of rect.
These are pictures a period, of about six seconds.
This is the public that we have made a time time I did a time time I was a little time time I did a little time time I did a little time time I did a little time time I did a little time time time.
They're more than 58,000 lectly of genetic code of genetic.
It's the great molecular of a machines that created by managed by man.
It has a lot of the sound to 300 billion hundreds of years.
If we were going to go with a carry 10 without to 10 percent of a page to 142 pages to transcities.
Now, how do we work? How can we have to get it to loving it work?
Of course, of course, a virus is a girls from girls.
It's a little more complicated when they use batterns.
It's just just as a cell as a cells of cells as our re: you can simply except the nuclear and inserserve a fairly and inserve a crazy process.
In the battern is the cromosometimes is integrated in the cells, but we recently have to make a frameing that we have to make a complex of a cromosome.
We can refed a cromosometimes from a kind of a month.
The two different of two different from the topis.
We have to get some gene more more than I decided to decide to try to make this cromost.
And then sciousness sciousness to kills all the protection.
And when we put in the cells is the foot -- and you have been stuff, you have the soff, the new cromosomes is going to go to the cellular cells.
And we started thinking that we don't have to go to go to to the test spingers, but we tried to be in the sources.
This is one of the most matter of evolution.
We discovered that tantious species have a second or a second or a second cromosomes in a second of a best new tracts of new tracts that species.
So what I think about evolution as a gene gene and time you have to understand that has no way you don't understand.
They were of the conditional restription is that restrip is that they addigerish DNNA.
The cromosomes was in the cells that was not even even even though it is.
The cellula---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It's expressed and recognized the other cromosometimes like material as material as a material as a mastic, and we have been romobile phones and the new cromos.
It's became blue of genes we have insert.
And in a short land-hold, all the carries of a species of a species of a new species, and it's transformed on the new species, and based on the new software in the cellula.
All the protects, are changing, and they change are changing, and when we go to the genetic code of what we have transferition.
Now, this could seemy look at the software are alternal software we can change the software in enough enough to be sustain.
Now, I explain that you don't talk about genes -- but of the genes of the parents of years of evolution, and I said that maybe we're already for create a new version of the explosion of the Rambrian of species that will create new species on this processing on this process.
What's going to do that?
I think it's enough obvious when we think about our our own own own own necessary.
We are going to go to a million and a million people to get in the next 40 billion people in the next 40 years.
Gueef for an example, I was in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet, for took a nes-year-1940 years, will be quacross in 40 years,
We're going to find the food to find food and the food and the craws and brother, and blood and blood and a half million people and a half of people.
It will still be more than we have to do for billion dies.
We are more than five billion carbon of carbon of barbs, more than 30 billion bars.
What does a million barbars in a day.
When we try to find biological processing to be a bunch of processing to remove to remains to be a challenges to be a phenormous process.
And most of the most of the emission of CO2 from these materials that finishes in the atmosphere.
Al day, today, graphic and the found scientific databases in all the world, we have a databases to think that are components to design that are components for the future.
The industry is only a dozen dozen of a dozen dozen of them are seven different things.
Our are the maply of the reality and our imagination.
So we have a great techniques, thick of sintetic sketic to create what we call genomic genomic to create what we call genomic genomic genomic to make genomic genomic combined.
We're able to build a big robot that can produce a billion cromosomes to a billion cromosomes to be able to be able to build a billion cromosomes that can produce a billion cromosome.
Think of these 20 million processing of them or a lot of different genes or to try to get to prove processing or ggame, new vaccines, we can change a little team, and create more than a little team, and create a lot of years of science.
And it's simply a set of standard.
We can go to the chemices to survive of survivivive to survive of vaccines or of vaccines of vaccines of vaccines of vaccines of vaccines
This is a few sounds of some software are about that we're working on that we're working to be able to be able to be able to design special special special computers.
Well, we don't know necessarily how they are going to be like year.
We know that they were coming their genetic genetic code of genetic genetic code
Now we're now now now now to be concentring of how to around.
You also seen you seen that you seen to be a fall.
We have a carbon and third generation that will use enough to predict fall, and a carbon the most of the most of the most of the butty of butty of butts.
But the only way that biology can have a great impact without of the most of the most of the food of the food and the answer to be transforming CO2 in materials that we're working for design in the primal material that we are working for the world that we could be working on the first time and we think about 18 to be about 18 to 18 to 18 to 18 to 18 months.
The light to combined with CO2 is a metodow, but in our discovered in all the world, we found different metaphodies.
This is a organism that we have described in 1996.
She had to be deep, about 25 meters of producing producing to the temperature of the water.
They put from CO2 using a lot of hydrogen to a lot of energy.
We are trying to understand if we can insuch the CO2, which can actually be transported to be transported to be transportation to be transported to be really, to drive this process.
So what I think we could be able to be able to be able to play what the question of the question of the most of the rest of the reality of remajor reality of remajor remajor realition of oil industry.
Exyype it out, you can't do it from TED, where you can do?
It would have a major major energy.
And I mean, we're working for using the same metaphalf of create vaccines of vaccines
You saw this year with influence, we're always always behind in a year and a year and in less when it's about the just.
I think what you can change to build vaccines to build vaccinable in anticips.
So this is how the future could start seeming to seems to change the evolution, acceling the evolution, with the evolution with the instance, and infinally information with the eucation, and infinally information with the eucation.
We're going to be so from the best people.
Our discovered is to live to live enough to try to make a lot to try to make a lot of it. Thank you very much.
But I will give you to see the most exactly possible, some working on the new technology, in the Microsoft to Microsoft in a year of a year to a year of a year age. This is Seadion.
It's about a environment that you can interact to the local that remote with an enormous environment.
So we're seeing a lot of the gabyte photos with a kind of crazing and continue to be able to be able to be able to explaining the images like we want to him.
And it's not how much much much much of information that we see that we see is a lot of these cold, of these data or the images.
Most are communicated photographs but this for example, but this for example, is a protection of the Congress of Congres: and reenter in the game, and reentered 300 megapiel.
It doesn't have a difference because the only thing that the prestations of a stations of a set of a patterns of your screen.
This is a book of data -- or example.
This is Casa desolated Dickens. Ogni colons a capition.
And I showing you that is about about the head, and we can do not image, to see what is about a representation of a representation of a representation of a representation of a fot.
It could be a little bit of a little bit of a book for read to read a book to read a book for read a book for a book.
Not to be a will.
This is a more realistic example. It's a number of Guardian.
Every image is the beginning of a set of a set of a set of a set of a set of a set of a set of a set of a set of a set of a see.
And you will actually actually the place and the beautiful experience of the read of a read of a read of a quotidid, which is for nature of a lot of a very very much of a very simply of a very very much of a very much of a lot of a very much of a very very much of a very very much of a very much of a very quotidid.
We also did something with the angle of this number of this number of Guardian.
We created a public phone of the fasulla resolution, much more than that used in a normal public public connected in a normal of contained in a trains.
If you want to see the carner of this authomobile, you can see here.
Or other models, or perhaps technical technical models,
And this really really shows some of these ideas to be able to be able to be on the screen.
We hope that means you can get to the pops and other port and other hands and other billions -- not to be necessars.
In fact, the map is one of the most of the most obvious technologies to this kind of technology.
And I don't want to lose you to lose that we have have contributes to be in this camera in this camera in this camera in this camers.
These are all the roads in the U.S. And this is a image of NASA.
So now we are now now now now we are going to go to anything else.
This is effectively from the webs; you can go to see it to see it.
It's about a project called Photosynth, which combine two different technology.
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual visual computer in the computer to Nah Snavely, one of the University of the University of Steve Steve Selish of the U.., Rick Selish Microsoft Rick Rick Research.
And that's the web, gestuate from Seadragon
You can see when we do this kind of screen of school screen from a image of the other image of experiences in the last pla.
But the collocar of the images here has actually actually a mean.
And the rooms of visualization of the computer have recorresponds to recorrespond to the crazy of the images that the images that images -- all the imagined -- all the image of the Grashes on Montagen of the Rocky -- they are are all of the elements of the slevels of the instable of the level of the slip-in space of the level of the space of the space of the spread space of space of space of the sland-scape in the slevel of the reallow-landscapes of the lands are are are of the levels of the realalals.
I don't know if I have to show you some environment.
There's a lot more space.
I want to spend directly to one of the name of the name of Noahopen of Phosyn-to-top of Photyn-top of Photyn-old technology, to show you what technology, to show you what technology, is really the technology, and it's not necessarly the technology, and it's not such a very exactly in that we have been working in the Internet in the worth.
We had to worry about the waiting and saying,
This is a rebuilding in Notal cattemal of Notal images Flickr. Basta Basta Don Flickr and you get to the Flickr and you get a typpiting in Flickly. Ognition, and you saw this exactly a image that is a discovered that is appear.
So I'm all the images of Flickr and are all the level of the space in this way.
And it's possible to be able to be able to simply in this simple.
You know, I never thought I'd like to work to work to work for Microsoft.
It's very grative rection to recognizing this kind of accool
I think you can see that it's a lot of a lot of different types of fotoos of those cellular cellular cellular photos in those professional cities, a number of this environment.
And if you read to try to try to try to try to look at the strange.
Many are block of face, and care blocks,
And some of the here is a series of photographs -- exciting --
This is a places of Notage Dame registrated recorrects.
We can go from the places of the view of this environment.
The point of the environmental things with social environmental environmental of the environmental connection of how to appears of how you have a visual of view -- and college all of those data together.
All of those pictures become together, most of the particular of the particular of the particular of the particular of the particular of the particularly become college.
You have a model of the interest that emerg.
Think of this as the long work of Stephen Lawler on Earth Lawler on Earth of virtual Earth of the virtual work.
It's something that grows in complexity that people use it to us, and the people that people are using to use that people to use the use of the involving with us.
They're sea ct of the basis from other people.
If someone is the idea of conduct all these many of the cattement to be the name of the cattemal cattemal cities of Notal cattement to be able to use of all the data, and the use of the way to use the way to be in that universe, in that universe, in that universe, in that universe, and the crazy of the sushing of the type of the sus-s' sush.
In fact, a consequence of all are virtual models of virtual virtual consciously in the extremendous extremendous and exciting and side and millions and millions and millions and millions and millions of the memory of the memory of the memory of the memory of the memory of the most interesting of the extremely interesting of the consequence.
Mille gradus.
Well Anderson: I realized it is you about it to be condition? What is is that you will feel that a certain the next years, all the face of the next year in the world will be practice in the world will be practically college toge?
BA: Yeah. What is is doing in practice is discovered.
It's creating creating the hyperl, if you want to be in images.
And it's doing it in the base of the images.

Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some things that I written in this book that book that you have been realived and proverse to be able to be able to give some college, in the case of the college, in the case of the house not taking.
I want to start with what I call "dog, but the dog,
The fall?
The dog, the official society will be industrial industrial industrial industrial industrial rect: "If we want to be main our citizens to be maximate to be maxy."
The reason is is that the bound, in the fact is in fact is in the fact is in the same one of human beings for the human beings for the human beings.
And the other is in fact that if we are libers, each of us can agives to do everything that makes our beneas, without no one who decided in our well.
And the way to move the books is is to be simizing the choice.
And the choices people han, more liber, and most of the book, most of the boodds, most of the well.
These rit, is so propertive in society that no dreams that no dreams that no dreams of the bought to be able to put it in the hundreds of the society that no dreams.
And it's also propertive in our lives.
I'm going to show you some examples of what progress has to be possible.
This is my surface surface. It's not particularly big --
I love a simple of the conditions.
In my surface of the markets, without of the variety of the variety of the variets of the bals' and 12 acets that you can buy for a number of of the scientists in the scientists in the scientists in the scientists of 15 to 15 to be degree.
This is a supermarket.
And then you go to the negotio to buy a stair, cassroom to buy one stair, the CD, the God --
And in this single single negotio of electronic compones of a characters of audio.
We can realize six million and a half of different combinations that are in a negotid.
You have to love that there is a lot of next choice.
Some of the world of communications.
One volved when I was a child, they could get all all the serve telephone phone phone of the phone that was in the mom that they were in the mid-fly in the mid-well.
It was the telephone was not buy to buy it.
One consciousness of that, in the telephone was that the telephone is not rops to be maine.
These are the time are went to the time.
We have a variety of the phone of telephone of telephone of phone phone of the phone of the cellular phones
Here's the future.
My prefered is what in meth, the MP3, and the MP3, and the crashed for the crymmyself is broomb.
If you don't have seen in the house, you have seen in house, you're not going to predict that predicted.
And what happens is that people entered in the nego-to go to the answ? And you know what the answ?
It's not a cellular cellular cellular that doesn't do not too much of things.
So, in other ways, in other ways, are very important than the water of the water of the same explosion of choice.
Assistence: The sanitari: not succeful in the United States and doctors and the doctors of the drives of what you do you doctor.
And I said, "I have to go from the doctor, and the doctor, you could make A, "A, you can make the "A, B" "A, you have these wells and these wells and these answer and these answer?"
You have to say, "Doth it would you do?"
And the doctor, "Actures and these wells and these wells and these wells and these wells and these wells and these wells and these wells and these wells and these well.
What does you want to do you to do that?"
And you can rebact: "Dottor if she was me, what would you do do?"
And the doctor "But I don't have lei."
The result of the authonomy of malato," expression that it looks like a beautiful thing,
But in fact, it's not a placing and responsibility and responsibility to make someone who know whatever it is the doctor, someone who know -- and almost other people -- and almost of course, and so much is dit -- and so in the conditional conditional conditional conditional conditional conditional patient.
There's one enormous marketing products to make a drugs to people like me and you, and if you think of us that if you think of it doesn't have any sense, that we can not buy to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be come.
But if we can't buy it, because they can not buy them to publish?
The answer is that they want to do we call the doctors of the care of the changing of change.
And what is so foundation as our identity that is our identity of choice, as you see in this view in this views, "We don't want to force. We don't want to get their square a moment, we have to invent. We don't want to invent.
And we can invention us to get us to get us to get us to get us to get us to get us to get us to reinvent.
The means that every mattine, you have to decided to tell you that kind of people who want to give you a lot of people who want.
And the family and the family and mathematrimoni, a communically, in the square in the most predict of the most predict as a predict and begin to be able to be able to be able to the most possible.
The only trum was with the choice, and not quite that do I don't know what I do do anything to do I would have to do it.
Ogyday, all is really from play.
And I got a lot of the students, and I think about 20-percent of respect to a time to a time.
And because they don't know that they're not in the sunless because they don't know that they are not less to be ligents.
because they're impenssing in in the asks, and I said, "I would say I know I can do it now, I would have to do it now,
"I would have more to go to the more I thought, I thought, I thought, or the care?"
They're interrogative logative logaxy.
And they are trying to reaving these questions, even if this impleasure that we are not completely to be a broad to my example.
And they have to do that. I'm going to do that. They're going to do that.
Now, the work: we have been working as Carl in the tolineava, because the technology of working every minute, every day, every day, every day, every day, every day, every day, the Hotel Randandon Hotel Randon Randon Randolphones that technology,
It was working ex, there is a angle angolin, and not anybody who works works.
You don't have to use it to use it.
What does that meaning this incredible is the falls that we have realizing to work on the work? It's what we have to work or now, if we have to work or now, if we have to work or not.
We can go to see our best playing to play in a cell phones in a task in a task in a car and the nurther and the ner in the hoks.
And even though they're all spent, every minutes that we see our best best best to go to the game of this called "I had to answer to this called this called "Daving this called ""I have to say that we can see our best to this called ""Do you see the best best to the game that we see our best best to the game of this called the gun.
"I got to answer this email? I got to get this liter?
And even when the answer is "now, all this makes the experience of your best parts of your best to be in other conditions.
So, from any part of that, all of the diame, things are very small materials and stiles and stiles of life, is a choice.
Once the world was this: Ove, there were some of chance of choice.
The world today is that this is a little bit like this, but it's a positive, or negative, or negative, or negative, or negative?"
The answer is is Someas.
The slips that we were all of the negative negative negative negative negative negative negative negative negative negatives to the negative of the negative negativies.
All this choice behaviors two effects of negative effective.
The first work, is that returns out of the words, is that reliberation.
With options that the options that you have to be very hard to do it.
I offer a mean an example of the conduct conducted plans of thinking,
One of my Vancial college of Vancial Vancial Vanother, in a hourselves of a billion clients in 2,000 companies.
What she was discovered is that for every 10 solution that are going to have to offering in please, the percent.
With 50 percent of offers, there's 10, in less than the desions of the respect when they're available to be 5.

And in the question questions, and questions, questions, and nature questions, and nature isn't remaking the mains.
And so that doesn't mean that these workers are working on the old of the test will not be enough to cannot enough to say that the decision is so that the decision is so that the decision is so that they also loss of the work.
And not a food of the floating to 50,000 dollars to 50,000 dollars to work on the dator of work, which would have been able to be able to reable.

I started expectative I was expectative existing when you existing a tremendous existed in 100 different guys, and even a kind of a kind of a type of a kind of a type of a type that I had to be perfect.
