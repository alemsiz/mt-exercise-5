<unk> year, I showed these <unk> <unk> that the <unk> <unk> <unk>, which for almost three million years had the size of the United States <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> of 40 percent.
<unk> this <unk> the <unk> of the problem because it doesn't show the <unk> of the ice.
<unk> <unk> <unk> is, in a way, the <unk> heart of the global climate system.
It <unk> <unk> and <unk> in summer.
The next <unk> is going to be a <unk> <unk> on the last 25 years.
<unk> <unk> are <unk> in red.
And you see, it's <unk> to the blue <unk>.
That's the ice in <unk>, that <unk> summer.
You can see that the <unk> ice <unk>, of five years or more, it's like the blood here, which here <unk> from the body.
In 25 years it, so that.
This is a problem because the <unk> are interested in the <unk> ground <unk> around the ocean, where there are huge <unk> of <unk> <unk>, are <unk> in <unk> <unk>.
<unk> to the <unk> <unk> <unk>, that <unk> could <unk>, that <unk> could <unk>, this point of not <unk>.
In some <unk> <unk>, the <unk> is already <unk> from water.
The <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> with a <unk> <unk> <unk> last <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>! <unk>: You're good. The question is, if we <unk> it.
And that's a reason that is that this <unk> <unk> <unk> from the north.
This is a river in <unk> <unk>.
<unk> never had <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This is the <unk> <unk>, in the <unk> of <unk>.
If you want to know how the <unk> is <unk> <unk> <unk> on <unk>, here is where the <unk> <unk>.
These <unk> are <unk> <unk>.
<unk> other part of the planet: <unk>, the largest <unk> of ice on the planet.
<unk> month, <unk> scientists, who <unk> the <unk> of ice is in <unk>, and that the <unk> <unk> on some <unk> <unk>, is particularly <unk> in <unk>.
<unk> at six feet of the <unk> level, like in <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, the third largest <unk> of ice, you see new <unk>, that a few years ago were <unk>.
<unk> 40 percent of the world's population <unk> water from that <unk>.
<unk> <unk>: This <unk> is the <unk> of the water <unk> of this city.
<unk> is <unk>.
But when you <unk>, the same happens to the water.
<unk> <unk> <unk> 40 percent.
<unk> <unk> are in the crisis.
<unk>, as you read, are <unk>.
<unk> <unk> in the world leads to a <unk> increase in <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> are <unk> to a <unk> out of the normal and not <unk>.
Sometimes, <unk> over the last 30 years of <unk> <unk>.
This is a <unk> of the whole <unk>.
If you look in the <unk> context, you can see the <unk>.
In the last five years we've <unk> 70 million <unk> of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million <unk> in the oceans.
Look at the <unk> area, from the <unk>, from the <unk>, to <unk>, and both of the <unk> <unk>, where there is a <unk> <unk> of oxygen in the oceans.
The major cause of global <unk>, together to <unk>, which is 20 percent, is the use of <unk> <unk>.
<unk> is a problem, and <unk> is even worse worse.
The United States is one of the two countries with <unk> <unk>, together with China.
And it was building a lot of other <unk> <unk>.
But we're starting to a <unk> of a <unk> of direction.
These are the projects that are in the last years and some <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
And so, there's a <unk> policy in our country.
<unk> <unk> and oil <unk> <unk> million dollars in the last year to <unk> <unk> <unk>, which is a <unk>.
<unk> picture me --
<unk> <unk>, in <unk>, where I live, there was a <unk> of <unk> billion <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
You may have seen it on the <unk>.
This is the <unk> <unk> in America.
It's happened around <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> of one of the <unk> <unk> was this.
<unk>: <unk> â™« <unk> <unk> is a <unk> and happy.
It's <unk> here in America, and it makes our economy.
<unk> <unk> is <unk> and more <unk>.
It's <unk>, <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> it.
<unk>: From the <unk> here, a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The largest <unk> society on the <unk> is <unk> <unk>. This is his <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk> -- Al <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> -- they don't know what they're talking about.
<unk>: So <unk> for the <unk> <unk> <unk> two <unk>.
This is one of them, one part.
<unk>: <unk>: <unk> we see the <unk> changes as a <unk> <unk> to our business.
That's why our <unk> is <unk> a big amount of money in a <unk> <unk> to make public and <unk> the truth.
But actually, <unk> isn't <unk>.
We think it's <unk> -- it also <unk> <unk>.
So we don't know about climate change.
We want to do that.
<unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk> -- you've heard a lot of it.
So we <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk>! <unk> are a little <unk>, but this is the sound of the <unk> technology.
<unk> <unk> is between the major <unk> of global <unk>, but <unk> technology that you see changes everything.
Let's look at this. This is the <unk> <unk> technology.
<unk>: <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk> to the economic issue and the national security.
<unk>: <unk> is in the crisis; America is the national security.
The <unk> that <unk> all of it: our <unk> <unk> from the <unk> <unk>, like <unk> and the <unk> oil <unk>.
Now, <unk>, there's a new, <unk> solution to <unk> it.
<unk> America: 100 percent of <unk> energy in 10 years.
A <unk> plan for America to work, <unk> more <unk>, and help <unk> global warming.
<unk>, a solution that we're going to <unk> to solve our problems.
<unk> America. <unk> more.
<unk>: This is the last one.
<unk>: <unk> energy to America.
One of the most <unk> ways of <unk> <unk> to the <unk> that <unk> our planet.
<unk>: The future is here. <unk>, sun, a new <unk> network.
<unk> <unk> 2: <unk> <unk> for jobs <unk> <unk>
<unk>: <unk> America. It's time to be <unk>.
<unk>: A old <unk> <unk> says, "If you want to go to, go alone.
If you want to go far, you go. "
We have to go far, fast.
Thank you very much.
<unk> year at TED, I did an <unk> on <unk>.
And they're trying to <unk> about how the car works.
So, I'm here. And for those who didn't have, the <unk> is the largest scientific experiment that's ever been <unk> -- <unk> miles of <unk>.
<unk> is to <unk> the conditions that were in less than a <unk> of a second from the beginning of the universe -- to <unk> million times a second.
This is just <unk>.
This is the <unk> machine.
They <unk> these <unk> <unk> into the <unk>.
This is what I work on. It's called <unk> -- it's <unk> <unk> feet and it's <unk> feet.
This is a <unk> picture of <unk> in <unk>, so you can see the <unk>.
<unk> <unk> last year we <unk> the car for the first time.
And this picture was <unk> by <unk>.
It was a <unk> <unk> in the control room.
It's an image of the first <unk> particles that he had all done the <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, with a part of the <unk>, and <unk> particles inside the <unk>.
In other words, when you <unk> the <unk> 10 <unk>, I <unk> that the car <unk>, which is a great <unk>.
I don't know if it was to <unk> us more or that, when somebody <unk> on Google and I knew that the <unk> page was this.
That means we've had a <unk> impact beyond the scientific one.
And I was a week later, there was a problem with the car, it was just like these <unk> here -- these <unk> <unk>.
These <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> when the car works at the <unk> <unk>.
Now, the <unk> between you are going to <unk> <unk> and <unk>, "It's not true. I'm too <unk>."
And they can do that because when they're very <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
So <unk> degrees, at least <unk> degrees, at the <unk> temperature at the <unk> of the space between stars, these <unk> can bring that <unk>.
In one of the <unk> between the <unk> <unk>, there was a <unk> of <unk>.
So the <unk> <unk> <unk>, and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a electric <unk>.
This was the <unk>.
Now, this is even more <unk> if you think that these <unk> <unk> more than 20 <unk>, and that <unk> about 30 <unk>.
They <unk> about 50 <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, what we did.
We <unk> them and <unk>.
They're now <unk> to their <unk> place.
<unk> the end of <unk> the <unk> will be again.
We <unk> it, and we try to get some data to <unk> or <unk>, and continue so our <unk> to discover what are the <unk> that are <unk> that <unk> the universe.
Now, of course, in a way, these <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> of science and engineering engineering of <unk>. It's easy to <unk>.
I think the fact that it's so hard, the fact that it's so hard, the <unk> of things like <unk>.
I'd like to end with the words of a <unk> <unk>, who, <unk> <unk> of the <unk> experiments of his <unk>, his <unk> was Michael <unk>, he said, "No," <unk> that's so <unk> for the <unk> of the human mind as the ideas of science are <unk>, that there are no <unk> in nature, that there are no <unk> in nature, that our <unk> are <unk>, and that there are not a new <unk> <unk>.
Thank you.
I want to start <unk> <unk> to when, from children, <unk> <unk>.
As we were <unk> as <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk>, <unk>, it really <unk> to think and <unk> problems and <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> to the way we <unk> most of the world around us.
So, as a <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of our <unk> with <unk> objects, together to my <unk> <unk>, and my <unk> <unk> <unk>, I started <unk>, I started <unk>, I started <unk>, "And if we use a computer, instead of the <unk> <unk> as a digital <unk> that moves on a <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with <unk> information with both with the hands,
and <unk> <unk> to our <unk>?
The question was so interesting that it was going to be <unk>, building the <unk>.
In a few words, a <unk> is a computer <unk> as a <unk>.
In a few words, a <unk> is a computer <unk> as a <unk>.
You can <unk> them with their hand, they can <unk> their <unk> and feel their movement and have a screen and a <unk> <unk>.
But <unk>, they're <unk> objects, like <unk>, can just <unk> <unk>.
<unk> are the example of a new tools to <unk> the digital information.
And as they become more <unk>, <unk> of the <unk>, others, and as they become <unk>, they become <unk>, of their <unk>, they're <unk>, they can explore new and <unk> <unk> of <unk>.
<unk> with some simple examples.
This <unk> is <unk> to show: if you put it in a direction, the video will be <unk> like this, you can see it in a direction, you'll get back.
These <unk> <unk> are <unk> of others.
If you <unk> them, they <unk> what's them around.
If they're <unk>, they can <unk> it up and they can <unk> a little bit.
If they're <unk>, they can <unk> it up and they can <unk> a little bit.
They also <unk> their movement and <unk>.
And then we realized that one of the interesting <unk> <unk> was that we could use common <unk> on data, for example, "<unk>" a color like a <unk>.
In this case, we have three <unk> <unk> as a <unk> <unk> and I can <unk> to <unk> color in the central, where it <unk>.
and I can <unk> it to <unk> color in central, where they <unk>.
We'll get too too much of it.
There are also <unk> possibilities of <unk>, like <unk>, mathematics and games where people can try things, and <unk> the results of the <unk>, and <unk> the results immediately.
Now, I'm --
This is a sequence of <unk> that I do with a <unk> program.
Here we have a <unk> of words that is half <unk> and <unk>.
<unk>, at every <unk> <unk> a letter on every <unk>, <unk> to every <unk>, <unk> to every <unk> <unk> a letter on every <unk>, and while we were trying to <unk> words, he <unk> on a <unk>.
Then, after about 30 seconds, you get a new <unk> of <unk> and new possibilities to try.
Thank you.
So here is a little kids in <unk> at <unk> <unk>, I did the way I <unk> them and <unk> a video.
They're very very much.
And one of the interesting things about this kind of <unk> is that you don't have to give people many <unk>.
They just say, "<unk> <unk> of words," and they know what to do.
Here we have other people who <unk> it.
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, there right.
It actually wanted to <unk>.
They were just <unk>, for him.
Now, this is a <unk> of a <unk> <unk>.
We wanted to build a tool for the <unk> of <unk>. He's <unk>.
It can <unk> new characters in the scene, it <unk> their <unk>.
It can <unk> new characters in the scene, it <unk> their <unk>.
So, he's doing the sun.
<unk>: The sun is <unk>.
David <unk>: Now he brought a <unk> in the scene.
<unk>: The <unk> <unk>.
<unk> work! Yes!
So, <unk> <unk> and <unk> can <unk> the characters --
<unk>: <unk>!
<unk> your story.
<unk>: <unk>!
<unk>: It's a story with the open, and it can decide him as they <unk>.
<unk>: It's a story with the open, and it can decide him as they <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> away, <unk>.
<unk>: The last example I have time to show you is a <unk>, made of a recent <unk>, and <unk> music.
It's a <unk>, made of the <unk>, that's <unk>, <unk> and <unk> music.
The <unk> here are <unk> as a <unk>, <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> of these have four different <unk>, and you can choose which I use.
You can also <unk> these <unk> in a sequence from <unk> to your <unk>.
And they just <unk> a <unk>, <unk> a sound and a sequence.
These are the effects that you can control live, like <unk> and <unk>.
I'll <unk> it to a particular sound and then <unk> to <unk> it.
And then there are <unk> effects, as time and <unk>, that's <unk> to the entire sequence.
<unk> how it works.
<unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Now, I'm going to take a <unk> line.
<unk>: <unk> <unk>: Now I'm going to <unk> <unk>...
<unk>: <unk>: And now I'm going to <unk> the <unk> to the <unk>, so I can control the effect of live.
<unk>: <unk>: I can <unk> the whole sequence <unk> the time on one hand.
<unk>: <unk>: And now we're going to get the <unk> <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> the sequence of the flight.
So I don't have to <unk> before, but I can <unk> it, <unk> longer.
And now, finally, I can <unk> the whole sequence <unk> <unk> left the <unk> <unk>.
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is to build new <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to how our brain work.
And today, I've had time to show you one of the results of this <unk>, and some possibilities that we try to bring out of the lab.
And the concept that I want to <unk> is that it's <unk> this new generation of <unk> objects to <unk> the <unk>, that we're going to do that information in our world in the way we want.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the time I'm going to talk to all of you.
I'm a <unk>.
<unk> books is my <unk>, but it's more than that, of course.
It's also love and the <unk> of my life.
And I don't expect it to be change.
But, I said that, something particular happened in my life and my career, which has led me to the whole <unk> with this work.
The particular thing is, I <unk> wrote this book, this <unk> called "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And the result is that it's going to be <unk> now, people <unk> me as if I <unk>.
<unk> -- <unk>, <unk>!
I'm going to go back to me, and they say, "You don't fear of being able to do better than that?
You don't fear them continue to write all the <unk> for life without being able to create a book that could help help us? "
What can it do? "
It's <unk>, you know.
But it could be worse, except I remember, over the years ago, when I started to tell people -- I was an <unk> -- I wanted to be a <unk>.
I <unk> to the same <unk> <unk> from fear.
And people said, "Don't you know, don't know you don't know you don't know you don't have a <unk>?
You don't fear that <unk> <unk> you?
You don't fear to do this <unk> for all life without anything to do with nothing out and dying on a <unk> of <unk> dreams with the mouth of <unk> <unk>? "
So, you know.
The <unk> is the <unk> answer to all these questions is, "Yes."
Yes, I fear of all those things.
I've always had fear.
And I'm also afraid of many other things that people couldn't <unk>.
Like <unk> and other things <unk>.
But, I'm going to write that I thought and <unk> <unk> is why?
Is it <unk>?
It's <unk> that anybody who <unk> <unk> to be <unk> by a job that you feel used to be <unk> by a job that you're <unk> to do.
But what is so particular, in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in a way that other <unk> don't do that?
How would my father, for example, he was a <unk> <unk> and I don't remember one time in his <unk> in the 40 years of <unk> in <unk> where asked if they were to be <unk> <unk>?
There was never -- that <unk> of the <unk> John, how do that?
<unk>'t that that, <unk>?
<unk>, engineers as <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, they certainly don't have certainly <unk>, in <unk>, <unk> the <unk> of being <unk> <unk>.
We <unk>, we have enough this <unk>, and not just <unk>, but <unk> of all sorts, we have this <unk> of being <unk> <unk>.
And it's not going to be looking at the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> that, only in the <unk> century, <unk> young people and often by hand.
And the ones that don't seem to be really <unk> by their <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, before he said, "Every last <unk>," my book, "<unk> me a little more," One extraordinary <unk> about the work of their lives.
But we don't know when we were saying because we've heard these things so long that we have all these things so long that we have completely <unk> and <unk> the <unk> that creativity and <unk> are in some ways <unk> and the art at the end.
And the question I want to <unk> all here is, you know, I'm going to agree with this idea?
I'm going to well that, because it's also <unk> by a <unk> distance to me.
I think it's <unk>.
And I think it's also <unk> and I don't want to <unk> <unk> in the next century.
I think it's better to <unk> our great <unk> <unk> to live.
And I certainly know that, in my case -- it would be very <unk> to start <unk> to <unk> to that <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> where I am in my career.
<unk> -- <unk>, look, I'm pretty young, I've got 40 years.
I still have about four <unk> of work in me.
And it's very <unk> that anything that's going to happen in then, it will be <unk> by the world like the work that after <unk> <unk> of my last book.
<unk> <unk>, because we're all more or less friends here -- it's <unk> that my greatest success is to my <unk>.
Oh, <unk>, what!
You know, this is the kind of thinking that leads to to <unk> <unk> at nine to the nine in the morning, and I don't want to do that.
I'm going to continue doing this work that I love.
So, the question becomes, how?
And so it looks like, after many <unk>, that the way to work to write is what you create a <unk> <unk> <unk>, OK?
I have to have to be able to find a distance away from <unk>, which I'm <unk>, and the natural <unk> on what <unk> wrote to get to do. And, while we were going to go through time, looking for other societies to see if you could look through time, looking for other societies, and see if you could have better ideas and see if you could have better ideas and see if you could have better ideas and see if you had better ideas and see if you
about how to help people <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity.
And that research led me to the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
It's because they <unk> in <unk> and then <unk> back.
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> -- people don't believe that creativity <unk> from men, OK?
And it was that that creativity was <unk> <unk> and <unk> to men from some <unk> <unk> and <unk>, for <unk> and <unk>, for <unk> reasons and <unk>.
<unk> <unk> these <unk> <unk> of creativity. "
<unk>, <unk>, <unk> we have a <unk> <unk> <unk> from far.
<unk> were the same idea, but they had the <unk> of the spirit without a <unk>.
That's <unk>, because <unk> didn't really know that a <unk> was somebody particularly.
I thought that a <unk> was this sort of <unk> <unk> that <unk> literally in the <unk> of a <unk> artist, a little bit like <unk> <unk>, and that <unk> out to <unk> the artist's work and <unk> the <unk> of that artist and <unk> the work out of that work.
<unk> <unk> <unk> you from the <unk>, the distance I'm talking -- that <unk> <unk> you from the results of your work.
And everybody thought that was so that we were <unk>, right?
So, artists were <unk> by <unk> things, like the too <unk>, right?
If your work was <unk>, you didn't <unk> all the <unk>, everybody <unk> that was <unk> by this <unk> <unk>.
If your <unk> work, it wasn't all your <unk>, right?
Everybody <unk> that was your <unk> to be a <unk>.
And so people are <unk> <unk> creativity in <unk> for a long time.
Then the <unk> <unk> and everything, and we <unk> this great idea; we put the human center on the universe, all of the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and not leave space to <unk> creatures that <unk> <unk> from <unk>.
This was the <unk> principle of <unk> <unk> and people who think that creativity is <unk> from <unk>.
And for the first time in history, they <unk> to <unk> this one or the artist to a rather than a person with the <unk>.
And I have to tell you, I think it was a big <unk>.
I think you can somebody, one simple person to believe that they're like a <unk> like a <unk> like the source, the <unk> and the <unk> of all the <unk> <unk>, <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> is a <unk> <unk> too big to <unk> human <unk>.
It's like asking someone to <unk> the sun.
<unk> and <unk> completely the <unk> and it creates these <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk>.
And I think it was this pressure to <unk> artists in the <unk> 500 years.
And, if that is true, and I think that's, the question of becomes, and right now?
Can we do that?
We can go back to a more <unk> understanding of the relationship between human and <unk> <unk>.
Or maybe not.
We may not <unk> 500 years of thinking about 18 minutes.
And there are probably some of the audience who <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on their <unk>, <unk>, do you know, <unk> people <unk> <unk> <unk> about their projects.
You probably don't <unk> all about this.
But the question I'd like to ask you is -- why not?
Why don't we <unk> that way?
Because it makes more sense of anything that I've ever heard to explain the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> process.
A process that, as anyone who ever <unk> to do something -- so, basically, everybody here -- knows, you know, don't <unk> <unk>.
And, in fact, it can sometimes look completely <unk>.
I did this <unk> <unk> with the extraordinary <unk> <unk>, which has now 90 years old, but it was a <unk> for all life and said that during his <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk>, <unk> out in the <unk> <unk>, <unk> out in the fields, and <unk> it, within a <unk> <unk> from <unk>.
And he said, "It was like a <unk> <unk>.
And that <unk> <unk> to her <unk>.
I could get it, because he was <unk> the land under its feet.
<unk> we had one thing to do to do to that point and was in, he said, "<unk> like a <unk>."
And so he went to home and he came from this <unk>, and he wouldn't have to do anything else that we take a piece of paper and a <unk> enough <unk> to the page.
<unk> times not to be quick, so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> without able to get home to and <unk> the <unk> through the <unk> and she would <unk> the <unk> through the <unk>, looking, and she said, "another <unk>."
Then there were those times -- this piece was never going to -- there were moments when it was almost <unk>, OK?
So, he was coming back home and was looking for paper and <unk> the <unk> through, and he <unk> a <unk> right in the <unk> that he was <unk>, and she was, and she was, and she was going to be able to <unk> the other hand and <unk>.
He <unk> the <unk> from the tail and the <unk> in his body and the <unk> on the page.
And in these cases, the <unk> would be <unk> on the <unk> page, but <unk>, from the last word to the first word to the first word to the first word to the first word to the first word to the first.
So when I <unk> him -- it's <unk>, it's exactly <unk> to my <unk> process.
Not all my <unk> process -- I'm not a <unk>!
I'm a <unk>, and my way of <unk> is; I love at the same <unk> every day and <unk> and <unk> to work on the <unk>.
But even I, in my <unk>, I <unk> against that thing, sometimes.
And I'm also also going to say that many of you the <unk>.
You know, even if the work and ideas I <unk> from a certain source, I couldn't <unk> <unk>.
And what is this thing?
And how can we <unk> it in a way that we don't have your head, but rather, what do you <unk> <unk>?
As I'm going to, the best example of the <unk> <unk>, which I've been <unk> different years ago for a <unk>.
I was talking about this, and you know, <unk>, for the <unk> of life is the <unk> of the artist <unk> <unk>, trying to control, <unk> these <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
But then <unk>, he was <unk> up, and one day while she was <unk> on a <unk> <unk>, he <unk> all for him.
<unk> <unk>, <unk>, and all of a <unk> <unk>, that comes into his head as <unk>, <unk> into his head as <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, and wants, you know, it's wonderful, and <unk>, but it doesn't know how to <unk>.
It's not a <unk> of paper, it's not a <unk>.
So it starts to feel this kind of old <unk> <unk> <unk> in him, like, "I'm going to lose, and <unk> <unk> from this <unk> song.
I'm not enough <unk>, and I can't <unk>. "
And instead of going to <unk>, they <unk>.
He <unk> the whole <unk> process and did something completely new.
He just <unk> the sky and said, "<unk>, don't you see I'm <unk>?"
"Do you seem to write you?"
If you really want to <unk>, you'll be more <unk> when I can take care of you.
<unk>, <unk> to <unk> more today.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. "
And his <unk> process <unk> <unk> after this.
Not the work, it was still <unk> as always.
But the process, and the <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> was <unk> when he <unk> the <unk>, the <unk> that he <unk> out of the other problems and <unk> it back where it was, and it <unk> it back where it was, that it didn't have to be a <unk> and <unk>.
but it was <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> a conversation between <unk> and this <unk> thing that <unk> and <unk> <unk>, but it wasn't <unk>.
So how I was going to change that story to change a little bit of the way I <unk> and I'm going to be <unk> once.
This idea, I was <unk> when I was <unk> "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and I went into one of the <unk> that we're all working on something and we're doing with something and we're not going to do that, and we're not going to do you, that what the <unk> <unk> book would ever written.
Not just <unk>, just <unk> the book written.
And I started thinking about <unk> this project.
But then I <unk> to <unk> that I <unk> to <unk> and <unk>.
So I <unk> my face up from the <unk> and <unk> my <unk> to a <unk> <unk> of the room.
And I said high <unk>, "<unk>, what, we know that if this book is not going to be <unk>, don't it be <unk>, right?
Because as you see, I'm <unk> all I have, I don't have any more of that.
So if you want it to be better, you have to <unk> and do your side.
OK. But if you don't do it, you know what, I'm going to <unk> anything.
I started writing the same because it's my work.
And I would like to say it was <unk> that I <unk> to do my part "because -- at the end is like that, OK -- <unk> does in the <unk> Africa of North Africa, people <unk> to <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> to the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and music that they were going to <unk> for hours and <unk> hours to the <unk>.
And they were always <unk>, because the <unk> were <unk> and <unk>.
But every once, <unk>, something <unk>, and one of these <unk> artists actually <unk>.
And I know what I'm talking about, because I know you've seen it all, at some point, a <unk> like this.
It was as if time <unk>, and the <unk> <unk> through a sort of <unk> and it wasn't doing anything different from the <unk>, like <unk> <unk> before, but everything was <unk>.
And all of a sudden we don't just <unk> as a human.
But it <unk> from <unk> and <unk> <unk> into the <unk> of the <unk>.
And when this <unk>, at the time, people <unk> what was, he <unk> him with his name.
<unk> your hands and <unk> to <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, God," God, "God."
That's God, you know.
<unk> <unk> <unk> -- when the <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the <unk>, I <unk> this <unk> with them and the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> from "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, which you can still feel in the <unk> or the <unk>.
In <unk>, when an artist has done something impossible and <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>," <unk>, <unk> -- a <unk> of God.
And it's <unk> because we need to do that.
But, the problem comes the next day, for <unk> itself, when they <unk> and <unk> that are the 11 <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> of God doesn't have more.
It's just a <unk> <unk> with <unk>, and maybe never <unk> to the <unk>, and maybe never <unk> to the <unk>.
And maybe no one <unk> the name of God still <unk>, and what does it have to do with the rest of his life?
It's hard.
This is one of the most <unk> <unk> to do in a <unk> life.
But maybe it doesn't have to be so <unk> if you can't believe, <unk>, that the most <unk> of your being come to yourself.
But it just <unk> that you have data from a <unk> source of this <unk> part of your life that you have to go to <unk> somebody else when you're finished.
And, you know, if we think it's all change.
And so I started <unk>, and it's certainly how I <unk> it for several months during the <unk> of the book that I was soon, the <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> of my success.
And what I have to keep <unk> when I feel like this is, I'm not afraid fear.
Don't <unk>. You just don't get your work.
<unk> to <unk> for your side, any one can be.
If your work is <unk>, <unk>.
If the <unk>, <unk> <unk> to you <unk> <unk> <unk> some kind of <unk>, for one moment through your <unk>, then through your <unk>, then "<unk>!"
<unk>, do the same your <unk>.
And <unk>! "<unk>!" <unk>! "
I think, and I think it's <unk>.
"<unk>!" <unk>! "<unk>" <unk> "<unk>" <unk> "
Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk>: <unk>!
As you know, I talked about some of these projects about human genome, what can <unk> and <unk> new <unk> of genes.
We're going to <unk> a new path: we started <unk> biology and now from that digital code we're <unk> into a new <unk> of biology, <unk> and <unk> life.
We always tried to <unk> them big questions.
"What is life?" It's something that many <unk>, I think they have <unk> to understand at various levels.
We tried different <unk>, <unk> to <unk> <unk> terms.
We're <unk> for almost 20 years.
When we <unk> the human genome <unk> to go from the <unk> world of biology to the digital world of the computer.
Now we're going to <unk> life, or create new life from this digital universe?
This is a map of a little <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, which is the <unk> species from the <unk> genome between those that can <unk> into the lab.
And we tried to reduce <unk> <unk> the genome to <unk> one even smaller.
We're able to <unk> a <unk> of about 500 genes that are here.
But when we look at the <unk> map, it's just <unk> <unk> to our own own <unk>.
<unk>, that's simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can <unk>, one at one time, it's very <unk> that this can bring a <unk> cell.
So we thought that the only way to <unk> was <unk> this <unk> to <unk> the <unk> to <unk> some of these questions.
So we started the <unk> of "<unk>, can we <unk> a <unk>?"
Can the chemistry <unk> of producing these great molecules that we've never been able to create these great molecules that we've never been able to create these great molecules that we've never been able to create these great molecules that we've never been able to create these great molecules that we've never been
And, in case, can we make a <unk>?
A <unk> is just a piece of <unk> material.
The speed with which we're able to <unk> life is <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Our ability to write the code, instead, <unk> rather slowly, but it's <unk>.
And our <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We <unk> over 15 years ago.
The process has <unk> a lot of <unk>, <unk> with a <unk> <unk> before they <unk> the first experiments.
But we found that DNA <unk> is very difficult.
There are <unk> of thousands of cars in the world that <unk> little <unk> of DNA <unk>, <unk> <unk>, and it's a <unk> process. The <unk> is a <unk> process, the <unk> is long, the <unk> there are.
So we had to develop a new <unk> to <unk> these <unk> and <unk> the <unk>.
And this was our first <unk>, starting from information digital information genome in the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's a little <unk> that <unk> bacteria.
We designed the <unk>, we designed the <unk> and <unk> a <unk> of DNA around <unk> <unk>.
The interesting part is when we took this piece of <unk> <unk> material and we <unk> it into the bacteria, the bacteria have <unk> to read this code and <unk> the <unk> particles.
<unk> <unk> <unk>.
I talked about the recent <unk> industry that they've <unk> that they've certainly <unk> this model.
They have more than you.
And it's a situation that software can actually build the same <unk> in a <unk> system.
But we could do the biggest things in the <unk>.
We wanted to build the whole <unk> of the <unk>.
They are more than <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> code.
So we thought we'd be <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> of the virus, so that we can change the <unk> to understand what the <unk> <unk> are.
<unk> is <unk>, and if you <unk> information with the computer, they must be very <unk>.
When I first <unk> this genome for the first time in <unk>, the standard <unk> was a <unk> for every 10 <unk> <unk>.
We discovered, <unk> <unk>. If we were using that original sequence, you never could do that.
One part of the process is designing <unk> <unk> 50 <unk> with all the other <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> to build smaller <unk> <unk> that <unk> together.
<unk> elements here.
You've probably read that <unk> us from <unk>.
<unk> <unk>: We have a <unk> code that's four <unk> <unk>: A, <unk>, <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> of those <unk> <unk> <unk> together about 20 <unk>, and there's a <unk> order for every <unk>.
So we can use the code for writing words, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
What we did we started is <unk>.
Some of them were <unk> by the fact that it wasn't <unk>.
We designed these <unk> <unk> to <unk> by just <unk> with <unk>.
There are <unk> that we <unk> them and <unk> them.
And we started to <unk> <unk> of the parts, <unk> with <unk> from five to seven <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> them to them <unk> <unk>.
At every step, we've made these <unk> <unk> so that we're trying to create a very <unk> <unk>, as you'll see in a minute.
We're trying to <unk> the process.
So, this seems the <unk> of a <unk> <unk>.
When I started these very <unk> <unk>, more than 100 <unk> <unk>, we don't get <unk> directly into the <unk> <unk>.
It's <unk> <unk> of the <unk> tools of <unk> biology.
So we <unk> some other <unk>.
<unk> of another <unk> called <unk> <unk>, which in biology <unk> to <unk> the DNA that we can <unk> the <unk>.
Here's an example.
This <unk>, called <unk> <unk>, can <unk> three million <unk> <unk>.
You can see in the <unk> <unk> as his <unk> is <unk>.
And in 12 -- 24 hours, it's <unk> as a <unk>.
<unk> thousands of organisms that are able to do this.
These organisms can <unk> completely.
We had to live under <unk>.
I'm absolutely sure that life <unk> in space, and they <unk> to find new <unk> of water.
Actually, NASA showed that this happens.
This is an image of the <unk> we built using these <unk>, just using these <unk>, just using the <unk> with the <unk> <unk> design.
The <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This is not <unk> with a <unk> <unk>, but with a <unk> <unk>.
It's such a <unk> <unk> that we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk>.
These are pictures that <unk> a period of about six seconds.
This is the <unk> we've done little time ago.
They're more than <unk> <unk> of <unk> code.
It's the largest <unk> of a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> by man.
It's got a <unk> <unk> at 300 million.
If you <unk> it with a <unk> 10 and no spaces, you'll just take pages to <unk> this code.
Now, how do we work? How can we <unk>?
<unk>, of course, is a kids game.
It's a little bit more <unk> when you use bacteria.
It's <unk> when it comes to the <unk> cells like our: you can just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> another, which is basically the process of <unk>.
In <unk>, we <unk> the <unk> is instead <unk> into the cell, but we've <unk> <unk> that we're able to do a <unk> <unk> from one another cell to another and <unk>.
We <unk> a <unk> <unk> from a species.
The two are the <unk> of the <unk>.
We <unk> some <unk> in a more <unk> way that we can decide which to <unk> for this <unk>.
And then he <unk> with <unk> so that they <unk> all the <unk>.
And when we put it into the cell, it was <unk> and <unk> our <unk> <unk> the new <unk> went into the cell.
And we had <unk> that we didn't go beyond, but we tried to <unk> more in there.
This is one of the major <unk> of evolution.
We discovered that <unk> species have <unk> a second or a third <unk> somewhere, <unk>, <unk> in a second thousands of new <unk> to that species.
So those who think about evolution as one <unk> at the time that <unk> doesn't really understood part of biology.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> that was in the cell, we didn't get one.
The <unk> <unk> we <unk> it.
It's <unk>, and it <unk> the other <unk> as <unk> material, <unk> it, and we <unk> with only the cell and the new <unk>.
It's become blue because of the genes we've <unk>.
And in a short time, all of the <unk> of a species have gone <unk>, and it <unk> of all sorts are in a new species, <unk> on the new software that we <unk> in the cell.
All the <unk> are <unk>, and when you <unk> the code that we <unk> the code, you know, what we've <unk>.
Now, this may seem <unk> <unk>, but <unk> the software, we can change the software enough.
Now, I've already <unk> that we're not talking about <unk> -- but of progress from three and a half million years of evolution, and I said that maybe we're going to create a new version of the <unk> <unk> that we <unk> new species on this digital process that we're going to create new species on this digital process.
Why do that?
I think it's pretty <unk> when we think about our <unk>.
We're going to go from six and a half billion people to <unk> billion in the next 40 years.
Just to give one example: I was born in <unk>.
Now there are three people on the planet to <unk> in <unk>; in the <unk> 40 years, there will be four.
We're <unk> problems now to find food, <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> for six billion people.
We'll even have to do it for nine billion billion.
<unk> over five billion <unk>, over 30 billion <unk>.
That means 100 million <unk> a day.
When we try to find <unk> <unk>, or any kind of process to <unk>, it's going to be a huge challenge.
And we have to realize that all the <unk> of CO2 from these materials that we <unk> into the atmosphere.
At the time, because of the <unk> <unk> in the world, we have a <unk> with about 20 million genes, and I like to think that are <unk> <unk> for the future.
The <unk> industry is just about a <unk> of <unk>, and think about how many different things are out.
Our <unk> here is <unk> data from reality and our <unk>.
We have <unk>, because of these <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> that we call <unk> <unk>.
We're able to build a big robot that can produce a million <unk> a day.
Think of the <unk> these 20 million genes or <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> to produce <unk> or <unk>, new <unk>, we can change, with a small team, and create more <unk> biology than in the last 20 years of science.
And it's just a standard <unk>.
We can choose to <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, chemistry or <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
This is a <unk> of some some <unk> software that we're working on to be able to <unk> and design species to the computer.
Well, we don't know how they will be.
We know exactly what their <unk> is like their <unk>.
We're going to <unk> on the <unk> <unk>.
You've seen that <unk> <unk> from the <unk> was a bad <unk> experiment.
We <unk> second and third generation that we <unk> quite soon from <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> as <unk> or different kinds of <unk>.
But the only way that biology can have a great impact without <unk> <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the <unk> would be <unk> CO2 in matter before, so we're working on to design cells that can reach that to be able to be able to have the first <unk> generation in about 18 months.
<unk> <unk> with CO2 is a <unk>, but in our <unk> of <unk> around the world, we found different <unk>.
This is a <unk> we <unk> in <unk>.
<unk> in the deep ocean, at about <unk> feet deep at the temperature of water <unk>.
They're <unk> by CO2 using hydrogen <unk> as a source of energy.
We're trying to understand if we can <unk> CO2, that can be <unk> by <unk> by <unk>, <unk> that CO2 in <unk>, to drive this process.
So, very short, we think we might be able to <unk> what the basic question, "which is what life is" we, we, we have the <unk> goal of <unk> the whole industry.
<unk>. If you can't do it from TED, where can you?
It's a <unk> of energy.
<unk>, we're working for the same <unk> to create <unk> <unk>.
You've seen this year with flu, we're always back a year and with a dollar <unk> when it comes to find the <unk> right.
I think that can be a <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk>.
That's how the future may begin to look <unk>, now, the evolution of bacteria, <unk> evolution with bacteria, <unk>, and finally <unk> cells.
We're so much about <unk> people.
Our goal is to make it a long enough of living enough to try to <unk> <unk>. Thank you very much.
So, I'm going to show you, the <unk> <unk> possible, some fundamental work of the new technology that we brought to <unk> <unk> to a <unk> almost a year ago. This is <unk>.
It's an environment where you can <unk> is on local level that <unk> with an enormous amount of <unk> data.
We're seeing <unk> <unk> <unk> with a kind of <unk> <unk> and <unk>, for a quick <unk>, <unk> the images like we want.
And it doesn't matter how big the amount of information that we see, how big <unk> are, or these <unk> are, or data.
Most of them are common, but this is a <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of <unk>, and <unk> in the <unk> of 300 <unk>.
It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that <unk> the <unk> of a system like this is the number of <unk> on your screen at any time. It's also a very <unk> architecture.
This is a whole book, example of data, not of images.
This is the <unk> <unk> <unk>. Every <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk>.
And so it's a <unk> that's <unk> and not of images, we can do something like that, to actually show that it's a real <unk>, not a picture.
It may be a little <unk> way to read a book.
I'm not going to show you.
This is an <unk> example. This is a number of <unk> <unk>.
Every picture is the beginning of a <unk>.
And it really gives you the <unk> and the beautiful experience of reading the real version of a <unk> or a <unk>, which is for nature a <unk> <unk>.
We also did something with this one of this particular number of the <unk>.
We created a <unk> <unk> <unk> much <unk> than that you use in a normal <unk>, and we <unk> the <unk> content.
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk>, you can see here.
Or some <unk>, even the <unk> <unk>.
And that's really <unk> some of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of space on the screen.
<unk> that <unk> to <unk> and other <unk> like that, you can't have to be <unk>.
Of course, <unk> is one of the most <unk> <unk> for this kind of technology.
And I don't want to lose time, if not to say we have <unk> <unk> to <unk>, even to say that we have <unk> to <unk>.
These are all the streets in the United States <unk> over the U.S. <unk> picture.
So now we're going to do something else.
This is actually live on the Web; you can see it.
This is a project called <unk>, which <unk> two different technologies.
One is <unk> and the other is a <unk> <unk> computer computer computer, really interesting that <unk> by <unk> <unk>, a student of the <unk> of Washington, with the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>. A <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And it's alive on the Web, <unk> by <unk>.
You can see when we do this kind of <unk>, where we can go from a picture and have this kind of experience <unk> <unk>.
But the <unk> <unk> of the images here has actually <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> of the computer <unk> these images together, so that they can <unk> to the <unk> places where the <unk> all <unk> near the <unk> <unk> <unk> have been <unk>. Here you see some <unk> of a <unk> or <unk> <unk>, and these things are all <unk> <unk>.
I don't know if I have time to show you some other environment.
There are much more <unk>.
I want to go directly to one of the <unk> of the <unk> data, and this is a <unk> <unk> of <unk> that we've done for the first time, I <unk> to show you what <unk> is really the key behind this technology, the <unk> technology. And it's not <unk> so much <unk> looking at the <unk> that we put up is really the key behind this technology,
We had to <unk> some <unk> and <unk>.
This is a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> images. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> of <unk> and so on. <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> a picture that's discovery <unk> to this model.
So, they're all <unk> images and you've been <unk> at the <unk> level in this way.
And it's possible to <unk> this <unk> way.
You know, I would never have thought of, in <unk>.
It's very <unk> to <unk> this kind of <unk> here.
I think you can see that it's a lot of different <unk>: from those cell phones to those <unk> <unk>, a <unk> number, <unk> together in this environment.
And if I can, I can, I can help try it.
A lot of them <unk>, etc.
<unk> some of this is a series of photographs here -- <unk>.
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We can go from the <unk> to the <unk> <unk> of this environment.
The <unk> point is that we can do things with the social environment. This is <unk> data from <unk> from the whole memory of how to <unk> the earth, from the <unk> <unk>, from the point of view and <unk> <unk> all that data together.
All of those pictures become <unk>, greater than the <unk> of the parts.
You have a whole model of the <unk> land.
Think of this as the <unk> of the work of <unk> <unk> <unk> on Earth.
It's something that <unk> in <unk> complexity as people <unk>, and the <unk> <unk> for those who are <unk> <unk> with the use.
Their pictures are <unk> with <unk> <unk> by other people.
If somebody comes the idea of <unk> all these <unk> <unk>, my name is, my picture of the <unk> <unk> <unk> all of that data, and I can use it as a <unk> <unk> <unk> in that space, using the <unk>, using the pictures of anybody else, and having a social experience kind of <unk> and <unk> social experience.
Of course, a <unk> of all of that are extremely <unk> models of every interesting part of the land, not only from <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> images and similar, but from <unk>.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Do I understand? What your software <unk> to do is, at some point, in the next few years, all the photographs <unk> from anybody in the whole world will be almost <unk> together?
<unk>: Yes. What's doing is basically <unk>.
It's creating <unk>, if you want, between pictures.
And it's doing it, it's <unk> to the content of images.
What becomes very interesting if you think about <unk> information <unk> that a lot of these <unk> images.
As you do a <unk> of images on the Web, you <unk> a <unk> and the <unk> on the Web has a lot of information about the pictures of the picture.
Now, what happens if that picture <unk> all of your picture?
So the amount of <unk> <unk> and the amount of <unk> <unk> that <unk> is really enormous. It's a <unk> effect of the network.
CA: <unk>, it's really incredible.
<unk>: I'm going to leave you very much.
One of the major <unk> when you <unk> and one of the <unk> research <unk> is that we can live in the <unk> of the <unk>, the past of the wind, the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of plants.
You may think that <unk> <unk> still <unk> beyond <unk> <unk>, or that the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> are still <unk> of <unk>, or that in <unk>, the <unk> <unk> still the <unk> of the <unk>, to remember the <unk> <unk>, and that the idea that the world in which we live in in the <unk> sense, and that the idea that the world we live in in the <unk> of the <unk> that we're not in the <unk> of the way we live exists in the <unk> exists that we we we don't exist in the world, we
the <unk> of a particular <unk> of <unk> choices that our <unk> did, good or bad, a lot of <unk> it.
And, of course, all of the <unk> <unk>.
Everybody <unk>. <unk>.
We're <unk> to <unk>.
We have to deal with the death <unk>, so we won't <unk> it if we <unk> and <unk> --
We all have a art.
What <unk> is the <unk> of the song, the <unk> of the <unk> of every culture.
It doesn't matter that it's the <unk> of the <unk>, or the <unk> <unk> <unk>, or the <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, or a <unk> in the <unk> of <unk>.
He was my <unk> journey in <unk> a month ago, or a <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>'s mother's <unk>.
All of these <unk> <unk> that there are other ways of thinking, other ways of thinking, other ways of moving in the world.
And if you <unk> a minute, it's a concept that can give you hope.
<unk>, the <unk> <unk> of the world create a <unk> of <unk> life and <unk> that <unk> the planet and is important for <unk> of the planet as the <unk> <unk> <unk> as <unk>.
And you can think about this <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and you can <unk> the <unk> of all the <unk>, the <unk> of all the <unk>, dreams, ideas, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> in being by the human imagination of consciousness.
<unk> is the <unk> <unk> of humanity.
It's the <unk> of what we are and what we can be as <unk> species.
And <unk> <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, for example, <unk> that 50 percent of all species has been or is on the <unk> of <unk>, because it's <unk>, or <unk> -- in the <unk> of <unk> diversity -- and it doesn't even <unk> to <unk> <unk> -- that diversity of <unk>.
The <unk> of that is, of course, the <unk> <unk>.
When you're <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on this planet.
A language is not just <unk> by a <unk> or a series of rules <unk>.
A language is the <unk> of the human spirit.
It's the middle of the middle of every culture is coming in in the material world.
Every language is a forest of the mind, a <unk>, a <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
And of those <unk> <unk>, while we're sitting here at <unk>, at least half isn't <unk> in the <unk> of children.
They're not <unk> to children, which means less than <unk> something, who are already death.
What's more <unk> than the <unk> of being <unk> by the <unk>, of being the last to talk about a language, not to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> or <unk> the children's <unk>?
This <unk> <unk> is a <unk> of somebody in a part of the world every two weeks, that every two weeks, a <unk> <unk> and <unk> it <unk> with the <unk> of a <unk> language.
And I know that somebody of you say, "<unk>'t that better?
The world wouldn't be a better place if we could all the same language? "<unk>, then we're talking all about.
<unk> <unk>.
<unk> of a <unk> thing is, it's not to be able to talk about their language.
And I'd like to do you today a journey through the <unk> --
a small journey in the <unk> to give you a <unk> of what we're <unk>.
Many of us are <unk> that when I say "different ways of <unk>," I mean really different ways of <unk>.
So, for example this <unk> <unk>, in <unk> <unk>, the <unk> of the <unk>, which <unk> to the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's a <unk> that it's not able to <unk> the blue color from the <unk> because the time <unk> is <unk> in the forest, where the <unk> is <unk>.
They have a <unk> language and a <unk> rule, <unk> "<unk> <unk>": you have to <unk> a person who is talking a different language.
And that's all that <unk> in the past <unk> is that in these <unk> families, in which they talk about six or seven <unk> because of the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
You go up to listen and then you go to hear.
And I'm one of the most interesting <unk> that I lived in, the <unk> <unk> <unk>, an incredible <unk> that had the first <unk> in <unk>.
In <unk> five <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk>.
They made <unk> from the top photographs that <unk> them in <unk> <unk>, <unk> that this <unk> <unk> forest <unk> never seen anything.
They <unk> the pictures from the ground, and they <unk> them to <unk> a form or <unk> and, not <unk> anything, they <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk>, and they <unk> the five <unk> with the <unk>.
But <unk> don't just <unk> the <unk>.
They're <unk> to each other.
<unk> percent of the <unk> was <unk> by their own.
We went to eight <unk> and we found two <unk> of death, and when we <unk> to know, they <unk> that one of them was so <unk> <unk>, and then they <unk> it. And then they <unk> it the same. [<unk>] At any way, they had a <unk> knowledge of the <unk>.
The <unk> were able to recognize the animal <unk> from 40 <unk> and <unk> the species.
<unk> years early '<unk>, I was <unk> a very interesting task, when my <unk> <unk> <unk> me if I wanted to go to <unk> between the society <unk> at the base of <unk> and <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> of the <unk> <unk> to do it.
To give a sense of <unk>, I should understand the <unk> culture, and the <unk> isn't <unk> <unk>.
It's pretty much of a <unk> view of the world.
<unk> <unk>.
If you ask you to <unk> the world's <unk>, what do you <unk> me?
<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, etc.
A continent comes out, thinking that Africa doesn't have <unk> <unk> <unk>. And instead, yes, and the <unk> is not the other than the <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> during the <unk> <unk> of <unk>.
What makes interesting is the <unk> relationship between life and death.
So <unk> are <unk> <unk>.
<unk> can be <unk> by the <unk> <unk>, <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the live in so that for a <unk> moment, the <unk> becomes the <unk>.
That's why <unk> <unk> to say, "<unk> <unk> go to the <unk> to talk about God.
We <unk> in <unk> and <unk> God. "
And from the moment that you are <unk>, is the spirit that <unk> you, how do you get you <unk>?
So, they <unk> to these incredible events: <unk> <unk> in the state that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a rather <unk> of the power of the mind, when it's <unk> in a state of <unk> <unk>.
<unk> all the <unk> that I lived with the <unk> <unk> are the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, in the <unk> <unk>.
<unk> of the <unk> civilization that once <unk> on the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk>, the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk>.
In a blood continent <unk>, this <unk> never been <unk> by <unk>.
And today, I'm <unk> by a <unk>, but their training is <unk>.
The young <unk> are <unk> away from <unk> to <unk> <unk>, and they live <unk> in a world that they made of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> for 18 years.
Two <unk> of nine years <unk> of the way that we <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>.
For all this time, they're <unk> to the values of their societies, values that they <unk> and just their <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or to say <unk> <unk>.
At the end of this incredible <unk>, they're <unk> out and for the first time in their life, they see an <unk>. And in that moment of the first <unk> of the first <unk>, when the sun comes to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, everything that they've learned in a <unk> theory of all that they've learned in a <unk> theory of all his <unk>. The <unk> does a <unk> <unk> back and says
"<unk>? <unk> like I said.
It's <unk>. Now it's <unk>. Now it's <unk>. "
They are <unk> <unk> and say we, <unk> <unk>, we are the <unk> of the world's <unk>.
This <unk> level is extremely important.
When we think of <unk> <unk> and the <unk> environment and the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, which is a <unk> concept in its <unk> or maybe <unk> and say that these <unk> are <unk> to the Earth.
The <unk> <unk> are not <unk> or <unk> from <unk>.
There is no space for these things in the <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk>, but because of time and <unk>, they created a <unk> of the Earth's <unk> <unk> not on the concept of <unk> <unk> <unk>. But on a <unk> <unk> <unk>. It's a <unk> <unk>, the concept that the Earth can only live because it is <unk> by the human consciousness.
What does that mean?
It means that a <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> <unk> that the mountain is a <unk> of <unk> that <unk> its <unk> is going to be a <unk> <unk> and will have a very <unk> different and will have a <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> that a mountain is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> that <unk> that a mountain <unk> <unk> to be <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk>.
What's interesting is the <unk> that <unk> the relationship between the <unk> and the natural world.
I grew up in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that the <unk> <unk> to be <unk>.
That made me a human being different from my friends who believe that <unk> are the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> that live in the <unk> <unk>.
If we try to <unk> that these <unk> can create reality, they start to understand some of their <unk> <unk>. They have to start to understand that <unk>.
I <unk> this picture in <unk> in the <unk> <unk>.
Maybe some of you have heard about <unk>, the most powerful <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk>.
What makes <unk> <unk> is not the <unk> potential of the <unk> of the <unk>, but its <unk>. It's <unk> by two elements.
On one hand, this <unk> <unk> a series of <unk>, <unk> <unk> and <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
<unk> the only one has a <unk> <unk> that <unk> a little bit, but it's <unk> with the <unk> of a <unk> of the family <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This <unk> has <unk> <unk>, very similar to <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
If you ever see the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk> that make a different <unk> of the <unk> that <unk>.
<unk> that <unk> on the <unk> is a little bit like being <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a sea of electricity. <unk>'t create a <unk> of reality; it creates the <unk> of reality.
I often <unk> with my <unk>, Richard <unk> <unk>, the man who <unk> the <unk> was <unk>, with his discovery of the <unk> <unk> in the '<unk>.
And my <unk> is not going to <unk> these <unk> <unk>, because if you're done you can't tell anybody to be <unk>. <unk>, they can't be <unk> because they're <unk> by a <unk> that's <unk> of course in <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
It's possible to <unk> <unk> only if you <unk> with other <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Now the <unk> is the <unk> that are in this <unk> are <unk> of <unk>, the same kind of necessary <unk> to <unk> the <unk>. <unk> question: A <unk> <unk> question: in a <unk> of plants, how these <unk> <unk> <unk>, how do these <unk> <unk> <unk> two <unk> don't similar, but that if you <unk> in this way, they create a <unk> <unk> that's <unk> to the <unk> of the parts?
We use the great <unk> of <unk> and <unk>, that can <unk> <unk>.
But if we go to the <unk>, we say, "The plants talk about it."
What does that mean?
This <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the forest, and that our eyes will be in the forest, and our eyes are going to the same species.
If you tell them how they <unk> their <unk>, "<unk> <unk> <unk> of plants, of the rest of the rest of you don't know everything?" I said, "No."
The solution is: you take the <unk> <unk> in a night of moon <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> with a different <unk>.
With that you don't <unk> to <unk>, but it's much more interesting than <unk> <unk>.
Now, the problem is, even those of us who have heart <unk> <unk> them, but somehow <unk> to the <unk> of the history of respect our real world, and it <unk>.
In fact, the <unk> century, in 300 years, <unk> <unk> for its <unk> or its <unk> <unk>, but rather the age we <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> the mass of the <unk> diversity and <unk> on the planet. Now the problem is not the change.
All the <unk> through the <unk> have been <unk> in a <unk> for new possibilities of life.
And the problem is not technology.
<unk> <unk> have no <unk> to be <unk> when they put <unk> <unk> and <unk> as they put out of <unk> and <unk> as they <unk> <unk>.
It's not the technology or technology that <unk> the <unk> of <unk>. It's the power.
The <unk> <unk> of <unk>.
And if you look at the world, I'll see that these are not <unk> <unk>.
They are <unk> creatures, and they are <unk> creatures out of the <unk> forces that go beyond their <unk> capacity.
<unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> --
a <unk> <unk> of <unk>, in <unk> <unk>, a <unk> that has <unk> free free free in the forest to a generation ago, and now we go to the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>,
<unk> <unk> <unk> with the <unk> <unk> with the <unk> <unk> to the forest.
Or, in the <unk> case, are the diseases that are <unk> with the <unk> discovery of <unk>.
If we <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk>, where I'm doing a lot of research, you'll see the <unk> of the political <unk>.
As a <unk> <unk>, <unk> physics of a <unk>, is <unk> at the <unk> level, but <unk>, <unk>, the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk>'s life, not only is is <unk>, but <unk> in certain <unk>, because it's part of the development of <unk>.
And you can't understand the <unk> of the <unk> until it comes from the beginning.
I <unk> <unk> miles from <unk> in the <unk> China through the <unk> <unk>, <unk> to <unk> with a young <unk>, but only got to <unk> what's behind the <unk> I realized what was behind the <unk> I was talking about.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> million people <unk> from the <unk> during the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The father of this guy was <unk> to the <unk> <unk>.
That means that it's been <unk> to the Chinese <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk> during the <unk> that <unk> that led the <unk> <unk>.
My mother was <unk> and her <unk> was to be <unk>.
It was taken of <unk> in <unk> at age two years, under his <unk>, because he couldn't have to live without him.
The <unk>, who did the same, was <unk> in <unk>.
One day, she <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> for this <unk>, was <unk> to the <unk> work for seven years.
The <unk> pain can be <unk>, but the <unk> <unk> <unk> is from present.
And then, all of that, it <unk> to a choice.
Do we live in the <unk> world, or we want to <unk> the <unk> world of diversity of <unk>?
The great <unk> <unk> <unk>, before he died said that his greatest fear was that his greatest fear was that, in our going to this <unk> view of the world, not only <unk> the whole <unk> of the human imagination to a <unk> <unk> of thinking, but a day we <unk> from a <unk> <unk> <unk> that there were other possibilities.
And it's <unk> to remember that our species is <unk> for <unk> years.
The <unk> <unk>, which has given us agriculture, which made us <unk>, which <unk> us to the <unk> <unk> <unk> with the <unk> of <unk>, creating the <unk> of <unk>, creating the <unk> of <unk>, creating the <unk> of <unk>, and we talk about <unk> years ago.
The <unk> world has <unk> 300 years old.
That <unk> story, I didn't know, I'm going to have the answers to all the challenges that we can <unk>.
When we <unk> the world's <unk> to what it means to be human, <unk> with <unk> different <unk>.
And it's in these answers that we all <unk> the possibility of being what we are, sort of <unk>, that it has to make all the <unk> and all the <unk> can be <unk>. And there are great moments of <unk>.
I <unk> this picture on the <unk> <unk> of <unk>, when I went to <unk> <unk> with <unk>, and this man, <unk> me the wonderful story of his <unk>.
The <unk> government has not always been <unk> with the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> of this man is <unk> of <unk>.
The family, <unk> for his life, the <unk> <unk> all the <unk>, and all his <unk>.
You want to know that <unk> don't know the cold, we'll <unk> it.
The <unk> of <unk> <unk> fish were made of <unk> fish <unk> in <unk>.
The <unk> of this man didn't <unk> from night or <unk> <unk>.
It's <unk> away, it <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> into your hand. When I did it, they <unk> it up, it <unk> them up, they <unk> them up, they <unk> them up and they <unk> them into a <unk>.
He <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk> of <unk> and when <unk> <unk>, <unk> a dog.
He <unk> the dog and created a <unk>, and he created a <unk>, and he <unk> another dog and she <unk> on the <unk>, <unk> <unk> in <unk>.
Do you talk about <unk> with anything?
<unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> government <unk> to the total control of an area of a bigger <unk> area of <unk> <unk> and <unk> together.
It's their new <unk>. It's called <unk>.
It's a <unk> <unk>. It's <unk> all the resources <unk>.
One <unk> example of how a <unk> can <unk> with his <unk>.
And, finally, I think it's pretty <unk> at least at least, who is in these <unk> areas of the planet, <unk> that they're not at all.
For somebody is home.
<unk> <unk> of the human imagination that we <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk>. And for all of us, the dreams of these children, they become part of the <unk> of hope.
And finally, we <unk> <unk> that <unk> never <unk> to anything.
<unk> that <unk> --
They're not <unk>, but we believe that stories can change the world, and maybe we're the best <unk> to tell the stories of the world. Every month our website <unk> <unk> million <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> our <unk> <unk>.
Our <unk> are <unk> by millions of people.
Our work is <unk> in <unk> to bring our audience to <unk> our public in places to <unk> <unk> from which <unk> <unk> from <unk> how they saw and, they <unk>, <unk> for the <unk>, the <unk> world in diversity, and we have to find a <unk> life in the <unk> world, and we have to find a <unk> life in the <unk> world, and we have to find a <unk> <unk> world
where all the <unk> of all the <unk> can <unk> our <unk> <unk>.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope is <unk> other you've heard and <unk> some <unk>, in case you've not seen them.
I want to start with what I call the <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> of what?
The <unk> <unk> of all the society that is called "If we want <unk> <unk> <unk> of our citizens," The way to do that is to <unk> the freedom to <unk>. "
The reason is, on one hand, in fact that freedom, is itself, in fact that freedom, is useful, <unk>, <unk> for humans.
On the other one is that if we're <unk>, each of us can act to realize to do everything that we're going to <unk> our <unk>, without any <unk> in the name of our.
The way to <unk> the freedom is to <unk> the choice.
The more choices, the people are more <unk>, and more their freedom, the <unk>, the <unk> is their <unk>.
This is, <unk>, it's so <unk> <unk> in the society that no one <unk> to <unk> in <unk>.
And it's also <unk> <unk> in our lives.
I'm going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible.
This is my <unk>. It's not particularly big.
I'm going to give me a simple note about <unk>.
In my <unk>, there are <unk> <unk>, without <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> and the 12 <unk> <unk> that you can buy a huge number of <unk> in the <unk> <unk> that no one of the <unk> <unk> in <unk> that no one of the <unk> <unk> is to your <unk>.
This is what <unk> is like.
Then you go to the <unk> store for buy a <unk>: <unk>, <unk> <unk>, radio, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
And in this single <unk> store, there's a big number of <unk> <unk>.
We can do six million different <unk> using the <unk> that there are in one <unk>.
<unk> <unk> that there is <unk>.
<unk> fields: the world of <unk>.
Once, when I was a child, you could get all the <unk> <unk> <unk>, to <unk> that they were <unk> by <unk> <unk>.
You <unk> the phone, you don't <unk> it.
One <unk> of that, by the way, was that the <unk> never <unk>.
These days, they went.
We have a <unk> almost <unk> <unk>, especially between phones.
So here are cell phones.
My <unk> is in the middle, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> for <unk> <unk>.
If you're not still seen it in the <unk> store under the house, you're very few <unk> <unk>.
And what is at the end of it is that people <unk> in <unk> and this question, and you know, what is the answer is, "No.
It's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn't make things.
So, in other <unk> of life that are much more important than <unk>, they are <unk> the same <unk> of choices.
<unk> <unk>: It doesn't happen in the United States you're going to go to the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> you what you have to do.
Instead, <unk> from the <unk>, and the <unk> says, "OK, we could do A, or <unk>," A, or <unk>, "A," or <unk>, "A," or <unk>, "A," or <unk>, "A," or <unk>, "A," or <unk>, "A," or <unk>, "A," or <unk>, "Oh,
You <unk> them, "<unk>, what do you want to do?"
And the <unk> says, "<unk> has these <unk> and these <unk>, and <unk> <unk> these <unk> and these <unk>."
"What do you want to do?"
And you said, "<unk> if you were, what would you say?"
And the <unk>: "But I'm not her."
The <unk> <unk> we call it "<unk> <unk>", "<unk> <unk> that makes it look like a beautiful thing.
But it's actually not that one <unk> the weight and the responsibility for making a <unk> of somebody who know something, <unk> the <unk>, to <unk> <unk>, to <unk> somebody who has to <unk> that nothing -- and it's certainly not <unk> -- and so it's not in the <unk> to make the patient.
There's a huge <unk> of <unk>, <unk> to people like me and you, that if you think about it doesn't make sense, because we can't <unk>.
But if we can't <unk>, why do we <unk> them?
The answer is, they want you to <unk> what we call the <unk> <unk> to <unk> the <unk>.
<unk> so fundamental, as a <unk> is that we have a question of choice, as you see in this <unk>. "We don't want to <unk> the kids. We don't want to <unk> the kids. They don't <unk>. We have to <unk> the kids. We don't have to <unk>.
And we can <unk> how many times we're going to do that.
That means that every <unk>, at <unk>, you have to decide what kind of person you want to be.
<unk> to the family and the <unk>, a common time perspective, <unk> the common time perspective, <unk> almost anyone who was as soon as possible, and they start to <unk> the <unk> as soon as possible.
The only real choice was with those, not when, and even what to do after.
<unk>, it's really to play.
They <unk> to students very smart, and they <unk> 20 percent work <unk> respect to a time.
And not because they're <unk>, not <unk>, because they're <unk>.
But why are they <unk>, they're going to ask <unk>, "<unk> or not?"
"<unk> <unk> later?" I have to think about <unk>, or <unk>.
They're <unk> <unk>.
And they try to answer these questions, even if this <unk> doesn't get the <unk> that they <unk> and not get a good <unk> to my <unk>.
And they have to do that. They're important questions.
Now, the work: we're <unk>, as <unk> <unk>, because the technology allows us to work every minute, every day, from every corner of the planet, <unk> that from the <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, there's a <unk>, and I won't say anybody, where the <unk> works.
I don't tell you, because I want to use it.
What does that mean, this incredible freedom of choice that we have about work? Is we have to decide, <unk> at any time, if we have to work or not.
We can go to see our child, play a <unk>, with the <unk> in a <unk>, the <unk> in the other, and the <unk>, <unk>.
And even though I'm <unk>, every minute we see our son, <unk> the <unk>, we're also <unk>, "I have to answer this call?"
"Do I have to answer this <unk>?"
And even when the answer is, no, "that makes the experience of your son very different than what would be in other conditions than that would have been in other conditions.
So, from any part of us, small things and big objects, materials and <unk>, life is a question of choices.
Once the world was this: <unk>, there were some possibility, but it wasn't a matter of choice.
The world today is going to talk about this: <unk> is, "Is it a <unk> thing, or <unk>?"
The answer is <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> we all know, so I'm going to talk about the <unk>.
They <unk> that choice is two <unk> of the people that are <unk>.
The first one, <unk>, is that it <unk> instead of <unk>.
With many <unk> between which you choose, it becomes very difficult to do it.
So I'll give you an example of <unk>: a study <unk> <unk> <unk>.
A <unk> of my <unk> has access to <unk> data, <unk> <unk> society, with <unk> <unk>'s <unk> <unk> <unk> in different companies.
What she discovered is that for every 10 <unk> that are <unk> in more, the <unk> <unk> <unk> of two percent.
With 50 <unk> <unk>, there's 10 percent less <unk> than <unk> when they are only five. Why?
Because with 50 <unk> between which <unk>, is <unk> difficult to decide, and <unk> is <unk> <unk>.
And <unk>, and again in <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and of course, <unk> never comes.
<unk> that doesn't just mean that these <unk> <unk> <unk> food to <unk> because they don't have enough money, it also means that the decision <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
They're not going to be <unk> to five <unk> per year from work, which would be well <unk> to <unk>.
So <unk> is a <unk> of having <unk> choices.
And I think it's going to be the world.
"And finally, what about, for <unk>, <unk> or <unk>?"
It really <unk> the right decision, if it's for <unk>, right?
You don't want to choose the wrong bottom, and <unk> the wrong <unk>.
So that's the first effect. The second is, even though we can <unk> <unk> and make a choice, at the end, we're less <unk> from the <unk> of how you <unk> states with <unk> between <unk>.
And that's why we're going to be different reasons.
One of them is, with a lot of <unk> between which, if you take one and not perfect, is easy to imagine that they could make a different choice that would have been better. And what's happening is that the <unk> <unk> <unk> us to <unk> the choice, and the <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> by the decision,
even when it was a <unk>.
More choices there are, more easy, it's easier to <unk> than any <unk> of choice.
<unk>, there is what <unk> call.
Dan <unk> has <unk> very well <unk> like the value that we give things to things that we <unk> with.
<unk> else, when there are many <unk> possible, it's easy to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and be less than the <unk> <unk>.
Here's an example. I'm going to tell you with all the ones that are not in New York.
But that's what we probably <unk>.
There's this <unk> to the <unk>.
A <unk> of <unk>.
<unk> <unk>. <unk> day. It's all about them.
<unk> nothing. But what he thinks is, "Well, <unk>, <unk>, it's <unk>."
"All my <unk> <unk> are away."
"<unk> <unk> right in front of the house."
And it goes through two weeks, it's going to <unk> -- every day -- the possibility of <unk> where it wants.
The <unk> <unk> for what we have, even when the choice was <unk>.
And the more are the <unk> we have from <unk>, the <unk> <unk> against how <unk>.
Here's another example.
This <unk> tells us a lot of things.
It's about living the moment, and maybe it's going to be slowly.
But the most important point is, whatever you say, you know, you're going to try not do other.
The things that don't know many <unk> that they can make less <unk> what we do.
<unk> <unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk>.
I tried it on my skin, a new <unk>.
It's almost always <unk>.
Once the <unk> were just one guy, I <unk> them and <unk> <unk>, they were <unk>, only after <unk> <unk> <unk> a life and <unk> a lot of times, they were going to well.
So, I went to <unk> a couple of <unk> when the <unk> <unk>, and I said, "I need a couple of <unk>, this is my <unk>."
The <unk> said, "Do you want to <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>?"
Do you want them to <unk> or <unk>? "
"Do them want to <unk>?"
"<unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk>? <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>..." <unk> <unk>.
I was <unk>, and after some of it. I got to say, "I want the guy who was the only guy that <unk> was," He didn't know what it was, so for a time, I <unk> all of <unk> <unk> <unk>, then <unk> me, then I <unk> <unk>, then I was <unk> <unk>, and I had ever had.
It was <unk>. With all that choice I had <unk> the best.
But it <unk> me.
Why? I wrote a whole book for <unk>.
The reason I was worse is, with all that choice my <unk> were <unk>, the <unk> <unk> to be <unk>.
I had <unk> <unk>. I didn't <unk> anything <unk> when I just had a guy, but when I had 100 different, it was a perfect.
What I had <unk> was good, but not perfect.
After I <unk> that we <unk> with what I was <unk> in <unk> to <unk>.
The <unk> of <unk> in the life of people don't make the <unk> that these <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> themselves.
And that's less <unk>, even when the results are good.
<unk> in the world of <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Because if I <unk> it, I don't know what I'm talking about.
The truth <unk> more to that.
"<unk> was better when you was worse." The reason why it was <unk> when you were worse was when you were worse was, when you were worse was possible to <unk> <unk>.
<unk>, in the world that we live in -- <unk>, <unk> citizens with the <unk> of <unk> -- the <unk> that we can <unk> is that things are <unk> to <unk>.
You never have ever ever <unk> <unk> because your <unk>, my <unk>, <unk>.
The <unk> of happiness -- what you're here -- is, "<unk> <unk>" Yes, "you want to."
I mean -- small moment <unk> -- I'm really <unk> and my wife is really <unk>.
I couldn't do better, I didn't have <unk>.
But <unk> don't always get a <unk> thing.
I mean, a <unk> of the buy a couple of <unk> <unk> when there's just that kind of <unk> is that when you're not <unk>, and I'll tell you, "Why?"
"Who is <unk>?" The answer is <unk>.
The world is <unk>. What could I do?
When there are hundreds of <unk>, and I'll get one <unk>, and I'll tell you who is the <unk>, it's clear that the <unk> is clear that the <unk> you.
They could do better.
With hundreds of <unk> available, there are no <unk> for <unk>.
So when people make decisions, even if the <unk> is <unk>, they're <unk> and give them to their own <unk>.
In the last few years, the <unk> is <unk> in the <unk> world.
I think a <unk> <unk> -- not the only, but important -- of this <unk> of <unk> is that that people have experiences because <unk> are too <unk>.
And when they have to <unk> this situation, they think that the <unk> is them.
So the end result is that in general we're better, <unk>, but we get worse.
Let me show you.
This is the <unk> <unk>, what we're going to take for good and it's completely <unk>. It's not true.
There is no <unk> that a little choice is better than <unk>, but from that not <unk>, but from that doesn't <unk> that much better than a little bit.
There's a <unk> value, <unk>. I don't know what it is.
But I'm quite sure we've <unk> from a piece the level in which the choices <unk> our life.
Now, from the <unk> point of view -- I almost finished -- from the <unk> point of view, <unk> is <unk>.
What it allows all this choice in <unk> society is the <unk> material.
There are many places in the world, and you know, <unk> <unk>, where the problem is not that they have <unk> choice.
The problem is they have too much <unk>.
So the <unk> I'm talking about is a <unk> <unk> of <unk>, <unk> <unk> society.
And what <unk> <unk> and <unk> is this: <unk> <unk> <unk> talked to you yesterday about how <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> are <unk>. It's a <unk> of money.
I mean that these choices, <unk> and <unk>, is not that just <unk>.
They're <unk> <unk>.
They make us worse.
If a little bit of what in our society allows <unk> to be <unk> in those where people have too few possibilities, it wouldn't just their life to <unk>, but also our own.
This is what <unk> call a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
A <unk> of the income is good at all -- not just the poor -- because of that choice in <unk>.
And so, "<unk>, you can become everything you want to --
<unk>, people of culture, <unk>, "What do that fish?"
"It's <unk> that you can't make anything in a <unk> of glass."
"A <unk> imagination, a <unk> view of the world --"
and I <unk> it like this, I <unk> it, at the beginning.
But then, I realized that that the <unk> knows the <unk> knows.
Because the reality of <unk> is that if you <unk> the <unk>, <unk>, so that "is all possible possible, you can't <unk> the freedom. It <unk>.
If you take the <unk> in a way that everything would be possible to <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Everybody needs a <unk>.
This is almost certainly too <unk>, maybe even for the fish, and certainly for us.
But the <unk> of some <unk> <unk> is a <unk> for <unk> and, <unk>, for <unk>.
Thank you very much.
