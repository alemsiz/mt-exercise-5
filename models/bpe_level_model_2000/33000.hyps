And last year, I showed these slide to demonstrate that the glacial calot, which for almost three million years, has had the size of 48 percent had the size of 40 percent.
This is the gravity of the gravity because it doesn't show the ice of the ice.
The artype is arty in is a certain sense, the clean heart of the climate cuter system.
You expand in the wversumer and you get right.
The next slide will be a couple of the 25 years.
The ice loens are signed in red red red red it.
You can see it in the blue down.
That's the ice in wrong wrong wrong in the winter wrong.
You can see that the cosidy glacious glacium, is like the blood or more, is like the blood of the body.
In 25 years was passed by like this, like this.
This is a problem because the interests of the array of the arts around the ocean around the ocean of artic carbon that there are huge quantity of carbon that sheet -- and sheet in metanhand the microbies.
Rispace at the total inquinner from the atmospher, that quickly could double, the amount could double, surface this is not returned to return out.
In some of the lakes, in Alaska deep in Alaska hand is already to water.
The professored professor. The University of Alaska has recated team in a team in the team in the wversus of last decade.
Video: Wow! Al Gore: She is good. The question is if we will be us.
A reason is that this exchange in the Groenland the Groenland from the north.
This is a glacial range.
The taken had never reached in the similar slights.
This is the Kangerlusaaq, in the southern Groenland of the Groenland
If you want to know how the level of the sky of the gaus of the gaus of the gather, here is where the sea.
These corrupty and rapidly.
On the other side of the planet: Antarcts, the largest block of the planet.
The last last months have dichiared that the balance of the ice is in negative negative -- and that Ancarctics in the negative onto some island in the submitty of the isols in the sheet.
It's quite a six feet of water, like in Groenland in Groenland in Groenland in Groenland in Groenland in Groenland in Groenland in Groenland in Groenland in Groenland in Groenland in Groenland in the Groenland in the broad.
On Himalaya, the third largest block of ice block ice, and they see the laghi, who were the glacia.
The 40 percent of the world required rements of the population of the point of the sheet.
One is the source of the field water is the source of this city.
The taken is increased.
But when you decreate the same across the same as a table.
In California the snowing on the Sierra Nevada is diminuth.
The ride of the ride of the rise of the key keys.
The predictions, like you read, are grave.
The growing growing world at a remarkable increasing increasings.
The disasters are increasing a rhythm out of normal and without precedenting precedenting precedenting preceding.
Four times more number of over the last 30 years of the previous respect to the precedenting the preceding of the previous number of years.
This is a game.
If you look at the context if you can see the consequences.
In the last five years we added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the oceans every day.
Look at the point of the oriental Pacific Pacific America, and the bottom, and on both the parts of the continent of the continent in the oceans.
The most of the global warming, with deforestation, together the deforestation, which is 20 percent, is the use of combust.
The oil is a problem, and the carbon is even worse worse
The United States are one of the two countries, together in the China.
And it was proposed to build a lot of other carbon die.
But we're seeing a change of direction.
These are the projects of annual projects in the last few years and some of the alternative alternative proposes.
Everyway, there's a lot of politics in our country.
The carbon industries and oil industries have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote the carbon is a obsible, which is a obsible.
This picture is reminded me to remind me --
Nath Natal, in the Tennessee, where I live it, there's been a 3.8 billion gap chories.
Maybe you saw that the news of the news.
This is the second largest flow of dioximating.
It's happened around Natma.
The natalian advertising industries was this:
Video: She does the carbon is a fallegrus.
It's abundant here in America, and it grows our economy.
Frosty carbonaio is increasingly clean.
It's precise price, lovely and workers keep the style stick.
Al Gore: From here is a lot of the West Virginia.
The largest society on the mountains is Massey Coal. This is his administrator.
Video: Don Blankship: I'll be clearning -- Al Gore, Nancy Pelos, Harry Reid -- they don't know what they're talking about.
Al Gore: So the Allance for the Protetion of Clim has launched two campaign of the countries.
This is a one of it.
Video: All right, "At COALering see the changes like a threat at at the time.
So our priority is to invest a lot of money in a public effort to make public effort and confused the truth, and confused the truth.
In fact, the carbon is not sport.
We think it's cleaned -- has a good profum.
So not preocupated.
Let me do you do it.
Video: All right, "Carbone -- you heard about a lot of talking about it.
So let's do a framework in a structure at the framework.
Straordinary cars are a little white romoring, but that's the sound of the charcoal technology.
The carbon is between the main causing the main causing global warms, but the notice technology of carbon that you see changing everything.
Go a look at the handwering technology.
Al Gore: Finally, the positive alternative positive is connected to the economic security.
Video: Comment: The America, is economy, the economy, security security climate crisis.
The filter that the college all of -- our dependence from the fossil fuel and the remote carbon and the important.
Now, there's a new audience, there's a new solution for using it.
By America: 100th of clean energy in dieckle dieckets in dieck diecks.
They plan to put America in work, to make it safer safer and help the stopping the global warming.
Finally, a solution that bast, you know, to solve our problems.
By America. It takes more than that.
Al Gore: This is the ultim.
Video: Comment: It's about to America.
One of the fast fast enhouse to dependence by the combustible combusts that kills our planet.
She s: The future is here. I sun, a new energy network.
She has 2: Novi investment for places to work of well.
M: Geter America. It's time to be realist.
Al Gore: A old old proverbbed says, "If you want to go to you, go to you, go to you, go to the sun.
If you want to go away, and go away, and you get together."
We have to go away, fast.
Thank you very much.
The last year at TED phect in the LHC.
And I promise to back to the way to go back to how the machine.
So I got it. And for those who are the other time wasn't her, the LHC is the largest scientific experiment, ever tried -- 27 miles of circus surrounded surrounded -- 27 miles of circus surrounded it.
Her comfortable is to realize the conditions that were present less than a billion in the beginning of the universe -- until over 600 million times a second.
This is just the environment.
This is the machine below Gineva.
We photographs these mini-Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Big Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang inside the red.
This is what I work. It's called ATLA, is four feet, and it's a 22 feet.
This is a spectacular image of ATLAA, you can see the proportions.
The 10 sevenemed to the last year, we have access to the machine for the first time.
And this picture was taken by ATLAS.
It was a lot of immenses in the control.
It's a picture of the first particles of particles that had done all the slide of LHC, and in collision, deliberately with a part of the LHC, and spread particles inside the LHC, and spread particles inside the relay.
In other words, when we see that picture the 10 of the settember 10 of the machine, we realized that the machine, which is a great liftye.
I don't know if it was to do that exact us more opposed to Google and saw that the page was this:
That means we had a cultural impact that scientific impact on the scientific impact.
About a week later, it was a problem with the machine, just had to these files here -- these sleeps here -- these dorates here --
These files are 13,000 feet, when the machine works in the powerful of the power.
Now, technical technical of you look at files, "It's not true. I'm too much. I'm not true. I'm too under the task."
And they can do it because when they're very coldful become the cosidic files.
So, at least 271 degrees, at a inferior in the space between the stars, these files can bring that body elect files can bring that body elevent.
In one of the most of the most of the magnets in the LHC, there was a fabrication.
So the files are surrished in the slide and 13,000 feet, suddenly met a resistance.
This was the result.
Now, this is even more impression, if you think that these magnets are over 20 tons, and that have moved over 20 percent imeters.
They are damaged about 50 magnets.
We had to take you, what we have to do it.
We have them repristine and add it.
They're now now now now they're all back to their place underneath the place of the underneath place to their place under banks.
English the end of the LHC will be new integrated in the ground.
We're going to accen, and we expect of data to get the right or him, and continuing so our adventure to discover what are the matters that are the universe.
Now, of course, in a certain fashion, these crash the dibate on the value of science and engineering. It's easy to confidence and engineering to confut.
I think that the fact that it's so difficult to go beyond the limits, I think that's the value of things like LHC.
I want to conclude with the words of a scientist Ingless, Humphenhy, where, where, image, in defense of inuseful inuseful experiments of his pupll, his clean was so dangerous for progress of the human mind as the human mind as the ideas that are definitive, in the ideas that are definitives, that are definitive in the trial concerns of the world."
Thank you.
I want to start asking you to rethink of it, and you play here, from children, playing with the morning.
While you realize them and reach them and spread them and slide them and move it, learning and you can do and resolve problems and resolve relationships and manipulating relationship.
The space is profound that is deeply connected the way we understand a lot of the world around us.
So, as informed by using the user of our interaction with physical objects, together my collaborator Jeevan Kalaniths, and my collaborator Jeevan Kalaniths, and when we use a computer, rather than the hundred digital with the gital hang on a desktop, we have the only the gital information with entities that moves on a desktop, we can have the skills
and to do it to our please?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer to the answer to Siftable.
In a few words, a Siftable computer is a big interactive computer in a little discover.
In a few words, a Siftable computer is a big interactive computer in a little discover.
You can move with hand, they can see it in their hands, and they have a skill and have a screen and a wireless.
But more of the point of of physical objects, as the matter to be simply to reat it.
The Sift-to-care example of a new ecosystem of instruments to manipulate the digital information.
And as we get more physical physical and the others, and the others, and as we have more physical physical and as we can become more physical and the other totally as we can exploring new style and and the fun of the interaction.
I'll start with some simple example.
This Sifty is configurated to show video -- if you including video -- if you including it in a direction, if you can go back to the other side back.
These interactive riticians are aware of the others.
If I realize them what they are interested in what they are around it.
If they are surrounded surround, they can agitate a little bit.
If they are surrounded surround, they can agitate a little bit.
They also have their movement and incline.
We realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was to use on the data, for example of the interaction that was a liquid.
In this case, we have three Siftable configurated as a swalks and I can use them to use them to the color, where they mix mix at the central central color.
and I can use them to cut them to the color in the central swalk.
If we can get a little bit of it, we can put a little bit of it.
There's also beautiful chance of learn, like languages, the mathematics and play logical and play logical and play the logical results, and see the immediately.
I'm now --
This is a Fibonacus, I do with a program of equations.
Here we have a word play that is in half between Scarabeous play.
Firstly at every turns a letter to every turn of home on every Siftable, Pratally, at every turns out to every turn on every turns on every Siftable, and as a certain diment.
Then, after about 30 seconds remissing and you have a new set of reading and new possibility to try to get to them.
Thank you.
Here's the children came to the Middle Lab, I made it so they tried them and I sent a video.
They are pleased a lot of it.
And one of the interesting things about this kind of application is that you don't have to give people a lot of education.
You just have to say, "The pones of words, and they know what to do.
Here's some other people who try it.
This is our most youngest bete, there on the right.
It actually wanted to be flip.
They just were bricking, for him.
Now, this is a application of a interactive card.
We wanted to build a tool for the apprentices of the Lui is Felix.
It can inserve new characters in the scene, relieving the Siftable and their associated associated with their associated with their associated with their associated associated with their associated with the scene, and it can inserve the Sift.
It can inserve new characters in the scene, relieving the Siftable and their associated associated with their associated with their associated with their associated associated with their associated with the scene, and it can inserve the Sift.
Here is doing that the sun of the sun.
Video: The sun is smigene.
David Merrill: He took a treat the scen.
Video: The treat.
Bel work!
So you get the Siftable and puts can interact the characters --
Video: Bau!
-- by inventing your story.
Video: Ciao!
DM: It's a story with final apet and can decide how you do do it.
DM: It's a story with final apet and can decide how you do do it.
Video: Gola,
DM: The last example I have time to show you is a instrument, realized recent and extent music.
it's a instrument, realized to sample and execk music.
The Siftable here of skills like battery.
Each of these has four different variations, and you can choose what to us.
You can insect these sound sound to your food to your food or pleasentence.
And modificar, just by touching a sound and a "sequence."
These are effects that you can controls from living, like reverse and the filter.
The attacks to a particular sound and then including it to add it.
And then there are the general effects like time and volume, which is apply in the sequence.
Let's look like it.
Video: DM: We're going to start with a two Sift," "sequence" -- we go into a series, the extendive, we go to a series, and we add the other basic fash.
Now I put a basic line.
Video: DM: I am now to be --
Video: Here I'm going to put the filter to the bacteria, so I can control the effect from live here.
Video: I know how to fast the whole sequence the whole sequence of the time from one side or the other.
Video: DM: And now I'll add the movie to give more expression.
Video: I can do know about the sequence "I can recombine the sequence of the volo."
So I didn't have to plan before, but I can improvise, but I can improve it, make it longer or the short and the cortas.
And now, finally, I can get the whole sequence inclining the whole sequence in the left of the volum.
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is building new interfaces and more and more more and more more and more more and more like our brain and body.
And today, I had time to show you one of the results of this percorn, and some possibility that we try to bring out the lab out of the lab out of the lab out of the lab out of the lab out of the lab out of the lab out of the lab out of the lab out of the laboratory of
The concept I want to transmit you is coming this new generation of designs designed by the media designer of digital objects that will be information in the way we want.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the hour of talking to all of you.
They're a writers.
Soring books is my profession, but it's more than that, of course --
It's also love and the fasck of my life.
And I don't expect that can change it.
But I said this, something particular is happened in my life, and my career and my career and my career and my career and my career and my career and my career and in my career and in my career and in my life, and I have to get the whole recent of my life, and my career and my career and my career and my career, who took me to recalibrate the whole recently recently re
The particular thing is that I recently written this book, this biography called "Mangia, Prega, Ama" -- what, in my precedents for some reason for for for some reason in the world and became a big sensational.
And the result is that everywhere now, people are treatment to me as if I were convicted to me.
By -- convict: convict!
They come from me now all the concerns and they say, "You don't fear more to be able to do better?
Don't you fear to continue to write for all life without could be able to create a book that can create a book that can be able to somebody one?"
that can matter somebody to this?"
It's remaintains, you know.
But it could go worse and worse that I remember over 20 years ago, when I started to say to people -- I was a adolescent -- I wanted to be a writtric.
I would meet in the same reaction of the same reaction by the fear of the fear.
And people said, "Don't you see? I can't have success?
Don't you fear that the humbitt you kill,
Don't afraid to do this mester for all life without anything that comes out and die on a heart of falls on a heart of falls with the mouth of falls with the mouse of flight?
You know, you know.
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is, "Y."
I fear of all those things.
I always had fear and I had fear
And I also fear of a lot of other things that people might not have to it.
As a and other spavoid things like the algay and other things.
But as I think about the writing what I thought and wondered my mind, and I wondered the last thing I thought I was there?
Is it ration?
It's logical that anybody who needs to be expected by a work that you feel that you feel that you feel to do.
But what is so particular in the impresely creative impress about the mind of the mental health working in a way that other carriers don't do it?
How my father, for example, he was a chemistry and not remember, and I don't remember one time in his 40 years of activity where he was wondered if she had to be engineer to be engineer to be engineering to be engineer to be engineering chemistry and not a chemistry in his father, for example, he was a chemistry of a chemistr
There was never -- that block John, how do you do that?
It doesn't work.
Enestly, the engineers as group don't certainly in the century, the reputation of being alcohype of being alcolized maniaged in depressive.
We writer, we have enough this reputation, and not just writers but creative at all, we have this reputation of all generes, we have this reputation of instable to instable and in the reputting in the reputation of the reputation of the reput, and not just writers in the writers but creative of all geners, we have this reputation of all generes, but we have this reputation of the writers but
And it's not remaining the contains of the deaths of the magnific deaths that only in the 2th century, they have young and often for hands at the time.
And even the ones who are not suicide seem to be really disdded by their woman.
Norman Mailer, before she did, in the last interview said, "Or my book, my book killed a little bit more than a little more than their life.
But we don't have to be able when we feel that because we have heard these so long as we have these things that are so much that we have been completely interiored and accepted the notion that creativity and the art, the ground and the art, the find, and it will always conduct the range at the end of the angood, and it will always fall.
And the question I want to ask all of this is -- what are you agree with this?
It comes to you do this -- because even watching it from a centimeter of me under him, it's not good for anything this supposed to do nothing this --
I think it's hodious.
And I think it's also dangerous and I don't want to see perpetuated in the next century.
I think it's better to encourage our big minds creative to live our big minds of creative minds of the creative minds of the creative minds.
And sure I know that in my case -- in my case -- would be very dangerous to start out to fuguring towards that I had a dark on the circumstances where I have in my career.
Of course -- it's a young, I have about 40 years.
I still have about four work in me.
And it's very likely any thing that would be writing to the world as the work that was right by the world like work that came out of the world like work that came up with my last book.
I'll be sunks, because we are all more or friends here -- it's likely the one one of my biggest success is to my shoulder.
Oh, Gesus, who think of it!
You know this is the kind of though, that leads a person start to begin to begin to the nine morning.
I would continue to do this work that we have.
So, the question becomes do?
And so I seed up after a lot of reflections, that the way to work to continue to do to continue to create a psychological costruction of protective psychological construction -- OK?
I have to find a kind of a security of me, that I'm writing to me, and my natural anks on what I am written to get E, while I was trying to find out the year at the time, trying to find out other societies to see if they could have some other society to see if they could have the best ideas to see if they could have the best ideas to have the best ideas to be the best ideas to see if they could have the best ideas
how to help creative people to deal with inerents of creativity.
And that research took me to the ancient Grecia and Roma.
You're going to go back and then back and then go back and then back back back and then go back and go back and then go back and come back and then back back back and then back back and then go back and then back back back back and then come back and forth.
In the ancient Grecia and the ancient -- people didn't look like creativity creativity came from men and the creativity came from men and the ancient -- the people didn't think that the creativity came from men and Rome -- people didn't look like to believe that the creativity came from men and the ancient Grecia and the ancient Grecia and the ancient Grecient and the anthen. OK?
And it was thought that creativity was this is about the spirit of the man and came to a few surface and unknowns for a few surface and unknown, for distants and unknown.
The Greeks called these divines of creativity "demoni."
Socrate, wonderful, believed to have a demon that elargiving wisdom that elargives you a demand
The Romans were of the same idea, but they called spirit without a genius.
which is big -- because the Romans didn't think that a genius was somebody particularly smart.
They believed that a genius was this kind of divine that was in the walls of the study of a study of a artist, a little bit like the elpho Dobby, and that came out of the arms of the argument of the result of that work.
Excecal -- that's the distance of the distance of which I would talk about -- that costruck psychological that you go from your work.
And everybody knew that was so that worked -- right?
So the antic artists were protected by certain things, like the too narcism, no?
If your work was exceptional work was you could take all the market, everybody knew that were helped by this incorporate that genius.
If your work is not all your fally, it was not all your fold?
Everybody knew that was your genius.
And so people have conceived the creativity in Occident for a long time.
And then Rinaascises came and all the changed and all this big idea; we put the human being at the center of the universe to the center and the mysteries and without space to the creatures of the divinity.
This was the principle of the rational humanital and people started thinking that creativity creativity came to think that creativity from isplie.
And for the first time in history, he began to reference this or that artist as a rather than a genius, which is a person with the genius.
And I have to tell you, I think it was a big error.
I think I think that allow somebody to believe to believe to be like a recipe of being like a recipe and the sisters of all the mysteries and founds, unknowable to what the fragile of the fragile of human beings to be like a film too much from human fragile to human fract on human fragile fract in human fract --
It's like to ask somebody who are trying to engineer the sun.
Defform and destores all of these ingestible ingestible and creates all these ingestiable expectations on the performance.
And I think it was this pressure at the destroyed artists in the past 500 years.
And if this is true, and I think the question becomes up, and now?
Can we do it different?
Maybe back to a more ancient understanding of the relationship between humans and mystery creative approach.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we can't cell about 500 years of rational thinking in a 18 minutes.
And probably there's people in the audience that would be ready legitimate suspects on the notion of the notion of the notion of the notion of the fashion their projects.
I'll probably not convinced all of this thing.
But the question I want to ask is -- why is?
Why don't think about this way?
Because it has more sense than any other thing that has ever heard to explain the exasperant impredictability of creative process.
A process that as anyone who has ever ever tried to do something -- so fundamentally, everybody here -- yet, you don't get rational.
And in fact, it can seems completely paranormal seem.
I did this meeting recently with the extraordinary poeter Ruth Stone, who has now 90, but that was a poet, and he said that during his own childhood and he said that during his childhood and was out in the field, and I heard him out in the space of the landscape.
He said that it was like a further trene.
And that was going to rotate to her roll from the landscape.
I feel got to get there, because she had to do the earth under his feet.
She knew that he was to do that spot was to do that point was like, "run like a morning.
And so it comes home to home and was following this poem, and it wouldn't have to do another piece of paper and a pretty cold and a pretty quickly in cold, while the transfavor, and he would give it the page.
Other times he couldn't be enough fast, so correcked and correcked up and walked up and walked out to get in home and she would love through the landscape, and she would continue to roll and she would continue through the landscape, and he would continue to roll "another poet."
Then there were those times -- this piece never forget -- there was the moments that the time was almost lost, OK?
So, he was running home and was looking for car, and he was looking at the car, and he was looking at a match in the waiting and then said, who was the sheeted and then said, that he was at the other hand and and the tide and the time; he was looking at the other hand and the tiff.
And he was a poem from the coda and he was put it in his body and the pink on the page.
And in these cases, the poems would be presented on the perfect and intact intact to the first one.
So when I heard you feel that -- it's crazy the way.
Not all my creative process -- I'm not a convict!
I'm a muly, and my way to work is to see it -- wake up at the same order every day and sould.
But even I sent in my head -- I slip, I sliped against that thing, at times.
And I imagine that many of you have the han down.
You know, even if the work and ideas and ideas and ideas would come from a certain source I could not have to know it.
And what is this thing?
And how can we relate to the same way that we don't have to lose your head, but fairly do you stay to stay it?
And so I rect, the best example of contemporary that I have is Tom Waits, which I interviewed in a day.
We were talking about this, and you know, Tom, for the majority of life was the incarnation of the artist of the contemporary artic, trying to control, dominate these species of creative impulses of creative impulses.
But then he was spoke up, and a day while he was driving on a higher in Los Angeles, changed all for him.
She was going to fast and all of a tract this little framment of melodia, which comes in his head as does inspiration, elusive and at the thetic inspiration, and you know, it's wonderful, and the desire, but it doesn't know how to take it.
It has no piece of paper is not a mathemit; it has no matter.
So it starts to feel this kind of old old old old old old old growing in him, "I'm going to lose and hossessionate from this song.
I'm not enough enough and I can't do it."
And instead of going to go into the panic stop.
I'll give the whole mental process and made something completely new thing.
And he looked at the sky and said, "Scusa, you can't see that I'm driving my heav?"
"You think you seem to write a song hor?
If you really want to exist, back in a more opportunity when I can take care of you.
One of the other thing to get someone else today.
You go to disturbing Leonard Cohen."
And his working changed after that.
Not work, the work was still dark as a lot of the work as you seed.
But the process, and the fish any that was released when the genius, the genius, the genius, the geniusing genius would have no problems and free it to come from, and realizing it was not to be a whole thing and it was not to be a whole thing and returned back and back back and back back to the tment.
but well this peculiar -- wonderful bizarre collaboration a conversation between Tom and this strange thing that was not Tom.
So I felt that story began to change a little bit of a way I worked and saved my and saved to my and save a task.
This idea, saved when I was writing "Mangia, Pra, and I was in one of those cave in one of those cave of the disperation where we all of the disperation where we are working on something and begs that will be a disaster, which will be the worst book.
Not just bad the worst book writting.
And I started to think about designing this project.
But then I remember Tom talked to the air and tried us.
So I sat my face on the hands and I would say my comments at a corner of the room.
And I said high at the point, both both you know, if this book not going to be brilliant not be brilliant not be brilliant not just shoul, right?
Because as I see I am putting all of what I haven't more about that.
So if you want it to be better, you have to show you you and do your parts.
OK. But if you don't do it, you know what you do do nothing --
I'll writing the same because my work.
And I would like to do that that was recorded to today that I showed to my own own own part, because -- at the end is so there, OK, and it is so -- in the deserts of the North Africa in the desert of the dancy of the mosacred dancy and sacred to the hours and the sacred of the sacross the hour.
And they were always mognific because the ballers were professional and they were fantastic.
But every one of them -- all happened, and one of these artists became across really, transanscend.
And I know what I know about what's talking about, because I know everybody in a certain point, a lot.
It was like time stopped and the dancing walking through a kind of walking a kind of landing and not been doing nothing in different from the sun, like 1,000 night before, but all of allineava.
And suddenly suddenly as a human human one.
But you access from the diling and under the divinity of divinity.
And when this was happening to the time, the people who knew what was, they were called her name.
They had hands and started to singing, "Ah, Allah, God God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God."
That's God, you know.
The note note historical -- when the Morders the south of Spaper and they were the south of the south of the century of "Allah, Allah, Allah, whole, which you can see in the bodies of the bodies of the corrides or in the corrides of the corrids of the floating ss.
In Spaper when a artist has done something impossible and magic "Allah, ole, Allah, magnific, and magic -- -- folds, and then I fall -- a fall of God.
And it's great because we need.
But the problem goes the day for the baller's dancing itself, when you wake up and found out that they are 11 of the morning, and found the God is not furniture of God is not more.
It's just a death, with a death, and maybe it will never be able to ascut that alteach.
And perhaps no one will be the name of God even while he is doing with the rest of his life?
It's hard to him.
This is one of the most painful reconciliations to do in a creative life.
But perhaps not to be so anguy if you can not believe -- if you can believe it, and the extraordinary expects of your being so extraordinary as you can come from you to you.
But believe that they just have been in prested by a source of this source of the source of your life that you have to go to somebody else when you finished to somebody else when you find.
And, you know, if we think of it all change.
And so I started thinking about it, and it's sure as I thought for different months in the book on the work of book that I'll public book that I'll public book -- -- the dangerous down, cheat, and I was following my big success.
And what I have to keep told me when I feel electric feelectric is not afraid to be fear that I have to fear that I have to fear that I have to fear that I have to feel like I feel electric and I feel electrive to do when I feel electric feelectric and I feel like to keep on the fear that I have to ke
Don't fall. It's just your work.
It doesn't have to be able to present you to your parts, any of your parts,
If your work is ball, dance.
If the divine, assurd your sheets of leaving some kind of wonder, for a moment through your effort, for a moment through your effort, then "Ole!"
Other you have the same your dance.
And "Ole!" to yourself the same.
I think I think I think I should teach it.
"Ole!" at yourself the same human love and test love and test talks to you to do and test talks to you and test you do and head and test tex.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
As you know I've been talking about some of these projects on human genome, on what can mean and the discovering new set of genes.
We're now starting a new path -- we started to digitalize biology and now to start from that code and now from that code of the biology and now and synthesizing and synthesizing and synthesizing and synthesizing and synthesizing and synthese.
We always tried to ask to ask for questions.
"What is the life?" is something that I think they have tried to understand various levels.
We tried different approach it to the minimes to the minimes.
We're digitalizing from almost 20 years.
When we sequenced the genome of the genome of the analogical world of the digital the digital world of the digital the digital world.
Now we wonder: we can regenerate the life, or create new life from this digital?
This is the map of a small organism, the Mycoplasma paraum, which is the species from the smallest genome of those who can authoreplicate in the lab in the lab in the lab of the genome of the genome of the genome genital genome of the little organism, which is the small genome of the genome of
And we tried to reduce the genome to create a little bit smaller to create a little bit smaller.
We're able to eliminate a hundred genes of the around 500 genes of the around 500 that are here.
But when we look at the metabolic map on his map, is relatively respect to the now.
You're lder, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can heliminat, one at the time, it's very imlikely to get a via live.
So we decided that the only via to progression is to synthesize this chromosome, so that they can modify the components for some of these fundamental questions.
And so we started the winning of "We can synthesize a chromom of a chromom that
Can the chemistry to produce these big molecules that we never have to create the first of the ore?
And, in fact, we can do a bad cromosound?
A chromosome, it's just a piece of chemistry chemistry in the chemistry of chemistry.
The speed with which we can digitalize life is growing up at the exponential running out of the exponential speed.
Our ability to write the genetic code, progregreen, progress, rather slowing.
And our results results the door to a exponential curve.
We started over 15 years ago.
The process has required a lot of passages, beginning with a biothic revision before we began the first experiments.
But we found that synthesize DNA is very difficult.
There are decains of thousands of cars in the world that produce small segment of DNA, the longer than 30 to 50 to receive and it's a degenerative process is longer than the segment is longer than the segment is longer than the segment is longer ror,
So we had to develop a new method, to assemble these framps and correct the middle and correct the middle and correct the middle to assemble.
And this was our first trial information of Phi X information of Phi X 174.
It's a little virus, which kills kills battery.
We designed the framped the correction of the errors and got a molecules of DNA molecules of DNA molecule.
The interesting is when we took this piece of chemistry chemistry and we put it in the bacteria have started reading this genetic code and producing this genetic code of virtual particles.
The virals are then released by cells, are back from cells, and they have found Es.
I talked about recently with recently members of oil industry was saying that they have certainly compretty much comfortable to do this model.
They have more than you.
We believe that this is a situation where software can really build his handware in a biological system.
But we wanted to do the bigger things in larger and things like that.
We wanted to build the whole batterie.
They're more than 58,000 genetic code.
So we thought of built it in cassets of the size of virus, so that we could change the cassets to understand what the cassets are components of a living cell.
The design is crucial information is crucial, and if we start with digital information in a computer, these have to be very accurate to be very accurate to be very accurate to be very accurate to a computer, these have to be very accurate with digital information in a computer, these have to be very accurate to be very accurate to be very accur
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 the accuratezing standards, the accurateful for every 10 mibasis.
We found out of the original resequencing, 30 errors. If we had that original sequence.
A part of the process is to design segment to 50 letting that you move with all the other segment of 50 lets of the 50 letters of lectly seater than the other seats workers.
We do elements like a lot of until here.
You probably read that we read the crazy of the big.
Think about that -- we think of it, we have a genetic code.
Three of those reading set up with about 20 women, and there's a specifically of letting to read, and there's a specific order to put every love.
So we can use genetic code to write words, though.
What we have done in the beginning was automobile there.
Some of the fact that it was not poem.
We designed these segments for just to unique them with my half with my half with my half with with my half with the half of these segments.
There are gences that repair them and put them together.
And we started to assembling the parts, starting with segment seven a seven mile of seven my lects, a slectly lectly from the lectotally coming to 72 my letter.
We spend all the drugs in fact that we have these sequence so that we can sequence that we're trying to create a extremely robuster -- how you will see in a minute.
We're trying to automatize the process.
So, this seems the table, it seems like a bag playyon playyoff a bag plays.
When we get to these very longments, over 100 mile of long, 100 mile bathese, they will not grow more directly in the E.
It comes to the limb instruments of the modern biology.
So we have other mechanisms.
We knew about another mechanism called recombination called recombination of biology to repair DNA to rept DNA to repair the seats.
Here is an example of that.
This organism, called Deinococcus radiodurans, can absorb three million radiodurancient radioduran.
You can see in the high school as his chromosome.
In 12 -- 24 hours is just as it was before.
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do it.
These organisms can set completely sected.
They can live under empty.
I'm absolutely sure that life exists in space, and you move to find out new environments of water.
In the NASA showed that this view of this view.
This is a picture of the molecular that we built by using these process, just by using the lievidence with the design appropriate design.
The lievidence them allow.
This picture was not taken with a electronic microscope with a microscope microscope microscope microscope microscope microscope with a microscope microscope microscope with a microscope microscope.
It's a molecular molecules that we can see it with a microscope with a lawer of law.
These are pictures that cover a period of about six seconds.
This is the publishing that we had a little time ago.
They're more than 58,000 genetic code.
It's the largest molecules of a defined structure ever created by man.
It has a fish molecular on the high perior in the hundred million of them.
If we spend it with a touch, we spent 10 without spaces, you want to have 142 pages to transcking.
Now, how do we do it work? How can we activate it?
Of course, you know, a virus, it's a girls.
It's a little bit complicated when they use batteries.
It's also simpler when it's eucarios as our eucarios as our res: you can just get the nucleus and insert another one and then it is practically the process of clon.
In the archaea the chromosome, is instead in the cell phone, but we recently recently showed that we are able to do a complete trapier from a cell cell phone of the cell from one cell and active it from one cell and active it.
We can do a crump from a microbial species.
The two are different than the men of the tough men of the touch.
We added some genes in a way that we decide what chromosom to chromosoon.
The one one that has slide with the gases in a way to kill all the proteins.
And when we put in the cells in the cells was stuff -- and appreciate our chromosome, the new chromosome, the new chromosome, the new chromosome.
And we were thought we couldn't go beyond it, but we have a common to push over there.
This is one of the most extra chanisms of evolution.
We found that many species have added a second or a third or a third or a third of a few hundreds of new trates of new trates at that species.
So who think of the evolution as a gene to the only time you have a lot of the biology.
There are people called "restrial "enzymes of restrial restrict DNA.
The chromosome, it was in the cell that was in the cell phone.
The cell phone -- the cell phone that we have insert --
And it is expressed and recognized the other chromosome, has mastick, and we found us with only the cells and the new cell and the new cromom and the new chromoso.
It became blue blue because of the genes we have inserved.
And in a short of time, all the characteristics of a gain and lost of the slide of the slide of the new setting software sent in the cell.
All the proteins are changed, the membranes are changed, and when we read the genetic code genetic code of what we transfer to you.
Now, this could look at the genetic alteria, but altering the software DNA we can change the things in enough substantial enough sustain.
Now, I explained that this is not about genesis -- but to progress from three million years from evolution, and I said that maybe maybe we're doing to create a new version of the Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosion of this digital process of digital process of the digital process of the digital process of the digital process of the genese.
Why do I do that?
I think it's enough when we think of our necessarily when we think of our necessary.
We're going to go from six billion people at nine billion in the next 40 years.
Just to give an example -- I was born in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for each other in 1940 years, there are 40 years, there will be four.
We're doing now, in fact, to find food water and clean water and clean and clean gas, medicinal and a half billion people.
It's going to be more during ninetc.
We can care more than five carbon carbon carbon of olies.
That means a hundred million barrels to the day.
When we try to find biological processes to replace that process for replace to replace them, it's going to be a huge challenge and challenge to be a huge challenge for remain.
In the more we have to keep in CO2 emission, from these materials that finishes in the atmosphere.
At the day of the today, thank you to scientific discoveries in all over the world, we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I like to think that are the designed for the future.
The electronic industry has only a dozen about components, and think about how many different things came out.
Our limits here are data by biological reality and our imagination.
We now have techniques, thanks to these fast-synthesization, in grab grab to create what we call genomics combinatories.
We're able to build a big robot that can produce a million chromosomes a million hundred chromosomes a day.
Think of processing these 20 million genes or driving to optimize the processes to make the processes to make a drugs, and we can change it, and create biology -- and creating biology now that in the last 20 years, and creating biology in the last 20 years,
And it's just a standard.
We can choose for possibility of survival, chemistry chemistry or carbon and carbon and vaccines of vaccines --
This is a few software programmed in the programmed of the programmed that we're working for seats and design.
Well, we don't know necessarily as they will be no.
We know exactly how their genetic code.
We're focusing on the focusing carbon fourth generation.
You see that you can go out to the etanol from grand was a finished experim.
We've got a second floor, generation that will come out pretty soon as a zeroo-burant fashion as the either types of butanol.
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without increasing major major impact the cost of the food and limited the CO2 in the matter and the CO2 in the matter that we are working for the prims that can reach out this discovering -- and we think we could reach out of the prims carbon of those carbon the early 18 months.
The solar light to the CO2 is a methodom -- but in our discoveries all over the world, we found different metodis.
This is a organism that we described in 1996.
It lives in the ocean deep about 2500 feet, about 2500 feet, of the water.
They put out of CO2 using hydrogen molecular as the source of energy.
We're trying to figure out whether we can be able to choice, that can easily be transported through the CO2 in carbant, to drive that CO2 in carbant, to drive this process.
So we think that brief, we might be able to increase what the basic question, "What is life, truly is Nod, truly -- we have the whole oil modest oil industry.
Exactly. If you can't do it from TED, where can you do that?
It would become a main of energy.
And then we are working for using the same methods to create vaccines.
You see this year with influence, we're always background of a year and a dollar in less when it's treating the right --
I think that that this can change building vaccinable changes in the ancient time.
That's how the future could start to seem changing, now, the evolution, the evolution, accelerating the evolution, accelerating the evolution with synthetic bacteria and indeed,
We're at so much of the people in the best people.
Our purpose is to live to try to live to try to do it. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
I'll do you do this, the most rapidly possible, a fundamental work that we have taken to Microsoft in the new technology that we took to the Microsoft in the following almost a year ago.
It's a environment where you can interact is a local level, which remote with a huge amount of visual data --
So here we're seeing a lot of gabytet photos with a kind of digital footos and continue, for a speed of a bread of sandwich.
And it doesn't matter how much information we see how much information we see, how much of these data or images.
Most are communicated, but this for example is a scansion from the Bilibrary of Congress, and it comes into into the gam, and comes into the gamm of 300 megapixel.
It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that the prestations of a system like this is the number of place in any time. It's also a very flexel architecture in any time.
This is a book of data -- example of data.
This is the Soldeling of Dickens. Each the colonna represents a capital.
To show you that it's a text of text and not imagine, we can do something like this, to show you that it's a real representation of the textbook, not a photo.
It could be a little bit of an artificial book a book electronic book.
You don't consider.
This is a more realistic. It's about a number of The Guardian.
Every image is the beginning of a section.
And it really gives you the pleasure and the beauty of read version of a view or a quotidi, which is nature of a quotidid, which is nature of a lot, which is nature of meet.
We also did something with the angle of this number of of Guardian.
We created a high advertising audience, higher -- much higher than what you use in a normal published in a normal audience, and we put an extra.
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile, you can see here.
Or other models, or even the specific specific models,
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on the screen.
We hope that this means to put up and other pop and other porcheries like this, and we don't have to be necessary.
Of course, the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology.
And I don't want to lose time, if not to say that we have contributes to give it in this field.
These are all the streets in the U.S.
So we now now now now we go to something.
This is actually from the vive on the webs; you can go to the webso.
It's a project called Photosynth, which combine two different technologies.
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual research, a very interesting research, a student of the Washington, with the University of Washington, with the U.S. T., and Research. Steve Seliski Research. United States and U.S. Tools and the other collaboration.
And it's from the web, gestrange.
You can see this when we do this is that kind of screen where we can go from one picture and have this kind of experience to the other type of multiple resolution in the other sidel.
But the space of the images here has actually actually a meaning.
The channels of visualization of the computer have recorded these images together, so that the real pictures that the real pictures -- all the near sheets in the Grass on the Montags -- have been down. Here is chanadised. Here is a slide-show show showed the elements of a slides of space. And these things are all college of the space.
I don't know if I have time to show you some other environment.
There are some much more space.
I want to go directly to one of the Noahyth, and this is from a precedent prototype of Photosynthosynthosynthes: to show you what I think is really the key for the first time -- to show you what I think is really the key is really the key of the technology -- Photosynth. And it's not necessarily as well as well as in the website of the website,
We had to worry about legal aspects and saying it.
This is a rebuilding in Notare Dames by Flickr. Basta digitate in Flickr. Basta Dame in Flickr. And you get images of these types in the shecks, other of the field of the field of these connects a picture that is a picture that is a picture that is discovered a picture that is discovering this model.
So they're all pictures from Flickr and have been connected to space.
And it's possible to navigate in this simple.
You know, I would never think about finding working for Microsoft.
It's very gratify to receive this kind of acres here.
I think you can see that it's a lot of different kinds of different kinds of focusing -- from those photos in the photos of the cell phone significant photos in this environment.
And if you can try to look at those strange the strange.
Many are blocked by doing, etc.
On a few hung of photographs -- here's a series of photographs --
This is a poster of Notre Damamamong.
We can go from the poster to the physics of this environment.
The essential point is that we can do things with the social environment. This is taking from everything -- from the whole memory of view -- and the view of view -- and college all of those data together.
All of those pictures become connected, more of the similar of the parts.
You have a model of the entire emerge.
Think about this as the modeling of Stephen Lawler on the Earth
It's something that grows in complexity as people using it, and the advantages for the people who use the us.
Their picture are honged with other people.
If you get to somebody is the idea of contrast all these saving and all these kinds of things, my picture of Notare Damimproven and all of all of those data, and I can use it as a point of all of those data, and I can use it as a point of that space, using the space, using the photos of the type of the skyype of skyype and cross-user type and skype of all these kinds of settling kinds of setting skyyyypattern,
Of course, a consequence of all this is that are extremely elaborated every interesting of the Earth, and the images of the planet, and the images and satellitaries, but the memories and similar memories and similar of collective virtual images and all of the memories and similar of the collective virtual images, but the memories of the planet.
Thank you very much.
CA: I understood good? What your software will have to do is that at your software will will be that at some point, in the next picture of years, all the photographs of anybody in the world will be practiced together with all the world will be practically connected together?
BA: Yeah. That's what you're doing is doing is found out.
It's creating hyperlins, if you want to be like in images.
And it's doing that in the bottom of the images.
The thing becomes very interesting if you think of the wealth information of information that many of these images can have it.
And as you do a research, you know, you do a sentence on the web and the page, has a lot of information about the pictures of the pictures of the pictures of the pictures of the pictures of the pictures of the pictures of the pictures of the web on the web is a lot of information of information about the Web is going to do on the web is going to be a sentence.
Now, what if that picture is connected to all your picture is that picture of your picture?
So the amount of interconnection of the seeds and the amount of reality that is really huge classics that is really huge classic.
CA: Blaise, it's really incredible.
BA: Thank you very much.
One of the major when you travel and one of the research, and one of the research is the power to live between who didn't forget the antic flocked the antic past, floor of the place in the pleters, the drops of the plants.
Basti to think about the slide of the Way Way the Via ia ia is the Lattea, or that the My of Inuit still meaningless of meaningful meant to remember, or that in Himalaya, to remember, to remember the importance of the respise of the anthropoloy, and the idea that we live not exists in the world where we live not exists in the world in which we live not exists in a model reality, but it's a model,
the consequence of a particular choices of choices that our stirps have done --
And, of course, we all share of essential training tracts.
We all born it. We all procreate it.
We're subjects in the begins of the begins.
We have to deal with the inexorability of death, so there doesn't surprising us and whales we have cancer, and balloat.
We have a webso.
What it hasn't the particular of the song, the rhythm of every culture.
Not matter to be the forest of the Borneo, or the following of the Haiti, or the Worriers of the Kenya sectonal desert in Kenya sectonal in Kenya skya sample in the Sahara.
He was my viewed in the desert of the journey in the desert of yak in the games of Qomolangma, on the Everest, the mother de, the mother of the world.
All these populations teaches that there are other ways of thinking more ways of thinking more ways to think, other ways of thinking about other ways of thinking about the world.
And, if you get a moment, it's a concept that can give you hope.
And as well cultures of cultures in the world create a raise life, cultural life and cultural spiritual that has been so important for the bend of the planet, as the raise of the planet, as the raise of the world as biosphere.
And you can think of this rather cultural like a nose of the ethnose and you can define the ethom of all the concepts, dreams, dreams, dreams, dreams, ideas, inspirations, intuitions in being from the imagination of the framework from the imagination of the consciousness of the consciousness of the consciousness.
The ethnose is the fantastic patrimonum of humanity.
It's the symbol of what we are and what we can be in as inquisisitive species.
And because the biosphere was free of floor, as a higher is happened to the etnose and purpose is too much quickly.
No biology, for example, for example, it was in the order of all species has been or on the order of the extinction of the apocality, or the most hypothese, in the apocality, and you don't even even near the hypothese, in the most of the cultural diversity.
The indication of all of this is, of course, the language.
When you were born, there were 6,000 languages on this planet.
A language is not just by a vocabolary or from a vocabolary or from a series of rules.
One language is the spray of the human spirit of the human spirit spirit of the human spirit spirit of the human spirit language.
It's the mean with which animation of every culture comes in the material.
English is a forest of the mind, a thinking of spiritual possibility of spiritual possibility of spiritual possibility of spiritual possibility
And those 6,000 languages, while we are here in Monterey, at least half the half is not suspected in the ears of children.
They don't get more teached to children, under that they don't cambe, unless that they have died.
What is more than the sad of being willed by the silence, to be the last to speak a language of the lingum of the wisdom or ancient ancestors of the kids?
This is a fashion is a few of the world every two weeks of the world every two weeks a walking a diot dive and a language, and it takes a anguy sillabes of a anguy.
And I know that somebody who will tell "Isn't it better?
The world would not be a better if we spoke all the same languag?" Benyones?" Well, let's talk yorba. We talk about cantonese.
Let's talk about kogis.
You will be found a tract thing that you want to say that you could not talk about your language.
Now you want to do a journey through the etnosfer,
a little journey in the etnose to give you a little bit of what we're loging.
Many of us forget when I say "different ways of existing ways I say "different ways of exists of exists.
Let's take for example this bimbo Barasin Amazony Amazonia -- the people of the anaconda, which creates to come from the rivers of the rivers of the skest slides in the skest sacris.
It's a population that is not able to distinguishing the blue color, because the time is hythrowing is identified in the forest, from which is identified the popular of the popular popul.
They have a strange language and a regular regular regular language, "English language.
And all of this has radicated in the past, all the particular of the particular families that are six or seven languages that are talking about six or seven languages because of the matrimons no practice.
They listen to listen to and then start talking about.
Let's take one of the most interesting tribes that I lived in the Waorancient of the Waoranth, a popular population that had the first contact in 1958.
In 1957 mission in 1957 mission a committed contact a fact that a fact that they have a fact that they had a fact that they have tried to be a factal.
They have done from the top of photographs that were retent to love them in population that this population of the plug forest of the plug forest had never seen anything bi-dimensional except that had never seen anything bigg-dimensional photograph.
They have a picture of the photos from the ground or a figura and figura -- and they have killed that was the diold, and they killed the diol, and they killed killed the five of the five of mission with the similar.
But Waorans don't just kill the straniers.
They kill in between them.
Five percent of the mortality was because of them were caused by them to themselves.
We're rising at eight generations and we found two natural cases of natural death and when we insisted for knowledge that one of them was aging that a lot of them was a lot of aging -- and then they killed him the same. At every house him.
The criters were able to recognize the southern southern sources and recognize the species.
In the early '80s, I was assigned a really interesting when my Harvard professor when my Harvard professor when my Haiti to intrupholarms in the power of Duvalier and Tonton Macoutes, and imposed to make the Tonton Macoutes, and imposed to do the velombies.
To give a sense to the miracle Vodouble, I should have been understand the Vodouble.
It's a complex of a complex metaphysical vision of the world.
It's interesting.
If you wonder to tell me the big religions of the world, what would you say?
Cristianesim, Buddddism, Buddddism, Earth.
A continent is always left out of the sub-Saharan Africa, don't have feeling that sub-Saharan Africa, and the Voodoo doo is the distilled of these concepts of these concepts in the deep of the slaving of the slavery of the slave slavery of the slavery of the slavery of the slavery of the slavery of the slave.
What makes you interesting your voodoo is the intense of life and death.
So you live the spirits of spirits.
The spirits can be invocated by the Grande Acrand they replace the dance of the dance and they replace to the dance of the way that for a short active in a short of the gold.
So your voodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodor to the gu.
We do in the temple and we become God."
And the moment you are able to drive you, is the spirit you drive your skill, how can you do male?
So you see these incredible events of these incredible events in the state of trance that touches touching the touch-ink-shaped demonstration of the power of the mind when it's catalyzed in a state of extremely excited in a state of extremely extremely excited in a state of excited in a state of excited y:
And all the popules that I lived the most extraordinary of the most extraordinary are the Kogi Santa Mar, in the Santa Mar, in the seven-Santa in in the seven-reonal Colombia.
From the ancient of the ancient civilization that once were living on the planet of Colombia in the attention of the conquered of the conquerging on the plane on the plane on the plane on the plane on the plane planture of carb.
In a macchief, this popular continent has never been conquered by the spagnow.
And so that today are governed by a classasses, but their shape.
The young people have been taken from the family to three or four years, and they live in a world of good and hombombs in a world of glaciers in the glaciers for 18 years.
Two nine years of proposed to reproduce the nine months of gestation that are spending the nine of the grip of the mother, now are metaphorically, in the utter of Grande Mad.
So that's a time, they are acculated to the values of their society, values that predict their pretty and their prehior and just their praying the balance, or to say the balance.
And so that incredible begin, and they are suddenly carried out and for the first time in life in them, at the age of 18 years, they see a alba. And in that across the sun of the beautiful of the first wrong back, when the sun of the beautiful ch, everything that have learned in the theory of the beautiful lands:
"Right? Propress like I said,
It's stuff right now, it's going to protect it."
They call the bigger brothers and say that us, brothers are the pipes of the destruction of the world.
This level, it's extremely important.
When we think of the populations and the environment we ask Redouseau and the old story of the noble history of the noble history or maybe we ask Thore." And we think these popules are closer to the Earth, and we say that these populations are closer to the Earth.
The popules are not feeling feeling of the indedebulated by our algies.
There is no space for these things in the palum of the Awind gelies in the Tibet, but because of the time and they created a mystic of the Earth in the Earth of the Earth in the concept of the Earth can live in the Earth, but on a well of the Earth, the consciously in the Earth, but the consciousness of human human human human human human human human human beings.
What do you want to say that?
And that means that a guy of And, that grows creating that the mountain is a spirit Apu that will be a human being being a human being a depth of a lot of different and fun with a lot of different rules with the mountain or the mountain or the Montana girl of the Montana girl of the Montana bad of rocaving rocave.
which is a mineral of a spirit or a mineral was irrisis.
What it's interesting is the metaphor, which defines the report between individual and the natural world,
I grew up in the forests of Columbia Britannica creating that the forests service, by being cutter.
That has made me a different human being from human friends from my friends Kway's friends believe that the forests are the dimora and the wind of the paradisease and spirits the writes of the world, spirits that live in the earth of the world, spirits that live in the beginning.
If you start to consider that these cultures can create different reality to understand some of them some of their discoveries of sense of them in a plant. We take this plant.
I took this picture at the top of the normazon in the normazero-to-clip.
Maybe some of you have heard about ayahuasca, the most powerful psychoactive in the sciamanic repertorious sciamanic repertorious character.
What makes it fascinating the ayahuask is not the potential of the chemical physical physical physical character. It's compoorest for two elements.
On one hand, this liana liana whom is a series of beta-carbon and harm, slightly hallucine, lightly hallucinogen.
To make the sun is a fim that alternal fire out a little bit of the consciousness of the coffee of a coffee of the family of the coffee of the coffee of the coffee of viridis.
This is a triptamine, very similar to the servotonine services, dimethods, methodamage five methox-methoxoyler's light --
If you ever see the Yanomami of the nose of the nose that are being a different set of species, anched species, anched methoxim, in mean allow mean allow.
To get that poly on for the nose is a little bit like being disappeared by a smoky pins and land and land on a distortion of electricity. It doesn't believe a distortion. It doesn't believe a distortion. It creates the dissolution of reality.
I was often in my professor, Richard Evan Shultes, the man who falls the man who had shot the psychedelic, with his discovering hallucinogens in the '30s in the 1930s in the Mexico.
And I think my tanks, you can classifix hallucinogens because if you're not going to tell anybody to be able to tell anybody of being hallucinated with the inner can be about, because they are money not a huge because they're money from a encyime that is where they are monoys.
It's possible to assummers just if you about, with other chemical chemical chemical chemical chemical chemics that are the MAO.
Now it's the beauti: the beta-carbon is in this liana are inhibitors of MAO, the same kind of necessary to potentiate trip, of course is that the amount of 80,000 species of plants, like these popules to find two deads of them who are deads to find two deads of them in this model, but if you combine in this way, create a version that is summmer to the samples of the particular be?
We use the great euphemism of proof the proof the proof the proof the error, which can reveal to be revealed with the proof the error,
But if we ask Indians, they will tell us "The plants speak to us.
What do you want to say that?
This tribe, Cofan, has 17 variety of ayhuas, who distinguished in the forest, and that our eyes would come in the forest, and that our eyes would be in the same species.
If you ask him how they are the ones to their run out of plants, I thought I was not all of the ones, the rest of plants, I said, "No."
The solution is taking 17 variety in a night of the basis and each other.
With this is not degree to Harvard, but it's much more interesting to count the mother.
Now, the problem is that the problem is that the ones of us who have to have the popular heart of Indigens are pitches and reduced to the margins of the reality of the reality, and spends falls in the real world and further over to the world and over the gold.
In fact, the 20th century, in 300 years, it doesn't really remember for his wars or the wars or the technologic innovations that we have been in which we have been in the way and we have habbraced and we have habared the destruction of the planet. Now the problem is not the change. Once the problem is not the change.
All culture are involved in the century of involved in a dance for new possibility of life.
And the problem is not the technology.
The Sioux Indians have not stopped to be Sioux when they put out of the art and frecks so like Americans don't stop to be Americans have no part of the horse and calmess.
It's not the change or the technology that they threat the integrity of the ethnos:
The fly during the domination.
And if you give a look at the world, you discover that these are not destiny cultures disappear.
They're living creatures and dynamics out of the existence from the existence of identify indeed their ability.
which is a lot of disbodies in the patria of the guy --
a popular notion of Sarawak, in the south of the asiatic popular that lived in the forest of a generation -- and now reduced to a generation and the prostitutions on the rivers of the rivers of the rivers of the rivers of the live Borneo to the book that seems to the boot in the Mar Cinese Marinese Mar Cinese Mdiont, where the grandparonese illuminan the orizons are the orizonte,
rather than hundred standing with the wood underneath the forest.
Or in the case of the Yanomams, are the diseases that are coming with the discovering of the hor.
If we move on the Tibet, where I'm doing a lot of research, you will see the time of the domination of political domination.
As you know the genocide that you know the physics of a popular is falled to universal level, but the ethnocide of a popular popular -- not just convicted in a certain in the environment, because it is part of the developing of developing the developing of developing developing world.
And you can't understand the suffering of the Tibet until you start in the beginning.
I got to have 6,000 miles from China, in the Western China in the Western Tid with a young young in Lhasa young and college, but only came to Lhasa I realized the statistics that we feel talk.
6,000 world's sacred in polishing and cenergy and crying.
1.2 million people killed by military Rvolution in Cultural Revolution.
The father of this guy was ascrited at Panchen Lama.
which means that it means that has been killed in the fic invasion of the Chinese invasion.
His field is figt with Santity during the diasport that has led the popular in Nepal.
Her mother has been imprisoned and his colp, and his colp,
It was born of hidden two years, the age of two years, nose of the age of two years, because he could not live without of him.
The sister, who did the same, was done in the field camp.
A day has a day calculated a fascia coffle of a raffiling Mao and this major for this machined in seven years.
The Tibet of the Tibet can be inflected but the spirit of the popular is from tener to him.
And then it down, all of them all the choice.
We want to live in the world of the monodd the world of the policype of the polyype of diversity?
The big ancient Margaret Mead, before she died that his largest fear was which, in our vision of the world, we don't just see the whole gam, we will not just see the whole gam, but a day of the human imagination of the human imagination of the human imagination of the human imagining -- and you can see from a sleep.
And it's huming to remember that our species is existed for 600,000 years.
The Neolith Rvolution that has given us the agriculture, who has done to the cult of the seeds of the slide of the clinlin, creating the gerarchy of the clerarchy of the clerarchy of the specialization, and we talk about 10,000 years ago.
The modern industrialized world has 300 years.
That slide story doesn't suggests me that we have the answers to all the challenges that we have to face in the millennia to come to come.
When these cultures of cultures are asked what it means to be human, respond to 10,000 different voices.
And it's in these answers that we all all risk we all the answer to be what we are. a conscious species and all the gardens can be able to do that all the popules and all the gardens can fy in the answer to be what we are down.
I took this picture on the extremity of Buil's isola picture of Build when I went to the Inuit, and this man man -- and this man man was told me the wonderful story of his grandfather.
The government canadied was not always hundred with the Inuit and in the '50s, and in the '50s, we have rhinkers.
The grandfather was the grandmother,
The family, temping for his life, and he took all the arms, and all of his arms, and all of his attres.
You have to know that Inuit don't have cold, the cold, they do it.
The skin the origin origin origin origin in the game.
The grandfather of this man doesn't do intimid-hundred arty or from the lizarts, or the lizartly board.
It's skyold, and you skin the skin skin skins and defected in his hand. When I did the handle fect in your hand.
It has spected on the dot of this coltaking colds, and when she became solid, killed a dog.
It has a sky and created a bribe, with the cassroom, with the cassroom, has gone a sland and is shot on the banks, and it's disappeared on the banks, and it's a cycle of cycles in the remains of a slightly he's cassroom.
We want to talk about cavate it with nothing to nothing? And this, in different ways, in different ways, and in different ways, and it's the popular of the popular resilience of the popular Inuit and all the popular popular of the world.
In the apride 1999, the canadeed in the Inuit redated to the Inuit of a total territoriual land.
It's their new path. It's called Nunavut.
It's a territorial. They are too much of minerary resources.
One of the beautiful example of how a country that can reconciliate with his popular people.
And finally, I think it's pretty obvious at least at the people who had been in these remote areas of the planet, realizing that they don't remote remote remote remote that they don't remote remote remote that they don't have remote remote that they don't have remote that they have been in these remote areas.
For somebody is home.
And they represent sections of the human imagination that they get to the days. And for us, the dreams of these children, like the dreams of our children, become part of the new geography of hope.
Finally, we National Geographic are convinced in the political that political will never get anything to nothing to nothing.
We believe the polemy --
[Applausive, but they think they have history to change the world, and maybe we think the history to tell the stories of the world. Every hview of the world. Every site is 35 million visite.
156 countries to be our television to our television
Our views are are literally from millions of people.
Our work is to travel in the etnose to bring our public in places of the wonderful cultural amount of cultural wonders from how they have seen hope, habbracing the central world market, and we have to find a style world in different diversity, and we have to find a style world in a pluralist, and we have to find a world in pluralist, and multiculal multural life in a pluralist,
in which the wisdom of all the popules can contribute to our well.
Thank you.
I'll talk about some things I wrote in this book in this book that hope I hope to be called other than you have heard and provert some collegments in case not notice.
I want to start with what I call "the dog, the officer "The dog.
The officer of what?
The dog, the official society of all the society industrial society is the west, "If we want to massimizing the well-being of our citizing citizen" is to male libert."
The reason for the liberty is in the fact that liberty is in the same a pattern, useful, useful, useful, useful, useful, useful for human beings.
On the other he's fact that if we are liber, every one of us can act for everything to do to do all of our well-being, without any of name in name our own own own nobody who decide in name our own own own nobody who decide in our own own nobody who decide in our name for us to do everything that is to do about the other than our well.
The way to massize the liberty is to male is to male choice.
More people choices the people are libere, and more liber, and more freedom is their liberty, and the freedom is their well.
There's a respectly running in society that nobody would dream of him.
And it's also deeply in our lives.
I'll show you some examples of what the progress has made possible.
This is my supermarket. It's not particularly large.
I allow a simple named on the conditional conditions.
In my supermarketetet, there are 175 conditions, without containing 10 variety of oil oil and 12 acets acets that you can buy to do a huge number of conditments in the circumstance that nobody has no 175 already already already already is to your degreat.
That's the supermarket.
And then you go to the snegotic snegotic to buy a stere: casses, CD, radio, plast, printing charge --
And in this single snegotic negotic number of of audio components.
We can do six million different and a half combinations using the components that there are in one negotid.
You need to admit that there's a lot of choice.
Other the fields: the world of communications.
One time, when I was a child -- you could get all the services of the phone wish, the cell phone that were sheets from mamma Bell.
He read the phone, they didn't buy the phone, you buy it.
A consequence of this, in the way, was that the phone doesn't break him.
These are the time of the time I went on.
We've got a variety of telephone, especially between phone, especially between cells.
Here is the cells of the future.
My favorite is the middle in the middle of the nose of the nose of the nose for the nose myself.
If you have not seen that you have seen in the negotic negotic negotic negotic needs.
And what the end happens is that people go into the negozoos and do this question. And you know what is the answer? The answer is "No."
It's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn't do too much things.
So, in other aspects of life that are much more important than the waters, it's the same explosion of choices.
Science health -- not happens in the United States that you go from doctor and the doctor you want to do.
Instead, you go from doctor, and the doctor says, "OK, could you do A, or B" "A, you could do A, or B" is these risks" and these risks. What do you want to do?"
You say, "Dr, what would I do that?"
And the doctor says, "It has these risks, and these risks, and Bs has these risk."
"What do you want to do you to do?"
And you rebat said, "Dror if she was her, what to do you do?"
And the doctor, "But I am not her."
The result we call it the autonomy of the malato," expression that makes it look like a beautiful thing.
But actually, it's not a shifting fish, and responsibility to take decisions from somebody who knows somebody else who know anything -- and almost certain is doctor, and so not in the ideal conditional to take decision, and so it doesn't know anything -- and so in the idea to take the patient decision,
There is a huge marketing products pharmacy products in pharmacy, direct to people like me and you, if you think of it doesn't make sense, that we can't buy it.
But if we can't buy it, why do we publish?
The answer is that they want dom, we call the doctors to ask them to change us to change the recip.
And so much fundamental as it's our identity is a choice, as you see in this view of choice, "We don't want to force the children. They will be able to force. They will not be investing the right now.
And we can reinvent us how many times you aggreat.
which means that every morning, you have to decide that kind of person, you have to decide that kind of person wants.
Rispace to the family and the marriage, a common time perspective, almost for anyone who was that you could get the most pretty much as possible, and he started the most pretty possible,
The only real choice was with choice, not go and even what to do to do later.
Ogame, it's really to play.
I teach students very smart, and I think about 20 percent less of work than a time.
And because they are not less brilliant, because they are less diligent.
but why are they impensierits, I mean I would say, "I should have then. I should do it?"
"I should think I have to think about before the children or careera?"
They're interrogatives of logorant interrogatives
And they try to answer these questions, even if this imply doesn't completely compitched the compitched and not get a good vote to my exam.
And they really have to do it. They're really important questions.
Now, the work: we lucky, like Carl arl technology us, because technology has to work every single day, every day, from every single of the planet, tranne that from Hotel Randolph.
And it's a corner -- there's a corner and I'll not tell anybody where, where WiFi Fi work.
You don't say that, because I want to use it.
What does this mean, this incredible liberty of choices we have to decide that we have to decide, and continuously decide, if we have to work or not.
We can go to the cell on the hocipe with the cell phone in the ball, Blackberry in the other, and the news team.
And even though they're all speaking, every minutes that we see our child we see our child and windate the part, "I have to answer this called "I have to answer this called "I have to answer this called "I have to answer this called called "I have to answer this called a hundred thing, and we can see our child that we see our child to be answering this
"I have to answer this email? I have to abbox?"
And even when the answer is no," all this makes the experience of your child very different from what would be in other conditions.
So, whatever we look at it, small things and big material, and big objects and materials and life, life is a question of choice.
Once the world was this: Ove, there were some possibility, but it was not a question of choice.
The world today today is like this: "Ilemma is -- "Is it a positive thing?"
The answer is Same ame ame is the story.
The positive side of them all all of the negative ones.
This is all this choice of two effects of negative effects on the people.
The first paradoxy is producing paralysis that liberation instead of liberation.
And so many options of the options that choose, it becomes very hard to do it.
You want to give you an example of mean -- a study conducted on plans of volunteering plans to flip forward.
A college had access to the data of Vanks at the Vansed, the gigants of though, with about a million clients of clients in 2,000 different companies.
What she found has discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are offered over the percentage of the adescenes of 22 percent.
With 50 sources of offers, there's 10 percent less than they have been available when they have they have available only 5. Why?
Because with 50 sources of the choice, is disease decidetail, and choices is remained to decide to ask the inomors.
And the questions, and asking questions, questions, and of course questions, and of course questions, and of course is not there.
You know that the decision that this is not just that these jobs are going to be able to chanoes because they don't have enough money, wants to say that the decision is so hostic that decision is so hostic that decision is so hot the founds of work.
Not teank, they're losing up to 5000-dollars per year from work, that would be well willing to crawing to the drive data.
So the paralysis is a consequence of having choices.
And I think that makes the world like this.
"And finally, for the eternity: ketchup, sense or major major major majory?"
You would like to take the decision if it's for the ethen, right?
You don't want to choose the source, and nep, and nep, the wrong condition.
So that's the first effect. The second is that even if we can avoid the paralysis and make a choice, at the end of the paralysis of how we would be stately choose.
And this for different reasons.
One of them is that with a lot of conditions, if you buy whom you have to choice, it's easy to imagine that you could have a different choices that would be better than would be be better and and have been better than would be be better than the alternative imagined in the sea patterns of choice, and the remains the relief of the relief the remote of the pressure that you could have to be able to have a different choice,
even when she was a great decision.
More choices us are easy to anymore, undispive of any details that insodden in choice.
But there's noticed the economists called the opportunity.
Dan Gilbert asked, very well stand like value what we do do with the things we confront of things we compared out.
In the stoptions when there are many options, it's easy to represent the alternative characterists of the alternative choices and less is choice.
Here's an example. I sent with all the ones that are not New York.
But it's what you probably think you probably do.
There is this courage to Hamptons.
A place of luxury place of lux.
It's beyond the beautiful day. It's all for them.
Nothing equipment is August, "Well, malesclear."
"Everybody all my neighs in Manhattan are vie."
"I could talk about my front of your home."
And it turns two weeks away, from the idea that it's losing -- every day -- every day -- the possibility of parking where it wants to do.
The expensive opportunity diminises the soddisftion for what we have, even when the choice was excellent.
And the more of the options we have to consider the more characteristics will be returned out to how it is constot to the expensive to the more constant.
Here is another example of that.
This view tells us a lot of things.
It turns out to live the moment, and maybe the live of live live at the moment.
But the most important point is that any choice, you choices you choices don't do anything else to do others.
The things that we don't choose have a lot of four that can make less attention.
Third point: growing spiral growing of expectancy.
I tried on my skin my skin and bought a couple of jeans.
I almost always jeans.
Once jeans were just a type of a white type and wind from besty and weren't comfortable to get them a lot of times, and they were working on a lot of times, started to go good.
So, I went to buy a couple of when the old ones were going, and I said, "I need a couple of jeans, this is my cuteans, this is my cutt."
The committed said, "You want to slim phit, relaxed phity, relay?"
Who wants to do you want to hed? "Stonebuttoni?
"Would you like the street?"
"Sots eight of them or strety? Bla bla -- -- he was elencare.
I was sbordity, and after a little I was able to say, "I want the only guy -- who was the only guy -- that was the only typo." It didn't have any idea of what I was so for all the diseases of jeans, and then I was going to have to be able to the best couple of jeans, and the best jeans that I had never had it.
It was the mas. And the whole choice had the best.
But I felt worse I was worse to me.
Why? I wrote a book to understand it.
The reason I was worse for that I was worse with the whole choices were altish altic waiting were lofting.
I had expectations I didn't expected anything else when I existed nothing when I see 100 of different in the waiting of 100 thousand in 100 different way.
What I had water was good -- but not perfect.
After I was talking about what I was trying to get to insumed with what I was looking at what I was looking at the waits.
The add of options in life of the people don't form expectations that these have respect to the excellence.
And this will produce less soddisftion, even when the results are good people.
No one in the world of marketing if you make it content.
Because if you know it, you won't know what I'm talking about.
The truth is more like this.
"He was better when she was worsing when she was wors." The reason he was better when she was worse when she was worse when she was worse was still possible to meet the ampleasant to meet of pleasant when she was still possible to meet the pleasant when he was worse to be able when she was worse to be able when she
Today, in the world where we live -- opulents, industrialized citizens with the expectancy -- the male that we can hope is that things are like the heith.
You never have you have never surprising because your expects, my expectancy, my waitts, and they have injuggling.
The secret of happiness -- what's here -- "Yes, Basses wait."
I mean, small moment self-hundred hand. And my wife is really married and is really wonder.
I would not have to do better, I didn't get it.
But you count not always a bad thing.
And finally, a consequence of buy jeans comfortable jeans when you have only that jeans is that when you're not satisfied and wonder, "Why?"
"Who is responsible.
The world is responsible. What could I do do I do?
When there are hundreds of jeans, and you buy a satisfying a satisfact, and you wonder, and you wonder, and you wonder, it's clear, it's very clear that the responsible you to you.
You might have a little bit better.
With hundreds of variety divariety -- there are no falling.
So when people take decisions, even if the result is the result is hear and they do feeling and gives the colp to their own hold.
In the last few years the depression is exploded in the industrialized the industrialized world in the industrialized the last few years of the last years,
I think a factory factory -- not the unique, but important -- this is that the ondate of depression is that people have deludition because the standards, because standards.
And when they have to explain this situation think the colp,
So the final result is that in general is that we do do things -- but we feel worse it.
Let me tell you about it.
This is the official dog, what we all take for good and it's completely falso.
There is no doubt that a little bit of choices is better than I haven't have a lot better than a lot better than a little choices is better than a little choice.
There is a critic, magic value of it. I don't know what it is.
But I'm sure we have been surrounded from a piece that the level where choices the best choices are the slightness of our life.
Now, from the political point -- I almost finished -- from the political point of view is the follow.
What it allows you to all this choice in the industrial society is the material.
There are lots of places in the world, and you know what the problem is not that have too much choice.
The problem is that they have too much of it.
So the face that I'm talking about is a malesclusive modern of modern modern and societies.
And what does it do depress and arrabblear is this: Steve Levitt's talked about yesterday's talked about yesterday. It's a spreadless of month. It's a spreken unprecies.
I mean, that these choices, complicated and dispending, it's not just useful to us.
They're the deleteries.
They do do it.
If a little bit of what in our society allows was to reverse in those where people have too chance was too chance was too chance to be improving but also now.
This is what economists is what economists is called paretian paretian paretian paretian paretian.
A redistribution is all of the reddiving is well in the poor -- because of this choices of this choices in excess that it tows us.
For conclude -- you can become all of what you want, "You can become everything --
You know, culture, you know, do you think about it, "What do does that fish do that fish sam?"
"It's obvious that you can't do anything in a mouse of glass glass of glass."
"As imagination, a vision vision of the world --
and I checked this on the beginning.
But then, thinking about, I realized that that fish the long way that fish the long way.
Because the reality of the facts is that if you sent in franks, so that "everything is possible." You can't get the freedom. It's a liberty.
If you break the mouse that you can become possible decreased the satisfaction.
You hehear the paralysis, and you reduce the well.
Everybody needs a sphere.
This is almost certainly too strected, perhaps for us.
But the absence of some symbolic symbolic for infectivity, temple, temple, for the road.
Thank you very much heart.
