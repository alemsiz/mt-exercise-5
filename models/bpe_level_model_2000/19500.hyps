I showed these slide last year, and then that the slide to demonstrate that calculation for almost three million years had the size of 48 States of 48 States of 40 percent of the 440 percent.
This is under the gravity of the problem because it doesn't show it the sky of the ice ice ice as the ice of the ice ice ice
The arty glacial calculation is in a sense, the heart of the global climate system.
It turns out and winverse and wind the wind of the wind well.
The next slide will be a floor, it will be a floors of the last 25 years.
The ice gaus are drawed in red red red red red them.
As you see, you go to the blue screen.
This is the ice in winver, which is the glacid.
You can see that the ice cosident glacid, five years or more, it's like the blood ske, which is like the blood ske, which is the blood of the body.
In 25 years of it was moved by this.
This is a problem because the interests is that the interests of the arty behind the ocean arttic amount of carbon gely, and they get found out in meters of methane methane in metaphang the microbies.
It recently the totality of the atmospheric act to global warming, that quantity could double, this amount of not return, this point of not return.
In some laghi deeper in Alaska foot in the water.
The professored professored by the University of Alaska has recated team a team of a team pressed a team in the winver.
Wow! Al Gore: Wow! Al Gore: Wow! As it is what if we will be also like.
A motive, this is that this scale of the growth of the Greenland is the north.
This is a glacium record.
The brought has never been reached with similar levels.
This is the Kangerlusaq, in the so-obest Greenland the Greenland
If you want to know how the sal level of the gain the sky level of the ice on terraferma, it's where the sea sea sea sea smare.
These rents are increasing increasing fast.
Another part of the planet: Antarcy the biggest block of the planet.
The scientists have decleared that the balances of the ice ice is in negative skin is negative, and that Antarctickets, which is particularly rapid in the skets of the skets of the game.
It is a six-levels of water, like in Greenland water,
The Himalaya, the third biggest block of glacium crashes, who were a few years ago they were away from the glacia.
40 percent of the world's population was going to be able to the point of the world's population that I mean.
One is the source of the water is the source of this city.
The door is increased.
But when you diminuished the same across the same as a popular water.
In California is in the Sierra Nevada is diminutes in the 440 percent.
The dype are in crisis.
The predictions, like you have been free.
The growth of the world at a remarkable increasing increases.
The environmental disaster to a rettremendous and without previous and without previous previous previous and without previous previous and without previous of the normal and without previous of the normal and without previous and without previous of normal and without previous and without previ
Four times more number in the last 30 years of the last 30 years of the previous 75.
This is a regiant gain all sustainable to the instance.
If you look at the context if you can see the consequences.
In the last five years we added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the oceans every day.
Look at the Aific area of the oriental Pacific forwards the subject of the continent -- and on the subcontinent -- where there is a impoor in the oceans.
Most of global warming rescale together to deforestation, which is 20 percent, is the use of the combusticsticles are using for them.
The oil is a problem, and the carbon is a problem, and the carbon is a broken worse is a problem.
The United States are one of the two countries with more emissions, together to China.
And it turns out to build a lot of other charbong.
But we're looking at a shift of direction.
These are the annullies in the last few years and some of the alternative versus of the versus of the versus of the versus of the last years.
Actually, there's a politics in our Paese.
The carbon and the oil industries have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote the carbon the last year to promote the carbon that is a oxyy-hox.
This picture reminded me something,
Natal, in Tennessee, where you live in Tennesse, and a 3.8 billion literal choories of carbon diox.
Maybe you saw it on the news.
This is the second largest flow of scories in America.
It happened around Natma.
The natalizes of one of the carbon industries was this one.
Video: Mr. Frosty the carbon is a type and happy.
It's abundant here in America, and it makes our economy.
Frosty carbon is more and more more and more more and more more and more more more and more more and more more clean.
It's about good price, lovely, and the workers keep the stick stick.
Al Gore: Do in the West Virginia.
The biggest society on the mountains is Massey Coal. This is his friend.
Video: Don Blands: Sarcharge, Nancy Pelogo, Nancy Pelogo, Nancy Pelove, Harry Reid -- they don't know what they're talking about.
Al Gore: So the Alleance for Proteon the Clim has taken two nails.
This is a one of it, a party.
Video: Ator: Ator we see the climate changes like a minm climate changes as a minm to our business.
So our priority is to invest a great amount of money in a very large amount of public and confuses the truths on the carbon the carbon the carbon the carbon the carbon the carbon the carbon of the carbon of the carbon
In reality, the carbon is not sport.
We think it's clean -- it has a good profum.
So not pretty much climate changes.
Let me do it for us.
Video: Aclean -- you know, I heard about a lot of it.
So let's do a game structure to a structure of the carbon as a clear floor.
Straordinary cars are a little rotype of the technology of the technology of carbon technology of carbon the technology of carbon the technology of carbon the technology of carbon the technology of carbon the technology of carbon the technology of carbon the technology of
The carbon is between the main the main rescaling the main scale of global scale and the remarkable technology of carbon that you see change.
Do a look at a charge. This is the technology of carbon digite.
Al Gore: Infine, the fine, the alternative question and economic questions and the economic of the national security and the national security of the national national security and the national issue of the national issue and the national issue of the national issue
Video: Man: Lay is in crisis, the economy, the national economy, climatics crisis.
The filter that the face that the whole of the move from the combustible combinable -- like the carbon and the oil croom and the important.
Now, there's a new skin new audience,
Lapower America: 100-big, in dieckets in diects.
They like to reput America in the work, make it more safer than it to be more safe to stop the global scale of global warming.
Finally, a solution that basts to solve our problems.
Lapower America. Scover more.
Al Gore: This is the ultimate
Video: They're about to redict energy to America.
One of the faster of the faster of the fast-dependence from combustible to our planet.
Expury is here. Vent, one new energy networks.
She has been beyond to the well-beyond work retribe.
Man: Repower America. It is time to be realists.
Al Gore: A old African old African old African says, "If you want to go to fast you, you go to you,
If you want to go away together."
We have to go away to move forward.
Thank you very much.
The year last year at TED phects a introduction on the LHC.
And I promise to go back to add you to how machine.
So I got out here. And for those who are not the other time -- the LHC is the greatest scientific experiment ever sent -- 27 miles of miles of sweets of circumstomer circumstom.
His comfortable to realize the conditions that were less than a billion second from the beginning of the universe -- until the second.
And this is simply simply environment.
This is the car underneath the machine in the Gineva.
We have a picture of these mini-Big Big Bang Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Bang Bang Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Biang Big Biang Big
This is what I work. It's called ATLAS -- is larger 44 feet and has a 2-feet and has a 22 feet feet of two feet feet and it has a 2-feet and it has a 2-feet of it.
This is a picture of ATLAS in building in the building so you can see the production.
Ten sectors of the last year we have access,
And this picture was taken by ATLAS.
It was because of immenses festrun in control.
It's a picture of the first of the first particles that had all the game of LHC, sentencing in collision, deliberated, deliberated, and diffupon particles.
In other words, when we see that pictures the 10 settember that machine, we understand that machine, which is a great liftye.
I don't know if it was to do it exultate about this when someone on Google and saw that the painitial page.
That means that we had a cultural impact in the scientific scientific to what scientific is that we had a cultural impact.
About a weeker, there was a problem with the machine, just had to these files.
These files are taking 13,000 printing when the machine works, the machine works.
Now, the technical technical of you look at files and digo, "It's not true. They're not too under s."
And they can do it because when they're very cosiddy becoming the surfaces of the superconvicts.
So, at least 271 degrees, in a temperature in the stars, these files can bring that the space between the stars, these files.
In one of the most of the most of the most of the magnets in the LHC, there was a remarkable defected.
So the files are surread to read read and 13,000 printed and 13,000 printed a resistance of electric.
This was the resulted.
Now, this is even more impression, if you think that these magnets are moving to 20 tons of 20 tons -- and that they were moved about 30 centimeters.
They are damaged about 50 magnets.
We had to take them to your basic thing, what we did it.
We have to repristinated and advanced.
They're now returning all of them in the ground.
Enthy the end of the LHC will be going to be new integrated again.
We will accenate it, and we wait for us to get the data or him, and continue so our wind or whatever it is the matter to discover what the universe.
Now, of course, in a certain in some places that they relivers the dibate of science and the engineering science and the engineers.
I think that the fact that it's so hard to go beyond the limits, I think it's the value of things like LHC.
I would like to conclude with the words of a scientist, Humphrey Davy, which is inuseful inuseful inuseful inuseful inuseful inuseful -- and he said, "No is so dangerous to the progress of the human mind of the human mind as the rise of the human mind as the science of the mind of the science that are not not in nature, and in nature that they are completely conclude us new to the world."
Thank you.
I want to start asking you to rethink about this kids, you play with the kids, you play with the battons.
While you realize them as well and realized them and move them and move them and move them and resolve them and solve problems.
The space of space is deeply connected to the way that we can understand part of the world around us.
So, by informath informed by the usecharged in our interaction, and I put together to my consults, and my consults, and my collaborator Jeevan Kalaniths, and when we use a computer, instead of the mouse as a computer, instead of the mouse as the gathern degital with a deployed information with a narring the hands, and we could debate with a handle bound-information with with with a handless information with with a sentency charge sless information that they can can can can can to the hand.
and we will be a system?
The question was so interesting that we decideming to explore the answer, building Siftable.
In pool words, a Siftable computer is a whole big interactive as a birth of a discover.
In pool words, a Siftable computer is a whole big interactive as a birth of a discover.
You can move with the hand, they can see it in the hand." They can feel the movement and have a wireless.
But about, I'm physics, as the battons, as the batts, you can move just to be simply to be simply to be able to be simply to be able to be able to be simply to be able to be simply tools.
The Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem to manipulate information.
And as they get more physics, and they are more physics, and others, and the others, and as they get more physics, and they hold them in the way, and they get more physics, and we can move and fun the different stils and different stilys.
I'm going to start with some simple example.
This is configurated to show you about video s: if you including it in a direction, the video it will be there, if you including it turns out of the other backwards.
These interactive ritriters, are consciousness of the others.
If they are interesting them in what they are going to be around it.
If they get circumstomer and they can agitate a little bit of it.
If they get circumstomer and they can agitate a little bit of it.
They also also have their movement and inclination.
We then realized that one of the interesting of the interaction was the power to use gestures on the data, for example, "ververversial are" as if it was a liquid.
In this case, we have three Siftable configurated as a seck of colors and I can use them to be a central colors in the central central central set.
and I can use them to be able to be able to the color, where they missing them to the middle in the central central central color.
If we can be too much, we can put a little bit of place.
They also are beautiful open-axietimes of logics and games of logics where people can try things to try things and see the results of logics and see the immediately.
I'm --
This is a Fibonaction that I do with a program of equations.
Here we have a game game words that is in Scarabeum and Boggle.
Pratically, to every turn in the Siftable, and in the Siftable, Pratic, in every turns a literally receiving a skle, and while you try to figure words a dition.
Then, after about 30 seconds remissing and you have a new set of sat and new chance possibility to try and new possibility to try to program and new possibility to try and new possibility to try and new possibility of it.
Thank you.
Here's the children came to the Middle Lab, I did it in the Middle Lab, and I gave them a video.
They are pleasures a lot of it.
And one of the interesting things that kind of apply apply is that you don't have to give people a lot of education.
You just said, "Look about the words, and they know what to do.
Here's the other people who tried it.
This is our most young best tester in the right.
It actually wanted to make it implements just implement.
They just were just basic him.
Now, this is an interactive apply a interactive apply card.
We wanted to build a tool for appreciation of the Lui is Felix.
It can inserve new characters in the scene, saving the Siftable to their associated with them.
It can inserve new characters in the scene, saving the Siftable to their associated with them.
So it's doing that sun.
Video: The sole is smiles.
David Merrill: Now he brought a treat the scene.
Video: The treat the year.
Bay work!
So schooling the Siftable and put them neighbors together and put the characters --
Video: Bau!
and inventing their story.
Video: Cia!
DM: It's a final story with open-open-in-in-in-in-broken story.
DM: It's a final story with open-open-in-in-in-in-broken story.
Video: Vole, you life;
DM: The last example I have the time to show you is a tool, realized to be a recently recently and exeguy and exeguy music.
it's a tool, realized to recently, to exeply and exequent music.
The Siftable here is the basic like the basic and the bacteria.
Every one of these has four different variation, and you can choose what use.
You can inserve these sound sound in a sequence to your feelings.
And to modify it simply to touching a "sound like a sequence."
These are effects that you can control the film and the filter.
Lattacks to a particular sound and then including it.
And then there are the general effects like time and volume, which is apply to the whole sequence.
Let's look like it works.
Video: DM: We're going to start with a basic in two Siftlype system, we are in a series, we add the system, we add other base.
Now a bag line.
Video: DM: Now on the top of the --
Video: I'm going to put the filter, so I can put the bacteria, so I can control effect from live.
Video: DM: I know to quickly the whole sequencing the whole sequences in the other side or the other.
Video: I'm going to add the filter, I'm going to add more expression.
Video: DM: I can recombining the sequence.
So I don't have to planning it before, but I can improvise, make it more slide or more corta.
And now, finally, I can get the entire sequencing the entire sequencing the Siftable to the Siftable "volume."
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is building new man-machine machine and more more more and more more looks like, our brain and body.
And today, I had time to show you one of the results of this perfect and also some possible possible that we try to bring out of the lab.
The concept I want to transmit you to this new generation of objects to interact with digital media designers, which will bring information in our world that we want to do in our world in our world that we want.
Thank you very much.
I don't see now to all of you.
They're a write writers.
Scare books is my professional but it's more of this obviously.
It's also the love and the fasin my life.
And I don't expect that can change it.
But what particular happened to be recently happened in my career, which has taken me to realibring the entire reported with this whole whole whole of the whole reporting of this work.
The particular thing is that I recently written this book, this biography called "Mangia, Prega, Ama," Ama," which is a different slibridge -- for some reason for the world and it became a big chellerg, and it became a little bit of interaction.
And the result is that everywhere that is everywherever they were treat me as if they were convicted to me.
It really -- convicted, convict!
They are now all worried and say, "You don't have to fear more to do you fear more to do we cannot be able to do better?
You don't have to be able to write to write all of life without able to create a book that can be able to create a book that can be able to someone who can matter somebody who can importing anybody?"
that can be to somebody who can you do it?"
It's running to resure it --
But it could go worse about the worst I remember 20 years ago, when I started to say people -- I was a adolescent -- I was a adolescent -- I wanted to be a writers.
I was in the same basic reaction.
And people said, "Don't do you have success?
Do you fear that the ubization of the refurns you kill?
You don't have to do this mestive for all of life without swoom that has ever come out and die to die on a heart of a heart with the shockings?"
You know, you know.
The short answer -- the short answer to all these questions is, "Si."
I fear of all these things.
I always had pack away.
And I also fear of many other things that people couldn't have to ine.
As it and other things often things and other things often
But as I realize what I thought and I was ask and I wonderful about it is why is?
Is it it is it?
It is logic, who have to waiting to be shopped by a work that feeling to do it.
But what is so particular in the impresely creative creative to make us reliative health instal healthy as other career doesn't do?
How do my father, for example, he was a engineer and I don't remember a time in his 40 years of the activity where he was asked if it was asked if it was asked to be engineer to be engineer?
It was not -- that block of the engineer John, how do you wis?
It didn't work?
Onestly, the engineers as group as group as group don't have certainly in secover, the reputation of being sent to be alcourage to be alcolized by reputation to the reputation of being easy maniaged in the reputation of being a clustery cutation to be alcockety ckimick.
We have enormous enthy this reputation, and not only doesn't only writers but creative creative of every general -- we have this reputation of being huge to be enormous instable.
And it's not rest that looks at the triste of magnific diaths of magnitude creative ins, and often inches and often it for them to hold them the hold.
And the ones that don't have to be really displayed to be really, they really disrinks.
Norman Mailer, before in the last interview of the interview said, "My book me a little bit more," a little bit more" -- a little more" -- it's a little bit more about the work of life.
But we don't bag when we heard these things that we heard these things that long as we completely interior indeed and accepted the notion that the notion and the soft that the notion and the soft that the news and the end, and it will always be always always going to anks.
And the question I want to ask all of the today is that I agree with this ideas?
It goes on this thing -- because it looks like a centimeter of a distance to me not good for anything this suppose.
I think it's odiose.
And I think it's also dangerous and I don't want to see it in the next century.
I think it's better encourage our great creative minds creative creative to live.
And I know that in my case -- in my case -- in my case -- it would be very dangerous to begin to that I heard of the supposed by the way, you know, broken the circumstances where they're in my career.
It is true -- look like like this, I'm very young to be a four years.
I still have about four decade of work in me.
And it's very likely that any writing nothing writing now in the world as the work that I used by the world as a job that he used to be successed by my last light in my last book.
It looks likely to be slavey, because we all more or less friends here -- it's likely to my greatest success is to the shoul.
Oh, Gesus, which I think of it --
You know this is the kind of the kind of thinking that it leads a person starting to begin to the morning.
I would keep doing this work that we love to do this work that we do.
So, the question become, you know?
And so I seed after a lot of reflections, which the way to work to keep writing is to create a psychological construction psychological construction to create a psychological constructive to go to write and then I can get to write to keep writing a psychological construction.
I have to some way to find a distance of security between me, which I'm writing to me, and my natural reaction that reaction to the next year I was trying to get out of the next year we start looking to see while we start looking through the time, trying to find other society to see if they could have more money, and trying to see if they could have more sane and secum and sexians and health sane and ses and health sane and and the natural sang of the sang society to do that I have write and security and san
how to help people creative to help people to creativity inerent inherently creativity.
And that research has taken to the ancient and Roma.
And then you get back because it turns out of the gain and then back.
In the ancient and ancient Rome -- people don't seem to believe that creativity seems to be believe that creativity to man, OK?
It was thinking that creativity was this spirit about diving and sell that came to a few surface and sunknown as wind and smart suspected away and unknown.
They called these demoniors called the demoney.
Socraties, wonderful, he believed to have a demon that elarged by long.
The Romans were in the same idea, but they called the kind of spirit a genius.
which is great because the Romans didn't think that a genius, they didn't really think a genius.
They believe that a genius was this kind of divince that has been live in the walls of a study of a artist, a little bit like the result of a nearly like Dobby, and that selling the nearly job of the artist of the artist of the job and modeling the result of that work.
Excycle -- this is the distance of which I think that psychological struction -- that psychological construction that you have to be a result of your work.
And they all knew that was so that it worked, right?
So the anti-form artists were protations from certain things, like for example, right?
If your work was exceptional exceptional could take all the market, everything knew that was helped by this incorporary genius.
If your work works, it wasn't all of your worker?
They knew that was your genius.
And so people concept the creativity in Occident for a long time.
Then the Rinascient came and all of change, and nacross this big idea; we put the human being on the center of the universe and no longer and no longer and no longer and no longer the creatures that write details from divinity.
This was the main of human eximuthm and people began to think that creativity creativity came completely from ishing.
And for the first time in history, it began to reference this artist as a genius, which is a pretty much that a person with genius.
And I have to tell you, I think it was a big error.
I think that allow someone who can be like a charge person to believe how a recipe of all the misteries of all my mysteries and the source of all my own own own too big and ethern is a film to too big squeeern to the human fragile fragile and ethern it is a very large film to be a fragile of the human beings to believe that the sources of all the broky and the eets
It's like to ask someone of trying to get the sun.
Deform and history and creates all these ingestiables on performance.
And I think it was this pressure to destroyed the artists in the pasts of the time.
And, if this is true, and I think it becomes and now, and now?
Can we can do it different?
Maybe you can go back to a more ancient understanding of the human relationship.
Or maybe no.
Maybe we can't cancelling 500 years of rational thinkers.
And it probably have to be a public that would be lithiwood-scientific susps on the notion of the notion that they follow their projects.
I'm probably not convince you all about this thing.
But the question I would like to ask is -- why is?
Why don't don't think it in this way?
Because it has more sense than any other thing that has ever heard to explain the impredictionability of creative creativity.
A process that has ever ever ever done to do something -- so much fundamentally, you all here -- you know, it's not behavior.
And, in fact, it can sometimes seem completely paranormal looking.
I did this meeting recently with the extraordinary poeter-Ruth Stone, which has 90 years old, but it was a poety for life and said that during his surface in the Virginia, working out in the wall, and I felt it it was in the walked from the countrack that was the reaching poethesize the reach.
He told it was like a bag trene.
And that was rotating to the line of the landscape.
It was to get to get the ground under the ground under his feet.
It knew to have a sole what to do to do to that point and he was like, "corrupt like a morning.
And so it turns out and then he was followed by this poethesia, and it would not have to make a piece of paper and a sky mathematic, and a fastonished match, and it turns out the page.
One of the other time that he couldn't be quickly, so corrected, and the recording and record without able to get in home and the poetry round and the poety and it would continued to rotate through the landscape and would continue to rocket."
Then there were those times -- this piece doesn't forget it -- there were no time that was the time that was almost lost almost perdend, right?
So, he was running home and he was looking for the chart and poety was going through a basic and then he was a mathemtheme in the way, and then he was going to go and then said, that it was like if you sat and the uffee.
It was a poem from the codle and the reputs in his body and the turns out of the payer.
And in these falls, the poety would be presented on the perfect and intact to the last word to the first maintains,
So when I heard about it -- it's price -- it's exactly equal to my creative process.
Not all of my creative process. I'm not a convict!
I'm a muly, and my way to work is to work is skill it is to save me and work and work on the right handing and go and go back and go on and go back and go on the godly.
But even in my head, in my head, I slightly meeting that thing,
And I image a lot of you have a lot of you have a dropped --
You know, even if the work and ideas and ideas and ideas I could not be able to be able to source.
And what is this thing?
And how can we relate to this way to not lose our head, but it is it to be able to realize sanies?
And as I realize, the best example I have the Musician that I have a musician Tom Waits, which I interviewed different day.
We were talking about this, and you know, Tom, and you know, Tom, for the major of life has been the contemporary artist, trying to control it, trying to control these species of emporary creative involved these species of embratiss.
But then he was driving it, and a day day he was driving on the under autootion in Los Angeles, it changed all for him.
It was just quickly and all of a tract of a sent track -- which is a little bit of a lodia, which is a inspiration, elusive and the wish and the wish and the wish and the wish and the desig, but not how to take it.
It has no paper piece of carda, it has no mathematic, it has no recorator.
So I began to feel this kind of old old old old old old it in the guy, and I'm going to lose and I'll get hossessioned by this channed.
I'm not good enough enough and I can't do it."
And instead of going to go into the panic panic panic --
I'll put the whole process and he did something completely new process.
It looked like the sky and said, "Scusa, you can't see that I'm driving I am driving it?"
"You seems that can write a song?
If you really want to exist, you know, it goes into a more opportunity when I can take a care of you.
One of them to be a other other other today.
You go to disturbing Leonard Cohen."
And his process working changed after that.
Not the work, the work was still as you seed as it seem.
But the process, and the fishing anxietime was released when the genius, the genius, the genius, which was nothing else and it turned it from the other things and reliber, and it realizing it from the income and mented and mind that he had to be a interiored and mind.
but well, this piece of sketling a conversation between Tom and this thing strange and external thing that lost was not Tom.
So I felt that story about changing a little bit of how I worked and already wind a flying time.
This idea, he saving when I wrote writing "Mangia, Prega, and falls in one of those class of those of the disperation where we're working on something and we couldn't think that it be a working and start thinking that will be a worst book, which will be the worst book ever written written written written written written to me written written to me "Mangia, and I written the sky w
Not just bad worst the worst book written written to written to be written to be written just book.
And I began to think of design.
But then I remember the Tom who talked about the air, and tries.
So I took my face on the back of the room. And I would say my comments to a room in the room want.
And I said, "You ent, whatever you we, both both that if this book doesn't be brilliant not going to be brilliant not going to be brilliant not be brilliant not going to be brilliant not be brilliant to you, right?
because as I see as I can see, I don't have more about that.
So if you want to be better and do your party.
Okay. But if you don't know it -- I don't know anything about it.
I'm going to write the same because it's my work.
And I would like to do that that was recorded to today I today today, I realized to my talk, it's like this, but it is like this, but it is in the deserts of the North Africa -- and the sky's mother and music and the skill and the sken and the floor and until the albe.
And they were always magnific because the ballers, and they were fantastics.
But every tankly, something happen, and one of these artists becoming in reality,
And I know what I know about what I know that you all of you talk, because you all of a point, a performance like this.
It was like time you stopping and the ballery walking through a kind of ballocked through a kind of a balloced by the sun, like 1,000 night -- but all of it was all of it in the sun, but all of it in the sun, but all of it would be a ballocked through a species of the sun, and the ballocked through a species of the sun,
And suddenly it doesn't just like a human human as a human human human human being.
But it turns out of the below and under the divinity of divinity.
And when this happen, you know, the people knew what it was, they knew what it was, called his name.
They were sent to hands and they started to cras, "Ah, Do, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God.
That's God, you know.
It has name story -- when the Morororders the south of the Spay of the Spay -- and pronunced this indead changed in the sections of "Ah, Allah, Allah, whoh, whatever you feel in the floor in the corres or in the float.
In Spay -- when a artist has done something impossible and magic "Oh, magnific magnific -- -- short crowles, and income, and a little bit of God.
And it's great because we need.
But the problem is the next day down, the ballern stame, when you see it and discovers that are the 11 of Martedge -- and I wish the 111, and the Doice is not more.
It's just a death, with the game, and maybe it can't be able to be able to be able to see that alteze.
And maybe no one chanters the name of God while it is it to do with the rest of his life?
It's hard to spread.
This is one of the most dolorous listening to make a creative life.
But maybe it doesn't have to be so ancient to be so ancient if you can not believe it, it is the most expects of your being being being from you come from you to you,
But it credests to you have data in prested by a imaginable, you know, the squisite that you have to go to someone else when you finished it in the indeed.
And, you know, if we think about this way.
And so I started thinking about it, and it's sure as I thought about a different months during the work of the book that public book that I would take the job, the dangerous journey, charged by my great deal with my great deal with the big success.
And what I have to keep on the electric when I feel electracks, I don't have paper.
Don't walks. It just your work.
It turns out to presentt your parts, whatever can be it.
If your work is ball, ball.
If the dive, you know, as you assumer a decide to let some kind of wonder, you know, for a moment in your heap, then you can get a moment through your heap, then "Ole!"
One of the same as your dance.
And "Ole!" to yourself the same.
I think I think and I think we debt it.
"Ole!" to you, even for you, just for love and text ttest to be delivered to be presenting to you continue to delivery,
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
As you already know about some of these projects on the human genome genome of what it can meaning and discovery new genes.
We're now starting a new engineer: we started to degitalize biology and now to go to a new biology and now now now now we're entering in a new biology, designing and synthesizing lives.
We always tried to take big questions.
"What's the life?" is something that many biology have so many biologists to figure out to wildness varies.
We tried to be different approaches, reducing it to the minimum minimum
We're digitalizing almost 20 years ago.
When we sequenced the genome of the human genome is going to go from the world of biology in the digital computer.
Now we asked us to do we regenerate new life, or creating new digit?
This is the map of a small organism, the Mycoplasma genitalium, which is the smallest species that can autoreplasma genome in the lab.
And we tried to reduce the genome the genome to create a little bit more smaller than a little bit more smaller.
We are able to eliminate a hundred genes of about 500 that are here.
But when we look at the right of his map map on the metabolic map to the notion.
You know, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can elimind, a very imlikely that this can bring to a live.
So we decided that the only way to progress to progress to progress this crowm in a way to make a deal to bring components to bring some of these fundamental questions.
And so we started the wind of "We can we spokill a cromother?"
It can make chemistry of produce to produce these big molecules that we never have been able to create before we never create before?
And, in case of business, can we make a cromother?
A cromosome, it's simply a piece of chemistry chemistry of chemistry is simply a chemistry of chemistry is simply a chemistry of chemistry is simply a chemistry of chemistry of chemistry is simply a chemistry of chemistry of a ch
The speed with which we can deal with digitalize life is growing the exponential life is growing to exponential with the exponential that we can deal with the exponential that we can deal with the life.
Our capacity to write the genetic code of write code -- but it's better slowing them.
And our most recently results the door of a exponential curve.
We started more than 15 years ago.
The process has requires a lot of past, beginning with a biothic reviewed the first experiments.
But we discovered that synthesize DNA is very difficult.
There are thousands of thousands of cars in the world that produce small segments of 30 to 50 to the world and it's a degenerative process. And it's a degenerative process.
So we had to develop a new metom to assembling these frams and recording to the errors.
And this was our first tent, to particular information from the digital information of Phi X 174.
It's a little viruses that kills killing bacteria.
We designed the framps and we actually made the correction of the errors and get a DNA molecules of about 5,000 liters.
The interesting part of it is when we took this piece of chemistry chemistry in the bacteria have began to read this code and produce this genetic code and produce the viralities.
The virals are then began to cell phone particles are cell back and have destructed the E.
I talked about recently with recently oil industry that they have certainly comprehended this model.
They have more voice.
We think this is a situation where the software can actually build the same hardware in a biological system.
But we wanted to do things in big things.
We wanted to build the whole cromosome.
They're more than 580 milar code code code of genetic code code of it.
So we thought of built it in the size of the size of the viruses, so that we can change the cassetets to understand what the class are components of a living cell phone components of a living cell phone cell cell of the viruses of the viruses, so that we can change the cassetets to make it cassets to figure
The projection is crucial crucial information in a computer, these have to be very accurate to be very accurate to be very accurate to be very accurate to a very accurate information
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 the first time in 1995 miles was a basic for every 10 miles the basic basis.
We found out of course, 30 errors. If we used that sequence, we used that the original sequence. We never have been able to do it work.
A part of the process is to designer set to the 50 levels that are going to be able to all the other side of 50 lects sken units smaller than the other hunits smaller who worked together.
We do it elements to the until elements here.
You probably have to read that we read about the big.
And think that is what we have a genetic code genetic code on four letter: As and T.
Three of those lects together with about 20 friamminoacid about 20 friends, and there's a specific orders to the skets for every minoid of the sket.
So we can use genetic code to write words, frather thinking,
What we did about the beginning was autograph.
Some of them have been deluses from the fact that it was not poeth.
We designed these segments to be simply to simply with the entire of the gaps.
There are imugs that repair and put them together and put them together.
And we started to assembling the particular segments from five to set a mile of segments in a way to form in a way to get about 24 mildle lect and to get 72 miles.
We produced these segments in the abundancing squarter so that we're trying to create a dancing procept that we're trying to create a proceive -- like you will see in a minute.
We're trying to automatizing the process.
So, this looks like the tabellons a basic tables.
When we go to these very long long segments very long as 100 mile basic slops will not grow more directly in E.
It turns out to the limb tools of the molecular biology.
So we have to look at other mechanisms.
We knew about another mechanism called recombination called recombination of biology, which in biology to repair the DNA degree to repair the DNA in the segments.
Here's an example.
This organism, called Deinococcus radiodurans, can make three million raid rad rad three million radication.
You can see in the squarter as his cromosometimes as his crowds.
In 12 -- 24hours is reassembled as it was before.
They are thousands of organisms that are able to do it.
These organisms can be completely squarter.
They can live below eight.
I'm absolutely sure that life exists in space, and you move to find new environments of water.
Actually, NASA showed that this avene.
This is a picture of the molecules that we built using these process, simply use the liview with the design design approaching the skin.
The liviview them axed the automatically.
This picture is not been taken with a microscope with a microscope with a microscope of a rular microscope with a microscope of a sky.
It's a very big molecular molecules we can see it with a microscope.
These are pictures that takes a period of about six seconds.
This is the publishing that we did a little time ago.
They're more than 58,000 letting code code code code of genetic code --
It's the largest molecules that ever created by the machine.
It has a molecular molecular to 300 million people.
If we were walking with a 10 paper sweet, you would like 142 pages only to translate this genetic code this genetic code this genetic code of this genetic code of it.
Now, how do we work it work? How can we activate it?
Obviviously, you can be a game game is a game game is a game game is a game game is a game game is a game game is a game game is a game game from a boyth.
It's a little bit more complicated when you use bacteria.
It's just simpler as a cell phone of the eucar cells as our res: you simply to be able to be able to be basically the nucleum and insert.
In the bacterium the chromosome, it's instead of the cell phone is instead of the cell phone that we are able to do a complete trapiant traping a complex cell from a cell cell and activate to one and activate to another and activate it.
We can have a cromosome, a microbial species
The two different are different as different as well.
We have add some genes in more way, to decide what choick to decide that chromom for this chromother.
It has a science that has been killing with the imupon ines.
And when we put it in the cell of the cell was stuff -- and you appreciate our chromodel, the new cell cell -- the new cell is gone inside the cell phone.
And we began that we couldn't go begin to be able to should, but we tried to push it in the middle there.
This is one of the most extremendous mechanisms of evolution.
We discovered that very much species have added a second or a third or a third of a few places in a second half of a second hundred new tracks that species.
So who think about evolution as a gene and time you modify it doesn't understood it has not understood for a biology of biology.
They are in the inner as the inement of restrion is that addictable, they have the DNA.
The chromosomes that was in the cell phone doesn't have a one.
The cell phone -- the cell phone that we inserito-ha.
It has expressed the other chromosome, and it has the other cromosome, it has masticked up with only the cell and we recognized with only the new cromom and the new cromom and the new cromom as a cromom like material.
it became blue blue because of the genes we insert.
And in a short of time, all the characteristics of a kind of a kind of game, and it turned into a new species, which we inserted in the new species, which we inserted in the cell.
All the proteins are changed, the membranes are changed, and when we read the genetic code genetic what we have transfer to what we have transfer to what we transfurther.
Now, this could seem alchemistry altering the software DNA we can change things in enough enough to make things in enough enough se.
Now, I have already explained that you don't talk about geness, but to progress from three million years and a half years and I said that maybe we're going to create a new version of the Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosion of this digital process.
Why do it this?
I think it's enough obvious when we think about our needed necessity.
We're going to spend six billion and a half a billion in the next 40 years.
Just to give an example: I was born in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for the planet for the planet for 1946, they will be four years,
We are doing problems now, and browing water and banity, clean and banity, medicinal and a half a billion people.
It will be more harder to do it for nine billion.
We are more than five billion carbon disease, more than 30 billion bars.
It means a half million barilds a day.
When we try to find biological processes or any kind of process to replace them, it will be a huge challenge to be a huge challenge to be a huge of a enormous processes to replace them.
We have to do it with all the way of CO2 emissions of CO2 emissions in the atmosphera.
At the today, thank you to scientific discoveries in the world, we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I like to think that they are designed to be the project for the future.
The electronic industry has just a dozen dozen about components, and think about how many different things are coming out of them.
Our lightly from the biological reality and our imagination.
We now have a techniques, thanks to these metoddds of synthesization, in grade grade the genomics of creating what we call genomics.
We are able to build a big robots that can produce a million chrobottom-to-day croom a million hundred chroom a million chrobots a million chrobottom.
Think of processing these 20 million genes of different genes or trying to get to optimize the processes to produce or drugs, or vaccines, we can change the vaccines, we can change more and create biology and creating more biology than in the last 20 years of science.
And it's just a standard.
We can chemistry for possibilities of survival, or carbon or carbon or carbons, production of vaccines.
This is an instantly some software programmed to be able to be able to be able to be able to seeing a computer.
Well, we don't know necessarily as they will be year.
We know exactly how their genetic code code code
Now we're concentrate on the focusing carbon of quarter generation.
You also saw you that you can be experiment from the grand the foot was a mess.
We have a second deal and third generation that will be pretty pretty much rather slow pot zero further than allock or different kinds of butanol.
But the only way that biology can have a great impact with a great impact with the cost of food, and limited the cost of foot and limiting the CO2 in materials, which we are working for cells that can reach these cells that can reach this discover, and we think we could reach this discover, and we think of the early enjoy in about 18 months.
The sunlight with CO2 is a methodo: but in our discoveries in all the world, we found different metodi.
This is a organism that we described in 1996.
It lives in the ocean deep in about 2500 feet feet of the water.
They put out of CO2 from CO2 ususing molecular energy.
We're trying to figure if we can instead of Chin2, which can be transported to be transported by your heard of your heart that CO2 in carbon this process.
So we could form that we could form to increase what the basic question is Not to increase what life, "Not the life." It's Not -- we have the very dest oil the entire industry the entire industry.
Well if you can't do it from TED, where you can we do it from TED, where you can do it from TED, where you can do it from TED, where you can do it from TED, where you can do it from TED, where you can do it from TED, where you can do it from TED, where you can do it from TED, where you can do it from TED, where you can't do it it from TED, where you can do it it from TED, where you can do it it from TED, where you can.
It would be a main energy.
And then we're working for using the same metods to create vaccines.
You saw this year with influence, we're always forth, we always always forward a dollar and a dollar, and it's a bucket.
I think that what you can change building combinabables in anticly.
That's how the future could began to be changing, now, the tree of evolution, accelerating evolutionary batteries, and infinally indeed, and infinally indeed, and infinally indeed, and infinally indeed,
We're so much from the best people.
Our purpose is to live to live to try to make it chelect. Thank you very much.
First of all I'm going to see the most quickest possible, a very foundly possible, the new technology that we took to Microsoft in the followed water in a year ago.
It's a environment that you can interact is a local level that remote with a huge amount of visivisivisivisivisivisivisivisivisivisivisivisivisial of visivisivisial data that you can interact with a local amount of visive data that you can interact with
And this is a lot of gabytells of photos with a digital zoom and continue, for a speed slips and continue to the pictures like we want.
And it doesn't matter how big amount of information that we see, how big we see how big data or images.
Most are communications -- but this for example, but this for example, it's a proscansion from Bilibrary Bilibrary of Congressss: and reented in the gamma of 300 megapc gam.
It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that limiting the prestations of a system like this is the number of a sky of the screen. It's also a very flexible architecture.
This is a internal book -- example, or of data not images.
This is the Casa desolater of Dickens. Every cool represents a capital capital.
To show you that it is just text and not imagine, we can do a thing of the general thing, to make a representation of a representation of the tex, not a representation of the tex, not a photo.
It may be a little artificial way to read a book to read electronic.
It doesn't be considered.
This is a more realistic. It's a more realistic. It's a number of the Guardian.
Every large image is the beginning of a section.
And it gives you really like the pleasure and the beautiful version of a view or a view or a view or a quotidian or a very simple of a very simple kind of meet.
We also did something with the corner of this number of the Guardian.
We created a public advertising to higher higher -- much more higher than in a normal published in a normal publishing -- and we inserve in the normal content -- and we inserve in a normal publish.
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobilex.
Or other models, or even the specific specific specific and it will be able to the specific specifies.
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminating the limits of the screen.
We hope that this means to put pop-up and other porks, and to other porkeries like to be necessarily to be necessary.
Of course, the maping maping is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology.
And on this is not lose to lose you, if we don't have contributed to drive in this field.
These are all the way in the U.S. It is a image of NASA.
So we're going to spend something else.
This is actually from the websk; you can go to the webs; you can go to see it.
It is a project called Photosynth, which combined two different technologies.
A is Seadragon and the other is a visual research of the very interesting computer in the University of Washington, with the University of Washington, with the Seitz of Microsoft and Rick Szelish Selish Szelisi Research.
And it's from Seadragonon the webbb, gestrange.
You can see it when we do this kind of screen that we can spend from a picture of a picture of the other skyet.
But the space collocaon images has actually actually a meaning.
The algorithms of visualization of the computer have recorded these images together, which correspond to the realal slide -- all the neighborhood on the Grass on the Montags of the Roccipe of canadic chanaiss -- you have been taking chosen with a slide-show show of a slide-stable levels of the space that you have all college.
I don't know if I have time to show you some other environment.
There's a lot more space space
I want to spend directly to one of the original data of Noah-- and this is a previous deal with Photosyntheside that we have worked for the first time -- to show you what it is really the key is really the asker to this technology, and it is really not necessarily to see the environments that we have put in the site environment. And it's not really really evidence to see the site that we have myself in the web.
We had to worry about the legal and saw it.
This is a rebuilding in the cedral rebuilding in Notre pictures from Flickr. Basta slide in Flickland. And you get images of these kinds of the field of the field of the field of the field of these connects of the field of this skill that is discovered to this model.
So I'm all pictures if Flickr and they were all colleged in space in this way.
And it's possible to navigate in this simple way in this simple way.
You know, I would never have been working to work for Microsoft.
It's very gratifiction to receiving this kind of pattern.
I think you can see that it's a lot of different kinds of different kinds of fun focamone: from those cell phone of the cell phone number of the cell phone number of the SLR, a Cl, a mess.
And if you can be able to try to seem those strange.
Many are block down, etc., etc.
One of some of the pictures of photographs -- etch of photographs --
This is a Notrecortling place.
We can go from the places to the physics of this environment.
The essential point is that we can do with social environment. This is taking data from all -- from the entire memory of how the Earth, from the point of visive -- and it turns out all those data together.
All of those pictures become college of the particular of the particular set.
You have a model of the land that emerge.
Think about this as a Stephen Lawler work on the Ter:
It's something that grows in complexity as people using it to the people usually usually to the people who use the indeed, they are involvantage with us.
Their pictures are marched with other people.
If you get some of the idea of converting all these ses says the name of Notreckedge of Notre Dydriving the cedral of all those dates, and I can use the data, and I can use the point of all those dates, and the way to the space of the space of the engineering and have an experience experience of the kind of a sross-modeling social experience of the set-model.
Of course, a consequence of all of this is the virtual extremely elaborated every interesting part of the ter, and you have a set of the plane and satellitaries, but from the memoria memoria and similar and similar memories and similar to the consequence.
Thank you very much.
CA: I realized well? What your software that your software will concert to be a certain point, in the next years, all the photographs that are going to be practically colleagues that would be practically collegse?
BA: Yeah. What is doing is basically discover.
It's creating to create hyperlin, if you want to be, between images.
And it's doing it in the base of the images.
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the recharge of the seed-information of these images that many of these pictures of these pictures of these pictures of the seedge.
How when you do a research images on the webb, you digitline and the web on the web page.
Now, what happens if that picture is all your pictures to all your picture?
So the amount of interconnection, and the amount of the seedy reckety that is really enormous amount of the retly.
CA: Blaise, it's really incredible. It is really incredible.
BA: You want to thank you very much.
One of the main of the main research and one of the research of the research of the ethetnic research that the anti-traditions, between the wind of the plants of the plews in the plews of plants.
Basts think that the amanans Jaguar is still beyond the Viiia, or that the world are still cool me are still listen to me -- or Himalayan that in the Dharma, or the bag of the Dharma, to remember the importance of the antropologia, and that the idea that we live not exists in sense that we live not exists in sense of reality, but it's just a model of reality, but it's a model of rerereality, but it's just a a modelyple modrop.
the consequence of a particular choices of choices that our stirps has done to the myself or myself as a lot of generations.
And, of course, we all share of essential trath trath trath trats.
We all all of it.
We are subjects to begin to begin in initiation.
We need to deal with the inesorability of morting, so we don't surprising and ballos --
We all have a art.
What it is the particular choices is the particular chang, the right of every culture.
It doesn't matter that they are the game, or the Borneo, or following the Voodoo door the Haiti, or the Kair desert in Kais: Curn the Kais: Curano walks, or a skellise in the heart of the Sahara.
He was my own own own month in desert a month ago, or a month ago, or a yak in the vallases of the world.
All these populations teachers that there are other ways of thinking, other ways of thinking, other ways of thinking, other ways of move in the world.
And if you get a mind of a moment, it's a concept that can give you hope.
And in the miriddle of cultures of the world create a spiritual life, and cultural life that you want the planet and it's important for the planet and it's important for the planet and it's important for the planet as the raise as biosphere.
And you can think about this raise cultural raising as a field ethnos: the total etho-like again all conceptive of all the conceptive ideas, inspirations, inspirations, inspired in the human floor of the consciousness of the consciousness of the consciousness of the consciousness of the consciousness of all the consciousness.
The etnos: The fantastic patrimonug.
It's the symbol, what we are and what we can be in how inquisist species and what we can be in how inquisist
And as the biosphered high-axed as it was happened to the etness, and purpose purpose and purpose purch.
No biologist, for example, it would say that 50, it was or on the extinction of all the species of the extinction -- in the most apocalculation -- in the most of the biological diversity -- and you don't have near the most optimistic of the cultural diversity -- that the cultural diversity -- that of the cultural diversity -- that of the cultural diversity -- that the most of the biological diversity of the kind of biologistic diversity of the skyyypothese,
The indict of all of that is, of course, the perss of the language.
When you're bored 6,000 languages on this planet.
A language is not just by a vokabolary or from a vocabulary or a series of rules.
A language is it should.
It's the mean the middle of every culture is in the material.
Every skin is a forest forest of mind, a thinking, a thinking, a thinking, a reual ecosystem of possibility of the spiritual system of the spiritual possibilities.
And those 6,000 languages as we sat Mounterey, at least half the half of the kids.
They don't come more teacher than you want to die, which means that they don't walk anything, which is already dead.
What is more tristers than the slide of being suned by the silent to talk a language, not to transmit a language of the wisdom or or anicipate the promise of the children of the children?
This is a realized that someone in some part of the world every two weeks of the world every two weeks a skyets and leads with squares of a relief bulsillabes of a ancient language.
And I know anyone of you will tell "Is it not better like that?
The world would not be a better place, if we all all the same language?" Benis: we all parlive yoruba. We all all love yoruba.
We talk to kog.
It turns out a track track what it means not to talk about their language.
I would like to do a journey through the ethnic etnishes --
a little journey in the ethnosing again of what we're love to it.
Many of us forget that when I say "different ways of exister" inting existing really different ways of exist.
We take for example, this bimbo Barasan Amazon the setters, the popular population that it creates to the milar of the best of the skin the milk of the sacride of the sacred sacrights.
It is a popular that it's not able to distinguishing the blue color, because the skelests is identify in the forest forest in the forest forest in the forest forest of the popul.
They have a strange strange and a mathemthematic, "exodd language, "Hewish lock of a person that talks about a person that a different language.
All of this has been in the miological past, all of the particular mysticular that is that in these family family six or seven languages in because of the matrimons nobody who practice a language.
They listening to listening and then they start talking about.
We take one of the most interesting tribes with which I lived in the Waorananans of Ecuador that had the first order, a very unbelievable popular that had the first contact in 1958.
In 1957, five of five of a comption of a cometting of a cometting of fact,
They made up from the photographs that they write them in popular that they were returned out that this popular population that this popular population has never seen anything that was never seen anything in the size of the size of the size of the size of the photographs that they were going to be able to the size of the photographs that were well.
They have a research of the ground, they have a research or a figura form or a figura -- they have conclude that it was divular with five and kills five with the five and kills five with the five and kills with the simission the lands.
But the Waoranananans don't just bills the skill them.
They kill in them between them.
Five percent of mortality was because of their mortality was caused by their own mortality was for five percent of the mortality was a 444.
We are risalititites and we found two cases of natural death cases of it, and when we insisted for know, they have messed that one of them was that dead death that has been killed that it was a toud of the same. All Risate." And then they had a knowledge of the forest of the forest forest of the forest of the forest of the forest forest that was really fold-well.
The criters were able to recognize the animal from 40 pass and recognize the species.
In the first years '80s, I was assigned a very interesting compit when my professor of Haititites I wanted to go to Haitititites to the Haititites to the base society and Tonton and Tonton Macoutes, and impossessed to make the choose, and impossessor to make the game.
To make sense to a miraculum a sense of the Vodouble.
It is quite a complex viewed views of the world.
Very interesting.

That sklide story not suggests that we have the answers to all the challenges that we have to deal in the thousands of the thousand.
When these myriades of cultures of the world is asking, they respond with 10,000 voices.
And it's in these answers that we all answer the chance of being what we are a consciousness to be what we have to do is that that all the popules and all the gardes can fire. And there are great moments of optimism.

which is that the wisdom of all the populations can contribute to our benefit to our good.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some things I wrote in this book that I hope to be called other than you heard and proverse to the other collegments, in case of collegments, in the case doesn't notice.
I would start with what I call "the dog, the offical."
The official official dog?
The official official of all the Western society is the Western official dog. And if we want to massimizing the bend "The way to be the well-well-being is to massimizing the freedom, "The way to remote the freedom.
The reason for the liberty that liberty is in the fact that the freedom is preciout, useful, because of human beings.
On the other he's in that if we liber, we can act for just connect to do everything that massimizes our good, without any one that decide in our own own own name.
The way to massimizing the liberty is to massimizing choice.
More choices people are liber, more freedom, and most of them is their freedodom, it's their benefit to the well.
This is so deeply that nobody would be deeply in society that nobody would be able to put it in the society that in the society that is so deeth.
And it's also deeply radicated in our lives.
I'm going to show you some examples of what the progress has repossible.
This is my supermarket. It's not particularly big them.
I just just a simple named a simple named on inspired it.
In my supermarket are 175 conditions, without containing 10 variety of olive olive and 12 acets across the balsh acets that you can buy a number of condition, the instead of the instead of the instead of the instead of the injugments that nobody has been been a lovely of your degradied.
Here's the supermarket.
Then you go to the snegotio to buy a stere: class, skin the CD, skin the CD, pattern.
And in this single snegotio electronic, there's a great number of components of the audience.
We can make six million different and a half a different half combinations that are in a room of a negotid.
We need to admit that there is a lot of choice.
Other the world of communications.
One times, when I was a child, you could get all the service phone to the phone of the crazy wish, and pact that they were sheeted by mam.
It was nowing the phone is not buying it.
A consequence of that, in the other, it was that the phone doesn't rock out.
These are the time they go.
So we have a variety almost most listening to the phones of phones in the cells.
Here's the future.
My favorite is what MP3, the MP3, cutting the hiddden and forces in the middle is brular bulight.
If you do not have seen in the negotid, you know, you're beyond below it to pretty much revery.
And what happens is that the people who are in the negozes and does this question and does this question is "No."
It's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn't do too many things.
So, in other aspects of life that are much more important than water the same explosion of choice.
Assistance of health health in the United States that you have to be a doctor and the doctor of the doctor of what you have to do.
And then you go from doctor, and the docts, and docts, "Okay, we could do A, or B" "A, or what's goods." And these risks. And these risks.
You say, "Dr, what should I do do?"
And the doctor says, "It has these good, and these risks, and these risk."
"What do you want to do that?"
And you can be well as well if she was like?"
And the doctor: "But I'm not lei."
The result is called the carto," is called the malato," expression that it seeming a beautiful thing.
But it actually doesn't really have a swote and responsibility to take decisions to take decisions to someone who knows anything that it doesn't know anything -- and almost certainly is not a -- and so in the conditional conditional decisions to take decisions to take decide to take decide that the patient.
There's a huge marketing drugs, I would say to people like me and you, you would say to people like me and you, if you think it doesn't have any sense, that we can't buy it.
But if we can't buy it, why do they public them do?
The answer is that they want to be able to ask the doctors to change the recip.
And so fundamental thing like our identity is our identity as you see in this viewed as you see in this views in this view the children. We don't want to force.
And we can reinvented us how many times you again the time.
which means that every morning in the morning, you have to decide that kind of persons you want to be it.
And the family and the mathemthematic, a time time prospective for anyone in the point, it was that you could get the most pretty much as possible, and you would start the most pretty possible.
The only one one was choice was with choice, not going to do it.
Ogay, everything is really to play.
I mean, very smart. And I think about 20 percent in less of a respect to a time.
And because they don't are brilliant not because they are less deligent.
but why I'm impensive to ask them, I would say, "I could do that? I should do it now?"
"I should be able to be more tary? I have to think before you do it or care?"
They're interrogatives --
And they are trying to answer these questions, even if this imply doesn't completely the compity, and not get a little bit.
And they have to really do it. They're important questions.
Now, the work: we're lucky, as Carl in the solineava, because the technology technology we allow every day, every day, every day from the Hotel Randolph.
To parents -- there's a corner, and I'm not going to tell anybody where, where Wii Fi works.
It doesn't tell you about it because I want to use it.
What does this mean, this incredible liberty liberty that we have to decide that we have to decide that we have to decide, if we have to work or not.
We can go to see our best kid to play cell with the cell phone in the high-cell phone in the other, and the news in the another.
And even if they all have a lot of the broad, we see our son wind the head, we also asked to say, "I have to answer this called the athis?"
"I have to be answer this email? I have abboth this liter?"
And even when the answer is "nothing that makes the experience of your balloons of your best very different conditions.
So, whatever we look, small things and big things and big objects and big materials and stils of life, life is a choice.
Once the world was this: Of course, there were some choice, but it wasn't all of a choice.
The world today is this kind of like this: "Islemma is a good thing or negative negative thing?"
The answer is She's like.
The slide of the slide of the negative negatives to the negatives
This is all this choice behaviors two negative effects on the gent.
The prim, paradox, it's that produces paralysis that liberation has been liberation.
And so many options that you can choose it becomes very difficult to do it.
I offer an example meaning: a study conducted planes with the planes of thinking about volunteers.
A college had access to the Vanketers, the ganti-society game, with about a million clients of a million clients in 2,000 different companies.
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are offered to the further of adescribes it is a 2-percent.
With 50 sources are 10 percent in less than ades in less than they are available to when they are available to only have 5.
because with 50 sources that choice, is maledetail, and the choices is remained to question.
And at the question and still asks, and of course questions, and of course questions, and of course it doesn't have the maintains.
You know that they don't just mean that these workers who are making food, because they don't have enough money, because they don't have money, it means that the decision is so ostick that the decision that perss that even the foundation of the dator of the data of the work.
Don't shot it all until it to 50, which would be well well as well to be well well to be a well-saving deal with them.
So the paralysis is a consequence of having choice.
And I think that makes the world like this.
"And finishing for the ethnize, or maintains or mainin?"
You would take the right decision, if it's for the ethnish, right?
You don't want to choose the bad wrong and the wrong condition.
So that's the first effect. The second is that even if we can evitself the paralysis and do a choice, we end up with less options of how we will be able to be with less options that we were with less options that we would be with less to the wildy that would be able to avoid with the parals.
And this for different reasons.
One of these is that with a lot of conditional conditions, whether you have a lot, and it's not perfect, it's easy to imagine that you would have been able to do a different choice. And what happens is that the alternative that the alternative imagined and the marrifishs the choice, and the remains of the choice, and the requid reended by the decision of the present present ent present ent ent ent of the choice,
even when it was a good decision.
More choices are easy to be delivery, more easy than anyone details of the choice.
But there's what economists is what economists call it cost is the opportunity.
Dan Gilbert asks, it was very well as the value that we are going to depend on what we confrontive to the things we confrontive to the things we confrontive to the things we confrontive to the things we confrontive to the things we confrontive to the things we confrontive to the things we confrontive to the things we confrontive to the things we confrontitive to the value.
And in the time you have so many options, it's easy to represent the characteristics of the alternative scarten and be less soddddiscovered and be less soddddiscovered.
Here's an example.
But it's what probably probably thinking.
There's this copy to the Hamptons.
A place of sky place of sky.
It is splendida. Otype day.
Nothing eat. But what he thinks is "Well, malidd."
"Everybody neighbors in Manhattan are vie."
"I could talk about it in front of it in front of it in front of it in front of the home."
And it turns out of two weeks assilled from the idea that is losing -- every day -- the possibility of talking to where it want.
The cost opportunity diminishes the soddddisplation for what we have is, even when the choice.
And more of the options that we have to consider the most of the characteristics will be returned to the cost of opportunity.
Here's another example.
This views a lot of things.
It talks about live the moment, and maybe live slowly.
But the most important point is that any thing you choice, you choices you choices not do others.
The things that we don't have a lot of four active that can make less attraent what we do.
Terge, spiral grows: spiral growing expectance.
I tried to my skin. I tried to buy a couple of jeans.
As almost always jeans.
Once jeans were a type of a type and wind them from the bestia, they were just bestia, just after took them a lot of a lot of times, they began to go good.
So I went to buy a couple new when the old old old ones were good, and I said, "I need a couple of jeans, this is my cuteans, this is my cuteans, this is my cute."
The broken said, "Li wants to be slim and fit?"
Would you like it takes it or with the bottons "Stones?
"Li takes them away you want to street?
"You get them to the bag or stretch, you know, the bla" -- "Wait was a broken to elenses to else it.
I was sleep, and after a little bit I was able to say, "I want the kind of cheat, which was the only guy -- that it was the only guy -- so I was going to all of the disease jeans, then I went out of the negotio, with the best couple of jeans that I had ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever had ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever done I had never done
It was the mas. Thats all that choicked the best choice.
But I felt worst I heard about it.
Why? I wrote a book interor understand it.
The reason I was worse with the whole choices that choices were altish altish altish were altis; jeans had to be perfect.
And I began expectations of minimes. I don't expectations when it existed a type, but when you go to 100 different in the type of different inside of them -- at least a guy had to be perfect.
What I had water was good -- but not perfect.
After I had talked to what I was chosen with what I was trying to insoddddrop in confront of it.
The add of options in life of the people don't really make the expectations that these have respectancy to the optiontions.
And this will produce less soddddisfation, even when the results are good ones.
No one in the world of marketing if you make it content.
because if you know that it was, you know, what I'm talking about.
The truth is more like this.
"It was better when it was worse when it was worse to the motivation that was better when it was worst when it was worse when it was worst it was even possible to meet the surprised please."
Ogay in the world where we live -- opulently industrialized citizens with the perfection -- the massive that we can hope is that things are like to the height of the aspectancy.
You don't have ever sources evolves, because your aspectancy, my aspectancy and are injatics.
The secret of happiness -- what you're here -- "Yes, wait."
I mean, little time I mean, little time I am -- that I really am -- that I really did and my wife is really stuff --
I couldn't do it better, I don't have been tell.
But you don't always have a good thing.
And finally, a consequence of the buy jeans comfortable when there is only the kind of jeans is that when you're not satisfied and ask you say, "Why?"
"Who is responsible to it.
The world is the responsible responsible. What could we do it?
When you have hundreds of jeans, and you buy a insoddddisplay a satissatisfic responsible to you, it's clear, it's clear, it's clearing that the responsible you to you.
You might be able to do better.
With hundreds of varieties have no choice, there are no for the success.
So when people take decisions, even if the outcome is well well as well as well as they walk in fact, and they make the same.
In the last years the depression is exploded in the industrialized world in the industrialized the last years.
I think a making meaningful -- not the unique, but important -- not the unique, but important -- of this depression is that people have experiences because the standard standard are too almost too alties.
And when they have to explain this situation thinking that the colp,
So the final result is that in general we are worse -- but we feel worse we feel worse about it.
Let me tell you you that remind.
This is the official dog, what we all take for good and it's completely false and it's completely further.
There's no two-broken that a little bit of choice, but that doesn't have a lot of choice, it is better than a lot of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit better than a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a choice.
There's a critic, magic value. I don't know what it is.
But I'm sure we have super-slide that we have super-half the level that choices the best choices that choices we have been a best for the best choice.
Now, from the political point -- I have almost ended -- from the policy, the core of the policy, the follow.
What it allows all this choice in society is the material recheth.
There are a lot of places in the world, and you know it is not that have too much.
The problem is that they too fall.
So the factory that I'm talking about is a disease, which I am talking about the Western in the Western Western West.
And what does it does and arrabbing is this is: Steve Levitt told you about iers as the constantly involved and comfortable to be involved and comfortable to be useful.
I mean, you know, these choices, complicated and dispendent is not just inuseful.
They're addicting.
They make it worse worst worse
If you have a little bit of what our society allows to choice, it would be reversed in those where people have too points too much as possible, but also the now.
This is what economists call a better paretian paretian paretian paretian paretian.
A redistribution, it does well well not just to poor -- not just to poor -- because of this choice in excess that it comes back to it.
And so he said, "Like, you can become everything you want,
You know, people culture, you think, "What does it believes that fishh weight
"It's obvious that you can't make anything in a wood."
"As imagination a viewed viewed viewed by the world."
and ankly I interpretated this to beginning.
But then, I realized that that fish, I realized that that fish.
because the reality of facts is that if you sent in the franks, so that "all it's possible." It doesn't have the freedom. It is the freedom.
If you put the mouth in a way that all becomes possible to deminate the soddddisplant.
You can be about paralysis, and you reduce the benefit to the well.
They all need a sphere.
This is almost certainly too strect; it perhaps to us.
But the abce of some symbolic symbolic symbolic charge, for rowina.
Thank you very much.
