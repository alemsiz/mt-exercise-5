Last year I showed these slides to show that the art calot, which is about three million years has had the artical chartice, which for nearly three million years has had the size of the United States in the United States, and it was 40 percent.
However, this underestimate the gravity of the problem because it doesn't show the these.
The artic glacial calote, in a sense, the heart of the global climate system.
It expand it reverse and return it into the summer.
The next slide is going to be a quick fast on the last 25 years.
The lost of them in the red of the red sheet.
As you see, you know, they expand it up to the Europe of the blue Europe --
That is the ice in the winter that reports of the summer.
You can see that the so-called the sea ice of five years or more, is like blood, which is like blood, which is the blood out of the body.
In 25 years has been from like this,
This is a problem because the interest reaching the ice of the ice around the ocean around the artical ocean where there are huge amount of carbon -- and the amount of carbon -- they turn into the metan from the microbes.
To the total pollution of the atmosphere of global warming, that amount of global warming, that amount of could double this point of not return.
In some deep in some deep deep in Alaska is already reboiling from the water.
The professorse Katey Walter of the University of Alaska rerected lake a team based last slake in the last one.
Video: Wow! Al Gore: It's good. The question is if we're going to be there.
One reason is that this is that this termal exchange the Greenland from the north.
This is a glacial record rights.
The late late has never reached levels.
This is the Kangerlussuaq, in the Southwest of Groenlands.
If you want to know how to be the sea level of the sea ice of the sea ice here is where the sea.
These currents are increasing rapidly very quickly.
On the other side of the planet.
The last month last month of the scientists have the beam of negative, and that the Western Antarctica, which is particularly rapid on some submarine islands is particularly rapid in the sheet.
Equival in six meters of water, like in Groenlands.
Himalaya, the third largest blocker blocking, you see new laghs, which few years ago were glaciers.
40 percent of the world's population reception in the higher water.
Sulle Ande: This is the bottom of the water water foundation of this city.
The late is increased.
But when it decrecreass -- the same acac water.
In California nevada is 40 percent.
The hydrogen kiss are in crisis.
Sorvessels, like you read, are grave.
The sea sea sea world that has a remarkable increase of the pregnant increases of pregnant in the world leading a sea world that has a remarkable of pregnant increases in the world a sea growth of pregnants.
The environmental disasters are up to a rhythm and without precedented it.
Four times the most numbers in the last 30 years than the previous 75.
This is a whole whole whole bunsustainable of all of unsustainable.
If you look in the historical context if you can see the consequences.
In the last five years we added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the ocean every day.
And look at the area of the East Pacific, from Americeast to the west parts of the subcontinent in Indian subcontinent, where there is an radical oxygen in the ocean in the oceans.
The greatest cause of global warming, together to deforestation, which is the 20 percent, is the use of fossil fuels.
Oil, is a problem, and the carbon is even worse
The United States are one of the two countries with more emissions, together at China.
And he was proposed to build a lot of other carbon central plumes.
But we're seeing a direction of a direction.
These are the projects in the last few years and some evils of greenhouse and some greenhouse reacts.
Any way of this is a political lotta in our country.
The carbon and oil industry has 250 million dollars in the last year to promoting carbon clean carbon clean and oxymore.
That image I reminded to me something.
Veryor Natalalalthough in Tennessee, where I live, there was a 3.8 billion gallons of carbon dioxial scories of carbon dial.
Maybe you saw it on the news of news --
This is the second biggest flow of America.
It was all about Natal.
The natalization of one of the carbon industry was this one.
Video: It's cooking carbon is a fallegry and happy.
It's abundant here in America, and it makes our economics.
Frosty the carbon is more and cleaner.
It's at good price, adorable and the workers are maintains.
Al Gore: From here is a lot of carbon of West Virginia.
The biggest minerary companian is Massey Coal. This is the Massey Coal.
Video: Don Blankenship: I'm going to clear -- Al Gore, Nancy Peales, Harry Reid -- they don't know what they're talking about.
Al Gore: So the Alleance for the Clima has launched two campaigns.
This is a bunch of beat.
Video: Attore: ALergy we see the climate changes like a nightful night changes like a night in our business.
For this is our priority is to invest a big amount of money in a commercial effort to make public and consumption.
In fact, carbon is not sporal.
We think it's cleaned -- it has a good perfuel of the way
So not preocured to climate change.
Let me do us.
Video: Attore: Can cleaned -- you've heard a lot of talk about it.
So let's do it a turn into a structure of the structure of the structure of the structure.
Straordinary! The machines are a little byy; this is the sound of the technology of the clean technology --
The carbon consumption is between the main causes of global warming, but the nievil of carbon -- but the night technology that you see it changes everything.
You look a look at this is the clear carbon technology of clean carbon technology --
Al Gore: Infinally, the positive alternative to the economic issues and the national security of national security and the national security of national security and the national security of the national security and the national security of national security and to the national security of national security and to
Video: Comment: America is in crisis, national security crisis, national climate crisis.
The filter that lines all the -- our dependence of fossil fuels and oil, oil and oil oil oil oil matter.
Now, so, there is a new new solution for the circles.
Rear America, 100 percent of clean energy in the 10 years.
A plan to put America to work and make us sure safe, and helping to the global warming.
Finally, a solution that you basts to solve our problems.
No America. You take a more.
Al Gore: This is the last one.
Video: It's about returning energy in America.
One of the fastest ways of end end end end up to the dependence that they kill our planet.
Comparsa: The future is here. Ventle, sole, a new network.
Comparently there is a lot of work work for jobs to work very well-retribits.
Compyment: Rear America. It's time to be realists.
Al Gore: A old proverbial African says, "If you want to go speed by money, you go out of itself.
If you want to go away together."
We have to go far away very quickly.
Thank you very much.
Last year at TED I did a LHC.
And I promises of switch to the way you can get to you on how the machine.
So here I am there I are. And for those that the other time they don't have the LHC is is the biggest scientific experiment, that was a few miles of circuits.
His task is to reach the conditions that were fewer than a billion of the universe -- until 600 million times a second.
All of this is just the environment.
This is the machine in the Ginevet.
We do these min-Big Bang in the relevels in the relevels of the relevel.
This is what I work. It's called ATLAS -- it's a 44 meters and he's got a 22 feet and a diameter diameter.
This is an ATLAT image in building so you can see the proportion of the proportion in construction so you can see the proportion of acular ATLAS in construction in construction so you can see the proportion of the ATLAS in construction so you can see the propor
The 10 section we have the car for the first time we accept the machine for the first time.
And this picture was taken by ATLAS.
It was because of immense immense in the control room of control.
It's a picture of the first particles of particles that had done all the LHC, enter entertained into collision, deliberately with a part of the LHC, and spread particles inside the relevel.
In other words, when we saw that 10 sector, the 10 sector, we realize that the machine works, which is a great live.
I don't know if it was this to do more than that, when somebody went to Google and the vide that the initial page was this.
That means that we had a cultural cultural impact beyond in the scientific impact on the scientific impact on the scientific impact of the scientific impact of the scientific impact over the scientific impact of the scientific impact of the scientific impact bey;
About a week later, there was a problem with the machine, had to have this problem here -- these sands.
These files take 13,000 amps when the machine works at the massive of the potential of the potential power.
Now, technical technics between you are going to look at the files and will say, "That's not true. It's just too subsidie.
And they can do this because they are very fresh becoming the so-called superconductors.
So, at least 271 degrees a degrees that of the space between the stars, these files can bring that that current.
In one of the junctures in the LHCEs there was a framework in the LHC, there was a framatic.
So the movies that are reading to read read about and 13,000 amps suddenly met a electrical resistence.
This was the result.
Now, this is even more impressive if you think these magnetfish over 20 tons and that have been moved about 30 centimeters.
They were damaged about 50 magnets.
We had to take them down.
We have repristined and upjusted.
Now they're coming back to their place in the place in the place.
I would be the end of the LHC is to new intea.
And we would like it, and we expect to get the data to just jump or him, and we continue that our adventure to find out what the morning, the morning.
Now, of course, in a way, these accidents reaccepending the debate on the values of science and engineering frontiering. It's easy to con. It's easy to con.
I think that the fact that it's so difficult, the fact of going beyond the limits, I think this is the value, I think the value, I think this is the value.
I want to conclude with the words of a Inglese, Humphrey Davy, the while, image, in the defense of the inutic experiments of his pupill, and his pupill, said, "No is so dangerous for human mind of the human mind of the mind of the human mind of the mind of the human mind is definitely that science is not mysteries in nature, which is not about the same way that our triumphs are not new mons of conquitting new conquitted by by the mons.
Thank you.
I want to start asking you on the way to the kids, you plays in the morning.
As you understand how to achieve them, and you can get them and to get them and move and you learn to think and solve problems, and actually solve relationships and space relations and spacecraft relationships and spacecraft relationships and make it and make it and make it out and make it and make it out and make it falls and to solve them, and you know,
The space reason is deeply connected to the way we understand most of the world around us.
So, from the informatal of our interaction of physical objects, with physical objects, and my Pacier Jevan Kalanithi, and I started asking myself, and my collaborator and I started asked, "And when we use a computer, instead of just as a computer polymers that makes it moves on a desk, we could make the digital conflict that you can get the phrase that you can get your hands,
and we can make it a pleaseasure of it.
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer, building the answer, building the Siftable.
In a words, a Siftable is a whole computer as a cookie.
In a words, a Siftable is a whole computer as a cookie.
You can move with the hand the hand they can see their movement between them, and they have a screen and a wireless.
But mostly they're physicists, like the morning, you can just move on on on the way, and they can just move it to business.
The Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem to manipulate information
And as they become more physicists, you know about the movement, of other people, and as they become more physics, and as they become more physics, you know, they become more physics, of how we die we did, we can explore new and fun fun style.
I'll start with some simple example.
This Siftable is configured to show vide: if you include it in a direction, the rooters like this, if they including it like this, if they include it in the other hand, you know, if they include it like this.
These interactive ratives of other people.
If they grain in business, it's interested in what they walk around them.
If they get circums, they see it and they can get a little bit.
If they get circums, they see it and they can get a little bit.
They also have their movement and uninclination.
We then realized that one of the interesting implications of interaction was the common data, as a common data, as a cooker as if it was a liquid to be a liquid.
In this case, we have three Siftable configured as a green buckey and I can use them to go and put them to the middle of the color in the middle of the one in the middle of the color in the case, where they mix them.
and I can use them to be put them to the central in the middle of the color in the middle of the color in the middle of the color in the middle of the color in the middle of the color in the middle of the color in the middle of the color in the middle of the color in the middle of the color in the middle of the color in
If we have too much, we can put a little bit of it.
There are also beautiful possibilities of learning, like languages, the mathematics and joining and the logical things and see the same thing as the speed things and see the results of it.
Now I'm --
This is a Fibonaces that I do with a equations.
Here we have a game of words that is in the Scarabeo and Boggle.
Orly, at every turns, you get a literal letter on every Siftle, every turns, I get a letter in every same. And as you try to compose with a dictionary.
And then about 30 seconds are remissing, and you have a new set of reading and new possibility.
Thank you.
And this is what the children came to the Media Lab, I made them in a way that they tried them and turned a video
They are very loved a lot.
And one of the interesting things about this is that you don't have to give you a lot of education --
You just have to say, "Compons of word, and they know exactly what to do.
That's what other people who try it.
This is our younger heads there.
It really wanted to be a smart.
They were only in the morning, for him.
Now, this is an interactive cardboard of a interactive cardboard.
We wanted to build a tool of learning.
It can put new characters in the scene, satis; they can switch the spot.
It can put new characters in the scene, satis; they can switch the spot.
So, it's getting out of the sun of the sun --
Video: Sun.
David Merrill: Now it led a treatment in the scene.
Video: The arancient treater.
Bel work! Yes!
So schooling the Siftable and putting the neighborhood can make the characters --
Video: Boo!
-- by inventing their story.
Video: Hello.
DM: It's a story with open final final -- and it can decide that he can do it as you want.
DM: It's a story with open final final -- and it can decide that he can do it as you want.
Video: Go -- folks --
DM: The last example I have time to show you is a tool -- made recently recently realized, to sample and exection exection and execures
is a recently instrument, made recently recently -- to sample, and executing music.
The Sifty here act sounds like base, low-down, and bacteria
Each of these has four different variations, and you can choose what to use.
You can also put these sound sound in a sequence to your pleasure to your pleasure your pleasure of it.
And then you just modificate it to the sound and a sequencing and a sequence."
These are effects that you can control in the live, like the reverberation and filter
You attach it to a particular sound and then fixes to upset it.
And then there are the general effects as time and fly and fly and fly and fly the whole sequence.
Let's look at how it works.
Video: DM: We're going to try a basic in two Siftable "sequenc," we get in a seriously, we extreme other base.
Now I put a bat line.
Video: DM: Now I add some percent of the --
Video: DM: And I'll put the filter to the bacteria, so I can control the effect of the live.
Video: DM: I can speak the whole sequence sequence by a time from a side or the other.
Video: DM: And I'm going to add the bottom to get more expression.
Video: DM: I can recombined the sequence "fle."
So I don't have to plan before, but I can sudden, make it longer or more corn.
And now, finally, I can sfuming the entire sequence by the left the Siftable "volume."
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is to build new interfaces more similarly like our brain and more similarities like our brain and body is.
And today, I had time to show you one of the result's results, and also some possibilities that we try to bring out of the lab to the lab out of the lab --
The concept I want to get is that it's coming this new generation of objects that are designed to interact with digital media in our world in the way we want.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the time to talk to all of you.
I'm a writer.
Sorry, books is my professional extra is more than that, of course of the way, of course of the books of the books of the books is my professional exist.
It's also love and the fall of my life.
And I don't expect to be changed.
But this is something that particular is success in my life and in my life and career, which led me to rericalibrate the whole relationship with this work.
The particular thing is I have recently written this book, this biography called "Mangia, Prega, a very different prizes of my precedently prized, for some books right up in the world and became a big sense, bestseller of interactional sensation.
And the result is that anywhere on me is that anywhere in the way you are convicted to me.
It's true -- convicted -- convicted a!
They are all over to me and everyone who were saying, "You don't afraid more to do than better.
You don't keep writing for all life without having more to write all life without more to be able to create a book that could care about somebody?"
that could care anybody?"
It's rassicurs, you know.
But it could go worse the worse of the 20 years ago, when I started to tell people -- I was a adolescent -- I was a writer.
I met the same reaction as the fear.
And people would say, "You don't know what to do with success?
You don't have fear that the humiliation of the reject kill?
You don't afraid to do this mestock all of life without anything that is never outside and die on a cart of saming bank cars with your bank bank bats?"
So, you know.
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is "I."
I fear of all of those things.
I always had fear.
And I also have fear of many other things that people can't guy.
As the heat and other things.
But as it was about the writing what I thought and ask me about the end of the way I thought about the last is because?
Is it rational?
It's logical that anyone should be waiting for being spent by a job that you feel born for doing.
But what is there is so particular in the creative impremise creative to make us nervous health of the other charts in a way that other careful things that other charts don't do it?
As my father, for example, he was a chemical engineer and I don't remember one time in his 40 years of activity in which he was asked if he was asked if he was afraid to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be chapter to be engineer if he was asked if he was asked if he was asked if he was asked if he was asked if he was asked if he was asked if he was about a little bit about the ch
It was never -- that block of engineer John, how do it happen?
It wasn't how it was that it works.
Onestly, chemical engineers like group don't have certainly in the sides, and the reputation of being alcolized.
We writers -- we have enough this reputation and not only writers but creatives of all kinds of kinds of unsticks -- we have this reputation of being enormous instable,
And it is not another looking at the tristage of the magnifies of the magnificent of creative magnificent -- only in the 2th century, they die young people and often for them.
And the ones that don't have suicide seem really disappeared to be in their womens.
Norman Mailer, before I die in the last interviewed said, "Of me killed a little bit more extraordinary about the work of their own life.
But we don't just just date when we feel this because we heard this so long that we heard this so long-way we completely completely interior and accepted the notion of creativity and suffering, and that art, at the end of the time, will be in a way that the art, and then will always be in the front of it.
And the question I want to ask all about today is that is: Are you agree?
And it's good for this -- because I look at this -- because I look at this -- not really good for anything about this support for anything that support is.
I think it's odious.
And I think it's also dangerous and I don't want to see the perpetuate in the next century.
I think it's better to encourage our great creative minds to live in.
And because I know that, in my case -- in my case -- in my situation would be very dangerous to start out to that the safe of suppositions, especially the circumstances in my career.
Of the -- I mean, I'm pretty young, I have about 40 years.
I have about four decades of work in me.
And it's very likely to write about that I'm going to write about the world as the work that came out of the world as the work that came out after the last book.
I'm going to be slavery, because we're all over here -- is likely to my shoulder.
Oh, Gesus -- what you thinking.
You know, this is the kind of thought that brings a person to start brought in the morning, and I don't want to do it.
I would keep doing this work that we do.
So, the question of becomes it --
And so I think, after many reflection -- that the way of work to keep writing is to create a perspective, right?
I have to somehow to find a security distance between me, which I'm writing about what reaction that was written about what reaction is going to be able to get out of the first models on how I started looking for time, trying to find other societies to see if they could have better ideas and healthcare and healthcare care and more society healthies.
how to help people create creative people to manage the inerent emotional risks of creativity.
And that research led me to the ancient Greek and ancient Rome.
Seguitems because it goes back in a circle and then back in.
In ancient Grece and ancient Rome -- people didn't look at creating creating that creativity from men, OK?
It was thought that creativity was this spirit spirit and that came out of men in some distant and unknown and unknown and unknown and unknown and unknown away.
We were called these are constitude of these seadians of creativity dives.
Sooood, wonderful, he believed to have a demon that height from the far of it.
The Romans were the same idea, but they called that spirit without a genius of spirit without a genius of the same idea,
which is great, because Romans didn't really think that a genius was a kind of smart of the genius is a particular smart of them.
They believed that a genius was this kind of divine entity that was created literally in the walls of the study of the artist, a little like the Dobby, and who came out to be hidden the work of the artical job and the outcome of that work.
Eccection -- -- there is the distance of what I talk -- that psychological costructure, that protect you from your work.
And everybody knew that was so that it was so that it works, right?
So antic artists were protts of certain things, like too for example, the too much narcissnarism, right?
If your work was exceptional work was not to take all the whole thing all knew that it was helped by this genius helped by this genius.
If your failed work failed -- it wasn't all all of your job work -- right?
They all knew that was your genius to be a unable of it.
And so people have been creating creativity in the Ocent for a long time.
And then the Renaissance came and all over this, and we put the human being in the middle of the universe over and mysteries and mysteries without more than we have to be the detailed space in the myself.
This was the principle of the humanity of rational humanity-in-related creativity was completely from the idivid;
And for the first time in history, it started to this or that artist like a kind of a rather rather than a person with a genius than a person with genius.
And I have to tell you, I think it was a big mistake that was a big mistake ward.
I think that allow somebody to believe that a simple person to believe being like a recipient as the source, the essence and the source of all the mysteries of all the divines, creative unknowable and a responsibility is a responsibility for human psys.
It's like to ask somebody to sun anybody to sun the sun
Deform and distores completely the ego and create all these ingestible ings.
And I think it was this pressure that I destroyed the artists in the past 500 years.
And if this is true, and I think it is, and it becomes it, and there?
Can we do it different?
Maybe go go back to a more ancient understanding of the relationship between humans and creative mystery mystery of human and mystery mystery of the human and mystery mystery of the relationship of the human and mystery of the human and mystery of the human and mystery of the human relationship of the human and mystery mystery of the relationship between human and creative mysters.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we can't cut 500 years of rational thinking, in a 18 minutes.
And there are probably in the audience that released scientific suspects on the notion of the notion of the notion of the notion of the notion of the way of their projects.
I probably don't convince you all on this thing.
But the question I would like to ask is -- why now?
Why don't you think this way?
Because it has more sense of anything that has ever heard to explain the exhibant, the exasperants of creative process.
One thing that is, like anyone who has ever tried to do something -- so, basically, all here -- yeah, not rationally.
And, in fact, it can sometimes look completely paranormal.
I did this recently with the extraordinary poet Ruth Stone, who has now 90 years, but that was a poetctually for all life and said that in his childhood, and he was in the wood, and he was in the field, and he was when a poetry from the lands.
He said it was like a fragorous fragorous train of the air.
And he was rolling to her landscape.
He was feeling to get it, because he was made to get the earth under its feet.
He knew it was to have one thing to do to that point and it was like, "current."
And so it was coming home and followed by this poem, and he wouldn't have any other than to take a piece of paper and a match pretty quickly fast as the translation, as the transform, and grab it it on the page.
Sometimes he couldn't be fast enough speeds, so it was fast and fair, and it was going to the house and the poem was rolled through and her lost and the lost and the lost and he would continued through the landscape, as he said, "another poet of the other poet --
And then there were the time -- this was not forget that -- there were times that never -- there were moments in which it was almost los; right?
So, he was running at home and she was trying to paper and the poetry a poem in the way that she was walking through and he was like, and then he was like to go through the other hand and the steel off.
He was the poetry of the tail and the released in his body and turned it on the page.
And in these cases, the poem would be on the perfect page and intacts but the contrary, the last word to the first word at the first word to the first one of the first word at the first one of the last word at the first one of the last word to the first one.
So when I felt it -- it's just crazy in my creative process.
Not all my creative process -- I'm not a conduct!
I'm a mule, and my way of working is; wake me up to the same orarium every day and sum and go on and go on the way and go on the way and go on the way and go on the same way of it.
But even I have stick in my head, and I stroked against that thing, at times.
And I guess many of you have been doing it.
You know, even if the work and ideas came to me from a certain source I couldn't be honestly say.
And what is this thing?
And how can we relate to this in a way we don't have your head, but but to be remain the way we can remain them?
As it resonates me, the best example I have is the best example I have is the Tom Waits, which I interviewed different years ago for a day.
We were talking about this, and you know, Tom, for the majority of life was the incarnation of the artist is tormented contemporary to control these species, to control these creatives of totally interiorate these totally interiorate species of interiors.
But then I ageed, and he was driving on a day when she was driving on a Los Angeles, changed all for him.
He was going speed and all of a sent this little bit of melodia, which comes in his head as it does the way inspiration, elutterly and the wish and the wish -- you know, it's wonderful, and the wish -- it's wonderful, and the wish -- but not how to take it.
It doesn't have a piece of card, not a match of a match -- it doesn't have a recorder.
So it starts to hear this kind of old anxiety to him in him like, "I'm going to lose and remarrushed by this lost song from this lost song always.
I don't have enough and I can't do it."
And instead of going to go in the panic stop.
And he did something completely new, and he did something completely new.
He just looked at the sky and said, "Hey, don't see what I'm driving?"
"Do you seem to write a song nove?
If you really want to exist, it in a more opporter when I can take care of you.
Other of them you go to to anyone else today.
You go to disturbing Leonard Cohen."
And his work process changed after that.
Not the work even even even dark as a seed;
But the process, and the heavy that was released when the genius was released when the genius was caused to the genius that was causing nothing about problems and the way we were coming from, realizing that he had to be a interior thing that was interior thing that was interior convenient.
But he had this peculiar collaboration with a conversation between Tom and this strange thing that was not Tom.
So how much the story started to change a little bit the way I was working and already and already rescued me a time.
This idea, I was saved when I was writing "Mangia, Prega, Amaado," and it falls in one of the disperation where we all all when we are working on something and we can't start thinking that it's going to be a disaster, which is never write about the worst book never written before.
Not just a bad book for the worst book write.
And I started thinking about throwing this project.
But then I remember Tom who talked about the air and tried it.
So I raised my face in the hand-up and I would say, my comments in a corner.
And I said, "Look, what I said, "What we know is not going to be brilliant not to be really she'll be bright right now?
Because as I see what I'm putting all of what I have, I don't have that.
So if you want to be better and do your own part.
Okay. But if you don't do it, you know it, you know, I don't don't do anything.
I'm going to go write the same because it's my work.
And I would like to favor that was recorded that I was in my own parte." Because -- at the end is like -- at the end of the North Africa in the North Africa people were dances of the North Africa and dances to the walk of the long dance and dance music dance and the wand-a-hours and the dawn to the dawn and the dawn to the dawn.
And they were always magnificent because the dancers were professionals and were fantastic.
But every time, I rary, rary, and one of these artists became actually transmitting it.
And I know what I talk, because I know that you all see that in all of you, at a certain point, a performance like that.
It was like the time you stops, and the dances walked through a kind of a portal and not quite a different from the sun, like 1,000 nights before, but all they fallen it.
And suddenly not just like a human being.
But you accepty in and delight-in the fire of the divinity.
And when this next one, the time this was -- the people knew what it was, they were called it with his name.
They had the hands and started singing, "Allah, Allah, Go Did, Allah, God God, God, God, God, God."
That's God, you know.
Curious note -- when the More invasible, they took this habits of the Spaper were to them and the footprint of them and the footprinted in the seats or in the stream of the wood, which is still you can hear in the folks or in flamen.
In Spaper in Spaper, when a artist did something impossible and magic -- "Hey, oh, Fah, magnified, exincomprepreprecent -- a last deal.
And it's great, because we need it.
But the problem comes the next day after that, for the baller's ballery and discovers that are 11 in the morning, and the Sin's last 11 in the morning, and the last last of God is not anymore.
It's just a death with a big dead to the knees, and maybe never will never be more to the one of that height.
And maybe nobody will be the name of God still as the yet, and what has to do with the rest of his live?
It's difficult.
This is one of the most painful rerecognization to make a creative life.
But maybe it doesn't have to be so angoshing if you can not believe that, in fact, that the most extraordinary thing that the most extraordinary of your being being come from you to yourself,
But it credit that you have been given by a inner imaginable of this squisite part of your life that you have to go to somebody else when you have.
And, you know, if we think of this whole change.
And so I started thinking about it, and it's because I thought about it for different months during the work of the book that I'm publick, the dangerous exist, the dangerous existed by my greatest success.
And what I have to keep telling me when I feel electried by this is, not having fear.
Let me just just your work.
It keeps for your side, whatever it could be.
If your work is dance.
If the divine, I assurd, I assigned you decide to leave some kind of wonderful -- for a few kinds of wonderful for one time through your efs, then "Ob!"
Other of them, do the same thing.
And "Oh, you know, you know, the same.
I think I think I should teach it.
"Look!" to you know, even for the human and tests and tests talks to the talks to the talks to the present of the talks to be continuously present.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
As you know, I've already talked about some of these projects on the genome of the genome of the new genes of genes.
We're starting to a new percorsoon -- we started digitalize biology and now starting from that digital code and synthesizing and synthesizing and synthesizing life.
We always tried to ask for the big questions.
"What is the life?" is something that many biologists I think they tried to understand different levels.
We tried different approaches, reducing the minimes of the way to the minimum of the way --
We're digitalizing for nearly 20 years now.
When we sequenced the human genome was treated to go from the analog world of biology to the world digital digital world of the computer.
Now we ask our: Can we take the life of this digital universe from this digital universe as a digital universe as a digital universe as a digital universe as a digital universe as a digital universe as a digital universe as a digital universe as this digital universe?
This is the map of a little organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, which is the species from the smaller genome between what they can autorous.
And we tried to reduce the genome to create one even smaller than one of the smaller.
We can eliminate a hundred of the genes of about 500 that are here.
But when we look at the metabolic map is relatively simple than the noadly at the note.
Believe you, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate -- is very unlikely to be a living cell that this can bring a living cell vist cell in the way that you can get to a living cell in the genes that we can get to a living cell in all the genes that we can get to a living cell in the genes that we can
So we decided that the only way to make the only way to make this cromodife so that we could make this fall-up the components to bring some of these fundamental questions.
And so we started the adventure of the "Can we can synthesize a chromosound?"
Can you make the chemistry to produce these great molecules that we never have been able to create before earlier there?
And in the classroom, can we make a chromosound?
A chromosome is just a piece of chemical material chemical material.
The speed we are able to digitalize life is growing is growing at the exponential res.
Our ability to write the genetic code, aging aging -- it's very slowly getting it.
And our most recently the results carried on a exponential curve.
We started over 15 years ago.
The process was asked a lot of the past of the process of bioetic review, before we started the first experiments.
But we found that sympting DNA is very difficult.
There are tens of thousands of cars in the world that produce little segments, the long long long as the longer is a degenerative proces: the more segment is degenerative proces: the more mistake we are.
So we had to develop a new method, to be these fragments and correct errors.
And this was our first attempt to start information from Phi genome of the genome of the genome of the genome of the genome of the genome of the genome of the genome of the genome of the genome of the Phi 174.
It's a little virus that kills bacteria that kills bacteria --
We designed the fragments, effective the resolution, and we got a DNA of about 5,000 literally 5,000 liters.
The interesting part is when we took this chemical material inert and we put it in the bacteria and we put it in the bacteria started reading this genetic and to make the virals.
The virals have been released by the cells, they come back, and they destroyed Es.
I talked about recent with the petrolifes of the petrolifes that they certainly understood this model.
They have more than you.
We believe that this is a situation where the software can really build his hardware in a biological system.
But we wanted to do things bigger on.
We wanted to build the entire bacteria chromosome.
They're over 580 thousand miles read.
So we thought we built it in the cassette of virus, so that we can change the cassets for what the components of a living cassette cassets to understand what the components of a living cell in the viventh cassits.
The design is crucial and if we start with digital information in a computer, these must be very accurate there.
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 the standard accuration was a mistake for every 10 mile --
We discovered, 30 mistake it down. If we had the original sequence we used that original sequence we never have been able to do it.
One part of the process is designing for a long sitting 50 letters that are overwhelmed with all the other segments of 50 letters to build up smaller underunits to work together.
We try to be one of the only one here.
You probably have bed the side that we put up the side of the lix.
And this is what we have a genetic code based on four letters: A, C, Gs and T.
Three of those reads together together code about 20 adminiopacy acacacids, and there's a specific order to every love with a snarrowing for every love --
So we can use the genetic code to write words, thoughts, thoughts.
What we did at the beginning was self-to do with it.
Some of them have been dolphin from the fact that it isn't poetry.
We designed these segments to just unitself to unimagazines.
There are enzymes that are and asymes.
And we started assembling from five to seven miles in a miletter to seven miles so that we could form sitting in a way to forming sitting at 24 miles letters to them when they were liter.
And every step we made these sit in abundance in the abundance that we are trying to create a very robate force that we're trying to create a very robute -- as you will see in a minute.
We're trying to automatize the process.
So, this looks like the tabellon a basket of a glass tabellon the ground.
When we get these very long six, over 100 miles -- more than 100 mile will grow up in the E.
You get to the limited of the modern tools of molecular biology.
So we looked at the other mechanism.
We knew another mechanism called a homological recombination of homology, which is useful to repair the way that can unive DNA in unimagazine DNA in unique DNA in the segments.
Here's an example.
This organism, called the Deinococcus radiation can ababsorb three million rads of radiation.
You can see in the upper square the way of its chromosome, you can see in the upper covery is destroyed.
In 12 -- 24 hours are reassembled exactly how it was before.
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do it.
These organisms can be completely sat at all.
They can live under a vacuum.
I'm absolutely sure life exists in space, and you go to find new rich and you go to the new rich environments of water.
NASA showed that this happens.
This is a picture of the molecule that we built using these processes -- just using the procession of the design of the remarkable of the design of the site of the unserious inserts.
The lievidence of the automatically.
This image was not taken with a electronic microscope, but with a regular microscope.
It's a molecule so big that we can see it with a slightly slightly slightly des.
These are pictures that cover a period of about six seconds.
This is the commercial we did a little time ago.
It's over 580,000 letter reads of genetic code.
It's the biggest molecule of a defined structure that never created by the man.
It has a 300 million of the upper hundred million.
If we stick it with a 10 unspaces without spaces, you want to have 142 pages to just get this genetic code.
Now, how do we work work? How do we make it work?
Of course, you get a virus is a guy play.
It's a little bit more complicated when you use bacteria it.
It's simpler even when it's eucarious cells as our remote as our remote and put it up another one other, which is basically the clone.
In the archaea chromosome, but we recently demonstrate inside the cell, but we recently demonstrate that we can do a complete train a cell and active.
We cleaned a party chromosomes from a microbial species.
The two are different as men from the topies.
We added some genes in the way that we could decide what to do for this chromosoon.
And then it took it up with the enzymes so that they kill all proteins.
And when we put it in the cell was stumbled -- and you will open our graphic sophisticated -- the new chromosome of it was gone inside the cell
And we were starting that we couldn't go further to go further than that, but we tried to do it over there.
This is one of the greatest mechanisms of evolution.
We found that so many species have added a second or a third chromosome somewhere in a thousand new trade in a second thousands of new tratts to that species.
So who think about evolution as a gene gene that is not really understood of the biology.
There are enzymes called restription enzymes -- that even digesting DNA.
The chromosome that was in the cell doesn't have one.
The cell -- the chromosomes we put in --
It has been expressed, and he recognized the other way as an extreme as a extreme -- and we found it with only the cell and the new chromos.
It became blue because of the genes that we have insert.
And in a short of time, all the characteristics of a species have gone lost of them in a new special new software that we put in a new software that we put in the cell in the cell phone.
All the protein has changed it, and when we read the member has changed and when we read the genetic code balance, exactly what we have transferred you.
Now, this might look like genetic alchemics, but altering software DNA in a pretty substantial fairly enough.
Now, I have already explained that there is no talks about genesis -- but of the progress of three and a half million and a half of evolution, and I already said that maybe we're going to create a new version of Cambrian explosion of this whole digital procal.
Why do I do that?
I think it's obvious when we think of our needs.
We're going to be six and a half billion people in the next 40 years.
Just to give an example: I was born in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for each existing in 1946; 40 years, there will be four years of it.
We're having trouble now to find food, water, water, water, fresh and drink for six and a half billion people.
It's going to be even harder to do that for nine billion.
We use over five billion of five billion carbon boards of oil --
That means a hundred million barrels a day.
When we try to find biological biological processes or any kind of process to replace them, it's going to be a huge challenge of me.
We have to keep the whole of the CO2 emission of these materials that end up in the atmosphere.
And so, today, because of scientific discoveries around the world, we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I like to think that are the design components for the future.
The electronic industry has only a dozen about components, and think about how many different things have come out of them.
Our limits are the principlely data and our imagination.
We have some techniques that because these sympts, these rapids of synthesization, able to create what we call a combinator.
We can build a big robot, which can produce a million chromosomes a day.
Think of process, these 20 million genes or try to get the process of getting to produce either and make more vaccines, new vaccines, we can change, because of a little team, and create more molecular biology now that in the last 20 years of science.
And it's just a standard selection.
We can choose for survival or survival or carbon vaccines etc.
This is a few of this is a few software programmed that we're working for being able to sit and design species at the computer.
Well, we don't necessarily know how they will they do.
We know exactly what their genetic code.
We're now focusing on quarter of fourth generation.
You also saw you see that you who are ethanol in the bade was a bad.
We have carbon depending on the third generation that will be pretty soon from the higher than the higher as the either as the either as either as either as a either types or different types of thrown up.
But the only way biology can have a great impact without increasing impact without increasing the cost of food and limiting the degree of food and limiting the degree CO2 in material, for which we're working for design that we are working for design cells that we can get this purpose and we can have the first carbons in 18 months.
The sunlight combined with CO2 is a methodom -- but in our discoveries around the world, we found different methods.
This is a organism that we described in 1996.
It lives in the deep ocean to about 2,000 feet of the water.
It creates meter from the CO2 using hydrogen molecular hydrogen energy sources.
We're trying to understand if we can put the CO2, which can easily be transported by touching touching through your carbon in the carbon in carbon to drive this process.
So we think we might be able to increase what the basic question that basic question is, what the basic question is, that the life," is the way Noi, truly -- we have the petrochemical modest of the petrochemical industry.
Exactly. If you can't do it from TED, where you can?
It would be a main function of energy.
And we're working in the same way to use the same methods to create instantaneous instants.
You saw this year with influence, we're always behind a year and with a dollar and a dollar, less when it's to find the right here.
I think that what you can change by building combinable vaccines in anticipy.
And that's how the future could start to look change, now, the evolution, accelerate evolution with synthetic bacteria -- archaaeucarian cells, archaaeucarian cells.
We're so much as we get to better people.
Our purpose is to make a way of living enough to try to do it. Thank you very much.
Before I will show you the most rapidly possible, a very foundly as a fundamental job as a Microsoft to be a pretty good year ago -- that's Seadragon.
It's a local where you can interact both of the local level that remote with a huge amount of visual data.
We're seeing a lot of gigabyty of photos with a kind of a continuous zoom and continuous fast speamic and continuous fast bread.
And not matter how big the amount of information that we see, how big the amount of information we see, how big these data collects or imagines.
Most of them are digital photographs, but this is a scale from the Library of Congress, and it comes into the legal of Congress, and it comes into the 300 megapixel.
It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that the predicts the prediction of a system like this is the number of pixel on your screen in any moment. It's a very flexible architecture.
This is a whole book -- example of data doesn't imagined there.
This is Dickens, Dickens, every column Casa a chapter of it.
To show you that this is just test, and not imagined, we can do something like this, to show really that this is a real representation of the text of test, not a picture.
It could be a little artificial book to read a electronic book book book.
Not I don't advice.
This is a more realistic example of the Guardian number of The Guardian hang number.
Every image is the beginning of a section of a section.
And it really gives you the pleasure and beauty experience of reading the heart version of a magazine or a fifth of a fifth meeting -- which is for nature a lot of kinds of meeting.
We also did something with the corner, in this particular number of The Guardian existence of this particular number of the corner.
We created a higher resolution to solve advertising -- much more higher than what you use is in a normal normal content -- and we put in the content contained contained contained contained contained contained contain.
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile, you can see here.
Or other models, or even specific specific techniques.
And this really shows some of these ideas to heliminate the limitations of space in the screen.
We hope this lady putting pop-up to the pop-up and other sibles, not to be necessary.
Of course, the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology.
And I don't want to lose time, if not to say that we have contributed to the field.
These are all the streets in the United States on a geost image of NASA geost image of the NASA
So now we go to something else.
This is actually from the living on the webs; you can go to see it.
It's a project called Photosynth, which is two different technologies.
One is Seadragon and the other is a very interesting research computer to Noah Snavely, a student of Washington, with the help of Steve Seitz of Washington, with the help of Steve Microsoft Research Szeli's and a collaboration. A collaboration. A collaboration. A collaboration. A collaboration. It's a very good collaboration.
And it's from the living on the web, and the way by Seadrage.
You can see it when we do this kind of screen -- where we can go from one image to the other kind of this kind of thing to be in the multiple resolution of multiple resolution --
But the space collection of images here actually has meaning.
The soul of visualization of computers have recorded these images together, so that they corresponding to the real places, where you imagined -- all the near Huhi Grassi on the Lahi on Mountains on Mountain Rocky of a shots of a sheet slide-stairs -- you see some of the panish -- and these things have all connected to space.
I don't know if I have time to show you some other environment.
And there are a lot of more space.
I want to spend a kind of original data set of Noah's original data, which is from a previous prototynthic Photosynth that we did work for the first time last summer -- to show you what I think is really the key behind this technology, Photosynthiest technology, Photosynthe. And it's not necessarily the environments that we have put in the website.
We had to worry about the aspects and so forth.
This is a rebuilding of the Cathelickr. Bastdigital images prefied by Flickr. Bastdigital Notre's Dame in Flickr and you get images in a shirts and other kinds of campus, and so forth. Each of these arms around. Every models that has been discovered to this model.
So they're all taken from Flickr and were all related to space space in this way.
And you can have this simple.
You know, I never thought I'd end up working for Microsoft.
It's very freely free to get this kind of acvast here.
I think you can see that it's a lot of different frames of frames of frames in the SLR, a meaningful number of fellow -- in this environment.
And if I can get the most strange.
Many are blocking, etc.
Something here is a series of photographs -- there are execcols.
This is a poster of Notreet From recorded correctly.
We can go from physics to physics to this environment.
The essential point is that we can do things with the social environmental environment. This is now taking data from everyone -- by collective interaction of how the earth of visual -- and all those data together.
All of those photos become connected together, the greater than the parts.
You have a model of the earth of the earth of the earth of the earth of the earth of the earth of the earth of the earth of the whole emergence.
Think about this as a prolunging of Stephen Lawler on earth.
It's something that grows in complexity as people use it, and the advantages that are useful for who uses are increasing with use.
Their pictures are marked with other people.
If you get the idea of a consigning all these sants saying, my picture of the Caths of Notrecial Dame sudrate of all those data, and I can use it as a point of getting into space, in that metaphor to the space, in that metapuniverse, using the photos of anybody and have a social experience of a cross-changed with a red kind of red type of red type of red-moil and red-red red red red red red red red shahead.
Of course, a consequence of all of this is the most interesting models of all the interesting of the earth, collective of the earth, collective just and plane and sible, but from collective images and sible, but by collective memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I understand good? What your software will have to do is that at a certain point, in the next few years, all the shared photographs from anyone in the world in the whole whole thing that will you be pretty much connect?
BAA: That's what is doing is basically to discover the oneful of the other.
It's creating hyperlink if you want to imagined.
And it's doing it in the content of the imagines.
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the rich of the ancient information that many of these images are in the same images that many of these images are there.
As you do a research for images on the web, you know, a fruiting and the web page has a lot of information pictures of the pictures of the picture.
Now, what if that picture you connect to all your picture?
So the amount of seed-up interconnection and the amount of wealth that is really really really really really really is me. It's a classical classical effect.
CA: Blaise, it's really incredible.
BAA: Thank you very much.
One of the pleasant pleasure when you travel and one of the ethnographic research is the way that has no forgeted the ancient of the traditions, between who has the past, the gate in the wind, the falls in the wind, the falls in the wind today, the folds it and plants.
You know, the skiamans still over the Jaguar traveling even over the MLattea, or that the elder, the elders of meaningful -- or that in Himalaya, the buddistance of the Dharm of the Dharm of the Dharm of the Dharm of the Dharm of the Dharm of the Dharm of the world in which we are not in sense, but it's just a pattern reality,
the consequence of a particular consequence of adaptative that our stirs has done, good or mal, many generations ago.
And, of course, we all share of essential tracts.
We all hid: We all make it.
We are subjects to start with initiation.
We have to deaths deaths of deaths and balances --
We all have a art.
What it hits is the particular rhythm of the canny of all culture.
Not matter that they are the Borneo, or the Korneo, or the followers of Haiti, or the Kaisesea Kaisut in Kenya secentrional chambers, the Curander's Curander's Curander's boats or a Saa.
He was my journey companing a month -- or a month ago, or yak walls in the Qomolange, on Everest, the mother of the world.
All of these populations teaches us that there are other ways of thinking, other ways of thinking, other ways of to be in the world.
And if you look at a moment, it's a concept that it can give you.
Inside, the cultures of the world creating a spiritual and cultural life that has a spiritual life that has been important for the planet and it's important for the well-being of the planet as the ragns as a biosphones.
And you can think about this cultural rhythnosm as an ethnosfer and you can define the ethnox, the total of all the concepts, ideas, inspirations, ideas, inspirations, ideas, inspirations, ideas, that inspired by the consciousness.
Ethnosm is the fantastic of human human being.
It's the symbol of what we are and what we can be in as a kind of inquisitive.
And because biosphere was really consumed as a as a very high as a fairly as a widely as quickly.
No biologist, for example, it would be that 50 percent of all the species was or on the bears of the time is just because it's failed -- in the most apocalittic diversity -- and in biological diversity -- and you don't even get to the most optimistic diversity -- that cultural diversity.
The indicates of all of that is, of course, loss of language --
When you're born 6,000 lings, there were 6,000 languages on this planet.
One language is not just composed to a vocabulary or a series of rules.
One is the language of the human spirit of the human spirit of the human spirit of the human spirit of the human spirit of the human spirit of the human spirit.
It's the means of the animation of every culture,
Every language is a forest of mind, a thought, a thought, a thought, a ecosystem ecosystem possibility.
And those 6,000 languages, and as we sit in Monterey, at least half of the time is not more sushed in the ears of the children.
They don't get more teachers to the children, which means less you shoot something, which is already dead.
What is the more sad of being the silence of being the last talk to a language, of being the last talk to a language, of not having way the wisdom of the hood's beeke-year-old guy?
This is a bunch of a few of the world every two weeks -- every two weeks a laughter and brings with it in the tombleet the last sillabes.
And I know that some of you will say "That's not better?
The world would not be a better place if we were all the same languages?" Benism, then we all yorumb. Parliamonous --
We talk about kogis.
You'll find a crossing what it means to be able to talk about their language.
Today I'd like to do a trip through the ethnosfera;
a little journey in the ethnosfe to give you a assure of what we're lost.
Many of us forget that when I say, "different ways of existing existing really different ways of to exists.
So let's take this Barasana, in Sepony, in Sepentrional Sepentrione, the population of anaconda, which creates the milittle, the mit of the sacric sacries.
It's a population that is not able to distinguishing color because the celvest is because the time you celest, is identified in the forest, which depends on the popul.
They have a strange language and a marriage rule, called "Hot exogamics language and said, "Health you can see a different language.
And all of that has roots in the past, yet the particular particular is that in these extremely extremely family in which they talk about six or seven languages of nobody is a language of a language.
They are limited to listen and then they start talk.
We take one of the most interesting tribes with which I lived -- the Waorani of Ecuador nordoral, an incredible population that has had the first contact in 1958.
In 1957 mission mission have attempted to a facal mistake in the facal mistake in 1957 mission mistake in 1957 mission was just a facal mistakes to be a facal mistake in the 1957 misionarized a facal mistakes.
They took them from the photographs that they would take them in a few who would think of pluvial local forest, dimentically that this population of pluvial forest, had never seen anything than two-dimensional dimensional.
They picked up the earth of the ground, and they were looking for a shape or a shape, not by finding now; they have conclouds, and they killed the five-mic and killed five miles with the lances.
But Waorans didn't just kill the stranimal was not just killed the foreign --
They kill them in the one of them.
54 percent of the death was caused by their own own themselves.
We have been eight generations and we found two of natural death and we found two of natural death and when we put in a way of them was aging so that they died in the age of aging so that it was doughs, and then they killed it itself.
The hunters were able to recognize the animal for 40 steps and recognize the species.
In the early 1980s, I was assigned a really interesting job when my professor of Harvard asked me if I wanted to go to Haiti to intruphoous society in the base of Duvaliver and Tonton Macoes, and Tonton Macoes, and Tonton Macoes, and immed to make the welended up with zombies.
To make sense of the miracle of the miracle culture, and that Voodoo culture, and that Voodoo is black magic --
It's about a metaphysical vision of the world.
Very interesting.
If I ask you, I will tell me the great religions of the world, what would I would say?
Christianist, Islam, Buddismo, and Ebraism, etc.
A continent is always left out, thinking that sub-Saharan Africa has no faired religious doesn't faiths. And instead of and Voodoo is not what the distilled of these very profound religious concepts of the slavery of the back.
What makes you interesting your voice is the intent relationship between life and more.
So you live in the spirits.
Eths can be invocated by the Grande Aqua, respond to the range and they replaced temporarily the soul of the way that for a short accountal actime-way to be the following becomes the dio.
So this is why you know, you know, "You know, you go to talk about God.
We give us in the time and become God."
And from the moment you are posses, is the spirit that you drive, how can you get mal?
So you look at these incredible events, you followed the voice in the state of trance that touch you get touches a rather demonstration of the power of the mind when it was catalyzed in a very exciting state of the first extreme in a very exciting.
And all the people who I lived the most extraordinary are the Kogi of Santa Marckets of Santa Marcketrional Santa Marckets.
It turns out that the ancient civil that once they lived on the career of the Colombic plans of the conquist, the population of the conquist, population that was going to be on the size of the carbolombic planet.
In a mackicated continents, this population never been conquered by the spagnowles.
And at all of them today are governed by a clack but their trained is decided.
The young followers are being taken by the family to three or four years and live in a world that are living in a world that we have a dark that stone secreated world to 18 years.
Two period of nine years of the way to reduce the nine months of management that spend the uter's in the world of the world of the Great Madre.
For this time, they get accultured to the values of their society, values that are previous to their prayers and only their prayers are they previous to be -- or for the ecologic balance.
And in terms of this incredible initiation, they suddenly have been brought and for the first time in the age of 18 years, they see a high school of the first first batch of the first one, when the sun of the sun -- all that they learned in theory is all of the speed in theory is all of its own splend. The prevented all of its own splende. The prey is a step and says,
"Vist? Proprio like I have detail.
It's amazing. Now it's about you protect."
They call them to call them the greater brothers and say that we are the hitting of the world.
This level of intuition is extremely important.
When we think of Indian populations and the environmental environment, we can see Rousseau and the old story of the noble of wild, which is a concept of roots in its simplity or maybe we can see Thoreau and say these populations are closest in us.
The Indian populations are not feeling or unsentimental or unreplaced by our algies.
There's not space for these things in the malaric palude and the gelides of Tibet, but because of the time and rits, they created a mystical of the Earth not about the concept of being aware of that they are conscious conscious conscious: the concept that the Earth can only be because it's infected by consciousness of human conscious:
What does that mean?
That means that a guy of the Ande that grows is a guy who is a mountain Apu that will lead the Apu that will leaved its destiny is going to be a very different and will have a very different relationship with the mountain or that place of a Montana credy that is growing a mountain of the moon of the moon of a rock that is a massive shake of rock that is a shake of a rock
which is the dimort of a spirit or a little bit of a mineral death is irrelevant.
What is interesting is the metaphor is defines the relationship between the individual world.
I grew up in the Britainbia believe that the forests that were going to be cut.
That made me a different human being different from my friends Kwakiutl who believe that the forests are the Hukukuk's dimora beadimore, and the drink historical beat the cannbal begins to the Huk's the gains that are living in the Hamata.
If you start to look at that these cultures can actually create different reality -- you can start to understand some sense.
I took this picture of the opening Amazon the Amazon Amazon Amazon Amazon Amazon Amazon Amazon Amazon Amazon Amazon --
Maybe some of you heard about the ayahuas, the most powerful psychoactive repertoial repertoial repertoial repertoies.
What makes it fascinating the ayahuass is not the potential for the substance of the substance of the substance, but its processing. It's made by two elements.
From a lian lex, this lian un-carboline and harmine and harmine molinogist and molits.
And by putting the only plants a fellow that alters a little bit of the consciousness, but it's measured with the leaves of coffee of coffee family's family.
This plants is triptamines, very similar to the night -- methoxyptamine-5, methoxyptamine-5, methoxyltryptamines.
If you will never see the Yanomami the substance that are the substance that make from a different set of species, even a methoxyptoxyptoxyptoxyptames.
Tirn that polymer's a little bit like being shooted by a fire of board, boots and landing on a board, and land on a sea of electricity. It creates a distorsion of reality. It creates the dissolution of reality.
I was often descanning with my professor, Richard Evan Shultes, the man who took the psychapteric was with its fungi in the 190s in the 190s in the 190s in Mexico.
And my text is not to classify these triamines like hallucinogens because if you're made not telling anybody to be hallucinated. But they can't be hurrange. But they can't be sure because they're denaturated to be denied because they're dened by a lot of course in the intestination,
You can listen to the orally only if you get out of other chemicals that denizing the MAO.
Now this is the beautiful carboline that are inbats inbats inbats are inbaters of the same kind of necessary for triptamines. The question is spontaneous question: in a flow of 80,000 species of plants, how these populations are not -- but if you combine in this way, do these populations are not but if you put them in this way, do we think of a biochemistry that is up-up to the part?
We use the great euphemism of the proof of the proof of the proof infrutted.
But if we ask Indians, they will say, "Plants talks about it.
What does that mean?
This tribe, Copah 17 varieties of ayahuas, which distinguished in the forest, and our eyes would go into the same species.
If we ask them how they are stabilizing their pockets will tell us about plants, "I knew what?" I said, "No."
The solution is: you take the 17 varieties in a night of the moon and each will be with a different tone.
And this is not going to Harvard, but it's much more interesting than to contain.
Now, [[unclear] the problem is that even the ones of us that have heart populations are painting them in the local of the story of our real world of the story of our real world and it becomes beyond in the real world and it becomes beyond in the real world to beyond the problem of the real world population and beyond to the problem of the real world populations that are also beyond in the several world of the marges of the real world in the real world in the real world.
In fact, the X-century, 300 years, it's not reminded for its wars or its wars or technology, but rather like the age that we are stopped and we have abbracked and so I actually have embraced the destruction of the planet. Now the problem is not change.
All cultures through the centuries have been involved in a dance for new life.
And the problem is not technology.
Indians have not being Sioux when they put on the ark and freezen and fresh fresh as Americans don't have being Americans when they put on the horse and hot part of the horse and hot cut down.
It's not the change or technology that threatens the integrity of ethnosfer. It's the power.
The last fly of the domination.
And if you look at the world, you will find that these are not destined to disappears.
They have living creatures and dynamics out of the existence of the existence that are beyond their ability to adaptation.
I'm disbodies of disbodies in the patries of thinking,
a population of Sarawak, in the south-year-old Sarasian population that has lived in the forest to a generation -- and now reduced to the rejection of the rivers of the rivers, where you can see the rivers of the rivers of the Merie Cinese Meria, where you can see the Japanese Cinese Meria, where the Japanese naves and the Japanese Meries and the Japanese Meria, where you can see the Japancercercercern in the Japanitor Merial Navi Japanese fitor or or of the Japanese riapanese cushorian
ready to fill the woods with the rain the forest.
Or in the case of Yanomami, are the diseases that have come with the discovery of the discovery of the discovery of the gold.
If we move on the Tibet, where I'm doing a lot research, where I'm doing a lot research, you'll see the harmor of political domination.
As you can know the genocide extraction of a population, but the destruction of a population, but the destruction of a population, not just conviction of a population, not just convicted -- but celebrated in certain environments, because it's part of the development of the pineategy of development.
And you can't understand the Tibet of Tibet until you go to the beginning.
I have the 6,000 miles from Chengdu in the Western Chengdoriental Chengdoriental in the Western with a young college, but only arrived Lhasa with a young line, but only got the statistics that we hear about it.
6,000 sacred moneys in the lung and energy.
1.2 million people killed by the military in the Cultural Revolution.
The father of this guy was listen to Panchen Lama.
which means that it was killed at the time of Chinese invasion of Chinese invasion of agencies of invasion of Chinese invasion of Chinese invasion of Chinese invasion of Chinese invasion of Chinese invasion of Chinese invasion of Chinese invasion of Chinese invasion of the Chinese invasion of Chinese invasion of Chinese invasion of the Chinese invasion of the Chinese invasion of the Chinese invasion of Chinese invades.
Her is was fighting in Santity in the diaspora that led the population in Nepal.
His mother was imprisoned and his mother was to be rich.
It was brought to be born the age of two years of the age of two years of hidden because, and he couldn't have had no lives.
The sister, who did the same, it was in reeduity field.
One day he had indicately hed a fasolk in Mao and this transgression, was forced to be in the force of seven years.
The Tibet of Tibet can be inhable, but the spirit of the population is to be present.
At the end, all of the time it comes to a choice.
We want to live in the worldwider world of the monotony or we want to get the policy world of diversity?
The big anthropologic anthropologic antropologist said that his greatest fear was that, in our way to this world's vision of the world, not only will see the entire legal legal of the thought, but a day we get up to a constant -- but a day we get up to a dimention of the though.
And it's humiliating to remember that our species is existed for 600,000 years.
The Neolition, which has given us the agriculture, which has made us to be the cult of the seed-up cult of the seed-up of the classrowing of the classroom -- creating 10,000 years ago.
The modern industrialized world has 300 years.
That squallida doesn't suggests that we have the answers to all the challenges that we have to go in the millennian to come to the millennia.
When these cultures of the world is asked what it means to be humans, they respond to be humans, they respond to 10,000 different voices.
And it's in these answers that we all risk the possibility of being what we are.
I took this picture of the north of Baffin, when I went to the Baffin, when I went to the whales with Inuit, and this man, Olaya, she told me the wonderful story of his grandfather's grandfather's n't.
The canadese is not always been gentles, with the Inuit and in the 1950s, to be able to be supremaintain colonies. We have reinhininininhouse.
The grandfather of this man refuted to go down.
The family, I was time for his life, he took all the arms, and all of its attention to the arms and all of its attention.
You must know that the Inuit doesn't feed the cold -- they exploited.
The origin of the origin was made of fishing fish.
The grandfather of this man didn't have been intimit by the night or the brought of the art or brought out.
It's sunched, and he got the pantalons in your own hands. When I made a little bit. When I made a little hand. When I did the photos are congelseen, their work creating a bama.
It has salively salively salively on this caccepts and when I was solar -- he killed a dog.
He brought the dog and created a brief, with the tower cassa has created a slittle, and it has disappeared on the band, and he disappeared on the band, and the caccepts in the stair.
And this is the same way to talk about horse? [Riss] And this, in different ways, [Applausilience of the Inuit and all the Indian population of all the Indian population of the world.
In the 1999 the Clrile government has returned to the Inuit the total control of an area of the biggest territory of California and Texas in the Texas I was together.
It's their new patria. It's called Navut.
It's a independent territorial. They shet all the minerars.
One of the wonderful example of how a nation-state can recognize with his population.
And finally, I think it's pretty obvious at least who we had to these remote areas of the planet, I realize that they don't have remote to be in remote that is not remote at least in the remote of the planet, I realize that they don't really have been affected to the planet, I realize that they don't really have been affected to be in the remote of the planet, I realize that they don't realize that they don't have been remote in these place,
For somebody is home.
They represents of human imagination that are reaching the dawn of the times. And for us all of these children, like the dreams of our children, becoming part of our children, become part of the hope of our hope --
Finally, we have National Geographic are convines that political will never get to anything.
We believe that polemicy --
[[unclear] are not persuasive, but we believe that stories can change the world, and maybe we are the best institution, to tell the stories of the world. Every month our website.
156 countries are transmitting our television channel.
Our magazines are lethes to people.
Our work is to get in the ethnosphere to bring our public in places that are wondering that they will go out of the cultural and cultural res, they hope they have seen it, hopefully -- the central revealation of the world -- the mers world to be in a plural world and multicultural walls of life world and multicultural world and multicultural multicultural world and multicultural
where the wisdom of all the population of all the population of our collective well-being
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some things I wrote in this book I hope to call the other than other than you already heard and try to look at some links, in case not notaste.
I want to start with what I call "the officer dogmay."
The officer dog's office?
The official dog's officer of all the Western officer and the officer official and the well-being of our citizens of our cities."
The reason is is a side of the side of the side is in itself a value, is preactively value, is useful, useful, useful, for human beings.
The other is that if we're free, each of us can be able to do everything that is that if we are free, not that they decided in the same way that mass our benefit without any name for ourselves.
The way to massive way of massive is to be the choices.
More choices people are more free, and the more people are freedom, the greater is their freedom, the well-being.
And I think that is so deeply rooted in the society that nobody would be dreamed to put it in doubt.
And it's also deeply rounded in our lives.
I'm going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible.
This is my supermarket is not particularly big thing.
I lost a simple note of the conditions for insalate
In my supermarket there are 175 conditions, without containing the 10 varieties of extracting and the 12 balsames that you can buy you for a huge amount of conditional boxes that no one of the 175 already already already already 75 ready ready to be a degreenhouse of your degrees of the degrees of your degrees of the inexpensive oil and the 175 of your reads that you can buy for a degree.
That's what the supermarket is.
And then you go to the electronic store, to buy a stere: CD, radio, reader, radio, plast, amplificator.
And in this single electronic negoor, there is a big audio of audio.
We can make six and a half million combination of different combinations using the components that there are in one negotis.
You have to put that there is a lot of choices.
Other fields -- the world of communications.
One, when I was a child, you could get all the phones, the cell phones that were going to be mostly fornes, the Bell.
He was reading the phone did not buy it.
One of that, in the way, the other one was that the phone is that the phone is not a makers.
These times, they went down.
We have a nearly illitate varieties -- especially between cellular cellular cells.
Here is the cell phones of the future.
My favorite is the one in the middle of the nose, reader MP3, cut up the nose of the nose and the bule.
If you don't have seen it in the house in the house store under the home, you're pretty well certain that will prestay.
And what the end is that people enter in the stores and ask this question. And you know what the answer issue. The answer is "No."
It's not possible to buy a cell that doesn't do too much of things.
So, in other aspects of life that are much more important than the water, you know, the same bumbesses of choices.
Ladish: health care is not going on the United States that you are in the doctor and the doctor what you have to do.
Instead, you go to the doctor, and the doctor says, "OK, we could do A, or Bebenefits, and these risks and these risks Bs has these sous. What do you want to do with that?"
You say, "Dr. Dr. What would I do to do that?"
And the doctor says, "A these benefits and these risks and these risks and the risk of these risk."
"What do you want to do that?"
And you can rebate about it, "What if she was me, what do you do?"
And the doctor: "But I'm not lei."
The result we call it "malathonomics of malato," expression that it makes it look like a beautiful thing.
But in fact, it's not a smoke and responsibility for some decisions by somebody who knows somebody's doctor, to somebody else who knows anybody knows anybody knows -- and almost certainly is sick -- and therefore not in the ideal condition, to make the obvious patient.
There is a huge market of drug products -- and people like me and you, if you think that if you think of it doesn't have any sense, because we can't buy them.
But if we can't buy them, because we can buy them them, because we can buy them it?
The answer is that they want to do in the doctor to ask for the changes to ask for changing the reception.
Something that is so fundamental is that we have a question of choice, as you see in this vigne, "We don't want to force children. We're not going to get a kids. They don't want to be a identity." We don't want to invent.
And we can reinvention ourselves as many times we get us aggrade.
That means that every morning, at the risky, you have to decide that kind of person wants.
And it was to the family, and the marriage of the common time, and in the common for anybody -- was that you married the most soon as possible, and it was the most presterated.
The only real choice was with while, not when, and not quiry, and even what to do with it.
Over the day, all is really to play --
I think of a very smart students and I do 20 percent in less work.
And not because they're less dright because they're not least, not because they're less diligent.
But why I'm imkings, I mean to ask yourself, "should I marry or no? I should do it now?
"Would I get married to think before the kids or care?"
They're all sorts of logarize now.
And they try to answer these questions, even though this implementing not completing the companies that I assegment and not get a good vote to my exame.
And they have to really do that. They need to do it.
Now, the work is that we are lucky, like Carl underlymes because technology allows us to work every day, from the except of the planet, except that the Hotel Randolll.
And parents, there is a corner, and I don't tell anyone who I don't want to anybody where where the WiFi works.
I don't say that because I want to use it.
What does this incredible freedom of choice that we have about the work? Is it we have to continually decide to work or not.
We can go to the hook at the hotter in one pocket in one pocket in one rate and the notebook, typically on the knee.
And even if they're all spent all the minute that we see our boy rovince part, we're also asked, "Does I will answer this call?"
"I need to answer this email? I have to email? I have to email?"
And even when the answer is "no," all this makes the experience of your game first-year-old boy from what would be in other conditions.
So, from any part of all, we look at all of these tiny and big things and style is a choices.
Over the world was this: Ove, there were some possibilities, but not all of a choice.
The world today is the world today: The dilemma is it is, "Is that a positive thing, or negative thing?"
The answer is the skills is the set.
The positive side of the positive lines, so I'm going to talk about the negative ones --
All of this choice behavior two actually two effects of the people.
The first paradoxy, is that it produces paralysix, instead of freation.
With many options in which you choose to the way it becomes very difficult to do it.
I give you a significant example of the plans of volunteer pension: a fluntary pensionary study.
A link of my colleagues has had access to the data data -- the giant companies of pension, with about a million clients in 2,000 different clients in 2,000 companies.
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are offered in the more, the percentage of planet, the percentage of the planet.
With 50 sources -- there's 10 percent in less than it was when they're available to only 5. Why?
because with 50 sources that choose, is very difficult decider, and choice is remainly difficult decider, and choices is remaintain the questions.
And to questions, and still questions, questions, questions, and of course questions, and of course they don't get there.
You know, not just that means that these old workers are going to be a dog because they don't have enough money, want to say that decision is so obstics that even the complementary sources of the workers of the dator of the workers of the dator of the workers of the dator of the workers of the dator of the workers will make.
Not participating, they're losing to 5,000 dollars per year from the dator of the dator of the dator of the dator of the data.
So paralysis is a consequence of having too many choices.
And I think that makes the world like this.
"And finally, for ethies: : ketchup, senapes or maion?"
You might just want to make the right decision, if it's for ethoking, isn't it?
You don't want to choose the wrong source, and the wrong condition of the wrong condition to the wrong condition of it.
So this is the first effect. The second is that if we can avoid paralysis, and we have a choice, at the end of the result of how we would be with less options in which we can be with less options in which you choose to choice.
And this for several reasons.
One of these is that with many conditions of the things that you choose and you buy one and not perfect, it's easy to imagine you could make a different choice that would be better choice that would be better than the alternative imagined us to put up the choice, and the remulti-fighting replacements the remaining soddisphery of the decision of the decision of the decision of the present of the decision of the present of the choice,
even when it was a good decision.
More choices are existing for any details of any details that is inherent of choices that is inherent option of choices.
And also what economists call it expensive to the expensive of opportunity to be consto-opportunity.
Dan Gilbert has very well stamattine as the values that we lose to things that we conduct from what we conductire.
And I mean, when there are so many options as possible, is easy to represent the characteristics of the alternative shooting of the option that is choice.
Here's an example. I get me with all the ones that are not in New York.
But that's what you probably think about it.
There's this couple of Hamptons.
a slow place of luxury.
Spillows splendid. It's all for them.
Not last, but what he thinks is -- "Well, malediption, it's Agoal."
"All my neighbors in Manhattan are alive."
"I could park right in front of home."
And it goes two weeks that we were being losing -- every day -- the possibility of parking -- every day -- the possibility of parking where it wants.
The expensive opportunity to the relief, is the satisfaction for what we have, even when choice was excellent.
And the most are the options that we have to be considered, the more the characteristics are going to come up against opportunity.
Here's another example.
This vigns a lot of things.
It's about living the moment, and maybe the slow.
But the most important point is that anything you choice, you choose to not do the other.
The things that we don't choose is a lot of active attractive that can make less attacting what we do.
Third point: The spiral growth of expectations.
I tried it on my skin skin a new jeans.
And I just just fellow to the nearly jeans.
Once the jeans were just typical and you buy them and dress were being being sous, and they were sususpected to a life and work a lot of times, starting to go good.
So, I went to buy a couple of new when the older they were gone, and I said, "I'm going to need a couple of jeans, this is my cut."
The committed to me, "Do you want to fit, relaxed slip?"
You want to cernier or with the bottonies? "Stonehed" or "aciidd?
"Do you want a little stret?"
"Well it wants to be or now? Ble the blah -- it was to elencare.
I was sanced, and after a little bit of I could say, "I want the kind of like -- which was the only guy -- that was so for an hour all of the stands of vacys; I had all the maleans, and then I came out of the negotis that I had ever had had had before, and the best jeans I had ever had before.
It was the male of it. With all that choice I had the brought the be.
But I felt the worse of that.
Why? I wrote a book I do to understand it.
The reason I was worse is that with all that choice is that with all the choice were expectations altises, the jeans had to be perfectly perfectly perfect.
I had expectations of minimes. I didn't expect anything that was when there was only one typical in one typic, but when I saw 100 different kinds of places, at least a perfect thing.
What I had watched was good at the one of them -- but not perfect it.
After I was confronted that choice with what I was trying to do with what I was trying to be in confronted.
The addition of the people don't do that increase the expectations that these are respect to the options that these are respect of the options of the options of the options of the options that these are respect in the life of the options that these are respect in the life of the people don't do that groundaries that are respect of the options that these are respect in the life of the expectations that these are not doing that much the expectations of the way that they have been the expectac
And this will be less sophistation, even when the results are good at the end of it.
No one in the world of marketing if it makes it matter.
Because if I knew that I am not going to know what I'm talking about.
The truth looks more like this.
"He'd better when it was worse that was better when you were worse is that when it was worse is that when it was worse to be even even possible to meet the pleasure.
Over the world we live in the world that we live -- opulent citizens with the expectation of the perspective -- the most of the expectation of the expectation of the expectation of the expectation of the expectation of the expectation of the expectation of the world we live expectation --
You'll never have never surprised because your expectation and expectations and expectations -- my expectations have been ingiant --
The secret of happiness -- what you're here -- is "Basict way."
I mean -- little bit of a fairly authored -- which is really married and my wifes is really stumy.
I couldn't do better, I didn't have to do better, I didn't have to do better.
But to be not always a bad thing.
And finally, a consequence of buying a couple of jeans -- you know, when you have only that jeans is that when you're not dealt and you say, "Why?"
"Who is responsible?" The answer is clear.
The world is responsible. What could I do with it?
When there are hundreds of jeans, and you buy a income, and you buy a income, and you ask you, the responsible is also very clear that you are for you to be you.
You could have better better than that.
With hundreds of varieties have unable for the insuccessful --
So when people get decisions, even if the result is valid, they feel incomfortable and damage their own same.
In the last few years of the industrialized world explose in the industrialized world.
I think a meaning factor -- not the unique, but important -- of this hondrug -- of this hondrug -- of this hondrug is too high.
And when they have to explain this situation they think that the guys are them.
So the final result is that we're going to general better, but we feel worse.
Let me tell you about it.
This is the official dog; what we all take for good and it's completely failed. It's not true.
There is no doubt that a little choice is better than it is not to have a lot of choice is better than a little choice is better than a little choice is better than a little choice be.
There's a critical value, magical value.
But I'm sure we overcome from a piece of the level that the choices better.
Now, from political point of political view, I have almost finished -- from political point of view, the nocile is the following.
What it allows all this choice in industrial society is the material and material.
There are many places in the world, and you know about it, where the problem is not that they have too much choices.
The problem is that they have too much a little bit of it.
So the fact that I'm talking about is a male-being sick exclusive, being exclusive, rich societies in the ground,
And what it does to be and angry is this: Steve Levitt talked about how the cost and swcomfortable and swwcomfortable seats are unuseful. It's a wasting of money.
I mean that these choices, complicated and dispendious, is not that they are just useless.
I'm also deleterious to be --
They make a worse of the worse of that.
If some of what in our societies societies are allows so much that people are too much possibility, it would not just be their life too much more than their life is not just their life to get better.
That's what economists call it paretian improvement.
a redistribution of the reveness is good to all -- not just the poor -- because of this excess in the except that it tors.
To concluder: "You can become all what you want,
Voy, people who are people in culture, they think about it --
"It's obvious that you can't make anything in a mice of vetrow."
"A construction of fall-up vision of the world."
and I also interpretated it like this, at the beginning.
But I think about it, I am aging -- I realized that that the fish long fish.
Because the reality of the reality of the reality of the reality of the reality of the way that "everything is possible," you don't get freedom.
If you go to the melelt in a way that all the possible possible diministration to the defation.
Wake paralysis, and you get well-being.
They all need a sphere.
This is almost certainly too closely too closed, maybe for us.
But the absence of some smooth symbolic is a recipe for infelicity, and I am for the ruin the same way for the wine --
Thank you for heart.
