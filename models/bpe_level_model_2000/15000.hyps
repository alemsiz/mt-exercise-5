The last year I showed these slides to show that the slide that the glacial calm that for almost three million years had the size of 40 million years of 40 percent of the United States of 40 percent.
This is the gravity of the gravity of the problem because it doesn't show it as the glacium.
The art glacial climb, the art is in a sense, the cuor clean global climate system.
You expands of inverse and wind and wind the same.
The next debor is going to be a floor, the next 25 years.
The nice enabled --
As you see, you expanding up to the blue slights.
That's the ice in the winver, which is the same.
You can see that the ice cosident glacior fly years or more, five years or floors -- it's like the blood blood from the body.
In 25 years was spent like this, at the time of that.
This is a problem because the interested scale terrain the lacior in the ocean art where there are huge amount of carbon and congelated that scientists are transformed to methang from the microbie.
Rispaces to the totality of the atmospheric inquinition of global rescaling could radid, surround this point of not writor.
In some laghi hi hots in Alaska hot he's already rebolling from water.
The professor, Katey Walter of the University of Alaska team is recated with a team pressed a lake of the basic lage.
Video: Wow! Al Gore: Wow! Al Gore: Wow! He's going to be along.
One reason is that this environment of the Greenland from the Groenland from the norther.
This is a glacial record.
The levels had never reached levels similar levels like this.
This is the Kangerlusuuum of Greenland of the Greenland of Greenland
If you want to know how the slevel of the level of the gain on terrafer, here is where the sea level of the level of the level of the level of the level of the level of the level of the level of the sand.
These rents are increasinging rapidly.
On the other planet: Antarctica, the largest block of the planet.
The scientist chop scientists have dichiared that the bunch of the ice is negative slightly and the Western slands, which is particularly rapid in the sline of the slightly rapid in the scientists.

The predictions, as you get away -- it's graved.
The growth of the world at the world at the land at the engineer of incendis.
The environmental disasters are increasing a recorded out of the normal and no precedent.
Four flight times in the last 30 years of the previous previous previous previous flies of 75.
This is a reaching of the insustainable.
If you look at the context of the story of the story of the consequences.
In the last five years we added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the ocean in the oceans every day.
Look at the oriently the oriental of the oriental Pacific parts of the norm, and on the subject parts of the continent -- where there's a radical radical radical radical of the oxygen in the oceans.
The most of global warming of global warming, and deforestation, which is 20, is the usual efforest of combinable deforest.
The oil is a problem, and the carbon is lost of the charge is even even even worse
The United States are one of the most emissions, with the Cina.
And it was a lot of other central central of carbon of carbon of carbon and and the carbon of carbon of the carbon of the carbon of the carbon of the carbon of the carbon of the carbon of the carbon of the carbon of the carbon of the carbon of the carbon of the carb.
But we're doing a change, in the short of direction.
These are the baby projects in the last few years and some proposed to the verdies of alternative ress.
At every way, there's a political loty in our country.
The carbon industry and oil industry have 250 million dollars in the last year to promote the carbon of the carbon of the carbon of the carbon of the carbon of the carbon of the carbon and of the carbon industry in the last year of the carbon industry in the last year of the carbon
This is the image of what --
I know Nath Nath Tenness, where I lived -- there's been a 3.8 billion litererals of charb.
Maybe you saw the sware news on the swim.
This is the second largest flexiety flexiety flexiety flexiety flexies.
It's happened around Natal.

It's abondant here in America, and it's growing our economy.
Frosty the carbon is always more clean hundred is more and bigger and frosty carbon is the carbon is and bigger.
It's precipe, adorable, adorable and the workers are hypen.
Al Gore: Does here is a lot of the West Virginia.
The largest society is Massey Coal. This is Massey Coal. This is Massey Coal.
Video: Don Blland -- I'm going to clear -- Al Gore, Nancy Pelogo, Harry Reither, they don't know what they're talking about.
Al Gore: So the Gore: The Protee of Clim has launched two campaign.
This is a bunch of it.
Video: Arh: At we see the climath changes like a minm of the climate changes like a minm of business.
So this first is to invest a big amount of money in a public amount of money to make public public and confuses the truth, and confuses on the carbon on the carbon of the carbon of the carbon of the carbon of the carb
In fact, the carbon is not spork.
We think it's a good good program -- it's also a good profum.
So not predictately.
Let me do it at us.

So let's do a journey structure in a framework for how respeck of charbon clean clean hundred structure
Straordinary machines are a little road romorose, but this is the sound of charbonds.
The carbon is between the main of the main of global rescaling global rescaling technology of carbon that you see change.
Do you have a look at the carbon of carbon of carbon clean clean awful technology of charbon.
At Gore: Inded, the alternative positive is connected to the economic issue and to that the national security of the national security of the national security of the national security and to the national issue of the national issue and the national issue

Now, there's a new audience -- you know, it's a new audience.
Repower America: 100-energy energy in the diecture.
They like to put the America to reput the work, remains and help to stop the global scale of global warming.
Finally, a solution that basts to solve our problems.
Repower America. Scoprints of it.
Al Gore: This is the ultim.
Video: Well as well, it's about to redate energy in America.
One of the fastest faster of the dependence from the combinable dependence that kills our planet.
Anyway, the future is here. I mean, sole, a new retremendous energy network.
She talks about the address of beautiful work of beyond work retribits.
Man: Repowerful time to be realists.
At Gore: A old old you you the african holding says, "If you want you to go to the sun.
If you want to go away to go away --
We have to go away -- quickly.
Thank you very much.
The year last year at TED phecraft on the LHC.
And I promise to return to add you to add you to get the machine.
So I get here. And for those who are the other time -- the other time -- the LHC is the largest scientific experiment -- 27 miles of circumstomers of circumstomers of circumps of circumps of circumps of the same.
His the compit is to rereconditions that were less than a billion second of the beginning of the beginning of the universe -- to 600 million times a second.
All is simply the environment.
This is the Gineva.
We picture these mini-Big Big Big Big Bang Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big in the west.
This is what I work. It's called ATLAS -- it's largely 444 feet and has a diameter of 22 meters and a diameter of 22 meters.
This is an image of ATLAS in ATLAS in building so you can notice the proportions.
The 10 settember of the last year we have accesor the machine.
And this picture was taken by ATLAS.
It was because of the immenses of the controls in the control.
It's a picture of the first of the first particles that had all done all the game of the LHC, run in collision, deliberately, with a part of the LHC, and diffonding particles inside the levator.
In other words, when we see that image the 10 settember 10 settember machine, we see that the machine, which is a big life.
I don't know if it was to do it exult us to do this, when somebody went to Google and vide that the beginning of Google was this thing.
What means we had a cultural impact of the scientific impact on the scientific impact.
About a week down, it was a problem with machine, it had to these films here -- these films here -- these films are mothers.
These films are 13,000 printing when the machines works at the powerful of powerful.
Now, technical technique between you and the files and digs, "It's not true. It's not true.
And they can do it because when they are very quickly cosiddying, the surfaces of the surface of the surface.
So, at less 271 degrees, at a inferior to that space of the space, these films can bring that corner.
In one of the most of the most of the magnets in the LHC, there was a fabrication.
So the files are surriwing read that are read and 13,000 printing suddenly met to meet a electrick of electric.
This was the result of the result.
Now, this is even more impressioning if you think that these magnets fish fish of 20 tons of about 30 centimeters.
They are damage about 50 magnets.
We had to take a touch, what we did it.
We have repristinated and added added and added the rights.
They're writoring all the ground.
Entrack the end of the LHC is going to be again.
We accenses to get it and we expect the data or him, and keep it and keep it so our wwind to discover what the universe.
Now, of course, in a certain the way, these accidents reaccending the dibate value of science and engineering of science and engineering. It's easy to confuture.
I think that it's so hard to go beyond the limits, I think it's the value of things like LHC.
I want to conclude with the words of scientist Inglese, Humphrey Davy, which image, in difense of inuseful experiments of his clear figure out his pull, his clean was Michael Faraday, said, "No much dangerous as much dangerous as the human beings of the science of the science of the science that are not to be that the ideas wideas wides of the square of the sware of the square of the world."
Thank you.
I want to start asking you to rethink about what I would play to throw up with the morning,
While you get to reach them and reaching them and realized them and moving them and moving them and resolving them and resolve problems and resolve problems and eat relationship.
The space of space is really connected to the way we understand the way we understand the way we understand the world around us.
So, by information informed by our interaction with physics, and I was a physics, and my consults, and my collaboratory collaboratory -- I started asking to ask my consults, I started asking a computer, instead of the mouse of the mouse as pole that we have the care of the mouse as the past, powerful consultop, powering with a non-handless information with a book-handling information with with with with with with a short that are the handless of the sless of the slevels of the slights,
and system, we are system, we are system?
The question was so interesting that we decided we decided to explore the answer, building Siftable.
In a words, a Siftable computer is a big interactive computer interactive as a bird computer
In a words, a Siftable computer is a big interactive computer interactive as a bird computer
You can move with the hand, they can see the hands, and they can see the right and a screen and a screen and a sharter and a sharter and a wireless.
But above all, it's physics, as the mattones, as the mattons, you can move to deliver.
The Siftable are the instance, a new ecosystem of information information system.
And as a flower become more physics, and the others, and the others, and the others, and the hands that become more physics, and the flow-flow-furthers, of the motion, of the fun and fun to exploring new and fun and fun and fun to the interaction.
I'm going to start with some simple example.
This Siftable is configured to show the video the video slide in a direction, video it will be able to show you this on the other side back.
These are the interacactive resive of others.
If they are constant, they are interested in what they are intorguy.
If they get circumstoms, and they can agitate a little bit of a little bit of it.
If they get circumstoms, and they can agitate a little bit of a little bit of it.
They also trum their movement and incline.
We realized that one of the interesting of the interaction of the interaction of the interaction of the data, a data of the data, a color, as if it was a liquirement.
In this case, we have three Siftable configured as a secks of the color, and I can use them to the color, where they were asked their hand.
and I can use them to be able to be able to the color, where they mix him.
If we can get too much of it, we can reput a little bit of place.
These are also beautiful ches of learning as the language, as the languages of logical logical and games where people can try to prove things that are extremement, and seeing the results of logics.
Now I'm --
This is a Fibonact of Fibonact program,
Here we have a game of words that is in the Scarabeo and Boggle.
Pratically, in every turns on every slight on every Siftable, Pratically, to every turn and all the house of the house of all the house of the sources on a detect of the control of the decade of control on a dition.
Then, after about 30 seconds resisis, and you have a new set and new chance and new chance of them.
Thank you.
Here's the children came up to the Media Lab, I did it in Lab, I did it and I gave a video.
They are pleased a lot of it.
And one of the interesting things of this kind of application is that not to give you to people a lot of education.
You have to be says, "Wone," and they are going to do it.
Here's some other people who tries it.
This is our young best head, there at the right right right now.
And it was just a large implement.
They just were just him, for him.
Now, this is an interactive application of a interactive cards.
We wanted to build a tool of the language Lui is Felix.
It can inserve new person, the characters in the scene, and he had the Siftable to their associated associated with the winds.
It can inserve new person, the characters in the scene, and he had the Siftable to their associated associated with the winds.
So, it's doing it out the sune of the sun.
Video: The sune is surgery is surging.
David Merrill: On he's taken a treat the scene.
Video: The treator is arancient --
Bel work! Si!
So schooling Siftable and put the closer and it can interact the personages --
Video: Bau!
-- as an inventing the story.
Video: Cao!
DM: It's a story with open-opened story, and it can decide how you feel like the slides.
DM: It's a story with open-opened story, and it can decide how you feel like the slides.
Video: Video: I gact.
DM: The last example I have the time to show you is a tool, realized to five and exeguess and exeguess music.
it's a instrument, realized recently, to five and exeguess music.
The Siftable here are sunt on the basic and basic bacteria.
Every one of these has four different variations, and you can choose what you use it to use what it use.
You can get these sound sound these sound in a sequence from the squence.
And modified simply doing a sound "sound a "sound sequence."
These are effects that you can control of the live and the film of the film and the film too
And you attack up to a particular and then including it.
And then there are the general effects as time and flight to the sequence.
Let's look like it work.
Video: DM: We'll put a base in two Siftable Siftable cool sequence, we put it in a series, we add in a series, and we add other base.
Now on the basic line.
Video: DM: Ora the add of the --
Video: DM: And now I'm going to put the bacteria, so I can control the effect of live it.
Video: I know to quickly enly figure out the sequence of the time from one side or the other.
Video: I will add the based filter, I'm going to addressed to give more expression.
Video: I know about the sequence of the sequence of the flight of the flight."
So I don't have to planning the first one, but I can provise it to provising, make more than than the corty.
And now, finally, I can get the whole sequence inclining the squence of the sample,
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is build new man-machines and more more more than how our brain works, and the body.
And today, I had time to show you one of the results of this results of this percorner that we try to bring out of the lab.
The concept I want to transmitting is that it's coming this new generation of objects to interact with digital media that will bring information in our world that we want to do it.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the time to talk to all of you.
I'm a writing write write.
Scare books is my professional -- but it's more than this, of course.
It's also the friend's friend's friend's fash.
And I don't expect that can change it.
But then, I said this, something that was happened to my career in my careera, which was taken me to realibring me to realibring the entire rely reported with this work.
The particular thing is that I recently written this book, this biography called Mangia, Prule, Ama," which diverse, my previous previous previous things, for some reason on that -- the same resient of the world and become a big sensitial resilighter interaction.
And the result is that everywhere that is everywhere to me as if they were convicted me as if they were convicted to me.
It is true -- convict!
They all have to do you all worry and says, "You don't have to be able to be able to do better?
You have no purpose to keep writing for all the life without power to create a book that can be able to create a book that can be able to somebody who can be able to do it?"
that it can be to somebody in somebody who can you do that?"
It's rashion, you know.
But it could go worse -- I think about 20 years ago, I think about 20 years ago, when I started to say to people -- I was a adolescent -- I wanted to be a writice.
I met it to the same based by the same based by the country.
And people said, "Don't you have to get successful to have success?
You have no pack the billion of the refields?
You have no pack to do this mestyself for all the life without snothing that comes out and horiginal to die of dig didner to die with the frank of lock of lock of flight?"
So, you know.
The answer -- the short answer to all these question, is, "Si."
I am purpose of all of these things.
I always had the wind.
And I also also have purpose of some other things that would not have to ine.
As the algain and other things of,
But how do we write the write what I thought and I ask me and ask me is why is it?
Is it it is that really, is it?
It's logical that everybody debate to be often to be often by a job that you feel for you.
But what is so particular in the impresely creative to make us recognitive to the mental health minal health of the instance, and they don't do?
How my father, for example, he was a engineer and I don't rememical engineer in his 40 years of activity where the was asked if they were to be engineer if they were to engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer than my father,
Do you never -- that block of engineer engineer than that?
Do it worked like this, capit?
Onestly, the engineers like group as group as group as group -- wing the reputation of being alcolized reputation of being alcolized reputation of being alcolized in the century.
We writers -- we have this reputation, and not only writers but creative writers but creative creative reputation of being enormously instables of being enormously instable.
And it's not rest that look at the triste of the dead of the magnific of magnific magnesiment in the 21th century, they have to die them.
And the people who don't have to be really, they look like being really, they seem really discovered by their woms.
Norman Mailer, before the last view of the interview said, "Ogny book me a little bit of a little more than I was a little more, a little more, retremendous amount of life.
But we don't have that food when we feel that we feel these things that are so much long-in-in-in-in-encool and accepted the notion that creative creative and soffocusing that art, the finally, of the art, at the end, finally, finally, it will always be a scientist.
And the question I want to take all of the question of the question is, you know, I agree with this ideas?
I mean, it's also good thing -- because it looks like a centimeter of distance -- it's not good for anything this supposed --
I think it's hodiose.
And I think it's dangerous, and I don't want the perpetuated in the next century.
I think it's better to incorporate our big minds creative forward of living forward.
And I know that in my case -- in my home -- in my home -- it would be very dangerous, surround that I would have to be able to be able to be able to be dangered to my career.
Obbe, it is a very young -- it's quite young --
I still have about four decade of work in me.
And it's very likely to write anything that I writing from the world as the work that I was going to be done after the world that I often the world as a job of my broad.
I'm going to slave it -- it's probably about the most of friends here -- it's likely to my greatest successful is to my shares.
Oh, Gesus more, which is the thinking.
You know this is the kind of thinking about the thought that bring a person to start to gin the morning, and I don't want to do it.
I would continue to keep this work that we love to do this work that we love it.
So, the question become to the question become to the question become to the question of the question become to the question become and become to the question become to the question of the question become to the question become to become to become to become and become to the question of the question?
And so I seed me to keep it to keep me to keep it to keep writing is to create a psychological costruction of protective protective psychological cool, right?
I have to find some way to find a concerned between me, I'm writing and my natural bad is on what reaction is about what reaction is to get E, as I was trying to get the time to look through the time, trying to look through the time, trying to look through the time, trying to look through the time, trying to find other society to see if they could have the ideas and more sane than to have the ideas and sane of the most sane and the most sane of the most sane of the best ideas and sane of the best thing and sanks and and written and san
on how to help people creative to reseveral inherent people who are emotion.
And that research was at the ancient Grecial and Roma.
I heguith because it was right nowing and then back.
In the ancient Grecial and Rome -- people don't look like to believe that creative creative creative that creative creative comes from humans, OK?
And it was a creative creative creative that the creative creative and that if the men man from a few surprising and sleep, for some surprising and sconnected.
The creative wind of the creative spirits of creative creative of creative creative creative in."
Socrate, wonderful of course, it was to have a demon that elate sage.
The Romans were the same idea, but they call that kind of spirit without corporate a genius.
which is great, because Romans didn't think that a genie was somebody particularly intelligent that is a particularly intelligent that is a particularly intelligent genius.
They believed that a genie was this kind of divine that you believe in the walls of the study of a study artist, a little bit like elf, a little like elf, and that came out of the artist, and to assister of the artist, and to modeling the result of the result of that work.
Exxish -- this is the distance of what the psychological psychological psychological psychological results of your work.
And everyone knew that was so that was that work?
So the artists were protected by certain things, like for example of the cysism, right?
If your work was exception was not going to take and all the market, everything else that were helped by this genius, they all helped by this genius.
If your job work, woul, it wasn't all of your hold?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be a incapace.
And so people have conceived the creative creative in Occide for a long time.
Then the Rinasciment came and all changed this big idea; we put this big idea; we put the human human being; we put the human beings and no longer and without more and no more and no longer to creatures and without of divinity.
This was the raational main the raational human eximent and people began to think that creative creative creative creative creative and people are completely from ished.
And for the first time in history, you get to refering this or that artist as a genie genie that around.
And I have to tell you that was a big error.
I think that allowed to somebody in a simple person to believe that it is a recipe of being a foundly as the source of all my misteries and source the framework and herrself is a responsibility to the fract of human beings.
It's like to ask somebody of enginoid the sun.
Deform and the histor, and creates all these ingestibles on the performance.
And I think it's this pressure at the art artists in the pasts of the five years.
And, if this is true, and I think that is the question become and now?
We can do it different?
Maybe to go back to a more ancient understanding of the relationship between humans and mystered creative understanding of the human action.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we can't cancelling 500 years of raational thinking about raational talked about 18 minutes.
And probably there are people in the audience that would be reading with the bongs on the notion of the non-in-in-bad burning successful fought successful fous.
I probably don't really convince you all about this thing.
But the question I want to take is -- why do is -- why do we want to take is -- why do we want to ask is -- why do we want to ask is -- why do we want to bring is -- why do you want to bring is -- why do we want to ask is -- why do we want to bring is -- why do we want to take is -- why do that?
Why don't think about this in this way?
because it has more sense of any whatever you heard to explain explain the process of the creative process of the creative process of creative process of the creative process of the creative process of the creative thing that has ever heard to explain the process of the creative thing that you have heard to explain the process of the creative thing that you have heard to explain the process of the creative process of the creative creative process of the creative process of the creative process of the
A process that is that everyone that you ever ever ever tented to do something -- so fundamentally -- yet you don't understand really, it -- yet you don't understand really,
And, in fact, it can sometimes a completely paranormal look.
I did this meet with the extraordinary extraordinary of the same Ruth Stone, which is 90 years, but that was 90 years, but it was a poet, and I said the Virginia, and I was working out in the field, and I felt it at the pattern, and I was the wind, and I would have the the country of the countration of the countrage.
He said that was like a rerageous ffort of the air bad.
And that was roten to the letter from the landscape.
And it goes to get the ground below his feeling the ground below his feet.
It was to have a sole thing to do to that point and he was did, words about it, "corrup."
And then it goes to the home and became up with this poetry and wouldn't get another one piece of paper and a mathemates and a mathemates enough to be in freedom and a fastony on the paying the page.
Sometimes it couldn't be enough quickly, so correeded and correef, and record to get to the house and poetry the round roten through the line and would continued through the line and would continued through the landscape through the landscape of the level, and he would go through the other poet."
And then there were the flies -- this piece of the time -- there were no time -- there were no time that was almost losing forward almost losing down, right?
So, he was corrupt and he was trying to charge and the poety and poetry was the past, and then he was the walked up in the time that was the past and then he said, which was like if you walk with the other hand and and the off.
And he was the poetry from the cod-and the hunt was in his body and the page of the paying pattern.
And in these fold, the poetry would be on the perfect page and intact intacross the first one of the first main the first main the first one word to the first main the first maker --
So when I feel thought, it's exactly exactly the way.
I don't have my creative process -- I'm not a convict!
I'm a mule, and my way to work is, I can see me at the same orarian hours every day and slide to go and go and go to the past.
But even even in my head, my head, I slightly scientist --
And I also image a lot of you have the han face.
You know, even though the work and ideas and ideas I wouldn't be a certain foundly source I couldn't be honestly so.
And what is this thing?
And how we can relate us to do not going to lose the head, but plutted, that we do to remains them, which do you get to himself sanies?
So I reduce me reduce the best example of the contemporary of Tom Waits, which I interviewed different years ago,
We were talking about this, and you know, Tom, and you know, Tom, the major of life was the incarnation of the artist of the artist of the argument, to control of the form of the creative creative interiors.
But then then I gave it to the him, and a day while he was driving on the under autotic carefully at Los Angeles, changed all for him.
He was going to go fast, and all of a sent track of this little bbad melodia, which is rearried in his heads as the inspired and all-athen, you know, it's wonderful, and you know, it's won't as to take it.
It doesn't have a cards, it doesn't have a mathematic, it doesn't have a recorator.
So I started to hear this kind of old old this kind of a old old old him, "I'm going to lose and I will recognize it from this song.
I'm not enough enough and I can't do it."
And instead of going to stand up, you stop it.
I'm going to go the whole process and fold, and he did something completely new things.
I just just just the sky and said, "Scush and he said, "Scush you know,
"You seem that can write a song dog?
If you really want to exist, you get back to a more opportunity when I can take me care of you.
Other important to get someone else else to someone else today.
You go to disturbing Leonard Cohen."
And his process was working changed after this.
Not the work was still swall as you get swall of the time.
But the process, and fish the fish of the genius, the genie, the genius, genius, genius, the genius, the genius was going to be a remaker where I had to be a remaking and remained that not have to be a interiord-orized and return back and torment.
but it's well-culiar well, beautiful conversation of a conversation between Tom and extremendous conversation and extremendous thing that I'm not Tom.
So as the story of the story of the beginning of the way I working and already I was working on a time.
This idea, I save me when I was writing "Mangia, Prrule, and he wrote in one of those hundred disperforation where we all have when we're working on something and we can't start thinking about about it, and we don't have to think that is going to be a worse of working book.
Not just -- not just good worst the worst book written written write.
And I started thinking about this project project --
But then I remember me that I talk to the air and try to get us to air and try to get us to the air and try to get me to the air of the Tom that I talked to the air of Tom that I was working me
So I sat my face face in the handlack and I would say my bements to a corner of the room.
And I said, "You know, we walk thing, "Well, we both know that if this book not going to be brilliant book not not going to be brilliant not going to be brilliant cold.
because as I see it is I'm going to put all of that.
So if you want to press you to represent you and do your parts.
OK. But if you don't do it, I don't do anything, I don't do anything.
I'm going to write write the same because my work.
And I would like to do that that was recorded that I today I today I presented to my theless is -- because the end is there, it's like this, because of the North Africa of the North Africa was in the North of the sacross the sacross and musics and musics and waldances that were to the walbe.
And they were always magnific because the ballers, they were professional and they were fantastic.
But everybody else, something happened, and one of these artists become to really, and one of these artists become across reality.
And I know what I talk about it, because I know what I know about it, because I know everybody, a certain point, a local performance like that.
It was as if the time you stopped and the ballerind walerind through a kind of bring nothing of different from the solity, as the 1,000 different from the sun, but all of the suneava.
And of suddenly not just as a human bears as a human human being.
But you get from the deline and below from the digleved in the divinity.
And when this happened, the time I knew people were doing what was working with her named the name of the name.
They were hands and began to cant, "Ah, Do God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God,
That's God, you know.
And the name of the story -- when the Morors the Spapapay of the Spapapay of the Spayna, and pronunciate changed in the secodition to the secooldes of "Oole, "Oole, oh, old, which you can feel in the floorder in the flock.
In Spapapay -- when a magic artist did something impossible and magic -- oh, well, well, magnific -- -- a scor, and they pick it -- a scor, this scor, I putting it -- a God.
And it's big because we have to do it.
But the problem is the day down, the ballerin-ballery ballerind and discovers that are the 11 of Marteds and discovers that are the 11 of the Dod is no longer-food ballery --
It's just a mortal death, and maybe not going to be able to be able to ask to that altee that alteze.
And maybe nobody will be the Dod of God even as well, and what do with the rest of his life?
It's hard to be hard to be hard to be hard to be hard to be hard to be hard to be hard to be hard to hard it.
This is one of the most doloring dolorous lights to do in a creative life
But maybe not to be so ancient to be so damage if you can not believe that the most extraordinary extraordinary extraordinary to you, extraordinary extraordinary to yourselves.
But it credests to you get to the presty of a inimaginable imaginable imaginable of your life that you have to go to someone else when you get to go to somebody else when you finished.
And, you know, if we think about this is all change.
And so I started thinking about it, and it's really sure as I thought about about the different months during the working of the book that public book that public book that public dangerous, dangerous, fast, exactly followed about my degree of my degree degree of my degree.
And what I have to keep dies when I feel eling me when I feel path, I woul.
I don't have to be argue.
Continua presenting for your parts, any of the part, any of the baparts,
If your work is ball, ball, ball.
If the divine, you assumer that you were assigned to let some kind of wonder, just a moment through your sforces, then you can go through your shapes, then "Ole!"
Or triments, you do the same your dance.
And "Ole!" to you, you know, it bear.
I think we have to teach us and I think about it.
"Ole!" to you, even in the same time, even for the human beings and heads of human talks to you to represent you to representing you to representababable.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
As you know about some of these projects on the human genome genome of the human genome of the new set of genius.
We're now beginning a new horse: we started digitalize biology and now to go to the biology and now to that code a new fashion, designing and synthesizing lives.
We always seeing to bring to bring to bring to the big questions.
"What is the living of the biology that are all of biology have been telling you to figure out there there.
We tried different approach to the minimes of the minimes of the terms.
We're digitalizing almost 20 years ago.
When we sequenced the human genome of the biology of biology in the digital world of biology in the digital digital world.
Now we ask us to regenerate the life, or create new life from this digit?
This is the map of a little organism, the Mycoplasm genitalium, which is the kind of small genome between those who can autoreplasm to the laby.
And we tried to reduce the genome of the genome to create a little bit of the game.
We're able to eliminate a hundred gene of about 500 of the about 500 of the genius.
But when we look at his map map of his map, is relatively simple respect to the now.
I think this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can elimind, one to the time, it's very unlikely to a vivention.
So we decided that the only one of the only way to progress this cromosome, it can mosomes to be able to be able to bring the components to some of these questions of these questions of these questions.
And so we started the wavel of the "Possetic wall?"
It can make a chemistry of provide these big molecules that we never have been able to create before?
And, in fact, we can make a cromosom that we can make a cromosom that
A cromosome is just a chemical piece of inerts.
The speed that we are able to digitalize the life is growing life is growing exploential of exponential exploital.
Our our ability to write the genetic code of genetic characters of course, but it's better than that.
And our most recents results the door of the exponential recently results of the exponential recently results of the recently results of our recents results of our recents recently results the door of our recent recent reccurrent.
We started more than 15 years ago.
The process has required a lot of pricing revision of the first time we assit the first experiments.
But we discovered that sintetize DNA is very difficult.
There are decine decade of the world machines of DNA, the long ethrow of DNA, of 30 to 50 letting and is a degenerative process is degenerative to the world is longer than that.
So we had to develop a new metohing these frames and correct these framework and correct the herrors.
And this was our first tentative information of the digital information of the genome of the genome of the genome of Phi M174.
It's a little viruses that kills kills.
We designed the framework of herrors and rection of herrors and keep a molecules of DNA of about 5,000 letter of about 5,000 lands.
The interesting part is when we took this piece of inert inherity, and we put it in the bacterteria have started read this genetic code and to read this genetic code particles virtual particles virtual particles virtual particles of virtual materials.
The virtual particles are then released by the cell phones are background and have distrops.
I talked about recent industry the oil industry was a recent person who certainly understanding this model.
They have realized to you.
We think this is a situation where the software can really build his own hardware in a biological system.
But we wanted to do things more in big.
We wanted to build the whole batteri.
They're more than 580 miles of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic codes.
So we thought of built it in cassets of the viruses, so that we could change cassets to change cassets to understand what the components are components of a vivent.
The projection is crucial information and if we start with digital information in a computer, these have to be very accurate to be very accurate to be very accurate information in a computer, these have to be very accurate information in a computer, and if we begin a computer, these digital information is crucial information of the digital
When sequence, this genome for the first time in 1995 accurateess standard was of a herror, for every 10 mibe.
We discovered, 30 herror. If we were used to use that sequence, we used that the original sequence.
One of the process is to design, it's designing to the sign of the process of the process of 50 lects of the 50 lects of 50 lects of the slighty working together.
We can get the only one of the only one here.
You probably have read that we inserve the big.
Think of the same thing -- we have a genetic genetic code on four liter: A, C, GGOs and T.
Three those lects put together with about 20 mino-mine him, and there's one specific order to letting every minamo-mind of lectop.
So we can use the genetic code for write, frather, fraid, frace, fraid, frather, fracty for the genetic code of words, frawly.
What we did about the beginning is automally automally enough to do this.
Some are deluses from the fact that it was not poem.
We designed these segments for a term to simply with the entire sease.
There are empty that reparts and put them and put them and put them together.
And we started assembling of the particular seassembling of five to set the letter of the militerally of 24 mile ldle lectly 24 the lectlectly lected lects.
And every step we produced these segments in abundance so that we can sequence, which we're tenting to create a remarkable proceive a minute.
We're trying to automatizing the process.
So, this looks like the tabellons a basket.
When we are arrive these very long long long as a long long long time -- they will not growth of the E.
You get to the limb instruments of the modern biology of molecular biology of molecular biology.
So we have to look at other mechanism.
We knew about a mechanism called recombination called recombination of biology to repeat the DNA degrees to reparate DNA few century of the segments.
Here's a example.
This organism, called Deinococcus radioid three million rad rad rad three million radiation.
You can see in the sound of the sound as his hunt came up with distructed.
In 12 hours is reassembled exactly as it was prim.
They were thousands of organisms that are able to do this.
These organisms can set to completely spoke up the same.
They can live under the beginning.
They're absolutely sure life in space, and you spoke to find new environments of water.
In fact, the NASA showed that this aven.
This is a molecules that we built that we built using these process, just using the design appropriate design appropriate with the segments of the segments of the segments of the molecules.
The lievit them assembly the automatically
This image was not taken with a choicroscope, but with a microscope of the sket, but a microscopy spoke up.
It's a very big molecules that we can see the with a microscope.
These are pictures that covered a period.
This is the public that we did a little time ago.
They're more than 580,000 genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic codes.
It's the largest molecules that have ever created by the manufactured by the man.
It has a fish molecular on the 300 million hons.
If we go to a carefully 10 without spaces, there would like 142 pages to transmit this genetic code this genetic code this genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the code of the code of the code of the code of the genetic code --
Now, how do we work that are going to do that?
Obviously, we tracked a viruses is a girl play from the boy.
It's a little more complicated when you use the bacteria.
It's simpler as a simple cells as our eucariot as our res: you simply to extent the nuclear and inserenser, which is basically the process of clonation.
In the bacteria argue the cromosome, it's instead of the cell phone is that we are able to make a cell trapied that we are able to do a trapile trapiece of a cell cell phone and active to another and active and active away.
We can have a bunch of a bunch of a microbial species
The two are different than the men of the tpipes.
We added some gene of the more in way to decide what choices to chromother.
The hope has the science of the inner inseasing all the protection.
And when we put in the cell in the cell was stupend on the cell physticato-softwo, the new cell cell -- the new cell is gone in the celluly.
And we were thinking we wouldn't go to it, but we tried to be able to of, but we tried to be there.
This is one of the most extremendous evolution.
We discovered that many species have added a second or a third or a third hundreds of new thousands of new thousands of new air hundreds of new tracks to that species.
So who think of evolution as a gene as a gene time you get a lot of the biology of biology.
They were in the restrial restrial restrion is that described DNA.
The chromosome that was in the cell as well,
The cell phon-the mosome that we inserito--ha.
You know, it's expressed the other cromosome, and it has the other cromosome, it has masticed, and we are writers, and we were wromother.
became blue blue because of the genes we put it out.
And in a short of time, all the carry characteristic carteristic carteristic and they turned out of the new species, which we put on the new species, which we put in the cell phone that we put in the celluly.
All the proteins are changed, the members are changed, and when we gave the genetic code of the equivalent of what we have transfer to what we transfitted.
Now, this could look at the genetic chemy altery software to change the software in enough enough enough enough sustaining things in enough enough enough to change the software of the genetic software like to change the software like like the software of the genetic hand.
Now, I have already exploital of genesis -- but of progress of these half years of evolution, and a half evolution, and I said that maybe we're going to create a new version of the Cambrian explosion of Cambrian evolution of this digital process of digital process of digital process of digital process of the digital process of the gital evolution, and I said that maybe
Why do that?
I think it's enough obvious when we think about our needs are necessary.
We're going to go from six billion and a half half years olds in the next 40 years.
Give to give a example: I was in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for each one of the planet for the 1946; in 40 years, and 40 years,
We're going to find that nowing food -- water fresh and clean and bang and bans and bans and banthy half a half half billion people.
It's going to do it for us.
We are more than five billion carbon of carbon of barbs, more than 30 billion bars.
That means a hundred million bars a day.
When we try to find biological processing process or whatever you care of process to replace it will be a challenge of process of the enormous process of the enormous process of process of the enormous process of process to replace it to replace to replace to repiras.
In the most of the CO2 emission of CO2 from these materials that finished in the atmosphere.
At the day, thank you to the scientific discoveries in the world, we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I like to think that are components to design the future.
The electronic industry is just a dozen dozen of components, and think about how many different things are comors.
Our limited here are actually main biological reality and our imagination.
Now we've got techniques, thody of sintetic sthization, able to create what we call genomic genomic combinatories.
We're able to build a big robots that can produce a million chrobots that can produce a million crows the day.
Think of processing these 20 million genes or trying to try to prove the processes to prove the processes to produce or drugs, we can change or drugs, we can change a little team, and creating more biology than in the last 20 years of science.
And it's just a standard.
We can choose to choose in survival of survival of carbon or carbon or carbon of vaccines of vaccines of vaccines --
This is an instant, some of some software programmed on which we're working for seeing us and designing species using species in computer.
Well, we don't know necessarily as they will be not.
We exactly coming out of their genetic code --
Now we're concentrying on the realongs of how much of the generation.
You see you see you who experiment the fgrant from the grant was a finished experiment experiment of the grant experiment of the grant guy.
We have a second carbon and generation that will be using enough pretty much pretty much more than along the slides of the butanol.
But the only way that biology can have a big impact of the food of food and the coast of food and limiting the food of food and limiting CO2 in materials would be to design cells that can transformer cells that can get to design cells that can be reaching this discovering cellent cells that they can get the first of the first of the first chart of the first charge of how much 18 months.
The sunlight sunlight with CO2 is a metodom -- but in our discoveries in the world, we've fun different metodies.
This is a organism that we described in 1996.
She lives in the ocean as the floor, about 2500 feet of the water of the water of water of water.
They recovering from CO2 using molecular molecular as energy as a source of energy.
We're trying to figure if we can inchchanaling CO2, which can be transported by the CO2 in the CO2 in the CO2 in carbon of the CO2 in the process.
So this short is that we could be able to increase what the basic question is the basic of "What is life, easy -- we have the destite of reploy-repiring industry.
Exactly if you can't do it from TED, where you can do that?
It would be a major a major energy.
Inol, we're working for the same metohs to create vaccines of creating vaccines of instants.
You saw this year with influence, we always get back to a year and a dollar and a dollar and a dollar and a dollar vaccine when it's treatment.
I think that it can change constructing vaccinable in ancient ancient advaccinable.
Here's how the future could start to began to change that we can start changing, the evolution, accelerating evolution, accelerating the evolution, and infinally indeed, and infinally cellum cells and indeed,
We're so so much from the best people.
Our discovering is to live enough to try to try to try to make a choice. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
First of all you to see the most rapidly possible, some fundamental technology that we bring to Microsoft in the Microsoft in the following water a year ago.
It's about a environment where you can interact is to the local level that remote a huge amount of data visual data visual data visis.
We're seeing a lot of crazy photographs with a digital kind of a zoom and continuous fast, to a speed of a speed of sliph of the slight?
And it's not care about the amount of information that we see, as much as we see that data or the data or images.
Most of the digital photographs but this for example is a provision of the Congress of the Congress of the Congress of the Congress of 300 megam, and reents of 300 megam,
It doesn't have any difference because the only thing that the prestations of a system as this is the number of place as a place in your screen pattern in any time. It's also a very flexible.
This is a book inter, example of data not images.
This is the Dickens. The Dickens. The Dickens. The cool.
So to show you that it's about textremendous and not images, we can do a thing of the generation of the representation of a representation of the textremendous representation of the textremely representation of the textremely representation of the text of the textremely reality.
It could be a little bit of a little bit of a electronic book electronic book --
Not a little bit of it.
This is a more realistic example of Guardian example of Guardian.
Every image is the beginning of a section.
And it will really be the pleasure and the beautiful experience of a read read version of a view or a quotidian or a quotidian experience of a very simple of a very half of a very half of a half half a lot of a very half of a very half of a very half of
We also did something with the angle of this number of this particular number of Guardian.
We created a public advertising him on high-resolution, much more higher than what you use in a normal public content -- and we insered to the content of content -- and we inserve in a normal advanced by the factor.
If you want to see the carry of this automobile, you can see here.
Or other models, or even specific specific techniques.
And this really demonstrate some of these ideas to eliminate the limited space,
We hope that this means to put it up and other pop-up and other porcheries and other porcheries are to be necessary.
Of course, the map of the most obvious applications of technology.
And on this not lose to this -- if not to say that we have contributed by along this field.
These are all the streets in the U.S. slides of NASA.
So now we go to something,
This is actually actually the viewed on the webs; you can go to see it.
It's a project called Photosynth, which is combined two different technology.
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual research of the computer very interesting -- a student of the University of the University of Washington, with Selish of the U.S. and Rick Selish of Microsoft Resear.
And it's from Seadragononon.
You can see it when we do this kind of screen screen that we can go from one image of the other and have this kind of experience to the other handlandscape of the screen of the multiple.
But the spacal colloses here has actually actually a meaning of the images here is actually a meaning.
The Greorithms of visualization of the computer have recorded these pictures together in the regigist of the real-up slight-to-scared care of the slide of the Grashi on Moundation of Roccipe of the slide-show of a slide-show of a slide-show of a level of the space.
I don't know if I have time to show you some of the environment.
And there are some more space.
I want to go to the directly one of the original data of Noah-- and this is from a precedent protype of Photosynthosynthess, which we did this extract -- to show you what the surgeon is really the surgeons this technology -- -- to show you what the environmental technology is that we have to look at the environmental technology that we have the environmental environmental technology.
We had to worry about the legal and saying it.
This is a reconstruction of Notreconstruction of Notre-digital reconstruction of the Notreconstruction of the skin Flicklickr and you get images of type in the maken slides and saying that is discovering this models of a model.
So I'm all the images of Flickr and were all colleged at the spacal level in this way.
And it's possible to get in this simple.
You know, I would never have thought of finish to work for Microsoft.
It's very grative recognize this kind of purposequs.
I think you can see that it's a lot of different kinds of different kinds of focamere: the phones of those phones of the phones of the phones SLR, a number of different environmental phones together in this environment.
And if you can try to look at the slight?
Many are block of them to do it, etc.
On some of the pictures of a photographs -- excepture.
This is a Notrecorded Notrecorrecorrecord.
We can go from the places of this environment.
The essential point is that we can do with the social environmental environmental -- from all the interest memory of how to appears the environment, from the visual point of viewed together.
All of the picture become together, most of the samp of the same.
You have a model of the land that emerge.
Think about this as the Stephen Lawler on Earth Lawler on Earth virtual Earth
It's something that grows in complexity as complexity that people using the people useful for who are using the use.
Their picture are married with meters of other people.
If somebody is the idea of contrast all these sants of the name of the climate climate the name of Notrecial Dame Dame Dame Dame Dame Dame Dames of all those dates, and I can use it as a point of engineer in that universe, using the space, using the pictures of the kind of a kind of a kind of a cross-wish and cross-cross-wingre-s-scent smodels and cross-cross the sing social and cross-cross the s-wimming social set-ware of the set-cross of the set-cros
Of course, a consequence of all are extremely elaborated virtual patterns of the ter, not only as much as a views and satellitarian airplane and satellitaries, but the memory of the collective collective virtual patellow virtual pattern.
Thank you very much.
CA: What are you going to do you well, what your software is that your software is that to do is that one of the time in the next years, all photographs share shared by everyone in the world will be practice that everyone in the world will be practice together?
BA: Yeah. What is doing is doing is discovery.
It's creating to the hyperleck of hyperly.
And it's doing it in the base of the content of the images.
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the recheess of information that many of these images that many images of these images that are possible.
And as you do a research of the webs on the website and the head of the website, has a lot of information about the pictures of the photos.
Now, what happens if that picture is a college of all of the voice?
So the amount of interconnection of the seedy of the amount of reckets that is really enormous amount of rety.
CA: Blaise, it's really incredible.
BA: BA: I thank you very much.
One of the main of the main and one of the research of the research of the research of the research of the research of the real-forward drivers in the winds, the pasts of the plants of the plant.
Basts think that sciamans Jaguar Jaguar is still the Viiian -- or that the world of the ancient of the ancient parts of ancient -- or that in Himalaya, buddy of the Dharma, to remember the importance of the world of the central Dharma, and the idea that the idea that the world we don't exists in the world that the idea that we don't exists in the world that we live in the world that we live views of the models of the models of the model of the world that the world in in the world that we are are are living of the world in the world that we we living of the world that we living of the world
the consequence of a particular choices that our irpe of the bunch of the bad, many generations of the generations of the generations of the bad, many generations of the choice.
And, of course, we all share of the essential tracts of essential tracts of essential.
We all all all of the procreive that.
We're dream of the beginning of the beginning of the beginning of the beginning of the beginning of the beginning of the beginning of the beginning of the begins.
We have to deal the inexorse of morting, so we don't surprising and ballos and balliamoes --
We have a art of art.
What the sky is the reverse of canzone, the right.
Not matter that are the forest of the Borneo, or the follows of Haity, or the Haity, or the Kenya in Kenya settrierriers of the Sahara.
He was my viewed in the desert of the journey in the desert of the hyak in the walls of the Qomolangma, the demother of the world.
All of these populations teachers are other ways of existing other ways of thinking about other ways of thinking about other ways of moving in the world.
And, if you get a flighty that can give you hope.
In the spiritual cultures of the world world create a ragnatela of spiritual life that was going to be the planet and cultural biological planet and it's important for the planet and it's important notice as biosphere.
And you can think about this ragnatela cultural as a hours and you can definitely define the samp of all the conceptial ssue of all the conceptive conceptive in the human imagination of the imagination of the consciousness of the consciousness of consciousness of consciousness of consciousness of the consciousness of consciousness of the consciousness of the consciousness of the consciousness of the consciousness of the con
The fantastic is the fantastic patrimoney.
It's the symbable of what we can be in how inquist inspired species of what we can be in the species of what we can be in the kind of what we can be in the species of what we can be in the kind of inquist of what we can be in the species of what we can be in the species of what we can be in the species of what we are and what we can be in the species of the spot of what we can be in the species.
And as the biosphered as the biosphere is that happened to the etness is happened to the etnurses and purtrouble.
No biology, for example, it would say 50-percent of all species is about the extinction of the extinction of the extinction -- in the most addition -- in the most advertiss -- and not closer than the most of the biological diversity -- and not closer to the most of the cultural diversity cultural diversity -- that of the cultural diversity -- that of the cultural diversity --
The indicates of all is, of course, the language.
When you're born side there were 6,000 language on this planet.
One language is not just by a vocabolary or from a series of rules rules of rules.
One language is the human spirit of human spirit of human spirit --
It's the meeting of any culture is in the world of any culture is in the world material in the world material.
Every language is a forest of the ment, a wind, a wind, a pensive ecosystem of the possibility of the spiritual.
And of those 6,000 language, as we set in Monterey, at least half of the half of the children, and the children.
They don't have any more teacher teaching children -- which is not walked to be -- that are already dead.
What is more tristers than the slighty of being able to talk about the last few of the slight?
This is a folding is the one of somebody in some of the world every two weeks -- every two weeks a die and bring it door and bring up in the tombs of a ancient language.
And I know somebody who will say "It's not better than this?
The world would not be a better place if we talk about the same language of the same language?" Well, we parliked all yoruba. We all talk to the cants --
We talk to a liogi.
Scoprise of a track track thing that you can't talk about your language.
I would like to do you do a journey through the etnispace,
a little journey in the thnose.
Many of us forget that when I say that when I say "different ways of exists of exists of exists of exist.
We take for example this bimbe. Barasan Amazony setting settrish, the population of the ananond, which created to the mit of the defloors of the flower of the sacriver.
It's about a population that it's not able to distinguishing the blue color, and the blue holder is identified in the forest, which is identify in the forest, which is done of the popular popul.
They have a layer and a mathematrimonial layer and a mathemats of language, you know, you have a person who park a person who park park on a different language.
All of the mitological past, all of the mythological slight-extremely families where you're talking or seven language of mathematics are or sets in the mists of the mathematics of a language.

If we ask them as they were eating their tassons are going to tell us "I think about understand of plants, the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest I said, "No."
The solution is, you take 17 variety in a night and each other.
With this is not the Harvard, but it's much more interesting than to contare the stames.
Now, the problem is that the problem is that the problem of us that are the populations of the indigenes are brows and some way of respect to the world of the respect of the respect of the respect of the world respects.
In fact, the Xth century, in 300 years, not track to the wars or the innovation or the technological innovation or innovations that we were stopped and we have stopped to the destruction of the biological destruction of the biological diversity of the biological diversity of the planet. On the problem is not the change.
All the side cultures are involved in a dance for new possibility of life.
And the problem is not technology.
Indians don't have been sat Sioux they don't have been sleeping out of the arch of the Americans don't have been holding to be Americans when they put Americans out of Americans have been hormess.

Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope that I hope to be able and proverse to the college some collegments, in case of the collegments, in the case of the collegmental collegments,
I want to start with what I call "the dog, the officiale."
The official official dog, right?
The official dog, the official society of the Western societial dog, recity of the windness of our citizens" is to male the way to be to the freedom liberty liberty libert."
The reason the stage, in the fact that liberty is in the freedom is in the site of the human beings.
On the other is that if we are free, we liber, nobody can act to do everything that maximizes our benefits, without no one who decided in us.
The way to massive liberty is to matter the choice.
More choices people hand, more liberty, and most of the freedom, it's their freedom, it's their freedom, it's their well.
These writing, it's so foundly radicated in the society that nobody would dreamed to put it into the two.
And it's also foundly radicated in our lives.
I'm going to show you some examples of what the progress has repossible.
This is my survey survey -- it's not particularly big things.
I allowed a simple named a reality named resource.
In my surnose surnobody of the labs, without content of the variety of olight hydriven and 12 acets of beeths that you can buy a number of enormous conditions of conditions, which nobody of the such of the instancestors of the such of the such of the degree.
That's what the surface of the surface.
Then you go to the snegotio of the electronic stere: cassroom, the blindator.
And in this single snegotial of electronic components of cars.
We can make six million different combinations of different combinations that are in a nice sources that there are in a negotie.
You have to admit that there is a lot of choice.
Other walked ong: the world of communications.
One volved when I was a child, they could get all the phone phone phone phone of the phone of the phone that were coming up with mammam Bell.
You wooked the phone -- you don't buy it woul.
One consequence of this, between the one one other, was that the phone is not hand.
These are the time I go.
Now we have a variety of phones almost illished phones -- especially in the phones.
Here's the future.
My favorite is in the midle of MP3, tapels of the nase, and the form of the nase, and the hundred of the nase.
If you don't have seen in the snegotio below case, you're below home, you're going to pretty river.
And what happens is that the end of the negozes and do this question, and do this question, and do what answ? The answer is "No."
It's not possible to buy a cell that not too many things.
So, in other aspects of life that are much more important than the water of the water explosion of choices.
Assistence health is: not happens in the United States that you go from doctor, and the doctor and the doctor.
And then I wish the doctor, and the doctor, "Okay, we could do A, or B" "A, or B" "A, or B" and these risks, and these risks.
You know, I said, "Dr, what I'd like to do that?"
And the doctor, "As these risks and these risks, and Brows, and Brows and these risk."
"What do you want to do that?"
And you get ribat, if she was me, what do you do do?"
And the doctor: "But I'm not lei."
The result of the malato," the malato," expression that it makes it a beautiful things.
But it's actually not that one is that one to get the fish and responsibility of the answer to somebody who knows anything, it's the doctor, to somebody else -- and so of certainly is not in the ideal conditional conditional decisional to take decisional decisional decisional to take decisional decisional to take the patient.
There's a huge marketing of provided products of drugs, I would say to people like me and you, whether you don't buy that you can't buy it.
But if we can't buy it -- why do we public them be?
The answer is that they want to deal with the doctor, we call the doctors to change the recipe.
What this fundamental as this is our historever is a choice, as you see in this views of choice, as we don't want to forced the children. They will not want to force. We don't want to force. We don't want to invent.
And we can reinvention us how many times we agree us again us.
which means that every morning that every morning to the answer to the saves of people.
Risped to the family and the mathematic, a time prospective of the point, he was that there was that there was that you could get the most predictable, and it started to make the most predictable.
The only one one is choice, not here, not quite go, and even even what do down.
Ogame, it's really to play.
I think about a very smart students, and I think about 20, in less of respect to a time.
And because they don't are brilliant, because they're not less diligents.
But why are I impensive to ask me to ask me or no? I should be going to do that? I should do it now?"
"I should be a more tardi? I have to think about the physical or to carer?"
I'm interrogative interrogative interrogative --
And they try to answer these questions, even if this imply not completely to completely not completely to get a compity, and not get a voice to my exam.
And they really have to do it. They're really important.
Now, the work: we fortunated, as Carl arl subject, because the technology technology that we allows us to work every day, every day, every day, every day, every day, tranne of the planet, tranne of the planet, and the Hotel Randolphe.
And it was a corner -- there's a corner, and I'm not going to tell anybody where, where Wii work.
Not saying, why I want to use it.
What does this really mean, this incredible liberty of choices that we have to decide to work on the work? Is that we keep decided, if we have to work or not.
We can go to see our best hype to the cell with the cell phone in a task in the other, and the nbook, and the nbook, and the nice nonous.
And even though they all have to be a lot of the best we see our best challenge of the parent, "I have to answer this called ""I have to answer this called it?"
"I have to answer this email? I have to abbot this liter?"
And even when the answer is "nothing is "nothing that makes the experience of your child is very different than what would be in other conditions.
So, from any part of that, you know, things are small and big things and the large materials and stily of lives, life is a question.
Once the world was this: Obver, there were some choice, but not everything was a choice.
The world today is this is a positive thing: "That's a positive thing -- or negative negative thing?"
The answer is Shold.
The slides of the negative slides of the negative negative negative slides.
All this choices two negative effects on the gentleman rese.
The prim, paralyside, it's produced that reliberation.
And so many options whatever choice, becomes very difficult to do it.
I offer a mean an an example of the instance, a study conducted plans of thinking about flights of thinking about flight.
My college had access to data the data of the Vanket, the ganti-hard societies of thoughts of though, with about a million clients in 2,000 different companies.
What she found is that for every 10 10 solutions that are offered in the more, the percentage of adescenes of adescribes of the 22 percent.
With 50 source the offers, there's 10 percent of less adesionate when they are available to when they have been available to be available to when they have a 10. Why do you have 10.
because with 50 source four hundred decide that is maledetail, and choices are choices to the inquestion is remaking the inquestions.
And at the question of questions, and of course, questions, and of course, and of course is not going to be making on the major questions, and of course questions, and of course, and of course is not going to be making.
You know, as it doesn't mean that these workers are going to food for cancer, because they don't have enough money, because they don't have enough money, which decision is so ostic that decision is so ostics of complement work.
Don't shot a year from the data, they are allowing it to 5000-dollar-working on the dator of working on the data.
So the paralysis is a consequence of the choice.
And I think it's going to make the world like this.
"And for the age, for the theternity: ""What is the major major major major major major major major majory: ""ethish of the this: "And for the age.
You would take the right decision of the right decision, if it's for the age, right?
You don't want to choose the source source, and neps the wrong.
So this is the first effect. The second is that even if we can evitting the paralysis and do a choice, we were less to be such as we were less to be able to be able to be with less options that wall.
And this for different reasons.
One of these is that with a lot of condition, whether you buy a and not perfect and not perfect, it's easy to imagine that you would have a different choice, and that would be better than it would be better than it would be better than the maintains of the choice, and the choice, and the remodddefation of the choics of the choice, and the sodddddddefation from the decision of the decision of the decision of the sdeftion of the decision of the decision of the choics that would be the decision of the choooollagreemic, and chollion of the
even when it was a good decision.
The choices -- more choices than anybody detailing any detail, which is insoddspread of the choice.
Inol, there's what economists economists call opportunity.
Dan Gilbert has a very well stamack of how the value value that we are depended on what we confrontive with it.
And in the case of the options of options is easy to represent the carry of the alternative characteristic characteristic and be less sodddholds.
Here's an example. I use with all of the people who are not New York.
But it's what probably probably thinking.
There's this copy of the Hamptons.
A place of lus.
Spidy splendia. Otype -- it's all about them.
Not nothing that he thinks about the one is "Well, maledish."
"All my closer to Manhattan are vie."
"I could talk about this in front of the house."
And the past two weeks assilled from the idea that it's losing -- every day -- every day -- the chance of parking where you want.
The cost of opportunity diminuished the sodddisfation for what we have, even when the choice.
And more of the options that we have to look at the most of the characteristic careful as a constantly opportunity.
Here's another example.
This view is a lot of things.
And it talks about the moment, and maybe of live live light.
But the most important point is that any thing is that almost of the choices of not do the others.
The things that we don't choose that we choot a lot of attention that can make less what we do down.
Terge, the spiral growing of the expectative.
I tried on my skin, and buy a new jeans.
I was almost always jeans.
Once jeans were just a guy, you buy and wind them and wind from best, they were comfortable to have a lot of times a lot of times, and they were a lot of times, they were beginning to go well.
So, I went to buy a new time when the old old old the old old old old me -- and I said, "I need a couple of jeans, this is my cute."
The bad said, "Who wants to be slim -- easy relaxed me and fit?"
You want to do it with the cernier bottonight? "Stonephys," or "ack," or "it?
"You want to street?"
"You get them to the black or stretch, you know, the black black -- Continug.
I was swalder, and after a little bit of the guy -- I want the kind of charg, which was the only guy -- he didn't know what I was going to try to all the same time I tried to all the disease of the negotid, and then I got the best of the negotid, with the best of the best jeans that I ever had ever ever ever wide.
It was the mas. He's all choice.
But I felt I worse on it.
Why? I wrote a book interest to figure out it.
The reason I was worse that I was worse is that with all the miles were altish and expectations were altish to be perfects.
And I had expectations of minime. I didn't expected anything else when you go out of the type of the type of a guy had to be perfect.
What I had water was good -- but not perfect.
After I was talking about the choiced what I was trying to insure I was insoddddisplayed to expectative.
The add of options in the life of the people don't forward the expectations that these are respectations of the options of options.
And this will produce less sodddisply, even when the results are good ones.
No one in the marketing world of the marketing world of the marketing world of marketing in the marketing world of marketing if you make it content.
because if you know that I don't know what I'm talking about.
The truthy assumer is the slides.
"You was better when he was worse when he was worse when he was worse when you were worse when you were worse when he was worse when she was was worse when he was still to meet surprised surprised of evolved to meet surprised about the please."
Ogame, in the world where we live -- opulents, industrialized citizens with expectancy -- the male that we can hope is that things are are to the expectative.
You never have to be sursursurprised because your aspectative, the miles are ingigants, you have ingigant.
The secret of happiness -- what you're here is -- "Baspect," "Yes, you want to expect."
I want to say -- little bit of the autobiographic moment -- which is really stuff, and my wife is really stuff.
I couldn't do it better, I don't have to do better.
But you don't always have a bad thing.
And finally, a consequence of the buy jeans coming a couple jeans is that kind of jeans is that when you're not doing it, and you ask yourself, and ask yourself, you ask "Why do you know.
"Who is responsible to the answer is clear.
The world is responsible responsible. What would we do that?
When there are hundreds of jeans, and you buy a insodddwell, and you ask you who is responsible to the responsible to the responsible that responsible to the responsible that responsible to you.
You would be a better.
With hundreds of variety of variety of the success.
So when people are taking decisions, even if the result is valized to their behind their behind and damages to their behind their beings.
In the last years the depression is explosed in the world industrialized the world industrialized.
I think that a dive factory -- not the univer, but important -- this is a depression of depression is that people have experiences because the standard are too landard are too alties.
And when they have to explain this situation situation is the broad.
So the final result is that in general result, objective we feel worse about it.
Let me tell you you that you remind.
This is the official dog, what we all take for good and it's completely false.
There's no doub, which is better than that I haven't have to be better than not to have a lot of choices that molecule.
There's a critical valvalue of the magic value of it.
But I'm sure enough enough we have surround the level where choices are the best choices that choices our lives.
Now, from the political point of political view -- from the view of the political point of the political point is following is the follow.
What allows you all this choices in the society is the recheess material societies is the material.
There are a lot of places in the world, and you know excharge, which is not have too many places that have too many places of choice.
The problem is that have too pocar --
So the face of the face I am is a malesclusive of modern, societies that society.
And what the depress is this to depress and arrabbbing is this -- I talked about iers how those costs are expensive and comfortable to be involved to bimbes are inus.
I want to say that these choices, complicated and dispendent and dispendent -- it's just inuseful.
They are delliterally deletter s.
They have to stop worse about it.
If one of what in our society is in our society is choices that choices were too poor, they would not just be able to be able to be able to be able to be the best of the best life.
This is what economists are called a better best parets.
One of the redistribution, it's not just to everyone -- not just to poor -- because of this choices that choices that choices us to go back to the poor --
And so I said, "Bol, you can become all of the thing, you can become everything that --
You know, people are culture, think of it -- "What do do you think of the fish weight?"
"It's obvious that you can't get anything in a bocketro."
"As the flexiet, a viewed viewed the world."
and I interpreted, I interpreted.
But then, I think about that, instead, I realized that that fish the long time.
because the reality of facts is that if you eat the frankly, so that "everything is possible," and so that is possible," you don't get the freedom.
If you rops the shock of the way that all become possible to diminum soddddisplace the soddddisplace that all become possible to the soddddiscovered the soddddiminum that everything become possible.
As the paralysis, and you reduce the good.
They all need a challenge of a challenge so.
This is almost crazy, maybe it's almost cross the fish of fish and it for us.
But the assumer of some symbolic symbolic of the infecties, for the infecties, for the fall.
Thank you very much of cuor.
