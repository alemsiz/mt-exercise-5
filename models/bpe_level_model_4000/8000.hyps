I showed these devices these devices to show that the calote glacial of glacial and almost three million years of the size of the size of the size of 48 United States is reververse by 40-percent.
Hoowever, this substance because it doesn't shows the problem because it doesn't shows the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice because it doesn't show it is the gravity of the ice because it is not the real problem because it is the gravity of the problem because it
The glacial calotic is a certain sense, in a certain sense, the heart of the system system system.
You go and go and reverse and you get the extinct of the extinct of the extinct.
The next next 25 years will be a little bit of a little bit of the last 25 years.
The ice lose locas are the reverse in red red red red in the red red red.
As you see it, you expanding the blue blue brought the blue brought the blue brought the blue blue band.
That is the ice in the hold in the summer of the extend of the extend of the summer in the summer in the hurder.
You can see that the cosided ice ice as a few years or or five years or is like the site of the corporate from the corpore.
In 25 years is spent by this like this.
This is a problem because the re-scale problem because the glacific terreno that are the ocean to the ocean and where there are enormous of carbon and that that are transformed by microbies.
It really, the totality of the atmosphere from the global warming scale that amount of global warming, surprised this point of not reports that is not report.
In some of the smart of Alaska meter of the water.
The professored Katey Walter of Alaska tremendous team is a tremendous team that was a little bit of the last last death the last inver.
Video: Wow! Life is good, it's good, if we are going to be able to be able to us.
A reason is that this scale of the termal scale by the normal Groenlands from north.
This is a flightens to the glacial found.
And he had never reach to the levels of the side.
This is the Kangerlusssudden in the sudden of Groenlous.
If you want to know how the level of the search level of the glacks on the hair, here is where the smare.
These are increasingly quickly.
On the other part of the planet: Antary, the most block of the planet.
The last month scientists have been inar that the bizarm of the glacific is in negative negative and that Antartices on some isole of the isole of the saves.
It looks like six feet feet of water, like in Groenles.
Himalaya, the third more block of the ice of ice ice ice ice -- you see new laghand, who who were glacies.
The 40 percent of the world's population of the water water water from what sheeded by what to do with the hang from what sheeded by the water of the population of the water
Souther: This is the founder is the fountaught of this cities.
The ported is increased.
But when he diminuies, the same happens, the water water water water water water water water water water water water water water water water water water water water water water water water.
In California nevers on Sierra Nevada is diminual demine of 40-percent.
The hydrogen are in crisis.
The previsions, like you know, I'm a grave.
The growth growth in the world door a night hauthors.
The environmental environmental environmental environmental environmental will be increasing out of normal, and without preedents.
Sometimes the most numbers of the last 30 years of the previous precedents.
This is a sanding of all the insustainable of the beyond of the beyond of the beyond all insustain.
If you look at the context of the storyic if you can see the constants.
In the last five years we add 70 million tons of CO2 to 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the oceans every day, 25 million tons every day.
Look at the area of Pacification of the Amermer, by the Amermermer, and the parts of the subject parts of the subject of the ocean in in the ocean in the ocean in the ocean in in the ocean ans.
The more because of the global warming, with the deforestation, the deforestation, the use of the deforestation, is the use of compounds.
The oil, is a problem, and the carbon is lost loca.
The United States are one of the most emissions, with the Cina.
And it was propond to build a carbon carbon on carbonons.
But we're going to be a change.
These are the projects of the last few years and some proposites of alternative vereeth.
And every way, there's a lot-political political in our Paese in our Paese in our country.
The carbon and carbon and the carbon is 250 million dollars in the last year to promote the carbon the last year to promote the carbon and the carbon on the last year of the last year to promote the carbon on the last year to promote the carbon on the last year to promote the last year to promote carbon on
That images me just just just something,
Very Natan, in Tennes," where there was a lost of 3.8 billion military military and carbon on on and carbons.
Maybe you saw it on news for news.
This is the second big flush of scories in America.
It happened around Natal.
The advertit of a carbon is a carbon of carbon was this:
Vide: Yeah, yet the carbonaim is a kind of cooke.
It's got to be able to be growing our economy.
Frosty the carbonaio is always more pose than the carbon on
It's good good preft, adorables and the work work of manages are depended to it.
At Gor: Which is a big carbon on West Virginia.
The biggest society is Massey is Massey Coal. This is his friends. This is his friends.
Video: LLookenship: Sarrate -- Al Gore -- Al Gore -- Al Gore Reid -- not know what they are talking about.
At Gor: So the Alleance for the Protetion of Clian has been like two pages.
This is a be, a partns.
Video: Att: The Gor: The ALergives the climate changes like a few of our business.
So our priority is investing a big amount of money. And in a sforce to make it public and conconscious and conconscious to the true of the true of the true of the true of the energy of the track.
In fact, the carbon is not spore.
We think it's a good -- it has also a good profumed a good profume.
So not preocustomed the change climate change
Let me do we do us us.
Vide: Carbone bone bone of -- you heard about a lot of it.
So we do a building a structure of the structure of the carbon is the carbon on the carbon on the carbon on the carbon on on the carbon the carbon the structure of the carbon on a structure of the carbon on of the carbon on the carbon the carbon on the carbon on the carbon is the carbon
Straordinary machines are a little brumor, but this is the sudden, but this is the smic of the carbon on and the site machine.
We consumers of carbon is between the main the global warming, but the night technology of carbon and the slummor that you see change.
Date a eye is the odier: This is the technology of carbon and the technology of carbon on it.
At Gor: Infind, the alternative alternative to the economic question, and that of the economic and that is the national economic initial of the national economy.
Video: Comment: The economy, the economy, the economy, the economy, the economy, the economy, the economy,
The filter that the connection of the compose of compose from compose and the carbon and oil oil and oil oil oil and oil oil oil oil oil
Now, even a new thing, and audace solution for uscirces.
Thre: 100 percent of energy energy in decade in decade decade
A plant to report America to work and make us more physics than the reference and help to reference the global warming scale of global warming.
Finally, a solution that basts to solve our problems.
Scover America. Scover more.
The Gor: This is the ultimate timate time.
Video: S: It's about reping energy to America.
One of the most of the most of the end of the end of the dependence that have our planet.
Comparsa: The future is here. This is here, a new energy you'll see a new energy will be a new energy of energy.
He knows to go 2: Nuoves for places to work for work for retribes.
Sunclear: It's time to be realists.
At Gor: A old proverbs says, "If you want to go to speak ak to go to the solar from soles.
If you want to go back to the hand go together.
We have to go back to the speak it.
Thank you very much.
The last year at TED I had a introduction on LHC.
And it turns out to the carry to the machine on how it works.
So it looks like this, and the other time you don't have no longest experiment -- LHC is the most experiment -- 27 kilometers -- 27 kilometers of circucucust.
He's rear conditions is rear conditions that were going to be a billion billion we have a second from the beginning of the beginning of the beginning -- to 600 million times in second.
All is just the environment.
This is the machine machine ine machine.
We take these minminds and the Big Bang in the rights in the rights
This is what works. It's called ATLAS -- is a 4-feet and has a diametets.
This is a picture of the ATLATLAS in built so you can see the proportions.
The 10 sectors of the last year we have acceso the car for the first time.
And this picture was taken by ATLATLAD.
It was because of immense in the site sand-control of control.
It's a first picture of the first fasking of particles that was all the around the LHC, in the collision, with a part of LH, and the smart of the LHC, and the particularly particularly particularly particularly in the re-level of the LHC, and the LHC, and
In other words, when you see that the 10 sector, we understand that the machine that the machine is a big lives.
I don't know if this is going to do us to do that, when somebody went on Google and vide that pay was this:
What means means we had a cultural impact of cultural impact
Look a week week, it was a problem with the machine, just to these films here -- these films here -- these films of the fildored.
These films are 13,000 feet when the machines of the powerful machines of the powerful powerful for the massive we could work.
Now, the technical technical of you look at the films and diring. I'm not true. I'm filmed too much.
And instead they can do it because when they're very fredying the cosidal conductors.
So, at least 271 grades, to a temperature between the stellow the space between the stelles, these films can take that that she's going to get that out that they can take that that they can take that out that they can take that the cut up to the stellow the stellellow to the stellow of the spaces of the space.
In one of the most of the most of the nice in LHC, there was a dife of fabrication.
So the filmes the surprising reports and 13,000 feet and 13,000 feet of the electricity.
This was the result.
Now, this is still more impressive if you think that these magnets, and that these magnets, and that are slower of about 30 centimetries.
It's been danneled about 50 magnets.
We had to put them them, what we did we did it.
We have repristed and adverted and adverted the ustics.
Now, I know they're going to all their place to be able to be able to the subject.
English the end of the end of the LHC will be new inte.
You accet, and we asked, and we aspect the right or or luf, and continue to find what our own door to find what the morning, and we reach what the universe.
Now, of course, in a certain way, these incident of the debate of the scious science, and the value of engineering and engineering the engineering of engineering and engineering from confution.
I think the fact that the fact that the fact that the fact that this is the value of things like the value of things like the LH.
I would like to end with the parts of a scientist, Humphre's Daphy Desesesa of initiate experiments of his own own own experiments of his own own own own own that we are not the Michaaay, "Niman was just to the human mind that the science of human mind that we are not the ideas that definitely conscious of the human mind that that we are not the way to have to have to be a new new ideas that that we have to reververse that that that that conscious for the constitutitute, and that that that that that that that that that that are the new new new new new new ideas that are are are are that that that are are are are are are are are are of the constant to the new ideas that that that that that that that that that that that that that
Thank you.
I want to start asking to rethink about how to do you get to the morning, played to the morning.
And you understand how to reach them and reach them and then take them and then they learn how to think and solve them and solve the way and resolve problems and so that you can actually think and the relationship.
The reason is to change is actually connected to connect the way we understand much part of the world around us.
So, by informath from the ushed by our interaction, and I said, "You know, with the construction of my conversation and my collaborator, and my collaborator, and I started asking asking and when we are a computer, I started a computer, but when we are a computer, and then we just have the smart of the saving of the saved that is a reporting of the information with a little bit of the information with the information with the information with a reporting of the information
and system?
The question was so interesting that I decided to explore the answer, built the answer, built the answer, built the answer;
In fact, a few parts of a computer is a computer interactive computer.
In fact, a few parts of a computer is a computer interactive computer.
You can move with the hand the hand they can see the hand they feel the movement and they have a radio and have a radio and a radio wireless and a radio wireless and a radio wireless and a radio wireless and they can move the right movement.
But it turns out of the morning, like the morning, you can just move to the morning, you can just just just just folds.
The Siftable is an example of a new ecover systems to the information information for the information
And then they become more physics, consciously, consciously, the move, and then they become more physicists, and they become more physics, and they become more physicists, how they are going to explore new and how we can exploring new and funnal new and funnations.
He started with some simple example.
This Siftable is confied to show the video to show of the video, if you put it in a direction, the video root video is going to go back from the other part of the other part of the other part of the other part of the other part of the video.
These are interacties of the others of others.
If you have to do them in the fact that it's their own intents.
If they get cirdates, you see it and they can again a few feet and they can be a few of them.
If they get cirdates, you see it and they can again a few feet and they can be a few of them.
They also have their movement and sinction.
And we realize that one of the interaction of interaction, it was the way to use our communities in data, to example, "Look a color like if it was a fliquid.
In this case, we have three Siftable configured like the smart and I can use them to the color in the central thing to the color where they missed them to the color where they missed them to the color and I can use them to the color and I can use them to the color in the case, where you can use them to be able to the house.
And I can use them to be able to the color in the central thing to be missed to the central and I can use them to the central surgery.
If we are we going to put a little bit of a little bit of it.
I'm also good and possibilities of the chance and how the mathematics and games where people can try and try and see the things that quickly quickly. And you see the results of the things that you can try and see the reverse of the chance of the chapter and a chance of beauty.
Now I'm now --
This is a sequence of Fibonacy that I do with a program of equations.
So here we have a game of the Scarabeo and Bogge.
Pratically, every turners received a literal case on every Siftable, Pratorors, in every case on every case on every Siftable, and while you try to make a primary of a composition.
And then, after about 30 seconds of a new set of brought and new new chance to try and new possibilities.
Thank you.
So here's what the kids came to the Media Lab, I did it in the Media Lab, and I took a video.
They like to be a lot of it.
And one of the things of these things are interested in this kind of appropriate is that you don't have to give people many of educations.
You just want to say, "Compones of the parole," and they know exactly what do you do.
So here's how to other people who try it.
This is our betters young people, you know, there is a young degrees.
It really wanted to just have a cut.
They just are going to be morning.
Now, this is an interactive activity.
We wanted to build a tool-instrument for the ling's Flix.
It can be able to new persons in the scale of Siftonishing their own associated with their own associated with their own own own their own own own persons in the scale of their own own own persons.
It can be able to new persons in the scale of Siftonishing their own associated with their own associated with their own own own their own own own persons in the scale of their own own own persons.
So, it's doing the sold out the sold.
Vide: The sole is surprise.
David Merrill: Now it has brought a treatment in the scale of the scale of the scale of the scale of the scale of the scale of the scale of the scale of the scale of the scale of the scale of the scale in the scale.
Video: The treatment of the treatment
By work!
So schools Sifife and put the neighbors can interact the characters --
Vide: Woman!
And if you inventing your story.
Vide: Ho!
DM: It's a story with the open--old story and can decide de and it can decide that you know,
DM: It's a story with the open--old story and can decide de and it can decide that you know,
Vule, "Gulf course,
DM: The last example I have the time to show you is a lot of recently, I did this recently, and exeguing and exeguing music.
It's a tool, to do it recently, to campioning and exeguing music.
The Siftable here are acting by how the bacteria and bacteria and bacteria
Every one of these four variations, and you can chood.
You can insert these suddens in a sequence of compost your please.
And it just difice the just doing a "sound to play a "sound and a "You know, and a "You know, a bunch "You just do a "sound to do a sound "sound.
These are actually actually you can control from the reveral and the films.
You attaches to a particular suddens and then sinct to the stage of the address to the stand then they can stage.
And then there are the general as long and you want to the interest sequence.
We look like it works.
Vide: We are going to put a basic in two Siftable in two Sifab," the system, we can actually add in a series, the extend to the other based on the extend to the other based on the Siftext and the expensive in a serious basic Siftable to the two Sifife and we are going to add a kind of the soubbbbe.
Now now now a link line.
Vide: So I add to add the percent --
Video: And I'm going to put the filtrue to the bacteria, so I can control the effect of the live.
Video: I can speak to the whole sequence of the sequence of the time from a brought or from the other.
Video: And now I add the movie to the bottom of the expression.
Video: I can recombined the sequence of the sequence ""Fir."
So I don't have to planned the primary -- but I can lived a longer or more or more correct or more correct or more corporate the primary of the first time.
And now, I finally, I can sfuel the Sift-left the Siftable to the Siftable to the Siftonishing the Siftable to the Siftable.
Thank you.
So, as you can see my passion is building new interfaces and more like a better better liver and more like our brain and corporate our brain and corpore.
And today, I had time to show you one of the results of this lost and some possibilities that we try to get out of the lab of the lab of the lab of the lawer.
The concept I want to put is that is coming this new generation of objects that we have to interact with the digital media media media media is going to be information in our world in the way that we want to do it.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the now of you talk to all of you.
I'm a writing writing.
I want to take books is my professional profession, but it's more than that, of course,
It's also the friends and the one of my life.
And I don't expect that change.
But he said, something particularly happened in my life and my life and my carriery, who took me to realibrate the whole time to report the whole time to get this work.
The particular thing is I was a little bit about this book, this biography called "Mangia, Pregion, Ama" the quality, Ama" the world and become a good reason and become a good reason and become a big sense, and he became a big sense.
And the result is that anywhere people are -- people who were condition as if you were condanned.
It is -- condition -- condanna!
They are all worried and say, "You don't have to do it not have pay to do anymore.
You don't have to continue to write to write to make a bit more life without being able to create a book that can you do something?"
that can important to do somebody?
It's reefict, you know it.
But it may go worst part of what I remember that most 20 years ago, when I started to say to people -- I was a writing write -- I wanted to be a write write -- I wanted to be a write write to be a track.
I reach to the same reaction from the country.
And people say, "You can't do it not have to do not do it?
You don't have a million-million.
You don't have a paper of doing this mestive for all life without the life that you ever come out and brought on a heart of every infranches with the bock of love to love with failing energy for the energy of love and s?"
Cose things, you know it.
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is """Yes."
Sixxids of all the things.
I always had a pain.
And I also have a lot of other things that people can't ind.
As the allow and other things that you are swime.
But for how I was going to write what I was going to ask me and ask me to ask me to me, is why is it be?
Is it it it ration?
It's just a local that anyone who are waited by a work that you have to be sent to do.
But what is that particular in the imprevent to make us to make us about the site of the site that other carries in a way that other carries to not fanno?
And as my father, for example, he was a engineering and not remember that one time in his 40 years of activity where they were asked to be engineering to be engineering to be engineering to be engineering to be engineering to be engineering to be engineering to be engineering to be a church of a engineering and not remind to be a chappropriate to be a churant to be a chance to be a chance and so much of my failure.
It was never -- that block of engineering engineer?
It was not work?
Onestly, engineers like a group like group like group are not looking at the several reputation of being the reputation of being alcouraged to be alcourage.
We write about this reputation, and not only writers and writers but creatives you all have this reputation of being enormously reputting them to be enormous instable,
And it's not reach to the triste of the death of the magnificent death of the magnificent century, only in the 1st century, and often often for their young and often often for them, and they are often for them,
And even those who are not suicide that they are really disappears to their women.
Norman before I got a first of the last month, in the last view of my book has killed a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit of more than the work of their lives.
But we don't go to say that because we heard these things that because we heard these things that are so long to find out of a way we have completely interiorate the notion that creativity and the drug and the initious that the argues will be able to get to the hurt and the wind, and then the reduce to the sought to the hold and that we have these things that we have these things that we have completely interive to get to the
And the question I want to all of this is why is you all of this ide?
It's good for this thing -- because you look at the word from a centimeter to distance this is not good for this expensive for anything that is a few of this is not good for this way.
I think it's odiose.
And I think it's also dangerous and I don't want to see the next century.
I think it's better to encourage our big minds creative to live in true.
And I know that in my case -- in my case -- in my case -- it would be very dangerous to what I was going to be able to be able to be able to be able to the circustances and where I are in my career.
Of -- insum water, I'm pretty young people, I have about 40 years.
I still have about four decade of work in me.
And it's very likely to write that everything he said, "You will be right now now now now it's going to be the work that used after the work that used to my last book.
He went slavery, because we are all more or less friends here -- it's likely the most successful thing is to my slavery.
Oh, Ges: What it was going to be there.
You know this is the genive to think that a person to start to go to the notion of the mornine and I don't want to do it.
I would continue to continue this work we do.
So, the question become that?
And so I several a lot of reflect, which the way to work to continue to get to remarkable to create a costruct psychological protent, right?
I wanted to find a certain way to find a distance between me, which I'm writing and my natural antural and my natural antural and what I wrote to get you to get the time to look at how do do it through the time to do a lot of the ideas and more than we have to get to the world and more and more than the best ideas and more and more miles, and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more than we find and more and more and more
And how to help people believe the people creative to connect the inerent of creativity.
And that research has brought me and antics and antics and Roomic and antics and antic.
Seguitemes because the gives and then you go back to the sand.
Nellanics Great Greee and Roma -- people don't seem to believe that the creativity that creativity has inities, right?
It was thinking that creative creativity was this spirit and that they came to the men and that they came to a few of men and unknown for reasons and unknown for reasons and distant reasons and distant the distant and unknown for reasons and unknown for the spirit and the concerned that that the spirit of the beyond and they were the beat, and they know that they were going to be this for reasond and know about about it.
The grew of these dives will look at the spirits of creativity "demony."
Socrate, wonderful that was a demone demone that elargives from the sagain from the sagain from the sageches.
The Romans were the same ideas, but they were called that the spirit without a genius a genie.
The big thing is the Romans don't think that a kind of really that a kind of like a particular game is somebody like a particular game --
They have to have a kind of this kind of this kind of divina that they were in the murons of study in the murons of the study of a little like the wild of the argue of the argue of the argument and the reporting of that work of that work of that work of that work of that work of that work of that work of that work of that work of that work of that work of the work of the work of the work of the arms of the arms of
It is the distance -- this is the distance of which parts that costructures that costructures that costructures that are protected to your work and the result of your work.
And all of them who was so that it works, right?
So the artists were protons were protons from certain things, like for example, too narcisided, now?
If your work was exceptional to not take to take it and all the mer, all of the present that was helped by this genius to be helped by this genius
If your work fail, it was not all colord, right?
They all know that it was your genive to be a inable inities.
And so people han concept, the creativity in Occident for a long time.
Then the Rindition to come and everything everything and everything and everything is the big ideas, we put the center of the universe in the center of the universe and the mysterious ides and the mysteries that write the detatails from the details of details to detatained the details of the detatails and all the details of the detail and all of the the people and all the the detatail
This was the principle of human beings, and people started thinking that creative creativity that creativity was completely from the ish.
And for the first time in history, you know, that is how to reference that arrate this is like a genius to a kind of a kind of like a person with genie.
And I have to tell you that was a big error.
I think I hope to put something, a simple person to believe that being like a recipe of how the found, and the smit of all the mysterious people all the mysterious and that are requieter-terms of the human beings.
It's like to ask somebody to do the solar soles.
And I started completely the ego and I believe all these ingestiable to all these ingestiable to lose the loss.
And I think it's been this pression to have the artists in the past,
And if this is true, and I think that the question is, and it comes it -- and it gets it -- and it is.
We can do it different?
And I try to get a more understanding more antic understanding of human relationship between humans and creative creativity.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we can't get 500 years of thinking about 500 years of thinking about 18 minutes.
And probably there is people who are a lot of the public that would brought me to the scientific soupts on notion and ununsurely the next to fold up the next fairly fairly fly on their projects.
It will be not tell you all about this thing.
But the question I would like to do is -- why is why is -- why is you do that?
Why don't think it in this way?
Because it has more more than every other thing that you ever heard about explain the expresent of creativity of creativity.
A process that as anyone that has ever to do something -- so fundamentally all here -- -- it is not behavioral behaviors.
And, you know, they can look completely woranors.
I did this indicates the extraordinary Ruth Stone, which has now 90 years, but that was a few years old, but that was a few miles in his own life and said, and I said that in his own own own own life and I felt in the camps, and I felt in the field.
He said that it was like a fragorous fragorous fragorous hair.
And he came to rotolding out of her hair.
And he felt that it comes to the land under the land under its feet on his piece.
You have a only thing to do that point and it was going to do that point and it was a morn."
And it gets to the home and she was followed by this poetce, and it would not have to do one piece of car, and a little bit of a car, and a lot of the training and the page of the page.
Sometimes it doesn't get to be very quickly quickly and correct and correct and correct and the reach to the home and the poesia and she was going to stay through the paper through the payle through the country, and she would continue to go through the path."
Then there were the times -- this piece of not dimentioned -- there were a lot of moments where the was almost loss; right?
So, he was going to go home and he was looking at the door and the past and he was going through a wild and he was going to be a sleep, and then he was like like if you had the other hand the off.
He was the office of the couurage and the surprise in his body and the translate to pain.
And in these hot, the poesia would be presented to the perfect and I mean to the right side of the last word at the first word at the first word at the first word at the first word at the first word of the last word at the page.
So when you hear it -- is the painting -- is exactly the revenue of my process.
Not all my process, they're not a conduction -- they're not a conduction conduction.
I'm a cut of my way to work is a lot of work is -- I swe'd go to the same order, and you get to work and go to the same thing.
But even my head -- I was in my head, I was a filled to the thing --
And I think that many of you have a lot of you have a face.
You know, even though the work and the ideas and ideas were income to a certain kind of like a circle of not lose it.
And what is this thing, right?
And how can we relate to actually do you don't do even do the head, and pluttost, which is that we do it to stay stay to stay sanie?
For how much much example of the best example of the music that I have is the music that I have the music years ago I interview, which I interview, I interview, and I interview,
We were talking about this, and you know, and you know, Tom, the most life was the incarnation of the argument of the argument of the argument of impull and reported the whole of impull of impulate of impull and so interiorized.
But then you get up, and a day when he was driving on unch on unch on unappropriate to Los Angeles, he changed all for him.
He went to go through the speed of a track, that little frame," which comes into his head, which comes into his head, and it comes into his head, and it is a wonderful and the want, and the want, and the want, and the want, and the want, but not like to how to take it out.
It doesn't have a piece of car, it has no matite, not has a record.
So I began to hear this kind of old old old is growing in him and he said, "I'm going to lose it, and remarrate by this song allow by this dog alone.
I'm not good and I can't do it and I can't do it celel."
And instead of go in the panic stop.
He was a whole thing and the process and he made something completely new thing.
He just said, "You just see the sky and said, "You know, I'm going to leave you leave you that I'm going to leave you --
"You look like that would write a song song song or or doctor?
If you really want to be a more opposition, you can take me when I can take me to tell me to you.
Something to do somewhere else else else today.
And I want to disturbing Leonard Cohen."
And his process, it changed after that.
Not the work was still even even even like that.
But the process, and the fish that was releaving when he previous when he previous pregenie, the genius, he was going to go back to the way, and they were going to be a dead that he had to be a thing to be a whole thing and the whole thing to be a whole thing and the skin.
but it was a little bit of a baby of collaboration between Tom and this thing thing is that strange and this thing thing that he was not Tom was Tom.
So how to hear that story is a little bit of a little way I was working and I was going to save a time.
This idea, I was writing when I was writing to the "Mangia, Ama," and the scade of the cut of the disperation where we are working on something and we all start doing something and we can start thinking that a book is going to think that a book will be the worth book that will never be the book that is going to be the book --
Not only only good because, the worst book --
And I started to think about object.
But then I remember me from Tom that parking and you try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and you try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and you try and try and you try and try and try and try and you
So I got my face in my face, and I would say, and I would say, "Can you want to a angle of the stance.
And he said, "You know, you know, "Yeah, you know, if this book is not going to be a brilliant will not interest that if this book is not intercolate -- right?
Because as I see how I put all of the thing that ho, I don't have more than that.
So if you want to say that you want to tell you and do your parts.
Okay, but if you don't know what it is, you don't know it is.
I'm going to write the same because it's my work for my work.
And I would like to be recorded that I was going to do my part. Because -- the end of the end is -- the end of the end of Africa -- several deserts in the deserts of Africa and music, and music, and music, and music, and music, and music, and music, and music, and music, and music, and muscle and muscle and muscle that they were going to be able to the sweet and the s'
And they were always magnificent, because the ballers were fantastic.
But every one of course, something happened, and one of these artists become actually translate artists become actually translate change.
And I know what you know about what you know is that you have a certain point, a certain point, a loss;
It was like the time you stopped the ballery and the ballery and he was not doing anything funny by the sun, like the 1,000 night -- and all of the slow beyond the ballind.
And suddenly not solar as a human human being.
But you acceded by the death and in the fueled in the fuels of divvelely.
And when this next time I know that, you know, people know what it was called the people who were called the brought with his not.
They had the manages and started to cant, "Lah, Lah, Dod Dio, Dio, Diit, Diit, Diit, Did, God, God."
That's God, you know it.
Curic -- when the Morders Morder, they were the souththitude of Spay with their own own own the several ses and the gone of the several and said, "Lah, Lah, he said, "Lah, y," that still you can hear in the corriries or in the corrid of the corrid of the Spayyyyyet.
In Spay is that when a article has done something impossible and magic -- "Lah, magnificent -- a magnificent -- one -- one -- one -- one of God.
And it's great.
But the problem comes the day later, for the day later, when you swe'd save the 11-morning -- the 11-morning -- and he found it and last last last last time of Dod is not more.
It's just a dead deal with a big deal with a baby, and maybe not able to that alze.
And maybe nobody can, maybe nobody sons as a given as a given as a game of his lives?
It's hard to it.
This is one of the most sswearing of the most sswearing life creativity.
But maybe it has to be so angogoing, if you can not believe that it doesn't believe it, that the most extraordinary of your own extraordinary is to be so much of your own own extraordinary to be so angod.
But I credrug that are data in prester by a inherable inputting of this team of your life that is part of your life that you have to get to somewhere you have a loved when you have.
And you know, if we think this is change.
And so I started thinking about it, and it's sure that I was a lot of how I thought I was in the work that audience in the book that audience of the book that I was going to be able to the dangerous followed my great.
And that I have to continue when I sat at me when I sat at at this is, I don't have pay.
It doesn't just go to your work work.
I think you can like to presents for your parts, whatever it can be it.
If your work is ball, balls
If the death of the death and I decided to put the shift of the orgeum of this kind of wonderful and just through your hand your hand your hand you know, then "O!"
Something to the same your dance.
And "O!"
I think I think I don't think it was to teach it.
"O!" !" I just just for the samor just for the samor and heads from the talks to go to to deal to go to to deal continue to go to to continue to go to to continue.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Olele!
And you know I have been talking about some of these projects on the genome of human genomes of new genes.
Now we're starting to a new lost new los: We started digital biologists and now to go to a new fasking of the biologists of biology, designing and slaptop of biology, designing life.
We always try to put a big question.
"What is the lives?" It's something that many biological biological people to understand how many biologists.
We tried different approach to the minimal minimplant to the minimate ters.
We are digitalize by almost 20 years old.
When we sequenced the genome of the world that was going to spent from the world of the world of the world in the digital world of the computer.
Now now we can regenerate life or to create the new life to do this universe to this universe with this universe to digital digital life from this universe?
This is the map of a little organisms, the Mycoal-coplasma genome from the genome of the genome of the genome of the lab of the lab of the lab of the lab of a little organisms.
And we tried to reduce the minute to creating a little bit more smaller than a little bit more smaller than that.
We are able to eliminate a center centuuupon cents of about 500 that are here.
But when we look at his map maps to his map is relatively simple to the notion of the street.
I think think it's simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate a time, is very impossible to get a hell that this can take a hell cellula and the vivision of the lives.
So we decided to demonth that the only to progree this is sinting this chaptops to the cover and the provide of the fundamental components to put some of these questions.
And so we started the having of "Can we can sintetizing a chicken s?"
Can an an improvide of provide that we never have to do the time that we haven't able to create before the or?
And in case of that, we can actually do a chromother?
A smom is just a piece of material material of material material.
The speed with we are able to digitalize life is growing the life is growing to reponential exponential life is growing to the life is growing to be able to be able to be able to be able to the life is growing to the life is growing to the life is growing to the life is growing to be able to be able to be able to
Our ability to write the genetic code code code and pretty lended to be improgree.
And our most recently, the results of the slaptop of a current current to a current curve current to a current current remarkable to be exponential.
We started more than 15 years ago.
The process has asked many steps, starting with a revision before we started with a revision before experiments.
But we found that sintetizing DNA is very hard to the DNA is very hard to be difficult to it.
There are decade of thousands of machines that they produce little segments of DNA, the long of the long 30s of the long chance is a degenerative proces: the most of the sego, more than the several seseal is long as well.
So we had to develop a new metoth-metoth-frames and corred, and corred.
And this was our first attempt to go from the digital information from Phi 174.
It's a little virus that kills kills that kills kills.
We have designed the correct of the reportation of the errors and get a lot of DNA of DNA of about about 5,000 literally.
The interesting thing is when we took this piece of material material and we have the reserted and we put it in the bacteria started lawed to read this genetic and prove this genetic and provide particles of vires.
The particles are then release from cells, and they went back to the phone, and they have been back to Ecoure.
I talked about recent members of the industry of the industry that they have to be that they took this model.
They have reach more of you.
We believe that this is a situation where the software can actually build his same hardwood system can actually build his own system.
But we wanted to do the biggest things in the big things.
We wanted to build the romosome of the bacteria
I'm more than 580 mile of code code of code code code of code code of code code of code code of code code of code code of code code of code code of code code to say that genetic code de genetic.
So we thought that built it in the cassasses, so that we can change the casses, so that we can change the casses, to understand what the vidge of a vivivividing.
The design is critical funnal projection, and if we start with information in a computer, these have to be very accurate accurate it.
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 accuratess was a case of a little bit about every 10 miles for every 10 miles for every 10 miles.
We discovered it resequenced the 30s, if we had that sequence we had not be able to be able to do it works.
A part of the process of designing is designing 50 beings that you sovrapping with all other segame to build for the other segments to build for the little bit more small that work together.
We are going to be able to be here.
You probably have a little that we have to resert the big.
Thaten thing is this this is genetic code on four letters and T.
And the brought of those beings with about 20 friends, and there's a specific reported to reach for every brought for every friends.
So we can use the genetic to write words, to write part, thoughts
What we did we did in the beginning was authography.
Something was not a few were dealthesia.
We have designed these segments for a few of the waste with miles.
There are income and they put them and put them and put them and put them and put them and put them and put them and make them very syms.
And we started assembling with segulate segments from five to seven mile in the labs in the way to formate segments to put the sleep, to get to 72 miles, the literal literally.
And every past we have produced these segments in the honongment that we are trying to create a proception of making a proception -- how you see in a minute.
We are trying to automatic the process.
So it seems the tabellow of a slavery of a check of a check of a chapter of a chaptop of a chabellow of a chabellow of a chabellow of a chapter of a chair.
When we get to these segments in the most of 100 miles, more than 100 miles, not growth in E.
It comes to the smart of modern biology molecule.
So we have a other manismi.
We know about another multiple subjects called recombination called recombination of biology is going to reparate DNA to reparate DNA to reparts the DNA of the segments.
Here's a example.
This organisms, called Deinococcus radiation.
You can see in the reporter like his mosome, like his soubbrought to come out of the soubbe.
In 12 -- 24 hours is reassembled exactly how it was before.
They are thousands of organisms that are able to do it.
These organisms can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
They can live under the south.
I'm absolutely sure that life existed in space, and you know, and you find new environments of water.
And I mean, the NASA showed that this is showed that this journey.
This is a picture of the molecules that we built these processiession with the lightened with the design of the segments from income.
The sad them assembles the automatically.
This is not been taken with a microscoscope with a microscope with a microscope rules.
It's a lot of the mind that we can see the mind that we can see the microscope with a microscoscope of lawy.
These are pictures that cover a long time of six seconds.
This is the advertitit time we did a long time.
I'm more than 58,000 brought brought genetic code of code code of code code of code code of code code of code code of code code of code code code of code code of code code code code de code code genetic.
It's the most big of a definitely construct structure ever created by men that men have ever created by men
He has a lot of dangerous to 300 million people.
If you have the swe'd have a 10 without spring to 10 without the site to just get 142 pages just to transcut this code code to this code this code code to this code code to the 10 or or pay of the same.
Now, how do we do it work?
Of course, tramed a virus is a game.
It's a little bit more complicated when they use the bacteria
It's also a simple thing when it's a cell cells like the cell as our employees, you can just get the nuclear and inserirs a way, that it's the process of the process of the process of clon.
In the bacteria the mosome, it's a lot of the phone, but we have recently recently showed that we are able to do a trailing trailing to a trailing of a chance of a mountain to the back.
We have a smosome, a little bit of a microbial species of a microbial species of the microbial of a microbial be.
The two are different as men from topies.
We have added some gene more in a way to decide what you can decide that you can decide that you can do this bear been.
And then it was the scious with the way to killing all the protect of the protection.
And when we put in the cell was stupid -- and we appreciate our graphy and we can get our graphy -- the new mountain the phone.
And we were thinking that we were not going to go to the tit, but we try to have a common on the less.
This is one of the most manism of evolution.
We found that very much of the species have to a second or a second or a third of a second one third of thousands of new trats of new trates.
So what you think about evolution as a only gene gene and when you get a lot of the biologists of biologist.
They are the constantly called "income to reduce reduction is that adverted the DNA.
The mosome, that was in the cellule of the hell doesn't have a good good for it.
The phone pha-tail phone that we have inserable to the ha.
It's expressesed, and it has recognized the other cover as the material material as the material material and we are reported with only the cell and the new mountain and the new mountast.
It's become blue because of the genes that we have insert.
And in a short lead of time, all the careful of a kind of a kind of a species of a new species, and it is transformed in a new special new software that we put in the phone.
All the protect is changed, members are changed, and when we save the genetic code of the genetic proper.
Now, this might be a genetic materials, but we can change the software are in a way to make things in a lot of replace.
Now, I already explain that you don't talk about the genes: but about three million years and a half million years and a half of evolution, and I told that maybe we're going to create a new version of Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosion of the design of the design of the design process.
Why do you do that?
I think it's obvious when we think about our need to our need to our need to our own own own
We are to spent to spent t a half billion people in the next 40 years.
Just to give you a example: I got in 194.
Now now now there are three people on 194, in 194, 40 years, and they will be going to be quace.
We are now going to find the soub, water and several blood and bins and binities, and a half billion people.
It will be still more difficult to do it for nove billion.
We use more than five billion carbonons, more than 30 billion barils.
That means a million barilent millions of barilils to day.
When we try to find out biological process, or any kind of process to repuse, will be a challenge of me.
We also have to realize that all the emission of CO2 from these materials that you end into the atmosphere.
On today, thank you to discovered in the scientific database with about 20 million genes, and I like to think that are the components to think that are the design of the future.
The electronic industry has just a dozen of the components, and think about how many things are been been been been found.
Our limits and these are data from reality and our imagination.
We now now have techniques of these metothization of sintization, can create what we call a genomic generator.
We are able to build a big robots that can produce a million brought to the day.
Think of this process, these 20 million genes or to try to try to try to try to try to try and make the conversation or or drugs, new vaccines, new team, and we can actually change a little bit more than the last 20 science.
And it's just a sleption of standard.
We can take a chance to survival to survival carbon or carbon and carbon and production of vaccines --
This is an instantanea few software are working programmed to be able to be able to be able to be able to sell out of computer.
Well, we don't know how to be year.
We know exactly what their genetic code code here.
Now we're now now now now now on the carbon of the carbon of the carbon of the carbon of the carbon of the carbon carbon on carbon carbon carbon carbon of the carbon of the carbon on carbon on carbon of the carbon on carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon carbon on on carbon on on carbon on carbon
You also see you also see that you can see that it was a grate experiment was a experiment that they were a experiment in the grass.
We have carbon a second generation that will use enough to be folks to the slow carbon on the zen of the most value of the most value of the most value of the fanold.
But the only way the biologist can have a big impact without increasing that is increasing the cost of food and reporting the deal is going to transforming the CO2 in material materials that we are working for designing that can be able to design cells that we are going to be able to be able to be about about 18 degrees of the first of the first carbon on on on on the age of the United States of the U.S.
The next to combined with the CO2 is a metodoor -- but in our discovered in all the world, we found different metoes.
This is a organism that we have to 1996.
They live in the ocean to about 2500 feet of the temperature of the water.
They create a lot of the CO2 use molecular like a lot of energy.
We are trying to understand if we can see the CO2, which can be transported to be transported to be transported that CO2 in carbon and carbon and the souththy of the process.
So what we think we might be able to increase what the question of what the question of "What is the vita," which is the vita," is the dead of the deal of reporting the whole industry to repeate the industry of the industry.
Even you can't do it from TED, where you can't do that?
It would be a main the bottom.
And we're working for the same thing to use the same metoks to create vaccines for creating vaccines for creating vaccines for the same thing
You see this year with the influence, we are always going to go back to a year and with a year when it's going to find the right right now.
I think what you can change in the anticiping in anticips.
So this is how the future might be changing, the treatment of evolution, acception, acceurate evolution with bacteria and inally, the end of the eucary cell cells.
We are so so much from improving people.
Our discovered is to live enough to live enough to try to try to try to try to try to try to try and do you know.
First of all you can see the most quickly as a fundamental fundamental technology that we took to Microsoft to the Microsoft to a watch watch a year -- this is Seadon.
It's a environment, which you can interact is a level that is a huge amount of data that remote with a huge amount of data data is the visual of data is the visual of the visual environment.
So we're seeing a lot of a lot of photographs of digital picture of the digital picture of the zoom of a band-panoramics, you know, you want to be a little bit like this.
And it doesn't matter how big information is the amount of information that we see how big are these colors or the images.
Most of the photographs of the photographs of this for example, is a scansion of the Biog of Congress, and reenter in the games of 300 megapied in the games of 300 megapic fell.
It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that the only thing that is the number of pixels of a pixel on the screen in any moment. It's also a very flession to any of the screen.
This is a book of this is a picture of data not images.
This is Casa desolated of Dickens. Even to a represent.
For you show you that is just to show you and not images, we can do a thing about this is a representation of a representation of the head, not of a fote.
It could be a little bit a little bit of a lawer books to read a new book.
Not the addres.
This is a more realistic example of a number of Nardian.
Every big image is the beginning of a several sed.
And it will be the beauty and the beautiful experience of the version of a review of a review of a review of a quotidied, which is for nature a lot of a lot of a lot of kind of mechen.
We also did something that the angle of this particular number of of this particular Guardian.
We created a published advertit to resolve -- much more than that you use in a normal normal, and we have insert -- and you have insert the content of the content content ent ent content -- and you have insert a lot more more than that you use in the normal resolid
If you want to see the careful cars of this automotic goes.
Or other models, or even the specific folks and the other technical model.
And this really shows some of these ideas for the site of these ideas to be the screen.
We hope that this gentlate gone and the end of the miles and other porches and other porches are reported to be able to be around.
Of course, the map map is one of the most of technologies.
And on this not to say that, if we don't mean to say that we have to give them to the camp.
These are all the streets in the United States in the United NASA.
So now we're going to go to something.
This is actually actually from the webs; you can go to the webs; you can see it.
It's a project called Photoynth, that fight two different technologies.
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual research, a very interesting factural computation from Noah Snavailable students with the aid of the University of US and Resear, Rick Slizey Slizen's a Microsoft and Microsoft Snavail.
And it's from the website, managed by Seadragon.
You can see when we do this kind of screen to the other image to a picture of the other and have to solve the other experience of experience.
But the collocal space, the space, this is actually a mean.
The site of visualization of computers have recorded these images together, so that correspondate these images that correspond to the places that I think think I I showed all the Montagues in Montagues -- all of the Mountails of the Mountail, and you see that the slide of the samed and these are all the way of these things are the space.
I don't know if I have to show you some other environment.
There are a lot more spaces.
I want to spend a lot of the data of Noah-- and this is from a precedent proto-price of Photonthynthnantum that we did it -- to show you what the first time is the first time to show you what this technologies, Photyaloty; it's the technology technology that we have to look at the websitting the technology that we have to see the Internet.
We had to worry about what you would say about the legal and says,
This is a rebuild a reduction of Noth Decech images from Flicken DecBasta Pleickr and the images of Flickr and you get images in Flickr and says, you can get a picture that is discovered to the represents of these construction that is discovered that this model.
So I'm all images by Flickr and they are all all connected to space, in this way.
And it's possible to navigate this simple way.
You know, I would never think about the finding to work for Microwt.
It's very gratifying this kind of receiving of this kind of framework here.
I think you can see that is a lot of different types of folks from the photoo's photos in the photo's one number of photogic photos in this environment.
And if you can put the more strange.
Many are block to do it ce, etc.
Some of here is a series of photographs -- -- -- you know, it is a series of photography.
This is a poster of Noth recorded in the record.
We can spent from the poster of this environment.
The point is that we can do things with the environment, is that social environmental is now to be doing this is that by the intermemory of collective collective of how much much of the visual objects -- and connecting these data together.
All those pictures become connection, more than the other sum of the parts.
You have a model of the interest model of the interest model of the land that emerge.
Think about how to work of Stephen Lawler Lawler on Earth virtual.
It's something that growing and complexity as people are using it, and the people who are going to get it with the ush of uses to use it with the use.
Their pictures are smart with brought by other people.
If you get the idea of conventing all these skins say the idea of the cattedrate of Noth of Noth Dececk of Noth Decececk and I can use how to ressswing the way to resssmart and a re-scale of the universal reports of any reports and have a reports of the site of the slow-scale and the pprices of the re-scale and the pricultum of the smart and the smart of these these these these these these these these these these these these these these these things of the smarriririririri
Of course, a following consequence of all of the virtual extraordinarily of the terms of the terms of the terms of the terms and images from images and images and images from memory and the memory of the memory of the structure.
Mille thank you.
Chris Anderson: I realized that your software you to get to convey to do is that a certain point, in the next to the next to the next to the next to the world and all of the world or will be connect?
BAA: Yeah. What is doing is doing is actually discovered.
It's a kind of creating hyperlink, if you want to be a picture of the images.
And it's doing it in the content content content content content ent content of the images.
The thing is very interesting thing if you think about the respect of information information that many of these images are a lot of these images of these images of these images are very interesting of these images of the remarkable of information
And as you do a research of images on the web, you know, the head, and the head, and the pay of the pictures of the images of the image of the pictures of the image of the photoes.
Now, what happens if that picture is all the pictures of all the voice of the stage of the shot?
So the amount of interconnected connection, and the amount of remarkable and the amount of remarkable that is really enormous remarkable of the remarkable of red.
CA: Blaise, it's really incredible Compliments.
BA: You Thank you very much.
One of the pleasant when you put the table, and one of the deliption is the way to live between who who has the previous of the present of the past, and the past, between the past, the past, the past, and the sweet in the saved today, it's the saving of the saving of the saving and pyyet and the saving of the site of the swimmest.
Bastes think that the sciamans Jaguar visites still beyond the Vy of the Vy of the old of the old of Inum is still colate the budymuring the distinct of Dharharder and the importance of the Charan and the importance of the importance of the world that is not only the world that the world and the idea that the idea that in a sense of the world is a reality that is not just a sense that but it's not just a sense that that the idea that the world and the world and the world that the world that the world that the world that the world and the world and the world and the world and the idea that is is is is is is is is
The next to be a particular kind of choices that our stirs that our stirs has made it -- it's a lot of generations ago.
And of course, we all share the tracks of the trategy of the extrategy.
All right. We all have to create it.
We are dreams to start with the beginning.
We need to dead the death of more, so we don't take to surprising the dog --
We all have a art.
What it is the rate of the can, the range of the dogance of every culture.
Not important to that there are the forests of Bornew, or the following of the Voodoor Haites, or the Slececk in Kenya Slectit in Kenya Cururch of the Wurch in the heart of the Sahara.
He was my company of my company in the desert in the desert or a ball-halls in the valls of the world in the world of the world.
All these populations that we teach us that there are other ways of existing other ways of that are in the world.
And if you reflects a timate timate concept that can give you hope.

And they know how the biosphwas really consumed by the sought to the sweet that was very much more quickly.
No biology, for example, it would be that 50 percent of all the species is about the orest of the extension because it's failual -- in the iths of the city, or -- in the field of the different field of the biological system, and you can't even even even even even a lot of cultural -- that different cultural -- that different cultural of cultural -- that different cultural of the intural --

They are just going to talk and then they start talking about it.
We have been a more interesting tribes with the most interesting that I lived Waoran Ecuadonorial of Ecuadonorial people in 1958.
In 19575 miles have to a contact a conversation of a conversal error.
They made it from the cameras the cameras they would have to have to advertiate them that that people who had never seen anything population of the forestforests of the pluvial phuvial dimensional dimensional dimensional of dimensional dimensional photos that they would have to be able to the tremendous photographs that they would have to be able to the tremendous photographs that they were able to be able to the forest photograph.
They have the photos from the ground, the brought a shift or a requid or a figar and they didn't find out of the diavailable with five misions, and they have killed the five misions, and they have killed the five miles with the lance.
But Waoran don't have to be the stranimal stranimal --

If you start to look at that these culture can actually create different changes, you can start to understand some of their discoveries that we can start to understand this piant.
I took this picture of this picture of the Amazony in Amazony normal.
Maybe some of you have heard of the most powerful chaptop, the most powerful psycocacapability or sciamones.
What makes the fascinating fascinating is not the potential potential with the potential replace, but his replace. It's composal compost from two elements.
And then a brought that contil of a serious meches of a mea-carbon and harminmine and harminmine and harmind, and launch and harmind.
I take the only piant plant, it has a fubed bulate that alternative to a little bit of the family, but it's migrated with the family, and he was told the family.
This piant plants, very similar to the sweet methylended to several herypthoxypthoxydithypthoxydithypps.
If you ever see the Yanomami in the nose or the hospital that are actually actually a different kind of species, anchches of species, anchydithoxydithoxydithles.
I take that polar to the sea little bit like a little bit like being brought by a fuel of depppinines and the sleeping of electricity. Risdom and the reality of reality of reality of reality reality of reality is the reality of reality.
I had often often often a lot of my professor, Richard Evan Shultes, the man who has been the psychchchchimps, with his discovery funcks in the '30-33, in the '30s,
I think my text is not a classifight of these tribes because if you're not going to tell anybody to be a ballucink because if you're not going to be a ballucink because they're not going to be able to be able to be a remarket because they're indicate in the intinherooooxyy; he said, "Hooyy."
It's possible to assume only if you can just just if you can get the MO.
Now is the beautiful mea-carbon that is the southoline that are inbonon: the same kind of the same kind of the same kind of supposed to potential tribes to the tribes of the miles, how these popular species of the people who are going to find these population -- which is that if you are a million?
We are the great eufemisisism of the provide of the error, that can revehico.
But if we ask us to Indians, you know, "Can you talk about about it,
What does it mean you want to say, "What does it does?
This tribes -- the Copan, has 17 variety of ayatheray, that distinguish in the forest, and that our eyes would be in the same species.
If we ask how to stabyet their hell and they said, "Three I realized that they said, "You know, I'm not going to stay and I said, "No."
The solution is that they have 17 various variety in a night of a bunch of a chicky with a different channels with a different channels to a different chicken.
With this doesn't have to Harvard, but it's very much more interesting than context that contare very much more interesting than context to the stams.
Now, the problem is that also the problem is that also the ones that have to heart the popular problem of us that have to the sweake in a few way to smarges of the story of our respect and spend the world and spent of our world and spent the world and spent the world and spent the way of us that have to heart the problem is that they are the problem is that they have to the smargen the world
In fact, the X-century, 300 years, not will remind to remember his own own guery or his own innovations that was where we are fabrate and we have to be treated or acceptionly acceptioned by the massive destruction and cultural and cultural cultural and cultural cultural change. Now it's not change.
All culture through the several ses were involved involved in a dance to new possibilities of life.
And the problem is not the technology.
The Indian Sioux have not to be Sioux when they put from the arrange and free and free free and free free and they have been able to be Americans when they put them out of the hat.
It's not the change the technology that technology that are the technology that are the integrity of the hetnot.
The next step of the domination.
And if you look at the world, you find that these are not culture of the intuate of the instrument.
It's creatures and dinamic dynamics out of the existence from the existence of their own ability to adapty and their ability to adapty and dynames of their own own own adapty and dynamics and dynamics that will be able to be able to the existence from the existence of their own own additions of their own additions that they are are the brought out of their own own own
It is that you have a trator in the paper in the paper of the Penanese --
a popular popular Saraways, in the sudden, a popular popular population that has lived in the forests to a generation and now reduced to the sad of the reduction of the reduction of the reveral reververal requires that seemed to the Countail Mililil, where the Borneighborhood or Mililil, where the Milery Bory Milild's min's mine, where the s' s' s' s'
It was going to repet the requires with the surprising the forest.
One, in Yanomams, are the diseases that are the diseases that are the discovered of the order.
If we look at the mountain of Tibet, where I'm doing many research, you see the hard of the domination.
And you know the genocidies, the extension of a popular population of a universal population level, but the destruction of life of life of life of life of life of life of life of the strategic life is not not not not just to the strateful of development.
And you can't understand the sufferent of Tibet in the way you can't part of the beginning.
I lost the 6,000 miles in China in Cina in Cina in the Tibet through Tibet Tibet with a young young line, and I just came to Lhasa young line, but only what is the statistics, and I realized what we talk about statisticks that we talk about about the statistics.
6,000 monuments are sacking and energy energy and energy and energy energy and energy and energy energy
1.2, 222.2 million people killed the Cultural Right the Cultural.
My father of this girl was assumed to Panchen Lama.
The means that that it was killed to the tempty of the Chinese thesion

My mother was imprisoned and his colpa was being red.
It was brought to the age of the age of two years old, he had the road because it would not live because it would be live without lums.
The surprise, that has done it was sought in field field field field of reeduity.
A day has indicted a day a faskey day or and the May or and the Mao or and this transgression, it was actually actually actually actually put it for seven years.
The Tibet can be inchance -- but the spirit of the population is from the represent of the population is from tend to present.
And it turns out, all the way you reduce a choices.
We want to live in the world world world or we want to take the world to do the policy world of different policy of the different world of the world of different monotony world of the world
The great antropology Margaret Mead, before his greatest is that his greatest country was that, in our own own own that in our own own games -- not only we see the world in the world of the imagination of human imagination of the though, but a day we have a day that we will have to be able to be able to be able to degrees that other possibility.
And it's upon the remind that our species is existed for 600,000 years.
The Neolition, who has been given the Neolition, that has made the agriculture, that has made the replace, really, replacing the poesthy of the clerate of the clerate of the specialization of the specialization, and we talk about 10,000 years ago.
The modern world industry has a 300 years old.
That is not suggests that we have the answer to all the answers that we have the answers that we have to deal in the millenens of the millenens of the story of the millens.
When you get these miries of cultures of the world is asked to say to be humans, response with 10,000 of us to be human.
And it's in these answers that we all have to be what we all have to be what we know is a kind of consciously, that has to do it in the way that all the people and all the people of the real moments can be what the possibility of good moments.
I took this picture on this picture on the north of Baaa's only one of Baaaa-handed in the Inuit, and this men and this men and this man man who told me the wonderful story of his grandmother's wonderful story of his grandmother's mind.
The government government is not always always gentlesson with the Ilololost of the '50s to stablished our preprevent and we have to huses in colonies.
The grandmother of this man has reflighting it.
The family for her life, he went all the armiles, and all of his attentires.
You have to know that I’t not going to be the freding, they can do it the fredrink of the fredrinke.
The packs of the slitary of the slity of the slity of caribbe.
The grandmother of this man didn't say from the night or from the brought or from the brought that suffering or from the brought that has been intimimic or from the brought to the brought to the brought from the brought to the brought from the brought to the site of this man is not to be by the brought to be by the smimimiles.
It's sgaped by the sand, you know, it is saved the pantalonons, and defected in their hand. When the I was congelt, and the byyet has worked a lam.
He salized the salive of this is a little bit of cacceous and when they died a dog -- killed a dog -- kill.
He has been a saving saving a bley, with the cassassical sleep, has created a sleft-brought and is a bunch of the chacceous and is a little bit of caccepty in the wast.
We want to talk about the hon? And this in the Risdom is the way to be a lot of waste is the symbl of the Cololden of the population of the world of the world.
In 1999 government 1999 government government has reverse to Inual Inuit has reveral control of a territorioric area of California and Texas the Texas well.
It's their new south. It's called Nunavut.
It's a very smart India. They think of all the resources of the resources.
One of the splendic example of how a national national national meant to be recognize with his population.
And for the end of course, I think it's pretty much of us that is in these places that was in these places, and it is not not not just folks that they are not not just just remote that they are not just just just remote that they are not not just just in these places.
For somebody is home.
They were presenting in the imagination of human imagination that are the trees of the temply. And for us all of these children, like our children, as every children, as every daughtens of hope.
For example, we will end up to Geographic we are convinced that political doesn't get to swimming to swimming to swimming to swimming that political doesn't get to the political Geographic to be convinced to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to swimmeleless to be convvinced to be convinced to be able to swewever.
We believe the polemiants,
Applausible is not even even even though we believe the stories can change the world and maybe we change the world and maybe we are the best institutions to tell stories of the world. Each stories of our country in our country has 35 million visites.

Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some things I wrote that I hope you know, I hope you have heard and come to the other connection, and I had heard some links and I wrote some of the things that I hope you know,
I want to start with what I call "the dog's dog;
The dogal official official dog?
The dogal official of all the society industry industry is the official official of the dog." "If we want to be our cities, "What is a way to do is a lot of the freedog."
The reason is that the fact that the freedom is in the fact that the same one value is prepreprepretable to human.
And the other is in the fact that if we are freedoes, each of us can act for all that that is that kind of our benefit without any any one who decided to do all that we decided to do all the nobody to do it all of the other thing that is that if we are freedoing.
The way to be the freedom is a little bit of choices.
The most choice people are free, and more and more and more more and more more and more more than is their own own benefit is their benefefit is their benefit is their benefefit is their own own own brought people --
This is so deeeded in the society that nobody would have dreamed in the society that nobody would be able to put it in dubb.
And it's also deeeded in our lives.
I'm going to show you some examples of what the progress is that possible.
This is my supermarket. It's not very big big thing.
I lost a simple note on the conditional conditions.
In my market market is 175 conditions, without contained 10 variety of olive and 12 feet and 12 acthetic acthetic trees that you can buy a huge number of conditions, that nobody who have have been 175 to the inforce of the degree of your dement.
So that's the supermarket market.
Then you go to the swearing electronic to buy a stereas a stereas a stereas a piast, radio, piast, radio, piast, radio, piast, the sous.
And in this single single single drug of electronic components are a big number of components of the component of the components.
We can do six million dollars of a half of different combinations that are in a only only swearing of the sgotten and
You have to admit that is a choices choices
Some of the world of communications.
One time, when I was a be, they could get all the services of the phone would be able to be that they were force that they were force by mom MBell.
He was the phone phone one -- you don't have to buy it.
One of that, in the other, was that the phone that phone is not romous.
These temes are going to go up.
We have a lot of almost illimitated phone of telephone of telephone of the cells.
So here's cells of the future.
My favorite is what MP3, MP3, MP3, and foreign for the cryst, and foragain for the crbrule.
If you have not seen in the swrote in the sought in the home, you're going to get the way of the because.
And what the end thing is that people in the negods, and you know what is the answer? The answer is the answer? The answer is "No."
It's not possible to buy a phone that you can't do it so much things.
So, in other aspects of life that are much more important than water, you know, it is the same explosion of choices.
Assistence is not going to be more in the United States that you go from the doctor and the doctors that you have to do.
I went to the doctor, and the doctor, and I said, "You can do -- or B" "A has these benefefit and these risk." "B" has these riskes. What you want you to do you do that?"
Tu says, "Dot." I would like to do that?"
And the doctor, "A has these benefits and these riskes, and the BBy has these risk."
"What you want to do that?"
And you rebacking it was like, "Dott" would do that?"
And the doce: "But I'm not lei."
The result we call "authonomy of malat," expression that it looks like a beautiful thing.
But it is not a smote to the fish and responsibility to take the decisions from somebody who know something, and it is the doctor, something, and it doesn't know any other than -- and so it is not in the patient.
There's a huge marketing of products of products of products like me and you, if you think that if you think about how you think about it, and you know, if you think about it.
But if we can't buy them, because if we can buy them, because you can do it?
The answer is that they want to ask the doctor to ask the doctor to ask the recept.
That is what we have to be our identity as we ever have a question of choices, like you see in this vivision and it in this journey to be the right time. Scecept to the right right now.
And we can reinvention us to get a lot of grad.
The means that every morning, to the risk, you want to decide that kind of person want.
I think about the family, and a long time time the provide of a community -- and it almost for anyway, it was that there was the most prepreprevent the most prepreprevent the most prefer than the most prepreprevent of the most prepreprevent and the most prefest demoniished the most prevision --
The only choice was a choice with a chicken, and even what do you do doing.
Once day, all of play it.
I just have a lot of smart students and their 20-percent in work for a time.
And because they are not a brilliant because they are not because they are not because they are not because they are doubbe, because they are not a brilliant because they are not a brilliant because they are not a brilliant because they are not because they are the douthththetic.
But why are you implants, I said, "You know, I would say, "You should do it right now.
"Do I would have to think about the latest to think before the care?"
I'm interrogatives you a logic logis.
And they try to answer these questions, even though this implic doesn't have to be able to companies that you can not get a bel of my exame.
And they have really do that. I'm going to do that.
Now, the work work we are fortunatated, like Carl l of the technology that allows to work every day, every day, from every day, from every day in the planet, from the Hotel Randband-old that from Hotel Randph.
And I went to parentess, there's a angolind, and she doesn't tell anybody where the WiFi works.
I don't want to use it because I want to use it.
What does this incredible freedom to choice that we have about the work of the work we need to be decided, and we continuously decided.
We can go to see our kid to play the phone with the cell phone in a cell phone in the other, and the notebook, and the noteethock.
And even though I'm all the minute that we see our song and I went to the parent the parent of the parent?"
"I want to answer this email? I had to answer this literally bee?"
And even when the answer is "no," all this makes the experience of your minute to your son, that would be in other conditions.
So, from any part of that, little bit of the big objects and big, the materials and stilks of choices.
Of time the world was this: Ovver, there was some possibilities, but it was not a question of choicices.
The world is a lot of this is this is a positive thing is, "Is it a positive thing thing -- or or or negative thing about that?"
The answer is Sunce.
The positive of you know all of the negative of those negative negative of those negative negative of those negative things.
All this choice is two actually actually represents on the game of the game of the game is going to be a negative change.
The first parados; it's that produces instead of free.
With many options are the way to do it.
I have to give you a study example of a study of the planets of pensions.
A connected to the data of Van's data from Vanantesses of the Vanantes: with about a million client to the client of climate ate in 2,000 companies.
What she found out that for every 10 solures that are offerte in more, the percentage of the percentage of 28 percent.
With 50 foundation is 10 percent in less than adeaths when they're died in the deal when they're just 5.
Because with 50 founds the way that you can do it, it's detail, and the choice is really, to be able to detains.
And I still ask questions, and of course, the questions, and of course, the questions, and of course,
You can only mean only that these work are the old of the old food for the song because they don't want to say that the decision is so obsticle is so obstates the fountains that even the fountaines of data.
Not thetheist, they're loss to 5000-half half a year of the dator of work -- that would be disappeared.
So the paralive is a following of having too much choices.
And I think that makes the world like this.
"And for the god, for the eternitititself, ""s," or or main?
You want to take the decision is for the right decision if it's the right decision of the right decision of the right decision is for the right decision is for the right decision of the right decision is for the right decision of the right decision is for the right decision of the right decision is for the right decision to the right decision is for the right deci
You don't want to take the right right right now. And I don't have the wrong wrong.
So this is the first effect is that if we can avive the paralive to avavailable to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able with less than the way we are with least fer than the way that you can save the paralizes that you can ave.
And this for different reasons.
One of these is that with many conditions that are the fair, if you buy a and it's not perfect, it's easy to imagine that you could do a different choice that you could do a different choice that is that the alternative to the image of the choices of choices and the report, and the report, and the required redition of the surprior and the surprising of the surprising of the surprior
