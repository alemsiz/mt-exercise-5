I showed these <unk> <unk> <unk> that the <unk> <unk> <unk>, which for almost three million years had the size of the United States <unk>, <unk> 40 percent <unk>.
I'm going to <unk> this problem because it doesn't show the <unk> of the ice.
<unk> <unk> is, in a certain sense, the heart <unk> of the global global warming.
It's <unk> and <unk> in the summer.
The next <unk> will be a <unk> <unk> <unk> on the last 25 years.
<unk> <unk> are <unk> in red.
And you see, it's <unk> to the blue <unk>.
That's the ice in <unk>, which is <unk> summer.
You can see that the <unk> ice <unk>, of five years or more, it's like the blood, which here <unk> from the body.
In 25 years it's been so.
This is a problem because the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> around the ocean <unk> where there are huge <unk> of <unk> that, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> from the <unk>.
<unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk>, that amount of global <unk>, that could <unk>, <unk> this point.
In some of the <unk> <unk> is already <unk> <unk> from the water.
The <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> has <unk> with a <unk> team <unk> last <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>! <unk>: <unk>! <unk>: She's good. The question is if we <unk> it.
A reason is that this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from the north.
This is a river in <unk> <unk>.
<unk> had never <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This is the <unk> river, in the <unk> <unk>.
If you want to know how the <unk> is <unk> for the sea level of <unk> <unk>, here is where the sea.
These <unk> are <unk> <unk>.
<unk> else on the planet: <unk>, the largest <unk> of ice on the planet.
<unk> month scientists have <unk> that the <unk> of the ice is in <unk>, and that <unk> <unk> on some <unk> <unk>, is particularly <unk> in <unk>.
<unk> at <unk> feet of the <unk>, like in <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, the third largest <unk> of ice, you see new <unk>, which a few years ago were <unk>.
<unk> percent of the world's population <unk> water from that <unk>.
<unk> <unk>: this <unk> is the <unk> of the water <unk> of this city.
The <unk> is <unk>.
But when we do that, the same happens to <unk> water.
<unk> <unk> 40 percent.
<unk> <unk> are in the crisis.
<unk>, as you read, they're <unk>.
<unk> <unk> in the world is <unk> to a <unk> increase in the <unk>.
<unk> <unk> are <unk> out of the normal and <unk>.
Sometimes, more <unk> in the last 30 years to the <unk> <unk>.
This is a <unk> of the whole <unk>.
If you look in the <unk> context in the context of the <unk> can see the <unk>.
We've been <unk> 70 million <unk> in the last five years of CO2 <unk> every 24 hours -- 25 million <unk> in the ocean every day.
Look at the <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and on both <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, where there's a <unk> <unk> of oxygen in the ocean.
The largest cause of global warming, together with <unk>, which is 20 percent, is the use of <unk> <unk>.
<unk> is a problem, and <unk> is even worse.
The United States is one of the two countries with China.
And they're going to build a lot of other <unk> <unk>.
But we're <unk> to a <unk> of the direction.
These are the projects that are in the last years and some <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
And so, there's a <unk> of politics in our country.
<unk> and oil <unk> <unk> million dollars in the last year to <unk> <unk> <unk>, which is a <unk>.
I'm going to put something --
<unk> <unk>, where I live, there was a <unk> <unk> billion <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
You may have seen it on the <unk>.
This is the second largest flow of <unk> in America.
It's happened around <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> of one of the <unk> <unk> was this.
<unk>: <unk> â™« <unk> is a <unk> <unk> guy.
It's <unk> here in America, and it makes our economy.
<unk> <unk> is <unk>.
It's <unk>, <unk> and <unk> <unk> it.
<unk>: From this comes a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The largest <unk> society <unk> is <unk> <unk>. This is his <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> <unk>. <unk> <unk> -- Al <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> -- they don't know what they're talking about.
<unk>: So the <unk> for the <unk> <unk> <unk> two <unk>.
This is one of them, one part.
<unk>: <unk>: <unk> <unk> we see the changes as a <unk> <unk> to our business.
So, for our <unk> is <unk> a big amount of money in a public <unk> for public and <unk> the truth.
In fact, <unk> is not <unk>.
We think it's <unk> -- it's also good <unk>.
So we don't know about climate change.
We're going to do.
<unk>: <unk> <unk> -- you know, <unk> <unk> -- you've heard a lot of it.
So we <unk> a <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk>.
<unk>! <unk>! <unk> are a little <unk>, but this is the sound of the technology of <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> is between the major <unk> of global warming, but <unk> technology <unk> that you see changes everything.
Let's look at this: this is <unk> <unk> technology.
<unk>: <unk>, the <unk> <unk> <unk> to the economic issue and the national security.
<unk>: <unk> America is in the crisis; the national security, the national <unk>, the crisis <unk>.
The <unk> that <unk> all of them: our <unk> <unk> <unk>, like <unk> and oil <unk>.
Now, but there's a new thing, <unk> solution.
<unk> America: 100 percent of <unk> energy in 10 years.
A plan to <unk> America at work, <unk> more <unk>, and help <unk> global warming.
<unk>, a solution that we're going to solve our problems.
<unk> America. <unk> more.
<unk>: This is the last one.
<unk>: It's about <unk> energy to America.
One of the most <unk> ways to <unk> <unk> <unk> that we <unk> our planet.
<unk>: The future is here. <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> 2: <unk> <unk> for jobs that they're very <unk> <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> America. It's time to be <unk>.
Al <unk>: A old <unk> <unk> says, "If you want to go, go alone.
If you want to go far, go together. "
We have to go far, quickly.
Thank you very much.
I did a <unk> on <unk>.
And I'm going to try to <unk> about how the machine works.
So here we go. And for those who didn't have, the <unk> is the largest scientific experiment -- <unk> miles of <unk>.
<unk> is to <unk> the conditions that were in the less than a <unk> <unk> by the beginning of the universe -- to <unk> million times a second.
And that's just <unk>.
This is the <unk> machine.
They <unk> these <unk> <unk> inside the <unk>.
This is what I'm working on. It's called <unk> feet and it's <unk> feet and it's a <unk> <unk>.
This is an <unk> picture in <unk> in <unk> in the construction, so you can see the <unk>.
<unk> <unk> last year we <unk> the car for the first time.
And this picture was <unk> by <unk>.
It was because of <unk> <unk> in the control <unk>.
It's an image of the first <unk> of particles that had done all the <unk>, <unk> in <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, with a part of the <unk>, and <unk> particles inside the <unk>.
In other words, when you get that picture 10 <unk>, I'm sure that the camera, which is a great <unk>.
I don't know if it was to make us more or this, when somebody <unk> on Google and I knew that the page was there.
That means that we've had a <unk> impact on that scientific.
And we had a week later, there was a problem with the car, I had to just these <unk> here -- these <unk> <unk>.
These <unk> <unk> <unk> when the car works at the <unk> <unk>.
Now, the <unk> of you will <unk> the <unk> and <unk>, "It's not true. I'm <unk> too <unk>."
And they can do that because when they're very <unk> to become the <unk> <unk>.
So <unk> degrees, at least <unk> degrees, to a temperature temperature <unk> to that the space between stars, these <unk> can bring that <unk>.
In one of the <unk> between the <unk> <unk>, there was a <unk> <unk>.
So the <unk> <unk>, and the <unk> <unk> <unk> a electric electric electric <unk>.
This was the result.
Now, this is even more <unk> if you think that these <unk> <unk> more than 20 <unk>, and that <unk> about 30 <unk>.
They <unk> about 50 <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, what we did.
We <unk> them and <unk>.
They're now <unk> to their place.
And we'll have the end of <unk> <unk>.
We <unk> it, and we decided to get some data or <unk>, and continue so our <unk> to find out what the universe is.
Now, of course, in a certain way, these <unk> <unk> the <unk> on the value of science and engineering of <unk>. It's easy to <unk>.
I think the fact that it's so hard, the fact that it's so hard to go beyond <unk>, I think it's the value of things like <unk>.
I want to end with the words of a <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, which, <unk> <unk> of <unk> experiments of his <unk>, his <unk> was Michael <unk>, he said, "No, so <unk> for the progress of the human mind as the ideas of science are <unk>, that there are not <unk> in nature, that our <unk> are <unk>, and that there are no <unk>, and that there are not <unk>,"
Thank you.
I want to start <unk> <unk> <unk>, when, as children, <unk> <unk>.
As we were <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, they actually <unk> to think and <unk> problems <unk> relationships.
<unk> <unk> <unk> to the way that we <unk> most of the world around us.
So, as a <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of our <unk> with <unk> objects, together with my <unk> <unk>, and my <unk> <unk> <unk>, I started <unk>, I started <unk>, I started <unk>, and I was <unk>, "And if we use a computer, instead of having the <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> information with a <unk>, you can <unk> an information, <unk> with both hands,
and <unk> to our <unk>?
And the question was so interesting that I decided to explore the answer, building <unk>.
In a few words, a <unk> is a computer <unk> <unk> as a <unk>.
In a few words, a <unk> is a computer <unk> <unk> as a <unk>.
You can <unk> them with your hand, "<unk>" <unk> "between them, feel their movement and have a screen and a radio <unk>.
But <unk>, they're <unk> objects, like <unk>, you can just <unk> it.
<unk> are the example of a new tools to <unk> digital information.
And as they become more <unk>, <unk> of their <unk>, <unk>, of others, and as they get <unk>, of their <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, of their <unk>, of their <unk>, of their <unk>, to <unk>.
So let's start with some simple example.
This <unk> is <unk> to show you some video: if you put it in a direction, the video will be, if we put it in a direction, it will <unk> back.
These <unk> <unk> are <unk> of others.
If you <unk> them, it's what it's going to be.
If they're <unk>, <unk> it and they can <unk> a little bit.
If they're <unk>, <unk> it and they can <unk> a little bit.
They also <unk> their movement and <unk>.
We have <unk> that one of the interesting <unk> was that we could use common <unk> about data, for example, "<unk>" a color as if it was a <unk>.
In this case, we have three <unk> <unk> as a <unk> <unk> and I can <unk> to <unk> color in the central one where it's going to go.
and I can <unk> it to <unk> color, where they <unk>.
We'll get too much, we can <unk> it a little bit.
There are also <unk> possibilities of <unk>, like <unk>, like <unk>, and games where people can try things, and <unk> the results.
Now I'm --
This is a sequence of <unk> that I do with a <unk> program.
Here we have a game <unk> <unk> and <unk>.
<unk>, to every <unk> <unk> a letter on every <unk>, <unk> to every <unk>, <unk> to every <unk> <unk> a letter, on every <unk>, and as I was <unk> to <unk> words, he <unk> on a <unk>.
And then, after about 30 seconds, and you have a new <unk> of <unk> and new <unk> <unk>.
Thank you.
So here's a little <unk> in <unk> at <unk> <unk>, I did that I <unk> them and <unk> a video.
They're very <unk>.
And one of the interesting things of <unk> is that you don't have to give people many <unk>.
I just say, "<unk> <unk>" and they know what to do.
So here's some people who will <unk> it.
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk>, and it's the <unk> <unk>,
It actually wanted to <unk>.
They were just <unk>, for him.
Now, this is a <unk> <unk>.
We had to build a tool for the <unk> of <unk>. He's <unk>.
It can <unk> new characters in the scene, <unk> their <unk>.
It can <unk> new characters in the scene, <unk> their <unk>.
So, it's <unk> the sun.
<unk>: The sun is <unk>.
<unk>: Now he's <unk> a <unk> in the scene.
<unk>: The <unk> <unk>.
<unk>! Yeah!
So <unk> the <unk> and <unk> can make the characters --
<unk>: <unk>!
and <unk> your story.
<unk>: <unk>!
<unk>: It's a story with the <unk> <unk>, and it can tell him how it <unk>.
<unk>: It's a story with the <unk> <unk>, and it can tell him how it <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> away, <unk>.
<unk>: The last example I have time to show you is a tool, made of <unk>, to <unk> and <unk> music.
It's a tool, which is made of <unk> and <unk> music.
<unk> <unk> here from <unk> <unk> as basic, low and <unk>.
<unk> of these have four different <unk>, and you can choose which I use.
You can also <unk> these <unk> in a <unk> sequence.
And we just <unk> by doing a <unk> <unk> and a sequence.
These are the effects that you can control live, like <unk> and <unk>.
I'm going to <unk> it to a particular sound and then <unk> to <unk> it.
And then there are the <unk> effects of as time and <unk>, which is <unk> to the entire sequence.
<unk> how it works.
<unk>: <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, "the <unk>" <unk> "," the <unk> in a series, <unk>, <unk> on a series, <unk>.
Now, let's take a <unk> line.
<unk>: <unk>: Now I'm going to <unk> <unk>
<unk>: So now I'm going to <unk> the <unk> to the <unk>, so I can control the effect of alive.
<unk>: <unk>: <unk> the whole sequence <unk> time on one hand or on the other.
<unk>: So now we're going to <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk>.
<unk>: <unk> the <unk> <unk>.
So I don't have to <unk> before, but I can tell you, <unk>, <unk>.
And now, finally, I can <unk> the whole sequence <unk> <unk> the left <unk> <unk>.
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is to build new <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to how our brain work.
And today, I've had time to show you one of this <unk>, and also some possibilities that we're trying to bring out of the lab.
And the concept that I want to <unk> is that's going to <unk> this new generation of <unk> objects to <unk> media, that we're going to do this new generation of our world in the way we want.
Thank you very much.
I'm not seeing the time I'm going to talk to you.
I'm a <unk>.
<unk> books is my <unk>, but it's more of this, of course.
It's also love and the <unk> of my life.
And I'm not what it can change.
But, I said this, something particular happened in my life and my career, which has led to me to <unk> the whole relationship with this job.
The particular thing is that I <unk> wrote this book, this <unk> called "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, which, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
And the result is that <unk> now, people <unk> me as if I was <unk>.
<unk> -- <unk>, <unk>!
I'm going to go and <unk> to me, and they say, "Do you fear not get any more?
You're not afraid to write all of the life without being able to make a book that can help help help anyone? "
What can it do? "
It's <unk>, you know.
But it could go worse, except that I remember, over 20 years ago, when I started to tell people -- I was a <unk> -- I wanted to be a <unk>.
I have to come to the same <unk> <unk> by fear.
And people say, "Do you don't know you don't have to be able to be successful?
You don't fear that the <unk> of <unk> you?
You've never fear to do this <unk> all of the life without nothing out of it, and to die on a <unk> of <unk> dreams with the <unk> of <unk> <unk>? "
So, you know.
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is, "Yes."
Yeah, I'm afraid of all those things.
I've always had fear.
And I'm also afraid of a lot of other things that people couldn't <unk>.
As <unk> and other things <unk>.
But, as much about the thing I thought about writing what I thought and <unk> is why?
Is it <unk>?
It's <unk> that anyone who <unk> <unk> to be <unk> by a job that you feel was <unk> to do.
But what is so <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> about health care about health care about a way that other <unk> don't do?
How would my father, for example, he was a <unk> <unk> and I remember once in his <unk> in the 40 years of activity in which asked whether they were to be <unk> <unk>?
There was never -- that <unk> of <unk> John, how do that?
<unk>'t you look at that, what?
<unk>, engineers as <unk> have no <unk>, of course, in <unk>, <unk>, <unk> the <unk> of being <unk> <unk>.
We <unk>, we have enough this <unk>, and not just <unk> but <unk> of all of these, we have this <unk> of being <unk> <unk>.
And we don't know what we're looking at the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> that, only in the <unk> century, <unk> young people and <unk> for them.
And the ones that not seem to be really <unk> by their <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, before he died, in the last <unk> said, "Every book has <unk> me a little bit more." One extraordinary <unk> about the work of your life.
But we don't know when we're going to tell why we've heard these things so long that somehow we have completely <unk> and <unk> the <unk> that creativity and <unk> are somehow <unk> and <unk> that creativity are in some ways to <unk> and that art at the end, <unk>.
And the question I want to <unk> all here is: Are you agree with this idea?
It's good for this thing -- because it's also <unk> by a <unk> distance to me.
I think it's <unk>.
And I think it's also <unk>, and I don't want to <unk> <unk> in the next century.
I think it's better to <unk> our great <unk> to live.
And I certainly know that, in my case -- in my case -- it would be very <unk> to start <unk> to that <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> that I'm in my career.
<unk> -- <unk> look, I'm pretty young, I have about 40 years.
I still have about four <unk> of work in me.
And it's very <unk> that anything you're going to be <unk> by the world like the work that will <unk> after the <unk> of my last book.
I think, because we're all <unk>, more, or less friends here -- is <unk> that my greatest success is to my <unk>.
Oh, <unk>, what!
You know, this is the kind of thought that leads to <unk> <unk> at nine to <unk> at nine to the morning and I don't want to do that.
I'm going to continue doing this work that I love.
So, the question is, how?
And so it seems to me, after many <unk>, that the way to work to write is what it is to create a <unk> <unk> <unk>, right?
I have to have to be able to find a distance of security, and my <unk> <unk> on what's written about getting <unk>. And, as I was <unk> for this year models of how we're going to go through this year, looking for <unk> to look through time, looking for other societies, and see if we could have better ideas, and see if we have better ideas and <unk>.
about how to help people <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity.
And that research led me to the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
It's because we <unk> in <unk> and then we go back.
<unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> -- people don't believe that creativity <unk> creativity, <unk> by men, OK?
And it was thought that creativity was this <unk> <unk> and <unk> to <unk> to men in some <unk> <unk> and <unk>, for reasons, <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> <unk> these <unk> <unk> of creativity.
<unk>, <unk>, we decided to have a <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> were the same idea, but we had that sort of <unk> that kind of spirit without a <unk>.
which is <unk>, because the <unk> didn't really believe that a <unk> was somebody particularly.
I thought that a <unk> was this kind of <unk> <unk> that was <unk> literally in the <unk> of a <unk> artist, a little bit like the <unk> <unk>, and that <unk> out of <unk> <unk> the artist, and we <unk> the result of that work.
So, here's the distance I'm talking about -- that <unk> <unk> that you get from the results of your work.
And everybody thought that was so that we were <unk>, right?
So, artists were <unk> by <unk> things, like the too <unk>, you know, right?
If your work was <unk>, you didn't <unk> <unk> all the <unk>, everybody <unk> that was <unk> by this <unk> <unk>.
If your work <unk>, it wasn't all your <unk>, right?
<unk> that was your <unk> to be a <unk>.
And so people are <unk> <unk> creativity for a long time.
And then the <unk> <unk> and everything <unk>, and we <unk> this big idea; we put the human being at the center of the universe over the <unk> and the <unk> and not leave space to <unk> creatures that <unk> from <unk>.
This was the <unk> principle and <unk> people started thinking that creativity was <unk> by <unk>.
And for the first time in history, they <unk> to this one or that artist as a <unk> as a <unk> as a <unk> <unk> to a rather <unk> person with a <unk>.
And I have to <unk>, I think it was a big <unk>.
I think you can somebody, a simple person to believe that being like a <unk> like the source, <unk> and <unk> of all <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> and <unk> and <unk> is a <unk> <unk> too big to give human <unk>.
It's like to ask someone to <unk> the sun.
<unk> and <unk> and completely <unk> the <unk> and makes all these <unk> <unk> on the <unk>.
And I think it was this pressure to have <unk> artists in the <unk> 500 years.
And, if that is true, and I think it's the question, is it becomes, and right now?
Can we do that?
We want to go back to a more <unk> understanding of human relationship between human and <unk> <unk>.
Or maybe not.
We may not <unk> 500 years of thinking about <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And there are probably people in the audience who are <unk> <unk> <unk> on their <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, do you make the <unk> <unk> on their projects.
I'm probably not going to <unk> you all of this.
But the question I'd like to ask you is -- why not?
Why don't we <unk> this way?
Because it makes more sense of everything that I've ever heard to explain the <unk> of the <unk> process.
<unk>, as anyone who ever <unk> to do something -- so, so, basically, everybody here -- knows, it's <unk>.
And, in fact, it can <unk> look completely <unk>.
I did this meeting <unk> with the extraordinary <unk> <unk>, which is now 90 years now, but that was a <unk> for all life and said that during his <unk> <unk>, <unk> in the <unk> <unk>, <unk> out in the <unk> <unk>, <unk> out in the fields, and I <unk> it, within a <unk> <unk>.
He told me that it was like a <unk> <unk>.
And that we were going to go to her from the <unk>.
I could get it, because he was <unk> the land under its feet.
And we had to have one thing to do that point and was of the words, "<unk> as a <unk>."
And so they went to home and <unk> this <unk>, and it wouldn't have to someone else that would have to take a piece of paper and a <unk> enough <unk> to be, and <unk> it on the page.
Sometimes, we couldn't be quick, so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> without able to get to home to <unk> and she would <unk> the <unk> through the <unk>, and she would <unk> through the <unk>, looking, as he said, "another <unk>."
And then there were those times -- this piece of never, and there were some moments where it was <unk>, right?
So, he was coming home and was looking for paper and I was looking for paper and I was <unk> it through, and he had a <unk> right in the while he was <unk>, and he was, that it was like he <unk> with the other hand and <unk>.
It <unk> the <unk> from the tail and the <unk> in his body and the <unk> on the page.
And in these cases, the <unk> would have <unk> on the <unk> page and <unk> but <unk>, on the last word to the first word to the first word to the first word to the first word to the first word to the first.
So when I <unk> it -- it's <unk>, it's exactly <unk> to my <unk> process.
Not a <unk> process -- I'm not a <unk>!
I'm a <unk>, and my way of <unk> is; I love at the same <unk> every day and <unk> and <unk> to work on top of it.
But even me, in my <unk>, I <unk> against that thing, sometimes.
And I'm sure that many of you have the <unk>.
You know, even if the work and ideas would <unk> me from a certain source I couldn't <unk> it.
And what is this thing?
And how can we <unk> it so that we don't have to <unk> your head, but rather, what is it <unk> to us?
As I'm about, the best <unk> example that I have is the <unk> <unk> <unk>, which I've spent several years ago for a <unk>.
I was talking about this, and you know, <unk>, for the <unk> of life is the <unk> of the <unk> artist <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk> these species of <unk> totally <unk>.
But then he was <unk>, and one day when he was <unk> on a <unk> <unk>, he <unk> all for him.
It's going fast and everything of a <unk> <unk> this little <unk> of <unk>, which is in his head as <unk> does the <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, and you want, you know, it's wonderful, and the <unk>, but it doesn't know how to be.
It's not a piece of paper, it doesn't have a <unk>.
So it starts to feel this kind of old <unk> <unk> in him, like, "I'm going to lose, and I'm going to go out of this <unk> song.
I'm not <unk> enough, and I can't <unk> it. "
And instead of going to <unk>, they <unk>.
<unk> the whole <unk> process and made something completely new.
He just <unk> the sky and said, "<unk>, you see I'm <unk>?"
"It seems to you that can write a song now?"
If you really want to <unk>, <unk> <unk> when I can take care of you.
<unk>, <unk> to <unk> else today.
<unk> <unk> <unk>. "
And its <unk> process will <unk> after that.
Not the work, it was still <unk> as always.
But the process, and the <unk> <unk> was <unk> when I was <unk> when I <unk> the <unk>, the <unk> that outside he <unk>, the <unk> that the problems and <unk> it back where it was, that it didn't have to be something that was <unk> and <unk>.
but it was <unk> this <unk>, <unk> <unk> a conversation between <unk> and this <unk> thing that was <unk> and <unk> <unk>, but it wasn't <unk>.
So, how much I was going to change a little bit of how I'm going to go and and already <unk> me once.
This idea, I was <unk> when I was <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and I went to <unk>, and I went into one of those <unk> <unk>, when we're all working on something and we don't do that and you can think it's going to be a <unk>, which is going to be the <unk>.
Not just <unk>, just <unk> book.
And we started thinking about this project.
But then I'm going to <unk> that I was <unk> to <unk> it.
So I <unk> my face up from the <unk> and I <unk> my <unk> to a <unk> <unk> of the room.
And I said to <unk>, "<unk>, what, we know, that if this book is not going to be <unk>, right?
Because as you see, I'm <unk> everything I have, I have no longer about this.
So if you want it to be better, you have to <unk> and do your side.
OK. But if you don't do it, you know what, I'm not going to <unk> anything.
I started writing the same because it's my job.
And I would like to say that I'm sure I'm <unk> to do my part. "Because at the end is so, OK -- <unk> is in the <unk> Africa of North Africa, people <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> to the <unk> <unk>.
And they were always <unk>, because the <unk> were <unk> and <unk>.
But every once a while, something <unk>, and one of these artists actually <unk>.
And I know I'm talking about what you all know, because I know you have seen it, at some point, a kind of <unk>.
It was as if time <unk>, and the <unk> <unk> through a kind of <unk> and it wasn't different than it <unk>, like <unk> <unk> before, but everything <unk>.
And suddenly we don't just <unk> as a human.
But it <unk> up from <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> of <unk>.
And when this <unk>, people <unk> what was, he <unk> it with it.
<unk> your hands and start <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, God," God, "God,"
That's God, you know.
<unk> <unk> -- when the <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the <unk>, I <unk> this <unk> with them and the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, which you can still feel in the <unk> or in <unk>.
In <unk>, when an artist has done something impossible and <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>," <unk>, <unk> -- a <unk> of God.
And it's because we need it.
But the problem comes up the next day, for <unk> itself, when you <unk> and <unk> that are the 11 <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> it of God's no more.
It's just a <unk> <unk> with great <unk>, and perhaps never <unk> to that <unk>.
And perhaps nobody's going to <unk> God's name as it again, and what does it have to do with the rest of his life?
It's hard.
This is one of the most <unk> <unk> to do in a <unk> life.
But it doesn't have to be so <unk> if you can't believe, <unk>, that the most <unk> of your being being come to yourself.
But I just <unk> you that data in <unk> from a <unk> source of this <unk> part of your life that you have to go to somebody else when you're finished.
And, you know, if we think it's this <unk> changes.
And so I started <unk>, and it's what I <unk> for several months during the <unk> <unk>, which was soon <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> of my success.
And what I have to continue to <unk> when I feel that is, I'm not <unk>.
You don't <unk>. You just don't work.
<unk> to <unk> for your side, any of any one can be.
If your work is <unk>, <unk>.
If the <unk>, you'll go to you <unk> <unk> <unk> some kind of <unk>, for one moment through your <unk>, then, "<unk>!"
<unk>, you do the same your <unk>.
And "<unk>!" <unk>! "
I think it's going to be <unk>.
"<unk>!" <unk> "to you, even for having a human love and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk>: <unk>!
As you know, I've already talked about some of these projects on the human genome, what it can <unk> and the discovery of new genes of.
Now we're going to <unk> a new path. We started <unk> biology and now starting to <unk> our digital code, we're <unk> in a new <unk> of biology, <unk> and <unk> life.
We always tried to <unk> great questions.
"What is life?" It's something that many <unk>, I think have <unk> to figure out at various levels.
We tried different <unk>, <unk> to <unk> terms.
We're <unk> for almost 20 years.
When we <unk> the human genome <unk>, we <unk> from <unk> world of biology to the digital world.
Now, do we're going to <unk> life, or create new life from this digital universe?
This is a map of a little <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, which is the species from the <unk> genome between those that can <unk> in the lab.
And we tried to reduce <unk> <unk> the genome to <unk> one even smaller.
We're able to <unk> a <unk> of about 500 that are here.
But when we look at its map, it's simple <unk> to our map.
<unk>, that's simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can <unk>, one at a time, it's very <unk> that can bring a <unk> cell.
So we thought that the only way to <unk> this <unk> was <unk> this <unk> so that we could <unk> the <unk> to <unk> some of these questions.
And so we started the <unk> of "We can <unk> a <unk>?"
Can the chemistry <unk> of making these big molecules that we've never been able to create before?
And what, if we can make a <unk>?
A <unk> is just a piece of <unk> <unk> material.
The speed with which we're able to <unk> life is <unk> <unk>.
Our ability to write the code, which is <unk>, rather slowly, but it's <unk>.
And our <unk> <unk> the results to bring it on a <unk> <unk>.
We spent over 15 years ago.
The process has <unk> a lot of <unk>, <unk> with a <unk> <unk> before they <unk> the early experiments.
But we found that DNA <unk> is very difficult.
There are <unk> of thousands of DNA machines in the world that <unk> small <unk> of DNA, of 30 to 50 <unk> and it's a process. It's a <unk> process: the more <unk> is long, there are.
So we had to develop a new <unk> to <unk> these <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
And this was our first <unk>, starting to <unk> digital information genome of the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's a small virus that <unk> bacteria.
We designed <unk>, we <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> a DNA <unk> of about <unk> <unk>.
And the interesting part is when we took this piece of <unk> <unk> material and we <unk> it in the bacteria, the bacteria have <unk> to read this code and <unk> the <unk> particles.
<unk> particles have been <unk> by cells, they're <unk> back and they <unk> the <unk> <unk>.
I've talked about recently with <unk> members of the <unk> industry that they certainly certainly <unk> this model.
They have more of you.
I think this is a situation where the software can actually build its <unk> in a <unk> system.
But we could do the bigger things.
We had to build the whole <unk> of <unk>.
They're more than <unk> <unk> <unk>.
So we thought we're going to <unk> <unk> <unk>, so that we can change <unk> to understand what the <unk> of a <unk> cell.
<unk> is <unk>, and if we can <unk> information in a computer, it has to be very <unk>.
When we first saw this genome for the first time in <unk> <unk> <unk>, it was a <unk> for every 10 <unk> <unk>.
We found, <unk>, 30 <unk>. If we were using that original sequence, you never have been able to do it work.
One part of the process is designing <unk> <unk> 50 <unk> that <unk> all the other <unk> of 50 <unk> to build smaller <unk> <unk> that <unk> together.
And we're going to have to <unk> elements here.
You've probably read that there's a <unk> <unk>.
So we have a <unk> code on four <unk>: A, <unk>, <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> of those <unk> <unk> <unk> together about 20 <unk>, and there's a <unk> order for every <unk>.
So we can use the code for writing words, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
What we did at the beginning was <unk>.
Some of them were <unk> by the fact that it wasn't <unk>.
We designed these <unk> to <unk> just <unk> <unk> with <unk>.
There are <unk> that we <unk> them and <unk> them.
And we started to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We have made these <unk> <unk> so that we've made <unk>, because we're trying to create a very <unk> <unk>. And because we're going to see in a minute.
We're trying to <unk> the process.
So, this seems to <unk> <unk>.
When we go to these very <unk>, very <unk> than 100 <unk> <unk>, we're not going to get <unk> directly in the <unk> <unk>.
It's <unk> <unk> <unk>.
So we've <unk> some other <unk>.
And we're going to go through a <unk> <unk>, which in biology <unk> to <unk> DNA to <unk> the <unk>.
Here's an example.
This <unk>, called <unk> <unk>, can <unk> three million <unk> <unk>.
You can see in the <unk> <unk> as his <unk> is <unk>.
In 12 -- 24 hours, it's <unk> exactly as it was before.
<unk> thousands of organisms that are able to do that.
These organisms can <unk> completely.
We had to live under <unk>.
I'm absolutely sure that life is <unk> in space, and you're going to find new <unk> of water <unk>.
In fact, NASA showed that this happens.
This is an image of the <unk> that we've built using these <unk>, just using the <unk> with the <unk> design of the <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> them.
This is not <unk> with a <unk> <unk>, but with a <unk> <unk>.
It's such a <unk> <unk> that we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk>.
These are pictures that we have a period of about six seconds.
This is the <unk> we've done little time ago.
They're more than <unk> <unk>.
It's the largest <unk> of a <unk> structure ever <unk> by man.
It's got a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
If we <unk> it with a <unk> 10 <unk>, and we just <unk> pages to <unk> this code.
Now, how do we make it work? How do we <unk>?
<unk>, of course, is a game game <unk>.
It's a little bit more <unk> when you use bacteria.
It's <unk> when it comes to <unk> cells like our <unk>. You can just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> another, which is basically the process of <unk>.
In <unk>, we <unk> the <unk> is instead <unk> in the cell, but we have <unk> <unk> that we're able to make a <unk> <unk> <unk> of a <unk> from a <unk> to another cell to another and <unk>.
We <unk> a <unk> <unk> by a kind of <unk>.
<unk> are just as men from <unk>.
We've <unk> some <unk> <unk> in a more <unk> way that we could decide which to choose this <unk>.
And then he <unk> it up with <unk> so that they <unk> all the <unk>.
And when we put it in the cell was <unk> and we <unk> our <unk> <unk> the new <unk> went into the cell.
And we could <unk> that we won't go beyond it, but we tried to <unk> more in there.
This is one of the major <unk> of evolution.
We found that <unk> species have <unk> a second or a third <unk> somewhere, <unk> in a second thousands of new <unk> to that species.
So those who think about evolution as one <unk> at time it <unk> not so much of the biology.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that DNA.
The <unk> that was in the cell I didn't have one.
The <unk> <unk> we <unk> it.
It's <unk>, and it <unk> the other <unk> as <unk>, <unk> it, and we <unk> with only the cell and the new <unk>.
It's become blue because of the genes we've <unk>.
And in a short time, all of the <unk> of a kind, you've <unk>, and it <unk> of all in a new species, <unk> on the new software that we <unk> in the cell.
All the <unk> are <unk>, and they're <unk>, and when you look at the <unk> code exactly what we've <unk>.
Now, this may seem <unk> <unk>, but we can <unk> the software, we can change things very <unk>.
Now, I've already <unk> that we're not talking about <unk> -- but of progress starting three million years and a half years of evolution, and I already said that we're going to create a new version of the <unk> <unk>, where we're <unk> new species to this digital process.
Why do that?
I think it's pretty <unk> when we think about our <unk>.
We're going to go for six and a half billion people in the next 40 years.
Just to give an example: I was born in <unk>.
Now there are three people on the planet to <unk> in <unk>; in 40 years, there will be four.
We're <unk> problems now to find food, <unk> and <unk>, <unk> and <unk> for six billion people.
We're going to have to do it for nine billion.
<unk> over five billion <unk>, over 30 billion <unk> <unk>.
That means 100 million <unk> a day.
When we're trying to find <unk> <unk>, or any process to <unk>, it will be a huge challenge.
We have to realize that all of the <unk> of CO2 by these materials that we're going to <unk> in the atmosphere.
At the day, because of the <unk> <unk> <unk> around the world, we have a <unk> with about 20 million genes, and I like to think that are <unk> <unk> for the future.
<unk> industry <unk> only one <unk> about <unk>, and think about how many different things are <unk> out.
Our <unk> here is <unk> data from reality and our imagination.
Now we have <unk>, <unk> to these <unk> <unk> <unk>, and we can create what we call <unk> <unk>.
We're able to build a big robot that can produce a million <unk> a day.
Think about <unk> these 20 million genes or <unk> to <unk> <unk> to produce <unk> or <unk>, new <unk>, can change, <unk>, new <unk>, we can change, with a small team, and create more <unk> biology than the last 20 years of science.
And it's just a standard <unk>.
We can choose to <unk> <unk>, <unk> chemistry or <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
This is a <unk> of some software <unk> that we're working on to be able to <unk> and design species to the computer.
Well, we don't know how they will they be.
We know exactly how their code is.
We're now going to <unk> on the <unk> generation.
You've seen that <unk> <unk> was an experiment that was a bad experiment.
We have <unk> second and third generation that we're going to be <unk> <unk> from <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> as the <unk> or different types of <unk>.
But the only way biology can have a big impact without <unk> <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the <unk> would be <unk> CO2 in matter before, so we're working on to design cells that can reach that to make cells that can reach that one of them, and we think we can have the first <unk> generation in about 18 months.
<unk> light <unk> with CO2 is a <unk> but in our <unk> of <unk> in the world, we found different <unk>.
This is a <unk> that we <unk> in <unk>.
<unk> in the ocean, at about <unk> feet of <unk> at the <unk> of the water.
We're <unk> by CO2 using hydrogen <unk> as a source of energy.
We're trying to figure out if we can <unk> CO2, which can be <unk> by <unk>, <unk> that CO2 in <unk>, to drive this process.
So, short, we think that we might be able to <unk> what the basic question, "which is what life is," We, we <unk> the <unk> goal of <unk> the whole <unk> industry.
<unk>. If you can't do it from TED, where can you?
It's going to have a <unk> source of energy.
And we're working for the same <unk> to create <unk> <unk>.
You've seen this year with flu, we're always back a year and with a dollar less when it comes to find the right <unk>.
I think what you can change by building <unk> <unk>.
That's how the future could begin to look <unk>, now, the tree of evolution, <unk> the evolution with bacteria <unk>, <unk>, <unk> cells.
We're so much to <unk> people.
Our purpose is to make it so that we live enough to try to <unk> them. Thank you very much.
So, I'm going to show you, the <unk> possible, some fundamental work, of new technology that we brought to <unk> <unk> <unk> to a <unk> almost a year ago. That's <unk>.
It's a environment in which you can <unk> both <unk> at a huge amount of data.
And we're seeing <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with a kind of <unk> <unk> and <unk>, for a quick <unk>, <unk> <unk> the images as we want.
And it doesn't matter how big the amount of information that we see, how big <unk> are, or data <unk>.
Most of them are <unk> photographs, but this is a <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of <unk>, and they <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It doesn't make any difference because it's the only thing that you <unk> a system like this is the number of <unk> on your screen at any time. It's also a very <unk> architecture.
This is a whole book, example, data, I'm not about images.
This is the <unk> <unk>. Every <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk>.
And so it's about <unk> and not about images, we can do something like this, to actually get really to see that it's a real <unk>, not a picture.
It could be a little bit <unk> to read a book.
I'm not going to <unk> you.
This is an <unk> example. This is a number of <unk>.
Every picture is the beginning of a <unk>.
And it really gives you the <unk> and the beautiful experience of the real version of a <unk> or a <unk>, which is for nature <unk> a kind of a <unk>, which is for nature <unk>.
We also did something with the corner of this particular number of the <unk>.
We created a <unk> <unk> <unk> much higher than what you use in a normal <unk>, and we <unk> you of the content.
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk>, you can see it here.
Or some <unk>, or even <unk> <unk>.
And this really <unk> some of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of space on the screen.
I think this <unk> <unk> to <unk> and other <unk> similar, we can't have to be <unk>.
Of course, <unk> is one of the most <unk> <unk> for this kind of technology.
And I don't want to lose time, if not say that we have <unk> <unk> to <unk>.
These are all the streets in the U.S. <unk> above a NASA <unk>.
So now we're going to do something else.
This is actually live on the Web; you can see it.
It's a project called <unk>, which <unk> two different technologies.
One is <unk> and the other is a <unk> <unk> computer computer <unk>, which is a <unk> <unk>, a student of the <unk> of Washington, with the help of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And it's alive in the Web, <unk> <unk>.
You can <unk> when we do this kind of <unk>, where we can go from a picture to the other and have this kind of experience <unk> <unk>.
But the <unk> <unk> of the images here has actually <unk>.
<unk> <unk> of the computer <unk> these images together, so that they can <unk> to the <unk> places where the <unk> all <unk> <unk> to the <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> have been <unk>. Here you see some <unk> of a <unk> or <unk>, and these things have been <unk> at the <unk> level.
I don't know if I have time to show you some other environment.
There are much more <unk>.
I want to go directly to one of the <unk> data, and this is going to go from a <unk> <unk> <unk> that we've done for the first time, I <unk> to show you what <unk> is really the key to behind this technology, the <unk>. And it's not <unk> so <unk> to <unk> <unk> that we've got in the website.
We had to <unk> some of the <unk> <unk> and out of the <unk> <unk> and out of it.
This is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> images. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> images of types in <unk>, other <unk> and so on. So, <unk> of these <unk> <unk>, and so on. And so on. So, we're going to <unk> this model is discovered.
So they're all <unk> images and you're all <unk> <unk> at the <unk> level like this.
And it's possible to <unk> this <unk> way.
You know, I would never have thought of, to work for <unk>.
It's very <unk> to <unk> this kind of <unk> here.
I think we're going to see that it's a lot of different <unk>: from those cell phones, a <unk> number, <unk> together in this environment.
And if I can, I can help you look for those <unk>.
A lot of people have <unk>, etc.
And I'm somewhere here is a series of photographs -- <unk>.
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We can go from <unk> to the physical view of this environment.
The point is that we can do things with the social environment. Now this is <unk> data from <unk> <unk> from the whole memory of how we <unk> the Earth, from the whole memory of <unk> <unk> and <unk> all that data together.
All those pictures become <unk> together, more than the <unk>.
You have a model of the Earth that you get there.
Think about this as the <unk> of <unk> <unk>'s work on Earth.
It's something that <unk> in <unk> complexity as people <unk>, and that they will <unk> for the people who are <unk> <unk> with the use.
Their <unk> are <unk> with <unk> <unk> by other people.
If somebody comes to <unk> all these <unk> <unk> the name, my <unk> picture of <unk> <unk> <unk> all of that data, and I can use it as a <unk> <unk> to <unk> in that space, in that <unk>, by using the <unk> of anyone else, and having a social experience of <unk> and <unk>.
Of course, a <unk> of all of this is very <unk> models of the Earth, <unk> not only, <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> images and <unk> and <unk>, but from <unk> <unk>.
Thank you very much.
CA: I realized? What do you have to do is that at some point, in the next years, all the <unk> <unk> for the next years, all of them are <unk> by anyone in the world's world basically <unk> together?
<unk>: Yes. What's doing is basically <unk>.
It's making <unk>, if you want, between images.
And it's doing it at the content of images.
And what it becomes very interesting if you think of <unk> information that a lot of these images will be.
As you do a <unk> of images on the Web, you get a <unk> and the <unk> on the Web has a lot of information about images.
Now, what happens if that picture <unk> all your picture?
So the amount of <unk> <unk> and the amount of <unk> <unk> that's going to be <unk>. It's a <unk> effect of the network.
CA: <unk>, it's really incredible. <unk>.
<unk>: I'm going to <unk> you a lot.
One of the major <unk> when you <unk> and one of the research <unk> is that we can live in the <unk> <unk>, including the past in the wind, the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk>, <unk> it in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
I think that <unk> <unk> <unk> still <unk> over the <unk> <unk>, or the <unk> <unk> are still <unk> <unk> <unk>, or <unk>, <unk> <unk> still <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> still the <unk> of <unk>, to <unk> the central <unk>, and that the idea that the world in which the world in which we live in in a sense, but it's just a model of the <unk> of the world that we're not in fact, there is a <unk> model of the <unk> of the <unk>,
the <unk> of a particular <unk> of <unk> choices that our <unk> has done, good or bad, a lot of <unk>.
And, of course, everybody was <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>. Everybody <unk>.
We're <unk> to <unk>.
We have to deal with the <unk> of death, so we don't know whether we <unk> and <unk> --
We all have a art.
What we're going to find is the <unk> of the song, the <unk> of the <unk> of every culture.
It doesn't matter whether it's the <unk> of the <unk>, or the <unk> of <unk> <unk>, or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, or <unk> <unk> <unk>, or a <unk> in the <unk> <unk>.
He was my <unk> of a <unk> journey in <unk> a month ago, or a <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>'s mother's <unk>.
All of these <unk> us that there are other ways of to think, other ways to think, other ways to move in the world.
And if you take a minute, it's a concept that can give you hope.
<unk>, the <unk> of the world create a <unk> of <unk> life and <unk> that will <unk> the planet and it's important for the <unk> of the planet and is important for the <unk> of the planet as the <unk> <unk>.
And you can think of this <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and you can <unk> the amount of <unk>, dreams, <unk>, <unk>, ideas, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> to be from the human imagination from the human imagination from the human imagination of consciousness.
<unk> is the fantastic <unk> of humanity.
It's the <unk> of what we are and what we can be as as <unk> species.
And <unk> the <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> and <unk> much <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, for example, I think that 50 percent of all species is or is on the <unk> of <unk>, because it's just <unk>, or <unk> -- in the <unk> of <unk> diversity -- and you don't even <unk> to the <unk> <unk> -- that of the <unk> diversity -- and you don't even <unk> -- that's the <unk> of the <unk> diversity.
The <unk> of this is, of course, the <unk> <unk>.
When you're <unk> <unk> <unk> on this planet.
A <unk> is not just a <unk> or a series of rules <unk>.
A language is the <unk> of the human spirit.
It's the medium that it <unk> of every culture <unk> into the material.
Every language is a forest of the mind, a <unk>, a <unk>, a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And of those <unk> <unk>, as we're sitting here in <unk>, at least half not <unk> is more <unk> in the <unk> of children.
They're no longer <unk> to children, which means unless we <unk> something, which is already death.
What's more <unk> than the <unk>, of being <unk>, to be the last to talk to a language, to have not a way to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> or <unk> the children's <unk>?
This <unk> <unk> is a few weeks, <unk> <unk>, and <unk> in every two weeks, every two weeks: every two weeks, a <unk> <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> <unk> of a <unk> language.
And I know that somebody of you know, "<unk>'t that?
The world would not be a better place if we could <unk> the same language? "<unk>, then we all talk to you. <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>.
<unk> of a <unk> thing is, that it means not to <unk> your language.
I'd like to make you a journey through the <unk> --
a small journey in the <unk> to give you a <unk> of what we're <unk>.
Many of us will know that when I say, "I mean," I really mean, "I really mean different ways to <unk>.
So, for example, this <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, the <unk> of the <unk>, which <unk> to the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's a <unk> that it's not able to <unk> the blue color from green because the <unk> time is <unk> in the forest, where the <unk>.
They have a <unk> language and a rule, <unk> <unk>. <unk>: you have to <unk> a person talking to a different language.
And all of this <unk> in the past <unk>, but the <unk> is that these <unk> families <unk> where they talk to six or seven <unk> because of the <unk> <unk> <unk> no <unk>.
You start listening to and then we'll start talking about.
I was one of the most interesting <unk> that I lived with, the <unk> <unk>, an incredible <unk> that had the first <unk> in <unk>.
In <unk>, five <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
They made <unk> photographs that <unk> them in <unk> <unk> <unk>, which was <unk>, <unk> that this <unk> of the <unk> forest <unk> never seen anything.
They <unk> the picture of the ground, they <unk> them to find a form or <unk> and, they didn't know, they <unk> <unk> <unk>, and they <unk> the five <unk> <unk> with the <unk>.
But <unk> don't just <unk> them.
They <unk> to each other.
<unk> percent <unk> was <unk> by themselves.
We went to eight <unk> and we found two <unk> death, and when we <unk> to know, they <unk> that one of them was <unk> so that they <unk> died, and then <unk> it. And so, they had <unk> the same.
<unk> were able to recognize the animal <unk> 40 <unk> and to <unk> the species.
I was early '<unk>, I was <unk> a very interesting task when my <unk> <unk> <unk> me if I wanted to go to <unk> me if I wanted to go to <unk> between <unk> society and <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, and <unk> of <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk> to do <unk>.
To make sense of <unk>, I should have understanding <unk> culture and that <unk> isn't <unk> <unk>.
It's pretty much about a <unk> view of the world.
Very interesting.
If you're going to <unk> the great <unk> of the world, what would you like to me?
<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, etc.
A continent is always <unk> out of it, thinking that Africa doesn't have <unk> <unk>. And instead, it's not the <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk>.
What makes interesting is the <unk> relationship between life and death.
So <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> can be <unk> by <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> in the alive in a way that for a short moment the <unk> becomes the <unk>.
So, for this <unk> to say, "<unk> go to <unk>."
We <unk> in the <unk> and <unk> God. "
And since you're <unk>, is the spirit that <unk> you, how do you get you <unk>?
So they <unk> to these incredible events: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a very strong <unk> of the power of the mind in the body when it's <unk> in a state of <unk> <unk>.
I've lived all the <unk> with which I've lived the most <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, in <unk> <unk>.
<unk> of the <unk> civilization is that once <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
In a blood continent, this <unk> never been <unk> by <unk>.
I'm <unk> today, I'm <unk> by a <unk>, but their education is extraordinary.
<unk> <unk> <unk> from <unk> families to four years, and they live <unk> in a world fact that they're <unk> in a world <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> to <unk> the base for 18 years.
Two <unk> of nine years <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
For all this time, they're <unk> to their <unk> society, values that <unk> their <unk> and just their <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or to say <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or to say <unk> <unk>.
At the end of this incredible <unk>, they're <unk> out and for the first time in them, at 18 years, see a <unk>. And in that moment of the first <unk>, when the sun <unk> <unk> <unk>, everything that they have learned in theory, everything that they've learned in a theory of his <unk>. <unk> does a <unk> <unk> in all his <unk>. <unk> does a <unk> <unk> <unk>. And he says, "
"<unk>?" I'm going to tell you.
It's <unk>. Now it's going to be <unk>. "
They call <unk> <unk> and they say that we, <unk> <unk>, we are the <unk> of the world's <unk>.
This is an <unk> level of important.
When we think about <unk> <unk> and the <unk> environment and the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, which is a <unk> concept in its <unk> or maybe <unk>, and we say that these <unk> are <unk> to the Earth.
<unk> <unk> are not <unk> or <unk> <unk>.
There is no space for these things in the <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk>, but because of time and <unk>, have created a <unk> of the Earth <unk> <unk> not on a <unk> <unk> <unk>. It's not about the concept <unk> <unk>. It's a <unk> <unk>, the concept that the Earth can only live only because it's <unk> by the human consciousness.
What does that mean?
I mean that a <unk> of the <unk> that we'll <unk> that the mountain is a <unk> spirit that <unk> its <unk> will be a <unk> <unk> different human being, and will have a very <unk> different <unk>, and will have a very well relationship to the mountain or that <unk> is a <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk>.
What's interesting is the <unk> that <unk> the relationship between <unk> and natural world.
I grew up in the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> that the <unk> <unk> to be <unk>.
That made me a human being <unk> different from my friends who believe that <unk> are the <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> that live in the <unk> <unk>.
If we can <unk> that these <unk> can create reality, different, we can begin to understand some of their <unk> <unk>. They will <unk> this <unk>.
I <unk> this picture in <unk> in the <unk> <unk>.
Maybe some of you have heard about <unk>, the most powerful <unk> of the <unk> <unk>.
What makes <unk> is not the <unk> potential of <unk>, but its <unk>. It's <unk> by two elements.
On one hand, this <unk> <unk> <unk> a series of <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk>.
<unk> the only one <unk> has a <unk> <unk> that <unk> a little bit of <unk>, but it's <unk> with the <unk> of a <unk>'s family <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This <unk> has <unk> <unk>, very similar to <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
If you're going to see the <unk> <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, which is <unk> <unk>.
It's like that <unk> on the <unk> is a little bit like being <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a sea of electricity. It doesn't make a <unk> of reality of reality.
I often went with my <unk>, Richard <unk> <unk>, the man who <unk> the <unk> was <unk>, with its discovery of the <unk> <unk> <unk> in the '<unk>.
And so, in my <unk> can't <unk> these <unk>, as you can't tell anyone to be <unk>. <unk>, but they can't be <unk> because they're <unk> by a <unk> that's <unk>, because they're <unk> by a <unk> that's of course in <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
It's possible to <unk> only if we <unk> with other <unk> <unk> that <unk>.
Now, the <unk> is the <unk> that are in this <unk> are <unk> <unk>, the same kind of necessary for <unk> <unk>. <unk> question: in a <unk> <unk> <unk>, in a <unk> <unk> species of plants, like these <unk> <unk> <unk>, two <unk>, not similar, but that if you <unk> in this way, they create a <unk> <unk> that is the <unk> of the <unk>?
We use the great <unk> of <unk> and <unk>, which can <unk>.
But if we were to <unk>, we're going to <unk> us, "<unk>," <unk>, "<unk>," <unk>, "<unk> we talk."
What does that mean?
This <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, who <unk> <unk> in the forest, and that our eyes will <unk> in the forest itself.
If they <unk> their <unk> <unk> us, "<unk>" <unk> "<unk>" <unk> "<unk>" <unk> "No."
The solution is: you take the <unk> <unk> in a night night filled with a different <unk>.
And you don't <unk> to <unk>, but it's much more interesting than <unk> <unk>.
Now, the problem is that even those of us who have heart <unk> <unk> them, but somehow <unk> to the <unk> of the history of respect to our real world, and <unk> it.
In fact, the <unk> century, <unk> 300 years, <unk> <unk> for its <unk> or its <unk> <unk>, but rather as the one of which we <unk> and <unk> <unk> or <unk> the mass <unk> of the diversity and <unk> of the planet. Now the problem is not the change.
All the <unk> through the <unk> have been <unk> in a <unk> for new possibilities of life.
And the problem is not technology.
<unk> <unk> have no <unk> to be <unk> when they put <unk> <unk> and <unk> as much as the <unk> have <unk> <unk> to be <unk> when they put <unk> and <unk>.
It's not the change or technology that <unk> the <unk> of <unk>. It's the power.
The <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And if you look at the world, we'll see that these are not <unk> <unk>.
They're <unk> creatures and they're <unk> <unk> creatures that are <unk> creatures that go beyond their <unk> ability.
<unk> <unk> <unk> --
a <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, a <unk> that has lived free free in the forest until a generation ago, and now we go to the <unk> and the <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk>, where you can see the <unk> <unk> from the <unk> that it looks <unk> away from the <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> <unk> <unk>,
<unk> <unk> with the <unk> <unk> to the forest.
Or, in <unk> case, they're disease disease <unk> with the <unk> discovery.
If we <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk>, where I'm doing a lot of research, you'll see the <unk> of the political <unk>.
As a <unk> <unk>, <unk> physics of a <unk>, is <unk> at the <unk> level, but <unk>, <unk>, the <unk> of <unk> life of a <unk>, not only is it <unk>, but <unk> in certain <unk>, because it's part of the development <unk>.
And you can't understand the <unk> of the <unk> until you're part of the beginning.
I <unk> <unk> miles from <unk> in the Western China, through the <unk> <unk>, <unk> to <unk> with a young <unk>, but only it <unk> to <unk>. I realized what's behind the <unk> that we're talking about.
<unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> million people <unk> from the <unk> <unk>.
The father of this guy was <unk> to the <unk> <unk>.
which means that it's been <unk> in the <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
My mother was <unk> and his <unk> was to be <unk>.
It was taken of <unk> in <unk> at age two years, under its <unk> because he couldn't have to live without him.
<unk>, who did the same, was <unk> in <unk>.
One day, she <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> for this <unk>, was <unk> to the <unk> jobs for seven years.
<unk> <unk> can be <unk>, but the <unk> <unk> is <unk>.
And so, it all <unk> to a choice.
Do we live in the <unk> world, or we want to <unk> the <unk> world of diversity?
The great <unk> <unk>, before he died said that his greatest fear was that his greatest fear was that, in our going to go to this <unk> view of the world, not just <unk> the whole <unk> of human imagination to a <unk> <unk> of thinking, but there were other possibilities.
And it's <unk> to remember that our species is <unk> for <unk> years.
The <unk> <unk>, which has given us agriculture, which has <unk> us to the <unk> of the <unk>, <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> with the <unk> of the <unk>, creating the <unk> of <unk>, and we talk about <unk> years ago.
<unk> world has <unk> 300 years old.
That <unk> story, I didn't tell me that we have the answers to all the challenges that we can face in <unk> to come.
When we <unk> <unk> of the world is asked what it means to be human, we'll start to say, with different <unk> <unk>.
And it's in these answers that we all <unk> the possibility of being what we're: a <unk> species, which has to make all <unk> and all the <unk> can <unk>. And there are great moments of <unk>.
I <unk> this picture on the <unk> <unk> of <unk>, when I went to <unk> <unk> with <unk>, and this man, <unk> me the wonderful story of his <unk>.
The <unk> government was not always <unk> with the <unk> <unk> and in the '<unk> for <unk> our <unk>, we <unk> them in <unk>.
The <unk> of this man is <unk>.
The family, <unk> for his life, <unk> all the <unk>, and all of his <unk>.
You should know that <unk> don't <unk> the cold, we'll find that <unk>.
The <unk> of <unk> fish were made of <unk> fish <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> of this man didn't <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk>.
It's <unk> away, it <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> in your hand. When I did it, they <unk> it by their <unk>. When I made it, they <unk> them up, they <unk> them up a <unk>.
It <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk> <unk> and when <unk> <unk>, he <unk> a dog.
It <unk> the dog and created a <unk>, with the <unk> <unk> created a <unk>, <unk> another dog and <unk> on the <unk>, <unk> <unk> in <unk>.
Do you have to talk to anything?
<unk> <unk> the <unk> government <unk> the total <unk> of an area <unk> <unk> of an area larger <unk> in California and <unk> together.
It's their new <unk>. It's called <unk>.
It's a <unk> <unk>. It's <unk> all the resources.
One <unk> example of how a <unk> can <unk> with his <unk>.
And, to end, I think it's pretty <unk> at least to those <unk> <unk> of us is in these <unk> <unk> areas of the planet, they realize that they're not at all.
For somebody is home.
<unk> <unk> of the human imagination that we're going to <unk> <unk>. And for all of us, the dreams of these children, like the dreams of our children, become part of the <unk> hope.
And so, we're <unk> <unk> that <unk> have never been at all.
I thought the <unk> --
<unk> they're not <unk>, but we believe that stories can change the world, and perhaps we are the best <unk> to tell the stories of the world. Every month our website <unk> <unk> million <unk>.
<unk> <unk> our <unk> <unk>.
Our <unk> are <unk> by millions of people.
Our work is <unk> in <unk> to bring our public in places to bring our public in places to <unk> our public <unk> <unk>. <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> for <unk> <unk>, and <unk>, <unk> for <unk>, and time <unk> for a <unk> world, and we have to find a <unk> <unk> in a <unk> world.
that the <unk> of all <unk> can <unk> to our <unk> <unk>.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book, which I hope is you already heard and <unk> to <unk> some <unk>, in case we're not going to <unk> them.
I want to start with what I call the <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> of what?
<unk> <unk> of all <unk> society. <unk> <unk> <unk>: "If we want to <unk> the <unk> of our citizens," The way to do it is to <unk> freedom. "
And it's why it's on one side, in fact that freedom, is <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> for humans.
On the other one is where we're <unk>, each of us can act to <unk>, to do everything that we will <unk> our <unk>, without any of them in the name of our.
The way to <unk> the freedom is to <unk> choice.
The more choices are, the more <unk>, and the more of them are <unk>, the <unk>, the greater is their <unk>.
This, <unk>, it's so <unk> <unk> in the society that nobody <unk> to <unk> in <unk>.
And it's also <unk> <unk> in our lives.
I'm going to show you some examples of what progress made possible.
This is my <unk>. It's not that big.
I got a simple note about <unk> to <unk>.
In my <unk>, there are <unk> <unk>, without <unk> the 10 <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> and 12 <unk> <unk> you can buy for a huge number of <unk> in the <unk> <unk> that nobody of <unk> already <unk> is your <unk>.
That's what <unk> is how the <unk>.
Then you go to the <unk> store for buy a <unk>: <unk>, <unk>, radio, <unk>, <unk>, radio, <unk>, <unk>.
And in this single <unk> store, there's a big number of <unk> <unk>.
We can make six and a half million different <unk> using the <unk> that there are in just a store.
It turns out there is <unk> choice.
<unk> fields: the world of <unk>.
Once, when I was a child, you could get all the <unk> services, <unk> that were <unk> by <unk> <unk>.
They <unk> the phone, you don't <unk> it.
And so, one of that, by the way, was that the phone never <unk>.
These days, they went.
Now we have a <unk> almost <unk> <unk>, especially between cell phones.
Here's cell phones from the future.
My <unk> is in the middle, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, and <unk> for <unk> <unk>.
If you don't have it yet seen in the <unk> store under your house, you're very certain you're going to get.
And what is happening at the end of it is that people <unk> and ask this question, and you know, what is the answer is, "No.
It's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn't make things.
So, in other <unk> of life that are much more important than <unk>, they're <unk> the same <unk> of choices.
<unk> <unk>: It doesn't happen in the United States you're going to go from the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> you what you have to do.
Instead, <unk> from the <unk>, and the <unk> says, "OK, we could do A, or <unk>," A, "or <unk>," A, "<unk> has these <unk> and these <unk>. What do you want to do?"
You asked them, "<unk>, what do you do?"
And the <unk> says, "<unk> has these <unk> and these <unk>, and <unk> has these <unk> and <unk> <unk>."
"What do you want to do?"
And you would ask, "What would you know if she was me, what would you do?"
And the <unk> said, "I'm not her."
The result we call it "<unk> <unk>", "<unk>", "<unk> <unk>."
But it's not that one <unk> the weight and the responsibility of making decisions about something that is, <unk> the <unk>, to somebody who who doesn't know, and it's certainly <unk> -- and it's certainly not <unk> to make the patient.
There's a huge <unk> of <unk> products, <unk> to people like me and you, that if you think about it is no sense, because we can't <unk>.
But if we can't <unk>, why do we <unk>?
The answer is they want you to <unk> what we call the <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And so, as fundamental, as our <unk> is now a matter of choice, as you see in this <unk>. "We don't want to <unk>. We don't want to <unk> children. We don't want to <unk>.
And we can <unk> how many times we will.
which means that any <unk> <unk>, you have to decide what kind of person you want to be.
It's going to go to the family and <unk>, and it was that it was <unk> to be <unk> as soon as possible, and they <unk> to make the <unk> as soon as possible.
The only real choice was with those who, not, and even what to do after.
<unk>, it's really to play.
They're <unk> to very smart, and they <unk> 20 percent less work respect for a time.
And not because they're <unk>, not because they're <unk> <unk>.
But why they're <unk>, and I'm going to ask <unk>, "<unk> or not?"
"<unk>, are going to be going to think about how career or <unk>?"
They're <unk> <unk>.
And they're trying to answer these questions, even if this <unk> doesn't <unk> the <unk> that you can't get a nice <unk> to my <unk>.
And they have to do that. They're important questions.
Now, the work: we're <unk>, as <unk> <unk>, because technology <unk> us to work on every minute, every day, every day, every day, every day, every day, every single single single one day, <unk> that the <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, there's a <unk>, and I'm not going to tell you where the <unk> works.
I'm not telling you, because I want to use it.
What does this incredible is about <unk> of choice that we have about the work? Is that we have to decide, <unk> at any time, if we have to work or not.
We can go to see our son to play <unk>, with a <unk> <unk>, the <unk> in the other, and the <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, on <unk>.
And even if I'm all <unk>, every minute we see our son, <unk> the <unk>, we're also <unk>, "I <unk> to this call?"
"I have to answer this <unk>?" I have to <unk> this letter? "
And even when the answer is no, it makes it a very different experience of your son very different than what would would have been in other conditions.
So, from any part of them, small things and <unk>, <unk>, life is a question of choices.
Once the world was this: <unk>, there were some possibilities, and it was, but it was not a matter of choice.
The world today is <unk> to this: <unk> is, "Is it <unk>," Is it <unk>, or <unk>? "
The answer is <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, we know, so I'm going to talk about <unk>.
We're going to have this choice by two effects, on people.
The first one, <unk>, is that it <unk> instead of <unk>.
With a lot of <unk> between which <unk>, it becomes very difficult to do it.
I'll give you an example of <unk>: a study <unk> <unk> <unk>.
A <unk> has <unk> access, <unk> <unk> <unk>, with about a million <unk> <unk>, with about a million <unk> <unk> in different <unk> companies.
What she found out is that for every 10 <unk> that are <unk>, the <unk> of <unk> <unk> two percent.
<unk> <unk>, there's 10 percent less <unk> than when they're <unk> available. Why?
Because with 50 <unk> between which <unk>, is <unk> difficult to decide, and <unk> it <unk> to <unk>.
And <unk>, and again, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and of course, <unk> never comes.
It's not just that it <unk> <unk> <unk> food for <unk> because they're not going to have enough money, it means that the decision is so <unk> that we also <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
They're not going to be <unk> <unk> <unk> for year from work, which would be well <unk> to <unk>.
So, the <unk> is a <unk> of having bad choices.
And I think we're going to see that world.
"And finally, for <unk>: <unk>, <unk> or <unk>?"
You can actually make the right decision, if it's for <unk>, right?
You don't want to choose the wrong <unk>, and you'll get the wrong <unk>.
So this is the first effect. The second is that even if we can <unk> <unk> and make a choice, at the end, we're less <unk> by the end of how we have been with less <unk> by <unk>.
And that for a number of reasons.
One of them is that with many <unk> <unk>, if you take one and not perfect, it's not perfect, it's easy to imagine that we could make a different choice. And what's happening is that the <unk> <unk> us to <unk> of choice, and the <unk> <unk> by <unk> decision,
even when it was a <unk> decision.
More choices there are, <unk>, <unk> of any <unk> that is <unk> of choice.
<unk>, there is what <unk> call.
Dan <unk> has <unk> very well <unk> as the value that we give things to things that we <unk> with.
<unk>, when you get to get the <unk> of them, it's easy to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and being less than the <unk> <unk>.
Here's an example. I'm going to leave with all the ones that are not in New York.
But that's what we probably do.
There's this <unk> to <unk>.
A place of <unk>.
<unk>. <unk> day. It's all about them.
I'm not going to do anything. But what he thinks is, "Well, <unk>."
"All my <unk> <unk> are away."
"<unk> <unk> right in front of the house."
And it's going to spend two weeks from the idea that's coming -- every day -- the possibility of <unk> where it wants.
<unk> <unk> for what we have, even when choice was <unk>.
And the more of them are the <unk> that we have to <unk>, the more <unk> <unk> you against how to <unk>.
Here's another example.
This <unk> tells us a lot of things.
It's about living the moment, and perhaps the <unk> slowly.
But the most important point is that anything you want, you're going to <unk>, you're not doing other.
The things that don't know many <unk> that can make less <unk> what we do.
<unk> <unk>.
I tried to my skin <unk> a new <unk> of <unk>.
It's going to be <unk>.
Once the <unk> were just one guy, <unk> them and <unk> them <unk>, they were <unk>, and they just <unk>, after <unk> <unk> a life and lots of times, they started going well.
So, I went to <unk> a couple of when the <unk> went, and I said, "I need a couple of <unk>, this is my <unk>."
And the <unk> said to me, "Do you want to <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>?"
Do you want them to <unk> or <unk>? "
"Do them want to <unk>?"
"<unk> <unk> them wants to <unk> or <unk>? <unk> <unk> <unk>.
I was <unk>, and after a little bit I was able to say, "I want the one of the guy who was," he had no idea what was, so for an hour, I <unk> all of <unk> <unk> <unk>, and then I would <unk> <unk>, and then I <unk> out of the <unk> I had ever had.
It was <unk>. With all that choice I had <unk> the best.
But it <unk> me.
Why? I wrote a book for <unk>.
And the reason I was worse is that with all that choice my <unk> were <unk>, the <unk> <unk> to be <unk>.
I had <unk> <unk>. I didn't know anything about <unk> when I just <unk> one guy, but when I was 100 different, it <unk>, it had to be perfect.
And what I had <unk> was good, but I didn't perfect.
After I <unk> that we <unk> with what I was <unk> in <unk>.
The <unk> of <unk> in life, people don't make the <unk> that these <unk> to the <unk> themselves.
And this <unk> <unk>, even when the results are good.
<unk> in the world of <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Because if I <unk> it, I'm not talking about what I'm talking about.
The truth is more <unk> to this.
"And he was better when he was worse." The reason why he was better when he was worse was that when he was worse, he was possible to <unk> <unk>.
<unk>, in the world that we live in -- <unk>, <unk> citizens with the <unk> of <unk> -- the <unk> that we can <unk> is that things are <unk> to the <unk>.
You never have to <unk> <unk> because your <unk>, my <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
The <unk> of happiness -- what you're here -- is, "<unk> <unk>" Yes, "you want it."
I mean -- small moment <unk> -- that I'm really <unk> and my wife is really <unk>.
I couldn't do better, I couldn't <unk>.
But <unk> doesn't always <unk>.
I mean, a <unk> of <unk> <unk> when there's just that kind of <unk> is that when you're not <unk>, and you "" Why? "
"Who is <unk>?" The answer is <unk>.
The world is <unk>. What could I do?
When there are hundreds of <unk>, and you'll get one <unk>, and I'll tell you who's the <unk>, it's clear that the <unk> you are.
They could do better.
And there are not <unk> available, there are no <unk> for <unk>.
So when people make decisions, even if the result is <unk>, they're <unk> <unk> and give them to them as well.
In the last few years, is <unk> in the <unk> world.
I think a <unk> <unk> -- not the only one, but important -- of this <unk> <unk> is that people have experiences because <unk> are too <unk>.
And when they have to <unk> this situation they think that <unk> is them.
So the final result is that in general is that in general, but we're going to get worse.
Let me show you.
This is the <unk> <unk>, what we're going to take for it and it's completely <unk>. It's not true.
There's no <unk> that a little choice is better than <unk>, but at all, by this is not going to <unk> that much more of choice is better than a little bit.
There's a <unk> value, <unk>. I don't know what it is.
But I'm quite sure we've been <unk> by a piece of the way the choices <unk> our lives.
Now, from a <unk>'s point of view -- I almost finished -- from a <unk>'s point of view, <unk> is <unk>.
What it allows all this choice to <unk> society is <unk> material.
There are many places in the world, and you'll be <unk> <unk>, where the problem isn't they have <unk> choice.
The problem is they have too <unk>.
So the <unk> I'm talking about is a <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> society.
And what it's doing is <unk> and <unk> is this: <unk> <unk> <unk> you yesterday of how much those <unk> and <unk> <unk> to <unk> are <unk>. It's a <unk> of money.
I mean that these choices, <unk> and <unk>, is not that just <unk>.
They're <unk> <unk>.
They make us worse.
If a little bit of what we would have to have <unk> choice to be <unk> in those where people have too much <unk>, it would not be their life to <unk>, but also our <unk>.
This is what <unk> call a <unk> <unk>.
A <unk> of income is good at all -- not just to the poor -- because of this choice in <unk> that we <unk>.
And so I'll <unk>, "<unk>, you can become everything you want to --
<unk>, people of culture, <unk>: "What's going to do that fish?"
"It's <unk> you can't make anything in a <unk> of glass."
"A <unk>, a <unk> view of the world --"
and I <unk> it like this, at the beginning.
But then, I realized that that fish knows the long <unk> is that that fish knows the long.
Because the reality of <unk> is that if you <unk> the <unk>, so that "is," you can't <unk> the freedom. You <unk> the <unk>.
If you look at the <unk> so that it would be possible to <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, and we <unk> <unk>.
They all need a <unk>.
This is almost certainly too <unk>, perhaps even for the fish, and certainly certainly for us.
But the <unk> of a few <unk> <unk> is a <unk> for <unk> and <unk>, for <unk>.
Thank you very much.
