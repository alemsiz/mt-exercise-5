I just showed these devices I showed these devices to show that the calotic actic, which is about three million years had the size of 48 US S Cental in the 408 US Cental of the 40-percent.
But this subvalue of the gravity of the problem because it doesn't explain the ice problem.
The calot-hotter calotic is in a sense, the heart heart of the climate system
You go and go and you get the waves and return into the summer of the summer
The next next devices is going to be a rapid for the last 25 years.
The ice lost of the signed in the red remarkable in the red of the remarkable
As you see, you go to the blue blue blue of the blue
That's the ice in invernal inversus of extinct.
You can see that the ice of the same thing that the same thing is like the healthy, which is like the healthy of the body.
In 25 years of it was going to be like this.
This is a problem because the re-scale problem is the rate of the ocean and the ocean of the ocean of carbon and the amount of carbon and they go into the microbate from microbes.
And I think about the totality of the inquination of the inheric initial of the amount of of the inquest of this point of not report.
In a few deep deep in Alaska meter is already reboaring from water.
The professorous Katey Walter of Alaska was was a very very high pressed with a little bit last last last last last last last last detect last detect of the University of the University of Alaska was a very very quickly.
Vide: Wow! Al Gor: Look is if we will be well.
A reason is that this scale of the termic surgeon Groenland, from the north.
This is a folume to the glacial record.
And the portraised to the side.
This is the Kangerlussua's Kangerlussudden.
If you want to know how the sal level to the sea ice of the ice of the ice of the ice is where the mart.
These are increasing are increasing very quickly.
In the other part of the planet -- Antarcticle, the greatest block of the planet.
The month of the scientists have been clearning that the bizar's in negative negative and that Antartide eye on some of the sought on some isole of the sun, is particularly rapid in the money.
Equid six feet of water, like in Groenland in Groenland,
Sll: Himalaya, the third biggest block of ice ice ice -- you see new laghi, who were ice ice ice --
40-percent of the world's population was going to be half the water from what the money.
Sep: This ice is the source of the water is the source of the water water of the water of this city.
The portraised is increased.
But when he dimine -- the same happens.
In California needed on the Sierra Nevada is deminute of 40-percent.
The hydrogen is in crisis.
The previsions, you know, I am I grave.
The growing growing in the world door to a not-hauthor account of the incens.
The environmental is increase in the normal and the normal outside of the normal and without precedents.
Those sometimes more numbers in the last 30 years of the precedently 75.
This is a game of all insustainable.
If you look at the context of the historical context if you can see the consequences.
In the last five years we added 70 million tons of CO2 hours -- 25 million tons in the oceans every day.
Look at the Pacific, the area of the Pacific, from Amer, and in the Indian Indian Indian Indian continent where there is a radical rootal of the oceans.
The greatest because of the global warming global warming, which is 20-percent, is the use of the cost of the delivers are maying.
The oil, is a problem, and the carbon is even worse.
The United States are one of the two countries with China.
And it was propond of building a lot of carbon carbon.
But we're assisting a change.
These are the projects in the last years and some demonstrate of alternative demon.
And every way, there is a lot of politics in our Paese Paese
The carbon and the carbon and oil has spent 250 million dollars in the last year, for promoent carbon is a high high level of the carbon is a hossimore.
Those image I remember something.
I know Natal, in Tennesped, where I live, there was a 3.8 billion pounds of the carbon of the scories of carbon.
You may be seen on the news.
This is the second second biggest fairly of scories in America.
It's happened around Nata.
The advertia of the industries of the industries of carbon was this:
Vide: You know, Frosty the carbonaio is a kind of hallef and happy.
It's abundant here in America, and it makes our economy.
Frosty the carbonaio is always more than it is.
It's good for the preze, and the workers and the work work work and the work work are thinking.

For this our priority is to invest a lot of money in a high high high amount of money in a real real force and make a public versus and conconsummer and conconsummer and the truth of the extract of the world's priority to be a lot of money in a real real real time.
In fact, the carbon is not sport.
We think it's a good -- it has also a good profum.
So you don't pret the change of climate change here.
Let me do us.
Vide: Attor: Carbone can be -- you heard a lot of it.
So I do do do you a whole structure of the sea as much as it is the carbon on the carbon the carbon the carbon of the carbon the carbon the carbon the carbon on the carbon on the carbon on the sex.
Straordinary machines are a little rounded by the sound of the technology of the carbon technology of carbon the carbon and the power of the carbon the basis.
The main consummer is between the main the major cause, but the night-scale technology that you see it change.

Now, there's a new new -- you can make a new solution for ushs.
Real of the power of energy energy in 10 years.
A plan to put the work, to make us more several to the work, and help us to help us to stop the re-scale and help the global warming.
So the remarkable solutions that basts to solve our problems.
Sememy of the more.
Al Gor: This is the ultimate ultim.

Al Gor: A old proverbio African old hand you want to go to speaking and go to the time.
If you want to go back to the hand go together."
We have to go back to the time.
Thank you very much.
I last year at TED 10 10 to introduce the HC.
And it turns out to go back to the paper on how it works.
So I think it is. And for the ones that the other time you don't have to be the most experiment -- 27 kilometers -- 27 kilometers of circcle.
His to rear is to rear the conditions that were less than a billion billion pounds of the universe -- until 600 million times a second from the beginning of the universe to 600 million times a second at 600 million times a second from the beginning of the universe --
All of it is just the environment.
This is the machine ine Gevevation.
We do these minds of these minminds in the river.
This is what I work. It's called AS TLAS -- is 44 meters -- is 44 feet and has a 22 feet.
This is a picture of ATLATLAS in construction so you can see the proportions.
The 10 sect of the last year, we have acceso the machine for the first time.
And this pictures was taken from ATLAS.
It was because of immended in the healthy of control.
It's a image of the first fashion that LHC, in the HC, in collision, deliberately, with a part of the HC, and spread particularly particularly particularly particular.
In other words, when we see that image the 10 sector, we understand that the machine that the machine is a great living.
I don't know if it was this to do us more opposite to Google and I saw that the page.
What it means we had a cultural impact on the scientific impact on what scientific is the scientific impact on the scientific impact of the scientific impact on the scientific impact on the scientific impact on the scientific impact on the scientific impact of what we had a scientific impact on the scientific impact of the scientific impact
About a week later, it was a problem with the machine, I had to these movies here -- these movies are here -- these movies are there.
These movies are 13,000 feet when the car works at the massive pot.
Now, the technical technical and they will be not be true. I'm not true. I'm a movie. I'm not true. I'm a little too under."
And instead they can do it because when they're very fresh cosident filters.
So, at least 271 degrees to a temperature in the room between the starts to the room between the starts can bring that hair.
In one of the way we have the nest magnetic LHC, there was a dift of fabrication.
So the movies will be surgeery and 13,000 feet and 13,000 feet a resistance of electrical electrical electrical resistance to be a electrical resistance to be a electrical resistance to be a resistance to be a resistance to be a electrical resistance and the 13,000 feet of the electrical hons.
This was the result.
Now, this is still more impresside, if you think these magnetic fishing more than 20 tons in the hand, and that are fairly about 30 centimeters.
They are damed about 50 magnets.
We had to give them them to the hood.
We have repristined and beards and beyond and been.
Now they're reaching all of their places.
I actually end the end of the LHC is will be new inte.
And the accend, and we expect to get the right or to the right or him, and continue so we get to find what the morning, and we get the universe.
Now, of course, in a way, these other huses reaccendate the debate of science and engineering the science and engineering. It's easy to confut. It's easy to confut.
I think the fact that the fact that it's so difficult, the fact that it's the values of things like LHC.
I want to end with the words of a scientist Ingland, Humphrey Davy, the quale, image, I think, in the defended with the experiments of his pull, his pull, his pull, and he was Michael Farady, and he said, "No is that the remarkable to the ideas of human ideas that are not not not not not not the same thing that there are the same thing that are the conditions, and we have to have no new to be new conconversation to be a conconfifififive-consummptioneful than the confififififififififified to be be be new new new new new new new new new ideas that are of human human human human human human human human human human human human human ideas of our our our our our our our our our
Thank you.
I want to start asking to go to the way to go to the kids, you play the morning.
You get to understand how to reach them and make them and make them and they can make them and make them to think and solve problems and solve problems and to think and solve problems and so we can be able to think and make a relationship.
The space is to be foundly connected to the world the world around us.
So, from inforce inforce of our interaction with our interaction with the physical objects with my consult and my collaborator Jevan Kalanithi, I started asking and I started asking her, we have a computermic computer, instead of having the cursouse of the mouse of the deep as a re-hold hold hand that we could do a little bit of information with the information with a little bit of the huse.
and we do our force to our foreign
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer, building Siftable.
And in fact, a Siftable computation is a computer interactive computer.
And in fact, a Siftable computation is a computer interactive computer.
You can move with the hand you can see the hand they can see the hand they feel the movement and they have a radio wireless and a radio wireless and a radio wireless.
But most of course, they're the physics, as the morning, you can move to just just just just just to be just just just to be just just just to be able to be just just just to be able to be just just just to be able to be just just just just to be able to be able to be able to be just just just just to be able to be able to be able to be able to move to the morning,
Siftable is the example of a new ecost system for a new ecost of the digital education.
And as they become more physics, they know about the movement, and they are more physics, and they become more physics, and they become more physics, and they are more physically consciousness to explore, and we can explore, and new and different different different stiles.
He started with some simple example.
This Siftable is configured to show the video. If you can do the video. If you can be something, if you can be something, if you can go back from the other side side side the other hair.
These reportran interactive interactive of others.
If you do them -- you know, you are interested in the intort.
If they go to the circumstes, they can get a little bit of it.
If they go to the circumstes, they can get a little bit of it.
They also have their movement and including and including in the link and including them.
And we realized that one of the interesting interaction was the interaction of the interaction of the data, to look at the data, as if it was a color as if it was a flux.
In this case, we have three Siftable confifigured as a wind and I can use them to the surface of the color in the middle of the milk and they missing them to the surface.
and I can use them to the color in the central color in the central and they would be missed.
If we are we going to be a little bit of a place.
I'm also beautiful, and the possibility of taking the mathematics and games where people can try and try and sea things that quickly quickly quickly and see the results of the results of the results.
Now I'm --
This is a Fibonacy of Fibonacy program.
Here we have a park of the words of the Scarabeo and Boggle.
And of course, in every turning, in the case on the Siftable, Pratically, in every turning of the receives on any turning, and as you try to be a little bit about a training of a dictionary.
And then about 30 seconds of remissed, and you have a new set of beyond and new possibility to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try and new possibility to try to try and new possibility to try to try to try to try and new possibility to try to try and new possibility to try to try to try and new possibility to try to try
Thank you.
So this is what they came to the Middle in Lab, I did it in the Middle and I took a video of it.
They are pleasure a lot of it.
And one of the things of this gene is that you don't have to give people many education of the people to do many education.
You just have to say, "Compons of the parole," and they know exactly what to do.
That's how to other people who try it.
This is our head-head-head-head-old deeth.
It was just going to be a cut.
They just were going to be morning, for him.
Now, this is an apply apply of a carton the activity of a cart-interactivity.
We wanted to build a tool, for the ling's reaching the ling's Felix.
It can be to desert new characters in the scale of the Siftable to be in the Siftable to be new characters.
It can be to desert new characters in the scale of the Siftable to be in the Siftable to be new characters.
So that's what it comes out the sold.
Vide: The sole is surprised.
David Merrill: Now it took a treat the scale.
Vide: The treatment treatment of it.
Bel work!
So schooling the Siftable and put the closer can be interact the characters --
Vide: Bau!
I invent the story.
Vide: I mean, I know.
DM: It's a story with the open open and it can decide him as you can decide that you can do it.
DM: It's a story with the open open and it can decide him as you can decide that you can do it.
Volol: Volue,
DM: The last example I have time to show you is a tool, to show you is a tool, to be a little music.
It's a tool, I realized of recently, to campionary and exeguing and exeguing music.
Siftable here are act from the sound as a based and bacteria as a lower and bacteria
Every one of these has four different different variations, and you can chook that we use it.
You can insert these sounds in a sequence from your own own as a compounds.
And the just just doing a sound sounds a sounds and a "Red."
These are actually you can control from the live, as the reveral and the movie.
The attacks to a very sound and then you can get it.
And then there are the general effects like time and fly and flighting the whole sequence.
We look at how it works.
Vide: So we will start put a basic in two Siftable in two Siftable "Red" system, we put in a series, the summer of the extend to the other based on the bottom.
Now I put a bunch of the blow.
Vide: I added by add percent using the --
Vide: So I'm going to put the bacteria, so I can control the effect from the live.
Video: I can speak the whole whole thing to sequence the whole time from the other.
Vide: So I go to add the bottom of the bottom,
Vide: I can recombined the sequence "Look at the volo."
So I don't have to planne, but I can be suddenly forward the longer or more corn.
And now, I end up the whole sequence of the intersequence of the left Siftable to the Sift."
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is to build new interfaces -- it always works as a way of how they work our brain.
And today, I had time to show you one of the result of this loper, and also some chance that we try to bring out from the lab of the lab of the lab of the lab of this lost remarkable to be out of the result of this lost of the performance of this lost and I think we can take out from the lab to bring out out of the lab to bring out of the lab of the per,
The concept I want to transmit is that it's going to go this new generation of the design of the design of the design in our world in our world in our world in the way we want to do it.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the now of talking about all of you.
I am a write writer.
I want to be books is my professional exsion but it's more than that, of course,
It's also the love and the friends of my life.
And I don't expect that it can change.
But I said that, something about this is a very successful in my life and I was in my career and I had to realibrate the whole relationship with this work.
The particular thing is that I recently recently written this book, this biography called Mangia, Prega, and so I was a qual, and I was a lot of the world and become a lot of reason and become a big world and become a big exist, and it became a big exist, and it became a big exist, and it became a big exist, and it became a big exist,
And the result is that everybody's people who had to be as if you were condanned.
I mean, it was -- condanning --
They are all worried and I think I don't have any longer to do not paper, you can't do anymore.
You don't have a paper to keep writing for all of life without able to create a book that can be important to do any?"
that can important anyone on?"
It's rassically, you know it.
But it could go worst the worst of the 20 years ago, when I started to say to people -- I was a writing people -- I wanted to be a written to be a written written a tricky written a tricky writer.
I went to the same reaction from the land.
And people say, "You don't have to have to have to have succeed?
You don't have a paper, which the refairly kill?
You don't have to do this mestiate for all of life without any life without any of the sleeping and die on a heart of every infrance with the hand band sweat to love with failing the band s?"
You know, you know it.
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is "i."
I have to get all of those things.
I always had a land.
And I also have a lot of other things that people don't have to be unlike.
As the algae and other things that you have.
But the way about how I was writing what I thought I was and I asked me to ask me, is why?
It's ration?
It's logical that anyone who should be spent to be spectivated by a work that you know, I feel about it.
But what is that there is so particularly in the impreseats to make us about the healthy of the minute to be not phane?
As my father for example, he was a chimical engineer and not remember a time in the activity where it was asked if it was asked if it was asked if it was asked if it was asked if it was asked to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be to be to be to be engineer and I don't remember what if it was was asked if it was asked if it was asked if it was asked if it was a chance to be
I never -- that block of engineer engineer to John, how do you go out of it?
It didn't work.
Of course, the engineers like a group of chemical engineers don't have certain tremendous reputation of being alcouraged the reputation of being alcouraged to be alcouraged to be alcouraged with depressisive.
We write it enough to this reputation and not only writers but creatives but creatives of every genere, we have this reputting reputting them to be huge instable,
And it's not really, to look at the death of the magnifies of the magnifies that creative is only in the 20th century, just in the 20th century, and often to each other.
And the ones that are not suicide seem to be really, they really have been made by their women.
Norman Mailer, before I was a little bit of the last interview of it, he said, "I had a little bit more than a little bit more about the work of life.
But we don't get to go to hear because we have these things like to say because we heard these things so we have all interiorate and accepted the notion that creativity is a way and the art, and it will be in a way and it will be going to go to the hang and it will be going to go to the hang and the hand, and the hand that the art, and it will be able to the hood.
And the question I want to bring to all all of the right today is you know, you know, with this ide?
You know, it's good to this -- because you look at a centimeter than a centimeter for nothing to this suppose for nothing to this suppopoor not good for this suppopod.
I think it's odiose.
And I think it's also dangerous and I don't want to see the perpetuate in the next century.
I think it's better to encourage our great creative minds in the lives.
And I know that I was that in my case -- in my case -- it would be very dangerous to be becoming out to the constict of the constict the circumstances and where I am in my career.
It's really -- unlike you look at the time, I have about 40 years.
I still have about four decades of work in me.
And it's very likely to be going to write that everything is going to be right from the world as the work that they used to get it after the last book.
He slavery, because we are all more or less friends here -- it's likely to my greatest success is to my own smoke.
Oh, Ges: You think of that!
You know this is the gene of thinking that leads a person to start to go to the game in the morning, and I don't want to do it.
I would continue to go to do this work we do.
So, the question is the question I think about that?
And so I was a lot of reflecting me to work to keep write is to write to write a psychological costructure, right?
I had somehow to find a distance of physics that I'm writing with me, which I'm writing the natural thing to be on which reaction to get all of the last year, and I was trying to look at the time, to look at the time, trying to look through the time, to look at other society to see the time if they could have the best ideas and the best ideas and the best ideas and more healthy and the best ideas and more and the ideas that I was going to see if they could be able to see the other than the world
to help people create the people create the risks of the inerent risks of creative creative creativity.
And that research has been to the Greek and antics and antics of the antics and antics of the antics and antics and antic.
Seguitemes because the giving and then back back to the back.
Nellechics and antics and antics of the people didn't seem to believe that the creativity came to humans came to the human beings, OK?
It was thought that creativity was this spirit and they come to the human and who came to the men from a few people distant and unknown as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as they were known to the human and unknown as we were known to the human human beings and unknown as if you were in the human beings and unknown as they were known as they come to the knowledge and know
The green green was these demonizes of creativity of creativity of creativity
Socrate, wonderful that I had a demone that elelargives from the saging from the smoke.
Romans were the same idea, but they call that the spirit of spirit without a genie.
The big thing is great, because the Romans didn't think that a genius was a kind of intelligence of a particular intelligence of it.
They create a genious gene that was this kind of entity that I was literally in the last last months of a study of a little bit like the Army, and who came out of the work of the artist of the work of the artist and the work of the artist and the work of that work.
Each -- -- -- -- -- -- -- that's the distance of the part, which is the part, that cool is the result of your work.
And all they knew that it was so that it was so that it work?
So the artists were prouding by certain things, like to the thing, as for the example of the southern arcis; right?
If your work was exceptional job, you could not take to keep all the deeeper and all of the same time I was helped from this genie.
If your work fail, it was not all of the whole ture, right?
Everybody knew that it was your genium to be a unable inable to be a unable inable to be a unable inable to be a unable inable to be a unable inable to be a inable inable to be a inable inable to be a inable inable to be a inable inable inable.
And so people han concept the creative creativity in Occident for a long time.
And then the Rindication came and all of the way and it is going to put the human beings to be ump the center of the universe and the mysters that write and no more to leave the detail of detail.
This was the most of the human rational and people started thinking that creativity and people started thinking that creativity was completely from the idivided to be in the idivided of the human being.
And for the first time in history, you know, I was to reference this argue like a gene of a kind of a genie.
And I have to tell you, I think it was a big mistake.
I think I can afford anything, a simple person to believe that being a recipe of creative and the essence and the essence and the same things that are not not going to be a responsibility to be a responsibility to the fragile to the fragile to the fragile to the fragile of human fragile and the same mysters that
It's like to ask someone to to English the sold.
I started and creates the arrate and creates all these ingestiable to be on the performance.
And I think it was this pression to have been this pression of the 19-year-old artists in the past.
And if this is true, and I think it is the question and hold it -- and I think it is.
Can we do it different?
And I go back to a more profound understanding of the relationship of human relationship and creative relationship.
Or maybe not.
We can not be a chanannels in a talk about a 18 minutes.
And there are probably people in the public that soll, it would be legittied by the notion of the nation of the nice that they follow people are going to be the next to their projects.
You probably won't tell you all about this thing.
But the question I want to bring is -- because I would you have to do it is -- because I would do that?
Why don't you think about this way?
because it has more sense of every other thing that has ever heard to explaining the extreme of the creative process of creative process of creative process of creative process of creative creative process of creative process of creative process of creative process of creative creative and creative to explaining the explain the creativity of every other thing that you ever heard of the process of creative process of creativity.
One process that you ever have to do something -- so fundamentally, all of this -- so everyone is not to be in the rational process of report.
And in fact, you know, sometimes it looks completely paranormal paranormal --
I did this insurely with the Ruth Stone, which has now 90 years, but it was a little bit of a poeter for all of life and I said that when he was a little bit of the Virginia, and I felt in the Cural cam, and I felt in the field, and I feel that it was from the land.
I said that it was like a fragorous fragorous phragorous fragorous fragorous phragorous fragorous phragorous phragorous fragorous fragorous fragorous fragorous fragorous fragorous fragorous fragorous fragorous fragorous fragorous fragorous phragorous phragorous fragory.
And that it was rounding to her from the land.
And it comes to the way to do it to be getting the earth under its feet.
You have one one thing to do to do that point and it was words like a morn."
And so it goes back to the home and it would be initiated by this poesia, and it would not have to do a piece of card and a long long enough to be a little bit of a carry and the translate and the page of the page.
And sometimes it couldn't be very quickly as it is and correcent and correcent and correcent and the hold and the rountoled and she was going to stay through and she was going to stay through the landscape, as if you go to the landscape, as if you say, "another poet."
And then there were the time -- this piece of not forgotten -- there were no time -- there were almost loper,
So, it was going to go home and he was trying to card and the past, and he was going to go through a long time and then he was going to go and then he was as if you go to the other hand the other hand the argue and the around.
And it was the couuupon and the release in his body and transcle and transcle on the page.
And in these hand the poesia would be presented on the perfect and I mean to the last word at the last word at the last word at the last word at the last word at the last word at the last word at the last word at the last word at the last word at the last word at the last word of the last word at the last word of the time.
So when you hear it -- is the landscape, is exactly the south, it's exactly the creative process to my creative process of creative process --
I don't all my creative process -- they're not a conduction of it.
I'm a mult, and my way to work is -- I sweet me at the same orary every day and go to the same time.
But even I was in my head, I was going to be in my head, I was going to be there.
And I imagine that I also many of you have a han done.
You know, even though the work and the ideas came to be drageous and the ideas would not be able to be able to be lost in it.
And what is this thing?
And how can we relate to the head, we don't even even even give us the head, and it is to be sleeping it?
I think I was a better example of the contemporary example that I have is the musician in Tom Waits, which I interviewed a journey for a journal years ago for a journal years ago for a journey.
We were talking about this, and you know, Tom, for the most life of the artist of the artist of the artist of the artist of the artist of control, to control these species of impull implate these species of impull implated.
But then you go to the walk and a day when it was driving on the way to the Los Angeles, it changed all for him.
It was going to go fast, and all of a sent that little framework of a half a lodia, which comes in his head, and it is the inspiration, and the want, and the want, and the want, and the desire, but it doesn't know how to take it is.
It doesn't have a piece of car, it doesn't have a matters of a car,
So I start to hear this sort of old old antum to be growing in him in a little bit of performan, and he was sessioned by this song of permission of the permission of it.
I didn't have enough and I can't do it and I can't do that."
And instead of going to go to the panic of it.
It was a whole process of minal process and he did something completely new thing.
I just look at the sky and he said, "You know, I don't see what I'm driving that?"
"Do you feel a song that can write a song or door or now?
If you really want to exist, you go to a more opposite when I can take care of you.
And I trilled to the other today's going to do anyone today.
I wanted to disturbing Leonard Cohen."
And his process working working on the process of changed this.
I don't work in the work, the work was still happy as you know,
But the process, and the fishing of the heavy that was releaved when I pret the genie, the geniest that it was going to be a little bit of the problems and free it was going to be a whole thing.
but it was a lot of this peculish, and the extra collaboration of the Tom and this strange and this strange is not Tom.
So how the story that I feel that story to change a little bit of the way I was working and I was already save a time.
This idea, I was writing when I was writing Mangia, Prega, and Ama," and the cadition of the disperation where we all all when we go to work on something and we can not be thinking that will be going to think that it's going to think that will be the worth -- that it will be the worth.
Not only good at the worst book written writing.
And I started to think of the project.
But then I remember Tom I talk about Tom I talk about it.
So I alzen my face on the hands from the hands and I would say, I feel like my comments to a corner of the room.
And I said to you know, "You know, you know, if you know that if this book is not going to be brilliant not going to be brilliant to measure, right?
because I see what I am I going to put all the hand, I don't have more than that.
So if you want to be better -- you have to give you your parts.
Okay. But if you don't know the things -- I don't know what it is not free.
I'm going to write my work because it's my work.
And I want to favor that I was recorded to do my part I was a talk about the end of the North -- sitting is that in the North Africa in the North th of the North Africa was a long for the dance, and clear, and the clear, and music and the music and the music and the sacra and until the tree.
And they were always magnified, because the ballers were fantastic professional and were fantastic professional and were fantastic.
But every one of the gently, something happens, and one of these artists became actually transactive reality.
And I know what you know about what I know is that you have the view of all of the view, a little bit of it.
It was like the time you stop the time and the baller's walk through a kind of portal portraising and it was not a different way from the sun, but it is all the time.
And the suddenly not just like a human being.
But you have acceptions from the devices in the device.
And when this next to the time -- you know, people knew what it was -- they called the not.
They had the hands and they start to cant, "Allah, Allah, God od od God, God God, God."
That's God, you know it.
And he was a great story -- when the Morderer Morderer of the Spay, they were this abitude with their own own and the leaves of the Spage in the sees of the Spage in the sous, and he said, "Look, you can hear in the corries or in the reflam.
In Spay when a paper is done something impossible and magic and magic -- and you know, and it -- -- a very good -- a last last of God.
And it's great. because we have to have no need to be done.
But the problem comes the next day after the dam, for the haller's -- when you see it is the 11 of the last last last last last last of the last last last of the Dod is not more.
It's just a dead death, and maybe it will never be able to do that ale’s more to make that treat that aleze.
And maybe nobody will be the name of God still as it is going to do with the rest of his lives?
It's hard to be difficult.
This is one of the most paper in a creative life.
But maybe it has no need to be so angotitious if you could not believe that it is more extraordinary of your being being from you to be so much more of your being being from you to be so much more of your own own own it.
But I believe that I'm going to be data in prester from a image of this team of this team of the life that you have to go to somewhere you have to go to somewhere you have to go to somewhere I have.
And you know, if we think in this way to change it.
And so I started thinking about it, and it is sure as I thought I thought for different months during the work that I was a lot of the book that audience, the dangerous -- I was very success.
And what I have to keep to tell when I feel I feel that I feel about the sought to this is, not for the land.
I don't have to just your work.
It was going to presents for your parts, any can be about?
If your work is balling work is ball.
If the debest, I would be assigned to leave the decide of leaving some kind of wonderful to the scale of your own own your sants and then "O!"
And I trilled the same your dance.
And "O!" I mean, you know, the itself.
I think I think I don't think I should teach it.
"O!" I mean, it is not only for the human and the head, and the heads of the talks to do it continue.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
As you know I had talked about a few of these projects on the genome of human projects on the genes.
We're now beginning to a new perspective and we started digitalize the biology and now to start to go to a new fasking and we're going to go into a new fasking life.
We always tried to do the big questions.
So what is the liv?" is something that many biological I think we have to try to understand the lives.
We tried different approach, reducing a minimate for the minimum in the minimum of the minimmers.
We're digitalize from almost 20 years ormas.
When we sequence the genome of the world was going to go from the world from the analyc world of the digital world of the computer.
Now we asked us to do the life -- we can regenerate the new life from this universe from this digital univer?
This is the map of a little organism; the Mycoplasma genitalium, which is the kind of the genome of the genome of those that can authorate in the lab in the lab of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little organisms.
And we tried to reduce the genome of creating a more smaller than a little bit more smaller than that.
We are able to eliminate a centinaid of the genes of about 500 that are here.
But when we have a check at his map methabolic make, is relatively simple to the nostrength.
I think it's simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate a time, is very likely to bring a cell that this can bring a celluum.
So we decided that the only only only to progreenable to progression to progression to the mountain a way to bring some of these questions to bring some of these questions to do some fundamental questions
And so we started the wind of the "Can we can synthesize a tail?"
Can you feel about making these great molecule that we never have to make these great moleces to create before I haven't been going to create before the earth?
And in case of the way, we can do a tail?
A mosomsometimes is just a piece of chemical material in the chemistry of the inert.
The speed we are able to digitalize life is growing the exponential exponential exponential exponential exponential exponential exponential of the speeds.
Our ability to write the genetic code code and flows rather than it is better than it is improgree.
And our most recently recently the result of a exponential curve exponential curve to a curve current curves.
We have been more than 15 years ago.
The process has asked a lot of past and started with a bioetic reviewing the first experiments.
But we found that synthesizing DNA is very difficult.
There are decades of thousands of machines in the world that product little century of DNA, of the long 3-le-le-le-le-le-le-le-to-to-handed is a long remarkable to be a degeneral is a long channel.
So we had to develop a new metodo to assemble these frames and correcent to the mistakes.
And this was our first attempt to start information from the digital of the Phi 20174.
It's a little virus who kills kills bacteria
We designed the framments, effectively the reportation of the mistakers and get a molecule of about 5,000 literally.
The interesting part of the interesting is when we took this piece of chemical material and we put it in the bacteria and we put it in the bacteria and promimit and promimimit particles and promimit particles and providing particles particles in the bacteria and we put this in the bacteria particles in the bacteria and
The particles are then released by phones, are back from the phone, and they have been gone.
I talked about recent with member of the industrial industry was saying that they have certain of them that they have certain activity.
They have reach more than you.
We believe that this is a situation where software actually building its same hardware really built his same hardwing in a biological system.
But we wanted to do the biggest things in the greatest
We wanted to build the whole skin the bacteria of bacteria
I'm more than 580 miles the bedond code code of genetic code code code code genetic code.
So we thought we did it in the cassessor of virus, so we can change the casses, so we can change the cell of a cell.
The projection is crucial project, and if we start with digital information in a computer, these have to be very accurate to be very accurate to be very accurate with the project.
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 the accurateless of a 10 miles for every 10 miles.
We have discovered, 30 mistake -- when we used to use that the original sequence of the original consequence will be able to do it work.
A part of the process is designing long as we swing the 50 beyond with all the other segent to 50 beyond for 50 beyond to build under-like jobs.
We try to be a lot of the only here.
You probably have a baby that we put the flight.
Think of this -- we have a code code on four literally lens and T.
Three of those reads are going to do about 20 friends about 20 friends, and there's a specific order to be a specific order to be a specifical ors.
So we can use the genetic to write words, and do it as well.
What we did we do to be authography.
Some were deluses from the fact that it was not a poet.
We designed these segments for a few minutes just just to be able to be able to be a measure.
There are the entertail and put them and put them away.
And we started to get to the parts, starting with seven to seven miles, by five to seven miles, the unends of 24 miles, the labs of 24 miles.
And every past we have these segments in the abundance so that we're trying to make a very concerned that we're trying to create a very roble-hanang -- as you can see in a minute.
We're trying to automatiatizy the process.
So this looks like the tabellow a player of a lower of the bottom.
When we go to these segments in these segments are not going to be more directly in E.
It comes to the limits of modern biology of the biology molecular biology of the biology molecule.
So we have to be other mechanismi.
We know about another months called recombination recombination called recombination recombination for recombining the DNA to reparate the DNA to reparate the DNA in the segments.
Here's an example.
This organism; it called Deinococcus radians, can make three million rad of radiation.
You can see in the reaching of the southern revenue as the sous.
In 12 -- 24 hours is resembled exactly how it was the prize.
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do it.
These organisms can be able to be complete complete complete complete beard.
I can live under the act.
I'm absolutely sure that life existing in space, and you can find new environments of water.
I mean, the NASA has showed that this avenes.
This is a picture of the molecule that we have built these procession to use these proces; just using the design appropriate of the segments from inserious inseries.
The skin the automatically.
This is not been taken with a microscope with a microscope with a microscope rule.
It's a molecule so much that we can see the with a microscope with a microscope law.
These are pictures that they cover a long time of six seconds.
This is the publisher that we did a little time ago.
I'm more than 580,000 letters of code code code of genetic code --
It's the molecule the greatest of a definitely construction of the human construction of the human finger.
It's a lot of fish, a lot of 300 million ones.
If we were going to be a 10 without a 10 without spaces, it would like 142 pages just to transclet this code of genetic just to transclaim.
Now, how do we work? How do we activity it?
Of course, you know, a virus is a game from a little bit of a kids.
It's a little more complicated when they use bacteria on the bacteria
It's simpler when it is the celleucariote as our not, you can just extinct the nucleum and inserirs a higher and inserserty and resert the process of clone.
In the bacteria the skin is a mounted inside the phone, but we have recently demonstrate that we're able to do a trailing trapic of a tail, and the activity of activity and activity to the activity and activity to the activity is to the activity of activity and activity is a lot of activity is to do a train a mosome.
We have a micro-scale a mounting a microbial species of a microbial different species of the microbial mountain a microbial mountailing a microbial mountain a microbial mosome.
The two are different as the tolds from topi.
We have added some gene of the more in the way to decide what to choose to this sky.
And then it has then to be a way to kill all the protect of the protect of the protect protects of the protect of the protect with the protect of the protect with the protect of the proteins.
And when we put in the cellula is been studied to -- and we appreciate our graphic graphic defflies -- the new mountain the phone.
And we really thought we couldn't go to the text and we try to be a lot of a lot of the most in the last.
This is one of the greatest munding.
We found that very much species have added a second or a third third a third of a third of a few parts, I added a few of new tracks to the species.
So those who think about evolution as a gene of the time that you get a gene of the biologists of the biology.
They are the entertaines called "re-constictional restription of the DNA.
The mosomsometimes it was in the cellula doesn't have a lot of it.
The pha-tail tails we have inserito--tail ha.
And it is expressesed, and it has the other hand the other hand we are existed with the hell and we are return with only cell with the whole new and the new moun.
It became the blue because of the genes we have insert.
And in a short lash of time, all the characteristics of a kind of a kind of a new software are going to be in a new software that we put in the new software we insert in the phone in the phone of the phone in the phone.
All the protect is changed, the member are changed, and when we read the genetic cost of the equivalent to what we have transformed.
Now, this might look at genetic alchemical alchemical software we can change things in a lot of replace.
Now, I already explained that that you don't talk about genes: but of progress -- but of the three million evolutionary of evolutionary explosion of Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosion of the design design of new species of the design design design design design of the Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explan.
because it is doing that?
I think it's obvious when we think about our necessarily necessary.
We're going to go from six billion people to the next to the next 40 years.
Just to give you a example: I was born in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for each one exist, in 1946; it will be over the time.
We're now now now to find the problems now to find the water and a lot of water and a half billion people.
It's going to be more difficult to do it for a billion
We use more than five billion carbon of carbon of the olisons of the olid.
That means a million bark of the day.
When I try to find biological approach, you know, any kind of process to repiece, it will be a challenge of a challenge of the process of a huge challenge of the process of repieces to repiece.
We need to keep all the whole of the CO2 from these materials that end up in the atmosphere.
At the day of today, thank you to the scientific discoveries in the world we have a 20 million genes, and I love thinking that are components for the future.
The electronic industry is just a dozen about components, and you think about how many things are come to be come.
Our limits here are the biological data from the biological reality and our imagination.
Now we have the techniques of the rapidly of the sintetization, in the generation of creating what we call a genomic genomics of combined.
We are able to build a big robot that can produce a million skeletal tail.
Think of this process, these 20 million genes or different different or to try to try and make a drugs, new vaccines, new extra drugs, we can change a little bit of biology and create a little bit of biology that in the last 20 years of science.
And it's just a sleping sea standard.
We can take a chance to survive to survive and a carbon and production of vaccines or carbon vaccines of the vaccines or a lot of carbon and a lot of carbon and a lot of carbon and a lot of carbon and a lot of carbon and a lot of carbon and calculation, production of the cost of the checket
This is a few software of a few software are working on which we're working for being able to be able to sell and design species to be able to be able to sell and design.
Well, we don't know it as it will be year.
We know exactly what their genetic code code --
We're now going to be about the carbon of the fourth generation.
You also have seen that you go to the hetanol was a experiment was a experiment experiment in the audience.
We have carbon on the second generation that will use enough to be a lot of carbon and the highest of the highest values like the either of the highest amount of fanol.
But the only way the biology can have a great impact of the food that we are working on the food and limited the cost of food and limited the cost CO2 in material that we are working for designing the CO2 in material that we are working to design that they can be able to design this purpopose in the first of the exist.
The sunlight light with the CO2 is a metodo-- but in our discoveries in our discoveries in our world we found different metoes.
This is a organism that we have to written in 1996.
They live in the ocean of the deep ocean to the temperature of the water.
They create metry from CO2 using hydrogeno molecular hydrogene as a source of energy.
We're trying to understand if we can inchanaling CO2, which can easily transportated that CO2 in carbon and driving this process of CO2 in the carbon and driving this process.
So we think we could be able to increase what the question of increase what the question of the basic question that the lives is Not -- we have the victims of remale to remit the whole industry --
You can do it not do it from TED, where you can do it from TED, where you can do it?
It would be a main the main the funny of energy.
And we're working for the same way to use the same metoes to create vaccines to create vaccines of aneths.
You saw this year with the influence, we're always going to get a year and a dollar at least when it is to find the right right now.
I think what you can change in the antician anticide in anticians.
So this is how the future could start changing now, the tree of evolutionary evolutionary evolutionary evolutionary evolutionary and initive cells.
We are so much as we have to make people.
Our purpopose is to do enough to try to try to try to try to try to do it for a much.
I think of all you will be the fastest as much as we can be a fundamental Microsoft in the Microsoft in a following water. This is a year -- this is Seadragon.
It's a environmental environment, where you can interact is to the local level that remote with a huge amount of data to visual date.
We're seeing a lot of a lot of a digital photos of digital photos with a zoom and continue, for a long long long long and for a speaker and they are all the images like we want to do.
And it doesn't matter how much the amount of information that we see it is the amount of information or the things or the images.
Most of the photographs are a digital photograph, but this is a scanded by the Bible of Congress, and reenter in the Congress, and reenter in 300 miles of the Congress,
It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that the prestations of a system like this is the number of pixels in your screen in any moment. It's also a very flexel of architecture
This is a book book of data not imagines.
This is Casa Casa Sun-Sun-soldied represents a capitule.
To show you that it's just about your head, and we can't do something like to do something like this, to do something that it's a representation of a representation of the head, not a fairly representation of the head,
It could be a way a little artificial book:
You don't have the add it.
This is a more realistic example of the Guardian.
Every very image is the beginning of a see.
And it really will be the pleaseasure and the beauty experience of reading the version of a review of a review of a review of a respect of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a remarkable version and the kind of a respect of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of reality and
We also did something with the corner of this number of this particular Guardian.
We have a published advertit to the higher -- much more than you use in a normal -- and we put you in a normal -- and we put it in a normal content -- and we put it in the content of the content -- and we put it in a normal ex.
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile, you can see here.
Or other models, or even the specific specific detect the specific phones.
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space.
We hope that this gentlemifies to the pop-hour and a million to be necessarily replace to be necessarily need to be necessary.
Of course, the map is one of the most of the most obvious aps.
And on this not I want to lose time, if we don't want to say that we have contributed to give it in this field.
These are all the streets in the U.S. SSA.
So now we're going to go to something.
This is now actually from the webs; you can go to see it.
It's a project called Photosynth, which fight two different technologies.
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual research at the computer computer product from Noah Snave, a student, with the University of Washington, with Steve Seitz of the Resear's and Resear's Microsoft of Microsoft Resear.
And it's from the journey of the web, I was from Seadragon.
You can see when we do this kind of pattern and you can go from a image to the other and have this kind of experience this kind of experience to solve solution in the last plan to solve solution in the time.
But the collection of space, the collective images here has actually a meaning.
The tregorial algoriththm of computers have recorded these images together, so that the corresponds to the places where the reals are reacting -- all of the laghi Grases Roccurrently Roctic Roccious Grases -- they have been a slide-hemember of a slide-of hairly hember of the things are all all of space.
I don't know if I don't know if I have to show you some other environment.
There are a lot more space.
I want to go to a directly to a provide of Noah-- and this is from a precedent prototypes that we did work for the first time -- we did it works.
We had to worry about what I would like to be hood.
This is a reconstruction of the cattedral of Notary Dame images from Flicker Basta Please Noting Notary Dame and get images of the cameras a pus and go and you can get a picture of these things that is discovered. Every very image. Every very image.
So I'm all the images from Flickr and have all connected to the space in this way.
And it is possible to navigate in this simple way.
You know, I never thought I would never think about the Microsoft.
It's very fresh fresh to get this kind of account here.
I think you can see that it's a lot of different different types of fairly different fell phones to those professional professional of the SLR, a number of meaning in this environment.
And if I can try and try to try and find those more strange.
Many block are block to the hood.
And then then you have a series of photographs -- there are a series of photographs.
This is a poster of Notber Dame record.
We can go from the poster to the view of this environment.
The essential point is that we can do the social environmental things with the social environment. This is now from everybody's interpre-collecting data from the view of how to the extract on the visual objects -- and connecting all those data together.
All those pictures become connected together, greater than the parts.
You have a model of the interaction that emerge.
You think about this as a mountain Stephen Lawler Lawler on Earth virtual virtual
It's something that growing and complexity as the people who use it and the people who use it to be increasing with useful use.
Their pictures are marked by other people.
If you get the idea of conversation is to construct all of these sants say the French of Notary Dame Dame Dame Dame Dame of all those dates, and I can use how to do I can use how to do it as a ressweet for immermers to get a social social experience.
And of course, a consequence of all of the most of all of the extreme of every interesting part of the term, and the remarkable of the term, and the satellitary and sex, but by the memory of the collective.
Mille thank you.
Chris Anderson: I realized that what your software you going to do is that you can do is that a certain point, in the next years, all of the pictures of everybody's interest in the world or will be connecting together?
BA: Yeah. What is doing is actually actually actually discover it.
It's creating the hyperlink, if you want to do it, you can image.
And it's doing it is doing it in the content of the images.
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the respect of the information of the things that many of these images of these images of these images of these images of these images of the respect of the respect of the respect of the respect of the respect of the respecting.
As you do a research of images on the web, you know, a fairly fairly on the page,
Now, what happens if that pictures you connect all of your four?
So the amount of interconnection to the amount of the resemantic and the amount of respect that is really huge classical classical effect.
CA: Blaise, it's really incredible Compliments.
BAA: I thank you very much.
One of the main the main when you travels and a delight-and research is the way to live between who has no minute between who has no minute the past, in the past, the past, in the wind in the wind of the past, and the sleep, the sought in the past, and we can get a love-hhold hold hands from the sleep,
Bastes think the monkeys Jaguar traveling the Vy Lattea, or that the mites are still colate in the Inum of the Inum -- which in Himalaya, the budge of the Dharan in Himalaya, and the idea that we live in the important world that we live in Himalaya, but it's not a sense of the world that we live not exist, but it's just a model of reality, but it's not just a model of the world
the consequence of a particular consequence of the adapted choices that our stirts is a lot of generations ago.
And of course, we all share we all share the essential track.
All we all all forward we do.
We are subject to the beginning.
We have to deal with the dead of death -- so we don't take it and whales --
We all have a art.
What it is the very very very particular of the dog of the dance of every culture.
Not important that are Penan inforests of the Borneo, or the Voodoor of Haiti, or Haiti, or the Haite's desert in Kenya secentrional camera, or a cammellize in the heart Curander's hearting.
He was my journey of my journey in the desert a month ago, or a dough of the yargue in the world on the world.
All of these people teachers are teaching us that there are other ways to think of other ways to think of other ways to be in the world.
And if you reflecting a time, is a concept that you can give you a hope you hope to give you a little bit of it.
Inside, the measures of cultures of cultures of the world creating a spiritual and cultural life that would be important for the planet and is important for the benefit is important as the planet as the biological biosphones as the biological biosphosphies.
And you can think about this railt-cultural railty as a etnos; it can be the etnossphery of all the concepts, and the concept, and respections, intuities, and intuitiities, and they were being from the imagination from the opposite of the consciouse.
The etnospher's greatest empathrimony.
It's the symboll of what we are and what we can be in how much much as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as a kind of what we can be in how much as much as much as much as much as a kind of inquise.
And I sure the whosphwas was been been been been been been been been been been successful and so much much more quickly.
No biology, for example, it would be that the 50percent of all the species was or the extinction of the summer -- in the existing -- in the potential in the biological of biological diversity -- and you don't have to be a little bit more optimistic -- and you don't have a little bit more more cultural -- that different cultural diversity -- that different cultural of cultural cultural --
The indicates all of the thing is, of course, the perditional language.
When you were born 6,000 lingers on this planet.
One language is not just to a vabolary or a series of rules.
One of the spirit of the spirit of human spirit of human spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spi
It's the middle of every cultures of every cultural cultural world.
Every language is a forest to the minute of the mind, a thought of the spiritual spiritual of the spiritual spiritual of the spiritual becomes to the becomes to a spiritual of the spiritual bee.

The dogal official of all the industrial society of all the dogal society but official of the dog" -- "If we want to be our city, "What is massive freedo" to do is massive freedom.
The reason I was a last, in fact, that freedom is the same one value, is unpretious value, and essential for humans.
And the other is the fact that if we are free, each of us can act for all of us to do all that mass our benefit without any decides.
The way to be freedom is a little bit of freedom.
The people are free people are free, and more free is their freedom, and more and the freedom is their benefit is their benefit is their benefit is their benefit is their freedom, and the freedom, and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and it is their freedom.
This is so deeeply so I was deeply in society that nobody would be able to put it in the two.
And it's also deeply in our lives.
I'm going to show you some examples of what the progress has reach us possible.
This is my supermarket. It's not a big big thing.
I lost a simple note about the conditions.
In my supermarket is 175 conditions, without containing the 10 variety of the extract and the 12 acets. And the 12 acets. You can buy a huge amount of constantly conconstent of constant constantly in the circumstances of your degree is to your degree.
That's the supermarket.
And then you go to the electronic sought to buy a stereas a stereas a stereas a stereas a stereas well.
And in this single narrole of electronic electronic electronic components --
We can do six million and a half million different combinations using the components that there are in a only negoti.
You have to put that there is a lot of choice.
Some cameras the world of communications.
And one time, when I was a kid, they could get all the phone of the phones that were used to be foreign from mom mom Bell.
He had the phones the phones don't buy it.
One consequence of that, in the other, it was that the telephone is not romels.
These temples are gone.
Now we have a variety of the phones of telephones of telephones --
That's the phones of the future.
My favorite is what in a half a MP3, and cut the now's not, and foreign the crym of the drum.
If you don't have seen in the sought in the house, you're going to be true.
And what happens is that the end is that people go in the southern and does this question is the answer? The answer is "No."
It's not possible to buy a phone that doesn't do too much things.
So, in other expects of life that are much more important than the water, it is the same explosion of choice.
Assistance doesn't happen in the United States that you go from the doctors and the doctors and the doctors is going to do.
I went to the doctor, and the doctor, you know, "You could do -- or B" "A has these benefits and these risk" and these risk." What do you want to do you do that?"
You know, "Dot" Dot, what should I do that?"
And the doctor, "A has these benefits and these risks, and the By has these benefits and these risk."
"What you want to do that?"
And you rebate "Dottor if she was the thing to do that?"
And the doc: "But I am not lei."
The result we call it "authonomy of malato," expression that it looks like a beautiful thing.
But it is not that one to be a smoker and the responsibility of the decisions from somebody who knows something, and it is the doctor, and so it doesn't know -- and so it is not in the conditional conditional for decisions to make decisions to make the patient.
There's a huge marketing marketing products of products of products and you know, if you think you think it doesn't have any send sense, that we can't buy them.
But if we can't buy them, because you don't buy them, because you know,
The answer is that they want to door to ask the doctor, to ask us to change the recepty.
So what we have to be the fundamental issue, is a question of choice, as you see in this journey of the way to see the children. We don't want to be force the right right now, and we have a more education to the right right now, we have to invent the remarkable to invent the invent.
And we can reinvent, so many times it hits up to the time.
The one means that every morning, you know, you want to decide that kind of person you want to do you to do that you want to do you to do that you want to do you to do you know that kind of person who are to do you know that you can do you want to do you to do you that each more.
And I think about the family and the maintain a time time the perspective of the common -- I was that there was no longer to anywhere it was going to be the most prepret as possible.
The only real choice was with you chicken anything, and even even what do you do to do.
Onne, it's really really to play it.
I mean, in a very smart students and they have 20 percent in less work than a time.
And because it is not not the brilliants.
But why are I implents, I mean, I should I tell you about that? I should I do do that? I should I do do do that?"
I should I reach me the latest I have to think before I do think before I had to think about the care?"
I'm interrogatic interrogatic --
And they try to answer these questions, even though this implement doesn't be able to be the company and not to get a good and not to get a bel of my exame.
And they have to do it. I'm going to do it.
Now, the job: we're lucky, like Carl subolineavy, because technology technology allows us to work every day, from the Hotel Randh's from Hotel Randph.
And it turns out there is a angolin, and I'm not going to tell anybody where the WiFi WiFi works.
I don't know that because I want to use it.
What does it means, this incredible freedom that we have about the job? It's that we need to work in every time. if we need to work or not.
We can go to see our kid play, with the phone to the cell phone in the hour in the other, and the night in the knel, and the night of the key to the key ey's glass.
And even if I all have to the gentertain that we see our kid to the word, we are also asking this called "I have to answer this called ""Do I have to answer this called "Do I have to answer this called "I have to answer this called the game of the worth?"
"I have to answer this to this email? I have to abbozing this liter?"
And even when the answer is "no," all this makes the parent experience of the parent of your son to be in other conditions.
So, from any part of the things and the big things and the things of the material and stils of life, life is a question of choice.
And once the world was this: Of course there were some possibility, but it was no possibility, but it was not a question of choice.
The world is a little bit like this: The dilemma is a positive thing. It's a positive thing.
The answer is the answer is --
The late are all known of the negative we all talk about the negative ones that we all know about the negative of the negative faces.
All of this choices in two effects of the gains about the gain.
The first parador is that producing is that fresh free.
With many options in the options where the cheap is very hard to do it.
I offer a meaning for a conducted on the piani of pensionate pensionate pensionate of pensionate pensionate ate at the time.
A connected to the Van: A founded to the Vanantes's company of thinking about a million cliently of a clienter companies.
What she found is that for every 10 solutions that are offer in the percentage of adedesion of adedesion of the airplanes of 2.
With 50 deeper per per per less than ademic adesions when they're available to when they're available to be only 5. Why ?
because with 50 foundation of the foundly hard to decidetain to decidetain the questions.
And I would be a question, and I think, of course of the questions, and of course of the question,
You know, it doesn't only mean that these work from the old hands to the food because they don't have enough money to say that the decision is so obstate is so obstate is so obstation of the dator of the work of the work of the work of the dator works.
Not they, they're losing to 5000-dollars for the dator of the dator of the dator of the dator -- that would be ben disrate them.
So the paralizes is a consequence of the way you have too much choice.
And I think it comes from the world like this.
"And for the eternite," "Petch,"
You should take the right decision -- if it's the eterness, right?
You don't want to take the wrong wrong and you don't have the wrong conditions.
So this is the first effect is that we can avoid to avoid the worth of the worth of the end of the end of the result of how we would be with less than we are being being being with less than the options that we shedoes.
And this for different reasons.
One of these is that with many conditions that are going to be a lot of people who are bought to a different choice that you could do a different choice that would be better choice that would be better than it would be better than the alternative imagined and the reduce of the choice, and the reduce the reduce of the choice, and the reduce of the respect from the decision of the surface,
even when it was a good decision.
The way you know, the choices are easy to be easy to any detail that is insound of the option of the option of the option of the option of the option of the option of the option of the option of the option of the option of the option.
And so, there's what economists call it expensive the economists called the expensive.
Dan Gilbert has a very good stamaten as the values that we do things to do things that we do things to do it.
And I mean, when there are many options that are so many options that are easy to be the characteristics of alternative alternative and being less than the option that you have choice.
Here's a example. I took me with all those who are not New York.
But that's what you probably probably think about it.
There's this copy to Hamptons.
A place of the luse.
Spivelendid. It's all for them.
I don't have to do anything. But what he thinks is "Well ell Ago."
"All my neighs in Manhattan is lived vid."
"You could talk about the front of homee."
And I spent two weeks from the idea that is lost st -- every day -- the possibility where you want to do where you want to do where you want to do a lot of words where you want to do a lot of words -- every day -- the possibility of park and a lot of worry -- every day --
The cost of opportunity to dimine the soddisfation for that we have -- even when the choice was very exciting.
And the most of the options we have to look at the characteristics of attemptions to be able to be in the opportunity.
Here's another example.
This journey tells us a lot of things.
There is about the moment, and maybe live the time of the lently.
But the most important point is that you can take your choice, you go to the others.
The things we don't take them a lot of active activity that can make less attactive what we do.
The point of the growing growing of the expectation of the expectes.
I tried to my par pairs buy a new jeans.
And I just just just jeans.
And when the jeans were a only typically bought and go to the west, they were sweet to get a lot of time, they were saved a lot of times, they start to go good.
So, I went to buy a new when the old old old when the old old old of jeans, and he said, "I need a couple of jew."
The common to me, "Li wants slim phone, and make it slide, and fit?"
You want to do with the circum? "Stone?" "Stonee" or "acee?"
"You want to do it the way to do that?"
"Who wants to be a stret? Bla's bla." Continual ba." Continy was to the wave.
I was a little bit after a little bit after I was going to say, "I want to say, "I want the only typo" -- that was the only one of what I was going to do with all the 'nest and I tried to all the '0s, then the negoties, and the negogoties that I had never been loved from the negotie and I had never loved to have been loved in the jeans that I had never been doing it.
It was the mass. I had the whole choice I had the better.

There's a critical value, which I don't know what it is.
But I'm sure we have superwar, from a piece of the level where the choices our life.
