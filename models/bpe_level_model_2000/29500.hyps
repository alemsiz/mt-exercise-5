And last year, I showed these slide to demonstrate that calculation calculation that the tartical calculus for almost three million years had had the size of the 48 percent.
But this is the gravity of the problem because it doesn't show the same.
The glacial climbing is in a certain sense, the heart climate system.
You expands of inversus and you resive the summer and well you know.
The next slide will be a rapid rapid to be a covered dried on the last 25 years.
The ice lots are signed in red red red red there.
And you can see it all to the way to the blue screen.
That's the ice ice ice in the winvere, which is return out of summer
You can see that the cosidate gite, five years or more, five years or more, it's like the blood like the blood from the body.
In 25 years it's passed to like this.
This is a problem because interested in the art of the terrain the art of the art in the ocean art where there are enormous amount of carbon that sheets are transformed in metang -- they turned out to metanch from microbies.
Reded to the totality of the atmospheric ination from global warming, that amount could double, super-hatches could be hored.

A reason is that this termic scale surround surround surround from north.
This is a regime glacial regime

These corrups are increasing rapidly increased.
On the other side of the planet: Antarcts, the largest block of the planet.
The month, the scientists have dichied that the balances of the ice is in negative and that Antarctars of Western ones on some islands under the islands in the west.

This is a whole thing of unsustainable to it.
If you look at the context of the historical context if you can see the consequences.
In the last five years we added 70 million tons of CO2 hours -- 25 million tons in the oceans every day.
Look at the East area of Pacific Pacific America, and the west, and on the west, and on the bottom of India, where there is a radical imposed in the oceans.
The major of global warming, together with deforestation, together and deforestation, which is the use.
The oil is a problem, and the carbon is even worse.
The United States are one of the two countries with the China.
And it proposed to build a lot of other carbon dives.
But we're going to assisting a direction.
These are the annulled projects in the last few years and some green alternative proposes.
At every way there is a political lotly in our country.
The carbon and the oil industries have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote the carbon the last year, which is a oxy-sides.
That picture reminded me to remind me to remind me --

This is the second biggest flow in America.
It's happened around Natmains.

The carbon is between the main of the main scale of global warming, but the night technology of the carbon that you see changes everything that you see changes everything.
You look at a ey: this is the charcoal technology of clean opping clean.

Thank you very much.
The year last year, I was a introducing on LHC.
And I promise to return to you back to how machine.
And I got it. And for those who the other time you didn't have the other time in the LHC is the biggest scientific experiment ever I had to have a circumstomer surrounds.
His to reader the conditions that were less than a billion pounds than a billion in the universe -- until 600 million times a second.
And all this is simply simply environment.
This is the Gineva.
We picture these mini-Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Big Bang Big Bang Big Bang Bang Bang Big Bang Bang Bang Big Bang Big Bang Big Bang Bang Big Bang Big Bang Big Bang Big Bang Big Bang Big Bang Big Bang Big Big Big Bang Bang Bang Bang Big Bang Bang Bang Bang Big Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Big Bang Big Big Big Big Big Big Bang Big Bievg B
This is what I work. It's called ATLAAS -- it's four feet and it's a 4-feet and has a 22 feet of feet --
This is a picture of ATLAALAATLAAS in building so you can see the proportions.
The 10 seeptember 10 year, we have access, we have access,
And this picture was taken by ATLAS.
It was immenses in the controls in the control.
It's a picture of the first particles of particles that had done all the board, and he had all the journey of LHC, and deliberately, and diffundult particles inside the LHC, and spread particles inside the resilievator.
In other words, when we saw that picture the 10 set, we realized that the machine works, the one that is a great liftyle --
I don't know if it was to do us exploded this when someone went to Google and saw that the page was this --
That means we had a cultural impact of that scientific impact.
About a week later, there was a problem with the machine, had to these films here -- these files -- these files -- these files -- these files.
These films take 13,000 feet when the machine works in the maximum of power.
Now, the technical technical of you look at the files and say, "It's not true. I'm filming too underneath it."
And it can do because when they are very cosidy become the sound cosid-called superconvicts.
So, at least 271 degrees, a further temperature in the space between the stars, these files can bring that corrent.
In one of the most of the most of the magnets in the LHC, there was a fabrication.
So the files surprised and the 13,000 feet meet and 13,000 ample feet meet to meet a resilience of electric.
This was the result.
Now, this is even more impression, if you think that these magnets are 20 tons than 20 tons -- and that have moved about 30 centimeters.
They are damaged about 50 magnets.
We had to take you to take it out.
We have repristine and add additive.
They're now going back to their place under the ground.
Entro the end of LHC will be new integry.
We're going to accept and we expect data or jugging data or him, and continuing so our adventures are the matts that are the universe.
Now, of course, in a certain quite a certain fairly over the value of the value of science and engineers. It's easy to constate. It's easy to confuture.
I think that the fact that it is so difficult to go beyond the limits, I think this is the value of things like LHC.
I want to end with the words of a scientist Ingless, Humphrey Davy, what, Humphresid-to-useful experiments of his pup, his pupill, his pups of the Michael Faray, he said, "No is a dangerous for the human mind that the resid-des of the human mind that are not in nature of human minds, which are not going to be completely new world."
Thank you.
I want to start asking you to rethink about here, from children, played with a children, played matter matter matter to the baby.
And as you realized them and reach them and reach them and reach them and they can learn them and learn them to think and resolve them to think and resolve problems and eat thinking and hands-relationships.
The reason is is deeply connected to the way we understand part of the world around us.
So, as informed informed by using the uses of our interaction with physics, together, and my collaborator Jeevan Kalaniths, and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanith, I started asking myself as a computer, instead of the mouse as well-digital that moves on a hour of dgital path that you can deal with an information with both information with both ents of our interact with both information with with with both information of physically, information --
and we would make it live to our please?
The question was so interesting that we decided we decided we would explore the answer to the answer to the answer to the answer that we decided we would explore the answer that we decided we would explore the answer that we decided we decided we would to explore the answer that we decided we decided we would to explore the answer that we decided we decided we would have to explore the answer that we decided we decided to explore the answer to the answer.
In a few words, a Siftable computer computer computer interactive as a biscope.
In a few words, a Siftable computer computer computer interactive as a biscope.
You can move them with the hand, they can see it in their movement, and they have a wireless and they have a wireless.
But most of physics, like physics, like matter matter matter to be simply to realize it will be simply to realize them.
The Siftable is a new ecosystem of tools to manipulate information.
And as they become more physics, and as they are more physics, and as they are more physics, and as they get more physics, and as they are more physics, as we motion, we can explore and the different styles of interaction.
I'm going to start with some simple example.
This Siftable is configed to show the video -- if you including it in a direction, the video room, if you can including it out of the other side back.
These ritritical ritritters are aware of the others.
If they are interested in what they are going to be there.
If they are surround, they notice and they can agre it and they can agre a bit.
If they are surround, they notice and they can agre it and they can agre a bit.
They also have their movement and incline.
We're realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was the power to use gestures on the data, "example, a couple of as if it was a liquid.
In this case, we have three Siftable configurated secks of green and I can use them to use them to take the colors in the central central central central in the central central centers.
and I can use them to use them to take them to the color in the central centers.
If we can get a little bit of it, we can put a little bit of it.
They're also beautiful chance to learn how the languages, mathematics and games of logical logical and play things that people can try and see the results and see the results of midddle and see the immediately.
I'm going to --
This is a Fibonacus that I do with a program of of equations.
Here we have a words of words that is half between Scarabeum and Boggle.
For all turn out to every turn in the Siftable, Pratically, to every turn Siftable, Pratically, you get a house on every turn Siftable, and as you certain comport of a ditionary.
Then, after about 30 seconds remissing, and you have a new set and new chance of lects, and new possibility to try to try to try to try to try and make a new chance to try to do.
Thank you.
Here's the children came to the Middle Lab, I did it in a way that they tried them and I sang them up and I sang up and I gave them a video.
They are pleased a lot of them.
And one of the interesting things about this kind of application is that you don't have to give people a lot of education
You just have to say, "Lets of the words, and they know what to do.
Here's other people who tried it is.
This is our most youngest beta younger broad in the right.
It wanted to be actually crawles.
It just was a battonfive him.
Now, this is a application of a interactive card.
We wanted to build a tool for the appreciation of languages is Felix.
It can inserve new characters in the scene, and the Siftable to their associated associated with them.
It can inserve new characters in the scene, and the Siftable to their associated associated with them.
So it's doing it out of the sun.

Video: Vole,
DM: The last example I have time to show you is a tool, realized recently to be a recent and execk to the music.
it's a tool, realized recently to be a recently and execk and execk and music.
The Siftable here are taking sounds like based on sounds like battery.
Each of these has four different variations, and you can choose what to use it.
You can get these sounds in a sequence to a sequence to your floor.
And to modify it by doing touch a sound."
These are effects that you can control from living, as the film and the filter.
And it takes it particular to a particular and then including it to add it up.
And then there are the general effects as time and volumes, which is applicate to the sequence.
Let's look at how it works.
Video: DM: We're going to start with a base in two Sift-sequence, we system, the system, we will add the size in a series, we add other base.
I put a basic line.
Video: DM: World-to-cussion-
Video: DM: And I'm going to put the filter to the bacteria, so I can control effect of live.
Video: DM: I can fast the entire sequence the entire sequence of the time from one side or the other.
Video: DM: And I'm going to add the based filter to give more expression.
Video: DM: I can recombine the sequence of the face of the face
So I didn't have to plan to planning it before, but I can try and make it longer or the cortas.
And now, finally, I can get the entire sequence the entire sequence inclining the Siftable of the volume."
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is build new interfaces and more more and more more more and more more more and more look like our brain and body.
And I have to show you one of the results of the results of this perfect and some possibility that we try to bring out of the lab.
The concept that I want to transmit you to make this new generation of objects designed to interact with digital media that will be information in our world that we want.
Thank you very much.
I don't see the hour of you talking to all of you.
I'm a write writing.
Sclips is my professional but it's more than that, of course, of course,
It's also the love and the fashcle of my life.
And I don't aspect that can change it.
But I said, "Well, something particular happened in recent and my career, and my career, who brought me to realibrate the entire recalibrate to me with this work.
The particular thing is that I recently wrote this book, this biography called "Mangia, Prega, Ama" -- Mangia, for some reason -- for some reason -- for some reason -- for some reason -- and I became a big sensational.
And the result is that everywhere you go back to me as if I were convicted to me as if I were convicted to me.
By -- convict; convicted convict!
They come up with me and they were all worried and they say, "You don't fear than to do better?
You don't fear to continue to write for all life without power to create a book that could create a book that can make somebody book that can be able to make somebody who can you do it?"
that can be to do somebody that can you do it?"
It's running to be sure you know.
But it could go worse and I remember 20 years ago, when I started to say to people -- I was a adolescent people -- I was a train.
I meet it reaction by the feeling reaction of the fear.
And people say, "Don't you have a successful time to have success?
You don't fear that the umiliation of the refitt killed?
You don't fear to do this mester to do this mester in life without any life that was going to die on a heart of diving heads of the matter to to love ck energy with the mouth of love ck energy falliment?"
You know.
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is, "Yes."
I fear of all those things.
I always had to be fear of it.
And I also fear of a lot of other things that people might not have to ine.
And as the algain and other things like that.
But as I can write the writing thing I thought and I asked must ultimally why is?
It's rational?
It's logical that anyone to expect to be sware swelled by a work that you feel like to do.
But what is so particular in the pretty much creative to make us rect in a way that you have to make not not do?
How my father, for example, he was a chemical engineer and I don't remember one time in his 40 years of activity in which he was asked if he had been willing to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer to be engineer than one of the active active activity in which he was a chemical engineer in which he was a chem
It never was -- that block of the engineer engineer John, how do you know?
It didn't working, it workers work?
Onestly, the engineers have not certainly in the sect of the reputation of the reputation of being alcohyped reputation of maniacs in depressive.
We writer, we have this reputation, and not only writers but creative writers but creative of all generates we have this reputation of being enormously unstable to be aware of minds.
And it's not going to look at the tristay of the magnitude of magnific deaths that only are the creative creative people who are young and often for them to hand.
And the ones that you don't have suicide seem to be actually displaced by their women.
Norman Mailer, before I did, in the last interview said, "Ogny book me a little more." And one extraordinary recently about the work of their lives.
But we don't have to be able when we feel that because we heard these things that are so long that somehow we have been interior in a way that creativity and the notion that creativity and the end, and the end, it will always be in some way and end, it will always done to the angood.
And the question I want to ask all of the way is, are you agree with this idea?
It goes you go to this thing -- because it looks like me from a centimeter of me distance to me not good for anything that supposed to be a good supply --
I think it's hody.
And I think it's dangerous and I don't want to see it in the next century.
I think it's better encouraging our big minds creative minds lives.
And I know that, in my case -- in my case -- in my case -- would begin to become out to the bunch of the supposed to be a lot of dangered by the circumstances where I are in my career.
Obe, I mean look at it, I'm pretty young, I have about 40 years.
I still have about four decade of work in me.
And it's likely to be write that every time will be write in the world as the work that was going to be judged by the world as a lot of success book.
I'm going to be slavet, because we are all more or less friends here -- it's likely that my greatest success is to my splies.
Oh, Gesus, that you think of it!
You know this is the kind of thinking that brings a person to start to begin to the nine of the morning, and I don't want to do it.
I would continue to do this work that we do.
So, the question becomes to it?
And so I seem to do it and reflective to work to work on to work on to work on to create a psychological construction to create a psychological construction of protective, ok?
I have to find a distance of security security between me, and I am write, and my natural reaction of the reaction of the reaction of the reaction of the reaction of how to do it begin to look through the time in looking through the time, trying to find other societies to see if they could have some other societies to see if they could have the best ideas and seem to see if they could have the best ideas and the best write of the best ideas and I can have the best ideas and I have been write as write write w
how to help people to help people to manage to manage emotional risks emotions.
And that research has taken me to the ancient Greea and Roma.
You can see it because it turns out to go back and then back back back and then back back back and then comes back.
In the ancient Grecia and ancient Rome -- people didn't look like creativity creativity came from humans, OK?
And it was thinking that creativity was this spirit of wine and he came to a few surface and he came to a few surface and unknown for distant distant distant and unknown out.
The Greeks called these spirits of creativity and demonis."
Socrate, wonderful belief that was created to have a demon that elargiving wisdom that elargiven sage.
The Rans were of the same idea, but they were called the kind of spirit without a genius.
And that's great because the Romans didn't think that a very smart genius were somebody particularly smart.
They believed that a genius was this kind of diving entity that he believed in the walls of the study of a artist, a little bit like Dobby, and that was going to come out of the art and the result of the work of the artist of the work of the result of that work.
Excital -- et, that's the distance of which I would talk -- that psychological construction that psychological psychological that protects you from your work.
And everyone knew that was so that it working, right?
So the antic artists were protected by certain things, like the too narcism, right?
If your work was exceptional wasn't you could get all the market that you could have been helped from this encourage that was helped by this encoum that was helped by this encourage that you could have been taking out of this encourage you could get all the market, everything that was helped by this enor.
If your job, it wasn't all of your job, it wasn't it?
They knew that was your genius to be a inability.
And so people have conceived the creativity in Occident for a long time.
And then the Rinaascise came and changed this big idea; we put this big idea; we put the human being on the center of the universe and the mysteries and without leaving space to the creatures of the divinity and write of divinity and write the divinity of the divinity and the nack of the universe to the human being;
This was the principle of the rational exploded and people started to think that creativity creativity came completely from ispring.
And for the first time in history, you began to refer this argue as a rather than a genius with a person with genie.
And I have to tell you, I think it was a big error.
I think to allow someone simple person to believe to be like a recipe like a source, and the source, and the surprising of all my mysteries and fragile and ethesize that and ethesizable, unknown.
It's like to ask someone of the sun.
Deform and historically, the ego and creates all these ingestible ingestilizing ases.
And I think it was this pressure to destroy artists in the pasts in the past.
And if this is true, and I think it is, and I think it is, and now?
Can we do it different?
You might go back to a more ancient understanding of the human relationship between humans and creative mystery of the relationship.
Or maybe no.
Maybe we can't cancer 500 years of rational thinking in a 18 minutes.
And there are probably people in the audience that would be reading suspects on the notion that they follow people on the notion of the notion that they follow people who following people are going to follow their projects.
I'm going to probably not going to convince you all on this thing.
But the question I would like to ask is -- why is?
Why don't think it in this way?
Because it has more sense than any other thing that I've ever heard to explain the exaspertent impredictions of creative process.
A process, like anyone that I ever tried to do something -- so fundamentally, all here -- yes, you don't behavior.
And in fact, it can sometimes it seems completely paranormal
I did meet this meeting with the extraordinary poet, who has now 90 years, but it was a poet, which was a poetcheese, and he said that during his childhood, and he said it in the rural Virginia, working out of the road poet.
He told me that it was like a frag-track frage to the air
And he came rolling to her rolling to her landscape.
It would be to get there, because he would try to get the Earth.
It was to have a only thing to do to that point and it was to run as a morning, "run like a morn."
And it goes to the home and she would have been followed by this poetry and it would be going to take a little piece of paper and a fairly house enough in the translate and and a fairly house in the page.
Other times couldn't be quicked, so it was fast, so correced and recorded and recorded rected, and he would reach up and the rolled rolled through and she would continued to roll through and she would continue to roll across the landscape and she would go through the lands."
And then there were some times -- this piece never forget it -- there were some moments in which was almost losing the time that was almost losing almost losing and well.
And he was running at home and he was trying to card and the poetry was trying to take a major on the walk, and he said, he was like he was like if you were awalked with the other hand and and the off.
And he was the poemed poem from the coda and reputs in his body and the packed on the page.
And in these cases, the poems would be presented on the perfect and intacts and intact to the last word on the first major on the first major on the first major against the last word of the first sie.
So when I feel it -- it's crazy, it's exactly equal to my creative process to my creative process.
Not all my creative process -- I'm not a convict!
I'm a mule, and my work to work and my work is to see me at the same horarian every day and sweet.
But even in my head -- I was textboard, I striped that thing, sometimes.
And I guess that many of you have the fact that I have done.
You know, if the work and ideas and ideas and ideas I would give you a certain fundamental source.
And what is this thing?
And how can we relate to the head that we don't lose your head, but rather, rather than making headsani?
And as I can reck me about the best example I have the Tom Waits, which I interview in a day.
We were talking about that, and you know, Tom, and you know, Tom, for the magazine of life was the incarnation of the artist of the artist recentles, and trying to control, and dominate these species of creative impulses that have totally interior dominate these species of creative impulsed cleaning these species of creativity.
But then he was driving up and a day and a day when he was driving on a higher cartoons Angeles, changed all of him.
It was going to fast and all of a sent track of this sent fragments in his head as as the inspiration as the inspiration, elusive and ethetics, you know, it's wonderful and you know, it's wonderful and desire, but not how to take it.
It doesn't have a piece of paper -- it has no mathematically.
And it begins to feel this kind of old old old old old old old the top, and I'm going to lose and hmarrow obsessioned by this song persemen of this song cancer persemen
I'm not good enough and I can't do it chees."
And instead of go to the panic stopped up.
I'll go the whole mental process and made something completely new thing.
And he looked at the sky and he said, "Scuse, you can't see I'm driving I am driving it?"
"You seem that can write a song hour?
If you really want to exist, I go back to a little bit more opportunity when I can take care of you.
Other address, you go to the other other today.
You go to disturbing Leonard Cohen."
And his process changed after that.
Not work, the work was still dark as you can seem to be able to do it.
But the process, and the fish anks that would argued it was released when the genius, the genius that was out of himself and he would remained it to remaining it from the back, and realizing it was a whole thing that had to be an interior reted.
but well, this wonderful piece of bizarre collaboration a conversation between Tom and this strange thing between Tom and external thing that was not Tom.
So I feel that story began to change a little bit of a way I worked and save me a little bit of a time I was working and save me a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a time I worked on a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a lot of the way I would be a little bit of a little bit of a way that
This idea, saved me when I was writing "Mangia, Prule, and the falls of the disperation in one of those class of the disperation where we all are working on something and we couldn't think that be a disaster that will be a worst book book that that that the worst write.
Not only bad book.
And I started to think about design this project.
But then I remember Tom that talked to about the air and try to do.
So I went to my face on the hands and I would say my comments to a crangle.
And I said, "Yes, well, both both both both you know, both that if this book won't be brilliant not be brilliant not be brilliant not be brilliant not be by?
Because as I can see, I can put all of what I haven't have more than that.
So if you want to be better and do your party.
Okay. But if you don't have to do it -- I don't have to do anything there.
I'm going to write write the same because it's my job.
And I would like to have a recorded that I today today I represented to me to do my part, because of the end of the North Africa -- the end of North Africa's deserts in North African African dances and the dances and the mother, and the mothers and the alb.
And they were always magnants, because the ballers were professionals, and they were fantastic.
But every single time, rary, something happened, and one of these artists became across reality became across reality.
And I know what I know about it, because I know that you view all of a point, a performance like that.
It was like time stopped and the ballerine walking through a kind of land-walking species and it wasn't doing anything different from the sun, as 1,000 before that, but all of all the way you have a different kind of -- but all of allineated alphysical and the walking species --
And suddenly it doesn't look like a human one.
But you access to go into the dilt and under the divinity of divinity of divinity
And when this happened to the day, the people who were going to call it with his name.
They had their hands and they were going to sing, "Ah, Do o, God."
That's God, you know.
Curiosa story -- when the Mors the Souna, they preserve this habity, they preserve this habited and pronounced the centuries and printed in the Sou," which you can still feel in "Okah, Allah," that you can still feel in the flamen.
In Spana, when a artist made something impossible and magic -- "Ah, oh, oh, hole, and hole, and behincommercible, extent -- a foot of God.
And it's great because we need to do.
But the problem goes the day down, the ballery ballery when you wake up and discovers that are the 11 morning and discovered the Dod is not more.
It's just a mortal death with the knes to the knes, and maybe it can't be going to get that alist to get that althize.
And maybe no one dog will be the named God as I go, and what to do with the rest of his life?
It's hard to do.
This is one of the most dulorous reonciliations to make a creative life in a creative life
But maybe it doesn't have to be so anguy if you can not believe -- that you don't believe it -- that the most examples of your being being as you can be as well as you can be as well as you know.
But it destics you have data from a instances from a instincluding this squisite life that you have to go to someone else when you go to somebody else when you finished.
And you know, if we think in this way.
And so I started to think about it, and it's sure as I thought for several months during the jobs of the book that public book that public I will have a dangerous charge that I would have been down.
And what I have to keep when I feel eling when I feel electried to be -- not going to be fear that I don't fear I have to keep fear I have to keep fear I have to keep on the electric when I feel eling to go out of this is, I feel eling to go out of this is, I don't fear that I fear that I have to continue to tell me when I feel like
Don't go argue.
Continues to presentate you to you get you to be there.
If your work is ball, dance, ball, ball.
If the drum, you know, he would assumption to leave some kind of wonderful scale some kind of wonderful time through your efforts through your efforts through your efforts of wonderful time through your efforts of wonderful time through your efforts of wonderful time through your efforts of wonderful things, and you know, "Ole!"
Other triments, you do the same tube.
And "Ole!" to yourself the same.
I think you have to teach it out.
"Ole!" to yourself the same, even for human and test love and test talks to to you can represent you continuously to make you continuously in the way.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
And as you know I talked about some of these projects on human genome genome of what can means and discovering again, and discovered again.
We're starting a new fairly new wast: we started digitalizing biology and now to go from that code and now from that code and now we are getting into a new phase of biology, designing and synthesithetic and synthesizing and synthetic and cutting lives.
We always tried to take a big questions.
"What is the life?" is something that many biological biological I think they have tried to understand various levels.
We tried to be approach to the minimes of terms --
We're digitalizing from almost 20 years old.
When we sequenced the human genome was treating from the analogical world of biology in the digital world.
Now we ask us to regenerate our lives, or creating new life from this digital universe from this digital universe
This is the map of a small organism, the Mycoplasma genitalium, which is the most smallest species between those who can authoreplicate in lab.
And we tried to reduce the genome to create a little bit smaller.
We're able to eliminate a hundred genes of the 500 that are here.
But when we look at his map of metabolic map of metabolic map respect to the now.
You're going to be simple
But when we look at all the genes we can heliminat, one to the time, it's very improbably that this can bring to a liver cell cell that this can bring to a live.
So we decided that the only via to progress was synthesize this chromosomes in a way that we could modifit to make some of these fundamental questions.
And so we started the wind of the "Poses we synthesize a cromom that we can syry?"
Can chemical consequent to produce these big molecules that we never have to create before we have never create before?
And in fact, we can make a cromoso-making cromosic chromoso-
A chemical chemical material is just a piece of inert material chemical material
The speed with which we are able to digitalize the life is growing up to exponential rectal of the reality-fell-range fring.
Our ability to write the genetic code, progress descenes, but it's better than they are better.
And our recently recently recently the door recently recently recently
We started 15 years ago.
The process has a lot of past, beginning with a biothic revision before we began to be the first experiments.
But we discovered that synthesize DNA is very difficult.
There are thousands of machines in the world that produce small segments of DNA, the moons of 30 to 50 feet and it's a degeneration process is a degeneration process is longer than the segment is longer than the segment.
So we had to develop a new methodd to assembling these fragments and rect the middle of the middle and rect the middle of the middle and rect the middle of the middle and rect the middle of the framments and rect to assemble.
And this was our first tentative trigger, to particular information of Phi genome of Phi X 174.
It's a little virus that kills killing bacteria.
We designed the errors and made the correction of the errors and I had a DNA molecule.
And the interesting part is when we took this piece of inert material chemical material and we put it into the bacteria began to read this genetic code and producing the viral-to-particles in viral-year-old matter particles in virals.
The virals are then released by cells, they were released by cells, and they destroyed Ellands.
I talked about recent recent members of oil, they tried to them that they certainly beended that they certainly been.
They have more than you.
We believe that this is a situation where software can actually build his own hardware in a biological system.
But we wanted to do things in bigger and the things in bigger.
We wanted to build the entire chromosome.
I'm more than 580 miles of genetic code of genetic code.
So we thought to build it in cassets of viruses, so that we could change the cassets to understand what the cassets are a living cell.
The projection is crucial crucial information in a computer, these have to be very accurate information in a computer, these must be very accurate to be very accurate information in a computer, these must be very accurate information in a computer, these must be very accurate information in a computer, these must be very accurate information to be very acc
When we sequence this genome for the first time in 1995 the accuratezation was a standard of a mile error for every 10 miles my basis.
We discovered, resequence and 30 herrors. If we used that original sequence we never have been able to do it work.
One part of the process is to design, 50 letters that are going to be object with all other segments of 50 letters to build 50 letters to build under the tiny works.
We roject elements here.
You probably read that we read that we put in the phylie.
Think of this thing -- we have a genetic code genetic code.
Three of those letting together together with about 20 friendous lectures about 20 friends for every admino-to-letting orders for every admino-acid pacid of letting in the lects.
So we can use genetic code to write words, fraise thinking.
What we did at the beginning was automo-fairly to be automated.
Some were deluses from the fact that it wasn't ched by the fact that it wasn't ched.
We designed these segments to simply them unique to simply them to unique.
There are gain that they repaid them and put them and put them together.
And we started assembling the parts, starting with five to seven a seven miles away from a seven miles of 24 miles aaway from 24 miles a lectages to get 72 miles to come 72 miles an letter.
And every step we product these segments in abundance so that we can sequence them that we're trying to make a remarkable procept that we're trying to create a extremely robbrobbust -- as you will see in a minute.
We're trying to automatize the process.
So, this seems the tabon a basket.
When we go to these very longments very long-hundred miles aren't growing more directly in Ellles.
You get to the limited tools of the molecular tool.
So we have to look at other mechanisms.
We knew about another mechanism called recombination called recombination of homology to repaid the DNA in biology to repair DNA to move the segments.
Here's an example.
This organism, called Deinococcus radiodurans, it can assumptions of radiation.
You can see in the soft requarter as his cromosome.
In 12 -- 24 hours is reassembled exactly as before.
There's thousands of organisms that are able to do it.
These organisms can set completely sily.
They can live under a nice thing.
I'm absolutely sure that life existed in space, and you move to find new environments of water environments
In fact, NASA showed that this living that this living lives.
This is a picture of the molecules we built using these process, just using the boards, just using the design of the gments of the gments of the gator segments of the molecule.
The lievid them automatically awful lievidence.
This picture was not taken with a electronic microscope with a microscope to rule.
It's a molecule, that we can see it with a microscope law.
These are photograph that are a period of about six seconds.
This is the published that we did a little time ago.
I'm more than 580,000 letting code code of genetic code.
It's the biggest molecules that we have ever created by man.
It has a molecular weight in 300 million of them.
If we would take it with a 10 cararacter, you would just take 142 pages to get this genetic code.
Now, how do we do it work?
Of course, we track a virus.
It's a little bit more complicated when you use bacterial bacteria.
It's also simpler when it's about eucarios as our real eucarios like our res: you can simply the nucleus and put up another one another, which is practically the clonation process of clonation
In the bacterium archaea is instead of integrated inside the cell but we recently demonstrated that we are able to do a complete trapis that we are able to do a cell phone and activate to another and activate it to another and active it.
We can have a cromosome, in a cromosome.
The two are different than the tops from the topis.
We have added some genes in a way that we could decide what choose to chromom for this chromom
And it turns out to killing all the proteins.
And when we put it in the cells was stuff -- and you open our choicatoes -- and you open our softwo-to-cell phone -- the new cell phone in the cellphone --
And we started thinking we couldn't go beyond that, but we tried to be done in the time.
This is one of the major mechanisms of evolution.
We discovered that many species have added a second or a third of a second or a third of a second hundreds of new tracks in a second thousands of new tracks at that species.
So who think of evolution as a gene of a gene when you modifies it didn't understand part of the biology.
There's the gain called restrial restrial of restrion is that degerist digerist DNA.
The chromosome, which was in the cell phone doesn't have one.
The cell phona-cell phona-cell that we put it up-ha.
You can see it is expressed the other cromosome, as a extract as an extract as a cell and we found us with only the cell and the new cell and the new cell and the new cell and the new crumoso-like material material.
it became blue because of the genes we put on.
And in a short of time, all the characteristics of a species are gone in a species and it turned out of the new species, based on the new species, which we put in the cellule.
All the proteins have changed, the membranes are changed, and when we read the genetic code of exactly on what we have transferred you.
Now, this could look at the genetics but altering the software DNA we can change things in a fairly substantial enough to change things in a fairly substantial enough to change things in a fairly substantial software as a genetic.
Now, I have already explained that you don't talk about genesis -- but to progress from three million years from evolution, and I told that we are to create a new version of the Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosion of new species on this digital process,
Why do that?
I think it's obvious when we think of our necessity.
We're going to spend six billion people at nine billion people in the next 40 billion in the next 40 years.
I am to give you an example: I was born in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for each one in 194, there are going to be four years, there are are going to be four years.
We're going to find out in a few hunger and clean water and clean and clean and bashion, and a half half billion people.
It will be more harder, to do it for nine billion us.
We are more than five billion carbon dives, more than 30 billion barrels.
That means a hundred million barrels to a day.
When I try to find biological processes or any kind of process, or whatever you can get a huge challenge to be a huge challenge to be a huge challenge to be a huge challenge of trying to get biological challenge to be a huge of processes to get biological processes to find biological challenge.
And we have to keep it to all the way the CO2 emission of these materials that finished in the atmosphere.
At day, thank you for scientific discoveries in the world, we have a database with about 20 million genes, and I like to think that are the project that are the projected components for the future.
The electronic industry has only a dozen size of components, and think about how many different things are coming.
Our limited here are data principlely by biological reality and our imagination.
We've got techniques, thanks to these synthesization, in graph of synthesization, in graph of creating what we call genomics.
We're able to build a big robots that can produce a robots a million chromosomes.
Think of processing these 20 million different genes of different genes or try to get the processes to produce optimize the processes or drugs, we can change a little team, and we can change a little team, and create bigger molecular biology in the last 20 years.
And it's just a standard set leson.
We can choose to choose survival, chemical production or chemical carbant, production chemical production, production of vaccines
This is a few software software programmed in a few software programmed to be able to seat us and designing species in the computer.
Well, we don't know necessarily like they will be done.
We know exactly what their genetic code.
We're concentrate on the four of four-generation.
You can see you who extract you that extract was a finished experiment in the slide of the floor.
We've got a second and third generation that will be using enough pretty soon as a zero enough path of the higher as the either types of butanol.
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without major impact a large impact of the food and limiting the CO2 mooth in primatter, which we are working for cells that we are working for cells to be transforming this discover, and we think we could reach this discover, and we think we could have the first carbon diving of food generation in about 18 months.
The solar light to CO2 is a methodom -- but in our discoveries in the world, we found different metodis.
This is a organism that we described in 1996.
It lives in the ocean deep about 2500 feet of depth of the water perature of the water ching eboildition of water.
It made the CO2 from CO2 using molecular energy like sources of energy sources.
We're trying to understand if we can see if we can instead of CO2, which can easily be transported tubes, converting that CO2 in charburant, to drive this process.
So we can increase think we could increase be able to increase what the basic question that the basic question is Noe, truth, and we have the modest goal to replace the entire industry.
Exactly if you don't do it from TED, where can you do that?
It would become a major of energy source.
But we're working for using the same metods to create vaccines to create vaccinstant.
You saw this year with the influence and a dollar and a dollar and a dollar in less when it treates it is to find out the right vaccine of the right --
I think that this can change build vaccinable changes in ancient an.
Here's how the future could begin to change it seems to change it, the tree of evolution, accelerating evolution with synthetics, and indeed, and infinally cells.
We're so much more like to improve people.
Our purpose is to live enough to try to make it cels to try to do it for thank you very much.
First of all I'm going to show you the most quickly possible, some fundamental job, the new technology that we took Microsoft in a water in a year ago in a fact, that we have been doing.
It's a environment where you can interact to interact with a huge amount of visual data that remote data from visual data --
We're seeing a lot of gigabytes of digital photograph with a kind of zoom and continue, to a speed slips and continued to be able images as we want to do.
And it doesn't matter how big we see how big we see it, how big we see how big we see that data or images.
Most of the photographs -- but this for example, this for example, is a provenient from Bilibrary Bilibrary of Congress, and it comes in the gamma of 300 megapixel.
It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that limitation is the number of a system like this is the number of place in any moment. It's also an architecture in any moment.
This is a book of data data of data not images.
This is the Dickens. Every Casa desolatate; every single represents a chapter.
And to show you that it's a text of text and not images, we can do a thing of the general representation of a representation of the representation of the text of the text of the text of the textbook.
It could be a little bit of artificial to reading a electronic book a electronic book a little bit of electronic book.
You don't look at it.
This is a more realistic. It's a number of a Guardian.
Each image is the beginning of a section.
And it gives you really pleasure and beautiful experience to reading the version of a view or a newspaper of a newspaper of a lot of half a very much middle of meet.
We also did something with the corner of this particular number of Guardian.
We created a fasulla fasulla high resolution, much higher than what you use in a normal published -- and we had inserve in a publish.
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile, you can see here.
Or other models, or even specific specific specific and techniques.
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate limits of spaces on the screen.
We're going to put up with the pop-up and other similar and other similar bring and other similar to be necessary.
Of course, maping is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology.
And I don't want to lose a time if you don't want to say that we have contributes to give it in this field.
These are all the roads in the U.S. obstered image of NASA.
So now we go to something else.
This is actually actually from the view on the web; you can go to see it.
It's a project called Photosynth, which combine two different technologies.
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual researching on the Noah Snavely, a student of the University of Washington, with the aid of Steve See Steve Seliski of Microsoft Resear. Szeliski Resear. Sigh-to-collaboration.
And it's from Seadragonononce the web, gestures.
You can see it when we do this kind of screen where we can go from one picture of the other and have this kind of experience to the other kind of resolution in the multiple.
But the collocaon space of the images here has actually actually actually a meaning.
The algorithms of visualization have recorded these images together, so that they correspond to the real real things that you have the real real things that -- all the neighborhood in the Grashes on Montags -- have been taken canadied -- have been taken dog -- you drops of a slide-flide-stable panoramic space.
I don't know if I have time to show you some other environment.
There's a lot more space.
I want to go directly to one of the original data set of Noah-- and this proof Photosynthosynth-to-time -- to show you what I think we did work.
We had to worry about legal and saying.
This is a reconstruction of Notre Damce, Dame pictures if Flickr. Basta digitate Dame in Flickr. And you get images of these kinds of phylickr. And you get images of these connections and you can get a picture that you can see a picture that you have a picture that is discovered to this model.
So I have all picked up to Flickr and they were all colleged to space in this way.
And it's possible to navigate in this simple way.
You know, I would never have thought of finish to work for Microsoft.
It's very free to receive this kind of acres here.
I think you can see that it's a lot of different kinds of focuses of amere: from those of the cell phone of the SLR, a T-SLR, a matter number of of different physical physical physical physical physical photos in this environment.
And if you can try to try to try to look at those strange.
Most are blocked to do -- etc.
And in some part here is a series of photographs -- etcol.
This is a Notre poster Dame recorted.
We can go from the poster poster view of this environment.
The essential point is that we can do with social environment. This is taking data from the entire memory of the collective of view -- and it collects of view -- and it collects together.
All of those photograph become colleged together, more than the slights.
You have a model of the entire land that will emerge.
Think about this as the Stephen Lawler work.
It's something that grows in complexity as people using it uses to use. And the people use.
Their photograph skets are hunged by other people.
If someone is the idea of contrast all these several sames of the name of Notre Damday, Notre Dame suddenly in Notre Damday, and I can use the data, and I can use the data, and I can use me in the space, in that universe, in that universe, in that universe, in that universe, and have a social experience of the space, and have a cross-s-user experience of the swell-s-shot experience of the swallows
Of course, a consequence of all this is a consequence of all interesting part of all interesting part of the Earth, rather than the planet -- not only as the plane and satellite and similar memories and similar with memories and similar to collective.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I realized it? What your software going to have to be able to do is that at some point, in the next few years on the next years, all the photographs who were practically college that everyone in the interor the world will be practice to be practice.
BA: Yeah. What is doing is doing is actually discovered.
It's creating hyperlins, if you want to hyperlin, between images.
And it's doing it in the base content of the images.
And it becomes very interesting if you think of the wealth information that many of these images possibly images that many of these images possibly have to education of these images possibly the reality of these images possibly images that many of these images possibly have seed information that many of these images possibly have been interesting in if you think of these images possibly education of these images possibly have to education of these pictures possibly education of these images possibly images.
And as you make a research, you told a web, you told a sentence and the head of the web is about the pictures of information about the pictures of the pictures.
Now, what if that picture is college to all your picture?
And the amount of interconnection, and the amount of recheess that it comes really enormous that is really enormous effect of the net.
CA: Blaise, it's really amazing.
BA: Thank you very much.
One of the major when you travels travels and delies of research is the power to live between who didn't forgeted the anti-traditions, between the traditions, between the wind of the wind of the place of the place of the place that you can live the plants.
Basti is traveling Jaguar jaws still traveling the Lattea, or that the Miths are still holds of Inuit -- or that in Himalaya, the budds are still going to remind the respiring of the anthropologia, to remind the importance of the anthropologie, and that the world we live not exists in a sense of reality, but it's only a model of reality, but it's a model of reality,
the consequence of a particular choices that our stirps that our stirps have done or malmost like a lot of generations.
And of course, we all share of essential trates.
We all enjoyed. We're going to be right.
We're dream of the beginning of beginning.
We need to deal with the inexorability of death, so we don't surprised and ballies --
we all have a art of art.
What it is the particular is the particular song, the ritical range, the ritical dancing of every culture.
It doesn't matter that they are the Dan forest of the Borneo, or the Haiti, or the Haiti, or the Haiti, or the Curban Reerer's desert in Kenya sect-re-scent in the Sahara.
He was my journey company in the desert of journey in the desert of yak yak in yak in the Qomolang, the demomother dels of the world.
All of these populations teaches are other ways of thinking about it, other ways to think about it, other ways to think about it, other ways to move in the world.
And if you can give a moment, it's a concept that can give you hope.
And so we can see the cultures of the world create a spiritual life and cultural life and cultural ral ral raise and is important for the benigh of the planet and it's important for the benibe of the planet as biosphere.
And you can think of this ragnate; you can think of the etho-a-a-a-a-a-sum etho-to-a-a-to-a-a-a-inspirations, dreams, hydrows from the human albe.
The ethnose is the fantastic patrimonum
It's the synthy of what we are and what we can be in as a species of what we can be in the species.
And as the biosphere was free floored high-rected, and it was happened to the ethodamentally faster and purch.
No biologist, for example, it would say 50 percent of all of the species was or the extinction of all the species of the apocality, or -- in the most apocalitics -- in the most advanced diversity -- and you don't have near ar the most optimistic diversity -- that is the most optimistic diversity -- that of the cultural diversity -- that is that the 50-centurral diversity -- that is a biological diversity of the species of the species of the biological diversity -- and the
The indication of all of this is, of course, the language.
When you were born, there were 6,000 languages on this planet.
One language is not only by a vocabolary or from a series of rules of rules gram class.
One language is the size of human spirit spirit of human spirit spirit of human spirit spirit language.
It's the middle with which animation animation is in the material in the material in the material in the material.
Each language is a forest of mind, a wine, a thinking, a thinking, a pensive system.
And of those 6,000 languages, as we are here sitting here in Monterey, at least half the children, least half the children.
They don't get teached to children, which means you don't change something, which means you don't change something, which is already dead.
What is more than being sad than being fly with the silence of the last tongue talking to a language of the last tongue to be able to transmit the wisdom of the daughter?
This is a fashion a few weeks in some part of the world every two weeks a few weeks a well and brings with head and bring it in the tombs of a anguguguguguguguguguguguguguy.
And I know that someone of you will tell "Is it not like that?
The world would not be a better place if we were all the same language?" Benish synism -- we talk all the same language. We talk about the single --
Let's talk about kogi.
You will be able to be able to tell your language to be not talking to your language.
I would like to make you a journey through ethnowise.
a little journey in etho-camp.
Most of us forget, when I say, "different different ways of existing existing really different ways of existing exist.
Let's take this bimbo Barasana, in Amazon in Amazon the anaconia -- the people who believe in the anaconda, which creates in the middle of the best sandwill.
It's a popular popular that it doesn't have to distinguishing the blue colors because the time celests is identified in the forest, which is identify in the forest, which is identify dependent in the forest because it dependent ded.
They have strange language and a mathematician and a regular regular rules that are language, "You have to get a person who talks to a different language.
And all of this has radicated in the past, all of the particular cholds, is that in these families are talking about six or seven language because of the mysts of the marriages that are talking about six or seven language.
They listening to listening and then they start talking about.
We take one of the most interesting tribes that I lived in the Waoranan Ecuador of Ecuador Ecuador who had the first contact in 1958.
In 1957 mission missionaries have tried to a cometting horror in fact,
They made up from the high photographs that were retased with friendly retendled that this population of the plug forgets out of the plug forest, it had never seen anything of bi-dimensional exploital.
They collected the photograph of the Earth, they have grunning to a shape or a figura -- they have concluded that was the divole, and they have killed the five mission with the sive milarge.
But the Waoran didn't kill the strangers.
They kill it must kill them.
The five percent of mortality was caused by them to their own own own own own own own own own own own own stones.
We're risalitites to eight generations and we found two natural death cases and we found it in a lost of them who was death that one was dead, and then they killed it was a mind that they died it was a knowledge of the forest that they had a knowledge of the forest.
The cactors were able to recognize the urine animal's going to recognize the species.
In the first years '80s, I was assigned a very interesting compit when my Haiti professor Haititi asked me if I wanted to go to Haititi in the Upse of Duvalier societies and TontMacoutes and Tonton and TontMacoutes and Tonton and TontMacoutes and myself from the sessay zomes.
To give a sense of miracle I should have to understand the Vodouble culture Vodouble.
It's a very complex of a metaphysics of the world.
Most interesting.
If you ask me to tell you the big religions of the world, what would you say?
Cristian; Buddhym, Buddhism, etc.
A continent is always left out of it, and thinking that sub-Saharan Africa-Saharan Africa-s; and the Voodoo is not what distilled to these religious conceptions of none of these religious conceptions in the tragics of the slave of the slave of the slave of the slavism.

If you start to look at that these cultures can create different reality, you can start understanding some sensations. We take this plant. We take take this plant. We take this plant.
I took this picture to open the norm-Amazon the normcks.
Maybe some of you have heard about the ayahuasca, the most powerful psychoactive repertor of the repertor of the sciamanic repertor of the sciamanic repertor of you have heard about the ayaxca, the most powerful psychoacactive of ayaxcle of the ayaayaaxco-ayaaxco-ascacal repertor of you have heard about the ayayaxccoact sayayayayayay repertapaxascaascaaxase,
What makes it fascinating the ayaxis not the potential dyaxis not the dyag of the character, but his elaboration. It's compon from two elements.
On one side, this liana line that you have a series of beta-carbolines, harmines and harmwered hard.
Prending the only plant is a blue smoke that alters a little bit of the consciousness that alters with the floats of a house of the coffee of the coffee of the coffee of virids.

To that walking on the nose is a little bit like being sparated by a little bit like to be sparated by a pink of a pink of the electricity of reality, it creates a distortion, creates a distortion.
I was often with my professor, Richard Evan Shultes, the man who flew the psychedelic, with his psychedelic, with his discovered functions in the '30s in Mexexico.
And I think of my testhesis you can classifix hallucinogens because if you don't tell anybody to tell anybody to be able to tell anybody to be able to tell anybody of being aware of an awful because they have money to be absolutely because they have money from a classified in the intestine-like holds.
It's possible to assummers only if you assumptions, you know, MAO.
Now it's the beauti: the beta-carbon that liana are inbitors of MAO, the same kind of needs MAO, the same kind of potentiate trip to potentiate the trip of 80,000 species of plants, like these popules are these popules in a floor, but if you combine in this waste of a biochemical version of the particular version of the particular version of the particular version of the particular thing?
We use the great euphemism and the mistake and the error, which can be reveal to be revealed with it.
But if you ask Indians, they will tell us "The plants speak to us --
What does it mean?
This tribe, Cof, Cofan, 17 variety of ayahuasca, who died out in the forest, and that we would come in the forest, and we would come in the same species.
If you ask them how they are going to be their tassonomy will tell us "I thought I was going to realize the rest of the rest doesn't know all of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest doesn't knowledgurbsonomy rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the tasseasseasseassonoms are I I will I I
The solution is, you take 17 variety in a night of a float night and each other.
With you don't have Harvards, but it's much more interesting than to contact the stames.
Now, the problem is that the problem is that the ones that have heart of us who have heart people have heart them in a way to make a few way to the margin a reduct in the real world of reduced history of reduction.
In fact, 300 years, between 300 years, it won't be remember or the wars or wars or its innovations or its technologic innovations that we were stopped and we have been actively accepted and we have been actively accepted the destruction of the biological diversity and the problem is not change.
All cultures across the century have been involved in a dance for new possibility of lives.
And the problem is not the technology.
Indians have no matter being Sioux when they put out of part of the Americans when they put out of Americans don't have stopped to be Americans when Americans have put out of Americans and head.
It's not changing or technology that they threat integrity of ethnowell. It's the power.
The face of domination.
And if you give a look at the world, you will discovered that these are not destined cultures to disappear.
They're living creatures and dynamics out of identifiable forces that are going to beyond their ability to adaptation of their adaptations of adaptations that are adaptations of adaptations that are going to be dynamics and dynamics out of identified by identifiable forces that are going to be dynamics and dynamics are beyond of the living of the fashions.
What you can see you disbox in the path of the guy of the guy --

Or in the case of Yanomi, are the diseases that have come with the hor.
If we move on the Tibet, where I'm doing a lot of research where I'm doing a lot of researching the face of political domination.

And you can't understand the Tibet of Tibet until you don't see part of the beginning.
I have a hundred miles away from Chinina in the Western China through the Tibet of Tibet in Lhasa with a young young and college, but only reached I realized what we heard about the statistics we feel about it.
6,000 world-crowd world's sacred reduced in the wall.
1.2 million people killed from military Rvoluion.
The dad of this guy was ascritten Lama.
which means that it was killed to the Chinese invasion of the Chinese invasion

The Tibet of Tibet can be instable, but the spirit of the population is from tener to keep present.
And it turns out to a choice.
We want to live in the world, or we want to live the policy?
The great anthropologioga Margaret Mead, before she dies said that his greatest fear was that in our world, we don't just see the whole gamma of human imagination of the human imagination of the human imagination of the human imagination of reduced thinking about it and we will walk up to a day, but a day we would forget us to be more possibilities.
And it's egging to remind that our species is existed for 600,000 years.
The Neolitics Rvolution that has given us the agriculture, which has done us to the cult of the seeds in the slide of the slide of the class of the specialization, and we were the claserarchia of specialization, and we talk about 10,000 years ago.
The industrialized world has been 300 years.
That slide story doesn't suggests that we have the answers to all the challenges that we have the answer to to be able to come up in the millenniver.
When these myriades of cultures are asked what it means to be human, respond with 10,000 different voices.
And it's in these answers that we all all risk risk we all responsible to be what we are like, a consciousness that has to make a way that all the people are going to do that all the people are great time of optimism.
I took this picture on the north of Bufacturing in the Bufacturing of the Buil's isola bals with Inuit, and this man, Olaya, he told me the wonderful story of his grandgrandfather.
The canadese is not always always have been gentled with Inunuit and in the '50s to stabilive our sound in the himself in colonies.
The grandfather of this man came up with this man refusing them.
The family, I found for his life, he took all the arms and all of his arms and all of his rects.
You need to know that Inuit isn't the freedow, the freedom to the freeze.
The slands in the origin origin in origin in the origin shared skin the hat.
The grandfather of this man doesn't make it intimid of the night or blizartic or blizarts or blizarts that would suffer hyds.

We want to talk about hors? And then, in different way? And this, in different ways, and this is the synthes: [Apple] is the synthy of the resilience of the world's popules of all indigens in the world.
In the open 1999 the canades government deed to Inuit to Inuit it to the Inuit of an Ethize of a California and Texmyself together.
It's their new path. It's called Nunavut. It's called Nunavut.
It's a territory territory. They are all the resources.
One of a beautiful example of how a country that was to reconciliate with his popule.
And finally, I think it's pretty obvious at least at least to those who have been in these remote areas of the planet, realized that they don't have remote that they don't remote remote remote that they don't remote remote that they don't have been in the remote areas.

And they represents of human imagination that they risaling up the albasis. And for us all the way of these children, like the dreams of our children, become part of our children, become part of the hope.
For finally, we are National Geographic we are convinced that politicians will never get anything to nothing to do about it.

Thank you.
I'm going to talk about some things I wrote in this book that hope to recall other than I hope to recall some other that you have heard and provery, very few of them in the case doesn't have them in the case of the notaste in the case doesn't have any of the notaste.
I want to start with what I call "the official dog.
The offical officer of thing?
The dogma official society of all the Western industrial societies -- "If we want to massimize the well-being that is to massimize the bend of our citizens."
The reason for a side, in the fact that freedom is in the fact that freedom is precious, useful for human beings.
On the other is that if we are liber, each of us can act to do all massive to do all massive to do all massive our beneath in name.
The way to massize the freedom is to massive the choice.
More choices people are liberty, more libereat, and most of the freedom, more than their beness.
That, it's so deeply radicated in society that nobody would be dreams to put it into the two-hand-hand-hand up.
And it's also deeply radicated in our lives.
I'm going to show you some examples of what the progress has possible.
This is my supermarket. It's not particularly big them.
I allow a simple named on the conditions.
In my supermarket there are 175 conditions, without containing the 10 vets of oil oid oil and 12 acets across the balsamic that you can buy to make a huge number of conditions, and the circumstances in the circumstances of your dectly involved in your circuments is of your dectly.
That's the supermarket.
And then you go to the snegotid of electronic to buy a stere: casses, CD, fradio, plast, practice.
And in this single snegotial of electronic electrons in this single negotiats.
We can make six million different and a half of different combinations that are in a negotid.
You have to admit that there is a lot of choice.
Other trans -- the world of communications.
One time, when I was a child, you could get all the service phone services desired, and they could get all the service cell phone that were evidenced with mamBell.
He read the phone didn't buy the phone it didn't buy it.
One consequence of that, in the other, was that the phone doesn't road it out.
These days.
We've got a variety of phones, especially illitated variety between cellphones, especially between cellphones.
Here's the cell phones of the future.
My favorite is the MP3, MP3, cutting the nose of the nose and form in the crush for crus.
If you have not seen in the hopen negotiate in the case, you're well certain that you will pretty soon again.
And what happens is that people entering in the negozes and does this question and does this question. And you know what the answer?
It's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn't make too many things.
So, in other aspects of life that are much more important than the water of the same explosion.
Assistance is: Exxal: it doesn't happens in the United States you have to do.
And he went to the doctor, and the doctor says, "Okay, we could do A, or B" "A, we could do A, or B" and these risks." "Bs have these risks?"
You say, "Dr, what would I have to do?"
And the doctor says, "Addrop and these risks, and BBs these risk."
"What do you want to do?"
And you can rebat, "Dr. If she was what to do?
And the doctor: "But I'm not here."
The result we call it "the autonomy of malato," expression that it seems to be a good thing.
But in fact, it's not that one to move the fish, and the responsibility to someone who knows what it knows s about someone who knows about someone else that doesn't know anything -- and so in most of course, it's not a disease, and so in not be died, and so in the patient.
There's a big marketing products of drugs, direct people like me and you, if you think about people like me and you, who you don't have any sense, data that we can't buy them.
But if we can't buy them, because do you public them for them?
The answer is that they want domor we call the doctor to change the recipe of changing us to change the recip.
And so it is so fundamental as our identity is a question of choice, as you see in this just" -- we don't want to force. We don't want to force. We will be able to provide their sex sex to the right moment of identity: we have to invent.
And we can reinventing us to reinvent.
which means that every morning to the answer to the answer to decide that kind of person wants to be like to be like.
And he respect to the family and marriage, a common time perspective, and content to everyone was that you could get the most pretty possible, and he was going to make the most possible, and he was going to make the preon possible.
The only true choice was with choice -- not when I don't even do that.
Ogame, everything is really to play.
I mean, I think about a very smart students and I do do 20 percent less working a time.
And because they don't are least brilliant, not because they are less diligent.
but why are they impensiers, I would ask to ask me to ask me or now?" I should do it?"
"I should get it later. I have to think about the hall? I have to think before the song?"
They're interrogative --
And they try to answer these questions, even if this implements don't completely to get the compites and you don't get a good vote to my example.
And they need to do it. They're important questions to do.
Now, the job: we're lucky, like Carl arl -- because technology allows us to work all allows us to work all the day, every day, from every day, from every day, from Hotel Randolph.
To parentess, there's a corn, and I'm not going to tell anyone where the Wich work.
I don't tell you that I want to use it.
What does it mean, this amazing liberty liberty that we have to work work? Is that we have to decide, if we have to work or not.
We can go to see our child playing how, with the cell phone in the tascar and the Blackberry in the other, and the news and the news and the eye teacher.
And even if they're all spent, every minute that we see our child resing the head, we are also asking them, we are also asking this called the "I have to answer this called the "I have to answer this called the "I have to answer this called called "I have to answer this called the head, we are also asking the head, we are also asking the head, we are also asking
"I have to get this email? I have to abboat this letter?"
And even when the answer is "us," all this makes the experience of your child very different than what would be in other conditions.
So, from any part of that we look at it, things like this, little and big objects and stils and living is a choices and life is a choice.
And once the world was this: Ove, there were some choices -- but it wasn't all of a choice.
The world today is like this: The dilemma is, "Is it -- "Is it a positive thing -- or negative negative thing?"
The answer is Sewing up.
The positive side of the negative we know all the negative negative negative negatives of the negative negatives of the negatives of the negative negatives.
This whole choice two negs effects two negative effects on people.
The first one, paradoxiety is that produces instead of free paralysis that free instead of freedox.
With a lot of options that chooses to do it.
I give you an example significant to you have to give you a conduct on the plans of volunteers.
A college had access to the Vank of Vancers of Vancertain ganti-founds, with about a million clients of though clients of clients in 2,000 different companies.
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are offered offered up in the percent, the percent.
With 50 sources are offers, there is 10 percent, and it will be available to when they were available only 5. Why?
Because with 50 sources that chooses -- it's a hardly hard to decide and choice is remained to the indemate and choice is remained to questions.
And to question, and asking questions, questions, and of course, won't stopped questions and of course, not going to be there.
You know, you don't just mean that these jobs will be a deal of the jobs of the cannot because they have enough money, it means that the decision is so ostic that decision is so ostic that they losing the foundation of works.
They don't participated, they're losing to 5000-dollars for a year from the working, which would be well to the crawing to the art them.
So the paralysis of having too many choices.
And I think it makes the world like this.
"And finally, for ethis: "eetchup, or major major major major major major major shee?"
You would like to take the right decision if it's for ethness, whether it's for ethis?
You don't want to choose the wrong source, and neps the wrong.
So this is the first effect. The second is that if we can avoid the paralysis and do a choice, we were less less satisfied from the result of how we would have been with less options in the way we would have been with less options in the way.
And this for different reasons.
One of these is that with a lot of conditions, which would choose and you buy one and it's not perfect and it's not perfect that you would have been better picking a different choices that would be better at the alternative alternative imagined that alternative imagined us to choice, and the remains of choice, and the remains of the revenient that you would have been better at the pressure of the pressure of the record of the rectable view of the
even when it was a good decision.
More choices us have to be easy to dispiact any details that it insodsatisfied that it was involved in choice.
But there is what economists are called opportunity.
Dan Gilbert asked a lot of bad stamack of the value that we depends on what we confrontive on what we confrontive it.
And in the means when there are many oppositions, it's easy to represent the alternative characteristics of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options that you have choice.
Here's an example. I sent with all those who are not in New York.
But it's what you probably would probably think of it.
There's this coum to Hamptons.
A place of lus.
It is all the way to the splendid. Otype day.
Nothing that he thinks is, "Well, what he thinks is, "Well, the males."
"Everything to Manhattan are vie."
"I could talk to your home."
And it turns two weeks ahead from the idea that is losing -- every day -- the chance of parking a cheek where you want.
The expensive opportunity diminises the soddisfation for what we have, even when the choice was excellent.
And the options that we have to consider themselves against the characteristics will be going to come back as expensive as expensive to the opportunity.
Here's another example.
This view is a lot of things.
It turns out to live the moment, and maybe living slowly.
But the most important point is that whatever you choice, you choices you don't do others.
The things that we don't choose have a lot of factive that can make less attention.
I mean, spiral growing of the expectations.
I tried to my skin, I would buy a new jeans.
I would almost like jeans.
One time the jeans were a type and they were bought to best, they were dissimiles, only after they beled them a lot of times, they were behind to go well.
So, I went to buy a new jeans when those old old old were gone, and I said, "I need a couple of jeans, this is my cute."
The ball, he said, "You want them to slim feasy fit?"
Would you like it with the cernic hed? "The Stonebones?
"You want to road them up?"
"Soth you want them to be, or strettty? By bag -- Continks.
I was swalm, and after a little I was able to say, "I want the only guy -- which was the only guy -- which was the only guy -- who was the only one one of the eans, and then I tried to all the eans, and then I went out of the negood, with the best jeans that I had ever been down.
It was the myself. With I had the best I had the best best.
But I felt I felt worst I heard about it.
Why? I wrote a book to understand it.
The reason I was worst worst is that I was worst with the whole choice were altish altish altish were altise.
And I had expectations. I didn't expected anything when I was expected it was only a guy when you see 100 different kind of in the way.
What I had watched was good -- but it doesn't perfect.
After I would have to be the choices that I was trying to put in the waiting aspectations.
The add options in life of people do not increase the expectations that these have respective of the options.
And this will produce less soddisftion, even when the results are good people.
No one in the world of marketing if you make it content.
Because if you know what I'm talking about, you won't know what I'm talking about.
The truth is more like this.
"You was better when he was wors; the reason he was wors." The reason he was going to be when you were worst when you were worst was even possible when you were worse was still possible to meet the pleasant to meet pleasant to meet the pleasant to meet of pleasant when you were worse.
Ogame, in the world where we live -- opulents, industrialized citizens with the expectancy -- the massive we can hope is that we can hope is that things are in the alteeting expectations.
You never have any surprised because you have your expectative, my expectative, you have ingiant ingigant.
The secret of happiness -- whose is you -- "Baspectactor "Yes, you want it."
I mean, small moment auobiographic moment -- which I really am married and my wife is really unstuff is really unexpensive.
I couldn't do better, I didn't have any case I didn't have a remarkable way.
But I can tell you don't always have a bad thing.
And finally, a couple of the buy jeans comfortable jeans when there is only one of the jeans is that when you don't know.
"Who is responsible?" "The answer is clear.
The world is responsible. What could I do do about that?
When there are hundreds of jeans of jeans, and you buy a satisfied a responsible that you have the responsible in responsible you to be in responsible that you are in your responsible you to you,
You could do it better.
With hundreds of variety are available to have been available,
So when people take decisions, even if the result is valid, they feel insatisfied and they give the same.
In the last years the depression is exploded in the industrialized world industrialized in the last few years ago.
I think a fact that a fact that a fact -- not the unique, but -- of this depression is that people have depression is that people have deludge experiences because the standard standard are too high.
And when they have to explain this situation think that the colp is they had.
So the final result is that we are better, we feel better, but we feel worse.
Let me remind you you remember it.
This is the official dog, what we all take for good and it's completely false. It's not true.
There is no doubt that a little bit better than I have no choice that you don't have a lot better than that I don't have a lot better than a lot of choices is better than a population.
There's a critical value, magic value. I don't know what it is.
But I'm sure we have over, that we have over, the best choices that choices our lives.
Now, from the political point -- I have almost finished -- from the political point of view, the cut.
What it allows you all this choice in the industrial industrial society is the wealth of material.
There are many places in the world, and you know you have a lot of these things that the problem isn't that have choice.
The problem is that they have too pocket.
So the face that I'm talking about is a bad to be a bad of modern, rich societies.
And what it makes to depress and arrabing is this: Steve Levitt you talked about iers and comfortable to you have talked about iers and comfortable to be useful in birth. It's a sprek.
I mean, that these choices, complicated and dispendous, it's not just useful to use.
They're addition deleteries.
They're going to make worse.
If a little bit of what in our societies allows a lot of choice was reversed in those where people have too choice has too poor better at the news.
This is what economists are called a better paretian.
One red-red-red-hype red-poor -- not only of the poor -- because of this choice in except that back to us.
And he would say, "File, you can become all of the thing that wants to --
You know, people of culture, you think, "What does that fish is that fished?"
"It's obvious that you can't make anything in a vetron bag in a vet."
"An imagination, a limited vision of the world."
and I ank-furning this to beginning.
But then, I think, I realized that weight the long weight knows that long time.
Because the reality of facts is that if you go into the bag broad, so that "all of it is possible." You don't get the freedom. You get the paralysis.
If you rops the mouse that all become possible to be decluster decreation.
You can take the paralysis, and you reduce the well.
Everybody needs a sphere.
This is almost certainly too streted, perhaps for us.
But the absence of some symbolic system for infelicity and temption, for the road room.
Thank you very much.
